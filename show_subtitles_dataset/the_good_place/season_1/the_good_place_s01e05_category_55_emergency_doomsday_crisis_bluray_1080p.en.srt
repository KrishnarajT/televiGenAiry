1
00:00:01,783 --> 00:00:03,910
Good afternoon, Eleanor.
What can I get you today?

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,913
Whoa! Lotta new flavours.

3
00:00:07,372 --> 00:00:10,291
Michael felt bad about the sinkhole,
so he wanted to give you all a little treat.

4
00:00:10,417 --> 00:00:13,044
I recommend "Full Cell phone Battery."

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,546
Whoa.

6
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:19,592
It somehow tastes how I felt
when my cell phone was fully charged.

7
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:21,135
Oh, I'm so relaxed!

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,012
But they all look good.

9
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:24,347
This might take me a while.

10
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:26,891
You know what, Gunnar?
Uh, why don't you go ahead?

11
00:00:27,184 --> 00:00:28,434
Thanks so much, Eleanor.

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,685
Mm-hmm.
- What can I get you, Gunnar?

13
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:32,104
Hi, Janet. Can I have some folded laundry?

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,481
Coming up.

15
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:45,618
Chidi!

16
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:47,161
You'll never believe it.

17
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,704
I was at the frozen yogurt place

18
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,748
and I didn't know what I wanted
so I turned to the guy behind me

19
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:53,167
and I was like: "Why don't you go ahead."

20
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:55,336
Just like that! "Why don't you go ahead."

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,296
Oh... okay.

22
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:58,714
Dude, you don't understand.

23
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,175
I never did stuff like that when I was on Earth!

24
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:04,720
But now, thanks to your "good person" lessons
I didn't hold up the line,

25
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,681
I didn't even try a dozen samples

26
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:09,809
I didn't want, just to spite some jerk
who told me I was holding up the line.

27
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:13,521
You do that?
- No, Chidi. I used to do that.

28
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:16,899
Now I do selfless things,
without even thinking about it.

29
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:19,318
I'm getting better.
- That's great.

30
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:20,820
I'm... I'm proud of you.

31
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:22,405
So where's our yogurt?

32
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,323
Ugh, I forgot it.

33
00:01:24,533 --> 00:01:27,118
Oh. Can you go?

34
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:28,286
I don't wanna go all the way back.

35
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,746
I ran all the way here and it was so hot.

36
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:36,168
I mean, I will happily get it
because I told you I would.

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,881
Good person.

38
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:51,934
So, to sum up. Utilitarianism posits that...

39
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:55,187
the correct choice is the one
that causes the most good

40
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:58,316
or pleasure, and the least pain and suffering.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,609
I like this one.

42
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:03,571
It's simple. Ugh. Screw all the other
complicated theories.

43
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:04,905
Why didn't you start with this one?

44
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,282
Ah, but here's the problem.

45
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,327
If all that matters is the sum total
of goodness

46
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:12,204
the you can justify anything number
of bad actions like...

47
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:16,083
torturing one innocent person
to save a hundred or pre-emptive war.

48
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:19,253
Oh, dip, I get it!
It's like, I knew this girl Sheila?

49
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:22,632
She was a black market alligator dealer,
with a pierced jawbone.

50
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,259
Um. Okay. What?

51
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:27,887
Sheila was gonna get married
to my boy Donkey Doug

52
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:29,889
and make him move to Sarasota.

53
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:31,891
It would have broken up my whole
breakdancing crew

54
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:34,477
and Donkey Doug was our best pop-and-locker!

55
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:38,981
So I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards
in Sheila's garage and called the cops.

56
00:02:39,608 --> 00:02:44,236
I framed one innocent gator dealer, to save
a sixty-person dance crew.

57
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:49,450
Shockingly, that is a relevant example
of the Utilitarian dilemma. Well done.

58
00:02:49,618 --> 00:02:51,160
Thanks! Um...

59
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,871
Ah, yes, Jianyu?

60
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:55,039
Can I be excused?

61
00:02:55,123 --> 00:02:59,043
Tahani's doing a brunch party and I want to
get there before all the mini-waffles run out.

62
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:02,380
Oh, it's the Good Place.
You can get all the mini waffles you want at any time.

63
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,590
So, I'm not excused?

64
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:07,009
Go ahead, man.
- Yes!

65
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,180
So, you want to roll right into
another lesson?

66
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:15,226
I am revved up to learn, man!
My brain is horny!

67
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,521
Can we take a little break?
I've been standing at this chalkboard all day.

68
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,481
Oh, yeah. I get it. Oh! You could, um...

69
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:23,025
grade my paper I wrote
on the concept of Dharma.

70
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:24,235
Six pages!

71
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,154
And I didn't even do that thing
where I tried to make it longer

72
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,615
by starting every sentence with,
"Interestingly".

73
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:31,659
Sure, I'll... I'll do that and

74
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:33,994
we can start another lesson.

75
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,335
Oh, I hope you are both enjoying this brunch.
This is a fabulous jacket.

76
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:44,296
Oh, you're both so attractive.
Hello, Jianyu.

77
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,132
Syrup?
- Oh, right there.

78
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,842
Chatty today, aren't we?

79
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:52,346
Ah, Tahani. I've been working on
my Western Hemisphere brunch banter.

80
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:53,639
Tell me what you think.

81
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,308
"That New Yorker article was crazy."

82
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,352
"You haven't seen Hamilton?"

83
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,146
"Hey, did you hear about Stephanie?"

84
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:02,898
- Very well done, Michael.
- Hi there!

85
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:06,193
We have a category 55
Emergency Doomsday Crisis.

86
00:04:07,988 --> 00:04:11,615
A category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:14,702
Sorry, what is a category 55
Emergency Doomsday Crisis?

88
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,371
It's nothing.
It's a tiny little inconvenience.

89
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,624
Tahani, dear,
could you show us to a private room

90
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,754
where no one could see or hear us,
even if I yell very loudly out of fear?

91
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:32,887
It appears that the sinkhole is not
repairing itself.

92
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:35,055
This is very bad, Janet.

93
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,725
We have to go into the sinkhole,
and fix it by hand.

94
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:38,976
Get the tools.

95
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:42,563
Sorry, can I be of any service?
- Ah! Tahani.

96
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:46,275
Didn't see you there...
No, we're just having a slight problem

97
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:48,903
with the enormous sinkhole.

98
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:52,239
Yes, I meant to tell you.
I walked past it last night and I...

99
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:53,949
I actually saw it get a little bit bigger.

100
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:59,413
It got bigger? Ah, well. That's so so normal.

101
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:03,542
This is the reaction I have when things
are incredibly mundane and expected.

102
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:09,757
I'm going to leave now, at my regular pace,
as I do in most scenarios.

103
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,183
Finally! Let's get back to it!

104
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:22,895
Whip out that chalkboard, big boy,
show me what you're working with!

105
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:27,817
Actually, I was going to head into town
and pick up some blankets.

106
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:31,111
Great, I'll grab my sweater. Plus...

107
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,030
I can practise letting people
cut in front of me.

108
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:35,950
Please. You go ahead. I respect you.

109
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,410
You're not just an obstacle
for me getting what I want.

110
00:05:38,495 --> 00:05:41,872
You know?
Uh, I just realised that I have blankets.

111
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:46,669
So I'm going to take a nap using the several
blankets that I already have. Good night!

112
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:50,673
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
What's wrong? Out with it.

113
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:53,300
Fine, I'm just tired.
Need a break. No big deal.

114
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:57,012
The way you're talking to me right now?
"Everything's cool,"no big deal."

115
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:57,930
I know that move.

116
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:01,892
When I told a boyfriend something was
"no big deal," it meant anything from

117
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:03,769
"I just bought weed from your nephew,"

118
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:06,522
to "I secretly befriended
your ex-girlfriend last year

119
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:08,691
things got out of hand
and now I'm her bridesmaid."

120
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:12,736
Wow. Okay, well,
in this case, it really is no big deal.

121
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:16,782
Dude, you're hiding something. What's wrong?
- Nothing.

122
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:22,580
What is wrong?

123
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:35,509
Jianyu second! Oh, well done, my love.

124
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:37,928
So where am I?

125
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:41,223
Eleanor sixth? Come on.

126
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:53,903
Oh, no. I'm second to last.

127
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,282
I barely made it.

128
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:03,078
Mummy, I made you this.
It's the pretty bird we saw in the garden.

129
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:06,123
Thank you, Tahani. It's very competent.

130
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:08,208
I made a bird as well.

131
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,377
I worked in reflective alloy

132
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:12,838
holding up a mirror to mankind and its

133
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,798
and its mistreatment of
these defenceless animals.

134
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:20,471
Excellent, Kamilah. I sense the influence
of Brancusi, and Kapur.

135
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:22,264
It seems you're moving out
of your structural period,

136
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:24,433
and more into conceptual abstraction.

137
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:27,811
Good eye, mother.
I grew tired of objective representation.

138
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,146
I trust my audience.

139
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:31,398
My birdie has a hat!

140
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:33,442
Yes. Well done, Tahani.

141
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,195
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

142
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,321
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

143
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:38,447
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

144
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:43,869
Nothing's wrong.
Would you stop doing that?

145
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:46,163
Okay, fine.
You want to know what's wrong?

146
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:48,415
You are a full-time job.

147
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:52,086
I wake up there's Eleanor.
I spend all day teaching Eleanor.

148
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,339
And then, it's "Good night, Eleanor.
Oh, this is a nice dream.

149
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:56,298
My grandma's here... wait!

150
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:59,551
She's got Eleanor's face!
And tentacles for some reason."

151
00:07:59,636 --> 00:08:02,972
Don't blame me for your weird grandma dreams.
That's on you, dude.

152
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:05,808
And I thought you liked teaching me.

153
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:10,062
So now I'm just some huge burden for you?
- Yes! Of course you are!

154
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:11,480
I am in paradise!

155
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:14,733
I should be doing paradise things,
like rowing out on a lake

156
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:17,027
with a good bottle of wine,
reading French poetry.

157
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:20,197
That's your idea of "paradise?" That sucks!

158
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:22,700
You know, and I can't stop helping you

159
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,077
because then I am shirking my ethical duty.

160
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:28,539
It's an impossible position!
- Well, excuse me

161
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:30,249
for trying to stay out of the Bad Place.

162
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:33,168
You know what, if you're so stressed
from writing on a chalkboard

163
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:34,461
why don't you just leave?

164
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,380
We could pretend to be soulmates in public

165
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:38,090
but other than that
we don't have to see each other!

166
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,259
Fine with me. I'll move out right now.
- Fine!

167
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:42,636
Good afternoon.

168
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,096
As you all may remember

169
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,016
a sinkhole recently opened up
in the town centre.

170
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,727
The situation, sadly, has worsened.

171
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:54,106
Starting right now no one may go outside
under any circumstances.

172
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,735
Leaving your homes
could result in catastrophic damage

173
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:01,030
to you and to the very fabric of the universe.

174
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:02,531
Okay, bye!

175
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,951
Or we could both just stay here.

176
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:12,416
We hope you enjoy
your eternal stay in the Good Place.

177
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:17,504
Take advantage of our day spa,
or Janet, a magical assistant.

178
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,256
who can get you whatever you want.

179
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:23,302
And explore the grounds on one of our
complimentary pegasi.

180
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:25,846
Do you mind turning that off?
It's been playing on a loop for two days.

181
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,434
The whole Neighbourhood is offline.
We only get the welcome channel.

182
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:32,978
I would love to not watch TV

183
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,397
but you cancelled school.

184
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:38,358
What have you done to me, you monster?

185
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:41,445
Look at all these dishes piling up.

186
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,657
I used to just throw them in the sink
and they'd be magically cleaned by morning.

187
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,327
I did that. I cleaned the dishes.
- Oh.

188
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,204
Then what's up with these bad boys?

189
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,332
You are unbelievable.

190
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,501
Are you still upset? You're not over it yet?

191
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:59,088
How can I be "over" it?
We haven't discussed it, or even spoken for days.

192
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:02,966
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice
"vacation" from your "full-time job."

193
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:05,469
Get your story straight, bro.

194
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:06,720
Hey, guys? It's Michael.

195
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:11,266
Hi, Michael! What a lovely surprise!

196
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,685
Oh, I'd love to make small talk.
I've been practicing, too.

197
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,438
I'm amazing at it.
But I'm in a bit of a rush here.

198
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:17,856
This is Bart and Nina

199
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,276
They live right next to the, uh...
sinkhole, so...

200
00:10:21,736 --> 00:10:23,278
they obviously need a place to stay.

201
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:26,281
I was wondering, as my assistant,
maybe you could put them up for a while?

202
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:30,160
Oh, of course. Don't... don't think twice.
- Okay. Shouldn't take long.

203
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:33,580
Between an hour and, um... eleven months.

204
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,749
Somewhere in there. Okay, bye!

205
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:38,585
Don't go outside.

206
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:50,305
We're doomed.

207
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,558
Dude. You need to chill the fork out.

208
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:54,351
How? We are living a lie.

209
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:57,771
We are fighting and one small mistake
could blow our cover

210
00:10:57,856 --> 00:10:58,939
and make the whole world go crazy.

211
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:02,067
All we need to do is make a little small talk.

212
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,111
Just say things that aren't lies.

213
00:11:04,362 --> 00:11:10,117
Like, isn't Eleanor super hot?
Or, I'm Chidi, I lost my virginity to a book.

214
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:11,368
Tea's ready!

215
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:14,830
Thank you guys so much.
Sorry for the imposition.

216
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,206
Oh, bah!

217
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:19,418
If you want to know the truth,
we asked Michael if we could stay with you.

218
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,879
We are obsessed with your relationship.

219
00:11:21,963 --> 00:11:24,715
Always whispering,
locking yourself in the house all day.

220
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:27,759
I thought I was an expert in true love
'cause of my old job

221
00:11:27,844 --> 00:11:30,345
but I have a lot to learn from you guys.

222
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:31,930
Your job? What was your job?

223
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,182
I was a marriage counsellor.

224
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:36,226
You could say I wrote the book
on healthy relationships

225
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:38,604
and I did!

226
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,150
It's called "How to Spot Problems
in a Marriage From 100 Miles Away."

227
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:44,693
Oh! Cool.
- Oh, cool.

228
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:46,403
Yeah, really cool.
- Cool. Cool.

229
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,655
Cool. And what about you, Bart?

230
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,866
Ah, well, my job wasn't nearly as
interesting.

231
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:53,577
Nah, I started a company
that investigated identity theft.

232
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:56,205
Analysing body language,
tracking and catching people

233
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,372
pretending to be someone they're not.

234
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,751
It was snooze, am I right?

235
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,797
You know what? Forget this tea.
Who wants too much wine?

236
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:08,217
Oh!

237
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:09,760
Hello, everyone

238
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:12,930
and welcome to Day Three
of our brunch siege!

239
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:16,850
I stayed up all night
to plan a full day of fun activities

240
00:12:17,143 --> 00:12:18,769
just check the schedule I made!

241
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:22,689
- Tahani, you are truly the best.
- Hear! Hear!

242
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:24,983
Yes, you would think so,
wouldn't you, Henriette?

243
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:31,865
Still second to last?

244
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:36,954
Tahani.

245
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:40,374
This auction threatens to be an
embarrassing failure.

246
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:43,377
Five-point-two million isn't bad.

247
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,545
It's very "middle-thermometer."

248
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:50,008
Your public failure is our public failure.

249
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,677
You know what has to be done.

250
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:53,679
I'm very pleased...

251
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:56,807
to announce that there has been an addition
to today's docket.

252
00:12:58,268 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm sure you all know my sister Kamilah.

253
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:05,899
Yes. Kamilah.

254
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:10,153
Kamilah, of course, is the youngest person
ever to graduate from Oxford University.

255
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:13,532
She's a Eurovision Award-winning
singer-song writer

256
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:16,326
a world-class painter, social activist

257
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:20,580
sculptor, Olympic gold medallist for archery

258
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,040
an iconoclast

259
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:27,963
A Bafta Award-winner for her documentary
on her Grammy Award-winning album

260
00:13:28,256 --> 00:13:32,134
and the person voted
"Most Likely to be Banksy."

261
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:36,513
So without further ado
take it away from me!

262
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,099
Sorry, I mean take it away, Kamilah!

263
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:45,147
I am auctioning off a lunch date with me.

264
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:49,568
The bidding shall commence
at three million pounds.

265
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:54,197
You're bidding?

266
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:58,118
Of course.
It's an hour with Kamilah Al-Jamil!

267
00:13:58,786 --> 00:13:59,828
Five million!

268
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:10,589
Wow. You guys must really love clowns, huh?

269
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:13,842
Would two people who didn't love clowns
have this many clowns on their walls?

270
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:16,678
It must be great to live with such
a positive person. Huh, Chidi?

271
00:14:16,763 --> 00:14:20,891
Well, it's um... at times it's... person.

272
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:26,480
Ugh. That's my Chidi.

273
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,857
One glass of wine, he's totally useless.

274
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,444
You know what you need right now, dear?

275
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:33,904
To get into something more comfortable

276
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:36,698
like one of your trademark
taupe V-neck sweaters.

277
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,493
You know how strongly I feel about those.

278
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:40,952
- Aw.
- Ooh..

279
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:42,329
So cute.

280
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,748
Oh, love, love, love!

281
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,249
Love, love, love!

282
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,089
You couldn't think of one thing to say?
Get your head in the game, man.

283
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:53,173
They're gonna catch us.

284
00:14:53,257 --> 00:14:57,177
This is an extremely precarious situation.
I am vexed, Eleanor!

285
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,471
A marriage counsellor
and a human lie detector

286
00:14:59,555 --> 00:15:03,809
isn't my first choice for company either,
but they have no reason to suspect us.

287
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:09,147
Plus, I think they may have actually
just come here to, you know?

288
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:10,565
Swing.

289
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:12,692
I say we do it.

290
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:14,486
It'll get them to stop asking questions.

291
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:18,865
I am not going to have sex with someone
to get them to stop talking to me.

292
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,076
Really? You and I are very different.

293
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,662
Yeah, I noticed.
- You know what, man?

294
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,748
I have spent every second in this place
worried I was gonna get caught

295
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,835
but if we go down right now,
that's on you. Okay?

296
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,088
Oh, you spend all your time teaching a
charming, awesome lady?

297
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:35,715
How sad for you. Face it, dude.

298
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,429
I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.
Because guess what, Chidi? Ya basic.

299
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:43,890
Eleanor.
- Yeah, I know. You wanna do that thing

300
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:47,477
where we're arguing and fighting,
but then suddenly it's like "Whoa, this is hot,"

301
00:15:47,562 --> 00:15:49,354
and we start making out? Dream on!

302
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:50,772
Or, whatever, fine, let's just do it.

303
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:52,274
No! Eleanor, look.

304
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:01,950
So, how much of that did you hear?

305
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:04,619
We couldn't hear you but I'm an expert
in non-verbal communication

306
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,038
and it is clear you are in conflict.

307
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:10,125
We're not judging you.
This has been a tough couple of weeks.

308
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:14,337
I'm sure the... the stress of the sinkhole
has caused lots of soulmate squabbles.

309
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:19,968
That's what it is! A squabble. We're squabbling.
- Squabble-squabble!

310
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,429
I can help.
I'm going to take your relationship

311
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:24,264
and put it under a microscope

312
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:27,309
And dig and poke and prod

313
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:30,353
until you are back to soulmate harmony.

314
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,688
Eleanor, why don't you tell...

315
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:34,274
She never does the dishes.
I have to do them all the time.

316
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:37,194
We just have different interests.
- Mm-hmm.

317
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,947
I like relaxing, he likes getting
on my case about the dishes.

318
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:42,824
I'm getting a lot of repressed anger.

319
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:45,410
I suspected this when I arrived,
but now I'm sure.

320
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,871
You are hiding something.

321
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:50,415
What are earth would I be hiding?
- No, no, no, not you...

322
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,459
Him.

323
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:57,297
Please go back inside.

324
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:01,426
It isn't safe to be out of your home.
Please go back inside.

325
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:03,261
Janet, could you see what's wrong?

326
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:04,804
Everything.

327
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:07,224
Oh!

328
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:10,519
My goodness. It's even worse than I thought.

329
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,103
Tahani, what are you doing here?

330
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:15,482
Well, everyone else might be okay
staying inside, but I wanted to help.

331
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:19,277
So I brought some cheer
and sustenance, to raise your spirits.

332
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,570
Look, I made donut holes.

333
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:25,492
Do you get it? Donut holes,
sinkhole. Funny, no?

334
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:28,620
No, too soon. By exactly nine days.

335
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:31,706
Tahani, this sinkhole is incredibly
dangerous.

336
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:35,418
If a human gets too close to it
there could be disastrous side effects.

337
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:38,713
What's... what's happening to me?

338
00:17:38,756 --> 00:17:40,382
Ooh, that's one of the side effects.

339
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:42,759
Janet, knock her out,
while we still have time, please.

340
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:45,178
Knock me out? What does that...

341
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:51,351
Guys, really, it's no big deal.

342
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:56,147
"It's not a big deal" is nearly always
code for "something is wrong."

343
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:58,108
Boom! That's what I said!

344
00:17:58,192 --> 00:17:59,526
I should've been a marriage counsellor.

345
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,737
Lets take the positive aspects
of this relationship.

346
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:04,239
Let's focus on that first.

347
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,242
What do you do to make Eleanor feel valued?

348
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:14,624
I spend every waking moment thinking
about her and supporting her.

349
00:18:15,084 --> 00:18:16,334
Beautifully said.

350
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,962
Eleanor, what do you do to support Chidi?

351
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,463
I...

352
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:25,385
taught him how to reheat cold pizza
with a curling iron.

353
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:30,140
But this isn't about me
or my awesome life hacks.

354
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:32,642
He's hiding something,
and we need to get to the bottom of it.

355
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,477
She's right, Chidi. Out with it.

356
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,731
What is so unsatisfying about
your soulmate relationship?

357
00:18:37,815 --> 00:18:40,317
Be honest, Chidi. Be like...

358
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,737
the exact right amount of honest

359
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:46,197
so that we can both be happy.

360
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,036
I never had a soulmate on earth.

361
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:56,249
I never even really had a girlfriend
that I loved.

362
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,421
And when I got here and Michael said
I would finally meet my actual soulmate

363
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,923
I was so excited. And it isn't...

364
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:06,843
exactly...

365
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:09,095
what I thought.

366
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:12,515
You've never had
an intense relationship before.

367
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,934
This is all uncharted territory.

368
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,312
No wonder you're so tense!

369
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:21,691
You know, Nina and I are skilled
in the art of massage.

370
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:24,402
Not erotic massage.
- Mm.

371
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:27,155
- Although it can be, it often leads there anyway.
- Okay!

372
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,490
Well, you know what?

373
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:32,035
You guys have given us so much to think about
and I think we should go to bed.

374
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:34,496
Just the two of us, alone.
Just us.

375
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:36,790
I know it's not the right time,
but I told you.

376
00:19:36,874 --> 00:19:39,542
You know after an
emotional breakthrough like that

377
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:42,295
you guys aren't gonna do much sleeping.

378
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,797
Yeah, I know.

379
00:19:44,006 --> 00:19:49,678
We're gonna keep our clothes. I'll sleep on the floor
and we'll maintain a chilly silence until morning.

380
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,513
Could you imagine?

381
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:55,725
Well, that's terrifying.
- Mm.

382
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:00,522
Tahani? Wake up, dear.

383
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:04,150
Michael, did it work?

384
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:06,403
Did I fix the sinkhole?

385
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:07,570
Am I a heroine?

386
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:12,117
No. You did something catastrophically stupid
and we had to knock you unconscious.

387
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:14,661
Why in the world did you go outside?

388
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:17,747
Because I saw the rankings in the manual.

389
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:21,626
That manual is only meant to be seen
by Architects and Janets.

390
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:24,337
It's got some very sensitive material.

391
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:28,299
Plus some song lyrics I've been working on,
and I'd rather not let people see those

392
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:29,467
until they're finished.

393
00:20:29,969 --> 00:20:31,261
But, anyway...

394
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:34,681
Why did seeing the rankings unravel you so?

395
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:40,770
I was so sorry to hear
of your parents' passing.

396
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:44,107
Please bear with me as I share
their last will and testament.

397
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,901
To Kamilah, we have left
sixty-eight million pounds

398
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:51,990
the home in Kensington, their yacht,
and other assorted weekend boats.

399
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,076
But what did they leave
their second-favourite child?

400
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,913
There's still quite a lot of
money and property that goes to you.

401
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:00,665
There is one issue, however.

402
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,627
They have, um...
spelled your name incorrectly, in the will.

403
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,045
You've got to be kidding me.

404
00:21:06,255 --> 00:21:11,050
It says, "We bequeath the rest
of our estate to Tahini." Like the sauce.

405
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:14,262
You know what? I don't want the money.

406
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,890
My sister can have it all.

407
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:22,437
My whole life I have lived in your shadow,
but now I'm going to step out of it.

408
00:21:22,688 --> 00:21:27,650
I am going to reach heights of success
and sophistication you could only dream of.

409
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:29,402
Your cardigan's on inside out.

410
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:33,782
I know! It's a new trend that I am starting.

411
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:36,743
Just one example of how I'm going
to step out of your shadow.

412
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:40,121
Oh, please wait.
I'm obligated to say one more thing.

413
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,124
Kamilah, I'm taken by you.

414
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:46,753
Your very presence is magnetic.

415
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:51,257
I may be married and I've never been interested
in any woman before

416
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:55,678
but my attraction for you
goes beyond sexuality.

417
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:59,182
Though it certainly is deeply sexual.

418
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:03,186
Oh, for crying out loud! Come on!

419
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:08,441
Oh, I'm sorry that I looked
at the rankings, Michael.

420
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:11,528
But I just don't understand
how I'm so low.

421
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:14,781
My entire life I have tried to be
extraordinary

422
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:16,491
but it just never seemed to be enough.

423
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:22,664
Ah. And you thought you could increase
your ranking by helping us fix the sinkhole.

424
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:24,499
Tahani.

425
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:28,461
Tahani, the point evaluations stop
the moment you die.

426
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:32,131
But also, out of literally billions

427
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,844
you were one of the most remarkable people
on Earth.

428
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:40,139
You have nothing left to prove, to anyone.

429
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:41,933
Hi there!

430
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:44,435
The sinkhole has begun to repair itself!

431
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:45,603
It has?

432
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:47,021
Could it be?
- But how?

433
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:50,859
Did I, "Tahani saves the uni—"
- No, no, no, still not you.

434
00:22:50,985 --> 00:22:53,194
You had nothing to do with it.
We'd better leave immediately.

435
00:22:57,867 --> 00:22:58,908
Oh. Morning, Chidi.

436
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:01,077
Michael just lifted the lockdown.
We can all go outside again.

437
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:04,455
Say goodbye to Eleanor for us.
Oh, she left you a note by the dishes.

438
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,878
And if you ever want to come to our house,
break out the massage oils

439
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:12,130
And, uh... see what unfolds.

440
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:15,842
Okay. Great. Thank you, Nina.

441
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:25,435
Morning, teach!

442
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,313
Morning. What's this about?

443
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:30,148
Well, here's what I realised.

444
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:34,068
It's not just that helping me is a full-time
job that you feel you have to do.

445
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:38,031
The real problem is that
the more you help me

446
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:42,452
the greater the chance is that I can stay
here, and me staying here means

447
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:44,495
you'll never get a real soulmate.

448
00:23:45,581 --> 00:23:47,832
I'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.

449
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:51,836
Every ounce of my happiness
leads to a ton of pain for you.

450
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,798
So, every time
the simple fact of my existence

451
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:57,508
starts to bum you out

452
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,595
I want you to hold this up.

453
00:24:01,597 --> 00:24:03,306
At which point

454
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:06,267
I will leave you alone,
for as long as you need.

455
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:09,979
I know we'll never be soulmates,
but we're friends.

456
00:24:10,689 --> 00:24:13,066
So I'm going to help you have the paradise
you always wanted.

457
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:17,362
Side note, I can't believe this is
the paradise you always wanted, but...

458
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:20,949
get in this boat,
and read some boring French poetry.

459
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:35,755
I... I've never actually done this before.
This is... this is a theoretical fantasy.

460
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:37,799
How do you row a boat?

461
00:24:38,884 --> 00:24:41,219
I tell you, it's good as new.
Go ahead, if you want. Just here.

462
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:43,763
Whoo! See? You can jump up and down on it.

463
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:46,057
Hey boss, so you fixed the sinkhole?

464
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,393
Yep! Good as new! Crisis averted!

465
00:24:48,477 --> 00:24:52,230
Everybody, have a wonderful day
because I fixed the sinkhole.
