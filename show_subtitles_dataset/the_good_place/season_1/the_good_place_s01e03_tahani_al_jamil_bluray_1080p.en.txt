1
00:00:01,348 --> 00:00:04,684
So, Aristotle was Plato's student

2
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:08,312
and Aristotle believes
that your character is voluntary

3
00:00:08,355 --> 00:00:11,482
because it's just the result
of your actions

4
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,610
which are under your control!

5
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:20,199
For example, right now,
you have made the insane choice

6
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:23,327
to ignore the person
who is literally trying to save you

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,913
from eternal damnation.
- No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

8
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:26,998
Uh, I just...

9
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,917
are we sure we should be
paying attention to these guys?

10
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:32,879
It's like, who died
and left Aristotle in charge of ethics?

11
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:35,423
Plato.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,967
Uh, coming!

13
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:40,178
Uhm... We're just kissing!

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,181
And groping?
- What?

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,852
Hello!

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,313
Tahani, hi!

17
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:52,482
What brings you here?
- You know, I was just, uh...

18
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,567
"in the Neighbourhood."

19
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:56,194
Do you get it, Eleanor?

20
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:58,070
Because you know
we're all in the same afterlife

21
00:00:58,113 --> 00:00:59,530
so you know I'm always
"in the Neighbourhood!"

22
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:00,948
Do you get it?

23
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,242
I do. And it's delightful.

24
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:05,661
Anyway, this is for you.

25
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:08,414
Just a housewarming plant!
It's a little reminder that

26
00:01:08,457 --> 00:01:11,542
if there's ever anything that you need,
I am right next door.

27
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:12,877
How could I possibly forget?

28
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:14,837
Have a great day, Tahani.

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,796
Oh. Bye.

30
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:20,092
Ugh. Tahani.

31
00:01:20,594 --> 00:01:22,470
"Welcome to the Neighbourhood

32
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:24,639
even though we all arrived here
at the same time!

33
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:27,975
Here's some dirt I put in a bowl,
because I'm amazing!"

34
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,771
I thought it was kind of a nice gesture.

35
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:35,149
Oh, Chidi. It's a total con.

36
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:38,027
She only does things like this
so that we will talk about

37
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,697
how "thoughtful" and "wonderful" she is,
but I see through her little act.

38
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,826
Her act of being a nice person
who brings you gifts?

39
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,079
Bingo.
- Okay, I'll... I'll remind you

40
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:50,957
that you're trying
to learn how to be a good person.

41
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:52,416
Mm-hmm.
- Maybe you should

42
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,585
return the favour - bring her something.

43
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:58,756
Oh, so now I'm supposed to be nice
and make friends

44
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,467
and treat her with mutual respect?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,887
That's exactly what she wants me to do,
Chidi. Wake up!

46
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:09,684
That... that's what everyone
wants everyone to do.

47
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:18,067
Hello, Chidi!

48
00:02:18,277 --> 00:02:20,069
No frozen yoghurt for you this morning?

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,405
Oh, uh... no, just, uh...
doing some reading.

50
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:23,698
Ah, been there, brother.

51
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,950
Workin' hard or hardly workin',
am I right?

52
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:26,951
Hump day.

53
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:28,494
Uh, sorry.

54
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:32,290
Janet's functioning as my assistant
but she's a little stiff

55
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:35,710
so I've been trying to get her to be
a little more casual and conversational.

56
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:37,837
I'll have what she's having!

57
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,255
It's a work in progress.

58
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:40,339
Listen, Chidi.

59
00:02:41,383 --> 00:02:44,802
I've been studying your file -
you're a very interesting case.

60
00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:47,638
You essentially only did one thing
while you were on Earth

61
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:49,807
you thought and wrote about ethics.

62
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,059
Yes. I... I spent eighteen years

63
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,477
working on my manuscript...
- Right.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,896
called "Who We Are and Who We Are Not..."
- No, no, I...

65
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,607
"colon - Practical Ethics and Their...
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:59,275
Application in the Modern World...
- Yes. Right.

67
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,360
semi-colon - a Treatise on the..."
- Yes, yes, yes!

68
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:02,737
That's... that's the one.

69
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:07,783
But searching for moral truths
isn't really relevant anymore.

70
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:11,787
Because here in the Good Place
we actually know all the answers.

71
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:15,458
I think you should experience
new adventures, you know

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,543
do things that you haven't done on Earth.

73
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:21,756
Right? So why don't we meet tomorrow
and try out some new hobbies.

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,716
Uh, why not?

75
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,384
I'll... I'll see you guys tomorrow.

76
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:26,761
Not if I see you first.

77
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:29,305
Where's the beef?

78
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:30,973
I don't know.
- Hump day.

79
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:35,394
Hello, Eleanor!

80
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:38,064
Jianyu, darling, look -
it's Eleanor from next door!

81
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:39,523
Is he asleep?

82
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:41,942
You know, there's really no way to tell.

83
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:43,861
You know one time
I actually thought he was dead.

84
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:45,696
But then I remembered
we're all dead, aren't we?

85
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,032
Such fun. Come in! Come on in!

86
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,159
What brings you to our home,
my dear?

87
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:53,537
Well, I'm simply repaying your kind gift

88
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,624
with a housewarming gift of my own.
Fresh pears.

89
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:00,711
It's a plant, just like your gift,
but you can actually eat them

90
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,380
so maybe it's a better gift?

91
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:05,299
Who's to say?
- That's so kind.

92
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,553
However, in, um... Chinese culture,
pears are actually a symbol of bad luck.

93
00:04:09,596 --> 00:04:12,014
And I don't want to offend Jianyu,
so I'm afraid

94
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:13,391
I'm going to have
to throw these in the garbage.

95
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,934
But do come and sit down!

96
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:20,856
We haven't even had a chance to discuss
all of the mayhem in our neighbourhood yet.

97
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,274
It's so disconcerting.

98
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:24,568
Yes.
What do you think is causing it?

99
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:25,945
Oh, I'm sure I don't know.

100
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:27,780
But we must keep our heads up.

101
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:30,616
In fact, tomorrow I'm actually going
door-to-door to make sure

102
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,993
that every single person
in this entire neighbourhood

103
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:35,413
is "keeping calm and carrying on."

104
00:04:35,706 --> 00:04:36,997
'Cause I think that helping others

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,458
will make me feel
like I truly belong here, you know?

106
00:04:44,047 --> 00:04:46,590
Here's a brainstorm -
why don't I go with you?

107
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:50,177
I mean, I would love to do my part
to help the neighbourhood -

108
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,888
not to mention get a little bonding time
with you, lady!

109
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,181
Oh, hurrah!

110
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,642
Such fun!

111
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,603
I'm telling you, Tahani's out to get me.

112
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:02,189
Wha-what are you talking about?

113
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:05,067
This note was slipped
under my door yesterday.

114
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:08,195
It has to be Tahani.

115
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:11,615
She just said to me,
"I want to feel like I truly belong here."

116
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:14,118
Well, where have I seen
the word "belong" recently?

117
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:15,453
Oh, yeah - Ka-plow!

118
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:19,206
Okay, I really don't think she's the type
of person who would write this.

119
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:21,709
She is that kind of person,
and she did write it.

120
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:25,212
She wants everybody to think
she's such a perfect princess

121
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:29,258
just 'cause she's tall, and glamorous,
and has cappuccino skin

122
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:32,428
and curves everywhere,
and now I'm complimenting her.

123
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:33,929
And kind of turned on!

124
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:36,599
The point is,
she straight-up sucks, bro.

125
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,060
Whoa...

126
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:41,937
Typical Tahani.

127
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:45,524
Brings us a faulty plant, so she can brag
about being a better gardener.

128
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:51,322
No - I think this is another way in which
your negative actions affect this world.

129
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:54,533
This plant represents
your relationship to Tahani

130
00:05:54,576 --> 00:05:58,245
so when you're mean to her,
it starts to wilt.

131
00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:01,707
Well, then this plant is doomed,
because tomorrow I'm going with her

132
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,086
and I'm gonna prove to you and to everyone
that she is secretly a two-faced

133
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:08,172
calculating, phony bench.

134
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:13,052
Yeah, truth hurts, doesn't it, plant?

135
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,598
Hello!

136
00:06:17,808 --> 00:06:19,266
Oh! Come on in.

137
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:20,392
I'll be ready in a jiff.

138
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:23,145
Jianyu, darling, look -
it's Eleanor from next door again!

139
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:24,647
The one who brought
the offensive fruit.

140
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,400
Ah, yes. What an embarrassing
blunder on my part.

141
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:30,152
Oh, no. Don't give it a second thought.

142
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:33,280
I wouldn't expect anyone else to have
my understanding of international etiquette.

143
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:37,868
Hey, um... any idea why they gave you
such a big house?

144
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:42,414
I mean, if we were in America
and... and you had like a big truck

145
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:45,167
I would think you might be
compensating for something.

146
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:48,337
Yes, well American men can be very silly.

147
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:49,880
You know I used to do
quite a cutting impression

148
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:51,799
of an ex-boyfriend of mine
from the States.

149
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:55,594
He'd be all like,
"Hey, I'm so rich. I have nine houses.

150
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:57,471
I'm Leonardo DiCaprio."

151
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,598
It's just so silly.

152
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:02,726
Anyway, I should've guessed that you
would want to help our neighbourhood.

153
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:05,062
We are birds of a feather,
you and I.

154
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:08,148
We make every effort
to be our best selves.

155
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:09,233
Mmm.

156
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,236
Hey, babe. Got you coffee.

157
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:13,487
Ah, great.

158
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:14,822
Oh. Andy's Coffee?

159
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,991
Uh, we shouldn't go there.
Everybody's boycotting.

160
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:19,743
Yeah, I know that one guy found
a scorpion in his latte.

161
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:21,662
I don't really care, though,
'cause it's so close to here.

162
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:23,789
No, no, no, no, it's because
he's sexually harassing people.

163
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:27,209
Look, a journalist went undercover
for an interview and recorded him.

164
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,335
Here, watch.

165
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:32,256
Here's the thing, sweetheart.
You are very qualified, but you're also

166
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:34,967
what we call in the coffee shop game,
a "dog-face."

167
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,469
You're a three,
and you have to be a nine to work here.

168
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:38,470
It's just math.

169
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,265
So, I didn't get the job?

170
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:44,226
No! Dog-face,
you didn't get the job.

171
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:46,812
All right,
I'll check your references.

172
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,648
Just to be...
- Hey, my breasts!

173
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:52,234
nice, I'll check them.
Oh! They're good. Honk!

174
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,361
I mean this guy's a monster.
We can't support this guy.

175
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:56,155
Okay, hey, you're not better than me

176
00:07:56,197 --> 00:07:58,949
just 'cause you won't support a guy
who grabbed a boob once.

177
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,619
No, I'm just saying we shouldn't go there.

178
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:02,953
We can get coffee somewhere else.

179
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:04,413
Did you know
your left reference

180
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,165
is a little bit bigger
than your right reference?

181
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,417
It's not a bad thing.
It's just... it's a thing.

182
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,921
This is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi.

183
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,005
Cartography!

184
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:16,091
Your neighbourhood stretches way
beyond what you've already seen.

185
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:18,761
And you can map it

186
00:08:19,137 --> 00:08:22,139
revealing all
of the mysteries, like an explorer!

187
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:23,933
I see how that might be fun.

188
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:27,019
Uh, but exploring makes me nervous.

189
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:29,813
I have what doctors call
"directional insanity."

190
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,732
I once got lost on an escalator.

191
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:33,943
So, not exactly Christopher Columbus.

192
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:36,320
Fun fact - Columbus is in the Bad Place

193
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:39,031
because of all the raping,
slave trade, and genocide.

194
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:43,410
The fact that it makes you nervous is exactly
why you should do it.

195
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,079
You know,
get out of your comfort zone.

196
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:46,330
Become a trailblazer.

197
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:50,668
Fun fact - all deceased members
of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team

198
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,670
are also in the Bad Place.

199
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:53,921
Ah. Yeah.

200
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,007
Sorry about this.
I steered her away from colloquialisms

201
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,885
and into "fun facts" and trivia titbits.

202
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:01,929
I thought it'd be more
in her wheelhouse.

203
00:09:01,972 --> 00:09:04,640
Fun fact - a "wheelhouse"
is a part of a boat.

204
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,141
Okay, thank you, Janet.
Thank you.

205
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:07,685
Fun fact - Janet is me.

206
00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:09,520
All right, let's forget about exploring.

207
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:11,605
Plenty more ideas for hobbies.

208
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:13,232
Let's walk back to town, shall we?

209
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:16,151
Okay. Hang on.

210
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,070
Wrong way!
- Yep!

211
00:09:20,365 --> 00:09:23,659
So all I want to do is just check in,
see how everyone's holding up -

212
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:26,328
just bring some cheer
to these extraordinary people.

213
00:09:26,621 --> 00:09:27,496
Cool.

214
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,207
So tell me about yourself.

215
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:35,045
I mean, I want to hear it all, girlfriend!
The good, the bad, the really bad,

216
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,755
the embarrassing, the humiliating...

217
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:38,173
just... let's bond!

218
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,970
Okay. Well, I... I was born in Pakistan,
raised in London, schooled in Paris.

219
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:45,014
But I think the primary reason
I'm in the Good Place

220
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:47,599
is that I raised quite a lot of money
for non-profit groups.

221
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:51,854
Oh! Did you ever, uh...
skim a little off the top, for yourself?

222
00:09:52,188 --> 00:09:55,774
Gracious, no! No!
Every penny was accounted for.

223
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,152
And as I raised nearly sixty billion dollars

224
00:09:58,194 --> 00:09:59,945
that was quite a lot of pennies!

225
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:02,156
But I also dabbled
in some other professions.

226
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:06,076
I was a model, a museum curator,
and "It Girl," and...

227
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,620
oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's muse
for a while.

228
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:09,580
That was quite fun.

229
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,915
Modelling - that's a crazy life.

230
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,668
Wanna tell me about that rock-bottom
you probably hit?

231
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:15,878
Oh, I didn't really do it for long.

232
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,296
Couture just doesn't fit my body.

233
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,881
I'm cursed with ample bosom.

234
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:21,550
And yet, you soldier on!
- Oh, this is silly.

235
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:24,636
So, "Tahani" means
"congratulations" in Arabic

236
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,305
and Al-Jamil means "beautiful."

237
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:27,598
So my full name all together means...

238
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,183
"Congratulations, Beautiful."

239
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:31,518
Thanks, Eleanor! You big flirt.

240
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:36,106
Extra! Extra!

241
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:38,525
Read all about you!

242
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:42,488
Chidi, this is the perfect hobby
for you - journalism.

243
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:45,115
Well, obviously, I... I like to write.

244
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:47,993
But I don't love deadlines.

245
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:49,578
I prefer to take my time with things.

246
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:50,496
Yes, I know.

247
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:53,040
Uh, you never even named your dog,
did you?

248
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:57,669
When it ran away, you posted signs saying,
"Responds to long pauses."

249
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,965
Look, Chidi. I'm just trying to find you
a hobby that - the hat -

250
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:04,635
that will bring you
a positive experience.

251
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:05,844
What do you say?

252
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:07,846
I'm loving that hat on you.

253
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:12,142
It would look even better on my floor.
- What is happening now?

254
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:13,727
I suggested she be friendlier.

255
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,022
She seems to have slipped
right into overt sexuality.

256
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:18,732
I got something you can slip into.

257
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:22,236
Oh...
- Janet, no! No, Janet!

258
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,697
Well, Glenn, we just wanted
to make sure you were all right.

259
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,032
Tahani! You're too sweet!

260
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:29,493
Oh.
- Isn't she just the nicest person?

261
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:30,410
Mm-hmm.

262
00:11:30,578 --> 00:11:32,496
That is what a lot of people
are saying.

263
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:34,581
Oh, everyone I know is saying that.
- Yeah.

264
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:37,584
It's just a big neighbourhood
full of enormous mansions

265
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:38,961
and people who love Tahani!

266
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:41,547
There's also a heck of a lot of yoghurt.

267
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:45,467
Excellent observation, Glenn.

268
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:49,304
Eleanor and I just want to see
if there's anything we can do to help you?

269
00:11:49,347 --> 00:11:50,931
Oh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful!

270
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:54,685
Despite all the chaos earlier,
we simply couldn't be happier.

271
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:56,436
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli!

272
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,105
Please take a maple butter scone.

273
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,523
I made them fresh this morning!

274
00:11:59,774 --> 00:12:01,608
Ooh, they look a bit burnt.

275
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:05,654
But they're not.

276
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:08,115
Hmm. Oh, fork, that's good!

277
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,200
Okay!

278
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:12,286
Arc welding!
You could learn sculpture

279
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,662
you could make furniture

280
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:16,290
you could get your hands a little greasy,
you know, and you make things!

281
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:21,503
And, by the way, this is an exact replica
of Brancusi's workshop in Paris.

282
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:23,839
This equipment is very scary.

283
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:26,675
Don't be a baby. It can't hurt you.

284
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,553
Watch. I'll blowtorch your face off.
- Janet!

285
00:12:29,804 --> 00:12:32,055
Whatever.
This whole thing is stupid.

286
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:33,599
Oh, brother.

287
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:36,268
I told her to be less flirty.

288
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:38,896
Now she's cruel and distant,
apparently.

289
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:40,272
I just can't get this right.

290
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:43,358
Thank you for trying to find me
a new hobby, uh...

291
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,402
but I just want to be an academic.

292
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:48,030
I want to keep working
on my manuscript.

293
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:51,366
Chidi, here's the thing.

294
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:55,412
See, I... I read your whole book -
all thirty-six hundred pages of it.

295
00:12:55,663 --> 00:12:58,207
It's, um... how shall I put this?

296
00:12:58,374 --> 00:12:59,249
It's a mess, dude.

297
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:01,043
Hey!

298
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:02,628
She's right.

299
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:07,257
You see, Chidi, I can read the entirety
of the world's literature in about an hour.

300
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:10,260
This took me two weeks to get through.

301
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:11,929
I mean, it's so convoluted!

302
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:14,806
I just kept reading the same paragraph
over and over again

303
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:17,142
trying to figure out
what the heck you were saying.

304
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:18,310
Oh, no.
- I mean, on...

305
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:22,814
on page one thousand,
you start section two with the sentence -

306
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:25,859
"Of course,
the exact opposite might be true."

307
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:32,324
You're a brilliant guy, Chidi,
but you just kept revising, and rewriting

308
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:33,992
and adding words to your title.

309
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:36,536
I think you just twisted yourself up
into a knot.

310
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:38,372
I have a very bad stomach ache.

311
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,209
Oh, Jianyu, darling,
would you like some tea?

312
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:46,546
That nod meant "no," apparently.

313
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,258
Well, it was nice to get out
and meet all of our wonderful neighbours.

314
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,094
They all truly belong here.

315
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:54,388
Mmm. Yes, they do, cutie pants!

316
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,305
Boop!

317
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,099
Well! I should really be going.
I have to begin

318
00:13:57,141 --> 00:13:59,685
my twelve-step
Korean skin care regimen but, uh...

319
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,061
I'll see you... oh, no, no, no.

320
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:02,938
Please, stay
and enjoy the evening tea.

321
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:03,855
I'll see you soon.

322
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:09,111
I can't even tell if you've kissed
my cheek or the air around it.

323
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:11,697
Oh. Thank you. That's the goal.

324
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:12,948
Boop!

325
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:29,756
"The Diary of Tahani Al-Jamil."

326
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:32,968
Hey, man!

327
00:14:35,305 --> 00:14:36,179
What's wrong?

328
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:37,723
Am I a good teacher?

329
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:40,559
Am I... am I clear, do I make sense?

330
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:43,729
Yeah, you're a great teacher!
I'm super ethical now.

331
00:14:44,522 --> 00:14:45,605
What's that?
- Hmm?

332
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,482
Nah... Don't worry about it.

333
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,489
I stole Tahani's diary so I could see
if her handwriting matches the note

334
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:58,493
and also read about all the mean
and terrible things she's definitely done

335
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:00,537
so I can prove she's actually evil.

336
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:05,542
Huh.

337
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:08,378
What do you think that means?

338
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,380
It's tough to interpret.

339
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,341
Feels positive though.

340
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:18,889
You stole Tahani's diary?

341
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:21,350
I know I broke some ethical rule
but I had good reason.

342
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:25,729
Eleanor. In order to be a good person
you have to do good things.

343
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:30,108
And not stealing people's stuff,
that is just a basic kindergarten rule.

344
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:33,445
I mean, do I also have to tell you
to not throw sand?

345
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:35,906
First of all, throwing sand
is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire.

346
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:36,948
Why would you even know that?

347
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:39,284
Second of all, I know
that it may not be "nice"

348
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:42,496
but neither is pretending to be
one hundred percent perfect

349
00:15:42,538 --> 00:15:43,705
like Tahani does.

350
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:46,333
She wrote that note.
- No, she didn't!

351
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:47,667
You did!

352
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:51,671
I... I was hoping you would come
to this conclusion on your own

353
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:56,093
but obviously, no one here
would ever threaten you.

354
00:15:56,511 --> 00:16:00,222
That note is the Good Place
manifesting your own guilt -

355
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:05,519
like with the plant, or when you literally
made giant shrimp fly through the air.

356
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:08,397
I wrote myself the note!

357
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:12,234
And as it turns out I do belong here

358
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:14,236
because I'm just as good as everyone else.

359
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:17,864
And... and nobody is at fault for anything.

360
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,826
Oh! You, sir, are an excellent teacher.

361
00:16:20,868 --> 00:16:23,161
No, no, no. You don't belong here.

362
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:26,164
And in this place,
everyone is better than you.

363
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:28,750
It has been proven by an infallible formula.

364
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,588
Tahani might be a little British
and condescending at times

365
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:37,592
but she devoted her entire life
to helping other people.

366
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:41,513
I mean when you were with her today,
did she do anything to indicate

367
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:43,557
that she might be secretly out to get you?

368
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:46,268
No. Because I was there
to thwart her plan.

369
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,605
Or because the only plan
was to comfort people.

370
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,066
She's a good person. Accept that.

371
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:59,865
Hey, babe. Great news.
I got us tickets to the Coyotes' game.

372
00:17:00,116 --> 00:17:02,576
Awesome!
- But, ooh, yikes.

373
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:04,870
Turns out two of the players
have "DUI's.

374
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,289
Guess we can't cheer for that team.

375
00:17:07,331 --> 00:17:08,206
Eleanor...

376
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:12,752
You know what? Instead, let's just stay in,
watch a Roman Polanski movie

377
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:15,213
listen to R. Kelly, and eat Chik-Fil-A.

378
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,090
Does that sound good?

379
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:19,342
There's bad stuff everywhere, man.

380
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:21,094
It's impossible to avoid.

381
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,221
Yeah, but... shouldn't we just try?

382
00:17:23,264 --> 00:17:25,682
Shouldn't we just try to do
the right thing, whenever we can?

383
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:29,102
Why? It's so much harder to live like that,
and it's not like someone's keeping score.

384
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:31,813
Look, I know you're gonna break up with me.

385
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:33,148
Okay? I'm not an idiot.

386
00:17:33,191 --> 00:17:34,649
I read your emails to your dad.

387
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:35,650
Oh, my God.
- Have fun being

388
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,194
so amazing and perfect until you die.

389
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:40,363
And by the way, I'm talking really fast
because I still go to Andy's Coffee

390
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:41,823
and I got a full punch card, bro!

391
00:17:49,332 --> 00:17:50,874
Good people make me insecure.

392
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,085
When I'm around someone
who I think is "better" than me

393
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:55,712
I try and drag them down to my level.

394
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:59,508
That's why perfect Tahani
is like my kryptonite.

395
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,302
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe Tahani

396
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:05,555
has her own set of insecurities
and anxieties?

397
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:06,723
Never.

398
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,059
That woman has zero problems.

399
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:12,103
Her biggest flaw is
that she makes a weird face

400
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:15,774
when she sneezes and even that is
actually charming

401
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:17,484
because she looks like a baby deer.

402
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:20,987
The point is... you were right.

403
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,407
About why I reacted to her the way I did.

404
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,619
Well, maybe even admitting
that is an important step.

405
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:29,955
And also, maybe don't listen to me.

406
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:31,706
I would love not to listen to you.

407
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,832
Wait, what?

408
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:38,713
Basically, my life's work
is thirty-six hundred pages of garbage.

409
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:40,715
Even, Michael couldn't understand it.

410
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,801
So? What does Michael know?

411
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:43,718
Everything.

412
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:47,264
That's my point - he knows everything,
and it was too convoluted even for him.

413
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,683
Michael does not know everything.

414
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,561
Michael does not know
I'm not supposed to be here.

415
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:54,938
You wrote four thousand pages

416
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:58,108
on one of the most
complicated subjects in the world!

417
00:18:58,234 --> 00:19:00,986
I mean I used to get bored
halfway through writing a text message.

418
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:02,612
Be proud!

419
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:11,371
I want to broaden my horizons
and try new things and I will.

420
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,707
But even though I might
have gotten lost in the weeds

421
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:18,336
I loved writing this book,
and I want to try again.

422
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:19,588
So...

423
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:22,424
will you be my advisor?
- Chidi

424
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:25,051
all I want is for you to be happy.

425
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,181
So if spending eternity
getting blunt feedback on your circular

426
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:35,312
rambling ideas will make you happy,
then of course I will be your advisor!

427
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:39,065
Let's throw that monstrosity
in the trash and start over!

428
00:19:40,818 --> 00:19:42,444
Aren't there maybe some parts
worth salvaging?

429
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:45,447
Honestly, man, I don't even know.
I mean that thing is unreadable.

430
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:49,326
I literally learned what headaches were
because that thing gave me a headache.

431
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:50,827
Okay.

432
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:55,040
There you go!
New beginnings! Well done.

433
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:19,898
Oh! Hello, Eleanor.

434
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,359
Hi. Sorry, I was just cleaning up.

435
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:24,361
You okay?

436
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:28,073
Do you want to talk about it?

437
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,115
Desperately.

438
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:31,326
It's Jianyu.

439
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:33,536
I just can't seem to connect with him.

440
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:35,288
I know that he took a vow of silence

441
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,041
but he won't even talk to me,
his soulmate!

442
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,418
And I adore talking.

443
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,462
I know. You do.

444
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:44,798
Eleanor, you don't know
what it's like to be in paradise

445
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,258
and feel like there's something
just not quite right.

446
00:20:47,968 --> 00:20:49,260
Well...

447
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:54,057
I may not know exactly
what you're feeling, but I do understand.

448
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:57,519
And you deserve to be happy,
because...

449
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:01,898
you are an impressive, thoughtful,
and special person.

450
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,360
Not to mention...

451
00:21:06,946 --> 00:21:08,947
you have a rockin' bod.

452
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:12,867
I mean, Jianyu may be mute,
but he's not blind.

453
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:17,706
You two belong here,
and you belong together.

454
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:19,958
And, you have all of eternity

455
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,335
so there's plenty of time
for things to change.

456
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:25,839
Oh, thank you.
I really needed to hear that.

457
00:21:25,881 --> 00:21:26,756
Come here.

458
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:30,844
Ugh! Of course your hugs
are amazing.

459
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:42,313
Stupid ledge. No stairs.

460
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:44,524
Hmm!

461
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,901
Everyone here is really into hugging.

462
00:21:48,863 --> 00:21:50,739
Looks like someone learned something.

463
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:58,788
Well... it's 'cause someone else
is a really good teacher.

464
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,585
Eleanor! Hello.

465
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:06,004
How are you, my dear, sweet "bestie?"

466
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,173
Never better. What's up?

467
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:10,550
Well, Janet has been acting
as my assistant.

468
00:22:10,593 --> 00:22:14,804
It... it's not what she was
designed to do. It didn't go "great."

469
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:16,181
But now I'm back to normal.

470
00:22:16,432 --> 00:22:18,183
It turns out that the best Janet

471
00:22:18,225 --> 00:22:21,102
was the Janet
that was inside Janet all along.

472
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,771
She was feeling a little lost

473
00:22:22,813 --> 00:22:26,441
so I gave her a self-help book
to restore her confidence.

474
00:22:26,692 --> 00:22:29,402
Now I'm living my truth
and creating my bliss.

475
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:31,654
Yes. But anyway, um... look

476
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:34,240
Michael asked me
if I would serve as his assistant

477
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:37,243
but I'd quite like to focus
on my relationship with Jianyu.

478
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:40,872
So, I recommended you for the job.

479
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:45,251
Eleanor, you and I could work side by side

480
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:48,087
to figure out what's going wrong
with this neighbourhood.

481
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,255
Will you help me?

482
00:22:50,216 --> 00:22:51,424
How could I say no?

483
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,134
Hurrah! Hurrah!
- Hurrah!

484
00:22:57,348 --> 00:22:58,306
What now?

485
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:11,694
Relax, Eleanor.
You sent this to yourself.

486
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:15,573
This is your own guilt,
manifesting itself.

487
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:18,409
I've been waiting for you.

488
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,038
Jianyu? You talk now?

489
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:27,085
You sent me
these threatening notes?

490
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:28,419
What the fork, man?

491
00:23:28,462 --> 00:23:29,879
Some Buddhist monk you are!

492
00:23:30,214 --> 00:23:32,340
You don't belong here. Admit it.

493
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:37,512
Okay, you're right. I don't belong here.

494
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,806
Michael made a mistake.
But I'm trying, dude.

495
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:43,977
I'm really trying to be a good person,
and I think I'm changing, for the better.

496
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:46,604
So just please, please don't rat me out.

497
00:23:47,857 --> 00:23:50,400
Don't worry. I won't.

498
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:52,360
Because I'm not supposed
to be here either!

499
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:55,280
I don't know how I got here,
I have no idea what's going on

500
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:56,781
and I'm freaking out, homey!

501
00:23:57,074 --> 00:23:59,200
You gotta help me! I'm scared!

502
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:02,412
What?
