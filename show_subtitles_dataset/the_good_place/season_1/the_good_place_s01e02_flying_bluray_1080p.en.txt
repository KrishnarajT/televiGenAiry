1
00:00:02,108 --> 00:00:04,693
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

2
00:00:04,986 --> 00:00:05,860
Cool!

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,613
Eleanor, you are my soulmate.

4
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:10,532
There's been a big mistake...

5
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:13,451
I'm not supposed to be here.

6
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:14,452
Wait, what?

7
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,871
These people might be "good"

8
00:00:16,956 --> 00:00:19,124
but are they really
that much better than me?

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,255
Eleanor,
this is all happening because of you!

10
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:28,174
Give me a chance.
Let me earn my place here.

11
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,135
Let me be your ethical guinea pig.

12
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:32,387
My soul is in your hands, soulmate.

13
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:37,225
I, uh... I don't know what to do here.

14
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:39,561
This is a mess - morally speaking.

15
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:43,773
This is a putrid,
disgusting bowl of ethical soup.

16
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:46,317
Okay, well, how about we just chill

17
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:50,071
and go to the town meeting
and talk it out after.

18
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:51,406
Wha-
- Great! Hey

19
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,450
how do I make
that helper woman show up?

20
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,077
Hello... front desk lady...

21
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:58,997
magical slave robot?
- Excuse me, Janet?

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,665
Hi, there.

23
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,585
Still not used to it.
Um, Janet, I need...

24
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:07,922
quick question - can anyone
access our search history

25
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:10,675
or is this an incognito browsing situation

26
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:12,886
like when you're stalking
a hot mailman from your work computer?

27
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:14,888
It is one hundred percent confidential.

28
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,016
No one can access what you ask me,
including Michael.

29
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:20,643
Now, what kind of pornography
would you like to see?

30
00:01:20,686 --> 00:01:22,062
No, no, no, no, not porn...

31
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:25,940
I, um, I need clothes - like yours
and Chidi's with the stripes.

32
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:27,358
There you go.

33
00:01:29,904 --> 00:01:32,447
Everybody,
everybody, gather round, please.

34
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,490
Thank you. Thank you.

35
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:36,951
Obviously, there's something
very wrong with this neighbourhood.

36
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:41,790
We don't know what it is,
how long it will last, or what caused it.

37
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,208
What do we know, Janet?

38
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,835
We know where it happened - here.

39
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:47,087
Yes, thank you, Janet.

40
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:48,505
The chaos happened here.

41
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:51,382
See, that's the trouble
with these perfect systems -

42
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:53,051
one little flaw can lead to...

43
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:57,347
well, it can lead to Gary over there.

44
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,474
Hey, Gary.

45
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:00,767
Hang in there, buddy.

46
00:02:02,144 --> 00:02:03,478
My armpits are leaking.

47
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:05,396
What is that called again?
- Sweat.

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,732
Right, right, still not used to being
in a human body.

49
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:09,150
And what do you do with sweat?

50
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:10,276
Do... do you lick it away?
Is that right?

51
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,571
Nope, you dab it with a cloth.
- Oh, right.

52
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,032
And then you lick the cloth?

53
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:17,492
That seems weirder.

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,246
Michael, look.

55
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,289
Okay, that's a good sign.

56
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:25,583
It... it... it could mean
that this is almost over.

57
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,669
Oh, such relief.

58
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:31,297
That was my first time as a fashion "don't"
and I did not care for it.

59
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:42,183
Okay, things are settling down outside

60
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:46,980
I think it's time to make me good, partner.

61
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:48,148
How do we do it?

62
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,942
Is there a pill I can take
or something I could vape?

63
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,944
Where did you get a chalkboard?

64
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:56,239
It's The Good Place, you can get
anything you want at any time.

65
00:02:56,282 --> 00:02:57,657
And you chose a chalkboard?

66
00:02:58,492 --> 00:02:59,367
What are you reading?

67
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:02,579
The Metaphysics of Morals
by Immanuel Kant.

68
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,998
It's a treatise
on the aesthetic preconditions

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,583
of the mind's receptivity to duty.

70
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:09,294
It's a book on how to act good.

71
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:11,796
Oh, great!
So you've decided to help me?

72
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:14,674
I don't know.
There's a thousand questions.

73
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:17,302
Is there a moral imperative to help you?

74
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,221
Do I have a greater obligation
to my community?

75
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:23,183
Are you taking someone else's spot -
someone who deserves to be here?

76
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:24,392
Ooh! On that question

77
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:28,021
I honestly think
I was just put here by mistake

78
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:30,565
because Michael called me
Eleanor Shellstrop

79
00:03:30,608 --> 00:03:32,233
so he knows I'm me -

80
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:36,404
he... he's just wrong
about my overall quality level.

81
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,200
Please help me, man.
I swear I am worth it.

82
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,036
Tell me one fact
that you know about me.

83
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:46,539
We spent the whole day together.
You must remember something.

84
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,042
What country am I from?

85
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:51,878
Is it racist if I say, "Africa?"

86
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:55,673
Yes, and Africa is not a country.
I am from Senegal.

87
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:58,760
Do I have any siblings?
Where did I go to college?

88
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:01,429
Trick question - you didn't.

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,557
I was literally a college professor.

90
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,310
Do you not remember
one single thing about me?

91
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:09,646
Dude, things have been nuts around here.

92
00:04:09,688 --> 00:04:11,397
I bet you don't know anything about me!

93
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,900
You were born in Phoenix.
You went to school in Tempe.

94
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:14,817
You're an only child.

95
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,612
Your favourite show is something called,
The Real Housewives of Atlanta.

96
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:22,158
And your favourite book is
Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.

97
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:24,577
How did you know all that?

98
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,790
Because you are constantly
talking about yourself.

99
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:32,043
You are the most self-obsessed person
I have ever met.

100
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:34,837
You should see
Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,547
See, this is my fear about you, Eleanor -

102
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,968
you are too selfish to ever be a good person.

103
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,971
Well, I think you're wrong.
- What country am I from again?

104
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:46,140
"Sen... sodyne"

105
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:47,809
That is a brand of toothpaste.

106
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,311
Look, the only thing
that you are concerned with

107
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:51,938
is your own happiness.

108
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:54,315
That's your problem.

109
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:03,032
Okay, names in the hat -
time to pick a designated driver.

110
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:04,659
And the loser is...

111
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,078
Betsy.

112
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:08,830
Wait, you never get picked

113
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,748
and you're always the one
who draws the name.

114
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,166
Let me see that.
- There's no need.

115
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:15,461
Everyone here believes in my integrity,
one hundred percent. Right, guys?

116
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:17,505
Give it to me.

117
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:19,716
For the record

118
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:23,761
I did that out of principle
because it absolutely had your name on it.

119
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:27,473
If I check the other ones I can figure it out
by process of elimination.

120
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,855
Again, out of principle

121
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:35,523
better watch over you, Betsy.

122
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,483
This is what integrity looks like.

123
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,488
All right, everyone, let's get started.

124
00:05:42,823 --> 00:05:44,240
Things have settled down.

125
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:45,366
Whoo!

126
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,243
So, hopefully, we're off and running.

127
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:50,371
Welcome to orientation, day two.

128
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:52,582
Now, today we're going to start
with something

129
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:54,834
that everyone has always wanted to do...

130
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:56,627
flying.

131
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,883
Now that you're dead,
let's live a little, right?

132
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:06,179
Uh, sorry... uh, Michael, if I might -

133
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:09,474
I was just thinking... earlier today
in all of the chaos

134
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:12,393
large swaths of this neighbourhood
were destroyed.

135
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:14,520
We thought perhaps
some of us could... uh...

136
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:16,522
volunteer to help clean up
the debris, you know

137
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:19,650
it's quite a fun way to band together
as a community.

138
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:20,735
Isn't that right, Jianyu?

139
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:24,197
Oh, uh, yes, sorry,
for those of you don't know -

140
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,366
my soulmate Jianyu here
is a Buddhist monk.

141
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:29,077
He took a vow of silence
that he's still observing -

142
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,412
even here, in The Good Place.

143
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:33,664
It's truly inspiring.

144
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:36,542
Well, Tahani,
it's not really your job to clean up

145
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:39,545
but I suppose there's no harm
if you really want to.

146
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:40,963
Oh, well, "Hurrah!"

147
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,299
We need about, uh, twelve volunteers.

148
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,968
Oh!
- I can't believe all these people

149
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:48,930
are passing on flying
to pick up garbage all day.

150
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:51,182
Have fun, nerds.

151
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,394
I'll be soaring through the air
like a forking bird.

152
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:58,314
Eleanor and I would love to help.
- Oh, "Hurrah, hurrah!". Yay!

153
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,691
Dude?
- You want to prove you're not selfish?

154
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,110
Here's the perfect test -

155
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:05,029
there's something fun that you want to do
and then there's something less fun

156
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:06,781
that people are doing
for the common good.

157
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,990
Which do you choose?

158
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,035
Have fun.

159
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:13,538
Whoo!

160
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,460
Yay! Yeah! All right!

161
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:21,712
Wee!

162
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:26,634
Hey, up there - having fun
or does it maybe suck, probably?

163
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,344
Well, I wouldn't call it fun...

164
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:32,723
I'd say it's like it's like fifty million
simultaneous orgasms, but better.

165
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:34,725
How's volunteer garbage pickup?

166
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,855
About the same.
- Great. Wee!

167
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:44,735
You know, this really reminds me
of my time in Vietnam

168
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:47,947
picking up mortar shells
with my Godmother, Diana.

169
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,032
Doesn't really matter
what she's a princess of.

170
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:50,950
It's not really important.

171
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:52,869
Tahani, how goes the cleaning?

172
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,662
Oh, swimmingly, Michael.

173
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:59,125
And I have to say, this neighbourhood
that you built is truly a masterpiece

174
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:00,668
the likes of which I've never seen

175
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:03,171
and I've been to Johnny Depp's
private bird sanctuary.

176
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:05,006
Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

177
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:08,259
But it's also dead wrong.

178
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:10,720
This neighbourhood is a disaster.

179
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:14,974
See, I must have made a mistake somewhere
and it led to all this chaos

180
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:17,643
and now I'm just... I'm just terrified
that it's going to happen again.

181
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,770
I'm trying to put a good face on...

182
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:23,316
well, this face
that I've constructed for myself

183
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:27,069
but the truth is, I'm just miserable.

184
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,197
I have to go.

185
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,199
Thank you so much for your service.

186
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:35,286
Oh, no... powerful people
do not handle failure well.

187
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:37,580
Michael could be heading
for a total meltdown.

188
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,335
Soulmate, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

189
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:43,836
Should we say it at the same time?

190
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:47,924
All right, one, two, three -
we must help Michael.

191
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,593
Oh, you sly devil

192
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:52,595
you're going
to keep me on my toes, aren't you?

193
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:54,555
All right, come on, let's go.

194
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,352
Oh, boy!
- Hey, Gunnar. Hey, Antonio.

195
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:01,020
Hey, Eleanor, isn't this great?

196
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:03,731
Uh, yeah - when I thought of the afterlife

197
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:08,069
I totally pictured being an unpaid,
nonflying janitor.

198
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:09,612
Us, too.

199
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,906
You guys are so fun -

200
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,325
just relentlessly fun.
I keep thinking -

201
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:16,118
when are they going to stop being fun?

202
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:17,703
And the answer is, never.

203
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:20,498
You're never going to stop.

204
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,878
Well, I have had a pretty full day
of being unselfish.

205
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:29,423
I've made some new friends,
my area is almost garbage free

206
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:32,593
so you're going to help me
figure out how to stay, right?

207
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,428
Oh, that is a really tough question.

208
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:38,140
Most great philosophers would say
helping you is pointless -

209
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:39,559
that you can't try to be good

210
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:42,103
especially when your motivations
are so obviously corrupt.

211
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:45,106
Yeah, but what do
most great philosophers know?

212
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:47,233
On the other hand,
Aristotle thought that moral virtue

213
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,943
is something
that you could get better at.

214
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:51,112
He... he compared it
to playing the flute -

215
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:52,863
the more you practice,
the more you improve.

216
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:55,032
Aristotle
- that's my boy right there!

217
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:58,452
He was the best. I mean,
most people agree he was the best one.

218
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:03,416
So it sounds to me like you are
on board the "help Eleanor train."

219
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,419
Well, I've narrowed it down
to two possibilities - yes and no.

220
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:10,590
Well, no worries - just hit me up

221
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:13,134
when you're done
weighing my life in your hands.

222
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:17,221
I'll just keep doing what I do best -
being super-considerate and selfless.

223
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,143
Hey, guys.
- Okay, Eleanor, reminder -

224
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:24,145
we switched to a rotating system

225
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:27,231
for choosing a designated driver
and it's your turn.

226
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,274
Got it.

227
00:10:28,734 --> 00:10:31,652
Full disclosure - I forgot
we were doing this new system.

228
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:32,945
I got off work early.

229
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:36,365
I've been here for about an hour
and I'm already pretty drunk.

230
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:39,368
Someone else will do it.
- Good call.

231
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:42,538
I guess the only place I'll be driving
is through the giant loophole

232
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:45,374
in the system I accidentally discovered.

233
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:47,710
Beep, beep!

234
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:50,588
Whoo!

235
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:54,342
Whoo!

236
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:57,303
I can't believe they managed
to mix one million flavours together

237
00:10:57,346 --> 00:11:00,097
and yet, somehow I can taste
each individual one.

238
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,265
It's remarkable.

239
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:02,933
I got no flavour.

240
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:05,853
It's all I deserve really.
- No.

241
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:08,189
Look, I... I appreciate
you trying to cheer me up

242
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:10,232
I really do,
but you don't understand -

243
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:13,778
this was the very first neighbourhood
that I got to design.

244
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:17,114
It was my chance to prove myself
and now I've blown it.

245
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:20,326
You know, sometimes a flaw
can make something even more beautiful -

246
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:22,370
like with Cindy Crawford
and how short she is.

247
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:26,123
Oh, Tahani, if I made
one tiny mistake in my design

248
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,334
if there's a single glitch
in the system

249
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,838
if even one blade of grass
is angled a fraction of a degree off...

250
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:39,345
the whole neighbourhood is...
compromised.

251
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:43,641
Whose dog is that?
Guys, whose dog is that?

252
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:45,976
Whose dog is that!

253
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:50,022
See, this is one of those glitches
I was talking about.

254
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:52,024
Nice try, puppy.

255
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:02,827
Whoo!

256
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:03,953
That was a close one.

257
00:12:04,454 --> 00:12:05,329
Teacup?

258
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,166
Hey, have you seen my dog?

259
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:19,135
Shouldn't these be magical trash bags?

260
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,221
Five more minutes,
flyers, five more minutes.

261
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:23,681
Oh, man, really?

262
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,693
Janet, I'm finished with clean up
and I'm ready to fly.

263
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,486
How do I start?
- Hop on the launch pad

264
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,197
and conjure
an image that brings you pure joy.

265
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:43,409
Some people think of their wedding
day or favourite vacation spot.

266
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:46,162
People puking on rollercoasters.

267
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:49,206
People puking on rollercoasters.

268
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:51,584
It's working!

269
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,003
Ow! What the fork?

270
00:12:57,507 --> 00:13:01,469
Janet, any chance this is
a scheduled trash storm?

271
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:05,097
So, here's the situation, Pevita -

272
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,350
I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.

273
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,561
But, I got her back.

274
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:13,272
Everything... everything seems fine.

275
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:16,066
Teacup, thank goodness you're okay.

276
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:19,403
Everyone, it is merely
a construct of a dog.

277
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:22,406
It feels no pain or joy or love.

278
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:24,241
Teacup doesn't love me?

279
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:29,121
Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
it definitely feels love.

280
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:31,832
Do you actually want a dog
that loves you a little bit more?

281
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,542
Because I can kick her
right back into the sun

282
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:34,794
and get you another one, just like that.

283
00:13:34,836 --> 00:13:37,505
No!
- Oh, boy, I'm making things worse.

284
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:40,257
Okay. All right... that's all right,
breathe, breathe... you breathe?

285
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,092
Mm-hmm.
- If you do, then just breathe

286
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:44,512
because everything is fine,
Michael, it's fine.

287
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:45,429
Whoo!

288
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:48,557
It's raining garbage.

289
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,475
Run!

290
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:52,478
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'll run this way.

291
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:00,653
Chidi, hey

292
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:01,821
before you say anything...

293
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,616
that's it.
I just don't want you to say anything.

294
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,451
What did you do?
- Nothing.

295
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:11,872
It just started raining trash
out of nowhere for no reason at all.

296
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,998
Ah!

297
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,503
Okay, fine, fine - my bag broke
and I ditched the trash

298
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,129
instead of taking it all the way
to the dumpster.

299
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:22,633
But, in my defence
there were only five minutes left

300
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,510
in flying and I wanted to go flying.

301
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:27,179
How is that a defence?
You made a bad choice.

302
00:14:27,222 --> 00:14:28,389
I made a bad choice?

303
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,766
We could have literally been flying

304
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:33,018
and all you wanted to do
was talk about morals.

305
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,604
I mean, you're like
the worst part of Superman.

306
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:38,399
This is a relief.
I can stop my deliberations.

307
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:41,443
You are a selfish person
and it is pointless to help you.

308
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,404
- You are on your own.
- Oh, man.

309
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:48,242
How about this trash storm, Gunnar?
- More cleaning up to do.

310
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:49,952
It's a... it's a dream come true.

311
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,584
Whew.
- We're okay.

312
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,377
You can't die here.

313
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:01,922
Come on, I mean even you have
to admit - those guys are psycho.

314
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:06,969
I don't know
what's happening to me.

315
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:11,891
I mean, it's my duty to be calm
and in control and I'm falling apart.

316
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:15,185
No, Michael,
you are a paragon of fortitude.

317
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:16,937
You're a mountain of strength.

318
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,732
I'm not a mountain of strength.

319
00:15:20,483 --> 00:15:21,650
I'm a canyon

320
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:25,070
full of poo-poo.

321
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:28,949
Jianyu, the architect of this neighbourhood
has just referred to himself

322
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:31,327
as a canyon full of poo-poo.

323
00:15:31,578 --> 00:15:33,662
Surely now
you will say something.

324
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,164
Grace us
with your vocalised wisdom.

325
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:36,749
Please, I'm begging you.

326
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:51,055
Oh...

327
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:56,560
Yes, yes I understand.

328
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:58,729
The strength is inside me.

329
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:00,689
It's been there all along.

330
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,859
No, of course.
I can overcome any obstacle.

331
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,612
Oh, thank you, Jianyu,
thank you.

332
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,742
I'm back.

333
00:16:15,455 --> 00:16:16,330
You did it!

334
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,166
Oh, you have so much to teach me.

335
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,293
Maybe I should try
to be silent, too.

336
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:23,754
No really... look, here I go.

337
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,425
Oh! That was wonderful.

338
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:29,593
So cleansing.

339
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:40,354
Just water tonight, huh?

340
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:43,649
Designated driver?
- Yeah, it sucks.

341
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,110
I think it's awesome.
I mean, someone's got to do it, right?

342
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:48,195
I think it's a cool thing
to do for people.

343
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,781
Yeah, no, no, I meant...

344
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:54,827
I meant I... it sucks that I can't
do it more often.

345
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:57,037
You know,
I actually prefer it to drinking...

346
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:00,666
staying sober, knowing my friends
will get home safe -

347
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:02,835
that's my buzz.

348
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:08,590
Hey guys, good news and bad news -

349
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,801
see that hot bartender over there?

350
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:13,053
He's into me
and we're gonna bang it out.

351
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,597
The bad news is it means
I can't drive you guys home.

352
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:18,642
But, I did call a cab for you guys

353
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:21,395
but they recognised my number
and they didn't want to come.

354
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:23,355
I've thrown up in a lot of cabs.

355
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:25,399
So, are we good here?

356
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:28,944
Eleanor, you have
a very important choice to make -

357
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:33,991
if you blow us off, you are banned
from Thursday night drinks forever.

358
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,413
Yeah, I'm good with that.
I'll see you guys at work.

359
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:40,414
Peace!

360
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:41,790
You - let's go.

361
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,598
Hey, how did you know
I was here?

362
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,224
I saw you from my window.

363
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:03,145
That's where I live, by the way...
not that you ever asked.

364
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:05,481
What are you doing?

365
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:10,819
I went to all the places
where I dumped trash earlier

366
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:13,363
and cleaned it up
so it couldn't be traced back to me.

367
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,700
Well, it looks like
you cleaned up everything.

368
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:19,745
You're doing this
because you feel bad

369
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:22,498
and you're not even doing it
to get me to help you anymore

370
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,500
because I told you,
that's not gonna happen.

371
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:28,295
Okay, yeah, fine,
I felt bad for stupid Gunnar

372
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:31,131
and stupider Antonio
and the whole neighbourhood.

373
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:32,716
I felt bad about what I did.

374
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:36,136
It was a weird feeling...
not used to it... didn't love it.

375
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:39,890
Well, feeling remorse
about being wrong isn't as good

376
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,434
as just doing something right,
but it's a start.

377
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,479
Look, I think you're capable of change

378
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:48,899
and I will help you try.

379
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:52,319
Oh, wow, man -
I swear I won't let you down.

380
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:55,405
Hi, there. I've collected
the worst smelling garbage that I could find.

381
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:58,242
Do you still want me
to dump it inside of Antonio's house?

382
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,744
What?

383
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:03,413
No, I did not tell you to do that.

384
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:05,165
You are loco girlfriend.

385
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,334
Okay, I won't let you down
starting now.

386
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:16,426
Ah, Eleanor, good morning.

387
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:19,054
Michael, do you know
what the best part about this place is -

388
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:21,014
you figured out
how to make a to-go cup

389
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,767
that doesn't leak
right where the seam meets the lid.

390
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,602
Oh, I'm so glad you noticed.

391
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:26,770
I was very proud of that.

392
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:28,647
One of the hardest problems
I had to solve.

393
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,317
Eleanor, I know what you did...

394
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:36,280
cleaning up the entire neighbourhood
by yourself.

395
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:40,325
I knew you were special
but this is proof.

396
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,995
Well, I was just doing my part,
you know.

397
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:46,290
And... since I'm special -
your words -

398
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,250
I didn't get to fly...

399
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:51,587
I'm sorry. Now I had to ban flying
for a thousand years

400
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:52,713
too many injuries.

401
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:57,759
One resident hit a rotting turkey carcass
at a thousand miles an hour.

402
00:19:57,844 --> 00:20:03,807
It just exploded into this fireball
of turkey flesh and bones and sinew.

403
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:09,813
Anyway, enjoy your coffee...
and the cup.

404
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:17,362
So, I have moved out of my apartment
officially and into your guestroom

405
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:20,199
figured it'd cause less suspicion
and make things easier

406
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:21,408
for our "Good Person Lessons."

407
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:24,536
Cool. Uh, just FYI, I'm a very loud snorer

408
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:28,248
and I like to drip-dry in the nude,
so eyes to yourself, perv.

409
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,374
Okay. Fine.

410
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,544
Now, you got a long way to go
to pull this off.

411
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:36,006
It will take hours and hours
of studying ethics

412
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:37,174
and moral philosophy.

413
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:41,803
We're going to have assignments
and quizzes and papers.

414
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:43,847
It's going to be so much fun.

415
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:45,891
Remind me
what I'm getting out of this again?

416
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:48,018
You get to avoid eternal damnation.

417
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:49,519
Oh, yeah, right.

418
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,980
Hey, I got you a present.

419
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,316
What?
- Senegal.

420
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:57,236
That's not a present.
That's just common decency.

421
00:20:57,278 --> 00:20:59,112
Yeah, but I forking nailed it.

422
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:01,281
Good talk.

423
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,219
Aw, shirt!
