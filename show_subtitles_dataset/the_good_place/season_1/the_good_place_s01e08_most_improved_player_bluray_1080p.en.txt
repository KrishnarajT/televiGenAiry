1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:09,459
Eleanor? Come on in.

2
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:14,964
Well, not often you get to confront
your greatest failure face to face.

3
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,424
Good to see you too, bud.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,759
I am just dumbfounded
as to how this happened.

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,430
Our system has never made
a mistake before.

6
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:23,514
It's just not possible.

7
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:25,057
And yet, here we are.

8
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:27,351
First things first.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,106
Who are you?
- Well, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,108
And some of the info you had
was right.

11
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:37,278
I mean, "flattened by a boner pill truck

12
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,364
after dropping margarita mix
in grocery store parking lot"

13
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:41,866
that's a very "me" way to die.

14
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:44,410
But all the other info was wrong.

15
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:47,955
In my defence,
when I first arrived and you said

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,625
"You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead,
and you're in the Good Place"

17
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:53,711
I had no reason to think
that was a mistake.

18
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:58,049
Location and date of birth, please?

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,427
Phoenix, Arizona. October 14th, 1986.

20
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:05,515
So, sorry, that's what I used to tell
people when I lied about my age.

21
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:09,018
I was born in 1982.

22
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:11,729
You lied so much you forgot
your own birthdate.

23
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:13,731
Not a great start.

24
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,068
But it should be enough
for Janet to locate your file.

25
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:18,778
Janet?

26
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:23,491
Janet?
- What's that? What's that?

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,076
What's this?

28
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:28,996
Her memory's still being rebooted because

29
00:01:29,414 --> 00:01:30,831
oh, you know
someone murdered her.

30
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:35,002
Janet, could you please locate
the file for an Eleanor Shellstrop

31
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:38,047
born in 1982.
- Yes.

32
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:40,216
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

33
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:42,301
Sure! Anything else?

34
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:45,763
No, Janet, this is actually a cactus.

35
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,851
- This might take a while.
- Wee!

36
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:07,243
Since Janet can't retrieve your file,
I need to find another way

37
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:09,453
to determine
what kind of person you were.

38
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,665
This is a quick litmus test.

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,417
A handful of questions

40
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:17,878
designed to tell whether you were
fundamentally good or bad.

41
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:19,338
Question number one.

42
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:22,341
Did you ever wrongfully slaughter
your kinsman's yak?

43
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:28,180
Oh, sorry. This is the nomadic
Mongolian edition.

44
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,934
I need to grab the North American.

45
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,227
Yep, here we go.

46
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,857
Question number one.
Did you ever commit a serious crime

47
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,526
such as murder, sexual harassment

48
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:43,070
arson, or otherwise?
- No.

49
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:50,244
Did you ever have a vanity license plate
like "Mama's BMW,"Lexus4Liz"

50
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:52,413
or "Boobguy?"
- No.

51
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:55,041
Did you ever reheat fish
in an office microwave?

52
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,376
Ew... No.
- Have you ever paid money

53
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,254
to hear music performed by California
funk rock band

54
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,631
"The Red Hot Chili Peppers?"

55
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,175
No.
- Where you ever a waiter

56
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:08,429
and when seeing a customer
who had eaten all his or her food

57
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,974
you said sarcastically,
"I guess you hated it?"

58
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,852
No.
- Michael: Have you ever used the word hubby?

59
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:18,272
Or referred to the department store
Target as "Tarjay"?

60
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:19,398
No.

61
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,903
Did you ever take off your shoes
and socks on a commercial airline?

62
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,697
And socks? Ew. Who would do that?

63
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,243
People who go to the Bad Place,
Eleanor, that's the point.

64
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,414
The Bad Place is every bit
as awful as the Good Place is good.

65
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,668
And unless I can figure out
a compelling reason to keep you here

66
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,711
you will spend eternity

67
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:44,840
with murderers and arsonists,
and people who take off their shoes

68
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,551
and socks on commercial airlines.

69
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,472
Janet, can I have a glass
of water, please?

70
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,891
Here you go!

71
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:56,477
Oh, gosh! You said "water"?

72
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,313
Yeah.
- I'm so sorry. There you go.

73
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,238
I really do have sympathy
for your situation.

74
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:10,032
I mean, you thought your soulmate
was a good person

75
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,451
and then you learned
that she's just an immoral grifter.

76
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:16,414
Tahani, please.
- Am I wrong? She lied to everyone.

77
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:19,625
She caused a giant sinkhole,
into which poor Glenn fell.

78
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,419
She caused a trash storm. She...

79
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:24,004
Well, she pretended to be my friend

80
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:25,881
when I really needed one.

81
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:29,343
And lest we forget, she murdered Janet!

82
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,929
As far as I'm concerned,
the sooner she's gone

83
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,222
the better off we'll all be.

84
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,808
I... I understand that Eleanor
violated our trust.

85
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:37,226
But please

86
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:38,394
when you're talking to Michael

87
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,813
try to think about
what she's had to go through.

88
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:45,818
All right. I will, for you.

89
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,237
But we've been through
a lot as well.

90
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,406
You know, I haven't been
this upset since my good friend Taylor

91
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,199
was rudely upstaged
by my other friend Kanye

92
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:54,410
who was defending
my best friend BeyoncÃ©.

93
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:58,122
And finally, a multi-part question.

94
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,208
Did you ever appear on
the American television programme

95
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:03,627
"The Bachelor,"
or its companion shows

96
00:05:03,754 --> 00:05:06,213
"The Bachelorette"
and "Bachelor in Paradise"

97
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,632
or work on them in any capacity

98
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:13,053
or post on any social media site
that you were

99
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:17,349
emotionally invested in
any of the "relationships"

100
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:19,810
the contestants were pursuing?
- No.

101
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,274
OK! You did very well
on the questionnaire, Eleanor.

102
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,442
So far, so good.

103
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,402
Michael? Good news.

104
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:30,946
I was able to obtain
Eleanor Shellstrop's file.

105
00:05:31,323 --> 00:05:33,407
Would you like to see it?
- Yes, Janet, I would.

106
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:35,576
But, first...

107
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:37,536
Is it actually a cactus?

108
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:38,788
I don't understand.

109
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,540
I want to see the file
for Eleanor Shellstrop.

110
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,460
Is that what you have?
Or do you have a cactus?

111
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:45,836
I have the file.
- You're sure.

112
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:48,881
You have the file, and not a cactus.
- That is correct.

113
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:52,259
I have Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
I do not have a cactus.

114
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:56,055
Excellent. Please give me the file.
- Here you go!

115
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,557
Thank you, Janet.
- You're welcome!

116
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,228
Well, I say we call it a day.

117
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,104
I mean, I nailed the questionnaire

118
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:06,273
and you're swimming in cacti.

119
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,820
Can't we just chalk this up
to a hilarious mistake, and move on?

120
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:12,696
No, we can't, Eleanor.

121
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:15,825
There's no such thing as a mistake,
in this realm.

122
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:18,244
And yet you are, somehow,
a mistake.

123
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,998
I mean you're a giant chunk
of spinach in the teeth of the universe.

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,133
I need to understand every facet
of this disaster.

125
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:35,344
Tell me a lie about yourself.

126
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,806
Any lie.
- I love the opera.

127
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:43,102
And now a truth.
- I love women's MMA.

128
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:45,729
We don't like to use this.

129
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,315
We've never really had a call for it,
before you.

130
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,901
But in the interest of time,
Eleanor...

131
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,445
Did you murder Janet?

132
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,532
No, I did not.

133
00:06:57,742 --> 00:07:00,077
Do you know who did?
- Yes.

134
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,956
Will you tell me who it was?
- No.

135
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:10,212
I assume it was one of your friends,
and I admire you for protecting him or her.

136
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:14,508
But, Eleanor, in the Good Place,
there's no room for bad people

137
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:18,429
or bad actions,
so anyone involved in the murder of Janet

138
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:20,764
will be reviewed and judged.

139
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:23,475
And there will be consequences.

140
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:28,105
Tahani? Come on in.

141
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:29,315
Chidi.

142
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,736
Imposter who soiled
our paradise with her moral turpitude.

143
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,279
What's up?

144
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,364
Thank you for confessing.

145
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:38,324
I don't know what I would
have done

146
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:39,617
if you hadn't.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm amazing.

147
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:42,745
Bad news.
Michael knows I didn't kill Janet

148
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:46,248
which means it's only a matter of time
before he finds out that you did.

149
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,834
And that you did it
because you were trying to stop

150
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,878
Bonehead Jones over here.
- Hey, homies!

151
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:53,088
Then he'll figure out
that Jianyu's also a phony

152
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:56,091
and here's the real dongbuster

153
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,471
Michael said anybody who did anything
bad might have to go...

154
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:03,057
Oh!
- Which means Jianyu's gone

155
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,099
you might be gone

156
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,477
and all three of us are
royally forking forked.

157
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,354
So now I might get sent to the Bad Place?

158
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:11,857
This is terrible!
What am I supposed to do if he asks me?

159
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:14,360
I don't know. Kant would say...

160
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:17,363
that lying in any scenario is wrong

161
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:20,908
so if Michael asks if you killed Janet,
you should say "yes".

162
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,495
On the other hand,
snitches do get stitches.

163
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,246
That is true.
I read that once

164
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,248
on the back of my boy Peanut's tricep.

165
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,376
And you just casually cited
Immanuel Kant.

166
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:32,795
I mean I know we're in a miserable
bind here, but

167
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:34,964
this might be
the proudest day of my life.

168
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,549
No offense,
but that's a real bummer of a life.

169
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:42,304
Tahani. I'll get right to the crux
of the matter.

170
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,349
Did you murder Janet?
- Absolutely not!

171
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,062
Now you've spent a lot of time
with Eleanor.

172
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:51,522
Why do you think that is?

173
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,649
Well, people are just drawn to me.

174
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:57,194
You know, one of my shyest friends,
I won't say his name to preserve his privacy

175
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,405
but he found my presence
so comforting

176
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,616
that he asked me to co-host
his TV show, "Anderson Cooper 360".

177
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:05,661
Given what you learned about Eleanor

178
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,122
do you think she deserves to be here?

179
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,500
Well...

180
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,797
You know if it were up to me,
I might find a way to look past her, um...

181
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,216
deficiencies.

182
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,926
But it's not up to me, is it?

183
00:09:21,136 --> 00:09:23,429
There are some criteria
that she unfortunately just

184
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:24,888
didn't meet in her time on Earth.

185
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,016
So you think that
I should send her to the Bad Place?

186
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,809
Well, I didn't say that.

187
00:09:29,144 --> 00:09:32,855
But is her staying here unfair
to those who earned their place?

188
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:35,065
It sounds like you want her to leave.

189
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:40,904
Well, is it not she who wants us
to leave her?

190
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,324
Thank you, Tahani, you've been a big help.

191
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,494
Listen up, genius.

192
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,079
He's gonna call you in there,
in a second.

193
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:50,539
Don't worry, I got you.

194
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,168
I'll just tell Michael you're the bomb
and that you got a dope soul an hella ethics.

195
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,795
And he'll be all, "thanks, Jianyu".

196
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,173
"You just freaked my being for real".

197
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,759
Oh, boy. No.
Don't say any of that.

198
00:10:02,177 --> 00:10:03,927
Michael has a lie detector in there.

199
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:05,554
It's, uh... it's a glowing cube.

200
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:06,764
Like the All-Spark?

201
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:08,807
From Transformers?
- Sure.

202
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:11,101
Uh, just like the All-Spark,
from Transformers and...

203
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:13,812
and he'll know instantly
if you're lying about anything, so...

204
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:16,607
only "smiles and nods," got it?

205
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,445
Jianyu, come on in.

206
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:34,458
Wise, sage, centered Jianyu.

207
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:38,629
I seek your wisdom
in this moment of crisis.

208
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,008
What to do with Eleanor?
Should I let her stay?

209
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,552
Should I send her away?

210
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:49,765
You think I should send her away?

211
00:10:50,642 --> 00:10:53,310
No, I should let her stay?

212
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:57,981
Or "No, I shouldn't let her stay,
because she doesn't belong here?"

213
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,735
Or, "no, I shouldn't let her stay,
even though she does belong here?"

214
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:06,281
Oh, Jianyu, I wish I had your wisdom.

215
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,661
Your devotion to the noble truths
has given you something that I don't have -

216
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:11,745
clarity.

217
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:13,831
It was Buddha who said

218
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:18,710
"If a man lives a pure life,
nothing can destroy him."

219
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,420
I'm not a man

220
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,172
and I've lived no "life"

221
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,883
so will this destroy me?

222
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:26,176
Ouch!

223
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:31,598
Oh, of course.

224
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:35,477
A cactus on its own intends no harm

225
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,939
it's only when we interfere
that it becomes dangerous.

226
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,400
I need to remember
my own agency here.

227
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:45,195
Oh, thank you, Jianyu.

228
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:46,655
You're free to go.

229
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,701
Oh. Yes, of course, help yourself.

230
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,411
I've got plenty of those.

231
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:57,875
Chidi? Come on in.

232
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,627
Hi there! I have Eleanor's file.

233
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,631
Janet, if you hand me a cactus
I swear I will lose my mind.

234
00:12:06,342 --> 00:12:08,552
Oh! Yes! All right!
Here we go.

235
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,221
Eleanor, come back in.
Chidi, you stay here.

236
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:18,979
This file contains a list
of every good and bad thing you ever did.

237
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:22,774
It's your entire life told through
a compendium of all of your actions.

238
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:25,819
Nope.
It's a picture of a cactus...

239
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:30,324
dozens and dozens and dozens
of pictures of the same cactus.

240
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,328
Oh, no, wait. Here we go.

241
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,663
Well, it's incomplete but...

242
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:41,919
there appear to be some references
to the highest impact events from your life.

243
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,922
That's the, uh... biggest positive
and negative point swings.

244
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:47,716
So, "Little Julie?"
Now who's that?

245
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,176
Julie is my cousin's daughter.

246
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:53,889
Her mom is kind of a mess,
so I used to take her to the mall sometimes

247
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:55,474
and bought her churro dogs.

248
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,353
It's a hot dog,
but the bun is two churros

249
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:02,439
and it's tied together
with a Slim Jim.

250
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,901
It's an Arizona delicacy.
- Oh, sounds awful

251
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,445
but it's very nice
that you made that girl happy.

252
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:10,948
So. What's this?

253
00:13:11,032 --> 00:13:12,074
Cool Thredz

254
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,577
Glendale Arizona's
Premiere T-shirt Emporium?"

255
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,580
Uh... can we skip around and...
and circle back?

256
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,499
How about I tell you more
about those churro dogs?

257
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,211
They came with unlimited ranch dressing.
- Let's hear about the T-shirts, please.

258
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,008
Okay. I'll tell you, and I'm going to be
one hundred percent honest.

259
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:35,055
But it doesn't make me look
great so don't judge me.

260
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,017
That's literally the purpose
of this entire exercise.

261
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:47,526
Okay. To understand this, you have to know
about my roommate, Madison.

262
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,404
- She was terrible.
- Hey, Mads?

263
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,073
Um, I have to go to
this stupid work party tonight.

264
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,825
Can I borrow your peach dress?

265
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,202
Ooh, it's a hard no, babe.

266
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,037
That dress is like twice your salary.

267
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,208
And I gotta go to the DMV
and pick up my vanity plates. Ciao, bitches!

268
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:26,815
Well, that's... that's not great.

269
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:30,193
But I assume you confessed,
and paid to fix it?

270
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,403
Not exactly.

271
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:34,614
Hey, losers, I'm going out.
Can you zip me?

272
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,034
Dude, that dress is hella ripped.

273
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:38,744
What?

274
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,663
Ugh! That stupid dry cleaner!

275
00:14:41,956 --> 00:14:44,750
Well, that's the risk you take
when you keep your clothes clean.

276
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,586
My mom's a lawyer.
Those asswipes are gonna pay.

277
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:50,297
She sued for nine hundred dollars,
for the dress

278
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:53,383
and eighty million dollars
in emotional distress.

279
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,011
The legal fees drove the dry cleaner
out of business.

280
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:01,350
Oh, boy. Wait, this story is
about T-shirts.

281
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,477
There's more, isn't there?

282
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:05,270
A little.

283
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:06,980
Check this out.

284
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:10,317
Somebody put the dry cleaner's story
online and it went viral.

285
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,818
Madison's famous.

286
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,988
The "Dress Bitch"? Yikes.

287
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:17,115
Serves her right.
Madison is psycho.

288
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,617
She totally overreacted.

289
00:15:18,993 --> 00:15:22,954
This is her fault.
- Yeah. Her fault. That works.

290
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:26,458
You guys, what is happening?

291
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,502
Someone egged my Lexus!

292
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:31,630
And I have like forty thousand
tweets calling me the "Dress Bitch"!

293
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,799
Over a loser dry cleaner man?

294
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,009
Why is everyone so jealous of me?

295
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:39,596
This is a trash city full of idiots!

296
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:45,435
The "Dress Bitch" is so catchy.
- Yeah.

297
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,062
I mean someone could totally
make T-shirts.

298
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,314
Oh!

299
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,941
No, no, no, no.

300
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:55,487
Do not tell me that
you made T-shirts that said that

301
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,614
and then sold them for a profit.

302
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,491
I wish I could tell you that, bud.

303
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,284
I really do.

304
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:05,038
Girl, check it out!
They're here!

305
00:16:06,707 --> 00:16:08,875
Wait a second.
Is this insane?

306
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:10,335
I mean should we be doing this?

307
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,421
Dude! Madison brought this on herself,
okay.

308
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,632
She's a nightmare of a person,
to everybody.

309
00:16:15,883 --> 00:16:17,801
Plus we already have a ton of pre-orders.

310
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:20,429
Here is your first cut of the profits!

311
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,180
Holy mama!

312
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,684
I can't believe you sold the T-shirts.

313
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:28,478
Does it help if they basically
sold themselves?

314
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:30,272
I think you know it does not.

315
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:32,691
What did you do with the money?

316
00:16:33,151 --> 00:16:35,527
I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.

317
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:41,992
Thanks, babe!

318
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:47,289
Next question!

319
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,708
Eleanor.

320
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,671
Given what you know about the people
who've been brought here

321
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:56,590
the lives they've lead.

322
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,593
Do you think you belong in the Good Place?

323
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:03,930
No. I don't.

324
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,732
Hello? Bad Place. What's up, idiot?

325
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:17,611
Hello. This is Michael, the Architect
from Neighbourhood one-two...

326
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:20,530
Psyche! We're not here right now,
so leave a message after the beep.

327
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:22,991
I hate calling these guys.

328
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,161
Hello, uh... this is Michael

329
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,206
the Architect from Neighbourhoâ
- Double psyche! We are here.

330
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,123
Who dis?

331
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,250
This is Michael

332
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:35,921
the Architect from Good Place
Neighbourhood 1-2-3-5-8-W.

333
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,299
I'm guessing
you've been looking for someone...

334
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,345
called "Eleanor Shellstrop".

335
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,556
She's here. Come and get her.

336
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:08,245
Let's get out of here

337
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:14,417
Hello, Trevor.

338
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:17,087
Hey, there he is!
Good to see you again, Mikey!

339
00:18:17,171 --> 00:18:19,005
Think fast, I brought you something.

340
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,590
Oh. Nuts! Thank you.

341
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,717
Thank you. Ah! Whaâ?

342
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:27,722
Oh, flaming snake ate all
the nuts you brought me.

343
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,933
Ugh. You're too nice to humiliate.

344
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:33,144
Oh, hello. Hi.

345
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,939
You look like a piece of crap.
Are you Eleanor?

346
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:39,609
Dude, you're like a legend
in the Bad Place.

347
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:42,237
Check this out! Huh?

348
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:44,990
Pretty great, right?

349
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:48,868
Trevor, do you know what caused this mistake?
Because I cannot figure it out.

350
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,371
Nah, we're stumped.
But, uh... don't sweat it, champ!

351
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:54,249
She's definitely one of ours.
So we'll just roll on out

352
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,500
and you can get back to, uh...

353
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:58,169
Putting rainbows up your butt,
or whatever you do here.

354
00:18:58,421 --> 00:18:59,963
Okay,
let's hit it, sweetheart.

355
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:01,089
We got a long ride.

356
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:02,591
What? Right now?

357
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,968
Trevor, for decency's sake

358
00:19:05,052 --> 00:19:06,219
let her have some goodbyes.

359
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:08,638
Ugh! God, good people are the worst.

360
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:11,057
Okay, uh... thirty minutes.

361
00:19:11,142 --> 00:19:12,517
We gotta get back for "The Bachelor".

362
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,811
I'm gonna be pissed if
I miss the rose ceremony.

363
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,565
I just want to say once more,
for the record

364
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:21,943
that this whole "Good-Bad" system
is bullshirt.

365
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:26,448
There should be a Medium Place,
for people like me

366
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:29,743
who kinda sucked,
but in like a fun, chill way.

367
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:33,538
I agree. I'm sorry there isn't.

368
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:37,876
I'm sorry I dragged you into this,
and that I never did laundry

369
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,504
and that I waited until you were
about to do yours

370
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:44,674
then secretly tossed mine into the basket
to trick you into doing it.

371
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,010
You didn't trick me.
I repeatedly asked you to stop.

372
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:50,472
Just know you did everything
you could to help me.

373
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,183
You're a really good fake soulmate.

374
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:06,029
What are you guys doing here?

375
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,573
Well, we thought it was only proper
to see you off.

376
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:10,033
It's the neighbourly thing to do.

377
00:20:12,953 --> 00:20:15,830
You guys came to say goodbye
because you're my friends.

378
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:20,919
Well, I suppose
some part of me, possibly

379
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:23,713
has a sense of casual kinship with you

380
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,383
as much as one might be fond
of a street cat.

381
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,302
Thanks, Tahani.

382
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:31,805
I'm sorry for everything.

383
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,809
I'm really glad we're friends.

384
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,228
Oh! Goodbye forever.

385
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:40,230
Jianyu.

386
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:47,278
Jianyu keeps such a stoic face.

387
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:50,532
I just hope he sends her off
with some sustaining wisdom.

388
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:58,707
I hate to see you go,
but I love to watch you walk away.

389
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,668
I really needed to hear that.
Thanks.

390
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:05,296
Oh, hey dum-dum!
You ready to go?

391
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,549
Oh. You must be Chidi.

392
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:09,384
Trying to improve her?

393
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,802
Bold plan, bro.

394
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:13,763
Bold and stupid.
My favourite combo.

395
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,473
Well, actually,
she learned a great deal

396
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,350
in a very short amount of time.
- Oh, really? Really?

397
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,352
I don't care.
All right, let's hit it.

398
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:21,104
Oh, also you should smile more.

399
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:23,565
You have such a pretty smile.
Love ya, babe.

400
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,066
Can't wait to torture you.

401
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:31,740
This is the 3:18 to The Bad Place

402
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:35,493
making thousands of stops
for literally no reason.

403
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:39,372
Now as soon as you take your seats
we will pull away from the station

404
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:42,459
and then immediately be
delayed for forty-nine minutes

405
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,877
and not explain why.

406
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,922
You'll notice it's very hot in here,
and it will get one degree hotter

407
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:50,091
every time you think about how hot it is.

408
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:52,802
Oops! You just thought about it.

409
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:56,639
Michael!
- Oh, hi, Chidi.

410
00:21:57,141 --> 00:21:58,224
Want some pizza?

411
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:01,978
Bad Place crew delivered a hundred
of these to my office.

412
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:05,523
All Hawaiian, the worst pizza.
- Michael, I murdered Janet.

413
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,360
I knew about Eleanor,
from the beginning.

414
00:22:09,403 --> 00:22:11,529
I've been trying to help her become
a better person

415
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:13,198
and when she found out that
your "retirement" meant

416
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,199
that you would be tortured

417
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:15,950
she immediately tried to find
a way to prevent it.

418
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,078
Which is why I ended up murdering Janet.

419
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:23,416
The point is, Eleanor is learning.

420
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,710
She's just doing it after she died.

421
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:30,381
And you did bring her here so,
in many ways, this is your fault.

422
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:35,053
Yes. Jianyu actually made that same point.

423
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:36,429
He did?
- Mmm.

424
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:41,100
Okay, look... I... I know you only
deal in black or white

425
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:42,435
good or bad.

426
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,355
But you said it yourself,
this situation is...

427
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:47,565
unprecedented.

428
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,777
I did enjoy her company.

429
00:22:52,446 --> 00:22:55,365
But this is not Little League.

430
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,035
There is no award
for Most Improved Player, Chidi.

431
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,538
Well, maybe there should be.

432
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,290
One final note

433
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,336
the dining car is at the very back
of the train.

434
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:12,465
It serves only room temperature
Manhattan clam chowder

435
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:14,676
and also it's closed.

436
00:23:15,553 --> 00:23:16,719
Okay! Here we go!

437
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,812
Stop this train!

438
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:31,484
Dude, what the fork?

439
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:32,735
You're not leaving.

440
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:36,364
Not with her. Not yet. Come on.

441
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:41,870
Wait, you want to keep her?

442
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,998
Bro, that's our girl!
We agreed on this!

443
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,209
No, what we agreed on was
that this was a mistake.

444
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,045
Trevor,
we're in uncharted territory here.

445
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,673
Until we can sort this out,
she stays with us.

446
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:55,133
All right, fine.

447
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:58,177
But until this is resolved,
we're keeping the other Eleanor.

448
00:23:58,596 --> 00:23:59,679
Fine. What? I'm sorry.

449
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,432
The other Eleanor?
Yeah, the real Eleanor.

450
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:05,226
The one that was supposed to be here,
but got sent down to us instead.

451
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,352
She's on the train.

452
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:08,271
Eleanor! Come on out!

453
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:17,822
Hi, everyone. I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.
