00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:06,294
♪ I see trees of green
Red roses too ♪

2
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:10,339
♪ I see them bloom... ♪

3
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:12,883
Hey, dingdongs, we've figured out
what's happened here.

4
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:15,886
You two are both named Eleanor Shellstrop.

5
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:18,764
The day you died,
you were both in Phoenix, Arizona

6
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:21,559
shopping at the same grocery store.

7
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:25,605
The "Real Eleanor" was attending
a conference on the death penalty

8
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:29,317
and you stopped by to pick up food
for a local homeless shelter.

9
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:32,612
And "Fake Eleanor"
was there buying margarita mix

10
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:37,491
and a magazine called
"Celebrity Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters."

11
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:42,288
Incredibly, you both died
in the same ten-thousandth of a second

12
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:44,624
in the same traffic accident.

13
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,918
Because Real Eleanor was trying
to save Fake Eleanor's life

14
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:50,087
by pushing you
out of the way of the truck.

15
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:52,423
I guess you really botched that one, huh?

16
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:55,635
I did. And I am so, so sorry.

17
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:57,470
It's all good.

18
00:00:57,596 --> 00:01:00,348
So how did you not realise
you had the wrong Eleanor?

19
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:03,976
Oh, we don't know what people
look like - only names and profiles.

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,520
On Earth, they're just dots on a map.

21
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:10,399
Yeah, whatever, we got our wires crossed.
We picked up the wrong dot.

22
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:12,943
Bluh-Bluh-Bluh-Bluh-Bluh...
- Not now.

23
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:14,945
Bluh-Bluh-Bluh-Bluh-Bluh!

24
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:17,281
Point is, there are two Eleanors.

25
00:01:17,658 --> 00:01:21,577
The nice, boring one is yours,
the trash bag is ours.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,497
So trash bag, let's go. Let's hit it.

27
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:27,291
And also, I'm still waiting
on that smile, gorgeous.

28
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,959
Trevor.
- Where's that smile?

29
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:30,836
Trevor, how about we negotiate.
Maybe give you something else.

30
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,673
What in the world could you have
that we would want?

31
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:37,468
All right, how about a unicorn! Right?
I bet you don't have one of those.

32
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:39,512
No, that is true.

33
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:42,306
Might be fun to skin it alive,
eat its raw flesh

34
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:44,934
maybe break off the horn,
grind it up, snort it.

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,561
Okay, let's keep talking. Yeah.

36
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:56,237
Fake Eleanor, a word?

37
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:58,948
It's just me, man.
You can just say Eleanor.

38
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:01,784
Sorry. It just makes things easier.

39
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:05,454
Look, I'm not even sure how
it would work for you to stay here

40
00:02:05,622 --> 00:02:06,956
now that we know there's a Real Eleanor.

41
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:10,042
But in the meantime, stay on your toes.

42
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:12,086
Don't let Trevor get inside your head.

43
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:13,629
Can I ask you something?

44
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:16,549
Why are you helping me?

45
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:20,469
Well, Chidi made a very good
argument on your behalf.

46
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:21,762
But it's more than that.

47
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:25,933
I truly believe that the
Good Place is where you belong.

48
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,310
You're part of our team.

49
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:34,483
Hi, you must be the new student,
Eleanor Shellstrop.

50
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:36,861
I'm Gloria, the senior class secretary.

51
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:37,945
Cool.

52
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:41,490
Welcome to Adobe High,
home of the "Scorpioties!"

53
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,576
Half the school wanted to be the Scorpions

54
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:45,995
half wanted to be the Coyotes,
so we compromised.

55
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:48,622
Why don't I give you
a tour after lunch?

56
00:02:48,749 --> 00:02:50,249
Yeah, no thanks "mop-top."

57
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:51,584
Uh... sorry?

58
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:56,172
Don't need your help, don't want to
sign your yearbook in, like, gel pen

59
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:59,216
don't wanna bedazzle
our college essays, or whatever.

60
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:00,801
I'm here for like six months

61
00:03:01,136 --> 00:03:02,762
and I'm gonna fly solo.

62
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:04,930
Beat it, Gloria.

63
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:09,351
She is like such a dork.
She, like, loves this school so much.

64
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:10,853
Why don't you come sit with us?

65
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:13,939
We'll teach you which guys are cute,
and which teachers are secretly "pervs."

66
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:16,233
Yeah, that's a hard pass as well.

67
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,528
I don't want to get chunky highlights,
make fun of nerds

68
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,572
and steal your mom's flavored vodka.

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,201
I get your whole "mean girl" thing,
and I'm all set with it, thanks.

70
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,494
In fact...

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,248
Listen up, everyone!

72
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,334
I'm Eleanor, I'm new here

73
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,462
and as a blanket statement for everyone

74
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:39,465
I don't want to be a part of
whatever little group you've formed

75
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:41,926
because they're all equally lame.

76
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:43,886
Everybody cool? Great.

77
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:49,350
Hey. It was really cool the way
you told all these poseurs...

78
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:50,267
No!

79
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,191
Tahani? Do you have a moment?

80
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:58,859
Oh, Michael. Of course, come in.

81
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:03,864
If I'm going to save Fake Eleanor,
I need some help negotiating.

82
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:05,533
I don't even know what to offer.

83
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,994
I mean, what do you get somebody
who wants to eat a unicorn?

84
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:13,123
A unicorn bib! Yes! No. No.

85
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,710
Unicorn holders, you know,
like corn holders, but for unicorns.

86
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:20,005
But perhaps it'd be better if we just
move away from the unicorn thing altogether.

87
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,509
No, you're right. You're right.
And anyway there's a bigger problem.

88
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:28,013
The Bad Place Crew, they're all
terrible bullies, and they outnumber me.

89
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,474
They even have their own Bad Janet.

90
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:33,310
I'll show you. Bad Janet?
- What?

91
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,315
Bad Janet, where's the nearest café?

92
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:40,234
Oh, that's a good question

93
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:43,445
it's up your mom's butt, you fat dink.

94
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:48,075
Bluh-bluh-bluh-bluh.

95
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:51,287
That's you, Michael.
Okay, that's what you sound like.

96
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:53,497
Do you hear yourself?
Do you hear him?

97
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:56,542
It's gross. What is wrong with you?

98
00:04:57,252 --> 00:05:01,005
What is even the purpose of a Janet
who behaves in such a manner?

99
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:03,007
Unclear. But the point is

100
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:07,261
I never have to deal with
negative emotion of any sort.

101
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:09,305
I could use some backup, Tahani.

102
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:10,723
Oh, Michael, of course.

103
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,516
Why don't you just bring them all here.

104
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:15,269
Surely this magnificent house
will placate them?

105
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:16,729
Oh, thank you. I'll be right...

106
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:22,568
Oh, Tahani, you... you eat junk food?

107
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,696
Oh, uh... it's my cheat day.

108
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:28,824
Well, you're already dead so go nuts, right?

109
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,159
Yes.

110
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:32,453
Well, here's your house!

111
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:36,999
It's beautiful.
I love Icelandic primitive design.

112
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:40,628
I kinda wish it had a clown nook.
Oh! There it is!

113
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,924
Here's the bedroom. It's kinda hard
to get up on this dumb ledge, though.

114
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,472
You have got to be forking kidding me.

115
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:54,183
Hey! Fake Eleanor,
we used this same clown painting

116
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:57,102
to decorate the room you were
supposed to live in down there!

117
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,103
I swear to Bieber!

118
00:05:58,313 --> 00:05:59,563
Wait, what was your house like?

119
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:03,734
Well, I was living in what I assume
is Eleanor's worst nightmare.

120
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:07,988
Every day was basically one endless
baby shower, for a woman I didn't know

121
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:10,741
but also somehow I had to organise it?

122
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:14,703
And if I didn't remember everyone's name,
I got a very strong electric shock.

123
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,205
Yep, that was my pitch.

124
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:19,083
And then at night,
it was pretty classic torture

125
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:22,962
flying piranhas, lava monsters,
college improv

126
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:25,506
and there was always jazz music playing.

127
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:27,633
Ugh, I hate jazz!

128
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:30,469
Every jazz song is forty minutes long.

129
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:33,639
It's like, we get it,
you can blow on a trumpet

130
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,307
wrap it up, Elton John!

131
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,684
Famously a piano player.

132
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:38,102
I don't mean to be a bother

133
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:40,354
but could I possibly get some water

134
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:43,524
and whatever food doesn't
turn to spiders in your mouth?

135
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:46,527
Oh! Of course, so sorry.
Let's get some dinner.

136
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:47,778
Yeah, we'll all go!

137
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:51,490
Perfect double date - two losers,
a trash bag, and a demon.

138
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,658
Let's hit it!

139
00:06:57,372 --> 00:07:00,124
All right, Michael, we're going to ply them
with delicious food and drink

140
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,085
and then we're going
to subtly segue into negotiation.

141
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:06,588
They're sure to be in a good mood.
Everything is absolutely beautiful.

142
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:09,174
This sucks, dude.

143
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:13,262
Yeah, this food uh... blows.
Yo, Good Janet!

144
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:14,221
Hi there!

145
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:16,974
Oh. Get me some jalapeño poppers.
- Sure.

146
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,435
Quick question, what is a "jalapeño?"

147
00:07:19,769 --> 00:07:22,730
Also, what is a "poppers?"
Also, what is "jalapeño poppers?"

148
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:28,068
Oops! Sorry, guys.
In the confusion, Janet got rebooted

149
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:31,572
so she hasn't quite uploaded
all of the info she usually knows.

150
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:37,536
That's hilarious.
She's almost as stupid as people!

151
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:41,665
Oh! Hey, now, come on.
Let's not insult people, please.

152
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:45,044
Ugh. You have such
a "stiffy" for human beings.

153
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:49,965
"I'm Michael, I love idiot humans!"

154
00:07:51,176 --> 00:07:53,427
I gotta admit, that does sound like me.

155
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:56,555
"I gotta admit, that does sound like me!"

156
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:59,558
Nailed it again!

157
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,935
Go get me a drink.
- Yes, of course.

158
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,026
Ah, man, this is gonna
make a primo dump later on.

159
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:12,529
Well, that looks delicious. What is that?

160
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:14,281
It's Tom Yum Gong soup.

161
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:18,118
It reminds me of when I was in Thailand,
rescuing victims of human trafficking.

162
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:22,247
Oh, that sounds so good!
I mean, the soup, not the human trafficking.

163
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,750
I think your grilled eggplant looks so good.

164
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:26,960
- Should we...
- "Splitsies!"

165
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:32,674
I can't believe you thought
you could pretend to be Real Eleanor.

166
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:38,055
She's like a perfect ball of light,
and you're like a wet pile of mulch.

167
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:41,225
Someone made a person
out of wet mulch and leaves

168
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,852
and dead slugs, and that's you.

169
00:08:44,187 --> 00:08:47,272
Whatever. It's easy
when you're just born perfect.

170
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:50,609
My parents were both "dirtbags"
who split up when I was eight.

171
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:52,319
I don't mean to eavesdrop

172
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:54,154
but did you say your parents got a divorce?

173
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,740
Yeah, and that kind of thing
really changes a person.

174
00:08:56,866 --> 00:09:01,495
I mean, that trauma,
it can explain away a lot of behaviour.

175
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:02,663
Oh, of course.

176
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:04,832
Your parents are still together, I guess?

177
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:09,169
Oh, actually, I'm not sure.
I never met my birth parents.

178
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:11,213
They put me in an empty fish tank

179
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,090
and abandoned me
at a train station in Bangladesh.

180
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:18,428
Luckily, I was found and adopted by
a very nice couple - the Shellstrops.

181
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,721
Oh, thank god.

182
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:22,808
But then they died
when I was four - bird flu.

183
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:25,060
That's awful.
- Oh, no, it wasn't that bad.

184
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,354
Another orphan taught me
how to read and write.

185
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,692
Although when I was nine I found out she'd
taught me a gibberish language as a prank.

186
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:35,946
So I had to relearn everything from "snorf."
Sorry, scratch.

187
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:38,824
Still a few gaps in my language acquisition.

188
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:41,535
Anyway, the orphanage burned down,
"yadda-yadda-yadda"

189
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:44,037
made my way to America,
"yadda-yadda-yadda"

190
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:46,331
learned English from watching Seinfeld

191
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:49,334
put myself through law school,
and here I am!

192
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:52,629
Huh. I'm sorry, what is it
you said happened to you?

193
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:55,424
The same thing that happens to
half of all kids in America?

194
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,136
And for you to have gone through all that

195
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:01,555
and to end up where you did,
it is just...

196
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,849
it's just amazing.

197
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:07,853
Oh man, these "horndogs"
are vibing like "mofos!"

198
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:10,981
Am I right, Fake Eleanor?
- Please stop calling me that.

199
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,233
Oh, you got it, Third Wheel.

200
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:16,904
Yeah, that wine's no good
I'm sending it back.

201
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:23,702
Hey, Janet!

202
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,121
You look sad.

203
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:29,416
People keep asking me questions
that I don't know the answers to.

204
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,418
That was my whole life on Earth.

205
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,713
You know, it doesn't matter
if you know things

206
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:37,341
all that matters is what's in your heart.

207
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:38,759
Thanks, Jianyu.

208
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:42,596
I mean, it does matter if I know things,
because I'm an informational delivery system

209
00:10:43,014 --> 00:10:45,098
and I don't have a heart, but thanks.

210
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,602
Jianyu, I know usually you ask me questions

211
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:50,229
but can I ask you a question?

212
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:53,440
Sure.
- What are "jalapeño poppers?"

213
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:55,067
Oh! I know this one!

214
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:58,237
Okay. They're deep fried jalapeños
filled with cheese.

215
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:01,490
One time,
at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Jacksonville

216
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:03,951
the nice one,
not the one above the gas station

217
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:06,745
I ate fifty of them in two minutes.

218
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:09,373
Everyone at the hospital was so impressed!

219
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,124
Got it! Thanks, Jianyu!

220
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,334
You're welcome!

221
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:18,840
Why did you do that?

222
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:22,094
Because you're the only person
here that's nice to me.

223
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:23,845
Okay.

224
00:11:28,685 --> 00:11:30,477
Anyone up for a little icebreaker?

225
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,688
You know, I once did trust falls
with Barry Diller

226
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,773
and it was the beginning
of a lifelong friendship.

227
00:11:34,857 --> 00:11:36,650
And then, once we trust each other

228
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:39,111
then we can discuss
making a deal for Fake Eleanor.

229
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,990
This sucks! How do you guys eat
without listening to hard-core porn?

230
00:11:43,741 --> 00:11:46,535
Oh, come on, this is the Good Place.
You can do anything you want!

231
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:50,372
What about throwing a "rager"
and totally trashing this place?

232
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,499
Ooh! Yeah, I'd be into that.

233
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,126
We could totally go to town.

234
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:57,004
You know, I actually don't think
that's such a good idea.

235
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,380
Let's party!

236
00:11:58,548 --> 00:11:59,965
♪ Who let the dogs out! ♪

237
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:01,258
Oh my god!

238
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:04,970
♪ Who-who-who-who-who,
who let the dogs out! Who-who-who. ♪

239
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:07,055
So, um...

240
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:09,599
Chidi tells me that
he's teaching you about ethics.

241
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:14,187
Yeah. Actually, we've had some
interesting and in-depth classes.

242
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:16,231
He taught me about
Plato and Socrates...

243
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:18,525
Yeah, cool, shut up.
Let's cut to the chase, here.

244
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:19,443
You two go to "Poundtown?"

245
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:23,780
"Poundtown," bro!
You two bang it out? She "hot for teach'?"

246
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:27,534
Did you pork the dork? Come on, girl,
dish me "dem dirty deets!"

247
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:31,830
I assure you, our relationship
was "teacher-student". Nothing more.

248
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,207
Chidi, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

249
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:37,502
Whatever happened before I arrived
is none of my business.

250
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,297
Hey, I'd love to see
the rest of the Neighborhood.

251
00:12:40,423 --> 00:12:43,717
Yes, it's incredible.
There's an amazing library

252
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,803
there's a beautiful, piranha-free lake.

253
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:49,890
Well, please show me everything.
You ready, Eleanor?

254
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:53,518
I've seen it all already.
You guys go ahead.

255
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:56,104
You'd rather be alone, with him?

256
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:58,231
Fire in the hole.
Watch your heads, ladies.

257
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:00,359
My dudes tend to
boomerang around the room.

258
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:07,157
Yeah. I mean, I don't need to walk around and
nerd out about old books.

259
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,075
I'm good.

260
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:10,744
Okay.

261
00:13:13,331 --> 00:13:16,083
Hey, a bunch of us are gonna go see
"Spider-Man 2" tonight.

262
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,125
Do you wanna come?

263
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,169
They made a second Spider-Man?

264
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:22,631
What is there left to say?
Sure, whatever, I'm in.

265
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,967
Cool. I'll get tickets for the eight of us,
and you can just pay me back in cash.

266
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:28,595
So you can get all the points
on your credit card

267
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,972
and the rest of us get screwed?
No way!

268
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:33,433
No, it's just so we can all
get tickets before they sell out.

269
00:13:33,643 --> 00:13:34,643
Do you want to buy them?

270
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:38,021
So you guys can never pay me back and I'll be
out 80 bucks?

271
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:40,982
Nice try! I'll buy my own ticket.

272
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,693
The rest of the group
can do whatever they want.

273
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,115
Where did she end up?

274
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:54,704
Bought it with points, baby! My points!

275
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,543
I think I need to find a new place to live.

276
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,631
No, no, no. Don't. Don't. All right.

277
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:08,635
Want a bump?

278
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,679
No, thank you. I don't use cocaine.

279
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:14,391
Oh, it's not cocaine, idiot.
We're snorting time.

280
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,643
Sorry, you're sorting the concept of time?

281
00:14:16,894 --> 00:14:18,645
Yeah, it'll fork you up.

282
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,565
Yo, monk dude.
You know how to tap a keg?

283
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,359
Karaoke time!

284
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,320
Dana baby, what do you want to do?

285
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,197
Okay, a Mussolini speech?

286
00:14:29,365 --> 00:14:31,450
Ooh, the Mel Gibson Rant - that's a classic.

287
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:35,954
Ooh let's do the Nixon Tapes.
That's my jam.

288
00:14:36,497 --> 00:14:39,166
"What you always have to remember
with the Irish is they get mean.

289
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,335
Virtually every Irish I've known
gets mean when he drinks."

290
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:45,088
Whoo!

291
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:47,299
Michael, tell them to stop!

292
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:50,177
Oh, I think I've made it pretty
clear that I don't approve.

293
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:52,429
Hey, idiot! Dance!

294
00:14:52,513 --> 00:14:53,388
You got it!

295
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:56,057
"It's about damn time that
the Jew in America realises

296
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,310
he's an American first
and a Jew second."

297
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:02,481
I lit him on fire and he never spoke again.

298
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:06,234
You know, maybe I'm not
as great as Real Eleanor

299
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,028
but I'm better than I used to be.

300
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:10,780
I'm medium good.

301
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,326
Why haven't you "forkers"
invented a medium place?

302
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,497
Look, I know you've been trying
to become a "better" person.

303
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:19,956
You didn't wanna get caught, I get it.

304
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:24,211
But I read your file.
You don't belong here.

305
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:28,215
She spent her weekends
breaking up dog fighting rings.

306
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,967
You once saw a meter maid
writing you a ticket

307
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,845
and you barked like a dog
until she ran away.

308
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:37,182
You burned every bridge.
You cheated on tests.

309
00:15:37,391 --> 00:15:39,809
You once said
that your greatest accomplishment

310
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,854
was inventing a new kind
of high school heavy petting.

311
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:48,026
Over-the-pants mouth stuff.
That was a real game-changer.

312
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:49,736
Yeah, I am a fan.

313
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:53,156
I mean, honestly,
you'll be happier in the Bad Place.

314
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,743
I mean, don't get me wrong,
you'll be miserable, we will torture you.

315
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:58,370
But you'll also be happier

316
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:02,916
because you won't have to keep trying
to fit in somewhere you don't belong.

317
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:07,921
Aight.

318
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:12,384
Let's go.
- Okay. Hold on, I have to ask.

319
00:16:12,635 --> 00:16:14,553
Is this thing gonna happen?
You and me?

320
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,179
Ew, no. Gross.

321
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:18,431
Okay. You know I had to ask, babe.

322
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,813
You know it's true. You know it's true.
- No.

323
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,399
Oh! I called it. I called it.
Did you guys go to "Poundtown?"

324
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,985
Did it happen? Did it happen?
- No, no.

325
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,195
We just walked through the sculpture garden

326
00:16:32,321 --> 00:16:34,573
reciting our favourite
Baudelaire verses to each other.

327
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:37,993
Oh shut up.
- How did you guys spend your night?

328
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:42,038
Oh, you know... just did a bunch of
Goldschläger shots with this demon.

329
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:44,332
Well, I'm sure everyone's tired.

330
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,126
I'm happy to sleep on the couch

331
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:49,379
and Real Eleanor you can
have the guest bedroom.

332
00:16:49,463 --> 00:16:52,132
Oh, no, no.
I am perfectly fine on the floor.

333
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:55,760
I've been sleeping on hot nails
for so long, it'll be a real treat.

334
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:00,432
I'll take the couch,
Real Eleanor can take the master.

335
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:03,768
No. Trevor took the master.
Oh, and he's naked.

336
00:17:04,353 --> 00:17:05,812
Cool.

337
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:07,981
Bit of an awkward "sitch" here

338
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:11,401
so you two lovebirds just do whatever

339
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,652
and I'm gonna go sleep in the bathtub.

340
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:14,529
Oh, that sounds very uncomfortable.

341
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:17,657
It's cool. You should see some
of the places I've passed out drunk.

342
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,577
My friend and I once
broke into Charles Barkley's house

343
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,288
tried on all his giant shoes,
woke up in the garage

344
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:25,874
snuck out through the doggie door
and, you know what?

345
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,169
This story actually gets worse
from there so I'm gonna turn in.

346
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:30,712
Good night.

347
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:32,922
Good night.
- Good night.

348
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,219
Oh...
- There are stairs now.

349
00:17:38,387 --> 00:17:39,471
Force of habit.

350
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:54,027
Oh, Tahani, I'm so sorry.
I will obviously clean all of this up.

351
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,613
I don't care about the house, Michael.

352
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:59,074
I'm just upset that you
let them walk all over you.

353
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,367
I know.

354
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:03,495
They're the only thing
in the universe that scares me.

355
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:04,913
I know what I have to do.

356
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,707
I just have to be more accommodating

357
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:09,417
offer them everything they want.

358
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,128
Give in to all of their demands,
and then they'll have to respect me.

359
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:15,256
No! You need to stand up for yourself.

360
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:17,050
I'm going to tell you the same thing

361
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,969
I told Mark Zuckerberg right before
he ousted Eduardo Saverin.

362
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:22,138
You are smart.
You are capable

363
00:18:22,306 --> 00:18:24,808
and the time has come to hit "Unfriend."

364
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,686
I also told Mark to lose the "the."

365
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:30,438
You know, just "Facebook."
That was me.

366
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:44,035
Oh! Oh! My head!

367
00:18:44,328 --> 00:18:45,954
Here. Drink this.

368
00:18:46,122 --> 00:18:49,290
How am I hungover? I thought
there were no hangovers here.

369
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,712
The Bad Place Crew requested
that the hangover filter be turned off.

370
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,923
They like them.
- Ugh. They are the worst.

371
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,133
Yes, they are.

372
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:00,927
So, Michael said we're meeting
at Tahani's place

373
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,679
in an hour for a negotiation session.

374
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,097
We'll walk over together?

375
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,184
You don't have to come, man. I'm good.

376
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,019
Just hang out with Real Eleanor

377
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:14,232
and name constellations after each other,
or whatever it is nerds do.

378
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:15,400
I'm fine on my own.

379
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:18,611
Eleanor. Just because we have
a new guest in the house

380
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:21,114
doesn't mean I'm not still going to be there
for you.

381
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:23,783
I'm in this. We're a team.

382
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:28,913
So, you've been temping for us for a year now

383
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,540
and we want to bring you
aboard permanently.

384
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:32,625
We think you'd be
a great addition to the team.

385
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:35,336
Yeah, no, uh... I'm good.

386
00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:37,088
You're turning it down?

387
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:41,342
I just don't think
I'm really one of you guys.

388
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,553
You're all obsessed with this place, man.

389
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,931
You love working here,
and talking about working here

390
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,267
and you all hang out
like some kind of cult.

391
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:51,311
We hang out after work
because we're friends.

392
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,229
I know, it's weird!

393
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,316
If this is how you really feel,
I think I have to fire you.

394
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:58,985
Severance pay? Love it.

395
00:19:59,069 --> 00:20:00,236
Good looking out, boss!

396
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:02,864
Peace!

397
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:04,991
You need me to lie to old people

398
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:07,827
and scare them into buying
fake allergy medicine, I get it, man.

399
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:10,288
Which one's my desk?
- That one over there.

400
00:20:10,414 --> 00:20:12,582
All you gotta do is hit your
minimal sales target every week.

401
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:18,046
Cool. And you guys don't have any
lame mandatory office hangouts, right?

402
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:19,130
Hell no.

403
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,132
Some people go for a drink after work

404
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:24,302
and I run the occasional group drill
to see how fast we can shred evidence

405
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,763
but that's it.
Most days you'll be able to avoid

406
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:28,515
even talking to another person here.
- Perfect.

407
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:30,683
Happy to be a part of the not-team!

408
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:32,268
It'll be a pleasure not hanging
out with you.

409
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:36,648
Alright, let's begin negotiations.

410
00:20:36,774 --> 00:20:40,276
Now we would like to discuss
various trades that we could make.

411
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,444
We're not negotiating.

412
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,114
See, Fake Eleanor and I,
we "bro'd" down pretty hard last night.

413
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:47,367
We hooked up.
- No we didn't!

414
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,663
Yeah, but who are they gonna believe,
me or a woman?

415
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:57,460
Point is, she knows that she doesn't
belong here, and she's giving up.

416
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:02,131
Is this true, Fake Eleanor?
Are you giving up?

417
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:05,009
Yeah, of course she is.
She knows this place isn't for her.

418
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:07,053
Let's go, dingdong. Come on.

419
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:12,559
No. I'm not leaving.

420
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:14,727
Oh, come on, sweetheart,
we've been through this.

421
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,230
You know you don't belong here.

422
00:21:17,314 --> 00:21:18,940
You're right. I don't.

423
00:21:22,027 --> 00:21:23,403
But I want to.

424
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,656
I used to never want
to be a part of any group.

425
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,950
But I'm a different person now

426
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,871
because of the person who helped me.

427
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:35,081
And I want to be like him.

428
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,750
I want to be like
all the people who are here.

429
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:39,627
You can, Eleanor!

430
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:41,671
Thanks, Real Eleanor!

431
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:45,466
And I love that you never call me
Fake Eleanor.

432
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:46,968
You really are great.

433
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:50,471
Ugh. Unless you two
are gonna make out, shut up.

434
00:21:50,931 --> 00:21:52,599
Look, if you don't come with us

435
00:21:52,641 --> 00:21:55,143
we're gonna have to turn
this matter over to Shawn.

436
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,812
Oh! Oh, no! Um... Shawn? Really?

437
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,898
Wait, who's Shawn?

438
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:02,901
He's the wise, eternal Judge,
who sits on high

439
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:06,779
has the final say on all disputes
between our two realms.

440
00:22:07,197 --> 00:22:09,324
And his name is "Shawn?"

441
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,951
Okay, look. I don't want
Shawn involved either.

442
00:22:11,994 --> 00:22:15,204
So how about you blow us away
with an offer so we can end this.

443
00:22:16,874 --> 00:22:17,749
Okay.

444
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:20,543
Here's my offer.

445
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:26,132
You get nothing!

446
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:30,386
We're not letting Fake Eleanor go,
and we're not giving you anything.

447
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,346
Get 'em, Michael!

448
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:34,390
You can summon every
evil creature you have

449
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:38,353
every weapon in your arsenal,
every four-headed flying bear

450
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:39,479
they have them down there

451
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:41,773
but we are not giving up!

452
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:45,234
I believe that Eleanor
belongs in the Good Place.

453
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,779
And if I'm wrong,
you can take her to the Bad Place

454
00:22:47,821 --> 00:22:50,406
and punish her all you want,
just really go to town on her!

455
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:51,616
Gah! Easy, buddy. Easy.

456
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:52,951
But she's staying here.

457
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:55,078
Now, all of you

458
00:22:56,163 --> 00:22:58,122
get the fork out of my Neighbourhood.

459
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:05,380
You're on borrowed time, Fake Eleanor.

460
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:08,216
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Let's roll, dummies.

461
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:10,593
Let's get one drink for the road.

462
00:23:10,844 --> 00:23:12,345
Did you guys hear any of that?

463
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:15,056
Oh, my...

464
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:18,226
Bravo, Michael! Really!

465
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:31,656
Hello, Jianyu.

466
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:33,908
You got sloppy.

467
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,703
I found your junk food
all over the house.

468
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:41,082
And then last night,
you knew how to tap a keg.

469
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:45,920
So I thought I would come in here
and investigate your little "meditation den"

470
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:48,256
and what I found was this.

471
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,135
Now, I don't know who you are

472
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:56,305
but I do know that you're not
a Buddhist monk.

473
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,434
So let's chat, shall we?
