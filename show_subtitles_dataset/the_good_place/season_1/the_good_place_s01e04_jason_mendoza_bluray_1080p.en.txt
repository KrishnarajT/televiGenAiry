1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,536
Hang on, hang on -
you're not supposed to be here either?

2
00:00:05,871 --> 00:00:07,497
You're a mistake, just like me?

3
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:08,873
Yeah, and I'm freaking out, dog!

4
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:11,792
There's so much thoughts in my brain
it's like my head is filled with rocks.

5
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:15,046
How have you managed
to stay undiscovered?

6
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:18,674
Because I have had to dodge and weave
and barely escape with my life

7
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:23,221
and you don't seem... like a super genius.

8
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:27,558
Hello, Jianyu, I'm Michael.

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:32,688
Before we start, I know you were
a Buddhist monk and kept a vow of silence.

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:35,274
Would you prefer
to remain silent here, as well?

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,570
You literally haven't said a word
since we got here?

12
00:00:39,613 --> 00:00:43,074
Yeah. When I say I'm meditating,
I'm just trying to figure out

13
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:44,325
what the fork is happening!

14
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:46,035
I think we might be in an alien zoo.

15
00:00:46,078 --> 00:00:47,328
Or on a prank show.

16
00:00:47,746 --> 00:00:49,205
No, Jianyu, we're dead.

17
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:51,123
Whoa, that's a dope prank.

18
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,500
Whew, gotta give it up.

19
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:57,380
Okay. I need to make sure
that this isn't some sort of weird trap.

20
00:00:57,839 --> 00:00:59,340
Is your real name "Jianyu?"

21
00:00:59,383 --> 00:01:01,175
No, it's Jason Mendoza.

22
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:03,761
And, by the way,
everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese.

23
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:06,430
I'm Filipino. That's racist.

24
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:07,807
Heaven is so racist!

25
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:10,351
But Tahani said that you helped Michael

26
00:01:10,394 --> 00:01:14,105
by putting your hand on his chest
and doing some sort of healing magic?

27
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:18,526
Yeah, a nurse did that to calm me down once,
when I crashed my jet ski into a manatee.

28
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:20,903
You crashed your jet ski into a manatee?

29
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:23,864
Yeah. I'm from Jacksonville, Florida.
It happens a lot.

30
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:25,992
What did you do for a living?

31
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:28,369
I was an amateur DJ.
specialising in EDM.

32
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,162
Electronic Dance Music?

33
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:32,832
I was also an amateur
hip-hop backup dancer

34
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:35,960
an amateur body spray inventor,
um... I did pranks on Vine...

35
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:37,169
None of those are jobs.

36
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:38,379
What did you do to make money?

37
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:40,381
Oh, I sold fake drugs to college kids.

38
00:01:40,424 --> 00:01:43,175
Okay. Good.

39
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:45,094
Okay, here's my biggest question.

40
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:48,681
How did you know
that I didn't belong here?

41
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:55,104
I figured it out the very first night,
at the party, using my powers of deduction.

42
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,064
I heard you don't talk.

43
00:01:57,107 --> 00:02:02,445
Well here's something for you
to not talk about - I don't belong here!

44
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:07,158
They made a mistake.
Total phony. So, shh!

45
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:11,203
Okay. Later, man.

46
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:15,041
Okay, I vaguely remember that.

47
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,960
I believe you, Jason.

48
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,587
You're not supposed to be here.

49
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:21,672
Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.

50
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:31,140
Hello, Tahani!

51
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:33,017
Oh! Hello, Michael!

52
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,395
I was just picking out some fresh orchids
for my nightly orchid bath.

53
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:40,608
So, Tahani, one of your fellow residents
is opening a new restaurant tonight.

54
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:43,319
This Neighbourhood could use
a real morale boost -

55
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,446
and since you're an expert
at event planning

56
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:47,823
I was hoping that you would help
with the Grand Opening.

57
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:49,784
Oh, Michael! Say no more!

58
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:51,661
I wasn't going to! I was done!

59
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,497
Well, good! Because of course I will.

60
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,790
Janet?
- Hi there.

61
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:57,083
Oh! Hello, darling.

62
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,878
I would like to model tonight's event
on my most successful gala.

63
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:06,258
That would be 2006 fundraiser
for stem cell research in Barcelona.

64
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:08,010
"Barthelona," actually.

65
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:09,887
Oh, it was a perfect evening.

66
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,306
Princess Stephanie was there,
as were Posh and Becks.

67
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:16,268
You know, International Sophisticate
Magazine gave us five Gwyneths!

68
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:20,314
Tonight I'm going to select
my jauntiest suit.

69
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:23,109
And I may even wear suspenders.

70
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:24,110
Ah!

71
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:26,904
It's one of the human clothing items
I'm most eager to try.

72
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,656
Oh. Well, good luck.

73
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,533
Thank you, yes, yes.

74
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:32,660
I'm excited and... a little nervous.

75
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,995
I'd say that I'm "cautiously optimistic."

76
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:38,332
I hope I don't chicken out
at the last second.

77
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,918
Sorry, we are talking
about suspenders, right?

78
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,586
Like, these?

79
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,296
You can do that with them?

80
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:46,006
Oh! I cannot wait!

81
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:47,550
Excellent.

82
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:49,802
So Tahani has no idea about me?

83
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:53,180
No. She thinks I'm a monk,
and she thinks you're her best friend.

84
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:54,932
Great. I mean, for us.

85
00:03:54,975 --> 00:03:56,392
That's a huge bummer for her.

86
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:59,478
We need some place
that we can talk in private.

87
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:00,521
I agree.

88
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:03,274
Let me show you my bud-hole.

89
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:06,360
What?
- I should warn you, it's a little messy.

90
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:10,865
This is my Bud-Hole.

91
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,577
It's just like a hole where me
and my buds can hang out.

92
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:18,122
Oh! "Bud-hole." Okay, now I get it.

93
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:21,292
I wrote down on a piece of paper
that I needed a private "meditation area."

94
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,043
Tahani will never come in.

95
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:27,214
Pretty unique decorating style
you have here, Jianyu.

96
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:31,135
It's like, "12 year-old boy"
meets "13 year-old boy."

97
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:34,597
Thanks! Janet helped me get all this stuff.
She rules.

98
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,808
Is she single?
Or is she married to Michael?

99
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:40,060
No, no, dude. You cannot date Janet.

100
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:41,520
"A," she's not human

101
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:44,815
and "B," you have to keep pretending
to be Tahani's soulmate.

102
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:47,526
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool.

103
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,112
Okay, just sit tight, dude.
I have a class to get to.

104
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:51,655
What? A... a class?

105
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:54,158
I... I didn't know there were classes!
I was sick.

106
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,118
I have a note.
- No, no, no.

107
00:04:56,161 --> 00:05:00,456
Chidi is trying to teach me
to be a good person, and it's really hard.

108
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:03,292
Also, Michael has asked me to be
his "assistant," whatever that means.

109
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:06,504
My whole situation here is getting
like more and more dicey.

110
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:10,674
So I'm actually really glad to have a place
I can come when I just want to be myself.

111
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:15,429
Yeah. I miss being myself.
Myself was the best.

112
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:23,771
Whoo!

113
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,068
What's up, man? You Jason?

114
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,070
You got two minutes.

115
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:34,198
Fred Durst is throwing an orgy
on a partially capsized yacht.

116
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,408
My dad just texted, it already started.

117
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:40,162
So I'll get right to the point,
I listened to your demo. You're terrible.

118
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,748
Really?
- Yeah.

119
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,708
Okay, you just don't have any...

120
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:46,752
what's the word? Talent.

121
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,588
But don't worry, you got something
better than talent, man.

122
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,757
You got my approximate size and weight.

123
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:54,218
I'm supposed to play this club
for the rest of the week

124
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:57,012
but I just got an offer
to DJ Scott Disick's afterparty

125
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:58,848
for the Amateur Porn Awards in Reno.

126
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,517
Whoa! Congrats, bro! That's the dream!

127
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,185
It's your dream, man. It's my Tuesday.

128
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:04,728
I just need somebody to fill in.

129
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,147
Put on the helmet,
press "space bar" on the computer -

130
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,524
those idiots
won't know the difference.

131
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:11,986
For the next week,
Jason, you are "Acidcat."

132
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,574
Whoa! There's a lot
of old gum in here!

133
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,994
Tahani! How are things going
in the front of the house?

134
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:23,247
Because to be perfectly frank,
things in the kitchen are going great!

135
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,416
Okay, I am right on schedule!

136
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:29,378
Chef Patricia, I have triple-checked
every single detail.

137
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,798
Your restaurant opening is going to be
the talk of the entire Neighbourhood!

138
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,134
Thank you for your thoughtfulness
and hard work!

139
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:37,011
I could not have done this without you!

140
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:38,304
Ah! Hello, Tahani.

141
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:41,515
Sorry, I should've warned you.

142
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:46,520
Patricia is actually very happy
but she's also very intense.

143
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:47,771
It can be confusing.

144
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,690
No, no, no, that's not
what's bothering me.

145
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:50,858
It's just that, well...

146
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,528
I looked at the guest list earlier
and Jianyu isn't invited?

147
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:56,322
Right.

148
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,824
Jianyu is a beautiful spirit.

149
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,035
But he literally doesn't talk.

150
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:04,288
And since this will be
an evening of lively conversation

151
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,040
and you'll be busy working,

152
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,500
I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable.

153
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,461
I totally understand.

154
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,421
Well-reasoned, Michael.

155
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:17,092
As us Brits are fond of saying,
"Try your best to hide your sadness."

156
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:24,642
So the concept of the "self"
is a key subject for a lot of great thinkers.

157
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,602
In the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tzu wrote -

158
00:07:27,228 --> 00:07:30,314
"Knowing others is wisdom.

159
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:33,484
But knowing the self is enlightenment."

160
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,903
Ah! "Knowing yourself?"

161
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:39,031
Is he talking about
what I think he's talking about?

162
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:41,158
No, Eleanor, once again

163
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:44,828
none of these philosophers
is ever talking about masturbation.

164
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:48,332
Let's, uh... move on
to this week's main event...

165
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,710
David Hume's
"A Treatise of Human Nature."

166
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:53,379
You read this, right?
- I did.

167
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:54,838
Well, I tried to.

168
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:56,465
Well, I tried to want to.

169
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:59,134
Um, actually,
could we postpone this lesson?

170
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:03,973
I've befriended Jianyu from next door,
and I thought I could learn from him.

171
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,557
That's a great idea.

172
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,478
Hume's "bundle theory" of the self
is fairly close to Buddhism.

173
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:12,398
Yeah, no "durr!"
That's why I'm doing it.

174
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:15,901
Do you hear music?

175
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:17,653
That's not music.

176
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,365
That's EDM!

177
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:26,578
What are you doing?

178
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:28,455
Eleanor, you were right!

179
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:30,666
No more pretending!
It's time for me to be myself!

180
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:32,209
What's up, homey?

181
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,337
Eleanor? You broke Jianyu!

182
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,177
Okay, did we miss anything?

183
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,138
Ugh! Take that jersey off,
you goofball!

184
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,433
Okay. This is not my fault, I swear.

185
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:51,020
Eleanor, one hour ago,
that man was a silent Buddhist monk!

186
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,813
Right, but here's the thing.

187
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,606
Jianyu is actually...

188
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,860
a guy who is nice! Hi, Tahani!

189
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,279
Eleanor! Chidi! What a lovely surprise.

190
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:02,281
Don't mind me, I'm just dropping off
my afternoon gloves

191
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,074
and picking up my early evening gloves.

192
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,577
How are you, soulmate?
- I'm cool.

193
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:14,960
I'm sorry, am I going mad
or did I just hear you say, "I'm cool?"

194
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:17,504
Mmm. Mm-mm. I don't think so.

195
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:19,423
I don't think that happened.
You're... you're wrong.

196
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,675
Oh, I see what's going here.

197
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:24,636
You've got a Whisper
in your Snicker box!

198
00:09:25,221 --> 00:09:29,016
You're both helping Jianyu
to regain his confidence

199
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:30,809
to be able to speak again!

200
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:34,980
As a surprise for me!
- Oh, busted.

201
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,775
My heart is soaring!

202
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:42,154
So Jianyu is talking? Oh, how wonderful!

203
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:45,199
I will do everything in my power
to encourage him.

204
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,241
Well, not everything.

205
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:48,744
I won't give him a second mouth -
unless that would be helpful?

206
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,287
No. Better not risk it.

207
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,914
I've actually had a better idea.

208
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:54,666
Oh!
- Let's add Jianyu to the guest list.

209
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,460
Chidi and Eleanor
have been working with him

210
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:58,212
and they're going to be here.
- What a great idea!

211
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:00,839
Patricia?
We can fit another chair, right?

212
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:04,218
Change the floor plan?
An hour before opening?

213
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,262
Of course! The more the merrier!

214
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:09,098
Oh, hurrah!

215
00:10:09,349 --> 00:10:13,602
I knew tonight was going to be perfect,
but now it is going to be even perfect-er!

216
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:17,272
Obviously, it's impossible for something
to be more perfect than perfect.

217
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:19,483
Well, it isn't, actually.

218
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:22,277
Any place or thing in the universe

219
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:26,323
can be up to one hundred
and four percent perfect.

220
00:10:26,366 --> 00:10:27,616
That's how you got Beyoncé.

221
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,659
Oh!

222
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,872
Oh. "Bud-hole."

223
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,125
Okay. Now, tell me everything.

224
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,503
Okay. Jianyu is a fraud

225
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,130
just like me.

226
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:42,339
His real name is Jason.

227
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:44,967
He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.

228
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:48,095
It's gonna be fine. We just need a plan.

229
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:49,847
Oh, I got a plan.

230
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:51,974
We hack into Michael's phone

231
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:55,602
download all his nudes,
and then blackmail him.

232
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:57,896
No. What are you ta— No!

233
00:10:57,939 --> 00:10:59,565
Yo, you should listen to me!

234
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,150
I came up with hundreds
of plans in my life

235
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,484
and only one of them got me killed.

236
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:04,194
Dude! Be quiet!

237
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:07,197
You are not Jason. You are a monk
named Jianyu.

238
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:08,407
Got it?

239
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,001
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

240
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,628
Dude, another great set, Jason.

241
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:22,713
They love you, dude!

242
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:25,799
They don't love me, man.
They love Acidcat.

243
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:27,676
These cheers are fake.

244
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:31,096
They hit my ears
like boxing gloves of sadness.

245
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,516
Whoa.
That's some poetic thoughts, "B."

246
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:36,018
I gotta be myself!

247
00:11:41,524 --> 00:11:43,483
Attention Jacksonville.

248
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,027
I'm not Acidcat.

249
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,701
I'm Mr Music, the DJ.
And this is a Mr Music, the DJ original!

250
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,411
"NO!"
- Pow!

251
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:13,639
Welcome to the opening
of "The Good Plates".

252
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:17,726
I just got that.

253
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:19,853
That's hilarious!

254
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:22,481
Anyway, at some point or another

255
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:27,819
every resident in this Neighbourhood
will fulfill his or her soul's true purpose.

256
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:32,950
Chef Patricia has done that tonight,
by opening this restaurant!

257
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:38,330
Now, if you'd all like
to take a look at tonight's menus.

258
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,583
That's right!

259
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:42,918
With Michael's help

260
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:47,130
Chef Patricia has recreated
each person's favourite meal on Earth!

261
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,382
Fun!

262
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:57,933
It's my Grandmother's maafe!

263
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:01,228
Fresh perch, slow roasted
in a peanut sauce.

264
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:04,815
Almost makes me forget
how miserable I am right now.

265
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:06,775
You want to try a bite?

266
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:07,901
Fish and peanut butter?

267
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:08,944
No, I'm good, thanks.

268
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:12,739
Tofu? Aw, man!

269
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:14,074
I'm ordering some jalapeño poppers.

270
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:16,326
Shh! Be quiet and eat your white sponge.

271
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:21,873
Janet?
- Hi, there.

272
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,458
Hi. I didn't get a meal.

273
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,584
According to our files

274
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:27,879
your favourite "meal" was
the hunger strike you went on

275
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:30,257
to protest Bolivian sex trafficking.

276
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,135
Oh, right. Of course I did that.

277
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,054
Tahani? Great party.

278
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:37,681
Check it out.

279
00:13:37,724 --> 00:13:38,682
Oh!
- Suspenders!

280
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:42,144
So dumb.
So much dumber than belts.

281
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,605
Ah, congratulations, Michael.

282
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,816
How's Jianyu doing?
Is he opening up?

283
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:51,278
Mmm... not yet.
But I can tell he wants to.

284
00:13:51,738 --> 00:13:53,113
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

285
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:55,407
May I have your attention please?

286
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,451
Later this evening,

287
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:00,454
we will be enjoying
Chef Patricia's delicious dessert -

288
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:05,083
a stunning, three-tiered cake
that took her a full week to complete.

289
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:07,210
But first, I'd like to try something fun.

290
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:11,840
Each one of you has a very special memory
attached to the meal you're eating.

291
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,427
Why don't we go around the room
and share our stories?

292
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:16,678
Who'd like to begin?

293
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:20,349
I'll start, Michael!

294
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,102
One day, I wasn't feeling so great

295
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:27,981
so I made myself
a bowl of this chicken soup...

296
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,651
When it gets to you, say something short
and boring about tofu.

297
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:35,822
No! I'm sick of pretending
to be Jianyu the tofu man.

298
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:38,450
I'm gonna tell the story
about my real favourite meal.

299
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:39,534
Which is?

300
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:42,662
The Buffalo wings at Stupid Nick's
Wing Dump in Gainesville.

301
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:45,248
Wings were free for ladies
if they took their top off!

302
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,876
Oh, boy. Chidi? A word?

303
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:52,923
Anyway, that's how this simple soup
saved over ten thousand lives.

304
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:59,346
If Jianyu starts talking about topless
buffalo wing restaurants, we're all screwed!

305
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:00,972
Well maybe we should just let him talk.

306
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,349
He says he doesn't want to hide anymore.

307
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:03,767
He doesn't know what he wants.

308
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,936
He's an idiot from Florida.

309
00:15:05,978 --> 00:15:07,437
He's a "Floridiot."

310
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:12,651
Jianyu Li, Taiwanese monk who took
a vow of silence at the age of eight

311
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:16,488
and hasn't spoken since,
is ready to share with us.

312
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:24,496
Let me tell you about Stupid Nick.

313
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,459
We need a distraction!
Right the fork now!

314
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:33,839
No, no, no, no! Eleanor!

315
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:36,091
Chef Patricia poured her heart
and soul into this.

316
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,051
Destroying it would be
a truly cruel act.

317
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:40,512
Yeah, no "durr."
- No, no, no!

318
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:54,860
Sinkhole!
Everyone out, there's a sinkhole!

319
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,739
Glenn!

320
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,325
You broke the world!

321
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,411
It's not a compliment!

322
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:09,708
Glenn? Stay calm!

323
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,168
We're gonna get you out of there!

324
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,171
And we'll put your soup in the fridge,
so it won't go to waste!

325
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:19,468
I know that may not be
your number one concern right now, but...

326
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,928
It was up there. It's real good soup!

327
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,180
Let's go.

328
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:25,599
Hey, buddy!

329
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,142
You okay?

330
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:30,562
No. I was just about to tell
an awesome story

331
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:32,522
about a wing-eating contest
that I lost

332
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:34,858
and a barfing contest that I won

333
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,693
but then a hole opened up in the ground!

334
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:40,030
I know. I made the hole,
to save you from yourself.

335
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,283
You cannot let people know
who you really are.

336
00:16:43,326 --> 00:16:46,203
It would be very, very bad.

337
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,500
Beautiful, beautiful Jacksonville.

338
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:55,879
What's wrong, dog?
You look like you're freaking out.

339
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:57,881
Things are bad, Pillboi.

340
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:01,468
Acidcat is suing me
for "bleach of contract."

341
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:03,803
I should have never pretended
to be someone else.

342
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:05,847
It could cost me
all my dreams in life.

343
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,433
You got dreams in life?
That's lit!

344
00:17:08,684 --> 00:17:10,227
Course I have dreams, man!

345
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,854
I don't want to be a DJ
in Jacksonville forever.

346
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:18,944
I want to DJ in Daytona,
Tallahassee, Tampa, even.

347
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:20,529
I want it all.

348
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,739
That's big goals, man.

349
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:25,116
I know. But I believe in myself.

350
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:28,119
Someday, the world will see
what I already know -

351
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:33,291
that Jason Mendoza
is a beautiful, unique soul

352
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,752
who has so much to give this world.

353
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:40,507
Okay, that's Acidcat's speedboat.

354
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,466
Hand me the thing that blows it up.

355
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:44,427
That's lit.

356
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:55,689
Michael, I hereby tender my resignation.

357
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:58,733
I can no longer, in good conscience,
coordinate any further events

358
00:17:58,776 --> 00:18:01,987
in the Good Place,
so I am turning in my evening gloves.

359
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,489
Tahani...
- Don't try to make me feel better.

360
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,658
The launch was a disaster.

361
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:10,120
Poor Jianyu was so terrified
that I fear he may never speak again.

362
00:18:10,162 --> 00:18:12,581
My hair is barely
cascading down my shoulders!

363
00:18:12,623 --> 00:18:13,915
Tahani, please.

364
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:18,211
I know your journey
with Jianyu has been frustrating.

365
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:22,007
But your situation is actually very typical.

366
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:25,427
Soulmates sometimes
take months to really click.

367
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,886
You have to be patient.

368
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,224
And if anyone should take the blame
for the restaurant disaster, it's me.

369
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,019
I thought this Neighbourhood's
troubles were behind us.

370
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,187
Now I fear the worst.

371
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:37,981
Michael.

372
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:41,359
I hereby rescind
the tendering of my resignation.

373
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:43,069
We must keep
the Neighbourhood together.

374
00:18:43,237 --> 00:18:44,237
What can I do?

375
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,991
Oh! Well, the sinkhole should be
repairing itself in about three days.

376
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:50,118
Well, as soon as it does,
we shall relaunch the restaurant!

377
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:52,662
I'll hang posters to get the word out.

378
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:55,665
And in the meantime,
I'll host a brunch party, every morning,

379
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,916
to lift people's spirits.

380
00:18:57,293 --> 00:19:01,463
While you "re-pair" the universe,
I shall "pre-pare" the eggs!

381
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,298
Oh! Fanciful wordplay!

382
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:06,801
Indeed! That is the Tahani
that you know and love!

383
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:10,680
So what do we do, here?

384
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:11,806
There's nothing to do.

385
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:16,186
He's just gonna blab and get him
and me both sent to the Bad Place.

386
00:19:16,729 --> 00:19:17,646
It's hopeless.

387
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:27,280
Can't believe I'm doing this but,
Jason, please come to my classroom.

388
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:31,409
I will teach you ethics,
like I'm doing with Eleanor

389
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:34,162
and if you work hard
and absorb the material

390
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,539
you just might be able
to earn your place here.

391
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:41,211
Nah, I'm good.

392
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:46,925
Dude! Chidi is giving you a lifeline
right now and you need to take it.

393
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:48,385
Because you suck!

394
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:50,720
You suck!
- I know!

395
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:52,889
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

396
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:55,016
We both suck!
You know who doesn't suck?

397
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:59,062
Chidi. He is putting himself
in danger to help us

398
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:02,107
because he, unlike us,
is an amazing person.

399
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:05,318
I didn't get into heaven
to go to school.

400
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:08,488
You didn't get into heaven at all,
shirt for brains!

401
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:09,698
I just want to be myself.

402
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,866
That's a very, very bad idea.

403
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,451
Do not be yourself.

404
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:16,079
You need to be a better version
of yourself, okay?

405
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:17,330
And I do, too.

406
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:21,543
And our only hope right now
is this kind, selfless, amazing nerd.

407
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:22,961
Think about that.

408
00:20:23,003 --> 00:20:24,796
Eh, do you have to call me
a "nerd" so much?

409
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,923
I said a lot of other nice things,
okay?

410
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:27,882
Toughen up, nerd.

411
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:33,763
Let's get cracking, teach!

412
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:37,142
I read this entire David Hume book,
and then I read it again

413
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:39,602
because I didn't understand it
the first time, and now I'm ready to go!

414
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:43,523
Wow. Uh, that's really impressive.
Uh, where's Jianyu?

415
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:45,650
Honestly, I don't even know
if he's coming.

416
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,029
I am here to learn about "ethnics".

417
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:53,700
Wow! That's great, man!

418
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:56,619
Um, I mean, it's "ethics"
but that's great.

419
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:57,996
Pretty sure it's "ethnics."

420
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:00,457
Hey, buddy? I'm proud of you.

421
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,251
This is your first step
towards not sucking.

422
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:05,712
Cool. I just have two questions.

423
00:21:06,338 --> 00:21:09,966
When are football tryouts,
and does this school have a prom?

424
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:13,595
Oh, no.
- Oh, wow.

425
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,974
For the first time ever,
I'm the smartest kid in class.
