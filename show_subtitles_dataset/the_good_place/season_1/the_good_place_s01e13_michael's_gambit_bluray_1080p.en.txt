1
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:11,282
Morning, Mike.
How's it hanging?

2
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:13,659
Oh. Fine, Dave, just fine.

3
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:15,703
I put your mail on your desk

4
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:19,790
and you have an appointment later
with the Director of Point Calculations.

5
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:23,669
Let's reschedule that.
Those things last like a thousand years.

6
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:26,631
Listen, we got the files
for the new crop of incoming

7
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:29,634
and the Big Guy thinks it's time
for you to fly solo.

8
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:32,803
I get to design it myself?

9
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:35,515
You've been an apprentice long enough.
You're ready.

10
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:40,144
It's... Oh.

11
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,733
Oh, Dave. I'm gonna work so hard.
My design is gonna be absolutely perfect.

12
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:47,985
OK. Easy there, rookie.

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,154
Starting immediately,
you'll be out of my department.

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,073
You'll be reporting directly
to the front office.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,117
This is your shot. Good luck.

16
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,421
The bad place is owed two people.

17
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:10,633
You have all done bad things
since you arrived here.

18
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:12,260
I don't care which two of you go.

19
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,594
You can decide.

20
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:14,887
You have 30 minutes.

21
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:21,102
All I ever wanted
was for this neighbourhood

22
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:23,646
my first neighbourhood, to be perfect.

23
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:25,439
Somehow I blew it and...

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,025
now you're all suffering

25
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:30,403
and for that, I'm deeply sorry.

26
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:38,828
This is truly
the saddest day of my life.

27
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,010
OK, I guess I'll speak first.

28
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:57,138
Jason and I are the mistakes.

29
00:01:57,222 --> 00:02:01,058
We're the ones who misled everybody
and dragged you all into this mess, so

30
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:02,893
we should go to the Bad Place.

31
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:03,936
Agreed.
- Yes.

32
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:07,815
OK, I thought you were gonna at least
pretend to fight me on that but whatever.

33
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,111
Hang on. That judge guy just said
everyone here has done bad things.

34
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:14,614
Let's look at this ethnically.

35
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:18,326
For what I hope is the last time.
It is "ethically".

36
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,286
You guys helped me and Eleanor, right?

37
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,956
But we're bad,
so you helping us was bad.

38
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:26,042
It's basic consequentialism:

39
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:28,836
the morality of an action
is solely judged on its consequences.

40
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:30,588
Great. That's...

41
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:33,758
The one time you actually remember
something from class.

42
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:36,218
Maybe I was brought here by mistake,
but since we've been here

43
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:38,179
I just tried to stay
out of everyone's way.

44
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:40,097
Chidi's done worse stuff than me.

45
00:02:40,182 --> 00:02:42,558
He murdered Janet. He killed my wife!

46
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:44,435
I was trying to stop you from doing it!

47
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,603
Yeah, but you did it.

48
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,063
He who smelt it, murdered Janet.

49
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,190
OK, well, it's settled then.

50
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:51,192
Eleanor and Jianyu are leaving.

51
00:02:51,276 --> 00:02:52,985
For the last time, my name is Jason

52
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,987
not Jianyu,
the amazing, incredible monk.

53
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:57,073
Which is why
you belong in the Bad Place.

54
00:02:57,157 --> 00:03:01,118
And by the way, Janet is not your wife.
Or your soulmate.

55
00:03:01,203 --> 00:03:02,703
There's a Janet in every neighbourhood.

56
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:04,372
Well, I'm in love with this Janet.

57
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:07,833
We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff,
which almost turned out to be sex

58
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:10,544
and we were married in a legal ceremony.
- It was not legal.

59
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,546
OK, J-bones, you and me, outside.

60
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:13,673
What? But...

61
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,759
I'm not going. I don't wanna.

62
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:22,264
I know you don't wanna, goofball.
I don't wanna either, but let's face it

63
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,518
Chidi and Tahani are better people
than we are.

64
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:30,523
We tried to improve ourselves
and you know what, we did a good job.

65
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:32,233
Well, I did a good job.

66
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:35,403
You mostly fell asleep in class
or made fart noises with your hands.

67
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:37,780
I could never do that on Earth.

68
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,282
This place truly is paradise.

69
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,451
Look at them

70
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:45,955
whispering away
like two Beefeaters on a tea break.

71
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,957
I bet they're plotting against us.

72
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,667
No way. Eleanor wouldn't do that.

73
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:52,211
You do have feelings for her, don't you?

74
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,922
I don't know. Y-Yes. But no.

75
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:57,425
OK, please don't make me think
about this again. My brain will break.

76
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,511
I'm sorry, it's just that I have
certain feelings for you.

77
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:02,096
You must see this.

78
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:04,890
The universe keeps intertwining our fates.

79
00:04:04,975 --> 00:04:07,017
At first,
we both get fraudulent soulmates

80
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,603
and now we may be going
to the Bad Place together.

81
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:12,398
It's meaningful, don't you think?

82
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:17,111
This whole romantic situation
is such a mess.

83
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:20,406
I am vexed, Tahani. Vexed.

84
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,867
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to contribute to your misery.

85
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:24,618
It's just that I'm frightened.

86
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,954
I don't have an actual soulmate.

87
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:30,833
What's gonna happen to me
when Jason and Fake Eleanor go

88
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,002
and you're off with Real Eleanor?

89
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,672
Whither Tahani?
- OK. Team meeting.

90
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,050
Jason has agreed
that the two of us should go.

91
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:42,803
Bye, Tahani.

92
00:04:43,346 --> 00:04:44,805
Sorry for everything.

93
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,559
After I'm gone, you can go ahead
and clean out my bud hole.

94
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:50,227
Thank you.

95
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:55,483
I love you so much, baby.
Promise me you'll visit?

96
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,609
I will not.

97
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,612
It is literally impossible
for me to do that.

98
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:03,491
Well, it's been real, dog.

99
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:07,286
Sorry, that's how I ended
most of my serious relationships.

100
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,580
Yeah, that checks out.

101
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,708
I feel like I failed you.

102
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:13,834
No.

103
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,045
Don't ever think that.

104
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,424
I was dropped into a cave...

105
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:23,093
and you were my flashlight.

106
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:26,680
Oh, goodbye forever.

107
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:29,683
I will miss you so much.

108
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,353
Oh, I'll miss you too, you sexy skyscraper.

109
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,149
OK, ready, bud?

110
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:39,652
It's gonna get freaky down there.

111
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:40,611
Noice.

112
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,196
Not in a good way, dummy.

113
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:47,284
Whatever happens, if we possibly can,
we gotta stick together. OK?

114
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,912
Good.

115
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:51,038
Let's grab Michael.

116
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:54,041
Come in.

117
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:56,836
Hi, guys. Sorry to interrupt.

118
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,795
Um...

119
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:01,090
I'm going to the Bad Place.
I'm taking one of the slots.

120
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:02,049
What?
- Awesome.

121
00:06:02,092 --> 00:06:03,926
I've been there. I know I can hack it.

122
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:07,888
Actually, I have kind of a rapport
with some of the fire monsters.

123
00:06:08,807 --> 00:06:11,976
Also, if I can prevent someone else
from being tortured

124
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,228
I should. It just seems right.

125
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,856
Eleanor, that's crazy. You belong here.

126
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:18,440
There's another reason.

127
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:22,736
Everyone here
is supposed to have a soulmate

128
00:06:23,613 --> 00:06:26,240
and my soulmate doesn't love me.

129
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:33,497
I don't know if you love the other Eleanor,
or Tahani, or someone else, but...

130
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:37,626
you don't love me,
which means that this...

131
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:41,005
will never really be my Good Place.

132
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:45,801
I'm going, so you only have to choose
one more person.

133
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,390
OK, that means...

134
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:53,767
That means that... What does that mean?

135
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,769
It means...

136
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,106
I get to stay here with my wife forever!

137
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:00,482
We did it, Eleanor!

138
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:04,111
USA! USA! USA!

139
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,240
USA! USA!

140
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,076
Woohoo! This is so dope!
I get to stay.

141
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:14,747
You realise if you stay,
I still have to go, right?

142
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,292
Yes, but, I get to stay.

143
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:20,294
Good point, bud.

144
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:21,879
Well reasoned.

145
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,967
Wow. Chidi is a terrible writer.

146
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,014
This is a real mess, huh?

147
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,766
No matter what they decide

148
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,226
I bet you're gonna be in pretty hot water
with your boss.

149
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:39,438
Wouldn't be surprised
if retirement were on the table.

150
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:42,483
Retirement?

151
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,609
Course, what do I know?

152
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:46,904
I'm just the All-knowing Judge
of All Matters in the Afterlife.

153
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,323
But face it, this is your mistake.

154
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,078
- Morning, Mike.
- Morning, Val.

155
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,122
Which one's which? I always forget.

156
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,541
Black is regular. Orange is anti-matter.

157
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:04,630
Working on your first solo design, right?

158
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:06,215
How's it coming?

159
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:07,883
Fine.

160
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:09,343
I guess.

161
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:14,556
Do you ever get the feeling
we could be doing it all... differently?

162
00:08:15,183 --> 00:08:16,433
I mean, it's always the same.

163
00:08:16,726 --> 00:08:17,768
We get the names

164
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,314
come up with the design, they arrive,
we move onto the next one.

165
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,858
We never even get to be there...

166
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,152
to see how fun it is.

167
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:28,570
Yeah, that is a bummer,

168
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,614
but it's a good system.
I mean, it works, right?

169
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:35,869
But don't rock the boat here, pal.
Just try to do a good job.

170
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:39,206
French vanilla?

171
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,500
Regular anti-matter's fine.
Why flavour it?

172
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:45,421
A good job.

173
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,150
OK, all things being equal,
and please check my ethical math here

174
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:09,486
the right move for me is to go, right?

175
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:11,905
Jason does seem to love Janet.

176
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,241
And he's not taking anyone's place

177
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,535
because the real Jianyu
isn't even dead yet.

178
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:18,203
So I should go.

179
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:19,580
Wow.

180
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:22,624
You're making decisions
based on what's best for other people.

181
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,752
Yeah, dude. I'm not a monster...

182
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:27,212
anymore.

183
00:09:28,423 --> 00:09:30,174
Alright, nerds, it's settled.

184
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:33,302
I'll go to the Bad Place
with Real Eleanor

185
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:36,472
and you three can stay.
- Yes! We get to stay, baby. We did it!

186
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:37,890
Wait, no.

187
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,141
You're not going.

188
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,061
I am.

189
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:43,145
What?
- Why?

190
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:44,772
Real Eleanor is my soulmate

191
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:46,482
or was my soulmate

192
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:49,193
and she's only going down there
because she thinks that I don't love her.

193
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,319
Do you?
- I don't know.

194
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:51,904
Please don't ask me that.
My stomach hurts.

195
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,030
The point is

196
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,908
if she's going down there because of me,
I'll never be at peace.

197
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:57,493
Plus, Jason's right.

198
00:09:57,577 --> 00:09:59,745
I've done plenty of terrible things
since I've gotten here.

199
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,038
I deserve to go.

200
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:03,082
Yes! We get to stay, baby.
We did it!

201
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,958
No, dude, this is bonkers.

202
00:10:05,043 --> 00:10:06,668
I am going. End of story.

203
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:09,671
No, I'm going with Real Eleanor.
End of discussion.

204
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:12,341
No. I'm going. End of everything.

205
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:14,635
What? Now you're trying to replace Chidi?

206
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,221
No. I'm going to replace Real Eleanor.

207
00:10:17,305 --> 00:10:18,639
Chidi and I are going to go together

208
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:21,433
which means that you and Real Eleanor
and Jason can stay.

209
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:23,644
Yes! We get to stay, baby.
We did it!

210
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:27,773
Look, I love you,
and I think you love me.

211
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:31,902
We can be together,
away from everyone else.

212
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:33,445
Obviously, we'll be miserable

213
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,282
but I truly believe
our love will make us happy.

214
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:41,161
OK, you realise the Bad Place is not
some sort of couples' retreat, right?

215
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,038
If it is, Janet and I would like to go.

216
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:45,165
I am going! And Real Eleanor is going!

217
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,542
No, I'm going with Real Eleanor.

218
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:48,085
No, I'm going with Chidi.

219
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,628
Me and Janet are staying, just FYI.

220
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:51,755
Oh, that's enough out of you, robot lover.

221
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,257
Hey, that's racist.
- Not a robot.

222
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,384
Oh, you have some nerve.

223
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:56,343
Guys?

224
00:10:58,263 --> 00:10:59,304
Guys!

225
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:02,724
The only reason why I'm going
is because Real Eleanor is going.

226
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,935
If you go,
it doesn't make sense for me to go.

227
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,272
Look. You're not listening to me.

228
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:13,026
Holy motherforking shirtballs.

229
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:16,780
What?
- Oh, man!

230
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:19,116
Wow!

231
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,994
OK, OK.

232
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:23,954
Uh, whoo!

233
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,873
Yo, Mikey! Shawn!

234
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:27,791
Come on out!

235
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:34,423
Is everything OK?
- Right as rain, Mikey, my boy.

236
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:37,551
So, Chidi and I
are gonna go to the Bad Place.

237
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:39,887
What?
- Trust me. I've got this.

238
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:42,222
That's our decision. Let's hit it.

239
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:44,474
Well... What about Real Eleanor?

240
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,393
No, it's me and Chidi. Call the train.

241
00:11:48,396 --> 00:11:50,189
Point of order. I don't accept this offer.

242
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:52,357
The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.

243
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,443
Gah, gah, gah, gah!
You said any two of us.

244
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,445
It's me and Chidi. Let's do it to it.

245
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:00,866
Michael! I just found
an obscure precedent in the rules

246
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,242
that might just save everyone.

247
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:04,536
Buzz off, Bambadjan.
Don't need it.

248
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:07,497
Uh, OK.

249
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:11,376
Ready when you are, boss.

250
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:13,253
Eleanor, what's going on?

251
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,923
It took me a while to figure it out

252
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:19,968
but just now as we were all fighting
and yelling at each other

253
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,554
and each one of us demanding
we should go to the Bad Place

254
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,433
I thought to myself,
"Man, this is torture".

255
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,185
And then it hit me.

256
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:32,689
They're never gonna call a train
to take us to the Bad Place.

257
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:36,777
They can't. Because we're already here.

258
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:40,822
This is the Bad Place.

259
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:54,461
Oh, man!

260
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,965
I can't believe you figured it out.

261
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,010
Oh, God!

262
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:04,888
You... You ruined everything,
you know that?

263
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:09,559
Oh, man.

264
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,354
Eleanor, you really suck!

265
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:14,648
I was so close to pulling it off!

266
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,449
Sorry. So she's right?

267
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,243
Yeah, she figured it out.

268
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:29,788
No... No, this doesn't make any sense.

269
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:33,333
This is paradise.
- Oh, it looks like paradise

270
00:13:33,751 --> 00:13:38,839
but it's actually a filthy dumpster
full of our worst anxieties.

271
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:42,342
I'm surrounded by people
who are literally better than me.

272
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:46,305
Just me being here forced Chidi
into an ethical clusterfork.

273
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,597
Tahani tortured Jason

274
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,391
by constantly trying to get him to talk

275
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:52,269
Jason tortured me because I was sure
he would blow our cover

276
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:55,230
which was torture for Chidi,
because he was responsible for me

277
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:57,566
which made Chidi
seem like the perfect soulmate

278
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,027
and that tortured Tahani
because he didn't love her.

279
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:02,821
You don't love me?
- Please, don't ask me that right now.

280
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:03,905
See?

281
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,659
We've been torturing each other
since the moment we arrived

282
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:11,496
and everything Michael has done
has made at least one of us miserable.

283
00:14:12,206 --> 00:14:15,042
I had to be his assistant
and try and find myself.

284
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:19,296
He convinced me
to throw my life's work in the garbage.

285
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,091
He made sure I'd see
those bogus neighbourhood rankings

286
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,344
because he knew I'd hate
being second-to-last.

287
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:29,765
And I had the perfect bud hole
and no dudes to share it with.

288
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,184
He played us like a fiddle.

289
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:33,935
You gotta give it up.

290
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,895
Oh, dip!

291
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:38,190
Eleanor, I told you that first night
that we were in a prank show.

292
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:42,069
Oh, yeah. You did. Great job, man!

293
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,863
Chidi, don't go!

294
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:48,742
I don't care if you don't love me.
I love you.

295
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:52,162
It's the only thing that makes
any sense to me in this crazy world

296
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:55,165
and I think we should stay and try—

297
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:58,377
No, stop, Vicky. They figured it out.

298
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:02,214
- They...
- They know this is the Bad Place.

299
00:15:02,298 --> 00:15:03,799
Eleanor figured it out.

300
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:08,970
Oh, man!

301
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,514
This was supposed to be my big moment.

302
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:13,475
I just rehearsed that speech
for, like, three hours.

303
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:16,853
Damn it, Eleanor, you are the worst

304
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:18,313
and you can all suck it.

305
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:22,442
Do you remember what I told you

306
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:25,028
when you predicted you could do this
for a thousand years?

307
00:15:26,614 --> 00:15:29,282
The time has come to innovate.

308
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:34,955
The human afterlife can be more fun—

309
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:39,042
for us, obviously,
not for the people we're torturing.

310
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:40,961
Who cares about those dummies?

311
00:15:42,797 --> 00:15:46,591
I present to you the perfect recipe
for my proposed experiment.

312
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:51,805
Four people, perfectly suited
to make each other miserable.

313
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:59,813
I am going to design an afterlife
where they torture each other.

314
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:00,814
We've tried this.

315
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:03,024
Humans are very reticent
to torture each other.

316
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,901
Even getting them to do simple things

317
00:16:04,986 --> 00:16:06,987
like pulling out each other's teeth
is like...

318
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,282
I can't think of the right analogy.

319
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,742
Uh, what makes you think
that you can get them to do this?

320
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:15,620
Because they won't even know
that they are doing it.

321
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm going to make them think
that they are in the Good Place

322
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,836
and to make sure
that they drive each other insane

323
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:24,671
I will be there

324
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:29,176
posing as a Good Place architect.
- What?

325
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,887
I even stole a Good Place Janet
we can use.

326
00:16:33,181 --> 00:16:34,473
It can work.

327
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:38,268
Look, we can just send them all
to the hot spike pits

328
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:39,478
with the lava and the bees

329
00:16:39,562 --> 00:16:41,521
and the lightning
that tears off their flesh.

330
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:43,690
Let's try something new.

331
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,027
The thrill of watching them torture
each other

332
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:51,781
with personal deception and jealousy
will be so much more fulfilling than

333
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:54,951
I don't know, uh,
pouring spiders into people's eyes

334
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:56,703
for, like, the zillionth time.

335
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:58,455
Hey, the spiders work great.

336
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,624
Val, no one is criticising the spiders.

337
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,834
No... You've done amazing work
with the spiders.

338
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,837
Too many variables. Too many moving parts.

339
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:07,547
That's what will make it fun.

340
00:17:07,632 --> 00:17:09,966
I cannot predict everything
that's gonna happen

341
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:11,426
but we'll improvise.

342
00:17:11,719 --> 00:17:13,261
We'll... We'll be on our toes.

343
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:14,387
It'll be exciting.

344
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:16,556
I think...

345
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:19,518
that we can get them
to torture each other...

346
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:22,354
for a thousand years.

347
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:27,025
I think you'd be lucky to get six months
out of this insane gambit.

348
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,111
But take me through it.

349
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,240
- How would this work, exactly?
- Oh.

350
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,534
Yes, all right, so...

351
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,246
This is a 14 million-point plan.

352
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:42,707
Um... Oh, sorry.

353
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,126
I thought we reserved the conference room.

354
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:46,878
No, Todd, we have it until three.

355
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,296
Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

356
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:50,549
So...

357
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:56,179
Bambadjan, and Pavita,
and Gunnar, and Shawn...

358
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:57,847
Everyone else in this neighbourhood—

359
00:17:57,932 --> 00:17:59,099
Except for you four

360
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,811
everyone in this neighbourhood
is one of us.

361
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:05,313
After I came up
with everyone's characters

362
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:08,608
we'd just create fun scenarios
designed to torture you.

363
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:10,902
How can I be over it?
We haven't discussed it

364
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:12,696
or even spoken for days.

365
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,031
Well, it sounds like
you've had a really nice vacation

366
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:16,533
from your full-time job.

367
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:17,742
Get your story straight.

368
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:19,786
OK.

369
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:22,956
They're at each other's throats already.
This should put them over the top.

370
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,293
Ed, you play Bart, a former private eye.
- Ooh.

371
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:29,129
Oh, uh, maybe my specialty was I...
Identity theft cases.

372
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,797
Oh, he'll love it. Love!

373
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:34,467
Now, Tracy, you're his soulmate, Nina...

374
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:36,511
a marriage counsellor.

375
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:38,888
Maybe we can get them to swing with us.

376
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:41,558
That's perfect, perfect!

377
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:42,851
Shh, shh, shh.

378
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:45,729
Hey, guys? It's Michael.

379
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,273
That was really a fun time.

380
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:51,651
Then it all started to go off the rails.

381
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,987
When I confessed.

382
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:57,240
You had no idea I was gonna do that

383
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,327
because, honestly,
I had no idea I was gonna do that

384
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:02,203
Yeah, that came out of nowhere.

385
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:05,582
I mean, after that,
it was just a crazy scramble for all of us.

386
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,793
You know, I... I definitely underestimated

387
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:11,921
how effective Chidi was gonna be
teaching you to be good

388
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:16,259
and obviously, we didn't anticipate
that Janet would fall in love with Jason.

389
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:18,887
Hang on. That part is real?

390
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,681
Oh, yeah. Janet isn't one of us.

391
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:25,977
No, she's sort of a foundational mainframe
for all of the neighbourhoods

392
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:26,978
good and bad.

393
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:30,815
And apparently,
this Janet is in love with Jason.

394
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,942
I mean, co... What a world, huh?

395
00:19:33,027 --> 00:19:34,194
I knew it.

396
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:36,446
I love you so much, baby.

397
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,992
And I, in an indefinable way
that is not communicable through language

398
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:42,869
love you.

399
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:44,245
Wait, I don't get something.

400
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,792
I know why Jason and I were sent here,
but why Tahani?

401
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:52,796
Oh yeah. Didn't you raise, like,
$5,000 for charity or whatever?

402
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,882
Uh, 60 billion, actually, so...

403
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,094
Oh.

404
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:01,262
But it didn't matter...

405
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,808
because my motivations were corrupt.

406
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:09,479
I didn't care about helping the people
I raised the money for.

407
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:14,150
I just wanted to prove my parents wrong,
and stick it to my sister

408
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,860
get fame and attention.

409
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:19,072
My only real goal was to snog
Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.

410
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,075
Which I did.

411
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,285
Couple of times, actually.

412
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,787
Well, well, well.

413
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:29,916
Looks like Duchess Perfecto
wasn't so perfect after all.

414
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,293
I don't really think now
is the time to gloat, Eleanor.

415
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,087
Don't care. Gonna gloat a little.

416
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:37,549
But wait, why is Chidi here?

417
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:38,800
Well, um...

418
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:42,011
there's something
you don't know about me.

419
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,347
I read an article saying that...

420
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:46,891
growing almonds was bad
for the environment

421
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:50,979
and yet I continued to use
almond milk in my coffee—

422
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,605
No, dingus!

423
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:58,069
You hurt everyone in your life
with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.

424
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,073
Oh, fork!

425
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:03,992
You're right.

426
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:08,955
Every friend, every girlfriend
was driven nuts

427
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,082
because I couldn't do anything.

428
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:12,917
I missed my mom's back surgery

429
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:16,379
because I had already promised
my landlord's nephew

430
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:18,673
that I would help him
figure out his new phone.

431
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:20,341
I made everyone miserable.

432
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,218
Well, if it makes you feel any better

433
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:24,721
you were the closest
to actually getting in, up there.

434
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:28,558
You weren't that close.
You were just the closest.

435
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:30,268
Well, that makes me feel worse somehow.

436
00:21:30,352 --> 00:21:32,729
Good. Thank you, Chidi.

437
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:34,939
I... I really needed to hear that
right now.

438
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:38,568
I mean, all this hard work,
all the planning, all for nothing.

439
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:40,779
It really sucks.

440
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:41,821
No, it doesn't.

441
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:44,491
This is wonderful.

442
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,160
You saw us all on Earth -

443
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:52,081
a selfish ass, an idiot DJ,
a tortured academic

444
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,794
a hot, rich fraud with legs for days...

445
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:59,380
Side note, I might legit be into Tahani...

446
00:21:59,965 --> 00:22:01,299
but that's for another time.

447
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:04,135
You thought we would torture each other

448
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,429
and we did for a little

449
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:08,264
but we also took care of each other.

450
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:10,558
We improved each other

451
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:12,894
and the four of us became a team.

452
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:19,025
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing
was bringing us all together.

453
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:21,653
Oh, Eleanor...

454
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:23,738
that's it!

455
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:27,826
My big mistake
was bringing you all together

456
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,037
h-having you be soulmates
living next to each other.

457
00:22:31,455 --> 00:22:34,999
Next time, I'll spread you out,
so it's more of a slow burn.

458
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:36,751
Uh, next time?
- Yeah, yeah.

459
00:22:36,836 --> 00:22:38,294
I'm gonna, uh, erase your memories

460
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,713
you know, make a few changes
and start over again.

461
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:43,424
Hopefully. Just gotta get
the boss man to sign off.

462
00:22:44,176 --> 00:22:45,218
Wish me luck.

463
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,267
Guys, we need a plan. Quick.

464
00:22:52,643 --> 00:22:53,768
Tahani, anything?

465
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:56,312
Chidi, I need ya. You're the smart one.

466
00:22:56,397 --> 00:22:58,273
I... I... I can't. I. . I can't.

467
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,358
- Jason?
- What? What's up?

468
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:01,317
Ugh!

469
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:03,945
What do you say?
Take two, huh?

470
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:05,405
I don't know.

471
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:06,948
I mean, what is this?

472
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:08,950
All this work for four people

473
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:11,411
and me, I'm wearing a judge's robe.

474
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:14,747
I feel like a real weeny.

475
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:17,792
Look, for a first attempt
it was actually very promising.

476
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:21,129
Let me...
Let me just tinker a little, try again.

477
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:22,922
OK

478
00:23:23,674 --> 00:23:25,466
but you're way out on a limb here, Mike.

479
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,970
If this thing goes sideways again,
you are done.

480
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,682
Guys, he is going
to erase our memories at any second

481
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,517
and all of this
will have been for nothing.

482
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:36,769
Ugh! You're useless!

483
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:41,149
What do I write? What do I write?

484
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,191
Ooh, come on, brain.

485
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:48,489
Janet?

486
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:51,826
You can't eat anything, right?
- Correct.

487
00:23:51,911 --> 00:23:52,952
Open up.

488
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:55,872
All right, let's try again,
shall we?

489
00:23:56,332 --> 00:23:58,750
You know what, bro?
Do your worst.

490
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:01,085
We figured it out once,
we can do it again

491
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,795
because you know what, Michael?

492
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:05,340
Ya basic...

493
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:20,480
Eleanor, come on in.

494
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:25,818
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

495
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:27,737
Your life on Earth has ended

496
00:24:28,155 --> 00:24:32,283
and you're now in the next phase
of your existence in the universe.

497
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,036
Cool.

498
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:40,583
You know the way you feel when you see

499
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:43,544
a chimpanzee and a baby tiger
who've become friends?

500
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:47,423
That's how you're
going to feel every day.

501
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:54,430
Your medical relief mission to Kazakhstan,
that really put you over the top.

502
00:24:54,515 --> 00:24:55,765
You got a tonne of points for that.

503
00:24:57,393 --> 00:25:01,354
Eleanor? I'm Chris Baker.
I'm your soulmate.

504
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:03,898
Cool. Bring it in, man.

505
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:07,068
So where are you from, Chris?

506
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:10,363
I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey,
and I was a mailman.

507
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,532
Really?

508
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,621
Chris, you'll stand by me
no matter what, right?

509
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:21,457
Hold that thought.
Is it OK if I go work out?

510
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:26,504
I love working out.
I gotta stay jacked, it's... who I am.

511
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:27,880
Yeah, you gotta.

512
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:30,174
Once I'm back,
we'll get to know each other.

513
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:31,843
Great.

514
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:33,845
See ya soon.

515
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:36,097
Hi there.

516
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:38,057
Who are you?
- I'm Janet.

517
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:39,767
I think this is yours.

518
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:42,228
After I was rebooted,
I found it in my mouth.

519
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,771
