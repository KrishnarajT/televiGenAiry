1
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:25,568
Eleanor? Come on in.

2
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,831
Hi, Eleanor. I'm Michael.

3
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:40,791
How are you today?

4
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,919
I'm great. Thanks for asking.

5
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,921
Oh, one question.

6
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:48,216
Where am I? Who are you?
And what's going on?

7
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,009
Right. So...

8
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:53,179
you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

9
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:54,972
Your life on Earth has ended

10
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:58,976
and you are now in the next phase
of your existence in the universe.

11
00:01:01,605 --> 00:01:04,023
Cool. Cool.

12
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:05,650
I have some questions.

13
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:06,651
Thought you might.

14
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:10,196
How did I die? I... I don't remember.
- Yes, um...

15
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:13,115
in cases of traumatic
or embarrassing deaths

16
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:17,119
we erase the memory,
to allow for a peaceful transition.

17
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:18,913
Are you sure you want to hear?

18
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,708
All right, so you were
in a grocery store parking lot.

19
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:24,752
You dropped a bottle
of something called

20
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:27,922
"Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One"

21
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:32,301
and when you bent down to pick it up,
a long column of shopping carts

22
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,346
that were being returned
to the shopping cart collection area

23
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:38,849
rolled out of control
and ploughed right into you.

24
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:41,352
"Oof."
That's how I died.

25
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,562
No, sorry, there's more.

26
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:45,731
Well, you were able to grab onto the front
of the column of shopping carts

27
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:49,694
but it swept you right out into the street,
where you were struck and killed

28
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:55,575
by a mobile billboard truck
advertising an erectile dysfunction pill

29
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:57,159
called "Engorge-ulate."

30
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:01,080
Funnily enough, the first "EMT"
to arrive was an ex-boyfriend of yours.

31
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:03,624
Okay. That's... I get it. Thank you.
- Okay, sorry.

32
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:06,085
Um, so who was right?

33
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:08,838
I mean about all of this?

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,714
Well, let's see.

35
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:13,301
Hindus are a little bit right,
Muslims a little bit

36
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:18,931
Jews, Christians, Buddhists -
every religion guessed about five percent.

37
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:20,850
Except for Doug Forcett.

38
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:22,393
Who... who is Doug Forcett?

39
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,315
Well, Doug was a stoner kid
who lived in Calgary during the 1970s.

40
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:31,611
One night he got really high on mushrooms,
and his best friend Randy said

41
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:34,572
"Hey, what do you think happens
after we die?"

42
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:38,200
And Doug just launched
into this long monologue

43
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:40,870
where he got
like ninety-two percent correct.

44
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:41,787
I mean

45
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,539
we couldn't believe
what we were hearing.

46
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:45,082
That's him, actually,
right up there.

47
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:46,917
He's pretty famous around here.

48
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,628
I'm very lucky to have that.

49
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,213
So, maybe my biggest question.

50
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:53,799
Am I... I mean is this...

51
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,554
or... you know?

52
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:03,643
Well, it's not the "heaven" or "hell" idea
that you were raised on.

53
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:05,853
But generally speaking

54
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:10,858
in the afterlife, there's a Good Place,
and there's a Bad Place.

55
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,028
You' re in the Good Place.

56
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,155
- You're okay, Eleanor.

57
00:03:16,698 --> 00:03:18,074
You' re in the Good Place.

58
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,492
Well, that's good.

59
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,327
Sure is. Ha!

60
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,621
Okay. Let's take a walk, shall we?

61
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,458
Oh, did I have a purse?

62
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:30,211
No, I'm dead. Right. Okay.

63
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,385
So, are you...

64
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,553
I mean, this sounds
like a crazy question

65
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:41,097
but are you "God?"

66
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,848
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

67
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,017
There are many levels above me, Eleanor

68
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,687
before you get to the Supreme Commander

69
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:50,439
Zortraxx the Merciless Frog God

70
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:51,440
long may he reign.

71
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,694
I'm kidding.

72
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:56,445
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:58,698
No, no, no, no, no.
It's not a giant frog.

74
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,116
Oh. Whew.

75
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:01,534
No, it's just my little joke.

76
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:04,537
Um, seriously, though.
I'm... I'm not a god.

77
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:09,083
Eleanor, I'm... I'm an architect,
and I designed this Neighbourhood.

78
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:10,710
So this is how it works.

79
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:13,921
The Good Place is divided
into distinct "Neighbourhoods."

80
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:17,675
Each one contains exactly
three hundred and twenty-two people

81
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:23,597
who have been perfectly selected to blend
together into a blissful harmonic balance.

82
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,891
Do all the neighbourhoods look like this?

83
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,435
No - every neighbourhood is unique.

84
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:31,689
Some have warm weather, some cold,
some are cities, some farmland.

85
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:36,068
But in each one
every blade of grass, every ladybug

86
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:41,407
every detail has been precisely designed
and calibrated for its residents.

87
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:43,951
There's a lot of frozen yoghurt places.

88
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:47,246
Yeah. That's the one thing we put
in all the neighbourhoods.

89
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:48,998
People love frozen yoghurt.

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,416
I don't know what to tell you.

91
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:53,794
You're going to have
a million more questions, I know.

92
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,297
For right now,
you better grab a seat.

93
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:57,798
Movie's about to begin.

94
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:10,561
Hello, everyone, and welcome
to your first day in the afterlife!

95
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:14,523
You were all simply-put: good people.

96
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,817
But how do we know
that you were good?

97
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,985
How are we sure?

98
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:22,573
During your time on Earth,
every one of your actions

99
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,074
had a positive...

100
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:25,618
or a negative value...

101
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,037
depending on how much good or bad

102
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,623
that action put into the universe.

103
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:34,835
Every sandwich you ate,
every time you bought a magazine

104
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:40,508
every single thing you did
had an effect that rippled out over time

105
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,677
and ultimately created
some amount of good or bad.

106
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:46,430
You know how some people
pull into the breakdown lane

107
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,599
when there's traffic,
and they think to themselves

108
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:50,810
"Ah, who cares? No one's watching."

109
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:53,646
We were watching. Surprise.

110
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:58,025
Anyway, when your time on Earth has ended

111
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:01,070
we calculate the total value of your life

112
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:04,198
using our perfectly accurate
measuring system.

113
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,409
Only the people
with the very highest scores -

114
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:08,953
the true cream of the crop -

115
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,996
get to come here, to The Good Place!

116
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,082
What happens to everyone else,
you ask?

117
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,084
Don't worry about it.

118
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:17,753
The point is:
you are here because you lived

119
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:20,756
one of the very best lives
that could be lived.

120
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:25,761
And you won't be alone!
Your true soulmate is here too!

121
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:28,597
That's right - soulmates are real.

122
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:33,435
One of the other people in your neighbourhood
is your actual soulmate

123
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:35,938
and you will spend eternity together!

124
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,733
So welcome to eternal happiness.

125
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,069
Welcome to The Good Place.

126
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:45,573
Sponsored by otters holding hands
while they sleep.

127
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,116
- Aw!
- You know the way you feel

128
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,827
when you see
a picture of two otters holding hands?

129
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:53,080
That's how you're going to feel every day.

130
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,961
So, who is in The Bad Place
that would shock me?

131
00:06:59,004 --> 00:06:59,879
Ah...

132
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:05,009
well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis,
basically, every artist, ever.

133
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,553
Uh... every US President
except Lincoln.

134
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:08,554
That sounds about right.

135
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:10,389
Walt Disney.
- Really?

136
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,515
Oh, yeah, yeah.

137
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:13,142
They went to town on Disney.

138
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:17,438
He has to spend eternity
in a broken down boat

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,983
on the "Small World" ride
with eight very tired children

140
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,611
and they made it so he really has to pee.

141
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,321
What about Florence Nightingale?

142
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,114
That was close but no,
she didn't make it.

143
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:30,326
Wow, all those amazing people
down there.

144
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,036
It just seems so hard to believe.

145
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:35,456
Again, it's an incredibly selective system.

146
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,333
Most people don't make it here.

147
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:41,921
But you: a lawyer,
who got innocent people off death row.

148
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,797
You're special, Eleanor.

149
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:45,966
And by the way...

150
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,928
welcome to your new home.

151
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,013
Ah! It's perfect, isn't it?

152
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,058
You see, in The Good Place
every person gets to live

153
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,728
in a home that perfectly matches
his or her true essence.

154
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:59,271
Cool.

155
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:04,610
So, I guess that's why my house,
for example, is this adorable little cottage

156
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:07,488
whereas other people
might have homes that are bigger

157
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:09,281
like that one.

158
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:10,991
Exactly.

159
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:12,576
Ah, I'm so happy you get it.

160
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:17,289
As you can see, the interior
has been decorated just as you like it

161
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:20,084
in the "Icelandic primitive" style.

162
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:25,130
Oh, oh! And, uh... of course,
you love clowns, so...

163
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,967
I do love clowns.

164
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:31,303
Now, let me show you the, uh...
the video system here.

165
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:37,935
You can review everything that happened
in your life from your point of view.

166
00:08:38,895 --> 00:08:39,979
There we go.

167
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:42,731
This is your Human Rights mission
to Ukraine.

168
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:46,735
I mean, you got a ton of points for that one.
It really put you over the top.

169
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:48,862
Oh.

170
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:50,906
Chidi! Come on in.

171
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,703
Eleanor? I'm Chidi Anagonye.

172
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:58,288
And you are my soulmate.

173
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,501
Cool. Bring it in, man.

174
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:05,963
Now, excuse me.
I have other people to attend to.

175
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,173
So, where are you from, Chidi?

176
00:09:08,425 --> 00:09:11,927
Well, I was born in Nigeria,
raised in Senegal.

177
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,096
But my work took me
all over the place -

178
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,432
Australia, Hong Kong, Paris...

179
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,975
What about you?

180
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:21,979
I was born in Phoenix, Arizona.

181
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:25,232
Then I went to school in Tempe, Arizona.

182
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:28,736
And then I moved back to Phoenix, Arizona.

183
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,281
Your English is amazing.

184
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:33,615
Oh!

185
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:36,076
I'm actually speaking French.

186
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,953
This place just translates whatever you say

187
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:40,164
into a language
the other person can understand.

188
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,832
So, it's incredible!
- Whoa.

189
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,960
And now I want to say this...
- Okay.

190
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:46,503
Eleanor.

191
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:52,217
I have spent my entire life in pursuit
of fundamental truths about the universe

192
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,014
and now we can actually learn about them,
together, as soulmates.

193
00:09:58,433 --> 00:09:59,600
It's overwhelming!

194
00:10:01,603 --> 00:10:05,314
Chidi? You'll stand by my side
no matter what, right?

195
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:07,107
Of course, I will.

196
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,738
Promise me. Say "I promise
I will never betray you for any reason."

197
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:15,824
Eleanor, I swear that I will never say

198
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:20,037
or do anything to cause you any harm.

199
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:21,330
Good.

200
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:24,041
Because those aren't my memories.
I wasn't a lawyer.

201
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,794
I never went to the Ukraine.
I hate clowns.

202
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,546
There's been a big mistake.

203
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,549
I'm not supposed to be here.

204
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:37,763
Wait, what?

205
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:48,690
Are you sure this isn't you?

206
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:52,319
Yeah, man, I'm pretty sure
I wasn't a death row lawyer

207
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:55,864
who collected clown paintings
and rescued orphans.

208
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,075
They got my name right,
but nothing else.

209
00:10:58,118 --> 00:11:00,661
I mean somebody royally forked up.

210
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:02,913
Somebody forked up.

211
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:05,415
Why can't I say fork?

212
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,501
If you're trying to curse,
you can't here.

213
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:09,503
I guess a lot of people
in this neighbourhood don't like it

214
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:11,338
so it's prohibited.
- That's "bullshirt."

215
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:15,509
So, uh... if you're not this person
then who are you?

216
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:16,635
What did you do for a living?

217
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:20,681
I was in sales.

218
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:22,599
So, we sell two products here.

219
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:25,352
"NasaPro, " and "NasaPro Silver,"
we aim this at seniors.

220
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:30,732
Now, you can't legally call it "medicine,"
because it doesn't technically "work"

221
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,819
and it is, technically, chalk.

222
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,238
So, what you're gonna want to do...
- You need me to lie to old people

223
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,990
and scare them into buying fake medicine.

224
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:38,949
I get it, man.

225
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:40,075
Which one's my desk?

226
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:45,289
So your job was to defraud the elderly.

227
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,666
Sorry - the sick and elderly.

228
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:48,917
But I was very good at it.

229
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:51,295
I was the top salesperson
five years running.

230
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:52,546
Okay, but that's worse.

231
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,965
I mean you... you do get
how that's worse

232
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:56,425
right?
- Mmm.

233
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,846
You know, maybe it's a test.

234
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,682
Maybe, if you go to Michael
then you tell him the truth

235
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,185
you' II pass the test,
and you'll get to stay.

236
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:08,729
No way,
I can't risk going to The Bad Place.

237
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,773
Okay, well, maybe it's not actually
like all that bad.

238
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,859
Let's just get some information first.

239
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:15,402
We'll ask Janet. Hey, Janet?

240
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:16,445
Hi, there.
- Argh!

241
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,322
How can I help you?
- What the fork?

242
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,032
Who are you?
- I'm Janet.

243
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:23,035
I'm the informational assistant here
in The Good Place.

244
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,495
She's like this walking database.

245
00:12:25,538 --> 00:12:29,249
You can ask her about the creation
of the universe, or history, or...

246
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,503
Oh, there was a guy who lived in Avondale,
Arizona, around 2002.

247
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,172
His name was Kevin Paltonic.

248
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:37,049
Is he gay?
- No.

249
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:38,091
Really?

250
00:12:38,927 --> 00:12:41,428
Huh. I guess he just didn't want
to have sex with me.

251
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:42,888
That's correct.
- Well, that's fine.

252
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:44,765
I wasn't that into him anyway.
- Yes, you were.

253
00:12:44,974 --> 00:12:46,600
Okay, Janet. I have a question.

254
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:49,770
Okay.
- What is The Bad Place like?

255
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:50,854
Oh, sorry.

256
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:53,857
That is the one topic
I'm not allowed to tell you about.

257
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:58,946
I can only play you a brief audio clip
of what is happening there right now.

258
00:12:58,988 --> 00:12:59,863
Okay.

259
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:02,282
Help me! Help me!

260
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:05,869
The bear has two mouths!

261
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:08,747
Well, it doesn't sound awesome.

262
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,710
Does everyone have
a huge house except me?

263
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,545
All right, we need a plan.

264
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:18,423
I say we just lie low
and hope that they don't notice me.

265
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,050
I'm sorry. I don't think I can help you.

266
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,677
I just don't like being dishonest

267
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:25,013
and I can't advise you
to be dishonest either.

268
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:27,516
Come on!
I'm just asking you to fudge a little bit.

269
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,977
You must have told
a few white lies in your life.

270
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,270
I mean what was your job?

271
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,273
I was a professor of Ethics
and Moral Philosophy.

272
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,233
Mother forker!

273
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm getting a stomach ache.

274
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,030
I'm in a perfect Utopia
and I have a stomach ache.

275
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:45,659
This is awful. I, uh...
I think I have to tell Michael about this.

276
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:46,868
Tell Michael about what?

277
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:48,954
Michael! Hi!

278
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,914
What have you been up to?

279
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:54,710
Oh, you know, just settling everyone
into eternal paradise.

280
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,211
Sure, sure.

281
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:59,756
Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you
to meet Tahani and Jianyu.

282
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:02,968
They are soulmates
and your nextdoor neighbours.

283
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:07,055
Hello. Can I just say, I love your house.

284
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:10,434
It's just so tiny and cute.

285
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,227
It's like a little child's plaything!

286
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,230
It's a bit like one
of those tinker toy houses, isn't it?

287
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:18,859
Like for a family of mice,
or for a very fancy little dog!

288
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:22,571
I love it.
It's just so sweet and teensy.

289
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:24,406
Just like you.

290
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,407
Boop!
- Ooh!

291
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,409
Oh!
- You "booped" me.

292
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:28,660
I did.

293
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:30,579
That's fun.
- Oh, I tell ya.

294
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,248
The thought of you four amazing people

295
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,792
living next to each other
for eternity just...

296
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:37,544
it brings joy to my heart.

297
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:39,504
Oh, I almost forgot.

298
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,841
Tahani and Jianyu are having
a little "welcome party" tonight

299
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:45,135
and they've invited
the entire neighbourhood.

300
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:48,388
Is that because your house
is so big it can fit everybody?

301
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,556
Exactly, yes.

302
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,017
But also
because I simply adore entertaining.

303
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,227
I just adore it.

304
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,229
Don't I just adore it, Jianyu?

305
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:57,939
Oh, um... yes.

306
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:01,568
By the way, Jianyu, here,
is a Buddhist monk, you see

307
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:04,321
and he obeys
a strict code of silence.

308
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:06,782
So when you see him smiling
and nodding

309
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:10,118
that's actually his way of jumping up
and down with glee!

310
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,244
Isn't that right, darling?

311
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:14,706
So, we'll see you tonight.

312
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:15,999
Great.
- Yes.

313
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,420
This is a sweet dress, right?

314
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,214
Yeah.
- I had Janet fetch it for me.

315
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,257
Instant, on demand, everything free.

316
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,801
This place is the best.

317
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:30,389
No way.

318
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,892
My entire house could fit in this room.

319
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,020
Okay, uh... help me out here.

320
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:40,148
Tell me one good thing
that you did on Earth.

321
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:43,777
Just one truly kind and decent act

322
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,446
so that I can feel better
about helping you out.

323
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:50,742
Let's forget about good.

324
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:52,869
Um... just tell me
something neutral about yourself.

325
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,788
Like, tell me about the day
before you died.

326
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:55,705
What do you remember?

327
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:58,792
Hi, there.

328
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,293
Do you have a second
to talk about the environment?

329
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,087
Do you have a second
to eat my farts?

330
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:04,881
You missed.
- Pfft! Pick it up

331
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:06,341
if you're so horny
for the environment.

332
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,177
I don't remember anything specific.

333
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:10,554
Oh.
- Look

334
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:14,141
I might not have been a saint,
but it's not like I killed anybody.

335
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:15,392
I wasn't an arsonist.

336
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:18,728
I never found a wallet outside of an IHOP
and thought about returning it

337
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,021
but saw the owner lived out of state

338
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,482
so just took the cash and dropped
the wallet back on the ground.

339
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,317
Okay, that's really specific

340
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,153
and that makes me think
that you definitely did do that.

341
00:16:26,195 --> 00:16:30,782
All I'm saying is,
these people might be "good"

342
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,993
but are they really
that much better than me?

343
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:38,248
Well, I spent half my life in North Korea
fighting for women's rights

344
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,209
and the other half in Saudi Arabia
fighting for gay rights.

345
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:44,421
So we said, "If the UN won't remove
those landmines, we will."

346
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,549
And we dug up
over a thousand unexploded landmines

347
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,342
from the area surrounding
the orphanage.

348
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,260
Well, then he said

349
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,345
"You can't give me both your kidneys,
you'll die."

350
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,598
What?
- I said, "But you will live

351
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,558
and I know we just met
on this bus ten minutes ago

352
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:57,809
but you seem nice."

353
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,978
Forget it. Heading to the bar.

354
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:07,569
Hey, Janet?
- Hi. How can I help?

355
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,533
I've had eight glasses of wine
and I don't feel anything.

356
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:16,244
Um, can we not get drunk here?

357
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,372
It's suddenly very important
that I get drunk.

358
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:22,959
Our default setting
is that alcohol has no effect.

359
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:26,546
If you want it to affect you,
all you have to do is think to yourself...

360
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,631
Got it. On it.

361
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:41,478
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:45,899
I promise I won't take up
too much time here.

363
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:49,819
As Shakespeare once said,
"Brevity is the soul of wit."

364
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:51,780
Although, he's actually...

365
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:53,949
Oop! So...

366
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,617
We can ignore that advice.

367
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,538
You all know that I am the architect
of this neighbourhood

368
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:01,331
but what you don't know is...

369
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,334
golly, I'm not supposed
to tell you this but, um...

370
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:06,002
oh, what the heck?

371
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:10,674
This is actually the very first neighbourhood
that I have ever designed.

372
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,969
I have been an apprentice
for over two hundred years

373
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:18,431
and my boss has finally given me
my first solo project!

374
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:19,933
Aw.

375
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:22,352
Yes!

376
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,813
Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah!
Hold on there, ace.

377
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:26,565
Let me get more of them "shrampies."

378
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:27,482
Easy.

379
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,359
What?
They're for everybody, right?

380
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:30,485
Yes. Exactly.

381
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,655
and you deserve a perfect world.

382
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:36,658
Because every single one of you

383
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:38,577
is a good person.

384
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,621
That's it for me.
Back to you, Tahani.

385
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,456
Bravo, Michael!
- Thank you.

386
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:44,541
Bravo!

387
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:47,043
Um, and I would just like
to quickly say

388
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:49,254
if any of you would like
to play tennis tonight

389
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:52,966
we have thirty-six
regulation grass tennis courts.

390
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,593
Such fun! Cheers!

391
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,180
Tahani - what a condescending bench.

392
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:00,640
Okay, okay.
- Am I right?

393
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,726
Why does she still have
that British accent? Right?

394
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:03,852
No one else here has an accent.

395
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:05,812
She's choosing to have that accent.

396
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,857
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- "Ooh, hello!

397
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:13,194
I am just a big beautiful
utterly perfect cartoon giraffe!"

398
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,446
Oh, okay, okay.

399
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,823
I think it's time to go home.

400
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,492
Wait, wait, wait,
I just have to go upstairs real quick

401
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,411
and steal a bunch of gold stuff.

402
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:22,454
Okay, don't do that.

403
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,374
Don't do... no!
Eleanor. Eleanor. Eleanor.

404
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,338
Hello, creepy house that I hate!

405
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:34,341
Hello, one million clowns!

406
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,886
Why aren't there stairs here?

407
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:43,224
Ugh! What kind of weirdo house is this?

408
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,435
Ooh.

409
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:49,230
Did you fill your bra with shrimp?

410
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,940
No.

411
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:52,609
Yes.

412
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:57,447
Whatever, it's freakin' heaven,
I'm sure they have plenty of shellfish.

413
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,991
That Tahani is a real butthead, huh?

414
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,159
Hey!

415
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:03,370
At least I can still say "butthead."

416
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,664
Ugh, she is a butthead.

417
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:07,624
Found some pyjamas.

418
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,461
Chidi? Chidi? Chidi?

419
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,048
I'm sorry
that you had to deal with this.

420
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:18,551
It's okay.
- It's not, though.

421
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,347
Do you think
anybody cared that I died?

422
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,349
Maybe someone did.

423
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,394
I don't know. I was an only child.

424
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:29,813
My parents were divorced
when I was a kid.

425
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,815
They were both crummy people

426
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,525
so they're probably...

427
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,151
in The Bad Place.

428
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,279
Maybe they're being used
to torture each other.

429
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:41,241
It would work.

430
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,411
I bet way more people cared
that you died.

431
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,122
Because you're a nice person.

432
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,208
You're a nice person.

433
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:52,961
Chidi Anaconda.

434
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,257
Anagonye.
- "Aginoncamunga."

435
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,676
Anagonye.
- "Ag..." - say it again.

436
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:01,720
Anagonye.
- No, say what you said before.

437
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,221
I did. It's Anagonye.

438
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:05,140
You just changed it.
- I didn't change it.

439
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,809
It's my name.
- "Aragugronde," Ariana Grande!

440
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,227
That's a person.

441
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:10,437
I did it!

442
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,272
Good night.

443
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,400
Good night.

444
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,076
Well, that's terrifying.

445
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:39,299
Thirty glasses of wine and no hangover.

446
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:42,927
This place rules.

447
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,312

Is that giant, terrifying ladybug
supposed to be there?

458
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:20,632
Ah! Well, great question, Tahani.

459
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,926
No. No, it's not.

460
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,262

is happening or how to control it.

470
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:53,248
What's going on?

471
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:55,375
Why are there giant animals everywhere?

472
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:57,335
Do you hear Ariana Grande playing?

473
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:00,463
Why is everyone
wearing blue and yellow?

474
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:02,549
You're not.

475
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:05,510
You're...
you're the only one who's not.

476
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:08,721
Eleanor, this is all happening
because of you.

477
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,307
Ah, fork me!

478
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:17,105
Okay, okay, we don't know
this is because of me.

479
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,022
Eleanor.

480
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:22,110
This place is a perfectly made Swiss watch,
and you are a wrench in the gears.

481
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,446
Actually, you' re a hammer,
just smashing the gears into dust.

482
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,447
Oh, hang on.

483
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,491
Not everybody here is perfect, okay?

484
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:32,537
Tahani is totally condescending
and there are a couple of, you know...

485
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:35,290
"chunksters."
- Oh, come on!

486
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:38,960
No judgment, I'm just saying
I'm not the only one with flaws

487
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,546
so how can we be sure
this is my fault?

488
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:44,757
You hogged all the shrimp,
and now there are shrimp flying around.

489
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:48,386
You called Tahani a giraffe,
and now there are giraffes everywhere.

490
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:50,889
Okay, fine. Turns out there are
many ways to know that it was me.

491
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,098
Let's just face it, Eleanor.

492
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:53,141
You don't belong here.

493
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,854
Well, then this system sucks.

494
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,024
What, one in a million
gets to live in paradise

495
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,027
and everyone else is tortured for eternity?
Come on!

496
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:07,697
I mean I wasn't freakin' Gandhi,
but I was okay.

497
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:10,491
I was a medium person.

498
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:15,538
I should get to spend eternity
in a medium place, like Cincinnati.

499
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,916
Everyone who wasn't perfect,
but wasn't terrible

500
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,126
should get to spend eternity in Cincinnati.

501
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,086
Look, apparently it doesn't work that way.

502
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,007
I'm sorry, Eleanor,
but there's nothing anyone can do.

503
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:32,013
Unless there is something we can do.

504
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:34,349
Unless you could teach me.

505
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,184
Teach you what?

506
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,477
How to be good!

507
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,187
That was your job, right?

508
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:40,939
A professor of Ethics?

509
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,316
No one knew I was a problem
when I arrived.

510
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:45,151
Things only started getting crazy

511
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:47,362
after I was an ash-hole
to everyone at the party.

512
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:48,279
Ugh!

513
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:51,991
You know I'm trying to say "ash-hole,"
and not "ash-hole, " right?

514
00:24:52,034 --> 00:24:53,159
I got that, yes.
- Okay.

515
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:54,327
Give me a chance.

516
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:56,746
Let me earn my place here.

517
00:24:57,081 --> 00:25:00,083
You spent your life wondering
what makes someone good or bad.

518
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:03,127
Now you have the perfect test case.

519
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:05,213
Let me be your ethical guinea pig!

520
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,382
Hey, guys!

521
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,842
Uh... Emergency
neighbourhood meeting! Now!

522
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,302
We'll be right there, Michael.

523
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:14,472
If I walk out of here in these clothes,
I'm toast.

524
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,724
My soul is in your hands, soulmate.

525
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,226
What's it gonna be?

526
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,815
Oh! Stomach ache.
