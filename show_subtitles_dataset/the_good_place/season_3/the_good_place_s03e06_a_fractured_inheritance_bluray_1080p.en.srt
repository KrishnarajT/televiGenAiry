1
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,595
OK, OK, OK. Let's do
sophomore year of high school.

2
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:06,842
Uh, Nathan Burlingame.

3
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:08,594
- Didn't like you.
- Huh.

4
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,092
Kylie Mansard?

5
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:11,760
Thought you were cool
but intimidating.

6
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:14,722
No way! I thought
she was intimidating!

7
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,681
That's why I shoved her into that creek.

8
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:22,067
Well, after my chilli episode, I asked
the administration for a one-year sabbatical

9
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:23,114
and good news.

10
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,523
They fired me!

11
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:28,242
So, I am free and easy.

12
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:31,746
Well, the rest of the Soul Squad
is off helping Jason's dad.

13
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:32,832
Who are we saving?

14
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,834
No one from my high school,
I will tell you that much.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,164
Well, before we do anything,
I have to break things off with Simone.

16
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,633
If I slip up and tell her about the universe,
it could doom her for eternity.

17
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,212
And I've avoided talking to her for so long,
she assumed I had laryngitis

18
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,506
and it went too far,
and now I'm on antibiotics!

19
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:52,972
OK, settle down.
Your moral code means you can't lie, right?

20
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,145
You need to just ghost her.

21
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,063
Disappear, block her number.

22
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,684
Bonus, anything she left in your apartment
now legally belongs to you.

23
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:03,441
I've done that to dozens of people,
and all of them got over it.

24
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,651
Actually, none of your exes
have ever gotten over you.

25
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:06,983
You're damn right they didn't.

26
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:11,198
I just wish I could end things
in a way that I knew wouldn't hurt her.

27
00:01:11,497 --> 00:01:12,704
Bing!

28
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,871
I usually appear out of thin air
and there would be a pleasant "bing" sound

29
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:20,287
but I don't have my powers
so I'm doing my own "bings" now.

30
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:21,631
Bing!

31
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,755
Chidi, what if I could create
a virtual reality simulation

32
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:27,739
where you could practice
different break-up scenarios?

33
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:29,425
- You can do that?
- I think so.

34
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:33,176
I do know everything about you, and Simone,
and computer programming

35
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,184
and virtual reality
and artificial intelligence

36
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,891
and the human brain and everything else.

37
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:40,436
I'm kind of a nerd.
I'll start building the simulator now.

38
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:41,818
Bing!

39
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:46,573
Don't...

40
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:48,032
Turn around.

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,740
It's embarrassing.

42
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,078
Bing!

43
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,960
Jacksonville! What up!

44
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:06,375
Duval!

45
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,297
Duval!

46
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:09,507
Poor Larry.

47
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:11,514
But...

48
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:14,765
"If you love someone, set them free."

49
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:19,100
My good friend and yoga pupil Sting,
no last initial, told me that.

50
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,016
I can't wait to show you guys
all the cool sights in Jacksonville.

51
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:25,310
Like, that swamp is where me,
Pillboi and Donkey Doug

52
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:28,196
used to stand and try and blind pilots
with laser pointers.

53
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,070
- And, oh...
- Maybe we should do the tour after we...

54
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:33,569
you know, save your father's soul.

55
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:36,951
Oh, I've been meaning to ask,
why are you trying to save your father?

56
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,167
I've heard you mention your friend Pillboi
many times

57
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,932
but you've not mentioned your father once.

58
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:45,372
What do you mean?
I talk about Donkey Doug all the time.

59
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,011
I'm sorry...

60
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:53,593
the man you call "Donkey Doug"
is your father?

61
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:54,891
Yeah.

62
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:59,561
The "Donkey Doug" with whom you tried
to blind airline pilots with laser pointers?

63
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,563
Yeah.

64
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:03,022
The "Donkey Doug" who is banned
from Disney World

65
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,024
for biting Buzz Lightyear?

66
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,978
In his defence,
he thought it was someone else.

67
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,406
Who?

68
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,609
So, Michael and I have a plan
to save my dad.

69
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:16,821
My whole life,
Donkey Doug was always getting in trouble

70
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:19,239
because of some get-rich-quick scheme.

71
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,162
He sold counterfeit truck nutz

72
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,794
he created a sport that was a cross between
dodgeball and horseshoes

73
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,329
and everybody died.

74
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:27,959
- He glued...
- This should be easy.

75
00:03:28,092 --> 00:03:29,754
We have plenty of money.

76
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:34,588
If we just give him money, he'll blow it.
He's gotta feel like he did it himself.

77
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:38,888
A few years ago, Donkey Doug was very close
to getting his electrician's licence.

78
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:42,600
So, if we get him to finish the training,
he can earn an honest living

79
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,273
and be on his way to getting more
Good Place points

80
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,479
which is why we're all here.

81
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,233
OK, let's go save ma dad!

82
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,155
Taxi!

83
00:03:57,788 --> 00:03:59,700
- Ha!
- Need help with your bag?

84
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,790
Nah, I got it!

85
00:04:04,086 --> 00:04:05,702
Oh, dip! Jason!

86
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:07,162
Aw, dip! Donkey Doug!

87
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,960
You call him "Donkey Doug" in person?

88
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,461
Me and Jason are cool like that.

89
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:15,466
I don't think of him as my son,
I think of him as ma boy!

90
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:18,014
I mean, I am ya boy.

91
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,432
Yeah, but it's more like...

92
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,430
"That's my son right there, son!"

93
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,231
But not, like, "son-son", but, like,
"ma boy". But not, like...

94
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,354
Yes, Yes, we get it. Thank you.

95
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,064
Oh, this is my friend, Michael.

96
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:32,319
Aw, crap! You look like a cop!

97
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,240
Are you a cop? Because if you are,
you have to tell me

98
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,512
and you're not allowed to arrest me
for anything you saw

99
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:39,152
before I knew you were a cop.

100
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:42,031
- I'm not a police officer.
- Yeah, Michael's cool.

101
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,500
And this is Tahani, who is my wife, I guess.

102
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,327
Dang, nice pull, son!

103
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:51,255
How about you and me go check out my Jacuzzi
and put stuff in each other?

104
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:53,379
Again, I'm his wife.

105
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:54,469
Wow.

106
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,969
That's the first time that line
has ever failed.

107
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,922
You must really love him.

108
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,141
Welcome to the family! Come on in!

109
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:04,970
This programme knows everything
about your personality

110
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:07,556
Simone's personality,
and all human relationships.

111
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:11,818
It can't tell you exactly what will happen,
but it will approximate Simone's reaction

112
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,103
to anything you say to her.

113
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:15,397
Plus... it has Tetris!

114
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:18,984
Hm. Would this work with, say, me,
and, say...

115
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:21,946
uh, Jason Statham, and uh,
instead of a cafÃ©

116
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,749
it was, say, a room with a futon
and a bunch of Red Bull?

117
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,042
Why is it that every time a new thing
is invented

118
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,704
humans immediately try to use it for porn?

119
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,000
Because we're disgusting.

120
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:34,462
Huh. Eleanor and I
will be watching on the monitor.

121
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,543
We'll see what you see.
Put these in your ears.

122
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:39,755
They'll play a tone that will trick
your brain into seeing what I've programmed.

123
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:48,521
Wow! Uh, so, this is... I'm here.

124
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,649
Hey, babe.

125
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:51,725
What did you wanna talk about?

126
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,422
Go ahead, Chidi.
Practice what you want to say to her.

127
00:05:54,446 --> 00:05:58,065
Right, um... Simone, this has been
the best year of my life

128
00:05:58,242 --> 00:05:59,403
because of you.

129
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,952
Unfortunately,
I have come to learn some information

130
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:07,408
and it means that we have to end
this relationship.

131
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:10,790
- What information?
- I can't say.

132
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,540
- Why not?
- Uh...

133
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,130
I-I can't say.

134
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:16,708
Well, you've either gone crazy
or you're too much of a coward

135
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,003
- to tell me how you feel. Which is it?
- I-I can't, because of...

136
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,172
Janet!

137
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,666
Who's Janet? And why are you screaming
her name into the sky?

138
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,676
You know what... whatever.
Goodbye, Chidi.

139
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,851
No, no, no, wait!

140
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,305
So!

141
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,183
- That didn't go great.
- I disagree!

142
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,101
I thought it was hilarious.

143
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:36,773
So, Donkey Doug...

144
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:41,741
Jason told us about your electrician licence,
and we have a career opportunity for you.

145
00:06:41,827 --> 00:06:43,534
Yo! Later for that.

146
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:46,530
I got a business proposition for you.

147
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,206
Pillboi!

148
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,251
- Oh, dip! Jason!
- Oh, dip! Pillboi!

149
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:54,709
- Oh, dip! Pillboi!
- Oh, dip! Donkey Doug!

150
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,957
This is remarkable.

151
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,417
It explains so much.

152
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,802
Jason, I thought you were dead!

153
00:07:00,846 --> 00:07:04,430
But I was alive! I was in Australia.
I talked to you on the phone last week!

154
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,007
Yeah, but I forgot!

155
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,101
Oh...!

156
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:10,930
Me and Pillboi have been cooking up
something real special.

157
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:13,686
And this time, it's not fake meth.

158
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:18,232
Alright, Pillboi,
tell him about our new product!

159
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:22,987
Sharks, how much do you spend on
energy drinks and body spray in one week?

160
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,324
$300?

161
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,785
Ten hundred dollars?

162
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:29,952
What if I told you there was a product
that combined these two things

163
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:34,457
for one solution to all of life's problems
and more?

164
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:37,421
I give to you, "Double Trouble."

165
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:41,092
The world's first
energy drink-slash-body spray.

166
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,880
So, uh, do you spray it on yourself
or do you drink it?

167
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,051
You both it!

168
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,475
This is the one, Jason!
We're gonna be so rich.

169
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:53,646
I'll finally be able to pay to have
my calf implants moved back up from my feet!

170
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:55,864
This is gonna be a lot tougher
than we thought.

171
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:58,859
Tell me about it.
"Double Trouble" sounds amazing!

172
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,814
We should bid fast,
the other Sharks are gonna want in.

173
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,240
So, I just have to be simple, honest,
and declarative

174
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,617
and somehow still protect her feelings.

175
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,666
I don't know, man.

176
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,830
- Maybe just tell her that you're gay.
- I'm not gay.

177
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,163
Fine, bi.

178
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,961
- I'm not bi either.
- Why not?

179
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:21,291
More guys should be bi.
It's 2018, it's like, get over yourselves!

180
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:25,379
Is there any way I can try
a bunch of different things in a row

181
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,546
to see what works?

182
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Bing! Sure.

183
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,678
If you want to reset,
just snap your fingers.

184
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:33,682
Also, I made some modifications to the tone,
so it should make your transition easier.

185
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:34,772
Oh.

186
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:42,733
Hey, babe.

187
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:45,051
What did you want to talk about?

188
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:47,192
Well, I don't love you anymore.

189
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:48,287
What?

190
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,824
No, no, you don't understand.

191
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:56,034
I don't technically love you in the same way,
because of circumstances.

192
00:08:56,795 --> 00:08:57,795
What?

193
00:08:58,255 --> 00:08:59,255
Hang on.

194
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,926
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I'm dying.

195
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:06,924
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

196
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:10,135
Because we're all dying, slowly,
when you think about it.

197
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,931
We start dying the moment we're born,
so, not a lie.

198
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:18,310
OK, here it is.

199
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,232
I'm just going to be perfectly honest.

200
00:09:21,236 --> 00:09:24,274
My real name
is Special Agent Rick Justice, FBI.

201
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:26,407
Nope.

202
00:09:28,577 --> 00:09:29,577
Simone...

203
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:35,991
the last year has been truly amazing.
And with that in mind...

204
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:40,457
Will you marry me?

205
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:41,505
Yes!

206
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,998
Yes, of course I will! Oh!

207
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:49,046
Wait, what-what am I doing?
Why did I think this would work?

208
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:51,034
Chidi, I'm gonna go ahead
and reboot this one myself.

209
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,058
Yeah, good call.

210
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:54,141
- So, Simone...
- Wait.

211
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:57,391
Before you say anything,
I think we should break up.

212
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:59,142
- You do?
- Yes.

213
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:02,810
I love and respect you very much,
but we're heading in different directions.

214
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:05,515
And don't worry, we don't have to make
a big "thing" of it.

215
00:10:05,614 --> 00:10:07,526
Oh, my God. OK. This is the one.

216
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,218
Remember everything,
right leg crossed over left.

217
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,323
Coffee's right there...

218
00:10:10,619 --> 00:10:11,619
Oh, one more thing.

219
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,907
Suck it, ya doink!

220
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,076
Sorry?

221
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,158
This is Eleanor, you idiot!

222
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,459
Janet let me mess with the simulator
to screw with you!

223
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:21,504
Janet, come on!

224
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:23,588
Hi, Chidi, this is Janet now.

225
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,461
- Sorry, it won't happen again.
- Thank you!

226
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,091
Psych! It's still Eleanor!

227
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:30,420
I can't believe you fell for that, ya doink!

228
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:32,139
We need to break up

229
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,507
but here's a puppy!

230
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,175
Aw! Wait, what?

231
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,057
He's a puppy, it's over between us,
and he's cute!

232
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:41,473
Do you think I don't hear the bad parts
of these sentences?

233
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,983
His name is Martin, I need my keys back,
and he's a puppy!

234
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,353
You are very bad at this.

235
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:49,634
Well, it's because I don't actually
want to break up with her!

236
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,615
What, do you need me to break up
with her for you

237
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,949
- like we're in middle school or something?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

238
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:57,405
- Please do that for me, please!
- Fine.

239
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,243
Hey, Eleanor!

240
00:11:01,586 --> 00:11:02,586
Hey.

241
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,336
What did you want to talk about?

242
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:07,757
Well, first of all,
you and Chidi are so great together.

243
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:10,589
He really loves you, and I can see why,
you know?

244
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,887
You're brilliant, charming,
obviously gorgeous.

245
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,589
Aww, you're sweet to say that.

246
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,179
- And your accent is so cute!
- Your accent is so cute.

247
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:19,514
What? I don't think I have an accent.

248
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,374
I don't think I have an accent.

249
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:23,685
Stopit!

250
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:33,358
What... is... happening?

251
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,787
Nope. No.

252
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:37,748
This is over.

253
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:40,287
Whoa, man, come on!
It was just getting good!

254
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,291
Let's remember the mission.

255
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:46,080
Your father needs to focus
on long-term stability.

256
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,505
Also, and perhaps this is less important

257
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:53,337
but there's an awful lot of dog hair
on the furniture, and I have not seen a dog.

258
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,088
Not bad, right?

259
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,641
"Double Trouble" comes in three
delicious smell-flavours.

260
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:02,012
Raspberry-Perspirant, Cedarwood Melon Blast

261
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:05,523
and 24-Hour Lemon Musk Xtreme.

262
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:07,984
That one is also a lube.

263
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,188
Look, Donkey Doug, "Double Trouble" is dope.

264
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:13,406
On that much, we can all agree on.

265
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,817
But you got to think long-term.

266
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,073
You were good at electricity stuff.

267
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:22,324
You hooked us up with free porno channels
every year, ever since the third grade.

268
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,749
It's good honest work.

269
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:25,747
"Honest work?" Whatever, Dad.

270
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:27,954
You're his dad.

271
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:30,297
This is huge, J!

272
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:34,423
When "Double Trouble" pops off, I'll be
able to quit my job at the old folks' home.

273
00:12:34,638 --> 00:12:36,254
Buy a big-ass mansion.

274
00:12:36,598 --> 00:12:39,966
Every day I'd wake up, get out of bed,
brush my teeth

275
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:43,186
rinse, go downstairs, open the fridge

276
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,308
Damn, we outta milk. Get in my car...

277
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,436
You don't have to run through
the whole imaginary day.

278
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:52,612
Jason, I believe in "Double Trouble."
Why won't you believe in me?

279
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:56,867
Well...

280
00:12:56,952 --> 00:13:00,741
I suppose a little entrepreneurial spirit
never hurt anyone.

281
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:05,124
You know, "Reach for the stars,"
as I said to my good friend Elon Musk.

282
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:07,827
And then he shot his car into space.

283
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,997
What a weird creep.
Why was I friends with him?

284
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:14,584
Maybe this is what'll put your father
on the right path.

285
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,678
And hey, it's not like he's robbing a bank.

286
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,718
Yeah. It's a factory!

287
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,017
Excuse me?

288
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:25,136
Tonight, we're gonna steal some energy drinks
from an energy drink factory

289
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,062
then steal some cologne
from a cologne factory

290
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,269
so, it's actually two factories.

291
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:31,609
Then we just gotta bottle it all up!

292
00:13:31,653 --> 00:13:33,940
Aw, dip, we gotta rob a bottle factory.

293
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:36,064
- Three factories.
- Three factories.

294
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,115
Stupid Donkey Doug!
I mean, two factories I can understand

295
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:42,199
but... but three?

296
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:47,826
You might want to consider the possibility
that your father's a lost cause.

297
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:51,371
I have an idea, but I need your help.

298
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:52,876
Will you guys help me?

299
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:57,044
I mean, yeah, that...
that's why we're here, Jason.

300
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,177
What's your idea, darling?

301
00:13:58,513 --> 00:14:00,755
We're gonna save Pillboi.

302
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,346
OK, real life. I think I'm ready.

303
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,012
I've analysed the ten
most successful scenarios

304
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:10,584
and compiled the statistically
most effective break-up strategy.

305
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,522
- Who said you weren't a romantic?
- Every girlfriend I've ever had.

306
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:15,899
Oh, there she is! OK, wish me luck.

307
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:22,322
Oh. Hi. Uh...

308
00:14:22,537 --> 00:14:23,573
Something wrong?

309
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,788
Er, no, it's just that
we're usually over there.

310
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,245
Doesn't matter.

311
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:34,798
OK, so I've spent a lot of time thinking
about everything that's happened

312
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,110
- in the last year...
- Hi there!

313
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:37,295
What can I get you to drink?

314
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:39,669
- Uh, I'll have an iced tea, please.
- Water, thanks.

315
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
Um...

316
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:44,591
It's been a time of massive personal
and professional growth...

317
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:47,135
- Sorry, sugar with that iced tea?
- Yes, please.

318
00:14:47,437 --> 00:14:50,145
Um, all in all,
it's been overwhelmingly positive

319
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,728
and I think that's due in large part to you.

320
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:56,065
Sorry, real quick. I'm gonna go on break,
so Helmut will be taking care of you.

321
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:59,026
Hello! Will you be eating with us today?

322
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:01,282
- Just, please, give us one second!
- Ja, OK.

323
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:04,785
One! That was one second.
Ha-ha, that was a joke!

324
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:06,661
- Please get out of here, Helmut!
- OK, ja.

325
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:09,077
Alright, look. Just, um,
we need to break up.

326
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:11,334
- I am... I am breaking up with you!
- Why?

327
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,995
I can't... It's... I ju...
It's... it's complicated.

328
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,206
But it's happening. Ya dumped!

329
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,671
- OK.
- Wait.

330
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:20,964
Wait, no...

331
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,720
Come back. Please.

332
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,300
Ja, OK, I'm back!

333
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,848
Not you, Helmut!

334
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:30,105
Hey.

335
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:34,190
Now listen, Judy. You can't mix Xannys
with these lil' pink fools.

336
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:38,106
You'll be tripping balls like Clarence was
when he crawled into the ice machine.

337
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,611
Here.

338
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:44,447
Take half of one of these,
wash it down with a five-hour energy

339
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:47,825
and you'll be golden.
Body high with mild visuals.

340
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,780
Thanks, Pillboi.

341
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,664
Yo, I gotta take off,
cos I gotta go do a robbery.

342
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,666
I mean... I'm sick.

343
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:02,339
Hello, Pillboi. I'm here on behalf of Jason.

344
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,881
You won't be attending the... job,
with Donkey Doug today.

345
00:16:06,975 --> 00:16:08,307
There's been a change of plans.

346
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,436
OK.

347
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:12,813
That's it?

348
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:15,348
You don't need any more information?

349
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:17,315
I mean, do you wanna tell me?

350
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:18,521
Not really.

351
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:19,695
Cool.

352
00:16:20,488 --> 00:16:21,649
Want some pills?

353
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:26,446
I hate this! What if I ruined her?

354
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:29,307
What if I sent her down the wrong path
and she ends up in the Bad Place?

355
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:32,074
I have to undo what I did.
Janet, fire up the simulator.

356
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:35,831
Dude! No more simulations,
just talk to her.

357
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,506
Break-ups never end with both people
feeling great, but she's a badass

358
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:43,710
and her world is bigger
than your relationship.

359
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,461
She'll recover.

360
00:16:45,764 --> 00:16:46,971
Just... Go.

361
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,847
Be a person.

362
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,476
Right.

363
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,311
Here I go.

364
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,557
Janet, can I use the simulator?

365
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,439
There's a very specific Lenny Kravitz
concert I wanna be front row at.

366
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:06,282
Sure. FYI, when the system boots up,
you might find yourself in a steam room

367
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:09,361
with Jason, who will be wearing
an old-timey strongman onesie.

368
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,741
It's a... bug in the system.

369
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:16,085
Pillboi?

370
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:17,793
No, it's me.

371
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:21,043
Pillboi's friend, Jason.
Pillboi's not coming.

372
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:24,175
If you're here to tell me an energy drink
body spray is a bad idea

373
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,421
I've heard it before.

374
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,253
From a bank, and some doctors.

375
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:31,720
I'mma help you make "Double Trouble" but
you gotta leave Pillboi alone from now on.

376
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,387
I'm trying to save him.

377
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:36,770
Oh, dip. You got religious
and shizz?

378
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,023
Amen.

379
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:39,608
Amen.

380
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:41,688
OK, hurry up and get this crap in my truck.

381
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,568
Jacksonville Police.
Come out with your hands up.

382
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:49,992
Are you a cop?
Cos if you are, you have to tell us!

383
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:52,578
Yes, this is the police.

384
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:55,372
- Yup, I knew it, it's the cops!
- Well, what do we do?

385
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,249
- Yo, let's get out of here.
- No.

386
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:01,166
I know I haven't been the best father
in the world.

387
00:18:01,506 --> 00:18:03,793
I might not have even been in the top five.

388
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,465
I wanna make up for that.
I'll distract 'em, you run out the back.

389
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,513
No, that's crazy.

390
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:12,222
It's what my dad did for me,
and his dad for him

391
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:15,802
and some day, you'll do this exact thing
for your son.

392
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:17,894
I mean, I hope not.

393
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,601
But thanks, Donkey Doug.

394
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:21,692
Hey.

395
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,359
- Call me "Donkey Dad".
- OK.

396
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:26,813
Donkey Dad.

397
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,907
Nah, that sounds wack! Call me Donkey Doug!

398
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,743
Cool.

399
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,495
Bortles!

400
00:18:46,176 --> 00:18:47,257
Uh...

401
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:51,549
Here's the truth. You're amazing.

402
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:55,140
And my feelings have changed.

403
00:18:55,185 --> 00:18:59,350
I wish I could tell you why,
I really, really do.

404
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:00,683
But...

405
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:03,683
I can't.

406
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:05,903
Well...

407
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:10,906
You seem to know what you want,
which is rare for you.

408
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:14,285
Well, I... I...
I hope you keep the study going.

409
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:17,784
It might help a lot of people.

410
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:20,292
Well.

411
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:22,785
- See you in the next life.
- What?

412
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:24,477
Why would you say that? What do you know?

413
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,588
It's a figure of speech.

414
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,007
You're so weird, man.

415
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,009
I think maybe this is for the best.

416
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:37,015
So, your covert mission is to continue
to report to this job

417
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,473
until you receive our signal.

418
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:42,096
Now, this is the most important thing.

419
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:45,267
You cannot commit any more crimes

420
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:50,063
and you must help these people
as much as you can.

421
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:52,189
The mission depends on it.

422
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:53,283
Roger that.

423
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:56,026
Man, I can't believe this whole time

424
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,949
you guys were with NASA!

425
00:19:58,206 --> 00:20:01,699
Yes, we are secret astronaut spies.

426
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,955
That is indeed what Jason told you.

427
00:20:05,296 --> 00:20:09,381
Take good care of these old fools,
and stay out of trouble.

428
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:11,712
I love you, bro.

429
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,506
I love you, bro.

430
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:24,972
- Psych!
- I got you, bro!

431
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,144
I got you, bro.

432
00:20:26,276 --> 00:20:27,276
- Jag...
- ... uars

433
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:28,277
Rule!

434
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:39,161
Well, my sister's museum exhibit
opens tomorrow.

435
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:42,615
Are you all ready for some Al-Jamil
family reconciliation?

436
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,709
You know it, wifey!

437
00:20:43,793 --> 00:20:45,159
Soul Squad is on a roll!

438
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:49,417
I pretty much nailed that Pillboi thing,
and I got closure with my dad, Donkey Doug.

439
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:52,755
That remains depressing.
But I'm happy for you, bud.

440
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:55,447
I never got to do that with my parents,
and now they're both dead

441
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,178
so it's impossible.

442
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,216
So, the thing is...

443
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:04,470
one of your parents is not technically,
actually...

444
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:05,981
dead.

445
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:07,459
What are you talking about?

446
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:11,318
Your mother's alive.
She faked her own death.

447
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:16,445
I'm sorry, Tahani, I don't think I'll be able
to stay with you here in Budapest.

448
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:21,078
Turns out my mum isn't dead,
so I need to fly back to America

449
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:23,071
to murder her.
