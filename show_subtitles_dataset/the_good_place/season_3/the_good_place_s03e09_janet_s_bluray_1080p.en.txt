- Hello!
- Hello.

9
00:01:37,923 --> 00:01:41,291
Hope we have the right house.
I'm looking for a Doug Forcett?

10
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:42,754
I'm Doug Forcett.

11
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:46,050
Wow! Oh, yes... yes, you are.

12
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,390
Sorry, um...

13
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,842
I'm a reporter
for the Calgary Times Examiner.

14
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:53,679
- Oh.
- My name is, uh, Michael Scoop.

15
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:57,269
- Mm-hm?
- This is my photographer, Janet... Scoop.

16
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,813
- She's my sister. We're the Scoops.
- Oh, boy.

17
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,901
Some... some people in town are saying
you live a pretty interesting life out here

18
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:06,407
growing your own food,
completely off the grid...

19
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:07,950
- Mm.
- We would love to do

20
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:10,824
a human-interest story about you
for the paper.

21
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:11,872
What do you say?

22
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:13,580
O-OK, let me think...

23
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,702
Well, first off, I'm so flattered
that you'd want to do a whole news story

24
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:19,879
just about me, that's so nice!

25
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:22,040
Heartfelt thanks to the whole Scoop family.

26
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:26,177
Can I ask, is your newspaper printed
on recycled paper?

27
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:28,380
Yes. Yeah, no, very recycled. The most.

28
00:02:28,932 --> 00:02:30,389
Alright then, come on in!

29
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,180
Great! Great. Uh, hey, you know,
before we forget

30
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,804
can Janet take a photo of you for the paper?

31
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,264
Oh...

32
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:39,891
OK, can you look up a little,
and to the right?

33
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:43,486
Smile, but only with your mouth
and not your eyes?

34
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:44,941
Perfect.

35
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:53,029
It was 1972.

36
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:56,286
Uh, my friend Randy and I ate
some magic mushrooms.

37
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:59,585
Randy asked me,
"What do you think happens when you die?"

38
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:04,250
And I saw, with perfect clarity,
how the afterlife works.

39
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,253
Immediately, I knew I had to live
a perfect life.

40
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,429
Well, not immediately.

41
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:13,007
The next day,
all I could do was watch kung fu movies

42
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,598
and stroke a blanket
that I thought was my cat.

43
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,559
But soon after, I designed a life

44
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:22,897
that would maximize my point total
and help me get into the Good Place

45
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,852
- and I've been living it ever since.
- Mm.

46
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:28,649
- I know this sounds crazy.
- No! No, actually, it makes...

47
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:30,608
- it makes perfect sense.
- Oh!

48
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:34,574
Oh, boy, you've been sitting here
for ten minutes

49
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,665
and I haven't offered you anything
to eat or drink.

50
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,540
- Oh...
- Would you like some water?

51
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:39,951
Or fresh radishes?

52
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:41,376
Water'd be great.

53
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,211
Janet! How cool is he?

54
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,008
You know, for a celebrity

55
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:52,886
he's amazingly down-to-earth.
Stars, they really are just like us.

56
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:57,260
He's so thoughtful with his actions.
Thank goodness he had that hallucination.

57
00:03:57,646 --> 00:04:00,639
He could've had the one Randy had,
where everything was made of ears.

58
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:03,604
- Way less helpful.
- We have to learn everything we can

59
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:06,853
about what makes him tick
so we can use it to help others.

60
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:09,651
He is the blueprint, Janet.

61
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,446
He figured it all out.

62
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:14,614
Here we go - two waters.

63
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,510
Let me know if you're not happy with them.

64
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,333
I have ice cubes if it's too warm,
and a Koozie if it's too cold.

65
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:26,005
Oh...
Boy, that has an interesting aftertaste.

66
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,256
Is that from a nearby river?

67
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:30,756
Oh, no. Why take fresh water away
from the beavers and the fish?

68
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:33,554
- Ah...
- No, I have my composting toilet

69
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:35,510
hooked up to a water filtration system.

70
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:38,638
One man's waste is another man's water.

71
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:40,311
- Mm.
- And both men are me!

72
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:42,898
Hm, hm.

73
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,317
I'm pretty excited to relax
and have a drink.

74
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,524
I mean, saving souls feels great,
but Sydney to Budapest

75
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:51,735
to Phoenix to Calgary...

76
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,158
I'm so jet-lagged,
I can't even "regrender" my "chorf."

77
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,912
Don't even know what I was trying to say.

78
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,914
You need to get your blood flowing.
There's a pool table over there.

79
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,118
- Wanna play?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

80
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,170
Let's do it.

81
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,458
Tahani, can I ask your advice
about something?

82
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:12,152
Is it about your grating speaking voice?

83
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:15,096
I'm so glad you finally brought it up,
because honestly

84
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,016
- with a few elocution lessons...
- No, I want to ask you about Chidi.

85
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,308
What's wrong with my voice?

86
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,432
Nothing! It's lovely!

87
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:23,895
Tell me about Chidi!

88
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:27,976
So, it must get lonely up here
all by yourself without anyone to talk to?

89
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:31,775
Oh, I've got lots of friends.
There's this little guy, for example.

90
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,156
Yeah, it's a snail.

91
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:36,363
Hi, snail! I don't name them

92
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,448
in case they already have
a name they prefer.

93
00:05:38,622 --> 00:05:41,911
- Huh.
- So, this is an organic garden?

94
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,412
Yeah. Everything I eat, I grow myself.

95
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:47,253
The radish patch was actually here
when I moved in.

96
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:48,875
I thought it'd be mean to dig it up.

97
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:51,169
- Mean... to the radishes?
- Mm.

98
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,719
I also grow lentils,
because they require very little water

99
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,008
- and have the smallest carbon footprint.
- Huh.

100
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,012
All he consumes are lentils and radishes.

101
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,184
No, Janet. He also consumes...

102
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:03,557
his own waste.

103
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,312
So. Everything's fine.

104
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:09,145
How do you play pool again?
What are the rules?

105
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:12,104
That's one of the best things about pool,
dawg! There are no rules.

106
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,813
I am 100% sure there are.

107
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,612
Me and my friends play a special
Jacksonville style of pool.

108
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,864
It's called
"Special Jacksonville-style pool."

109
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:22,246
You hit whatever ball you want,
but you use your hands.

110
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,081
And that's it.

111
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:29,329
OK, your turn. I got a thousand points.

112
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:31,831
Oh - that's the other rule.
You make up your own points.

113
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:34,966
I got five million points.

114
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:37,761
Damn! How'd you get so good at this so fast?

115
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:44,177
So, in this whole other timeline,
Chidi and I said "I love you" to each other.

116
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:47,556
But he doesn't remember
any of that happened.

117
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:50,270
So, I guess my question is

118
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,312
when is the right time to tell someone
you were passionate lovers

119
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:56,193
in an alternate timeline in the afterlife,
but he doesn't remember

120
00:06:56,283 --> 00:07:00,027
because technically none of that "happened"
in this strand of the multi-verse?

121
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:01,657
You know what?

122
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,016
I'll just check with Yahoo answers,
I'm sure someone's weighed in.

123
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,908
No, no.
I'm flattered you would seek my advice

124
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:09,752
though I suppose it makes sense.

125
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:12,125
I'm sure the one constant
in all the reboots

126
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,835
was that you and I were best friends.

127
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:15,625
Uh-huh. Yep. Mm-hm.

128
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:19,420
Look, I don't think you would want
Chidi to know

129
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:21,005
what happened in the past

130
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,800
unless you wanted it to happen again
in the present.

131
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,262
You can't know how Chidi will react.

132
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,271
It may be painful, but it's never a bad idea
to tell someone how you feel.

133
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:34,314
Thanks, Tahani.

134
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:35,815
You give really good advice.

135
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,355
And you made a really hot centaur.

136
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,950
Sorry?

137
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:44,279
So, these are some of my 71
adopted dogs and wolves.

138
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:48,123
You've rescued every stray animal
that's ever wandered onto your property?

139
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:51,036
Oh, yes, ma'am!
I've been mauled several times.

140
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,370
Uh, this little guy here...

141
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:55,878
might look innocent, but, boy,
he goes right for the squeaker

142
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,612
if you know what I mean.

143
00:07:57,636 --> 00:08:00,344
Oh, this is fun. You get to meet Raymond.
Hi, Raymond!

144
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,342
Hi, dumdum.
Who are these two hosers?

145
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,470
Don't worry about Raymond,
he's just a local sociopath

146
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,768
who comes by my house
to take advantage of me.

147
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,763
I've got your laundry all folded
and ready for you.

148
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,813
For whatever reason, this loser
does whatever you tell him to do - watch.

149
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:16,063
Hey, give that guy your shoe!

150
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:18,274
Would that make you happy?

151
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:19,609
- Very happy.
- Oh...

152
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,861
- Now, give him your shoe.
- Oh, that's OK, Doug.

153
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,513
Don't... I don't need your shoe.
Please don't give me your shoe.

154
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,787
OK, well, then give me your shoe
or I'll be sad.

155
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:28,999
There you are.

156
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,036
Well, as long as he's happy.

157
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:36,831
See, if I make him happy, I get the points.
That's how the system works, remember?

158
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,461
Go get your shoe, idiot!

159
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:40,050
Be right back.

160
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:41,136
Ow.

161
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:42,382
Oh, that's a bleeder.

162
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:44,008
- Oh.
- Yeah.

163
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:49,727
Michael, face facts. Doug is not
the "blueprint" of how to live a good life.

164
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:51,349
He's become a happiness pump.

165
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:52,439
What?

166
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,681
Remember, from Chidi's lessons?

167
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,440
I remember the term "happiness pump".

168
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,612
That's just mostly because Eleanor and Jason
made a bunch of dirty jokes about it.

169
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,947
It's a criticism of utilitarianism.

170
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,326
A happiness pump is someone
who is obsessed with maximising

171
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,369
the overall good, at his or her expense.

172
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:11,248
Doug will do literally anything
to make other people happy

173
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:12,791
even if it makes him miserable.

174
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,873
Oh, I don't think he's miserable.

175
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:18,414
So, everyone happy and contented in here?

176
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:19,923
- What's...
- Oh.

177
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:22,794
I volunteer to test cosmetics
for a local company

178
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:24,469
so they don't have to test on animals.

179
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,639
- It's fun!
- Ah.

180
00:09:25,682 --> 00:09:27,389
For the animals who don't have to do it.

181
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:29,971
For me, it's like wearing a mask of fire!

182
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,681
Uh, what can I do for you now?

183
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,269
Would you like to move in permanently
or would either of you like any more water

184
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,940
- or one of my kidneys?
- You know what?

185
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:38,684
We have absolutely everything we need.

186
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,565
Thank you. Uh, we're gonna head out now.

187
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:43,944
OK, well, it was so nice to meet you, Janet,
and you, Mark.

188
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:46,075
- I mean, Michael.
- Huh.

189
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:48,653
I called you Mark.

190
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,742
- Your name is Michael.
- No, no, that's OK.

191
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:52,414
Hey, hey, stay with me here, buddy.

192
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,332
No, no, no, no, this is very bad.

193
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:57,294
Forgetting someone's name,
that's definitely lost me some points.

194
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,293
Hey, you know, I've always secretly wished
my name was Mark.

195
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:01,919
Lie!

196
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,126
- That's a lie.
- Oh...

197
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,802
Now I'm accusing you of lying!
And now I'm yelling.

198
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:06,970
Why am I yelling?

199
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,554
I need to make this up.
I'm gonna give you a really nice haircut!

200
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:14,971
- Was that...?
- The snail? Yeah.

201
00:10:15,106 --> 00:10:16,625
Yeah, that was a snai... ooh.

202
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,766
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

203
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:20,310
I think he's still alive.

204
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:23,608
Do either of you know anything
about snail first-aid?

205
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,189
- No.
- Yes. I mean "no."

206
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,567
Alright, Michael,
I need you to find some scotch tape

207
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:29,110
while I apply pressure.

208
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:32,454
Too much pressure!
I'm gonna need that tape!

209
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,661
Oh! What?

210
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:39,712
Jacksonville style, baby!
30 million... points?

211
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:40,881
Nice one, homie!

212
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:42,589
Hey, what are you guys doing?

213
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:46,085
Well, I either know exactly what I'm doing,
and it's something

214
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:48,094
or we're doing nothing, and I'm winning!

215
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,844
Congrats. Um, can I talk to you
for a second?

216
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:53,551
OK, uh, a few days ago

217
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:56,057
Michael showed me something.

218
00:10:56,815 --> 00:11:00,274
And I don't know exactly
how to say this, but...

219
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,692
you and I are...

220
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,406
Bambadjan?

221
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:11,889
You know, I never thought about it before,
but yeah, we are kinda Bambadjan.

222
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:13,575
No, you jet-lagged doof.

223
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:17,371
Bambadjan is the name of a demon
from the Bad Place

224
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,873
who is somehow right over there.

225
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:25,425
Come with me.

226
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,759
Right now.

227
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:30,366
Hey, guys, having fun? Cool, cool, cool,
so we need to get out of here immediately

228
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,801
because this bar is full of demons.

229
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:34,120
Eleanor, just because these people
are wearing cheap leather

230
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:36,122
and stonewashed denim,
they're still part of the Queen's realm.

231
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,682
Calling them "demons" is a bit much.

232
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:40,685
No, no, no, no, no, actual demons,
like, from the Bad Place.

233
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,857
OK, Chidi and I
are gonna go out the side door.

234
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:44,184
You and Tahani go out the back.

235
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,507
Or we do this the old-fashioned way.

236
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,648
- How did you make that so fast?
- Bortle...

237
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:52,860
Mm... Mm...

238
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,490
Hello, idiots. Surprised to see me?

239
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,164
Right, you don't remember.

240
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:04,080
I'm Shawn. You are very scared of me.

241
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,624
Now, where's Michael?

242
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,196
We are here to celebrate the life

243
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,054
of Martin Luther Gandhi Tyler Moore,
the snail.

244
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:17,260
I named him-her that posthumously,
because I imagine him-her

245
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:21,643
to be the greatest and most talented snail
ever to have lived.

246
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:26,351
Michael, would you care to say a few words?

247
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,948
Oh, you're serious. Yes, um, OK.

248
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,072
Martin was a lot of things...

249
00:12:34,913 --> 00:12:36,404
a snail, mostly

250
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:37,989
but also a friend.

251
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,835
Martin taught us about life, about love

252
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,499
and about... the limits of scotch tape.

253
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,836
Goodbye, Martin.
Happy, slimy trails, old friend.

254
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,260
I'm sorry, I've got to leave right away.

255
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:59,806
I've decided to make a donation
to the Canadian Mollusc Association

256
00:13:00,063 --> 00:13:01,304
in Martin's honour.

257
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:04,189
Their office is in Edmonton,
so it will take me...

258
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,979
about three weeks
to walk there and back.

259
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:08,606
So, take care.

260
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,187
OK, look out, little fellas.

261
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:11,696
Heads up.

262
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,237
- Here comes a shoe.
- Say, Doug... look.

263
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:16,861
Do you mind if we ask you
just a few more questions?

264
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,326
What you're doing here,
how you're living your life

265
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,245
- it's just so wonderful.
- Mm.

266
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:24,409
But can I maybe give you
just a little advice?

267
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,541
I know I should donate more blood.

268
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:30,507
I'll try, but the last time I went down there
they said I was so anaemic

269
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,092
they ended up giving me blood.

270
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:33,669
No, look, look. Um...

271
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:39,388
I've been a reporter for a long time, Doug.
Met all sorts of people.

272
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:46,232
Travelled all over this crazy blue marble,
meetin' regular folks.

273
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,647
Every face tells a story, Doug.

274
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,399
Why, I'd say that those so-called
"regular" folks often turn out to be

275
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:56,108
not so regular after all.

276
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:57,447
- Michael.
- Sorry.

277
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:01,451
The point is,
I have never met anyone so dedicated

278
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,376
to making other people and...
and snails, happy.

279
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,498
- Huh!
- If what you're saying is true

280
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:11,923
about the afterlife, then you must've earned
more than enough points by now.

281
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:14,426
So, loosen up, bud, you know?

282
00:14:14,512 --> 00:14:17,846
Have a little fun.
Eat something besides lentils!

283
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,432
- Like radishes?
- No, no, Doug, damn it.

284
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:23,681
You know, just have ice cream,
or chicken parm...

285
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:25,266
Live your life, you know.

286
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:29,145
Travel. Drink regular water
that wasn't inside you.

287
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,602
OK, just relax.

288
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,651
- Thank you, Michael.
- Mm.

289
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,779
But, no, I can't do any of those things.

290
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:40,611
- Why not?
- Because I can't risk it.

291
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:47,122
There's an Accountant, out there somewhere,
measuring the value of everything I do.

292
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:52,377
What if I "relax," and do something
that loses me just enough points

293
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:56,256
to keep me out of the Good Place,
and I'm tortured for eternity?

294
00:14:57,221 --> 00:14:59,588
No, I... I have to make every moment count.

295
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,011
It's the only rational way to live.

296
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,553
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to walk to Edmonton

297
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,434
to give $85 to a snail charity.

298
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,356
Why don't you just take us
to the Bad Place already, dude?

299
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:16,342
Because I wanna see the look
on Michael's face when he realises he failed.

300
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,278
I love seeing the look on people's faces.

301
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:19,734
It's the best part of my job.

302
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,161
Dude, Michael's not coming here.

303
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:24,495
Face it, man, you are outmatched

304
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:26,991
because Michael and Janet are brilliant

305
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:30,627
and savvy, and they've been ten steps
ahead of you this whole time.

306
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,621
We can sit here as long as you want

307
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:36,212
but you will never, ever, ever...

308
00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:38,882
see Michael or Janet agai...

309
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,422
Yikes, that was rough! Total bust.

310
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:44,554
Ugh! Doug is a complete disaster.

311
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,392
And I drank his piss.

312
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:48,808
Hello, Michael.

313
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,854
See? See the look on his face?

314
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,277
So great.

315
00:15:57,365 --> 00:16:01,075
Hello, Shawn. Other demons.
What are you all doing down here?

316
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:03,042
What do you think we're doing,
you haemorrhoid?

317
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,953
We're ending this charade, once and for all.

318
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,823
These four humans are the legal property
of the Bad Place.

319
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,199
That's where we're taking them.

320
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:11,795
And you.

321
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,458
If you want them,
you're gonna have to go through me.

322
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:15,790
That's the idea.

323
00:16:15,925 --> 00:16:17,712
Well, it's a bad idea.

324
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,089
Oh, Michael. When will you ever learn...

325
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,424
Screw this! Let's fight!

326
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,392
Get somewhere safe, you guys!

327
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,686
Bad news!

328
00:16:30,148 --> 00:16:32,105
I've been going to the gym a lot!

329
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:33,733
- Oh, no!
- Chidi!

330
00:16:34,235 --> 00:16:36,568
What is happening?

331
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,187
I don't know!

332
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:40,230
No! Let him go!

333
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,317
Oh!

334
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:46,955
Let him go!

335
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,114
Twelve years of fencing. En garde!

336
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:54,494
Obviously,
I'd never do that in a competition.

337
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,956
That'd be a three-tenths deduction!

338
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:00,253
No, no! Watch out!
Watch out!

339
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:10,264
I've never marbleised
a Janet before!

340
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,807
Jacksonville Style, baby!
2,000 points!

341
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:16,151
Thanks, Jason.

342
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,778
Janet! Door!

343
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:30,284
Ha!

344
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,957
Yes!

345
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:46,300
Ha-ha!

346
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,803
Three hundred points! Best score ever!

347
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,848
Is it just me or is Janet
a straight-up hottie right now?

348
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,184
How are you this close to being
dragged to hell

349
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,768
- and still horny?
- I don't know.

350
00:17:59,862 --> 00:18:02,022
And how did you know they were demons?

351
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,364
Ugh, I can't tell you that now!

352
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,693
Screw it, what am I waiting for?
We could die in the next 30 seconds.

353
00:18:08,246 --> 00:18:11,535
So, Michael showed me a memory
of our time in the Good Place

354
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,500
and you and I were, like... a thing...

355
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,869
- and...
- Ha! Gotcha!

356
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:19,246
Not like a casual

357
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,360
"Hey, I found two loose pills
in the bottom of my tote

358
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:23,153
let's pop 'em and see what's good"
kinda thing.

359
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:24,759
We were in love.

360
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:28,840
And there's a real possibility that
I'm in love with you, again

361
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,892
here, on this plane of existence

362
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,682
uh, today, now... in Canada...

363
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:37,640
during this brawl... with demons.

364
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:41,484
Whoa!

365
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:43,302
Let's get her to the door!

366
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,115
No, no!

367
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,201
Oh, cool...

368
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:53,614
when I'm even partway through the door
to the afterlife, my powers come back!

369
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,666
They do?

370
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:00,040
They do. Thanks for asking!

371
00:19:05,052 --> 00:19:06,463
You're coming with me!

372
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:09,264
Hi there.

373
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:24,853
We did it!

374
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:27,489
- Oh... um...
- Well, no, no, no, of course.

375
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:30,109
Of course, Janet did it, yes.
But I had the, uh...

376
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,907
Thank you, Janet.

377
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,703
How did you get down here?

378
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:40,126
We have the only key to the door to Earth.

379
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:42,754
- We built our own door.
- That's impossible.

380
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,708
"That's impossible, eh!"
Ugh, you're such a dweeb.

381
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,334
Why can't you leave us alone?

382
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:50,045
You don't have enough nostrils
to stuff with wasps?

383
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:53,883
I don't want just any wasp-nostrils.
I want these wasp-nostrils.

384
00:19:54,477 --> 00:19:56,277
You're just delaying
the inevitable, Michael.

385
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:58,641
The Bad Place is going to get all
of them eventually.

386
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,976
These four, their loved ones

387
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,646
even your precious
pee-pee king Doug Forcett.

388
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,568
Now, why would you think that?

389
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,896
Just a hunch.

390
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:09,773
And do you want to know
what else I had a hunch about?

391
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:11,199
No.

392
00:20:13,454 --> 00:20:16,322
I mean, why let the guy
keep saying mean stuff, right?

393
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,829
I thought Doug Forcett was the "blueprint"
for leading a good life?

394
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,083
He seems pretty confident that Doug
is heading to the Bad Place.

395
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:28,838
For a while now, I have felt like
there was something wrong

396
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:31,762
with how the points system
was evaluating humans.

397
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:34,848
At first, I thought it was that
the system didn't allow

398
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,096
for the possibility that people
could improve.

399
00:20:37,186 --> 00:20:40,600
That's why I convinced the Judge
to send you back to Earth

400
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,682
so you could confront the ways
you were living.

401
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:48,521
But now, I'm worried that the problems
with the system might be much more serious.

402
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:52,024
We need to gather some real evidence.

403
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:55,410
Uh, sorry, no, no, uh...
Michael, you're confused.

404
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:58,118
Evidence isn't a good thing that you want.

405
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:03,578
It's a bad thing that you have to destroy,
or you go to jail.

406
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:07,331
Jason, quick. I-I need that coaster
over there behind the pillar.

407
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:08,672
You got it, boss!

408
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,002
I... I just needed a... a 30-second break.

409
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,138
Yeah.

410
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,033
What sort of evidence is this
and how do we get it?

411
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:17,390
Janet and I have to go right to the source

412
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,718
of the points themselves,
the Accountant's office.

413
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:23,347
Four of you, stay here at Doug Forcett's
house until I get back.

414
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,433
You're gonna need to feed all the dogs
and the wolves

415
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:29,360
and if a teenager shows up on a dirt-bike

416
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:31,530
just do as he says, he's very scary.

417
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:32,906
Michael, Michael, Michael!

418
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,571
I forgot what you asked me to get.

419
00:21:35,786 --> 00:21:37,402
That's OK, bud. Thanks anyway.

420
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,119
Look, we won't be long

421
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,351
and you guys should be safe here.

422
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,375
Actually, scratch that.

423
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,355
We're all screwed because
a bunch more demons just showed up.

424
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,940
- Oh!
- There's too many of 'em.

425
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:48,671
- What do we do?
- I have an idea.

426
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,212
I think I can take you into my void.

427
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:52,863
Cool, that sounds fun,
let's go into a void!

428
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:54,469
OK, let's go.

429
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,677
But just to be clear,
I don't know if you'll survive in my void

430
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,680
but either way, all of you will
definitely die on Earth when I do this

431
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,997
so look around and say goodbye!

432
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,229
Goodbye, Earth!
Wait, did you just say we're gonna di...
