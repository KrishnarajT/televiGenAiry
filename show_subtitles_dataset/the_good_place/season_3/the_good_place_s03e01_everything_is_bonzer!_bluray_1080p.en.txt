1
00:00:00,646 --> 00:00:03,280
and it's clearly the best way
to see if bad people

2
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:05,316
can become good
without knowing anything

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,318
about what's waiting for them
in the afterlife.

4
00:00:09,554 --> 00:00:11,188
- Okay, let's do it.
- Yes!

5
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:12,804
But there have to be strict rules.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,030
Otherwise, the results will be tainted,

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,023
and I reserve the right to
change my mind at any point.

8
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:20,932
Would someone who's not
an eternal being

9
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:23,134
please explain to me what the f...

10
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:56,133
Hi, I'm Michael.

11
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:58,512
You must be The Doorman.

12
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:03,140
Ah. This is wild.

13
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:05,676
I had no idea this was even here.

14
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,993
So I have this ruling from The Judge.

15
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:11,048
Heading on down to Earth
to reverse the deaths

16
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,904
of these four people.

17
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,654
It's kind of tricky, you know?
It starts up a new timeline,

18
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:17,853
so there might be some ripple effects.

19
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,243
But it's necessary for the experiment

20
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:22,274
that we're doing there.

21
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:25,930
So, how long's this trip take?
Hope I don't get a middle seat.

22
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:32,204
Wow, I haven't heard a joke
in 8,000 years.

23
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,399
And I still haven't.

24
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:36,674
That's the door to Earth.

25
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:39,043
You go through there, you'll be
wherever you need to be.

26
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:40,530
You won't have
any other powers, though.

27
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:41,934
You want to get around,
you're just going to have to

28
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:45,193
- take a bus or something.
- A bus?

29
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,118
Oh, boy, oh, man!

30
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:49,047
I'm going to sit
in a front-facing seat.

31
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:51,762
Or... or no, maybe
a sideways-facing seat.

32
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:54,166
I'm... I'm going to get so motion sick!

33
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,626
Oh, man!

34
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:57,061
What do I do,
just grab that key here...

35
00:01:57,096 --> 00:01:58,562
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36
00:01:58,597 --> 00:02:01,399
This key is made
of the very first atoms

37
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:04,202
that came into existence
in the universe.

38
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:07,371
It is one of a kind
and cannot be duplicated.

39
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:09,067
See?

40
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,994
"Do Not Duplicate."

41
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:13,597
Only I touch this key.

42
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:16,107
Oh, and what's the
significance of the keychain?

43
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:19,535
Nothing, I just like frogs.
I'm a frog guy.

44
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:23,149
When you need to get back here,
make sure you're alone.

45
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:26,056
Press this button. Any questions?

46
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:28,293
No? Great.

47
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,262
Knock yourself out.

48
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:36,768
Uh-oh.

49
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,579
I-I'm sorry, but this is
an important moment...

50
00:02:48,614 --> 00:02:52,116
- On your right, mate!
- Oh, jeez, watch it, man!

51
00:02:55,192 --> 00:02:58,095
Come down! Come down where you belong.

52
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:03,762
Buongiorno. Buongiorno.

53
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:13,161
Oh, wow! I was just on Earth.

54
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:14,870
It was incredible.

55
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:17,982
The... the traffic, the pigeons.

56
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,316
And I saw this place that was, at once,

57
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:23,454
a Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell!

58
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:27,999
I mean, oh! The mind reels.

59
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:32,656
A Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell! Ah!

60
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,904
Oh, Janet, it was everything
I ever imagined.

61
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,407
I got to ride a bike.

62
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:46,423
I put a coin in a thing
and got a gumball.

63
00:03:46,505 --> 00:03:48,458
And then someone
came up to me and said,

64
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,518
"Hot enough for ya?"
And you know what I said?

65
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:52,417
I said, "Tell me about it."

66
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,829
Well, I am glad that you
got to chew a gumball.

67
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:56,673
Oh, damn.

68
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,038
I didn't even think to chew it.

69
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,258
Missed opportunity, shoot.

70
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,115
Did you also save their lives?

71
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,697
Yes, of course. Everyone is safe.

72
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:08,009
Including Jason.

73
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:10,146
Now we just sit back

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,538
and watch as they become better people.

75
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:16,202
Being good is for suckers.
What do you even get out of it?

76
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,447
I quit. Eat my farts,
Benedict Cumberbatch.

77
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,495
Morning, Chidi.
Blueberry muffin for ya?

78
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:25,911
Uh, I don't know, maybe.
I can't decide.

79
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,247
- You all right there, mate?
- Okay, I've made my decision.

80
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,348
I want to...

81
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,286
start crying.

82
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,839
Hey, Tahani Al-Jamil.

83
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:44,224
I'm from "International
Sophisticate Magazine."

84
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,384
Mind if we ask you 582 questions?

85
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:49,267
- Sounds delightful.
- Where are we, exactly?

86
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:52,536
My pied-a-terre, just off
the coast of "Barthelona."

87
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:54,706
What's one thing people
don't know about you?

88
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,608
That I was such a tomboy
in high school.

89
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,211
- See?
- Wow! Looking good.

90
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:01,812
Okay, next question.

91
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:04,582
Who would you say is the most
famous person in your phone?

92
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:06,418
It's not about who you know.

93
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,091
Enlightenment comes from within.

94
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:12,930
The Dalai Lama texted me that.

95
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,762
K, will you make me
the happiest man in the world,

96
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,832
and agree to be my wife?

97
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:22,933
No.

98
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,293
Do you think my name is the letter K?

99
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:26,637
Just say yes.

100
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:28,630
If we're married, legally
you can't arrest me.

101
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,182
Plus, bonus... you get
half the stuff I stole.

102
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:33,844
Yep, he just confessed to the robbery.

103
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,620
Damn it.

104
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:40,255
You realize what the problem is, right?

105
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,420
Yes, but there's no way to help.

106
00:05:46,524 --> 00:05:47,791
Maybe there is.

107
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,594
In the afterlife, they all got better

108
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:51,868
because they helped each other.

109
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,002
And the key to that was
Chidi and Eleanor's connection.

110
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,500
If I get the two of them together,

111
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,202
- everything else will follow.
- Michael, no.

112
00:05:58,236 --> 00:05:59,937
I'm going to meet Eleanor someplace

113
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:03,841
and plant the idea in her mind
that she needs to find Chidi.

114
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,610
Oh, and then maybe I'll visit Chidi

115
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:08,036
and make sure that he helps her
when she shows up.

116
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,709
I'm just going to nudge
the two of them together.

117
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,094
Just nudge-y nudge nudge.

118
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,315
The Judge was pretty clear
in her instructions,

119
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:16,368
and The Judge is, you know, The Judge

120
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,791
of, you know, the universe.

121
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:21,190
She'll never find out.

122
00:06:21,245 --> 00:06:22,945
She spends all her time in her chambers

123
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,495
bingeing TV shows.

124
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,219
She's watching all of "NCIS" right now.

125
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:31,368
Hey, there.

126
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:35,079
Need to head on back to Earth.
Travel papers.

127
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:38,570
Yeah. You know, The Judge
said to use the same ones.

128
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,512
Because I'm, uh, you know,
visiting the same people.

129
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,098
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

130
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:46,017
I brought you a nice
hot cup of antimatter.

131
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:48,606
I usually only drink decaf antimatter.

132
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,488
- Ah.
- Eh, I'll take it.

133
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:51,723
It's only 4:30.

134
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:53,423
My shift doesn't end until 9 billion.

135
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,259
Ooh.

136
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:59,497
- What do I owe ya?
- The real question, Eleanor,

137
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,880
is what do we owe to each other?

138
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,735
What do we owe to each other?

139
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:07,939
That is the question Tim
Scanlon asked decades ago,

140
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,841
and it is the question
I will try to answer

141
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,010
over the next three hours.

142
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,923
Are you Chidi Anna... Kendrick?

143
00:07:15,947 --> 00:07:17,916
Anagonye, and yes.

144
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:21,685
Great, hi.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

145
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:24,454
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

146
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:26,891
Okay, uh, where do I start?

147
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:30,795
I'm not, like,
the best person in the world.

148
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:34,492
I'm a trash bag from Arizona,
which is saying something.

149
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:37,247
Our biggest exports
are racist sheriffs and HPV.

150
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,305
But about a year ago,
something crazy happened...

151
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:41,815
And I...

152
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,447
Sorry. I've been flying
for like, 40 hours.

153
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:52,483
This is Australia, right?

154
00:07:52,517 --> 00:07:55,820
Yes. I grew up in Senegal, so
my native language is French.

155
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:58,723
But I went to American schools,
so I also speak English.

156
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:00,676
- Oh.
- And German and Greek.

157
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:03,560
And Latin, just in case
it ever comes back.

158
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:07,497
Cool. I once got 12 out of 12
on a Buzzfeed quiz called

159
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:08,632
"Do you know all the slang words

160
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,101
the Kardashians invented?"

161
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:12,070
- Congratulations?
- Thank you.

162
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,904
I'm going to be honest. I did cheat.

163
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,839
But you were saying something
crazy happened to you?

164
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,010
Yes, uh, I almost died.

165
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:21,512
And it made me want to
become a better person,

166
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:23,080
which I did for a while.

167
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:26,117
But then I fell back into
my old trash bag ways.

168
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:29,945
Yesterday, I saw your lecture,
and something just clicked.

169
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:33,146
Wait, you flew all the way
here from Arizona

170
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,366
just to see me?

171
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,366
You know what,
don't flatter yourself, pal.

172
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,382
Sorry, that's a knee-jerk reaction.

173
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:40,474
Yes, that's exactly what I did.

174
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:43,331
And I know that seems zonk-atronic...

175
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,868
that's Khloe's word for crazy...

176
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,940
but I need someone to help
guide me, morally speaking.

177
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:53,611
And I think I need it to be you.

178
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,945
What do you say?

179
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:58,116
Will you help me become a good person?

180
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,594
Yes.

181
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:13,690
I'll start you off with some
introductory philosophy books,

182
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,770
and then we'll meet here once a week.

183
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:17,776
Great. Ideally, some of those books

184
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,570
will have been made into a
movie or maybe a funny GIF.

185
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,339
But anything's good with me, man.

186
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:25,946
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,377
Why are you helping me?

188
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:30,680
I'm a teacher. That's my job.

189
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:32,016
Yeah, but I'm not your student.

190
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:35,523
I'm just some hot rando
who walked in off the street.

191
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,593
There's got to be another reason.

192
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:40,654
Yes, there is. Um...

193
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:43,405
I also had a near-death experience.

194
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:44,700
- Whoa.
- Well, I mean, I don't know

195
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:45,852
for sure that I would have died, but,

196
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,600
it was pretty nuts.

197
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm sorry,

198
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:50,161
but this is an important
moment in our friendship...

199
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:53,087
- On your right, mate!
- Oh, jeez. Watch it, man!

200
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:57,440
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

201
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,945
That... that is right
where I was standing.

202
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:03,224
I was frozen here, unable to
make a single decision,

203
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:05,815
and I almost got crushed
by an air conditioner.

204
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,655
This is a sign.

205
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:09,484
I shouldn't be using air conditioners.

206
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:11,791
The freon is awful for the environment.

207
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,930
That's the lesson you take from this?

208
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:19,695
Chidi, your brain is broken.
You need to fix your brain.

209
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,800
So in a nutshell,
I have a 3,600-page thesis

210
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:26,435
that I am nowhere near finishing,

211
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:29,004
I am absolutely paralyzed
by decision-making,

212
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,507
and it is destroying my life.

213
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,344
Yeah, I sort of got that

214
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:34,869
when you couldn't
choose a chair to sit on.

215
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:36,383
Well, I didn't want to offend you

216
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:38,271
in case you had a favorite.

217
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:41,833
Look, I know I just
kind of... nope... walked in here,

218
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:44,796
and you don't know me at all,
but is there any way to tell

219
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:48,530
if my indecision
is due to a brain thing?

220
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,224
Um, yeah, sure.

221
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:52,747
Now what we do is
we make a lengthy incision

222
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:54,964
from your eyebrows
to the nape of your neck,

223
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:57,366
and we peel your face back, right,

224
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:58,700
then slice your skull open.

225
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:01,103
And I just randomly stab at your brain

226
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:02,805
with an electrified needle.

227
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,642
The fun part is
you're awake the whole time.

228
00:11:06,962 --> 00:11:08,719
Uh...

229
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:11,521
I'm kidding! I'll just give you an MRI

230
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,657
and look at the part of your brain

231
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:14,050
that controls decision-making.

232
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:15,718
Oh, I want that.

233
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,344
I need to learn about my brain, please.

234
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:22,023
Well, so you just march
into my office unannounced,

235
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,826
tell me your brain is broken,
then demand I drop everything

236
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,253
and just put you in the university's

237
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,564
$3 million MRI machine?

238
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,233
Oh, I'm sorry, I just...

239
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:32,568
I freaking love it.

240
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,137
You're so weird! Let's go.

241
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:36,839
- Right now?
- Oh, yeah, come on.

242
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:37,906
Oh... okay.

243
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:42,744
This is your hippocampus.
It regulates memory.

244
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,714
Yours looks great, very strong.
Gorgeous hippocampus here!

245
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:50,051
This is your ventromedial
prefrontal cortex,

246
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:51,945
the center of decision-making.

247
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,834
This is where the magic happens.

248
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,690
Do you see how it's all lit up?

249
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,425
That's a flurry of activity
that occurred

250
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,310
when I asked you to choose
between red and blue,

251
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:00,595
and you almost passed out.

252
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:02,616
Is it too late to pick blue instead?

253
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:04,545
It is, yeah.

254
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:08,076
The point is, at first glance,
your brain is very healthy.

255
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:10,531
Huh, there are actual answers here,

256
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,035
data you can observe and learn from.

257
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:15,988
Yeah, man, science is
all about getting answers.

258
00:12:16,051 --> 00:12:18,052
You philosophers
can spend your entire life

259
00:12:18,147 --> 00:12:20,348
mulling over a single questions.

260
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:22,503
That's why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

261
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,052
No offense.

262
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:25,335
Oh, none taken. We suck.

263
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:27,381
Yeah.

264
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:36,665
- Chidi.
- One blueberry muffin, please.

265
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,703
Why choose to be good every day?

266
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,805
I argue that we choose to be good

267
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,739
because of our bonds with other people.

268
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:48,677
Simply put, we are not in this alone.

269
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:50,252
Thank you.

270
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,468
Wow, Chidi.

271
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,084
You chose that muffin
in less than a minute.

272
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:59,392
That beats your old record
by 59 minutes.

273
00:12:59,464 --> 00:13:01,781
Henry, I feel amazing.

274
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:03,825
I am 100 pages into my new thesis,

275
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:06,161
and it is some of the best
writing that I have ever done.

276
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,527
I haven't been this happy since...

277
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:12,133
Oh, wow. I've never been happy.

278
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:14,611
- Ha!
- Bad!

279
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:16,055
I'm proud of you, mate.

280
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,714
It must be really nice
to live that way.

281
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:18,800
Well, that's the beauty of it.

282
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:20,175
Anyone can live this way.

283
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,844
Just decide to be more decisive.

284
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,670
Like, what's something that
you've always wanted to do?

285
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:27,385
I mean, I have been
putting off getting in shape.

286
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,212
Then make the decision
to wake up tomorrow morning

287
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:32,770
and get in shape. It is that easy.

288
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,818
Okay. Maybe I will!

289
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:37,445
- What have you got to lose?
- Nothing!

290
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,569
Henry, what happened to you?

291
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:43,146
Well, I was using
the leg press at the gym,

292
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:46,343
and you know how your legs
bend a certain way?

293
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:49,215
My legs bend the other way now. Oh, no.

294
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,565
All the tendons in my legs
snapped like violin strings,

295
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,204
and then, my foot flew forwards,

296
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,479
and I kicked myself in the face,

297
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:56,878
which gave me a concussion.

298
00:13:56,912 --> 00:14:00,015
But on the bright side,
I lost control of my bladder.

299
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,951
Someone got it on video, and now

300
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:08,190
"Leg Press Whizzer"
has 62,000 views on Youtube.

301
00:14:08,662 --> 00:14:11,631
- I'm famous.
- This is all my fault.

302
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:14,162
I did this to you. Oh... oh, muffins!

303
00:14:14,257 --> 00:14:16,297
I brought blueberry muffins.

304
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,533
Oh, no, you shouldn't
eat blueberries anymore.

305
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,235
Read an article. The migrant workers

306
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,271
who pick them are horribly mistreated.

307
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:26,824
Yaaaaaaah!

308
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:30,979
Good morning, Chidi.
Blueberry muffin for ya?

309
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:33,610
Uh, I don't know, maybe.
I can't decide.

310
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:36,170
- You all right there, mate?
- Okay, I've made my decision.

311
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,507
I want to...

312
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:40,843
start crying.

313
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:46,262
Excuse me?

314
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,463
What is the maximum number
of books that I can check out?

315
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:50,955
- Is it 12,000?
- Got a wild weekend planned?

316
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,935
Well, I need to find
a new topic for my thesis,

317
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:55,525
and I had this thing happen
that made me more decisive,

318
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,517
and a few months ago, my friend
broke both of his legs,

319
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,608
and it's my fault, and
blueberries, and I need help.

320
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,176
- Whoo!
- Maybe that help will come

321
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,970
from Tay Zonday's autobiography,

322
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:06,521
"Chocolate Book." I mean, who's to say?

323
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:09,416
Mate, I've worked
in this library a long time,

324
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,595
and I've seen a lot of academic types

325
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,922
with that same helpless
look on their faces.

326
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,892
They all made it through okay.

327
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:20,810
- Once they learned the secret.
- What's the secret?

328
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:22,132
There's a secret?
Is the secret more books?

329
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,393
- How many more books do I need?
- It's not about books, mate.

330
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:26,635
It's about perspective.

331
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,818
Sometimes, when you're
feeling helpless,

332
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,545
the secret is to help someone else.

333
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,773
Get out of your own head. Trust me.

334
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,545
The next time someone
asks for help, say yes.

335
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,051
A few hours later, you walked
in and asked for help.

336
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,129
Now, I don't know
if this is going to solve

337
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:48,760
all of my problems,
but it's worth a try, right?

338
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:51,587
Well, thank you, sexy librarian guy.

339
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,749
I didn't say he was sexy.

340
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,238
Oh, I know, but whenever anyone

341
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:56,579
tells me a story about their life,

342
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:58,910
I always imagine all the people
as being super hot.

343
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:00,636
Otherwise, I quickly lose interest.

344
00:16:01,017 --> 00:16:04,575
Do you not do that?
You can do it for free.

345
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:06,975
I got to say, I enjoyed

346
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,179
playing the role of mysterious
librarian, and I really

347
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:12,555
nailed the Australian accent.

348
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:14,969
- Uh-huh, flawless.
- Thank you.

349
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:17,992
But the point is,
Eleanor and Chidi are together,

350
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:21,842
and now we can relax.
Everything is finally on track.

351
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,366
- Status report.
- They're plugging away,

352
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,368
but we still can't hack
into The Judge's system.

353
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:34,271
Damn it, those four humans

354
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:36,330
have been on Earth for over a year.

355
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:38,857
I need to know
if they're getting better.

356
00:16:38,974 --> 00:16:40,209
Can I just ask?

357
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:42,532
We torture, like, 30 billion humans.

358
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:44,693
Why do you care so much
about these four?

359
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:50,055
Never mind. Forget I asked.

360
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,664
Serves him right for
questioning you, boss.

361
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,189
I think you're doing a great job.

362
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:56,570
Thank you, Todd.

363
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,934
- No, no, no, no...
- Why did you do that?

364
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:01,552
I'm a demon. It's fun.

365
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,021
No one leaves this room

366
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,079
until we've accessed
The Judge's system.

367
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:08,107
Would music help?
Should I play some music?

368
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,405
Good idea.

369
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:11,005
Choose something deeply terrible

370
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,308
to inspire us.

371
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:20,870
Oh, yeah. That's the stuff.

372
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:25,746
So for Aristotle, virtue is practical.

373
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:28,310
Goodness isn't something that
a person just inherently has.

374
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:31,537
It's something that she
achieves through her actions.

375
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,241
- Questions?
- Uh, yeah, a few.

376
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,144
I wrote down "what?"huh?"

377
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,273
And then this doodle of a burrito

378
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,935
because when I first read Aristotle,

379
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,317
I thought it was pronounced
like Chipotle.

380
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,685
Wait a minute, is it "Chip-o-tottle"?

381
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:48,156
These are all great questions.

382
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,524
But I have to meet my thesis
adviser across campus.

383
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,260
Oh, well, I'm headed that way, too.

384
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:55,840
I'll walk with you. Hey, so,

385
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:57,714
I've been trying to figure out

386
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,462
how to pay you back for helping me.

387
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,446
I told you, you don't owe me anything.

388
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:03,508
At home, when I want to
get something nice

389
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:04,704
for one of my friends,

390
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:09,037
it usually comes in the form
of something edible.

391
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:11,302
You get what I'm saying?
An "edible" thing?

392
00:18:11,378 --> 00:18:13,780
- Please don't buy me drugs.
- Okay, copy that.

393
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,735
I had no choice, I was in his driveway

394
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,102
taking pictures when he walked out,

395
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:19,800
so I said "Hey, Mr. Crowe,
I'm from the gas company."

396
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:22,523
- "I loved you in 'Gladiator.'"
- Chidi, hey!

397
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:23,749
- Hey!
- I got a question.

398
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,358
Is it "What's my thesis topic?"

399
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:28,002
- Because I still don't know.
- No, it's not that.

400
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:31,263
Oh, I'm sorry.
You guys haven't met yet.

401
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:34,321
- Um, Simone, this is Eleanor.
- The famous Simone.

402
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,935
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

403
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,816
So I've got to do some MRI scans

404
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,438
as a control for an experiment.

405
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:41,379
And since you loved it
so much last time,

406
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:42,535
I was wondering if you could just

407
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:43,577
pop back in there and help me out?

408
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,244
- Oh, absolutely.
- Cool, okay.

409
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,913
Well, just come by my lab at 6:00

410
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:48,788
and then afterwards, I can
buy you dinner as a thank you.

411
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:51,005
Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.

412
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:52,792
Oh, okay.

413
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:54,873
Well, uh, I'll see you later.
Nice to meet you.

414
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:56,755
- You, too.
- Yeah.

415
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,102
- What?
- Uh, you and Simone

416
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:03,962
had some real professor
dork vibes flowing.

417
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,666
You're both teachers
who are hot for teacher.

418
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:08,268
How have you not

419
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:09,628
asked her out yet?

420
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:11,821
- Are you scared?
- Well, it's not impressive

421
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:13,406
to guess that I'm scared, Eleanor.

422
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:17,839
I'm scared of everything, and I
can't just do things like that.

423
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,157
- Just drop it, okay?
- Well...

424
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:21,963
Okay, just promise me you'll drop it.

425
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,022
Okay. I promise.

426
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:29,028
So you're into Chidi, right?
I mean, forgive my bluntness,

427
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:30,934
but I'm usually right
about these things.

428
00:19:31,348 --> 00:19:34,096
Well, yeah, but I made it
pretty clear a bunch of times,

429
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:35,271
and he's never responded,

430
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,241
so I just assumed he wasn't interested.

431
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,908
Okay, I'm all set.

432
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:41,463
I'm just going to ask you
some basic questions, Chidi.

433
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:44,021
- What is one plus one?
- Two.

434
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:46,282
- What color is the sky?
- Blue.

435
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,951
What color are Simone's eyes?

436
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:50,626
Brown. Uh... uh, what?

437
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:54,070
If you could take Simone
anywhere on a date,

438
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:55,626
where would you take her?

439
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:57,593
Sorry, is this part of the experiment?

440
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,629
It is now, yes.
Please answer the question.

441
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,265
And keep in mind,
we can see your brain.

442
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:04,667
Next question. You are into Simone.

443
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:07,704
- That's not a question.
- So you agree it's a fact.

444
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,174
Next question's for Simone.

445
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:10,639
Simone, are you annoyed at Chidi

446
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:12,475
for waiting so long to ask you out?

447
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,777
- Yes, I am.
- Chidi, same question for you.

448
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,379
Are you annoyed at yourself

449
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:18,314
for waiting so long to ask out Simone?

450
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:19,649
I mean, I'm annoyed with you,

451
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:21,318
and I've only known you three weeks.

452
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:24,252
Yes, I am obviously
very annoyed with myself.

453
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:25,328
Can I get out now?

454
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:27,193
No, you can't. It'll ruin the science.

455
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:31,126
There's only one question left,
and you got to ask it, bud.

456
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,633
Simone, would you
like to have dinner with me?

457
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,383
Wow, that is highly inappropriate.

458
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:40,847
- Uh...
- I'm just kidding.

459
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:43,089
Yes, I would. Thank you for asking.

460
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,510
- Aw, cute.
- This is a disaster.

461
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:47,845
Michael, relax.

462
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,679
How are the two of them going to bond?

463
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:51,664
There were plenty of reboots
where Eleanor and Chidi

464
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:54,456
weren't even soul mates,
and he still always helped her.

465
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:57,128
Simone and Chidi are good together.

466
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,355
I've been running simulations

467
00:20:58,388 --> 00:20:59,923
on what their kids will be like.

468
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:02,592
One of them is hot enough
to be on "The Bachelor"

469
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:05,529
and smart enough to never go
on "The Bachelor."

470
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:09,599
This is not just about Chidi.
I've left too much to chance.

471
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,534
Until our group is back together again,

472
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,436
this whole thing
is hanging by a thread.

473
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:16,739
I'm going back down.
You're pressing your luck.

474
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,041
If you keep disobeying Mommy,

475
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,775
something bad is going to happen.

476
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,646
- What?
- Oh, I don't have a mom,

477
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:22,879
so I've been experimenting

478
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,549
with thinking of The Judge as my mom.

479
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,475
- It's weird, forget it.
- Okay.

480
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:30,310
How are you even going to get
Jason and Tahani to Australia?

481
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,723
I have no idea, but I have to try.

482
00:21:32,756 --> 00:21:34,457
Well, good luck, Dad.

483
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:36,633
Nope, also weird. Just go.

484
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,061
Hey, bud.

485
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:42,541
Brought you some
decaf hazelnut antimatter.

486
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,868
Just a little treat
for my old pal, The Doorman.

487
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:47,782
Heading back down, by the way.

488
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,568
You sure The Judge is okay with you

489
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:51,742
going back to Earth so many times?

490
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:55,579
Oh, yeah, yeah, all good.
See, still got the papers.

491
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,393
Shouldn't be long.

492
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,599
How are we doing, Steve?

493
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,592
I'm trying. I'm getting close.

494
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,384
Good. No pressure.

495
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:16,293
Aha!

496
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,075
Someone just went down to Earth,

497
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:20,771
and that gave me a back door
into The Judge's system.

498
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:22,027
Now we can see everything
that's happening

499
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,807
with all four humans.

500
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:28,289
Excellent work, Steve.

501
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:32,950
Uh-oh, looks like someone's
been cocooning again.

502
00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:34,977
You know, it would be a real
help if you let me know

503
00:22:35,002 --> 00:22:36,137
the next time you were about to...

504
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,159
Well, well, well.

505
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:44,493
Looks like Michael's been caught

506
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,963
with his hand in the human jar.

507
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:48,150
- Good one, boss.
- Shut up, Glenn.

508
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:53,282
Morning, teach.
Ready to discuss philosophy.

509
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:55,760
Obviously, I'm
kidding. How was your date with Simone?

510
00:22:55,784 --> 00:22:58,220
Spill it, sweetheart.
We had a great time.

511
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:01,524
Thank you again for bullying me
into asking her out.

512
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,464
Well, I owed it to you.

513
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:07,655
And bonus, I realized
I was practicing virtue ethics

514
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:09,522
by helping the two of you bone down.

515
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:11,391
Okay, not appropriate.

516
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,027
Also, not a great understanding
of virtue ethics.

517
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,243
Oh, we can agree to disagree.

518
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,837
But if you must know,
it was very chaste.

519
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,352
We didn't even kiss.

520
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,435
- Because you chickened out?
- I did!

521
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:25,438
Yeah, I totally chickened out,
and I am so mad at myself.

522
00:23:25,473 --> 00:23:28,576
Well, hey, maybe
it wasn't the right moment.

523
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,041
Knowing the two of you nerds,
your first kiss

524
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,714
is going to be while reading
Plato in an MRI machine.

525
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:39,674
Oh, hang on. Come with me.

526
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:43,010
Simone, what's the one thing
Eleanor and I have in common?

527
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:44,961
You both have a complete
disregard for my office hours.

528
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:46,694
- Sorry, Reginald.
- Oh, no worries.

529
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,913
Look, listen, Eleanor
is an Arizona trash bag.

530
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,272
- Yep.
- Her words, not mine.

531
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,375
- Totally.
- Who once told me that

532
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:52,703
her greatest accomplishment

533
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:54,462
was breaking
into Charles Barkley's house.

534
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:56,312
Mm. He was on the road.

535
00:23:56,338 --> 00:23:58,271
I snuck in through the doggy door.

536
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:01,656
Tried on all his giant shoes.
One of my top five Christmases.

537
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:03,522
Listen, the point is,

538
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:06,474
Eleanor and I have nothing in common

539
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,390
except that we both almost died,

540
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,451
and it made us
want to be better people.

541
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,054
This is my thesis idea.

542
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:15,616
I will explore the effect
of near-death experiences

543
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,195
on ethical decision-making.

544
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:19,066
I will get a group of people together

545
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,593
who have had near-death experiences,

546
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:21,928
ask them ethical questions,

547
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:23,606
and see if there's any commonalities!

548
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,443
That's great!
Why are you yelling it at me?

549
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,088
Because I need your help!

550
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:31,004
You and your magic brain scan machine.

551
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,806
Oh, of course!

552
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:35,159
A joint study with
the neuroscience department.

553
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:37,759
We can use MRI mapping to see
if a near-death experience

554
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:38,913
alters brain function.

555
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,146
There's something there, right?

556
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:41,590
Definitely, I love this.

557
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:43,323
Great. Also, I wanted
to kiss you last night,

558
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,560
but I chickened out,
so I'm going to kiss you now.

559
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,385
Good, yes. I want that, please.

560
00:24:51,412 --> 00:24:54,299
Oh, sorry, Reginald.
What were you saying?

561
00:24:54,381 --> 00:24:56,373
Um, that I can't come to class tomorrow

562
00:24:56,404 --> 00:24:59,004
- 'cause my grandma died.
- Oof.

563
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:03,691
Real mood ruiner. Read the room, dude.

564
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:13,453
Bingo. Okay.

565
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,053
Oh, good, you're here.

566
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,826
Eleanor, meet the newest member

567
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,718
of our ethical neuro-scientific study,

568
00:25:18,752 --> 00:25:20,053
Tahani Al-Jamil.

569
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:22,723
Hello, Eleanor. Delighted to meet you.

570
00:25:22,964 --> 00:25:26,481
Al-Jamil. Oh, you're Kamilah's sister.

571
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,061
I am, yes.

572
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:30,137
If you want an autograph or something,

573
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,416
I can probably arrange it.

574
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:34,409
Eh, I was never really
that into her... no offense.

575
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:38,595
Oh, I assure you, there is none taken.

576
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,298
So how did you come to join our team?

577
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:44,788
Well, it's a bit of a story, I suppose.

578
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:46,923
It, uh, began about a year ago.

579
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,918
Come down! Come down where you belong.

580
00:25:51,953 --> 00:25:53,153
Aah!

581
00:25:57,885 --> 00:26:00,828
- Well done, Tahani.
- Who saved me?

582
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:02,744
Did anyone see who just saved my life?

583
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,432
- It was Kamilah!
- No, it was a man, I think.

584
00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:07,533
- It was Kamilah!
- It was Kamilah!

585
00:26:07,623 --> 00:26:11,616
No, it wasn't Kamilah!
It was someone over there.

586
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,184
Kamilah, Kamilah,
Kamilah, Kamilah, Kamilah!

587
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,367
I had almost died.

588
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,877
And in that very moment,
I decided to change my life.

589
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:27,186
First, I cleansed myself of
all the worldly possessions

590
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,622
that had been weighing
me down like anchors...

591
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:32,960
the dresses, the jewels.
I gave them all to Good Will.

592
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:35,095
That's what I call Prince William.

593
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:38,418
Since he'd married a commoner,
I assumed he'd know

594
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:40,678
some needy people they could go to.

595
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:42,416
Sure.

596
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:44,871
Then I deleted all my
celebrity contacts

597
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:46,205
from my mobile.

598
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:50,258
Good-bye, Bono. Good-bye, The Edge.

599
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:52,461
Good-bye, The Edge's real phone number

600
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,953
that even Bono doesn't have.

601
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:56,817
And most importantly,
I put physical distance

602
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,878
between me and my old life.

603
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,525
Book me a flight to Tibet.

604
00:27:00,615 --> 00:27:02,383
I'm going to live
in a Buddhist monastery.

605
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:04,168
I need to get out of the spotlight.

606
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:06,615
Copy that, I'll see
what jets are available.

607
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,383
- No, I'm flying commercial.
- Okay.

608
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,336
- First class, I assume?
- No.

609
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,995
I'm a woman of the people now.

610
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,689
Comfort Plus.

611
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:23,416
And there, in that humble monastery,

612
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:25,812
thousands of miles
from the meaningless concerns

613
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:27,352
of high society,

614
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:30,650
I embarked upon
a quest for enlightenment.

615
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:34,120
I learned to embrace
a life of simplicity.

616
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:36,193
I meditated.

617
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:38,799
I worked.

618
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:41,368
I gave back to Mother Earth.

619
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,360
And I slept.

620
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:47,434
My soul had never felt so nourished,

621
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,204
until one day,
my former life came knocking

622
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:52,771
at the open space
where a door would have been

623
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,597
if we were given any privacy.

624
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:59,687
Yo, is that Tahani Al-Jamil?
Man, it totes is you!

625
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:02,443
What up? I'm Colby, "Squalor News."

626
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,232
What are you doing in this monastery?

627
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,530
Oh, we're doing
a new show about poverty,

628
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:09,790
drug lords, gun running,
weird-ass restaurants,

629
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:12,049
skateboarding, oh, and also genocide.

630
00:28:12,116 --> 00:28:13,796
It's called "Society is F'ed."

631
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,195
What are you doing here, though?

632
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,731
Is this where you came after
your sister saved your life?

633
00:28:17,883 --> 00:28:22,687
I am living here as a way to
shed my desire for attention.

634
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,434
Toigh, that's what's up!
You got to shed that, right?

635
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:27,006
But listen, if you ever want us to do

636
00:28:27,047 --> 00:28:30,250
like a monster profile
on you and your monk junk,

637
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:31,999
we would be honored AF.

638
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,967
I think people
would be supes interested

639
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:35,860
in what you're doing here, for real.

640
00:28:36,017 --> 00:28:38,664
Look, here's my card. Think about it.

641
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,904
Of course, I never
called him to do that profile

642
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,524
because I didn't pursue
a life of tranquility

643
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,092
to get in front of a camera.

644
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:50,203
I did it to get out of the spotlight.

645
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:52,331
And that's what my book is about...

646
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:55,981
shedding your need
for validation from others.

647
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:02,775
Publisher says you'll hit

648
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,279
2 million copies sold by next week.

649
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:09,222
Your "582 Questions With" video
was nominated for a BAFTA.

650
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:11,807
- That's fun.
- Also, they want you for "Oprah."

651
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:13,140
"Oprah" is off the air.

652
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,415
No, they want you
to take over for Oprah.

653
00:29:15,501 --> 00:29:17,291
Also, this investor wants to meet you.

654
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,454
I checked him out, he's legit.

655
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:22,662
Tahani. Gordon Indigo.

656
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,925
I just have to say
you are so inspiring.

657
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:27,166
Aw.

658
00:29:27,607 --> 00:29:28,814
Namaste.

659
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,441
I mean, you really have
all these idiots fooled.

660
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:32,806
- Excuse me?
- Listen.

661
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,483
I'm sure you're already
rolling in dough

662
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,485
from this incredible scam,

663
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:38,244
but have you thought about merch?

664
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,980
Because we could, uh,
we could partner here.

665
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:43,082
I made a fortune selling Nirvana Orbs,

666
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:45,080
which is to say,

667
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:48,281
driving range golf balls
that I painted silver.

668
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:51,538
- That's awful.
- No, it's healing.

669
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,327
Wink.

670
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:55,662
You should be selling
whatever crap you can think of,

671
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:56,929
because these people will buy it.

672
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:58,568
- That is quite enough.
- Hm?

673
00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:00,774
And how dare you insinuate
that I'm not authentic?

674
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,134
I finished signing your headshots.

675
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:05,794
- Oh, not now.
- Ms. Al-Jamil, it's okay.

676
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,533
You and I are the same.
I love what you're doing here.

677
00:30:09,797 --> 00:30:11,598
You get to be rich and famous

678
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:14,464
and not have to do any
of the work of helping people.

679
00:30:14,615 --> 00:30:18,405
But I am helping people.
You need to go right now.

680
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:20,703
Suit yourself.
Look, if you change your mind,

681
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:22,995
I'm online. Just Google "crystals"

682
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,105
that prevent erectile dysfunction."

683
00:30:26,587 --> 00:30:29,304
I'm sorry, but Ms. Al-Jamil
doesn't have time

684
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,365
to participate in an ethical study

685
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:33,593
at some random university.

686
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,828
If you want to meet her,
you can sign up

687
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:37,921
for the "Get Out
of the Spotlight" cruise,

688
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:41,483
with special guests
Deepak Chopra and Will.I.Am.

689
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,146
Hello? This is Tahani Al-Jamil.

690
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:48,513
Oh, hi, I didn't think
I'd actually get you.

691
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:52,729
My name is Chidi Anagonye,
and I'm doing an academic study

692
00:30:52,753 --> 00:30:56,336
on near-death experiences
and ethical decision-making.

693
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,905
I read an article about you...
Will it help people?

694
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,695
That's all I want to know.
Will this help people?

695
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:05,772
Yes, I... I think so.
I... I mean, that's the goal.

696
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:08,874
Send me the info.
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

697
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:12,684
Wow.

698
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:15,162
But how had you
learned about me, I wonder?

699
00:31:15,186 --> 00:31:17,112
A professor I'd never heard of

700
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:20,206
named Charles Brainman
sent me an article about you.

701
00:31:20,232 --> 00:31:22,633
Said you'd be perfect for our study.

702
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,473
Well, welcome to Australia.

703
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,974
Oh, if you need a place to
crash while you get settled,

704
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,800
my motel has a pull-out sofa.

705
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,390
Although, as I say that,
and I look at you

706
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:34,027
and your whole thing,
I realize that's absurd,

707
00:31:34,051 --> 00:31:36,300
and you should probably
just get your own place.

708
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:39,499
Yes, I... I think that's best.

709
00:31:39,587 --> 00:31:42,188
- But... but thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:47,865
Three down, one to go.

711
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,391
Sup, bud? I've been looking for you.

712
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,485
Oh, sorry. Are these your rocks?

713
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:59,522
No, look. My name is Zach Pizazz.

714
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,457
International talent scout.

715
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:04,384
I've been tracking
your dance troupe, man.

716
00:32:04,427 --> 00:32:06,217
I think you really got the goods.

717
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,308
I want you to come on down to Australia

718
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:09,499
and start a new crew, all right?

719
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:10,967
I'll pay for everything.

720
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:12,839
You may have a few other
obligations, but basically...

721
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:15,279
Uh, thanks, but no thanks, man.

722
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:18,304
- I'm done with dancing.
- But wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

723
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:20,330
You heard what my name was, right?

724
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,258
Zach Pizazz?

725
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:24,521
My life is just
kind of messed up right now.

726
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,643
I had a really tough year.

727
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:29,552
I'm sorry.

728
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:32,856
Want to talk about it?
I'm a pretty good listener.

729
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:37,656
Well, my year started about a year ago.

730
00:32:40,255 --> 00:32:42,331
Pillboi, I can't breathe,
and I'm freaking out,

731
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,434
and I'm almost out of whip-its!
Pillboi!

732
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:46,535
- Buongiorno.

733
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,160
Buongiorno.

734
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,052
- Yo, what happened?
- I couldn't breathe.

735
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,913
The snorkel must have been broken.

736
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,714
Yo, that sucks.

737
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:01,752
- You ready to get back in there?
- No, man.

738
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:03,552
We're not doing this no more.

739
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,554
I almost died trying to rob
a Mexican restaurant.

740
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:10,233
I have to change my life.

741
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:15,464
I know what I'm going to do.

742
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:22,705
I'm going to win
this dance competition.

743
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,674
So you didn't see
any other posters there?

744
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,476
No, don't think so. Why?

745
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:29,579
Doesn't matter. Continue.

746
00:33:29,614 --> 00:33:32,581
Homies, I almost died yesterday.

747
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,264
But we've been given a second chance.

748
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:38,175
Three months from today,
on this very stage

749
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:40,624
in the Carmen Electra auditorium,

750
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:42,502
right here at the Smith & Wesson

751
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,615
Performing Arts Center
and ATV Repair Shop,

752
00:33:45,745 --> 00:33:49,941
we are going to win
this dance competition.

753
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:53,502
How, you ask? By working.

754
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:57,280
We are going to eat, breathe,
and vape dance.

755
00:33:57,307 --> 00:34:00,242
I want you thinking about dance 24/7.

756
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,037
That means every day, you think
20 thoughts about dance

757
00:34:03,062 --> 00:34:04,948
for seven minutes.

758
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:06,778
And if you can't promise me
that you'll give

759
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:09,019
this dance crew
everything that you've got,

760
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:11,787
then you can walk out that door.

761
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,024
Right now.

762
00:34:14,548 --> 00:34:16,417
Yeah, okay. I'm out.

763
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,627
What? Come on, Donkey Doug.

764
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:19,948
After all we've been through?

765
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:21,597
Listen, you know you're my boy,

766
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:23,100
but this sounds like a lot of work.

767
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:24,881
Good luck.

768
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,156
Pew, pew.

769
00:34:29,073 --> 00:34:31,108
Donkey Doug out!

770
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,260
Damn, that's a tough blow.

771
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:37,948
But now that those guys are
no longer members of our crew,

772
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:40,106
we can legally rob their houses.

773
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:41,493
No, Little Peanut.

774
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,986
We're going to do this the right way.

775
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,238
No more crime,
and if you don't like that,

776
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:47,303
you can walk out that door.

777
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:49,135
Right now.

778
00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:54,410
What? Co... Oh, come on...

779
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:58,821
We still got like 35 people,
so let's get to work.

780
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,189
Quick announcement.

781
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:05,430
Will the owner of a 1998 Toyota Tercel

782
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:07,885
with golden pythons
painted on both sides,

783
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:11,847
license plate GOT-MILF
please see an usher.

784
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,836
Your car has exploded.

785
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:15,738
All right, ya'll ready
for the next act?

786
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:20,463
Please give it up right now
for Dance Dance Resolution!

787
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:42,537
In the six-year history
of this competition,

788
00:35:42,562 --> 00:35:46,106
no crew has ever received a
perfect score from our judges.

789
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,723
That changed tonight.

790
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:49,390
But before we get to that,

791
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:52,528
Dance Dance Resolution
has been disqualified.

792
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:55,501
What? No, why?

793
00:35:55,548 --> 00:35:58,137
Because you have 40 people onstage.

794
00:35:58,216 --> 00:35:59,669
The limit is eight.

795
00:35:59,812 --> 00:36:02,129
Also, one of your members
tried to carjack me

796
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,647
- on my way in here.
- No, that was Donkey Doug,

797
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:06,660
and he's not a part
of our crew anymore.

798
00:36:06,685 --> 00:36:07,986
We win! We win!

799
00:36:08,012 --> 00:36:10,513
We win, we win, we win!

800
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:14,151
No, again, you are disqualified.

801
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:16,486
And the winner is...

802
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:18,821
Panther Blood!

803
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,589
And the winner is...

804
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,059
Suck Monsters!

805
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,028
And the winner is...

806
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:26,713
Nobody.

807
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,865
All teams are disqualified
due to violence.

808
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:33,702
Okay, well, we're out of rent money.

809
00:36:33,868 --> 00:36:37,841
So remember that thing I said
about no more crime?

810
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:40,256
That's over now. Go do crime.

811
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:43,376
Yep, he just confessed to the robbery.

812
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,847
- Damn it!
- That was easy.

813
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,698
Look, please let me go.

814
00:36:46,758 --> 00:36:47,867
I only did it to pay rent

815
00:36:47,892 --> 00:36:49,633
for my dance crew's rehearsal space.

816
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,289
Oh, well then, you're in luck.

817
00:36:51,314 --> 00:36:52,756
We only arrest people for robbery

818
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:54,649
if they don't have a reason.

819
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,560
Sorry it took me so long
to bail you out.

820
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,562
No, it was my fault.

821
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,117
I shouldn't have used my one phone call

822
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:03,437
to prank the police department.

823
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:06,068
Man, a year ago, I almost died,

824
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:08,972
and I'm exactly the same
as I was before.

825
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:11,274
- A failure.
- You're not a failure.

826
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:12,943
You're a dreamer.

827
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:15,912
Look, I like my job
at the old folk's home.

828
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:17,747
Those old biddies are sweet,

829
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:20,749
and sometimes they give me
what they think are candy

830
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,919
but are really loose Vicodin.

831
00:37:23,473 --> 00:37:25,088
But when I'm with you,

832
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:27,479
I feel like the sky's the limit.

833
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:32,031
I feel like someday, I'll be
able to buy my own Vicodin.

834
00:37:32,531 --> 00:37:36,899
And it'll never turn out
to actually be laxatives.

835
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:40,236
Thanks, dog,
but if my life ended today,

836
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:42,272
what would my legacy be?

837
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:44,589
Sure, I did a wheelie on a dirt bike

838
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:46,575
through an entire Waffle House,

839
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:48,758
and I was once interviewed on the news

840
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,780
for finding a foot on the beach.

841
00:37:51,095 --> 00:37:54,984
But yo, other than that, I have
no truly great accomplishments.

842
00:37:55,323 --> 00:37:56,620
Bro.

843
00:37:56,836 --> 00:38:00,122
I'm only saying this
because I love you.

844
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:02,633
Do you want a Vicodin right now?

845
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:05,635
So I walked out of that bar,

846
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:08,765
came down to this wharf,
threw a rock at a snake,

847
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,033
met a guy named Zach Pizazz,

848
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:13,327
talked to him about
my crazy year that I've had

849
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:15,305
which started when I
was locked in a safe.

850
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,307
No, that was me. I'm Zach Pizazz.

851
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,776
- We're caught up now.
- Oh, yeah.

852
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,845
- Yeah.
- A year ago, if you had

853
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,948
asked me to run a dance crew
in Atlantis...

854
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:27,850
- Australia.
- I would have said yes for sure.

855
00:38:27,946 --> 00:38:33,189
But now, and I know this sounds crazy,

856
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:36,039
but I'm starting to think
there might be more to life

857
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:39,004
than amateur
street dancing competitions.

858
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:43,332
It's funny, but I know
exactly what you mean.

859
00:38:43,874 --> 00:38:47,372
My goal in life used to be
completely different, too.

860
00:38:48,356 --> 00:38:49,838
I used to, um...

861
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:52,890
rep this crew called the Demons.

862
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,423
Whoa, I remember you guys!

863
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:56,890
Didn't you all die when someone brought

864
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,858
a hammerhead shark into your hot tub?

865
00:38:59,097 --> 00:39:00,684
Different Demons.

866
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:04,695
The point is, I had to leave
my old crew behind, you know?

867
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,115
But I met new friends
who helped me become

868
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,926
a better... person.

869
00:39:11,258 --> 00:39:13,102
Look, I know this group of people

870
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,863
who are also searching for meaning.

871
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,399
They might be able to help you
find what you're looking for.

872
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:20,002
What do you think?
You want to go meet them?

873
00:39:20,622 --> 00:39:23,276
Yeah, that sounds great.

874
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:25,954
Do we have to leave right now?

875
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:28,553
My friend gave me a pill
that I realized one second ago

876
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,080
was definitely a laxative.

877
00:39:30,298 --> 00:39:32,249
No, go, go.

878
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,834
Well, that is the last time

879
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:37,196
I'll need to head back down there.

880
00:39:37,347 --> 00:39:38,754
So to thank you for your help,

881
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:41,091
I brought you back
something from Earth.

882
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,193
A little token of my appreciation.

883
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:48,122
It keeps your antimatter
warmer for longer.

884
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:54,137
- It's a frog.
- Yeah.

885
00:39:54,464 --> 00:39:56,238
- There's a frog on it!
- Yeah.

886
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,073
Right there, it's a frog!

887
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,776
Oh, man, it's green. It's classic.

888
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,707
Oh, this guy's a jumper. You can tell.

889
00:40:02,798 --> 00:40:05,401
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

890
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:10,171
Wow, that really went over big!

891
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,959
How's Jason? Is he still cute?

892
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,553
- Oh, he looks about the same.
- That sounds cute.

893
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:19,627
- Hey, guys.
- Ooh, hey, Judge.

894
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:21,716
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

895
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:23,377
- How's it going?
- So good.

896
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,189
I mean, everything is going
according to plan,

897
00:40:25,242 --> 00:40:27,883
and nothing is going
differently from the plan.

898
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:30,560
Yes, that's a very
not weird way to put it.

899
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:33,001
I'm just stretching my legs.

900
00:40:33,113 --> 00:40:36,526
Just binged like
300 episodes of "NCIS."

901
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:37,992
- Oof!
- You know, I'm not

902
00:40:38,026 --> 00:40:39,169
a human woman,

903
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:42,229
but that Mark Harmon can get it.

904
00:40:42,432 --> 00:40:43,999
You know what I'm saying?

905
00:40:44,182 --> 00:40:46,783
Speaking of human cutiepies,
how's that Chidi doing?

906
00:40:46,874 --> 00:40:47,943
Oh, sorry, Judge. Let me just...

907
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:50,126
Ooh, hey, you know what you would love

908
00:40:50,151 --> 00:40:51,274
- if you like Mark Harmon?
- Yeah?

909
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:52,441
"Stealing Home."

910
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:54,597
He is very sexy in "Stealing Home"

911
00:40:54,622 --> 00:40:56,187
according to the private
thoughts of more than

912
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:57,711
7 million Caucasian women.

913
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:00,048
Oh, hot tip. Thanks, girl.

914
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:01,468
You guys want to come with?

915
00:41:01,564 --> 00:41:03,084
- Ooh.
- We can watch together.

916
00:41:03,118 --> 00:41:04,588
I can whip up some nachos.

917
00:41:04,613 --> 00:41:08,017
- I am incapable of eating, so.
- Suit yourselves.

918
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:10,742
- Party poopers.
- Ah, party poopers!

919
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:12,260
I guess it'll just be
me and Mark, then.

920
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:14,461
Naughty, naughty.

921
00:41:16,064 --> 00:41:17,432
Oh, boy.

922
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:19,752
Michael, we almost just got busted.

923
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:22,122
Yeah, but we didn't,
and more importantly,

924
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:24,372
Jason just arrived in Australia.

925
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:26,274
The four of them are finally together.

926
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:29,310
Oh, we did it, Janet!
We got away with it.

927
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:35,894
So this is our MRI machine.
Oh, don't... don't touch that.

928
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,229
Each of you will get a chance
in here eventually.

929
00:41:38,356 --> 00:41:40,354
Hopefully, none of you
is claustrophobic.

930
00:41:40,388 --> 00:41:41,704
Clausterphobic?

931
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:43,751
Who would ever be scared
of Santa Claus?

932
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:46,528
Oh! The Jewish.

933
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,240
Are you from Florida?

934
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,897
- Jacksonville.
- Yeah.

935
00:41:49,932 --> 00:41:52,229
That should be fine for me.
It's roughly the same size

936
00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:54,836
as Nicole Kidman's
cryogenic anti-aging chamber,

937
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,504
and I've never had a problem in there.

938
00:41:56,937 --> 00:41:58,173
I'll be okay, too.

939
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,008
Kinda of reminds me
of the home tanning booth

940
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,459
I lost my virginity in.

941
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,620
Wow, I cannot wait to take
a look at these three brains.

942
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,180
Oh, forgot to mention.

943
00:42:06,214 --> 00:42:08,693
There's one more person
who will be joining us.

944
00:42:08,834 --> 00:42:10,852
Seems like a really interesting guy.

945
00:42:10,887 --> 00:42:12,821
He was almost run over
by a train a few months ago.

946
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:14,488
Heard about the study,
emailed me last night.

947
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:17,524
This doesn't make any sense.

948
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:23,231
They're all there. What's going on?

949
00:42:23,722 --> 00:42:26,367
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

950
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,376
Something bad, Janet.

951
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:31,839
Something very dark...

952
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,713
and evil.

953
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:35,756
Oh, yes. Come on in.

954
00:42:35,912 --> 00:42:39,470
- Everyone, this is Trevor.
- Hey, guys.

955
00:42:39,537 --> 00:42:42,050
It is so great to meet you.
