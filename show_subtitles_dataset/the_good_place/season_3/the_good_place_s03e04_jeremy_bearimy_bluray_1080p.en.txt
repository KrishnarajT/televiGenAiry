1
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:05,476
Let's just try t...

2
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:09,271
Your key is ringing.

3
00:00:10,658 --> 00:00:11,865
I have a question for you.

4
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,613
Are you out of your damn mind?

5
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:15,861
Your Honour,
look at it from my point of view.

6
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:18,826
I have never been this angry in my life

7
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,075
which is the age of the universe!

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,330
I understand, but saving the souls of these
four humans is more important, so...

9
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:28,711
we're not coming back until we do.

10
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,215
Oh, don't you even try coming back here
cos when you walk through that door

11
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:34,095
I am gonna be waiting for you.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,223
Sorry, Judge, I think you're breaking up.

13
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:38,891
That's impossible.
It's a magical key, you dick.

14
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:41,637
What are you doing? I can see you!

15
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:43,939
This is perfect.

16
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:46,437
We're right near Chidi's office,
and as far as I can tell

17
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:47,976
the whole floor is abandoned.

18
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,062
What do they use it for? Storage?

19
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:52,106
- No, this is the journalism department.
- Huh.

20
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,696
Bad for the world, good for us.

21
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:58,328
So, somehow, with none of our powers

22
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:02,616
we have to keep the group intact
and monitor their ethical progress.

23
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:07,204
- So, how do we do that?
- Not sure.

24
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:09,623
There's no way to track people's actual
point totals

25
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:11,712
only the Accountants
have that information, but...

26
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:15,716
I did install cameras and microphones,
so at least we can keep our eye on them.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,597
- Let's get peepin'!
- Ho!

28
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,635
Oh, no. Not a great start.

29
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:24,229
Eleanor farted
and then she blamed it on her chair.

30
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:26,681
That's gonna cost her at least a few points.

31
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,688
There's a bolt missing or something...

32
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:32,192
Before we begin,
Trevor is dropping out of the study.

33
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,447
He sent me an email last night.

34
00:01:34,492 --> 00:01:38,736
"I'm sad to inform you that I am too ugly
and stupid to be in the study

35
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,654
and I'm going home to my mummy."

36
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,868
That was me. I wrote that email!

37
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,831
That's too bad, but we press on.
We're on to stage two of the study.

38
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:49,249
I'm going to teach you some
philosophical principals

39
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:52,917
and then we will explore how those ideas have
affected your personal moral machineries.

40
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,130
Sorry, Eleanor, did you say something?

41
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:58,180
No, it's my chair.
It's got this weird design...

42
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:00,307
- Your chair smells bad.
- I know!

43
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:03,810
See? Another person who agrees,
it's the chair.

44
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:12,435
Great news, everyone!

45
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,023
The funding from the Neuroscience department
came through!

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,112
And you blew it all on cupcakes?

47
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:20,076
Exactly what I would have done.

48
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:21,162
Respect.

49
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,413
- Eleanor?
- Ah... I'm good.

50
00:02:23,624 --> 00:02:27,868
I try to avoid pointless group activities,
you know, like office Christmas parties

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
or jury duty.

52
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:32,335
To me, the single most awful sound
in the universe is that mangled

53
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:35,296
opening note of your co-workers singing
"Happy Birthday".

54
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:36,460
Cool stance.

55
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:39,171
Counterpoint -
these are delicious free cupcakes.

56
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:40,509
Get over yourself and eat one.

57
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:41,976
Fine.

58
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:43,933
Oh! You guys,
let's take a picture!

59
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:46,891
Everyone get in, get in,
and say, uh... Oh!

60
00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:49,355
Say "ventromedial prefrontal cortex"!

61
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:52,608
Jaguars rule!

62
00:02:56,991 --> 00:03:00,075
Hey, Teach? I've been having
so much fun here, but...

63
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:04,238
I didn't plan to stay in Australia
this long, and I'm super broke.

64
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,493
Any idea where I can get a part-time gig?

65
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:10,021
- What kind of work are you looking for?
- Well, I'm really good at telemarketing.

66
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:14,255
I can usually guess how long to microwave
food without looking at the box.

67
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,499
I'd say those are my two main skills.

68
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:17,552
OK.

69
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,502
- Dang it!
- I'll see what I can do.

70
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:21,967
If Eleanor has to get a job,
she'll miss class

71
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:24,053
and that'll slow down her progress.

72
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:29,291
Are you sure we should be doing this?
It kind of feels like cheating.

73
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:30,931
No, no, it's not cheating.

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,895
Think of us as a snowplough,
clearing a path for Eleanor

75
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:39,527
so she can more easily drive along
the road of improvement.

76
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:42,739
Ooh, I love that!
You really painted a picture there.

77
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,239
G'day, how can I help you?

78
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:47,031
One scratch-off lottery ticket, please!

79
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:50,124
Oh! Not that one. Keep going.

80
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,080
Keep going. Keep going.

81
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,047
These tickets were printed
before we got down here.

82
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,450
I know which ones are the winners!

83
00:03:56,508 --> 00:03:57,589
And... stop!

84
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:00,844
That's the one. Good ol' lucky
number 186 from the bottom!

85
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,971
- Here you go.
- Also!

86
00:04:03,015 --> 00:04:05,895
That bathroom key that you lost
nine months ago, slid under the register.

87
00:04:06,185 --> 00:04:09,974
And the woman that you think is your aunt
is actually your mum.

88
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:11,022
OK, bye!

89
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,024
You guys, this is nuts.

90
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:19,442
This morning, I found a lottery ticket
on the ground outside my apartment.

91
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:21,067
I scratched it off...

92
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:24,401
and I won $18,000!

93
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:25,952
- Wow!
- That's amazing!

94
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:27,324
Better luck next time.

95
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:33,752
Yes. Sorry, from context, I see
that is actually a large sum of money.

96
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:44,554
Jason? You OK there, mate?

97
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:46,388
No.

98
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:50,511
I have to watch the Jaguar games alone,
on my computer at like three in the morning

99
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,849
on Mondays. It's so annoying.

100
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:54,389
Everything here is in a...

101
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,059
I don't know how to describe it, like...

102
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:59,356
a different zone of time.

103
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:01,525
No, that sounds stupid.

104
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:03,239
A different clock land.

105
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,099
I'll watch the game with you, Jason!

106
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,904
I enjoy American football -
I actually dated a player once.

107
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:11,991
But he wasn't my type,
so I set him up with my friend Gisele...

108
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:15,160
- BÃ¼ndchen.
- Yeah, we got it. We always get it.

109
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:16,213
Awesome!

110
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:19,378
But if you want to watch with me,
you have to learn my Jaguars cheer.

111
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,795
It goes, "Let's go, Jags!

112
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,006
Kick their ass! Yeah!"

113
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:26,463
Do you think you can learn that
by the weekend?

114
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,472
I shall do my best.

115
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,016
Nice! See you then!

116
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:34,304
- Why do you want to watch football with Jason?
- I don't, really.

117
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:37,520
But I am, these days,
as you might say in America

118
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:39,229
"mad horny".

119
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:40,519
Oh!

120
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:42,649
- OK, well...
- Oh, boy.

121
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,107
No judgements, babe. He's a straight hottie.

122
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,948
- You want to smash Jason, go smash.
- Tahani getting together with Jason

123
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,076
even casually, could tear this group apart.

124
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:53,994
We have to nip this in the bud.

125
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:57,540
Well, it makes me slightly uneasy
to interfere in the personal life

126
00:05:57,588 --> 00:06:00,581
of the man that I am secretly in love with
and a woman I admire

127
00:06:00,632 --> 00:06:03,249
but if you think we should,
I-I'm not gonna argue.

128
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:05,919
Time to break out
the ol' snowplough again, Janet.

129
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:10,052
Let's find Tahani a loving,
supportive companion.

130
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,018
Great idea.

131
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:13,261
Oh, you know, this is not as crucial
to the mission

132
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:17,807
but I'd also love to arrange for them to get
better computers, help them work faster.

133
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:21,351
If I'm going to the mall anyway, I might
as well pick Jason up some jean shorts

134
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:24,062
the kind with the frayed edges,
where you can see the pockets

135
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:25,114
coming out the bottom?

136
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:29,488
So that he can... study better.

137
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:30,828
Sure.

138
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,416
Tahani? Is that you?

139
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:40,416
Larry Hemsworth? My goodness!

140
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:43,999
That's so funny, I just got a call from
the restaurant about a jacket I left here

141
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:46,418
and now here you are!

142
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:48,128
I can't believe you remember me.

143
00:06:48,263 --> 00:06:50,425
Of course I remember you! We dated.

144
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:53,512
I know, I just never expect anyone
to remember me.

145
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:57,053
Because I'm only 6ft 4",
and I have one of those forgettable faces.

146
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:00,474
Well, uh... I'm sure you're busy,
probably don't wanna talk to me.

147
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:02,859
I get it, I wouldn't either,
I'm as dull as a rock.

148
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:05,938
Ugh. Even that analogy was boring,
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:08,398
I'm so dull, and I'm ugly,
I'm like a rock... urgh!

150
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:11,735
- Stupid Larry! Stop talking about rocks!
- No, no, Larry, please!

151
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,830
It's lovely to see you.
Sit down, let's catch up!

152
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,657
How are Chris and Liam and Luke?

153
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:19,785
Sorry, no.

154
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:21,578
I won't mention your brothers again.

155
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,295
As long as you don't mention my sister!

156
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,127
Oh!

157
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:27,129
Mm-mm...

158
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:29,419
Who are you? Do you work here?

159
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,595
Your name is Montgomery Wycoff.

160
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:35,137
Your ex-wife Samantha still loves you
but she's afraid to call.

161
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:37,597
You must show her your poetry.

162
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:40,097
Go to her. Go to her!

163
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:47,395
- Looks like you had a good night!
- I did.

164
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:50,691
You and Jason, imagine that.

165
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:52,866
To be fair, I have.

166
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,282
Actually, I was with an ex-boyfriend.

167
00:07:55,455 --> 00:08:00,416
I ran into him unexpectedly,
and the reunion was a "smashing" success.

168
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,410
It's a pun, you see.

169
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:04,871
- We had intercourse.
- Yeah, again, I always get it.

170
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,583
I do feel bad, though. I completely forgot
about watching the game with Jason.

171
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:10,510
Homies, guess what?

172
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:13,384
Yesterday I got a Facebook invite
to the Australia chapter

173
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,806
of the Jacksonville Jaguars Fan Club!

174
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:17,179
Yeah, I think he's over it.

175
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:21,055
Me and two other dudes just watched the Jags
annihilate the Texans!

176
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,898
It was super fun, I'm completely wasted.

177
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:27,694
I gotta go barf one last time,
and then I'll be ready to learn philosophy!

178
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:29,987
Duval!

179
00:08:30,324 --> 00:08:33,067
OK, not perfect,
but the pros outweigh the cons.

180
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Agreed.

181
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:39,323
âª Happy birthday, dear Chidi âª

182
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,451
You guys, this whole year has been amazing
for all of us.

183
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:45,628
I mean, literally every aspect of our lives
has improved.

184
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:48,377
Well, I don't know about every aspect...

185
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:49,840
SuperBoard, activate!

186
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:52,176
Good morning, Professor Anagonye.

187
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:54,087
I have your lesson plan ready to go.

188
00:08:54,181 --> 00:08:57,299
SuperBoard,
some triumphant announcement music, please.

189
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:01,807
Last night, Larry Hemsworth proposed to me

190
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:04,643
and we're moving back to London
to begin planning the wedding!

191
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:06,398
- Whoa!
- Holy smokes!

192
00:09:06,443 --> 00:09:07,479
Janet! Red alert!

193
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:10,441
All snowploughing has to stop immediately!

194
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,523
So, don't give Blake Beartles to Jason?

195
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:22,039
How are you even lugging this thing around?
I'm not sure I could bench this much weight.

196
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,751
Well, girls in my social class
begin ring-training at a very young age.

197
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:29,627
Oh, I'm throwing a little engagement party
tonight at my Airbnb.

198
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:32,299
It's very last minute, just come as you are.

199
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:39,091
I guess all these people...
came as they were?

200
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:43,136
Hello, everyone! I'm so glad you made it!

201
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,314
Holy crap, Tahani,
you found this place on Airbnb?

202
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:49,480
Oh, no. I... I see why you're confused.

203
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:52,482
I used Heir BnB. "H-E-I-R."

204
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:57,367
It's an app for heirs and heiresses
where we swap mansions, private islands

205
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,360
blimp hangars, that sort of thing.

206
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:04,158
Anyway, everyone,
I want you to meet Larry Hemsworth!

207
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:06,831
Oh! The legendary study group.

208
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:10,789
I'm sorry it's taken me so long
to build up the courage to meet you.

209
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:13,044
I guess you can see why.

210
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:18,134
Is he ashamed at having a perfect jawline
and 0% body fat?

211
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,218
Still can't believe she wants to marry me...

212
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:23,226
A dumb old paediatric surgeon
who barely has an eight-pack.

213
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,603
Do you know what you look like?

214
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:30,562
More importantly, did Miley Cyrus
write the song "Wrecking Ball"

215
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:31,859
about Chris's brother Liam?

216
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:33,821
Wonderful.

217
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:36,443
More questions about my talented brothers.

218
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,940
God forbid there's a single day
when I'm the special one.

219
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:42,287
Oh, sweetheart, don't go!
You're important too!

220
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:45,490
Fixing babies' spines
is just as valuable as acting!

221
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:48,831
Tahani booked a flight
for tomorrow morning, so...

222
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:52,039
this party is our only chance
to talk them out of moving.

223
00:10:52,257 --> 00:10:54,374
Maybe we should just let them
go their separate ways

224
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:56,612
and hope that they learned enough
to get into the Good Place.

225
00:10:56,636 --> 00:11:00,050
No, we know what'll happen -
the group splits up, they're screwed. No.

226
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,885
We have to isolate Larry and convince him
that he needs to stay in Australia.

227
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:06,970
Time to get into character, as...

228
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:08,875
Nathaniel Cookswell, mate!

229
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:10,640
Caterer to the stars!

230
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:11,734
Ah.

231
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:14,144
Maybe no accent?

232
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:16,822
Fine.

233
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,402
Vegemite canapÃ©?

234
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,317
Oh, might as well.

235
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:24,028
Mummy was right.
I'll always be the chubby one.

236
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:28,575
Good day, mate! Nathaniel Cookswell.

237
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:30,289
- Caterer to the stars.
- Mm...

238
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,371
Is it true you're moving to England?

239
00:11:32,547 --> 00:11:34,379
Yeah. Fly out tomorrow.

240
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,207
Oh. Ooh, that's a long trip.

241
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:39,552
Well, you must be a confident man,
uprooting your life like that.

242
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,587
You should stay here in Sydney.

243
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:45,891
It's such a dynamic international city
that you've only seen 4.8% percent of...

244
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,140
probably.

245
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,224
I reckon I know what's going on here.
You aren't real caterers, are you?

246
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:54,146
- Uh...
- Uh-uh...

247
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,519
Who do you work for? Australian Inquirer?

248
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,024
TM-Zed?

249
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,983
You just want us to stay here
so you can keep mocking me

250
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:03,321
"The hideous shame
of the Hemsworth family."

251
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:05,494
- Aw...
- Tahani sees through all that.

252
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:09,078
And I can't wait until we move far away
from the likes of you

253
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,417
and I can finally take her last name.

254
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:16,998
Hate to say it,
but the group probably needs a new member.

255
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:19,004
I dunno how we'll ever replace Tahani.

256
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:21,635
Do you think Margot Robbie
is into philosophy?

257
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,301
Actually, Tahani's announcement
made us take stock.

258
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:28,139
You know, Simone and I need time
to analyse the data

259
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:31,062
apply for grants -
we've kind of hit a natural stopping point.

260
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:34,001
Yeah, and the next step would be to repeat
the experiment with new subjects

261
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,106
you know, compare results.

262
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:38,732
Wait, what are you saying?
That... the study's over?

263
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,156
We're... splitting up?

264
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:43,491
No, no, no. We're just taking
a break, for...

265
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:45,193
a year or so.

266
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,866
And I'm sure you're all anxious
to get back home.

267
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:51,366
Yeah, I got a lot of stuff
to get back to in Phoenix.

268
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:52,877
Like...

269
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:56,747
I have a free punch card
at my spray tan place.

270
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:00,834
They'll do my left side for free... so...

271
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:04,386
No, no, no, no!

272
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,676
The whole group is splintering!

273
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,469
OK, new emergency plan.

274
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:11,139
I'll deal with Eleanor,
I... I... I know it's risky

275
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:12,845
but I don't think she'll recognise me.

276
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:14,834
And I'll deal with Sweet Cheeks.
I mean, Jason's butt!

277
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,599
I mean, Jason.

278
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:25,611
- Shrimp?
- Always.

279
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:29,787
- So... how do you know Miss Al-Jamil?
- Mmm.

280
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:32,706
- You work with her at the university?
- Used to.

281
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:34,416
That study is done-zo.

282
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:37,416
I was finally starting to figure things out

283
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:41,583
and now I have to start over from scratch.

284
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:43,093
Again.

285
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:46,754
Boy, I know how that goes -
not wanting something to end.

286
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:52,136
Feeling like your little team is the
last thing standing between you and oblivion

287
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:55,475
that at any moment,
the universe could fold up around you

288
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:59,400
and squeeze the last breath
from your dying lungs.

289
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:01,815
You're a caterer, right?

290
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,945
It's a very competitive industry.

291
00:14:04,074 --> 00:14:07,658
The-the point is, I bet that if the study
means that much to you

292
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:09,823
it means a lot to everyone else.

293
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,827
You're all just probably waiting
for someone to say it out loud.

294
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:17,313
You want some cocktail sauce with that?

295
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:24,001
I would like to acknowledge the wonderful
group of people who brought me here.

296
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:26,017
If I hadn't decided
to get out of the spotlight

297
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:29,343
of my "Get Out of the Spotlight" Tour,
and come here

298
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:33,761
and join the Brainy Bunch,
I never would have reconnected with Larry.

299
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:36,975
- Aww!
- So, to celebrate our group...

300
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:40,516
I had my favourite pÃ¢tissier whip this up.

301
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:43,835
Would any of you like to say a few words?

302
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,980
Eleanor!

303
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:47,235
Yay! Eleanor!

304
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,567
If nobody minds, uh...

305
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:52,445
I would like to address...

306
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:54,994
the people on this cake, I suppose.

307
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:59,836
I get that we all have meaningful lives
outside the study.

308
00:14:59,963 --> 00:15:03,331
Well, Tahani and Chidi do.
Jason and I are straight trash.

309
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,254
- Ka-kaw!
- But, just...

310
00:15:05,427 --> 00:15:09,216
I mean, think about how much progress
we've all made since that picture was taken.

311
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:15,219
I know that what we're doing is important,
and I'm not ready to stop.

312
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:17,641
And I don't think you guys are either.

313
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,645
So let's all stay here, and keep it going.

314
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:23,855
What do you say?

315
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:25,195
Eleanor!

316
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,694
That was absolutely... lovely.

317
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:31,860
It really was. And I am...
I'm so glad that this study

318
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,027
meant that much to you.

319
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:36,242
But, realistically...

320
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,311
That's cool. I get it.
No, you don't need to say it. I...

321
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:39,826
I got it. That's all she wrote. Cool.

322
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:42,211
Are you OK? I hope you're not mad.

323
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,331
No, I'm not mad. I'm actually laughing.

324
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:49,173
Because this whole study was a hilarious,
stupid, pointless joke

325
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:52,297
and now it's over, so let's hit the road.
I don't need you guys.

326
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:54,515
You don't need me,
and since you don't need me

327
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:57,602
I'm just gonna take the "me"
out of this cake.

328
00:15:58,563 --> 00:15:59,929
No!

329
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,188
Eleanor, please!

330
00:16:01,232 --> 00:16:03,002
Oh, sorry, the deed is done!

331
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:04,142
Pip pip, too late!

332
00:16:04,235 --> 00:16:05,851
Ah, farewell to you, my liege.

333
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:09,780
And a jolly good Saint Ploopington's Day
to all of you!

334
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:14,160
USA! USA! USA!

335
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,038
Eleanor? Is that you?

336
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:23,545
No.

337
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:28,215
Called a cab like 20 minutes ago.

338
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:32,796
It says it's ten kilometres away,
which is... I don't even know how far.

339
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,596
It's a little over six miles.

340
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:39,181
Is that why you came out here?
To scold me about the metric system?

341
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:41,513
No, I was about to call a cab myself.

342
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:44,974
I have an early class tomorrow.
Then I saw my friend hiding behind a plant

343
00:16:45,026 --> 00:16:47,894
and I got concerned,
then my friend lashed out at me again

344
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:51,610
so, I'm gonna take off and, uh,
leave her here with dirty leaves in her hair.

345
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,386
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

346
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,276
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, don't go.

347
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:02,287
You're a brain scientist.

348
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,457
Can you tell me why I did that in there?

349
00:17:05,547 --> 00:17:07,755
I mostly do clinical research
in neuroscience.

350
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:10,049
I don't really specialise
in temper tantrums.

351
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:13,336
Maybe you need a child psychologist,
or a binkie?

352
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,921
That's a solid burn. I deserved it.

353
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,848
I did. But please, can you help me?

354
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:19,804
Why did I do that?

355
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:21,685
OK, here's my guess.

356
00:17:22,313 --> 00:17:26,353
As humans evolved, the first big problem
we had to overcome was "me versus us"

357
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:30,103
learning to sacrifice a little individual
freedom for the benefit of a group.

358
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:33,402
You know, like sharing food and resources
so we don't starve

359
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,660
- or get eaten by tigers, things like that.
- OK, with you so far.

360
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:40,366
The next problem to overcome
was "us versus them"

361
00:17:40,415 --> 00:17:43,453
trying to see other groups,
different from ours, as equals.

362
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:45,330
That one, we're still struggling with.

363
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,254
It's why we have racism and nationalism,
and...

364
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,298
why fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin
hate fans of The Rock.

365
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:53,717
No, we hate The Rock
because he went Hollywood

366
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:57,005
and Stone Cold keeps it real,
so The Rock's fans are the real jabronis.

367
00:17:58,183 --> 00:17:59,515
Point made. Keep going.

368
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:01,968
Well, what's interesting about you is...

369
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:06,143
I don't think you ever got past
the "me versus us" stage.

370
00:18:06,316 --> 00:18:09,150
I mean, have you ever been part of a group
that you really cared about?

371
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:11,439
- I was in the Girl Scouts.
- Really?

372
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:16,316
Technically, I joined under a fake name
because I wanted to steal a bunch of cookies.

373
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:20,699
See? The Brainy Bunch is basically the first
group that became part of your self-identity

374
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:24,240
and now that's breaking up,
you're feeling this new kind of loss.

375
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,743
And you're scared
of going back to being alone.

376
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:29,666
I mean, that's just my guess -
the other possible medical diagnosis

377
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:31,874
is that you're just a bit of a dick.

378
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:37,215
Why don't you take my cab?

379
00:18:37,722 --> 00:18:40,260
I think "me" needs to go apologise to "us."

380
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,050
And thank you.

381
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:49,023
The point is...
I'm not really an "I'm sorry" type girl.

382
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:52,648
I'm more of a,
"It's your fault your car got keyed

383
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,153
in the movie theatre parking lot
because you wouldn't shut up

384
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:58,157
while watching John Wick"... type girl.

385
00:18:58,368 --> 00:19:01,031
But... I'm sorry that I freaked out.

386
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,203
Just really gonna miss you guys.

387
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,247
We're gonna miss you too.

388
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:09,331
Here's an idea - what if we all agree
to a yearly reunion?

389
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,544
And then that way,
The Brainy Bunch never dies!

390
00:19:11,756 --> 00:19:15,591
Each summer, we could all stay
in one of our respective houses

391
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:18,215
mega-yachts, ski chalets, what have you.

392
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:19,882
We should all meet up in Jacksonville!

393
00:19:20,014 --> 00:19:21,630
My house is right on the water.

394
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:24,266
It didn't used to be,
but the whole city is a swamp

395
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,051
- and it's sinking into the ocean!
- Woo!

396
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:27,681
Strong pitch, bud.

397
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:29,267
Next year in Jacksonville.

398
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:30,399
Yeah!

399
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,897
Uh, we might not want to wait a whole year -
it's sinking really fast.

400
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:36,187
We should have a toast!

401
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:39,277
OK, I think I figured out a plan
where they stay in Australia

402
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:42,193
and only five random
bystanders get hurt.

403
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,536
It's called "arson." Let's go!

404
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:47,702
Michael, no. We can't keep meddling forever.

405
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:51,331
It's time to park the snowplough,
and trust that the humans

406
00:19:51,379 --> 00:19:52,836
will make progress on their own.

407
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:55,755
This isn't like your afterlife
Neighbourhood, Michael.

408
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,010
You can't just reset things the moment
something doesn't go according to your plan.

409
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,714
Oh, Janet, you're a genius.

410
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:05,470
Correct. I know everything.

411
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,643
You just gave me this crazy idea.

412
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:10,437
It's so crazy, it just might... fail.
It'll probably fail.

413
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:14,525
But it also might work!
I open the door to the afterlife.

414
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,820
You keep a lookout,
while I break into the Judge's chamber

415
00:20:17,906 --> 00:20:21,650
and reset the timeline on Earth.
Then we do it all over again!

416
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:24,535
But correctly - we won't wait a year
to get them all together again.

417
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:26,070
We'll get the study going right away!

418
00:20:26,164 --> 00:20:28,372
Do you even know how to reset
the timeline on Earth?

419
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,913
No. I'm assuming that there's, you know...

420
00:20:32,086 --> 00:20:34,703
a knob or a... or a button or, you know,
maybe you...

421
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,692
maybe you unplug it
and then plug it right back in?

422
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:38,799
I-I don't... There's gotta be a way!

423
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,209
Michael, before you do this...

424
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:41,593
No! No more waiting.

425
00:20:41,804 --> 00:20:43,591
This is all we have, Janet.

426
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:47,550
We have Chidi and Eleanor
and Tahani and Jason

427
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:49,055
and that is it.

428
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:53,097
If we can't get them enough afterlife points
to get them into the Good Place

429
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:56,684
then there's no point in us even being here.
We have to try.

430
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,732
OK. Let's do this.

431
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,030
O-OK.

432
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,734
What the hell is that?

433
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,694
Oh! Hey, guys!

434
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:09,613
What are you doing down here?
