1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,671
- What door?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's going on?

2
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,920
Who are you, and why were you
talking about us?

3
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:08,552
And what's the "good place,"
and what are "afterlife points"

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,341
and who has the most and... is it me?

5
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:13,431
Wait a second, I know this guy!
You're Zack Pizazz!

6
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:15,012
He got me here from Jacksonville.

7
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:18,307
No, this is the librarian,
from the University.

8
00:00:18,401 --> 00:00:21,985
Well, I know him as Gordon Indigo,
a very rude Silicon Valley investor.

9
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,524
Alright, guys.

10
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:26,657
I can explain everything.
Just give me one second, OK?

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:28,985
How do we get out of this?

12
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:31,821
Well, they heard us explaining
the entire system of the afterlife

13
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:35,079
and they saw an interdimensional door
open and close, so...

14
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,084
not a ton of wiggle room here.

15
00:00:37,128 --> 00:00:40,542
But, you're forgetting one crucial piece
of information.

16
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:43,634
Right?

17
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:46,655
I mean, you're forgetting one crucial piece
of information, that'll save us?

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,719
Yo! Buddy! You have like three seconds
to explain this crazy space door

19
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:52,209
or Chidi here is gonna beat you up!

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,176
- Yes!
- Oh, no... I'm... I'm... I'm not

21
00:00:54,312 --> 00:00:56,770
but I would like to know
about the space door.

22
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:01,108
Alright. I don't know what choice we have.
I'll tell you the truth.

23
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,775
My name is Special Agent Rick Justice.

24
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,697
And this is Lisa "Frenchy" Fuqua.

25
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:11,991
We're with the FBI,
and all of you are in grave danger.

26
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,290
I knew it.

27
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:25,541
Agent Fuqua and I are...
paranormal investigators.

28
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,376
We're here to protect you from...

29
00:01:28,513 --> 00:01:32,052
demons. No, wait, that's real... um...
ghouls... ghouls!

30
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:35,555
We're here to protect you from ghouls.
Now I had to appear...

31
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,853
in different disguises to keep tabs on you

32
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,689
but you are all involved together...

33
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:42,232
in this FBI case.

34
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:44,560
No, we can... we can... prove this.

35
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,900
We have detailed files on all of you.

36
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,526
Ask Janet anything.

37
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:50,194
- Who's Janet?
- "Frenchy".

38
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,200
- Frenchy.
- Sorry...

39
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,370
"Frenchy's" nickname is Janet.

40
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:55,935
I thought her nickname was "Frenchy".

41
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:57,374
It is.

42
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,208
That's why they call her...

43
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:02,503
- Lisa "Double Nickname" Fuqua.
- Mm-hm.

44
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,965
OK. Guys, I used to work at a place
that was raided by the FBI pretty frequently.

45
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:11,467
I know a Fed when I see one
and these two "jamokes" are not FBI, OK?

46
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:13,307
Who are you?

47
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,716
- Really.
- Fine, fine, fine.

48
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,219
- Just give me one more second.
- One.

49
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:19,807
- Serious question?
- Yep?

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,681
- Should we kill them?
- What?

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
It might work!

52
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:25,150
We kill them, go back through the door

53
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,728
somehow grab them
before they get to the Bad Place

54
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,193
and regroup from there.
I could kill them right now.

55
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,276
And you know, it would be easy.
Their bodies are very poorly made.

56
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:35,235
They're mostly goo and juice.

57
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,405
You just take the juice out
and then they're dead.

58
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:38,582
Michael...

59
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,703
they've seen through the door
into the afterlife

60
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,250
and they heard how it works.

61
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:44,957
It's over.

62
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:47,839
Ah...

63
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:52,721
Fine.

64
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:55,415
Guess, I'll start at the beginning.

65
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:57,933
You all died.

66
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,312
Well, this sucks.

67
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,569
So, to sum up...

68
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:11,610
there is a heaven and hell

69
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,028
we've been to hell and...

70
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,490
now, no matter how good we are
for the rest of our lives

71
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,492
we're going back to hell.

72
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,374
Again, it's not the classic
Christian "hell", but...

73
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,702
that's the gist, yes.

74
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:27,046
As soon as you learned about the afterlife

75
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:30,966
your motivation to be good was corrupted...

76
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:33,422
so you can't earn points anymore.

77
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,347
So sorry for eternally dooming you.

78
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,174
And that's our bad, guys.

79
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:41,134
So, all the attempts you made to...

80
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:45,602
torture us, we must have been
in the afterlife for a hundred years.

81
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,399
Almost three hundred, actually.

82
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,505
Well, how is it possible that all these
things happened to us

83
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:50,631
but no time passed on Earth?

84
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:52,988
Did you go back in time to save us?

85
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:54,739
Uh, I didn't have to

86
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,818
because of "Jeremy Bearimy".

87
00:03:58,162 --> 00:03:59,653
Who's Jeremy Bearimy?

88
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:03,949
OK, things in the afterlife don't happen

89
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,542
"while" things are happening here

90
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,293
because while time on Earth moves
in a straight line

91
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:13,626
one thing happens, then the next,
then the next...

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,055
Time in the afterlife moves
in a "Jeremy Bearimy."

93
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:19,548
What?

94
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:24,228
The afterlife time doubles back and loops
around and ends up looking something, like...

95
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,976
"Jeremy Bearimy".

96
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:29,729
This is the timeline in the afterlife.

97
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:34,067
Happens to kinda look like the name
"Jeremy Bearimy" in cursive English

98
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,819
so that's what we call it.

99
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,909
Sorry, I'm... my brain is melting.

100
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:45,458
How can events happen before
the ones that happened... before?

101
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,457
Just the way it works. It's...
it's "Jeremy Bearimy."

102
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,923
I don't know what to tell you.
That's the easiest way to describe it.

103
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:54,167
OK, but, um...

104
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:58,136
what the hell is this?
The dot over the "I".

105
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,179
- The hell is that?
- OK, um...

106
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,349
how do I explain this concisely?

107
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,219
This is Tuesdays...

108
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,814
- and also July.
- And sometimes it's never.

109
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,024
That's true.
Occasionally, that moment...

110
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,399
on the "Bearimy" timeline
is the time-moment

111
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,190
when nothing "never" occurs.

112
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:18,909
So...

113
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,786
you get it?

114
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:23,028
This broke me, uh...

115
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,622
The dot over the "I".

116
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,123
That broke me, I'm...

117
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,327
I'm done.

118
00:05:29,504 --> 00:05:31,962
You know what?
I'm glad this whole thing happened

119
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:36,000
because now I can go back to living
my life the way I used to

120
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:39,253
only caring about myself,
because being good is pointless.

121
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:42,181
- No, no. Ah, please, Eleanor, just...
- No, thank you. I'm outtie.

122
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,382
See ya in hell.

123
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,601
You know what I just realised?

124
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,887
I always say that when leaving a room

125
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,222
but right now, it's accurate!

126
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:54,352
I will literally see all of you in hell!

127
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,978
Not if I see you first!

128
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:57,572
Let's go, Jason.

129
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,574
No, no, look, look!
You guys, this is not over!

130
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,198
We have to stay together.
Look, we'll figure something out!

131
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:06,451
Like, just one idea I had,
I could kill all of you!

132
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:10,534
That's my birthday.

133
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:18,042
Hey, buddy, it's my birthday.
One free margarita please!

134
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:19,593
Well, happy birthday!

135
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,090
- Can I just see some ID?
- No.

136
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,177
- Why not?
- Well, because it's not really my birthday,

137
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,428
I just want a free margarita.

138
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:29,261
Well, if I just randomly gave you
a free drink, I'd have to do it for everyone.

139
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:30,541
Pretty soon I'd go out of business.

140
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:32,557
Then don't do it for everyone.

141
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,983
Just do it for me
because it's my birthday!

142
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:36,653
Happy Birthday.

143
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,649
Jason, I have an idea but...

144
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:42,993
It's a little risky.

145
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:44,784
I need you to act as my bodyguard

146
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,739
like my friend, Kevin Costner,
in that movie where he was a bodyguard.

147
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,416
The Bodyguard.

148
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,121
No problem. My cousin once hired me
to do crowd control

149
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,313
for his off-brand Sea World.

150
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:57,081
Well, technically, it was just a bunch
of kiddie pools full of jellyfish.

151
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:59,883
And instead of a killer whale,
they killed a whale.

152
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,512
Excuse me, miss.

153
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:05,931
We'd like to buy one opera, please!

154
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:11,308
Uh... what he means is "I would like to give
two million dollars to the Sydney Opera".

155
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,309
Miss Al-Jamil, this is...

156
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:16,312
so generous.
With a donation of that size

157
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:19,107
we will dedicate our rehearsal hall
in your honour.

158
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:20,278
Thank you, but no.

159
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:24,449
Lovely as it sounds to add to my collection
of wings and atria

160
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:26,071
the gift will be anonymous.

161
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,199
As you wish. I'll draw up the papers.

162
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,203
Why don't you want your name
on the opera house?

163
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:33,704
I love getting my name on stuff!

164
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:36,336
In Jacksonville, I got a flu virus named
after me

165
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,879
cos I kissed a bat on a dare.

166
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:41,042
Well, I was thinking about
why I was sent to hell

167
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:44,674
as one is wont to do when one has recently
been told that one had been sent to hell

168
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:48,094
and it occurred to me,
I have always been held captive

169
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,929
by my desire for attention.

170
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:51,969
Now that I know how it all ends

171
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,688
I just want to be virtuous,
for virtue's sake.

172
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:56,189
That's beautiful.

173
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:58,692
I gotta say, though,
if you want to do more charity

174
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,045
I know a way that could be a lot of fun!

175
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:09,532
Hey. Do you wanna talk to God?

176
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:10,914
"God is dead.

177
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,247
God remains dead.
And we have killed him.

178
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,001
Who will wipe this blood off us?

179
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:22,041
What festivals of atonement,
what sacred games shall we have to invent?"

180
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:24,338
Friedrich Nietzsche, 1882.

181
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,200
I was just trying to sell you some drugs
and you made it weird.

182
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,272
I've never written a manifesto before.

183
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,067
What are you gonna say?
It'll be a complete account

184
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,526
of everything we've learned

185
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:52,245
from the beginning
of my Neighbourhood to right now.

186
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,822
- Mm...
- And then a recommendation

187
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,541
of how we feel
the afterlife could be improved.

188
00:08:57,128 --> 00:08:59,370
When we turn ourselves in,
we'll give it to the Judge

189
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:00,921
and hopefully she'll read it.

190
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,711
We've failed, Janet.

191
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:07,301
But maybe one day someone else will succeed.

192
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,721
OK, so...

193
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:12,392
A...

194
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,305
Ma...

195
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:15,684
ni...

196
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,145
fes...

197
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:18,642
to.

198
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,442
By...

199
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:22,608
Mi...

200
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,110
Where's the "H"?

201
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:26,372
- This keyboard doesn't have an "H".
- Well...

202
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,406
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait...
I see it. I see it.

203
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:33,112
- Oh, no, no, no. Look what I did!
- Yeah.

204
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:35,121
I wrote "Micahel".

205
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,120
Oh, that's...
OK, back, back, back, back, back.

206
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,167
Maybe you should dictate and I should type.

207
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,381
Good call

208
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,335
Just laying out some early details.

209
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:47,212
Go ahead and start dictating.

210
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:51,679
Look, there have to be rules.
Every place has rules.

211
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:53,473
Ugh! Fine, here are my rules...

212
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:57,477
Rule number one, I get to do whatever I want
and you all just have to deal with it.

213
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,184
Rule two, no more Spider-Man movies!

214
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,098
There's way too many Spider-Man movies.

215
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,442
Too many dorky little twerpy Spider-men.

216
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:08,439
Rule three, everyone leave me alone.

217
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,907
So you just take care of yourself

218
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:13,238
you don't owe anything to anyone else?

219
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:15,287
If people lived that way,
society would break down.

220
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,869
Yeah! In America everyone does
whatever they want

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,164
society did break down, it's terrible,
and it's great!

222
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:22,919
You only look out for Number One

223
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:24,917
scream at whoever disagrees with you.

224
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:27,582
There are no bees because they all died

225
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:30,252
and if you need surgery
you just beg for money on the internet.

226
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,507
It's a perfect system!

227
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,759
Now get me another drink.
Tomorrow's my birthday.

228
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:39,349
Well, well, well, a wallet.

229
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:45,358
My rules say I get to take the cash out
and keep it, because in my society

230
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,356
I do whatever I want cos I'm awesome.

231
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,450
Just take it.

232
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,659
Take it, Eleanor. Just...

233
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:56,746
Ugh!

234
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,124
Alright, this is the address on the licence.
That'll be 58 bucks.

235
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,544
Keep the meter running, as soon as I'm done
here I'm gonna head to the airport

236
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,108
get the hell out of this trash country

237
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,795
where everyone is either
a criminal or a spider.

238
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,636
Hello, ma'am.
Is there a Fred Booth here?

239
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:17,887
I found his wallet, and now I'm doing a nice
thing and returning it, because I suck.

240
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,845
Sorry, he moved. I can give you his new
address if you'd like?

241
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,225
Actually, I have some of his mail.

242
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,355
If you're gonna go see him
could you bring it along?

243
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:28,985
Of course, I would love
to bring some "rando" his mail.

244
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:31,025
Anything else you want me to schlep over?

245
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:34,949
Well, this awesome day gets "awesomer."

246
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:39,120
Before the airport, we're heading
to 78 Palmer Street.

247
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,702
Ha! That's right next to the bar
where I picked you up!

248
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,243
I feel like a bloody boomerang!

249
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,044
Of course you do.

250
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,471
- Uh...
- Hello.

251
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:06,932
Sir, you, uh... can't shop here
without a shirt.

252
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:08,318
Oh.

253
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:21,613
Sir, that'll be 880 dollars.

254
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:22,993
Here's my credit card.

255
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,500
Why don't you just charge it,
and keep it forever?

256
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:28,207
And, also, here's the keys to my car.

257
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,027
Wait, do you guys have, like,
a "take a car, leave a car" tray?

258
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:34,126
No? You know, just take it. Just take it.

259
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,172
Excuse me, sir?
Would you like some free money?

260
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:42,054
Now you can buy fingers for your gloves.

261
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,268
Hello, Madam. Are you poor?

262
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:46,604
Here's 5,000 dollars for a new stroller.

263
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:47,730
Have a nice day!

264
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,150
You don't have to say
the "are you poor?" part.

265
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:51,152
Right.

266
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:52,439
Hello! Here's some money.

267
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,652
- Here you go.
- Hello.

268
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,946
Here you go.

269
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:56,739
Now you can buy a bigger chin guitar.

270
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:00,827
This was a truly great plan.

271
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:01,994
Ah, thanks.

272
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:06,036
Man, there are so many times
that just this amount of money

273
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,500
would have changed my life.

274
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:09,585
I could have paid my rent.

275
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,288
I could've gone to a real doctor

276
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:14,170
instead of pretending
I was a big dog so I could go to the vet.

277
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,923
You know, that gives me an idea.

278
00:13:19,056 --> 00:13:20,534
Which I suppose, one could argue means

279
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:22,220
that anything could've given me an idea.

280
00:13:22,893 --> 00:13:23,893
Come with me.

281
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,727
I'm sorry, Miss Al-Jamil

282
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,646
but I just don't feel comfortable

283
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:29,848
processing this request.

284
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:32,733
- Why not?
- Well, it just seems a bit... odd

285
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:35,938
to transfer the totality of your account

286
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:39,820
131 million British pounds
to the account of...

287
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:41,411
this person...

288
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:46,198
a man who is so flagrantly ignoring
the "one lollipop per customer" rule.

289
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,747
No, I walked out and back in each time,
so I'm "different" customers.

290
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:53,122
We're technically supposed to shut down
the bank

291
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:55,423
if anyone from Florida even walks in.

292
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,090
Look, all my life this money has been
a weight around my neck.

293
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:02,347
Like the Heart of the Ocean necklace
my friend James Cameron once gave me.

294
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:04,883
I don't want the money.
My friend Jason does.

295
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,684
I would like to give it to him.

296
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,433
If it's easier, you can just put it
on a Game Stop gift card.

297
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:11,894
That does not make it "easier."

298
00:14:12,276 --> 00:14:13,858
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

299
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:19,073
- G'day.
- Fred?

300
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:21,491
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
I have all your crap.

301
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,119
- Thank you!
- And your wallet.

302
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:26,700
Oh, my goodness!

303
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,829
- Thank you so much!
- It was nothing.

304
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,041
Dude, I didn't take your money.
I would never even think of doing that.

305
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,838
No, no, no, I'm not worried about that.

306
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:37,920
Ah, here it is.

307
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,590
I started a new job
a few months ago and...

308
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,262
I got really nervous.

309
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,763
So my daughter Carolyn drew this for me,
to make me feel better.

310
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:48,226
Ah, it's my good luck charm.

311
00:14:48,729 --> 00:14:51,346
Every time I'm stressed at work now,
I just have to look at this

312
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:53,143
and I feel...

313
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,192
you know... safe.

314
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:57,611
Look, a lot of people wouldn't
have tried so hard to get this to me.

315
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,896
You are a good person, Eleanor.

316
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:03,191
I really hope my daughter turns out
like you when she grows up.

317
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,492
- Are you alright?
- No, you shut up!

318
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,990
Sorry. It's been a weird day.

319
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:15,829
♪ You put the Peeps in the chilipot,
and eat them both up ♪

320
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:19,382
♪ You put the Peeps in the chilipot,
and add the M&Ms ♪

321
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,012
You put the Peeps in the chili pot,
It makes it taste... bad!

322
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,593
I'm gonna eat all this chili

323
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:30,097
and/or die trying.

324
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,598
Anyone want any?

325
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,521
I'm just gonna put it right down here.

326
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:36,016
Come on. Dip your balls in my chili.

327
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,610
Scoop your little mittens right in the stew.

328
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:39,903
Professor?

329
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:42,981
I can see that you're going through
something, but exams are next week.

330
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,987
So can you teach us anything?

331
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:47,068
Alright, nerd.

332
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,533
You want to learn something?
I'll teach you something.

333
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,739
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of life.

334
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:53,374
How do ya like them apples?

335
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:57,462
Now over the last, 25 hundred years

336
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:02,425
Western philosophers have formed three
main theories on how to live an ethical life.

337
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,087
Now first off, there's "virtue ethics."

338
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,928
Aristotle believed that there were
certain virtues

339
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,100
of mind and character, like courage...

340
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:15,598
or generosity, and you should try to develop
yourself in accordance with those virtues.

341
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,648
The gift will be anonymous.

342
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,060
Next, there's consequentialism.

343
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,030
The basis for judgment about whether
something is right or wrong

344
00:16:24,074 --> 00:16:27,238
stems from the consequences of that action.

345
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:30,328
How much utility, or good, did it accomplish

346
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:32,326
versus how much pain, or bad.

347
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,578
And finally, there's deontology -

348
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:39,838
the school of thought that there are strict
rules and duties that everyone must adhere to

349
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,206
in a functioning society.

350
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,793
Being ethical is simply identifying
and obeying those duties

351
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:46,753
and following those rules.

352
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,690
But here's the thing, my little chili babies

353
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:51,679
all three of those theories are hot,
stinky, cat "dookie".

354
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,227
The true meaning of life

355
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:58,523
the actual ethical system
that you should all follow

356
00:16:58,776 --> 00:16:59,812
is nihilism.

357
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,278
The world is empty.

358
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:06,531
There is no point to anything

359
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,157
and you're just gonna die.

360
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:10,410
So do whatever!

361
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:15,032
And now, I'm gonna eat my marshmallow
candy chili in silence

362
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:19,415
and you all can jump up your own butts.

363
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:22,463
- Is that going to be on the test?
- Yes.

364
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,050
And no.

365
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:26,255
And you all get "A's or "F's.

366
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:27,756
And there is no test.

367
00:17:27,888 --> 00:17:29,754
And you all failed it,
and you all got "A's.

368
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:31,098
Who cares?

369
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:32,594
Goodbye.

370
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:36,807
Good-byeeeeeeee.

371
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,693
Cool lecture.

372
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,651
And cooler shirt.

373
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,531
Feeling alright?

374
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
I feel fine.

375
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,778
- Mm...
- I do have a stomach ache.

376
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,777
Why do I always have a stomach ache?

377
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:55,530
Well, you just ate 50 pounds of chilli, bro,
this one's on you.

378
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:58,662
Look, I know the future seems bleak

379
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:00,243
but I have a plan.

380
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:01,712
Come with me.

381
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:05,840
Nah-ah-ah! Leave that chilli, weirdo.

382
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:12,764
A complete account of every single thing
we've done and learned.

383
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:17,178
I added all the data we've gathered
here on Earth, in chart and graph form.

384
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:21,811
And I added a pretty tasty little recipe
for cinnamon rolls made out of pizza dough.

385
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,940
Ha!

386
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,312
Maybe someone, someday,
can learn from our mistakes

387
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,483
and enact real change in the process
of judging people.

388
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:35,411
But, for now Janet, old friend

389
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,034
we are going to enjoy our time on Earth

390
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,741
before we're retired.

391
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,371
- Hm.
- So, let's get started.

392
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:42,956
I know it's touristy

393
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,880
but I'd really like to visit
a lens crafters.

394
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,798
Ooh, and I'd like to get bangs.

395
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:49,926
Hey, guys!

396
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:52,762
It... it's really nice to see you, um...

397
00:18:53,223 --> 00:18:54,555
is everything OK?

398
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,683
Other than, you know... everything?

399
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,477
We've started to accept our fates.

400
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:01,554
It's all chilli under the bridge.

401
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,390
Oh, good. You're all here.

402
00:19:04,568 --> 00:19:05,604
Big news everyone!

403
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,402
- We got married!
- We got tacos!

404
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:11,857
Oh, oh yeah. We got married
and then after we got married

405
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,068
- we got tacos!
- Wow!

406
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:17,987
Wow, that's crazy!

407
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,868
Well, it's strictly platonic, of course.

408
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,581
We only did it so I could legally give Jason
half my money.

409
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,378
We just popped over to the British Embassy
and signed the papers.

410
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,798
That's insane, but it's also, like...

411
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,089
the eleventh most insane thing
to happen today, so...

412
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:34,429
who cares?
I need everyone to focus up.

413
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:36,430
So, the four of us...

414
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:40,643
the six of us, really, are doomed.

415
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:42,770
Our fates are sealed.

416
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,681
But I think we have one move left.

417
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,767
We can try.

418
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,727
Try what?

419
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:50,815
Try to do good.

420
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:54,616
That stupid little voice in my head
told me to do something good today

421
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:55,782
and it was so annoying

422
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:00,409
but it also made a dork and his very
untalented daughter super happy.

423
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,077
Me trying, just a little bit,
put some good out into the world.

424
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:08,500
The six of us are not getting in
to the Good Place.

425
00:20:08,882 --> 00:20:11,966
But there are still people in this world
that we care about

426
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,970
so I say we try and help them
be good people.

427
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:17,342
Try and help them get in.

428
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:18,802
I mean, why not try?

429
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:20,724
It's better than not trying, right?

430
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,677
That's a lovely sentiment, Eleanor.

431
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:24,808
Let's try.

432
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:26,518
- I'm in.
- I'm in too.

433
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:29,858
I'm gonna remember this day forever
because of your dope speech.

434
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:31,978
And also because of the great tacos I had

435
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,880
and also because I got married
and I found out I was going to hell

436
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,512
- and also I became a hundred millionaire.
- Alright, we get it. We get it.

437
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,198
It goes without saying
that we're in.

438
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:41,029
Let's say it anyway.

439
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:43,077
- We're I... Alright, you go.
- We're...

440
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:46,159
- We're I...
- We're in! We're just so excited.

441
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
We're in!

442
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:50,334
What do you say, bud?
You want to join the soul squad?

443
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:51,756
Try to save some souls?

444
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah, I'm in.

445
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,884
But first, I have to go
to the bathroom forever.

446
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:00,010
There you are, my love!

447
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,434
I was just on my way to the MRI lab,
thought I heard your voice.

448
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:06,937
Ready to go to the airport?
Start our lives together?

449
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:11,067
Go ahead Tahani, we're rolling.
