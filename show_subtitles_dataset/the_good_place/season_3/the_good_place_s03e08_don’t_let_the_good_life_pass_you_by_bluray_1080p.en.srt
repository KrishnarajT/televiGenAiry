1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,371
This library's depressing.

2
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:30,751
All they have in the Poetry section
is Jeff Foxworthy books.

3
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:34,179
Well, we needed someplace deserted,
and there's no place more deserted

4
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:37,682
than a public library in Arizona.
Now let's go, man!

5
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:40,038
We only have a few hours
before we have to pick the gang up

6
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:42,475
from the airport -
fire up Janet's memory gizmo.

7
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:46,021
Flooding your brain with memories
from the afterlife is dangerous.

8
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:49,061
In one of the reboots,
you and Chidi were in love.

9
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:52,023
- Can't you just take my word for that?
- No, dude, I can't.

10
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:54,824
My screwed-up relationship
with my parents made me believe

11
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,869
I could never really love anyone.
I need to see it for myself.

12
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,788
Those are my memories.
I want them back.

13
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,707
OK. Fine. Have a seat.

14
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:06,002
Luckily, before we shut
the Neighbourhood down

15
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:09,882
Janet saved a complete record
of all the reboots.

16
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:11,045
Put those in your ears.

17
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:17,468
- What's all that for?
- You'll see.

18
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:20,096
We're gonna start with a simple,
three-second memory.

19
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,161
Why only three secon...?

20
00:01:22,855 --> 00:01:25,097
- Oh, hi, Eleanor!
- Buongiorno, Eleanor!

21
00:01:25,316 --> 00:01:27,057
Morning, Bambadjan! Morning, Vicky!

22
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,227
Ugh. Those two are such forking dweebs.

23
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,771
As I told you...

24
00:01:32,948 --> 00:01:37,409
Recalling afterlife memories here on Earth
has some... significant side-effects.

25
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:40,947
You should be back to normal
in about 20 minutes.

26
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:55,426
Ah, looking a little better.
The banana must have helped.

27
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:58,176
Before we go any further,
I have one very important question...

28
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,177
Did I look hot bald?

29
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,304
Cos I always kinda
felt like I could pull it off.

30
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:06,058
I have no real ability to gauge
physical attractiveness in humans.

31
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,190
But no, you did not "pull it off."

32
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:13,730
OK, that short clip should have
rewired your brain, like an inoculation.

33
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:17,567
So, now I can show you the highlights
of reboot 119.

34
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:20,152
I'm skipping all of the sleeping
and chewing.

35
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:21,911
You guys are always either sleeping

36
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:23,863
or chewing something.

37
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:30,587
So... we are moving on to the subject
of free will versus determinism.

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,547
We are officially done with Nietzsche.

39
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,799
Aw. I'm gonna miss Nietzsche.

40
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,965
I spent a lot of my life thinking
I was better than everyone else

41
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:40,259
and he showed me why I was right.

42
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:42,761
Gimme that reading list.
What have we got...?

43
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:45,765
Oh, a little Aristotle, a little Descartes

44
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:49,436
a little Tommy Quine-Quine.
That's what I call Saint Thomas Aquinas.

45
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,108
Three months of philosophy class,
and you're already...

46
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,449
Hm...

47
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,702
What are you grinning at, weirdo?

48
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,561
Come on, we're gonna be late
for the Neighbourhood meeting.

49
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:09,292
I gotta say

50
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,662
it seems like I was really
nailing that philosophy class.

51
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:13,733
Can you believe my high school voted me

52
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,791
"Most Likely to Die Young and
Unaccomplished"?

53
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,343
You did die young and unaccomplished.

54
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:20,420
- Fair enough.
- Put those back in.

55
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:24,512
Ah! My favourite four residents!

56
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,347
Don't tell the others.

57
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,429
Welcome to "Pick a Pet Day".

58
00:03:29,565 --> 00:03:32,979
We have hundreds of beautiful animals
for you to choose from.

59
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:38,773
And when you do make your choice,
your pet will bond to your soul forever.

60
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:41,817
Fabulous! I haven't had a pet
since Barbara Streisand gave me

61
00:03:41,869 --> 00:03:43,451
one of her cloned Siamese cats

62
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:45,494
- and it killed itself.
- Ah.

63
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:48,560
I'm going to look at the mythical pets,
darling. Catch up when you're ready.

64
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:49,584
- May I?
- Yes.

65
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:53,874
Dude, we can get mythical animals?
Maybe I'll get a penguin!

66
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:55,251
Penguins are real.

67
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,423
That's the spirit, Eleanor!

68
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:59,171
They're real to me too.

69
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:07,597
Ooh! This one looks just like
the one I had when I was a little kid.

70
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:09,602
He's so cute!

71
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,398
But is... is... is this one a little...
a little cuter?

72
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:17,360
I mean, this pup looks friskier, but...

73
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:20,234
this one looks a little sweeter? Maybe?

74
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,783
Uh-oh. It's Chidi kryptonite,
the choice between any two things.

75
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:25,530
Settle in, lizard.

76
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:26,828
This is gonna be a while.

77
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,532
Michael? What's a "Mirror Centaur?"

78
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,993
Ah, a stunning creature

79
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:36,504
whose human half
takes on the image of its companion.

80
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:42,632
Greetings. I am T'Hania, Goddess of Beauty.

81
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:45,342
Oh, my!

82
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,033
I mean, should I take
the cutest puppy, or is that shallow?

83
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:53,521
And is it even OK to separate them?
Are they brother and sister, or...

84
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:55,148
or perhaps married?

85
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:56,566
Dude, they're heaven-puppies.

86
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:59,144
I'm sure they're both incredible.
Just choose one.

87
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:01,279
You're right. The black one!

88
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,855
That was my first impulse,
and that is the one I'll take!

89
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:06,989
I'm so sorry, Chidi...
both puppies have been taken.

90
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:08,828
Yeah, I should've seen that coming.

91
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:12,039
My indecision has once again
cost me happiness

92
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,163
and I will now suffer the consequences.

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,280
How many pets have gone unclaimed?

94
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:19,881
Three. A 16-foot albino python...
â€” Mm-mm!

95
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,010
Something called a "tarantula-squid,"
and this owl!

96
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:26,171
The tarantula-squid! Tarantula-squid!

97
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:28,131
Tarantula-squid! Tarantula-squid!

98
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:29,261
I'll take the owl.

99
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:32,727
Check it out!
Janet made him a little cowboy hat!

100
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:34,020
Isn't that stupid?

101
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:36,894
Chidi? Hello?

102
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:39,226
Shh! Spencer doesn't like loud voices!

103
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:41,861
Yeesh, what happened, man?

104
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:46,362
Well, I was trying to teach him to play
"fetch," like I did with my puppy as a kid.

105
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:50,488
But instead of retrieving the stick,
he attacked my face

106
00:05:50,706 --> 00:05:52,197
with his razor-sharp talons.

107
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,825
Why don't you just ask Michael for a dog?

108
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:57,707
Because it was my mistake
to not pick a puppy fast enough.

109
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:00,626
I made my bed, and now I'll... bleed in it.

110
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:02,833
Let me do that, dummy. Come here.

111
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,628
What if I talk to Michael for you?

112
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:09,928
That way you don't have to worry about
feeling ungrateful, or whatever

113
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:13,306
and maybe you'll still get a puppy,
instead of...

114
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:14,395
Ow!

115
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:15,645
Deep wounds.

116
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:18,439
- You'd do that?
- Of course! It's the least I can do

117
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:20,482
considering everything you've done for me.

118
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:25,230
So you get it, right?

119
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:26,324
- Hey!
- What?

120
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:27,899
You liked him, he liked you

121
00:06:27,993 --> 00:06:29,529
you did nice things for each other.

122
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,363
Your lack of parental affection
did not make you numb

123
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:33,992
to love, blah, blah, blah.

124
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,369
"Blah, blah, blah?"

125
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:38,167
Why don't you want me to see this?
What are you hiding?

126
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:41,671
Nothing.
It's just the rest is not interesting.

127
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:43,957
Yeah, no, you're right,
"not that interesting."

128
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:47,044
Just watching myself fall in love
for the first time in fake heaven.

129
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:48,137
What else is on?

130
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:52,557
I am going to put this back in my ear,
and you are going to show me

131
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:55,977
how thoughtful and caring I am,
or I'm gonna rip off your demon head

132
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:59,477
and shove it up whatever's where
your butt should be. Roll it!

133
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,858
Oh...
a lizard was a perfect choice, Eleanor.

134
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,772
You both have combination skin!

135
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:12,202
Thanks. Hey, this is a weird question
to ask, I'll just throw it out there

136
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,494
can I ride your centaur?

137
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,790
I'm afraid T'Hania's quite particular
about whom she allows to ride her.

138
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,286
I tried, and she gave me a withering stare.

139
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,249
Turns out centaurs are a bit tricky.

140
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:26,383
You didn't have, like,
a stable full of horses growing up?

141
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:28,597
Oh, of course, but they just pulled
our carriages

142
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:31,095
or performed in our horse ballets.
They weren't so...

143
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:32,798
what's the word?

144
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:34,308
Judgmental.

145
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:36,643
With whom can I speak
about acquiring new shoes?

146
00:07:36,854 --> 00:07:38,832
You can't expect me to walk around
in these flats all day

147
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:41,189
like some common glue-factory hobo horse.

148
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:42,686
Eleanor? You were looking for me?

149
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:44,108
Uh, yeah! So...

150
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:47,195
Chidi chose an owl,
because he froze up trying to decide

151
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:49,864
between two puppies.
Is it possible for him to swap?

152
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:51,941
Of course! This is the Good Place!

153
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,657
But he might want to hold off.

154
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,323
Tonight we're having a party,
where everyone gets to transform

155
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,625
into their pets for a few minutes,
as a treat!

156
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,378
Chidi can fly like an owl, and you can...

157
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:05,080
do whatever lizards do!

158
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:08,921
Tahani, would you host the party
at your mansion?

159
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:11,090
Of course! I'd love to.

160
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,755
Is that what you're going to wear?

161
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:16,011
What? N-no, no...

162
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,763
Of course not!

163
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:20,433
Why? Is it unflattering?

164
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:22,063
I... I can change!

165
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:25,232
Guys, I can't find my lizard.

166
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,397
He was just out there, like, one second ago.

167
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:29,320
No big deal. Janet can find it.

168
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:30,859
No, I can't risk it.

169
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:34,113
These pets are supposed to, like,
bond to our souls forever.

170
00:08:34,203 --> 00:08:36,536
If Michael finds out mine ran away,
he could figure out

171
00:08:36,622 --> 00:08:37,954
I'm not the real Eleanor.

172
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,039
Just, um... go without me.

173
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,667
And tell people that I'm hanging out
with my lizard

174
00:08:42,753 --> 00:08:47,168
because we are so meshed together
or whatever, circle of life, crap like that.

175
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:48,835
- You sure?
- Yeah.

176
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:51,338
Go enjoy flying. I'll meet you there.

177
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,470
Come on, Blake!

178
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,926
Lizard? Lizard!

179
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,600
Where the fork are you? Lizard!

180
00:09:00,646 --> 00:09:02,228
Ugh! Why didn't I name you?

181
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,102
Hey.

182
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:06,353
- Why?
- Oh!

183
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,192
Oh, no... Chidi!

184
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,897
Sorry I shoved you, man.
Just been a little jumpy.

185
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:15,178
Hey, you didn't happen to see
my lizard in the lake

186
00:09:15,202 --> 00:09:16,638
when you were thrashing around down there?

187
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:19,655
No. It was cold and dark and scary.

188
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,118
But, don't worry.

189
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,657
We'll find him.

190
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:25,869
Michael and Janet are busy
transforming people anyway

191
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,763
so they didn't even notice
you weren't there.

192
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:30,089
Holy crap, you're supposed
to be flying right now!

193
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:32,592
It's no big deal.
I just decided I'd rather be...

194
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:34,554
helping you.

195
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:37,305
Than soaring through the air like an owl?

196
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,348
That's amazing.

197
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:42,135
You're amazing.

198
00:09:45,566 --> 00:09:48,104
After that,
you spent all your time together.

199
00:09:48,402 --> 00:09:50,268
You studied philosophy together.

200
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,820
You even got Chidi hooked
on popcorn shrimp.

201
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:56,487
Eventually, you became suspicious of me
and escaped

202
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:58,739
to Mindy Saint Claire's house
on a train.

203
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:01,871
That was the first time you actually
said it out loud.

204
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,702
I love you.

205
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:06,288
And you don't need to respond, cos...

206
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:09,712
- I know you have trouble saying how you feel.
- I love you, too.

207
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:15,344
That's the story.

208
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,214
You're capable of human love.
Congrats! Can we go now?

209
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:20,552
How did it end?

210
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,305
Like it always did, with me rebooting you.

211
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,807
- There's... there's no need to...
- Show me, please.

212
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:29,586
Alright, let's get this over with.

213
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,444
- So, listen, guys...
- No! You... listen!

214
00:10:32,738 --> 00:10:37,324
We just went to Mindy Saint Claire's,
and when she wasn't trying to trick us

215
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:40,722
into having a threesome, she filled us in on
everything that you've been up to here.

216
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:41,746
Oh, yeah?

217
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,225
We know this is like the hundredth time
you've tried to torture us

218
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:45,581
but this time it's different

219
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,040
because...

220
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:48,753
we're in love.

221
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:52,121
And love is stronger than anything
you can throw at us.

222
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,799
No, it's not.

223
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:56,175
"Love is stronger than anything
I can throw at you?"

224
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,253
I could throw an elephant at you.

225
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:01,180
You think a thrown elephant wouldn't
crush you because of love?

226
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,182
She was speaking metaphorically.

227
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:04,975
Even metaphorically, it's lame.

228
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,228
It's OK.

229
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:09,267
No matter what he does,
we will find each other

230
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,859
and we will help each other,
because we're soulmates.

231
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:18,903
There's no such thing
as "soulmates", you dingus!

232
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,401
I made it up!

233
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:24,154
I put clowns in your house
because you hate them.

234
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:26,030
I forced you to choose the lizard

235
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,658
and then I made that lizard run away!

236
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,701
I made it all up!

237
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:33,254
Don't you understand that? Ugh.

238
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,500
That's why I didn't want to give you
your memories back.

239
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:40,091
I didn't want you to see how cruel
I used to be.

240
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:43,381
Plus, I wore a lot of French cuff shirts
back then

241
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:46,684
I thought it made me look classy.
But it's... it's... it's all embarrassing.

242
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:48,765
I'm different now, I promise.

243
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:51,309
I'll swear on a Bible like you humans do.

244
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:52,845
I could grab one right now, it...

245
00:11:52,943 --> 00:11:55,026
it's the only book they have
in the Sex-Ed section.

246
00:11:55,112 --> 00:11:56,523
- I'm not mad at you.
- I-I...

247
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,988
Can't be mad at a demon for being evil.

248
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:05,741
I'm just sad because I thought
for a second, I could love someone.

249
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:10,541
But really, it was just you manipulating me
into thinking I loved someone.

250
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:14,791
So I guess I was right.
I'm incapable of love.

251
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:19,835
Eh. That's no biggie.
Do you wanna get burgers?

252
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:26,174
Hang on now, how did you draw
that conclusion?

253
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:29,052
You just watched yourself fall in love
with Chidi.

254
00:12:29,604 --> 00:12:34,190
No, I didn't. I watched a puppeteer pull
a bunch of strings to make us think

255
00:12:34,276 --> 00:12:35,437
we were in love.

256
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,522
You said it yourself - you made it all up.

257
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,238
OK, yes, I put you and Chidi
in close proximity

258
00:12:41,324 --> 00:12:43,611
because I needed you to drive
each other crazy.

259
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:46,660
But I never intended for you
to fall in love.

260
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,447
Once you made us bond,
the romance was inevitable.

261
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:53,748
It's a basic reality show playbook:
put a bunch of attractive young people

262
00:12:53,837 --> 00:12:55,954
in stressful situations,
so they act like idiots

263
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:57,207
and have sex with each other.

264
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,666
This is all just... determinism.

265
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:01,552
What?

266
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:05,714
"Determinism is the theory that we have
no control over our own actions.

267
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:08,512
Everything we do happens
because of some external force

268
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:10,726
which exists outside of our control."

269
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:15,023
I didn't choose to fall in love with Chidi,
because some all-knowing demon, you

270
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:17,725
- brought us together and scripted our lives.
- That's ridiculous.

271
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:20,236
I didn't make you kiss Chidi
by that lake.

272
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:21,447
You kinda did.

273
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:23,865
You orchestrated
the whole "Pet Day" thing

274
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,533
manipulated us
into choosing specific animals

275
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:29,654
made my lizard run away, which led
to Chidi coming to help me find it

276
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:32,448
which led to us kissing,
which led to us "falling in love."

277
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:34,037
None of that was my choice.

278
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:39,047
Everything in my life has been determined
by my upbringing, my genetics

279
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:42,842
or my environment, and everything
in my afterlife was determined by you.

280
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:45,215
There is no such thing as free will.

281
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:47,366
We're closing up soon, guys.

282
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,369
Yeah, can we just have 15 minutes?
We're kind of in the middle of something.

283
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:51,634
I'd take off if I were you.

284
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,183
The second we close,
they use this place to shoot pornos.

285
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:56,982
OK.

286
00:13:58,026 --> 00:14:00,706
- You want something to drink?
- Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

287
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:04,739
But whatever I choose will be the result
of millions of biological

288
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:07,863
genetic and societal factors
that are entirely outside my control.

289
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:11,121
Iced tea?

290
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,014
Oh, that sounds good. I'll have one too.

291
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,742
OK. You think you have no free will

292
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:19,876
because I scripted everything
that happened, right?

293
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:25,802
All I have to do is prove that you made
one choice that I couldn't anticipate.

294
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:27,930
Easy.

295
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,558
OK! Here's a perfect example!

296
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,556
In the very first attempt...

297
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:35,688
- Y...
- Dude, dude, dude!

298
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:37,350
- What?
- Yelling. You're...

299
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,808
- You're yelling, like, so loudly.
- Oh, sorry.

300
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:42,444
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

301
00:14:43,446 --> 00:14:45,938
Watch this. It's from the very first attempt.

302
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,657
If anyone...

303
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,401
has any information...

304
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,236
- Oh, boy.
- About any of this...

305
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,537
OK, easy...

306
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:55,489
I beg you. Tell me.

307
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,666
Hey... I love you, man.

308
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:00,671
Michael?

309
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:03,171
The problem in the Neighbourhood...

310
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,212
is me.

311
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:10,801
You saw your friend in pain,
and you decided to sacrifice yourself

312
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:12,016
to help him.

313
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:15,222
That wasn't me pulling a string,
or manipulating you.

314
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:17,894
In fact, it was the last thing I wanted.

315
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:19,893
Ruined my whole plan.

316
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:22,687
- Free will.
- No, dude.

317
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:26,817
The only reason I cared enough
about Chidi to do that

318
00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:29,149
was because you forced us together

319
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,867
made me feel bad for causing him pain...

320
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,076
- OK, yeah.
- Yeah.

321
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:36,747
But no, you were constantly doing stuff
I couldn't anticipate.

322
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,913
As a matter of fact,
I complained to you once, right...

323
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:43,792
right to your face.
I think it was reboot 444.

324
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,082
Now, is Chidi trapped

325
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:47,545
in the purple space bubble?

326
00:15:47,886 --> 00:15:50,253
Yes. Is he in pain? Almost certainly.

327
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:51,804
Will he ever get out? No.

328
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,757
- However...
- Uh...

329
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,183
Yeah, uh, wrong one, wrong one,
I mean, that's...

330
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:58,594
worth watching - it's great, but, uh...

331
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,333
not-not the one I was thinking.

332
00:16:00,357 --> 00:16:02,314
It's probably, uh... 445.

333
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:09,405
You. In here.

334
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,360
Where am I?

335
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:15,913
Hell.

336
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,456
You're in hell. Can I ask you something?

337
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:22,251
Have I missed anything in that freaky
little noodle of yours?

338
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:24,879
See, I... I've studied everything
about your life.

339
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,004
I know your hopes, your fears,
your psychology, your tendencies.

340
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:34,301
I know all your private shames, like that
you don't wash your feet in the shower.

341
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,716
Your first concert was Barenaked Ladies

342
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:42,473
and you have frequent sex dreams
about Sam the Eagle, from the Muppets.

343
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:45,354
Well, he's very authoritative
and I find that reassuring.

344
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:49,438
You keep making crazy choices
I don't understand.

345
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:52,607
Am I missing something?

346
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,483
I'm sorry, can we rewind for a second?

347
00:16:54,577 --> 00:16:56,364
Who are you? Who is that guy?

348
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,830
Am I dead?

349
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,414
Is Sam the Eagle here?

350
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:01,792
No.

351
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,790
I tried to script your whole afterlife.

352
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:09,461
And I devised a 15 million-point plan
to torture you.

353
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:12,794
You made choices I never saw coming.

354
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:16,088
I call that free will.

355
00:17:19,227 --> 00:17:21,469
What if all your choices are predetermined?

356
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:24,138
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
- What? We don't know!

357
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:27,521
Maybe there's a mega-demon
who built a torture chamber for demons

358
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,567
and this whole thing
is just him torturing you?

359
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,116
And maybe... all the mega-demons
are just fulfilling a destiny laid out

360
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:38,569
by a bunch of super-intelligent
tarantula-squids

361
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:40,199
who are torturing them...

362
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:47,665
Why did you do that?

363
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:50,005
Because I have free will.

364
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:53,175
And because you're being so... annoying.

365
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:57,088
Thank you. So sorry that he did that.

366
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,052
Happens all the time.

367
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:01,885
Usually it's the younger woman doing
it to the older guy, though.

368
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,145
Dude! Not cool.

369
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:06,648
Disagree.

370
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:08,533
I think it's the coolest thing
I've ever done.

371
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,769
Do you really not see what's happening here?

372
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:13,900
Do you want me to spell it out for you?

373
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:17,283
This is a defence mechanism, Eleanor.

374
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:21,161
You saw yourself fall in love with Chidi,
and it freaked you out

375
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:25,241
to see yourself be so vulnerable,
so you're using determinism

376
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:28,294
to convince yourself
that those feelings were not real.

377
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:32,085
- You know, you don't know me, man!
- Yes, I do. I know everything about you.

378
00:18:32,675 --> 00:18:33,711
Remember?

379
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:37,428
Including that nothing scares you
more than vulnerability.

380
00:18:37,555 --> 00:18:39,262
Ugh! Whatever. Who even cares?

381
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:43,389
I do. Because if everything is determined,
and we have no free will

382
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:47,771
then all this stuff we're doing
to put more good into the world is pointless

383
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:50,603
and I want to believe that it matters.

384
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:54,945
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna use my free will right now

385
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:57,239
to go pick up our friends at the airport.

386
00:18:57,742 --> 00:19:01,406
Worst possible use of free will,
but I'm gonna do it anyway

387
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,366
because I care about them.

388
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:09,084
You might wanna head out too.

389
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,913
We're closing soon, and the second we do,
they use this place to shoot porn.

390
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,759
First class was amazing!

391
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:24,809
They give you so many free presents.
A shaving kit, an eye mask... Oh, a vest!

392
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:30,685
Times like this, it's fun to remember
that we're legally married.

393
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,271
That is fun!

394
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:34,897
Oh, I call window seat!

395
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:44,528
I'm sorry. You were right.

396
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:49,242
I was scared about what it all meant,
and I went back to one of my favourite moves

397
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:51,459
turn on the ol' Blame Hose.

398
00:19:51,754 --> 00:19:54,087
"This is all your fault!"

399
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,421
Apology accepted.

400
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:58,380
And I'm sorry I dumped iced tea
on your head.

401
00:19:58,636 --> 00:19:59,636
Are you kidding me?

402
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:02,283
You did exactly what you should do
when your friend is being annoying.

403
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:03,468
You snapped me out of it.

404
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:05,804
That's what made me realise, in a weird way

405
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:09,303
we're the only truly free beings
in the universe

406
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,847
because we actually know
what's up with the afterlife.

407
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,562
And I think that means we need
to be bold.

408
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,277
Take the Soul Squad
to the next level somehow.

409
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,656
You're right.

410
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,613
We need to find someone
who can serve as a...

411
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:25,785
as a blueprint for humanity.

412
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:29,206
Someone whose life is so great,
that we can use it as a model

413
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:32,125
to get as many points
for as many people as possible

414
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,794
and I think I know the perfect person.

415
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:35,003
Rihanna! Good call.

416
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:37,193
I don't know her personally,
but I did see her in Vegas once

417
00:20:37,217 --> 00:20:39,254
and her calf brushed up against my tongue.

418
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:42,089
I licked her leg. I was kicked out.

419
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,797
It's not Rihanna, it's someone way cooler.

420
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,716
Hey, everybody out of the car!

421
00:20:47,685 --> 00:20:48,766
Grab your bags!

422
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,602
We're going to rural Canada!

423
00:20:56,236 --> 00:20:59,195
- Is it ready?
- I guess. We have no idea if it'll work.

424
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,526
Oh, I'm sure it's perfect.

425
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,237
- Give it a try, Shawn!
- Me?

426
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:07,077
I'm not going through that thing.
She is.

427
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:10,198
ask Michael how many times
he rebooted them!

428
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,498
He's lying...

429
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,701
Yeah, zip it, toots. We're way past that.

430
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:16,495
Where am I? How long was I in there?

431
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:18,627
You have missed a lot.

432
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,463
Now, go through that makeshift portal,
see if you explode.

433
00:21:24,264 --> 00:21:26,130
This might be gross!

434
00:21:31,646 --> 00:21:33,353
Am I... on Earth?

435
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:37,232
Did you figure out a way to build
an illegal door to Earth?

436
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,319
Yes.

437
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:41,607
That's exactly what I did.

438
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:44,490
- Well, we all helped.
- Shut up, Glenn.
