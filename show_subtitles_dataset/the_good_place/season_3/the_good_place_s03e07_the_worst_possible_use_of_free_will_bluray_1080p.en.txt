1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:03,352
when she bent down to adjust her toe ring
at a Rascal Flatts concert.

2
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:05,600
That police officer was an actor.

3
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:08,934
See, about a month before,
your mum had gotten drunk

4
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:12,942
wandered into a charity auction,
and bid $30,000

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,481
for a date with Gene Simmons

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,819
outbidding everyone else
by $29,800 dollars.

7
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:22,405
She didn't want to pay,
so she faked her death

8
00:00:22,499 --> 00:00:25,788
moved to Nevada, and reinvented herself
as Diana Tremaine.

9
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:29,246
Diana Tremaine is my fake ID name!

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,128
How dare she steal the identity I stole!

11
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:35,506
Look, I know this is a lot to take in,
but we're here to help your mum

12
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:37,511
get into the Good Place.

13
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:41,095
Whatever you're feeling, remember,
this is not about you.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,142
Right.

15
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:45,519
How could you do this to me?

16
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:54,775
Yay! You found me!

17
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:56,239
What the hell, Mum?

18
00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:00,820
OK, baby, I can explain everything.
Let's all just take a breath.

19
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:05,866
You haven't even introduced me
to this stretched-out, sexy Alex Trebek.

20
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,913
I'm Michael. It's nice to meet you, Donna.

21
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,837
Oh, uh, it's Diana now, for...

22
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:12,713
You know, police reasons.

23
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:15,967
- By the way, whose McMansion is this?
- My boyfriend Dave's.

24
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:18,552
He's kind of a dork, but real sweet.

25
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:24,305
And so fancy - his napkins are made out of,
like, shirt material.

26
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:25,394
Cloth.

27
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:29,185
OK. Now this is making sense.

28
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:33,773
You change your name, bag a rich loser
with a tacky house. I get it.

29
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,857
- You're running a scam.
- No, baby.

30
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:39,525
This is as real as the nails
under my acrylic nails.

31
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:41,905
- I'm a different person!
- Spare me.

32
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,822
You will always be sun-baked Arizona trash

33
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:48,158
and I know that because I grew up
baking right beside you!

34
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:50,459
Oh, jeez! I didn't know we had company!

35
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:51,752
Hey. Hi, I'm Dave.

36
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,191
- Michael.
- Of course you're Dave.

37
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:56,799
Hey, Dave. You and I need to have
a little conversation.

38
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:58,592
- Diana!
- Oh, hey!

39
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:00,132
Who the hell is this chick?

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,900
Oh, this is my little potato pie, Patricia!

41
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,181
And who might you be, by the way?

42
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:06,885
Eleanor is my sorority sister.

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,683
Right. Good ol' Kappa Zeta...

44
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:11,023
Jones.

45
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:12,349
- Oh.
- Hey...

46
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:16,019
I can't believe
I have to wait in line to see my own sister.

47
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:20,357
I have never waited in any kind of
formation before, let alone a line.

48
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:24,202
- Wow, is this whole room just her work?
- Don't be fooled, Chidi.

49
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:25,698
Kamilah is a charlatan.

50
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,074
All she has to do is paint some dumb shapes
and people go mad.

51
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,625
Those aren't dumb shapes.
They're a pair of boobs.

52
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,369
And then two extra side boobs.

53
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:38,125
It symbolises that boobs come in all shapes
and sizes, and distances apart.

54
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,220
Ugh. Maybe we should just go, there are
plenty of other people I could help.

55
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,867
Like my good friend Ben Affleck,
and his crippling addiction to back tattoos

56
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,473
or my other good friend Matt Damon

57
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:48,579
and his crippling addiction
to my friend Ben Affleck.

58
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:50,060
It's important that you make amends.

59
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,771
Your competitive relationship with Kamilah
is largely the reason

60
00:02:52,816 --> 00:02:54,416
that you didn't get into the Good Place.

61
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,942
Stands to reason that the same
would be true for her.

62
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,029
Fine.

63
00:02:58,238 --> 00:02:59,649
But the waiting is over.

64
00:02:59,865 --> 00:03:01,825
Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me!

65
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,403
Tahani! Were you waiting
in a line to see me?

66
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:07,862
That's hilarious.

67
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:11,248
As a frog stares up in awe at the treetops

68
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:14,623
so too does humanity gawk at the purity
of a blinding truth.

69
00:03:15,088 --> 00:03:16,670
Napkins and forks are in the back.

70
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:19,336
So making omelettes is art now, is it?

71
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:21,588
Not that I'd expect you to understand

72
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:25,171
but it's a commentary on the world's
fascination with subservience, consumption

73
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:27,222
death, and pedagogy.

74
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,809
Cheddar or Swiss?

75
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,456
Oh, no, I don't want an omelette.
I just came for a quick sisterly chat.

76
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:35,890
My sister, Tahani,
refuses to order an omelette.

77
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:38,560
As a result, the exhibit is now over

78
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,153
and will never be shown again.
There will be no refunds.

79
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,909
Hey now! I just checked my Apple Watch

80
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:57,086
and it's "Marg-o-clock!"

81
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,798
- So, Michael, what do you do?
- Ah.

82
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:03,001
Well, um... I'm an architect.

83
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:04,385
Get outta here! Me too!

84
00:04:04,638 --> 00:04:06,254
- Huh!
- Dave's real good.

85
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,715
You should see the new Hooters on I-15.

86
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:11,267
It looks classy, like a bank.

87
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:13,686
So, how did you two love-rats meet?

88
00:04:13,772 --> 00:04:15,263
Oh, it's a fun story.

89
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:19,768
I was working on this project, tearing down
a condemned bar called The Desert Rash.

90
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:22,737
I went in to meet with the contractors,
and Diana is sitting at the bar

91
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,738
drinking a seven and seven and seven.

92
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:27,150
Seven shots of Seagram's Seven,
in seven minutes.

93
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:28,784
It's Diana's morning drink.

94
00:04:28,912 --> 00:04:30,995
Oh, that's right,
it was very early in the morning!

95
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,309
Well, this little spitfire finds out

96
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,916
it's me who's closing down the bar,
next thing I know

97
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:38,710
she's got a knife to my face!

98
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,192
I would've been scared if she hadn't been
the most gorgeous thing

99
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,003
- I've ever seen in my life.
- Aw.

100
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,344
One thing leads to another and all
of a sudden we're playing tonsil tennis

101
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:48,505
on a broken toilet in the alley out back.

102
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:49,881
Cute!

103
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:51,869
So how did you and Eleanor become friends?

104
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:53,475
Well, let's just say that we...

105
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,063
lived in the same... neighbourhood!

106
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:58,473
Oh!

107
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,775
What a fun way to say a normal thing, right?

108
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:04,020
Well, I've gotta go get ready,
today is PTA elections

109
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:05,279
and I'm running for secretary.

110
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,319
And she's a shoo-in, too. Hey, Patty!

111
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:08,900
We gotta get ready, OK?

112
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,995
I know we came here to set your mum
on a better path

113
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,993
but I think she's doing pretty great.

114
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,495
Please. She's completely full of it.

115
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:20,958
I am gonna find out what kind of scam
Donna Shellstrop is running

116
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:23,544
and I am gonna take her down.

117
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:26,341
Right after I finish this awesome drink.

118
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,219
- Man, Dave's margaritas are amazing.
- Right?

119
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,468
And I'm not even a tequila guy.

120
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:32,975
Wow.

121
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,761
So this is what a museum looks like.

122
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:43,268
If you look at this painting closely,
you can really notice the interpretation.

123
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:46,654
I know you're just being silly,
and effortlessly charming

124
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:50,282
but you actually just picked the most
valuable painting in the entire museum.

125
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:55,072
As of last year, that work was valued
at 39.2 million dollars.

126
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, snap, I forgot you know everything!
How much is that one worth?

127
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:01,793
That one is worth 13.7 million dollars.

128
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,214
That one's got a bunch of colours!
That's gotta add some value.

129
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,291
Can we do this for all the paintings?

130
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,718
Look. I've had a sort of...

131
00:06:10,138 --> 00:06:13,802
revelation about the world,
and I'd like to take responsibility

132
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,888
for my part in our fraught history.

133
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:22,982
For whatever hurt I've caused you,
I sincerely apologise.

134
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,152
Thank you.

135
00:06:25,946 --> 00:06:28,609
I do not accept your apology.
Is that all, then?

136
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,118
Well...

137
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:39,333
Oh!

138
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:46,298
Urgh!

139
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:49,216
Check out what Dave gave me.

140
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:54,965
Plans for a Subaru dealership-slash-burlesque
club he's designing in Reno!

141
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:57,345
Man, Nevada's a mess!

142
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,520
What are you doing?

143
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,855
Searching for the tell-tale sign
of a Donna Shellstrop scam.

144
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,313
A pile of cash hidden somewhere,
so she can grab it and head out on the run.

145
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:08,861
When the time comes,
she will rip this guy off

146
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:11,113
and disappear like Keyser Soze...

147
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,733
right after he admitted
to groping all those people.

148
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:15,822
- Why are you in my room?
- Oh, hey, girl!

149
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:18,363
What's up? How old are you, three?

150
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:19,867
- I'm nine.
- Cool.

151
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,494
I don't know anything about kids.

152
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:27,247
Hey, has Diana ever made you hide, like,
a special treasure in any of your toys?

153
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,549
No, Diana's very nice to me.
She bought me most of these stuffed animals.

154
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:33,010
Oh, wow! Neat.

155
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:35,679
Mind if I give him just a little surgery
just to check?

156
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:40,135
OK, OK, OK, alright, Doc McStuffins,
let's get you some fresh air.

157
00:07:40,353 --> 00:07:41,514
I'm so sorry.

158
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:44,806
She's a kid. You can't disembowel her toys.

159
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,485
Fine. New plan, you casually mention
that you're rich, and seduce Donna.

160
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:53,106
When she goes for you, it will prove
that this whole thing is a sham!

161
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:55,533
First things first, do you have a penis?

162
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:57,409
I will not seduce Donna.

163
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,242
For one thing,
I could never do that to my pal Dave.

164
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:05,043
It goes against the architect's code.
Also, your mother seems happy here.

165
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,335
The Donna I know wouldn't be caught dead
in this suburban boredom factory.

166
00:08:09,758 --> 00:08:12,091
She's scamming them!
Look, believe me, don't believe me.

167
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,668
I don't care, I'm gonna prove it.

168
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,134
Young lady, you will stop this nonsense

169
00:08:17,432 --> 00:08:20,470
go to the PTA meeting,
and support your mother.

170
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:22,389
I won't hear another word about it!

171
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:25,147
What the hell was that?

172
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,941
Well, I was going for the "stern" but,
you know, "caring dad" vibe.

173
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:30,152
No? Didn't work?

174
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:32,319
No, not even close.
Like, not in the ballpark.

175
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:35,573
I was trying something, Eleanor.
Give me a break.

176
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:40,407
Until Kamilah accepts my apology,
this open wound will hinder any progress

177
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:42,141
she might make toward
getting into the Good Place.

178
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:44,999
Also, I'm going to strangle her

179
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:47,994
which will hinder any air
from getting into her lungs.

180
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:49,795
Can I talk to her?

181
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,498
Maybe we should try a little
third-party mediation.

182
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:59,092
Uh, hi. I'm Tahani's friend, Chidi.

183
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:01,682
Chidi is an Igbo word
that means "God exists."

184
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,051
That's right. Sorry...

185
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:06,888
I don't know the etymology
of your name, but...

186
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,983
All of your fears... are now mine.

187
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,230
- What did she say?
- What?

188
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,613
I don't know. Sorry, I got distracted.

189
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:23,408
She's amazing! All of my fears are hers now!

190
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:24,614
Of course they are.

191
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,919
Um...

192
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:33,961
I sincerely apologised to you because
I have matured into a fully-formed adult

193
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,007
with empathy and self-awareness.

194
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,843
But if you don't accept my apology

195
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:42,131
I will smash your stupid art exhibit
into bits!

196
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:45,059
More Tahani theatrics,
with zero follow-through.

197
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:47,678
You don't have it in you
to do anything that bold

198
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,222
because I'm the one
who got the boldness gene.

199
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:52,933
And the good eyebrow gene.

200
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,070
Oh!

201
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:57,647
Oh, no! All my fears are mine again!

202
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,734
Hey, Davey, can you believe the design
of this room?

203
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:04,783
Auditorium? More like "audi-bore me-um."

204
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,291
Savage!

205
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:10,118
Hello, I'm Diana Tremaine.

206
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:12,790
I never thought I'd run for a PTA board.

207
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,664
For most of my life, I preferred to crawl.

208
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:18,375
Pub crawl!

209
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,719
But now, I want to make sure kids

210
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:23,468
in this decommissioned
military bombing test site

211
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:28,428
turned-suburban township
get the best education Nevada has to offer.

212
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:31,222
What's that, "always double down on 11"?

213
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:35,105
Also, there is a pretty great kid
who goes to this school

214
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:39,235
and I want to make this place great for her.
Stand up, sweetheart!

215
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:47,321
Well, it was the first Hooters
ever made out of brick.

216
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:49,873
- Sort of inspired by Monticello.
- Hey, mark.

217
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,001
- Oh, nope, it's Dave.
- I know your name.

218
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,706
I'm calling you a mark.

219
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:54,796
Easy.

220
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:56,668
I got news for you, dad-bod.

221
00:10:56,758 --> 00:11:00,672
The woman you know as Diana Tremaine
is really Donna Shellstrop

222
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:03,004
my much older mother.

223
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:05,764
She faked her death and changed her name.

224
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,342
Sorry to burst your bubble,
but that's the deal.

225
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:11,095
I already knew all that, Eleanor.

226
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:14,440
Your mother told me everything
the first night we met.

227
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:16,962
- The first night?
- Well, no, not the first night, actually.

228
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:18,852
That was mostly sex, you know...

229
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:22,152
Your mother is a very confident
and selfish lover.

230
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,066
- Yikes.
- Oh, no, no, it's perfect for me

231
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:27,486
cos I don't know what I want. But anyway,
the next morning she told me everything.

232
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,850
And we're gonna tell Patricia
once she's a little bit older.

233
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:33,959
- For now, everything is going great!
- No, dude, you don't know my mum.

234
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,370
She used to put like 50 things
in a shopping cart

235
00:11:36,464 --> 00:11:39,832
then go to the "12 items or less" aisle,
scream "Rat!"

236
00:11:39,884 --> 00:11:41,546
and run out the door without paying.

237
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:42,922
She is a liar.

238
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:45,258
Well, listen, she has been nothing
but honest with me

239
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:49,141
and I like that she's got a wild streak,
kinda gets my motor running!

240
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:53,600
Tell you the truth, she's turning me
into a bit of a bad boy!

241
00:11:53,731 --> 00:11:56,189
I mean, who am I, Avril Lavigne?

242
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:02,946
Oh, I get it.

243
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,407
Coming clean was all part of the scam!

244
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:07,784
It's brilliant,
because he thinks she's honest

245
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,913
so when she runs off with all his money,
he'll never see it coming.

246
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:13,912
Come on, Eleanor. I changed. You changed.

247
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:16,119
- Maybe she changed, too.
- No.

248
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,130
No way.

249
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:21,967
Why can't you accept that she might be
living a good, honest life?

250
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,510
That she's an attentive partner
and a good mum?

251
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,512
Because I wanted that mum!

252
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:32,681
I wanted the mum who made me afternoon snacks
instead of just telling me to look for

253
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:34,937
loose fries in the McDonald's ball pit.

254
00:12:35,106 --> 00:12:36,688
Why does Patricia get that mum?

255
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,524
If Donna Shellstrop has truly changed

256
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:41,819
then that means she was always capable
of change

257
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:44,947
but I... I just wasn't worth changing for.

258
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:52,238
I-I know as your self-appointed father figure
I'm supposed to say something

259
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,909
comforting here, but I'm...
I'm kinda stumped.

260
00:12:56,336 --> 00:12:58,373
OK, final tally!

261
00:12:58,463 --> 00:13:01,001
Forty-three votes for Diana Tremaine.

262
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,207
12 votes for Eileen Capshaw.

263
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:06,627
And one vote for "Bofa Deeznutz."

264
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:11,090
Oh, don't look at me like that.
You're not my real dad.

265
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:20,016
Congratulations, Madame Secretary.

266
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:23,394
So crazy, right?
I'm gonna need to get a calculator!

267
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:27,528
And maybe a globe?
I don't really understand the job.

268
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:31,986
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry that I didn't think
this whole thing was real.

269
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:36,123
I just never thought I'd see the day
when you made a commitment to...

270
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:37,793
anything.

271
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,996
I was wrong.

272
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:41,879
Thank you, baby.
That means a lot.

273
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:44,675
Let me help you.

274
00:13:44,884 --> 00:13:46,444
No, no, no, not that one! Not that one!

275
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:49,219
No, sorry, sorry,
this powder is only for my delicates.

276
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:51,675
You don't wash your bras.

277
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:53,306
No! No...

278
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,221
I knew it!

279
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:57,849
- Ugh...
- My mother is a con artist!

280
00:13:58,272 --> 00:13:59,433
Gotcha!

281
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,729
So, before I'm tortured in the afterlife

282
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:08,031
I get to spend the rest of this life
in a Hungarian prison for destruction of art!

283
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:09,649
That's fun!

284
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:12,359
Destruction of extremely derivative art.

285
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:14,786
Kamilah's work has been mediocre for years.

286
00:14:14,997 --> 00:14:18,866
Mother and father are probably rolling over
in their cryogenic chambers.

287
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:20,043
Really?

288
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:24,330
You don't think they would be proud of her
for having a whole museum wing

289
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:25,873
dedicated to her work?

290
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:31,387
My parents' standards were incredibly high
and they were impossible to please.

291
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:34,636
Plus they always pitted my sister and me
against each other.

292
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:38,310
The two of them were a unit,
and Kamilah and I...

293
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,438
Girls. We have a new challenge for you.

294
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:50,026
Each of you has four hours to complete
a rendering of your favourite moment

295
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:51,986
in French Military History.

296
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:56,032
The winning painting shall be hung
in our foyer during our party

297
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,912
honouring François Mitterrand.

298
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:01,041
The losing painting shall provide
the kindling for the fire

299
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:04,954
that rages in our hearth during that party.

300
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:06,796
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

301
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,506
Yes, Mother, it does.

302
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,125
Thank you for this opportunity.

303
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:14,551
Who will be the winning artist,
and who will fail?

304
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,307
Let's find out!

305
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,392
These paintings...

306
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:27,354
they're us.

307
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:28,695
You're the boobs?

308
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,863
Sorry, once Jason said it,
that's all I can see.

309
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,412
Here we go...

310
00:15:38,206 --> 00:15:39,206
What?

311
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,117
Tahani, what are you doing? Stop it.

312
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:45,624
No. I'm going to hug you because I love you.

313
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,668
And because you feel just as alone as I do.

314
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,755
I'm sorry our parents were such wankers.

315
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:55,887
And I understand
that you can't accept my apology

316
00:15:55,932 --> 00:15:58,640
because that would quench
your creative thirst.

317
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:03,183
They forced us to compete,
and that competition has fuelled your art

318
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:04,479
for decades.

319
00:16:05,024 --> 00:16:08,313
It's so awful, and I'm so sorry.

320
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:14,985
They were wankers, weren't they?

321
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:18,952
Oh! The absolute biggest wankers on Earth.

322
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:25,451
Let them go, please.

323
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:31,842
Mwah!

324
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:35,131
Diana Tremaine, you little devil.

325
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:37,007
New name, same game.

326
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:38,306
Fine.

327
00:16:38,516 --> 00:16:41,259
Things have been going good with me and Dave

328
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:45,392
but sometimes I sneak a little bit of cash
out of his wallet and I hide it away

329
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:48,645
just in case everything blows up
and I need to skip town.

330
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:49,734
Are you happy?

331
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,277
Actually, no. I'm not happy.

332
00:16:53,948 --> 00:16:55,280
But I think you are.

333
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:57,658
You're holding on to this exit strategy

334
00:16:57,743 --> 00:17:00,861
telling yourself that you can bail
at any time, but the truth is

335
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,198
you love this suburban life.

336
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,332
I don't love it so much.

337
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:08,334
I am not basic!

338
00:17:08,671 --> 00:17:09,671
Ya basic!

339
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:10,878
No, Mum...

340
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:12,838
ya basic.

341
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,257
And that's OK.

342
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:17,878
Let me ask you something,
why are you wearing yoga pants?

343
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:22,466
Well, on Tuesday nights I do restorative yoga
with a bunch of mums from Patty's school.

344
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,052
- And what do you do after yoga?
- We split avocado egg rolls

345
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:27,767
at the Cheesecake Factory,
but we also drink!

346
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:29,681
- What do you drink?
- Chardonnay.

347
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:32,275
With ice cubes.

348
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:34,569
And after one glass, I get sleepy

349
00:17:34,906 --> 00:17:38,445
so I usually switch to water
so I can drive home

350
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:40,067
like a nerd!

351
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:41,197
Hey, hey.

352
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,661
It's OK.

353
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:45,830
It's good. You're happy here.

354
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:49,623
But you need to commit to this

355
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,044
which means getting rid of that stash
of escape money.

356
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,255
And I think you know
what you have to do with it.

357
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:00,254
Send it to Gene Simmons?

358
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,348
What? No.

359
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,382
Spend it on Patricia.

360
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:07,640
Set up a college fund, buy her a... crib.

361
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:11,690
Or a car? I-I truly don't know anything
about kids, but...

362
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:17,609
this is your chance to break the chain
of Shellstrop-mother-daughter crappiness.

363
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,404
You have a do-over. Use it.

364
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,370
Oh, baby.

365
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:26,697
It seems like you've turned into
a really good person

366
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:31,035
and you clearly didn't get that from me, so,
props to whoever helped you.

367
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:34,917
Is there more cash in your bra?

368
00:18:34,966 --> 00:18:36,958
Always, that's why I don't wash them.

369
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,758
I still can't believe that police officer
pulled you over just to tell you

370
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:44,298
that you were driving perfectly.

371
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:46,054
Why not? I was!

372
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,978
There is an article in the paper
about Kamilah's latest art installation

373
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:51,106
and look.

374
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:55,063
"A Fractured Inheritance"
by Kamilah Al-Jamil and...

375
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:56,688
Tahani Al-Jamil.

376
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:59,646
Gosh. That was very big of her.

377
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:05,244
Though she really should have named the piece
"A Buried Hatchet," don't you think?

378
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:06,699
Such a better title!

379
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:09,323
- I'm going to call her and rub it in!
- Maybe don't.

380
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,417
For now.

381
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,501
Yes.

382
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:12,585
Smart.

383
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,498
Good luck, buddy. Oh!

384
00:19:14,547 --> 00:19:16,914
Hey, I almost forgot,
I sketched you up a little something.

385
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:19,837
Some ideas there for your, uh...
your project.

386
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:21,213
- Wow!
- Yeah.

387
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:24,304
Well, this is more than a few ideas,
you solved the whole thing!

388
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,881
Columns, and porticos...

389
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:27,058
Uh-oh.

390
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:29,931
Looks like you forgot to include bathrooms.

391
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:32,229
Oops. Well, just a little oversight.

392
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:35,394
I certainly use the bathroom,
like anybody else.

393
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,147
Love to sit on the... the thing and just,
you know

394
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:39,237
shoot one out.

395
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:40,695
Eleanor, I'll be in the car!

396
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,200
It was really nice to meet you, Patricia.
Got a lot of people who care about you here.

397
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,865
And good luck with the...

398
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,447
- SATS.
- I'm nine.

399
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,783
Whatever, good luck in school, you get it.

400
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:58,626
The others are on their way back
from Budapest.

401
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:01,041
We'll be picking them up in a few hours.

402
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,176
Oh, be happy!

403
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:07,973
Your mum found a better path all on her own,
and you definitely helped Patricia.

404
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,384
- Double happy ending.
- I know, I'm just...

405
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,722
I'm a little sad.

406
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:16,853
I'm glad my mum has changed, but that doesn't
fix all the damage she did to me.

407
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:20,481
Let's face it, she's the reason
I could never get close to anyone.

408
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:23,397
I never even told a boyfriend I love him.

409
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,907
Oh, crap. Um...

410
00:20:28,496 --> 00:20:32,866
You remember how I told that you knew
everything important about your life?

411
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:36,702
Well, I wasn't thinking about
your afterlife life.

412
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:40,798
In one of the reboots, you and...
and Chidi fell in love.

413
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,541
Deeply, and...

414
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,214
you told him that you loved him, and...

415
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:48,012
and he told you that he loved you back.

416
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:50,517
We did what now?

417
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:52,930
Do you wanna listen to a podcast, maybe?
