1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:03,666
OK, the five of us narrowly avoided death.

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,077
The operating theory

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:07,370
of this experiment is that...

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,922
So, I give them ethics problems
and we scan their brains

5
00:00:17,015 --> 00:00:19,132
and we get a sense
of their baseline moral instincts.

6
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:20,679
Right. Then I'll show them pictures

7
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:22,872
that trigger memories
of their near-death experiences.

8
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:25,639
We'll scan again,
and see if we get a different result.

9
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:29,650
For example, I'll show Jason
pictures of: a safe...

10
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,320
a snorkel, and whip-it canisters.

11
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,199
Got it. Also, what a grim death
that would've been.

12
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:38,906
Darling, do you remember all the rules
about what can

13
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:40,988
and cannot be worn inside an MRI?

14
00:00:41,206 --> 00:00:45,075
More specifically,
what if one's brassiere is very thin

15
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:48,078
but also very pure... gold.

16
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:51,581
I dunno but I'm in a similar "situ-aysh"

17
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,634
because the sports bra I'm wearing
is kind of rust-coloured

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,134
underneath the armpits, so I guess
we'll roll the dice together.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,223
Hey, Eleanor, do I have
the right phone number for you?

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,394
You haven't responded
to any of the dank memes I've sent!

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,891
Oh, yeah, I...

22
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:08,473
cos I was laughing too hard to reply.

23
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:11,522
OK, what's your "fave?"
Cos mine's "Damn, Daniel!"

24
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,812
"Back at it again with the white Vans!"

25
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:16,818
- Should we get started maybe?
- Oh, Mrs Teacher...

26
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,821
for my turn, is there any way to get like...

27
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:23,746
- extra radiation?
- There is no radiation in an MRI.

28
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:25,915
- But why do you ask?
- Uh, no reason.

29
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:28,664
Jason, what have you got
in your hand there, bud?

30
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,541
- Nothing.
- Is it a spider?

31
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:33,589
- Yes.
- Do you think taking a spider

32
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:36,088
in an MRI machine
will give you super powers?

33
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:38,511
Hey, it might work. He already bit me
a bunch of times

34
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:40,888
and gave me the power to swell up my hand!

35
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:42,931
- Oh, my God!
- What?

36
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:49,438
- Trevor.
- Hey, Mikey, fancy seeing you down on Earth

37
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:51,357
completely illegally.

38
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,851
Sweet outfit.

39
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:56,905
Dick Tracy called, he said you're a butt-face
and he's been ploughing your mum.

40
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:59,157
Yeah, well, Dick Tracy called me too, first.

41
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:02,736
And he said he was about to call you
and say a lie about me

42
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,697
that was actually true about you, instead.

43
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:07,667
Whatever.

44
00:02:07,918 --> 00:02:09,705
What are you doing here, Trevor?

45
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,378
Shawn hacked the Judge's system,
and we caught you cheating

46
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:14,706
getting your four little cockroaches
to meet up.

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,464
What? You think we were just gonna sit
around in the Bad Place blowin' beefers

48
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:21,171
while you're down on Earth
boning us in the meat-hole?

49
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:24,136
So, why didn't Shawn just go
to the Judge and turn me in?

50
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,851
Because this way's more fun, knuckle-nuts!

51
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,223
First of all...

52
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:31,769
I'm currently formulating a better comeback
to your Dick Tracy burn

53
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,649
and it's gonna devastate you.

54
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,310
Second, you're too late...

55
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:37,987
because when I did this experiment
in my Neighbourhood

56
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:42,443
every time Eleanor asked Chidi for help,
their bond became unbreakable

57
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,736
and the entire group improved.

58
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,241
No, you're right.

59
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:50,826
There's no way I'll get one of these bozos
to drop out of an unpaid

60
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:54,458
rigorous academic, study, especially
when they're doing it with me...

61
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:56,665
their overeager new best friend.

62
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, I should head back.
You want to come with?

63
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:01,837
Oh, right, they've all seen you already

64
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:04,471
so you can't show your face to them again...

65
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:07,221
so you're powerless to stop me.

66
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,226
Later days, dingus.

67
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:13,264
Dick Tracy called back, on his watch phone

68
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,350
and said you better watch out!

69
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:17,936
Shoot. A second too late.

70
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:23,530
OK, uh, Simone's gotta analyse the scans,
so why don't the rest of you head home?

71
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:26,157
- Good first day, everyone.
- Hey, Teach. Um...

72
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:28,658
do you think maybe...

73
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,500
we could continue the one-on-one lessons
on the side?

74
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:35,377
I feel like, last week, I had my own
personal ninja master

75
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:40,133
and now I'm taking tai chi
with bunch of farting housewives.

76
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:44,300
Between the new project and my classes,
I won't have time.

77
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:47,553
But this is way better!
You're still gonna learn a lot

78
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:50,556
and you'll have a fun group of people
to study with outside of class!

79
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:52,558
- But...
- Hey, gang!

80
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,393
I just had a neat idea.

81
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:55,940
Let's all go sight seeing.

82
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:58,484
- Dope!
- Yeah, we can check out Sydney

83
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,778
get to know each other, bond.

84
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:03,735
What do you say, E-Street Band,
you up for a Segway tour of...

85
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:05,657
Australia, mate?

86
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:09,195
This is a knife, on the barbie.

87
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:10,909
Cool idea.

88
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:13,457
I'm just worried that maybe
it's too cool.

89
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:17,583
I think I'm just gonna find the nearest bar,
have one or eight drinks and hit the hay.

90
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:19,042
Even better, we'll all go

91
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,964
"bend an elbow".

92
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:24,635
Actually, I know the perfect place
for homesick Americans!

93
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:28,598
Hi, dudes!

94
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:31,142
Welcome to the Cowboy
Skyscraper Buffet!

95
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:35,643
Oh, hey, can we get the Florida table?
They absolutely nail the swamp stench!

96
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:37,856
Aw, someone's seated there.

97
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:41,527
But if you purchase our "Manifest Destiny"
package for 30 dollars

98
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:44,276
you can have anyone you want
forcibly removed from the table.

99
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:45,781
We'll just sit anywhere.

100
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:48,614
When your table's ready,
this gun will go off!

101
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,537
I think... this is real.

102
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:57,918
So listen up, y'all.

103
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,296
I was so excited to join the group

104
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:03,750
that I made sweatshirts!

105
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:05,301
You get a sweatshirt.

106
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,136
You get a sweatshirt.

107
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,700
- You get a sweatshirt.
- I get a sweatshirt.

108
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:09,885
The Brain-y Bunch.

109
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,058
Awesome! I love being on teams!

110
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,181
And if we're on a
team now, we need nicknames!

111
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:18,015
Optimus, Bumblebee, Jazz, uh...
Megatron.

112
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:21,021
That's what you can each call me.
Now we need nicknames for you guys.

113
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:22,985
Ah, this is the best!

114
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,109
I'm gonna get the first round
and we are all gonna toast to Eleanor

115
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,659
The reason we're all here! Yay, Eleanor!

116
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:33,329
Oh, well if you guys are celebrating,
I recommend the jalapeno poppers.

117
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:35,239
Hi there, I'm Janet.

118
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,733
I'll be taking care of you tonight.

119
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:41,420
Can I get you started with some drinks?

120
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:44,715
Our specialty cocktail tonight
is "The Fourth of July".

121
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,470
It's half an apple pie, blended
with Southern Comfort and Coca Cola

122
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,300
served in a Chevy hubcap.

123
00:05:50,348 --> 00:05:52,806
Why don't you just go get us
a round of beers?

124
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,183
Of course. Here you go...

125
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,472
Sorry... I... will...

126
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,852
go... physically... pick those up...

127
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:05,855
I guess, and... then walk them
back here with my feet.

128
00:06:06,448 --> 00:06:08,440
But just so you know,
I will be here all night.

129
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:10,817
Watching everything...

130
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,786
that... you... order.

131
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:19,826
So, Ellie Baby. Brainstorm.
We should get a house!

132
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:24,589
Me, you, Tahani, Jason,
we should all go in together on a place!

133
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:26,586
- Roomies!
- Roomies!

134
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,050
That is...

135
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,423
technically an idea.

136
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:32,927
I think it would be "supes" fun.
We could play pranks

137
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:34,306
- on each other for my vlog.
- No.

138
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:36,258
We could do one of those
ice bucket challenges

139
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:37,580
- that I sent you.
- I don't think so.

140
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:39,220
- Not!
- Or maybe just a Harlem Shake?

141
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:40,763
I like to cook.

142
00:06:40,857 --> 00:06:42,627
And I have been dying to experiment
- Please stop.

143
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,253
- ... with Jamaican food, man.
- Please stop now!

144
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,563
I like-a Jamaican food.

145
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:48,153
Listen to the reggae and smoke da joint.

146
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,856
That's a Jamaican accent.

147
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,944
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

148
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:55,996
Hey, how's it going?

149
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,749
Not good, Michael. I don't have my powers.
I can't summon things.

150
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:01,576
Dictionary. Spaghetti.

151
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,919
Jet-ski. Giraffe. Gah!

152
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:05,496
Look what I've been reduced to!

153
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:06,915
Humans only live 80 years

154
00:07:07,008 --> 00:07:10,126
and they spend so much of it
just waiting for things to be over.

155
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,927
I'm all out of sorts down here, too.

156
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:14,931
I'm bad at lying now.
That used to be my thing!

157
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:18,184
And every part of my body is either
too dry or too wet.

158
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,636
It's worse for me, man!

159
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:23,853
Ever since we walked through that portal,
my knowledge has stopped updating.

160
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,732
The instant before we left

161
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,562
a man in Caracas, Venezuela
named Raul Benitez

162
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,567
was eating a ham sandwich.

163
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:34,025
Did he finish it? I don't know
and it's making me crazy!

164
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,485
- I gotta find him.
- Janet!

165
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,658
Focus on the mission!

166
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:40,239
We have to get Trevor away from the humans.

167
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,582
I am so glad you came out with us, man!

168
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:48,372
I just assumed you would think it's
unprofessional to be friends

169
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:49,752
with the subjects of your study.

170
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:51,337
No, I never thought that.

171
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:54,587
I mean, I... I kind of do now.

172
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:56,384
Should I not be socialising?

173
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:59,224
I'm sure it's fine. I mean,
how much harm could it possibly do.

174
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,561
Good point.

175
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,269
Such a good point, that I'm gonna go think
about how good a point that is

176
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,645
over there, by myself,
for several minutes. Excuse me.

177
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:10,857
Hey, "El-Train"...

178
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:14,490
you think with all these new Star Wars movies
they'll finally make a new Spaceballs?

179
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:17,159
I'm sorry, I'm getting a text,
and I have to take this.

180
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,327
OK, everybody...

181
00:08:19,372 --> 00:08:21,739
here are your beers

182
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,122
and here is yours. Oh no!

183
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,206
Oh...

184
00:08:26,296 --> 00:08:29,414
I guess you should go to the bathroom,
or maybe go home and never come back.

185
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,332
No worries. I made extra sweatshirts!

186
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:33,842
Besides, we're having too much fun to leave.

187
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:37,722
Hey, speaking of fun, I know this super-fun
drinking game we can play.

188
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:42,222
Every time one of you says something
that the other can't relate to

189
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:43,428
you both drink.

190
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:46,980
Could be fun. I once played a drinking game
with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively

191
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:48,478
at their macrobiotic farm

192
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,775
with a particularly robust batch
of homemade kombucha.

193
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:55,402
Do I have to drink for every word
I don't know?

194
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:57,404
Up to you. Just drink.

195
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:59,952
Ooh, hey, what happened with Chidi

196
00:08:59,996 --> 00:09:01,112
and where's Eleanor?

197
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,323
This... this... this is all moving too fast!

198
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,991
Can we just take Trevor out?

199
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:07,855
I don't know if he can die, but I could drop
a steamroller on his head.

200
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,041
Oh, darn it! I can't summon things!

201
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,833
I guess I could kick him with my soft feet?

202
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,293
- Earth sucks!
- You stay on Trevor.

203
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:17,169
Keep interfering with his plan, alright?

204
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:20,882
I'm gonna do my librarian act
and nudge Chidi back to the table.

205
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,140
Oh! Yummy!

206
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,847
You gotta relax, man, you're off the clock.

207
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:29,682
It's just a simple drink with friends

208
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,270
at the world's worst restaurant.

209
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:32,943
No, but Trevor's right.

210
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,113
I might skew the study
by fraternising with the subjects.

211
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,280
We can be colleagues.

212
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:39,282
"Associates" is pushing it.

213
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:43,158
And by even having this conversation,
you're becoming my confidant!

214
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,822
I can't have that.

215
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:49,581
Geez, I kinda thought that before everyone
else showed up, you and I were...

216
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:52,125
like becoming actual friends.

217
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:55,257
Oh no, you're right! What have I done?

218
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:59,215
OK, OK. I... I'm gonna go...
to the bar and get you a hot tea.

219
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:01,388
- OK.
- Or a regular-temperature Xanax.

220
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:03,557
- Mm.
- Try not to fall apart.

221
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:06,936
Professor Anagonye!

222
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:09,312
Oh, yeah, I thought I recognised you.

223
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:11,724
It's me, the librarian, from the library.

224
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:13,855
Oh, right. Hi!

225
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,313
Sorry, uh... I was just kind of
in the middle of something here.

226
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:18,856
Well, maybe I can help.

227
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:21,575
You know what I like to do
in situations like these?

228
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:24,661
I haven't told you anything
about what I'm going through.

229
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:26,990
Do that first.

230
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,325
Then I'll tell you
what I'd do in situations

231
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,206
such as the one you're about to describe.

232
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,787
I've been in every situation.

233
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,372
Cos I'm a librarian.

234
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:35,924
Hit me, go ahead.

235
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,842
- Mm...
- Ah-la-la-la.

236
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:40,548
I'm tired.

237
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:42,505
Does anybody want a gallon of water

238
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,285
- to sober up?
- No thanks, sweetheart.

239
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:46,301
I just called a car for these two lovebirds.

240
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:48,386
So why don't you just bring us the cheque?

241
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:51,055
Oh, and you should smile more...

242
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:52,518
you'll get bigger tips.

243
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,273
- Gosh, you're pretty.
- No.

244
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:57,404
You're pretty.

245
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:59,446
Pretty beautiful.

246
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,028
If you ask me, Chidi...

247
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:05,570
you need to get back over there, you know,
spend time with the team.

248
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:08,285
Though we do have a saying
in the library game.

249
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:11,367
Uh... "There's only room
for one male subject

250
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,793
in an academic study.

251
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:15,545
So keep the one who got there first".

252
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,583
- Catchy.
- Gotta go now.

253
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:21,043
Closest thing I could find to herbal tea
was a root beer

254
00:11:21,137 --> 00:11:22,844
I had them throw in the microwave.

255
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:24,721
Dou know what? Don't drink that!

256
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:26,535
I think I'm just gonna head home.

257
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,359
But you can go and spend time
with the others.

258
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,262
Yeah, man, that's not really
what I signed up for.

259
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:32,688
I mean, Tahani is... meh.

260
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,356
But Jason, woof!

261
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:35,933
And Trevor... urgh!

262
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:39,065
They're not the reason I flew
all the way from Arizona.

263
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:41,821
- You are.
- I'm sorry.

264
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:43,524
Uh... but this is just...

265
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,410
how it has to be.

266
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,695
I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

267
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,533
Hey, E-dog, get over here.

268
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,083
It's trivia night.

269
00:11:53,128 --> 00:11:55,541
First round questions are
all about Logan Paul

270
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,664
and you know I'm Lo-gang for life.

271
00:11:58,174 --> 00:11:59,819
Go put your head up your own butt.

272
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:00,879
- What?
- What?

273
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:01,927
What?

274
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,849
Oh, don't you butt-necks ever give up?

275
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:12,436
No, and what are you even doing in a
bathroom? You're a demon, you don't...

276
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,226
- need it.
- I like the smells.

277
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:17,148
And I like putting my hands in the toilet

278
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,522
so everything I touch gets a little bit
of poop on it.

279
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:21,653
Hey, you guys see what I did out there?

280
00:12:21,698 --> 00:12:25,988
I am so good, I got Eleanor
to leave a bar... early!

281
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:29,195
Chidi's melting down,
Jason and Tahani just left together.

282
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,827
If they hook up, she's on the first
private jet out of here.

283
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,286
This was too easy!

284
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,914
Gonna take a lot more than that
to break up this group.

285
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,211
Why don't you give up, Trevor?

286
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:41,166
As long as we're here,
you'll never succeed.

287
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe, but how long will
that take?

288
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:45,051
I mean, at some point
the Judge will find out

289
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,378
that you're not in your little room
watching ticker tape.

290
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,090
Right? Tick, tick, tick, tick.

291
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,724
But hey, may the worst demon win.

292
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,270
Good luck, Mikey.

293
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:56,600
- Ha, poop hands!
- Oh!

294
00:12:56,691 --> 00:12:58,523
I can't believe you fell for that!

295
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,022
Are you alright?
You didn't sleep at all last night.

296
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,324
Yeah, I got a solid eight minutes.

297
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,743
Not consecutively,
but still. It's fine!

298
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:11,612
You're not even that blurry.

299
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:12,996
You gotta take it easy, man.

300
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,283
I mean, you're not sleeping.
Your eye is twitching.

301
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:17,789
This study has to be airtight.

302
00:13:17,837 --> 00:13:20,921
And this ethical question of friendship

303
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:22,922
with the subjects is weighing on me.

304
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,361
I've done a million of these things.

305
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:26,627
I promise I'll warn you
if you cross any lines.

306
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:29,839
I don't want to come anywhere near
those lines!

307
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:34,013
I have been waiting my entire career
for the right thesis

308
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:35,844
and I am not going to blow it.

309
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,188
I have to keep this professional.

310
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,895
Fine. But you need to get some rest.

311
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:42,356
This morning you bit into a raw egg
like it was an apple.

312
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:44,440
I thought it was hard boiled.

313
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,272
Yeah, but still the shell.

314
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,692
This is the best secret friend
handshake, bro.

315
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:50,905
And it goes...

316
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:53,450
Attention everyone, do not look at me!

317
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:55,910
Oh, I don't... don't know
what to do.

318
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,293
I am both over hung and humiliated

319
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,704
by my uncouth comportment
last night.

320
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:04,339
Please accept
these formal letters of apology.

321
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:06,633
Further apologies for their appearance.

322
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:09,462
I just couldn't find a proper calligrapher
at five in the morning.

323
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:12,257
So what happened to you two love birds
last night, huh?

324
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,683
- Frankly, it is none of your business.
- Uh, sorry.

325
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:17,645
Jason was a perfect gentleman last night.

326
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:20,849
Thank you so much
for getting me home safely.

327
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,144
I wouldn't blame you, should you
ostracise me for my boorish behaviour.

328
00:14:25,196 --> 00:14:26,903
You weren't boring, you were fun.

329
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,866
Crazy story. After you got into the cab,
I forgot where I lived

330
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,786
but then I looked across the street
and there was a motel.

331
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:37,414
And behind that there was a dumpster.
I slept in a dumpster.

332
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:40,621
- Jason!
- No, no, no, it was fine.

333
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,037
And it was super fun getting to know you.

334
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:45,043
You're the fanciest person I know.

335
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:47,083
Next to my friend Ronnie, who drives a limo.

336
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:48,754
He's in limos all the time.

337
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,590
Oh, what a life.

338
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:54,048
Right. As soon as Eleanor gets here,
we'll begin.

339
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:56,555
Bad news, prof, Eleanor might not be coming.

340
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:58,594
She bailed right after you did last night.

341
00:14:58,646 --> 00:15:02,606
Seemed like she was having second thoughts
about being part of the brainy bunch, so...

342
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:04,395
Oh, well that's disappointing.

343
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:05,601
In... in terms of...

344
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:07,731
how it affects the study, but...

345
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:10,690
we press on, like professionals.

346
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:19,490
- Hey, do you think I should...
- Yeah.

347
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,854
And I already called you a car
because you should not drive.

348
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,710
- It's outside.
- Thanks.

349
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,250
Where's outside?

350
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:37,637
Hey, man.

351
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,471
Are you OK?

352
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:46,100
Sorry, uh, literally one second ago

353
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:50,229
I was at the front desk.
Uh, don't know where I got this.

354
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,198
Anyway, are you coming to class?

355
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,320
I just don't think
the group thing is for me.

356
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:58,995
I'm better when it's one-on-one

357
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:02,958
and we're both looking at our phones
and I don't know the other person

358
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:06,003
and we don't talk.
I might just head back to Arizona.

359
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,122
L... listen.

360
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:13,882
My whole life has been a...
a torture chamber of indecision

361
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:17,389
and now I'm finally on the path
to understanding why

362
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:20,847
and the only reason that's happening
is because you walked into my office

363
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:23,186
and you said you wanted
to be a better person.

364
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,638
That was really brave.

365
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:29,602
Now, I know we barely know each other but...
please could you give me three months?

366
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:33,986
Can you give me three months?
I am asking you as a friend.

367
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,192
See, I just told you I don't like talking.

368
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:40,617
That whole thing could have been sent
in a text that I pretended I never saw.

369
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:46,626
Fine. You did good at talking.
I'll come back to class.

370
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:51,249
Come in. No?

371
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,008
- I'm gonna drive you back.
- OK.

372
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:55,923
Hey.

373
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:57,925
Hey, Dick Tracy called...

374
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:02,344
said that I was right about Eleanor
and Chidi having an unbreakable bond.

375
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:04,331
I don't think you understand
how that joke works.

376
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:07,189
Yeah, that doesn't matter.
We won, that's the point.

377
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:10,271
You won squat.
We're gonna get 'em eventually.

378
00:17:10,361 --> 00:17:13,195
I'll just keep chipping away
till one of 'em bails.

379
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:16,360
These four humans are all I care about
in the universe

380
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,867
and there is nothing, I mean nothing

381
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:20,444
that's gonna come between me...

382
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,745
Oh, cool. You're all together.

383
00:17:25,793 --> 00:17:26,954
The Judge wants to see you.

384
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:29,369
Now? Right now?

385
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,831
- Um, like all of us or...
- Yep.

386
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:34,883
So this is Earth, huh?

387
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:39,379
Whoo! Pretty cool.

388
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:53,693
Michael, how many times
did I say you could go down to Earth?

389
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,943
- Actually, you weren't 100% explicit...
- One time!

390
00:17:57,658 --> 00:18:00,071
I said you could go down there,
save their lives

391
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,079
start the new time line
and then come back here to observe them.

392
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,201
One time!

393
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,833
Is what I said. Un o!

394
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,127
One!

395
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,840
Your Honour, I have to say, I support you
one "hundo" percent.

396
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,919
I mean, what Michael did is unbelievable.

397
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:21,346
Now, granted, I also tricked the Doorman
and snuck down to Earth

398
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,719
but what are we gonna do...

399
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,976
Do you realise what you did?

400
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:28,770
You meddled in human affairs.

401
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:31,098
That ripples out, man.

402
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,064
Do you know how much weird stuff has happened
because of your little experiment?

403
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:36,353
England left Europe.

404
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:39,690
That Hugh Jackman musical
about P. T. Barnham...

405
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,699
it made like 400 million dollars.

406
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:45,572
Also, the Jacksonville Jaguars
are good now!

407
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:46,872
Impossible!

408
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,078
I ' m se ri ous!
They're gonna make the playoffs.

409
00:18:49,502 --> 00:18:52,119
Blake Bortles is kind of OK...

410
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,206
Maybe? I don't know, it's being debated
amongst experts.

411
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:59,043
It's confusing.
But whatever it is, it's yo' fault!

412
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:01,299
Your experiment with the humans is over.

413
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:03,088
- Are you gonna kill them?
- No.

414
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:05,174
But starting now...

415
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:07,384
there is no more monitoring them.

416
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:11,138
They're just regular humans that need
to hit the regular point threshold

417
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:12,709
to see if they make it into the Good Place.

418
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,144
- Hm...
- And if they don't...

419
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:25,285
And right now, the two of you
are going back to the Bad Place.

420
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:26,615
But they'll retire Michael.

421
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:28,367
And I'll be marbleised!

422
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:31,040
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that

423
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:34,374
before you intervened in human affairs!

424
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,465
I mean, because of you, Byron Allen owns
The Weather Channel now.

425
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,378
- Is-is that bad?
- I don't know, but it's weird, man!

426
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,964
Now, come with me.

427
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:47,349
Hey, my powers are back online.

428
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,747
This must be everything
I tried to summon on Earth.

429
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,806
- Stop it!
- I don't think I can. I'm like a printer

430
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,102
when the print queue suddenly starts
processing all the unprinted documents...

431
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,438
Oh, man! Buckle up, folks.

432
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:08,324
Let's go. Right now!

433
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:09,623
Jan et!

434
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:12,832
Make it stop! Janet, stop it!

435
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,289
Janet, this is annoying!

436
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:17,589
Jan et!

437
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,961
Good luck, frog man. I'm pulling for ya.

438
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:23,022
Janet, I know you're still there.

439
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,638
- They escaped.
- Yeah. Thanks, Jeff.
