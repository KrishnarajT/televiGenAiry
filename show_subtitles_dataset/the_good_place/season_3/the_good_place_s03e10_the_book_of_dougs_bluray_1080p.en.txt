1
00:00:03,867 --> 00:00:06,109
I can't put the humans back
in their own bodies

2
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:09,450
so I've done the next best,
but still not that great, thing!

3
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:12,164
A high-neck sleeveless?

4
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:14,367
I suppose this outfit will do.

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:18,626
Are you sure? I mean, wearing
a floral print to an infinite void

6
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,544
at this time of the nothing?

7
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:22,967
So, where are we, exactly?

8
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:26,342
- We're not on Earth, right?
- That's correct, Chidi-Janet, you're not.

9
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:29,349
Your real bodies dematerialised
when you entered my void

10
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:33,306
and your essences reconstituted themselves
in this form.

11
00:00:33,396 --> 00:00:34,682
Cool, cool.

12
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,765
And when you say "void"...?

13
00:00:36,858 --> 00:00:39,350
Oh, I mean a sub-dimension
outside of space and time

14
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:42,986
at the nexus of consciousness and matter,
tethered to my essence.

15
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:44,074
Does that help?

16
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:45,361
It does not help.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,907
Makes it way worse.

18
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:49,490
I just wanna lie down.

19
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:51,946
Where is down?

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,032
I found it! It's up here.

21
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:55,450
It's dope!

22
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:57,623
I have an idea.

23
00:00:58,004 --> 00:00:59,415
Sweet! I call sofa!

24
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:02,465
Janet's void has a back door
to the Janet Warehouse

25
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:05,752
in the Neutral Zone,
which is right near Accounting.

26
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:10,427
You four will stay here
while actual Janet and I sneak through it

27
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:14,018
- and find the Head Accountant.
- But Michael, why can't we go with you?

28
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:17,063
Well, you just "died," which means
you're the first humans in history

29
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:19,394
to not immediately
go to the Good or Bad Place

30
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:22,731
which in turn makes you
interdimensional fugitives.

31
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:24,069
So, that's neat.

32
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:27,489
Also the Judge is probably
still pissed at me for, you know

33
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:30,114
breaking all the rules,
and she might take it out on you.

34
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:33,070
Plus, the Bad Place
is probably hunting for us.

35
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:36,241
So, literally the entire universe
is against you.

36
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:38,125
OK, but what's a fourth really good reason?

37
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:42,292
Jeez. Just trying to lighten the mood.
Tough void.

38
00:01:42,382 --> 00:01:45,546
Now, Janet and I will pose
as Good Place employees

39
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:48,177
and sweet-talk the Accountant
into showing us his books.

40
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:53,516
If I'm right, we will find proof
that the Bad Place is tampering

41
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:54,804
with the points system.

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,683
The Accountant will tell us what to do,
and this will all be over.

43
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,597
We're almost at the end, guys.

44
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:03,230
Just stay here and keep Janets' heads
on straight.

45
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:05,437
Bye!

46
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:10,149
Is that a Good Janet or a Bad Janet?

47
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:11,404
That's a Neutral Janet.

48
00:02:11,494 --> 00:02:13,531
She's sort of the black sheep
of the Janet world.

49
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:15,495
Or the blank sheep, I guess.

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,123
Ooh, I can throw shade now! That's cool!

51
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:21,376
You've arrived at the Accounting office.

52
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,664
All point calculations for actions
taken on Earth are made here.

53
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:27,216
- End of conversation.
- My name is Michael.

54
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:30,841
I need to speak with the Head Accountant,
on official Good Place business.

55
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:33,214
I will inform the Head Accountant
of your presence

56
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:36,304
and he either will or will not see you
in a certain amount of time.

57
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:37,930
End of conversation.

58
00:02:38,772 --> 00:02:39,772
Wow.

59
00:02:42,192 --> 00:02:44,775
Good thing your "void" plan worked out, huh?

60
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:50,556
#... believe in life after love? â™ª

61
00:02:51,076 --> 00:02:52,076
Oh...

62
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:54,694
having four humans in my void is weird.

63
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:55,913
Ah.

64
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,488
This is nuts.

65
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,704
We're in a void,
in the body of a white lady...

66
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:02,194
- Not a lady.
- Not a lady, darling.

67
00:03:02,253 --> 00:03:03,253
But we are white!

68
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's all say white people things!

69
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,090
"Billy Joel!"

70
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:07,460
"I found it on Etsy."

71
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:08,966
"There was nowhere to park!"

72
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:10,551
"Did you refill the Brita?"

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,552
I find this void quite calming, actually.

74
00:03:12,722 --> 00:03:16,261
It's like, this time, the Xanax took me.

75
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:17,766
Oh, I have the worst stomach ache.

76
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,388
Dude, relax.

77
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:22,222
Here, let me see if I can figure this out...

78
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:25,107
Oh!

79
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,689
Wow, Eleanor! How'd you do that?

80
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:29,236
I dunno. We're Janets now.

81
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,322
So, I thought we'd have some bitchin'
Janet powers.

82
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:33,653
What just happened? What did you do?

83
00:03:33,785 --> 00:03:35,868
Sorry, I'm just trying to help Chidi calm...

84
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:38,529
The structural integrity of this void
is already at risk.

85
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:40,823
You can't start
randomly conjuring up objects.

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,791
Or it might shatter the void!

87
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:44,038
Yes, it might!

88
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:47,330
It might make everything blow up
and we'll all disappear forever!

89
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:48,424
Mwah!

90
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:49,882
So, stop it!

91
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,550
Everything OK?

92
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:56,765
Nope!

93
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:59,429
- Well...
- The Head Accountant has decided to see you.

94
00:03:59,477 --> 00:04:02,185
This will happen now. End of conversation.

95
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:04,356
Hi.

96
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:06,358
Hey-oh!

97
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,983
Ha, there they are. Good to see you.

98
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:10,527
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Neil, Head Accountant.

99
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:12,479
You must be Janet and Michael.

100
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:13,989
Yes.

101
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:16,317
Can I just say,
I really depreciate you coming.

102
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:19,737
Eh? Little bit of Accounting humour.

103
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:20,867
- Ha!
- Yeah.

104
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:24,659
- So, what can I do for you?
- Well, I'm concerned about certain...

105
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:26,623
anomalies, in the points system.

106
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:30,415
I'm worried that somehow,
the Bad Place has been tampering.

107
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,754
Tampering? No, no, no. Quite impossible.

108
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,011
Laughable, really.

109
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:36,091
Janet, can you remind me
to laugh at that later?

110
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:39,219
Your amusement has been scheduled.
End of conversation.

111
00:04:40,643 --> 00:04:41,759
She's a lot of fun.

112
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:43,970
Could you just humour us though?

113
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:47,063
- Show us how the system works?
- Uh...

114
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,919
well, I suppose I could give you
a quick tour.

115
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,276
We don't get a lot of visitors. Follow me.

116
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:56,319
Eleanor! How'd you know I always
wanted a dog like this?

117
00:04:56,743 --> 00:05:00,327
Funny story, it's one of the things I saw
in the alternate timeline

118
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:04,081
where we were soulmates on and off
for 300 years.

119
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:08,540
- Maybe we should talk about that?
- Well, I... suppose we can

120
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:10,955
but there's not that much to talk about.

121
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:15,259
The things you saw weren't part of my life,
so they didn't happen to me.

122
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:18,592
The hell are you talking about, man?
Of course it was you. I saw it.

123
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,929
Well, it was a Chidi, sure,
but it wasn't me Chidi.

124
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:25,352
This is a classic philosophical question,
the concept of "the self"

125
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:26,396
or "who we are"

126
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:29,936
philosophically speaking,
there's the Chidi I am

127
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:33,022
who lived a certain life,
and there's the Chidi you saw

128
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:37,948
your soulmate, or whatever,
who had some entirely different life.

129
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:40,137
Not the same Chidis.

130
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:42,198
I'm so sorry. Yeah, no, I get it.

131
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:44,947
Counterpoint, that's the dumbest thing
you've ever said

132
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:47,366
and you do not deserve a puppy!
I'm un-blooping your puppy!

133
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,789
Things are getting cuter
and I want them to get less cute!

134
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,513
So, this is the main feed.

135
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,925
Every action, by every human on Earth

136
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:07,470
is recorded and then sent here
to be assigned a point value

137
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:10,102
based on the absolute moral worth
of that action.

138
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:14,690
For example, a couple in Osaka, Japan
just decided to have a destination wedding.

139
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:16,320
Negative 1,200 points.

140
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:19,648
Oh, and it's a destination theme wedding.

141
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:21,074
Negative 4,300.

142
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,367
The theme's Lord of the Rings.
They're basically doomed.

143
00:06:25,498 --> 00:06:26,955
Ah! Here's fun.

144
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:30,580
This means that someone has just done
something which has never been done before.

145
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:35,214
Richard Moore of Sugarland Texas,
hollowed out an eggplant

146
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,168
and filled it with hot sauce and nickels.

147
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:40,670
And amazingly, it's not a weird sex thing!

148
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:43,931
99% percent of all new human behaviours
are weird sex things

149
00:06:43,975 --> 00:06:46,137
but not in this...
oh, no it is a weird sex thing.

150
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:48,969
Well, then we zip that over
to the relevant departments.

151
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:51,521
In this case, Anastasia
in the Stuffed Vegetable Department

152
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:54,024
we've got Hector over in American Coins

153
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,443
and my dear buddy Matt, in Weird Sex Things.

154
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,355
I'm still waiting on a response
to the request I filed

155
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,815
for immediate suicide?

156
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:02,199
Request denied.

157
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,485
I love Matty! He's hilarious.

158
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:08,998
So, they now examine the action,
its use of resources

159
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,824
the intentions behind it

160
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,329
- its effects on others...
- Correct, and you end up with this.

161
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,207
And here is why tampering is impossible.

162
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:22,378
Because this score is then double-checked
by three billion other accountants

163
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:23,674
all chosen at random

164
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:27,683
and if they all come to the same conclusion,
which they always do

165
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:28,843
it makes this official.

166
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:31,099
Anyone who does this same action
in the exact same way

167
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:32,638
loses this many points.

168
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:36,392
When people die, their biographical history
and final point totals

169
00:07:36,444 --> 00:07:38,106
are sent to the relevant destination.

170
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,028
This batch is going to the Bad Place.

171
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:41,988
Thank you, Doris.

172
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:46,740
The system is flawless
and tampering is quite impossible.

173
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:51,790
I see. Could we look at one specific file,
though, just to make sure?

174
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:54,619
Oh... Who do you wanna see? Genghis Khan?

175
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:55,587
Marie Antoinette?

176
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,750
Walt Disney's got some freaky stuff
in his file.

177
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,257
Doug Forcett.

178
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:03,301
I don't get this, man.

179
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,512
Why wouldn't you want to know
what our life was like?

180
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:08,761
You're not even a little bit curious
what it was like to hit this?

181
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:10,600
I don't mean this this.

182
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:13,600
Although, frankly,
I would also hit this this.

183
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:16,766
I don't want to see those memories
because, philosophically speaking

184
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:18,559
they're none of my business.

185
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:22,195
They happened to someone else.
Let me explain.

186
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,231
Take a seat.

187
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:26,275
Conceptions of the self!

188
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:30,742
Let's start with John Locke, who believed
that personal identity was based on

189
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,784
having a continued consciousness:
essentially, memory.

190
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,664
Memories are links in a chain that together
form a single self.

191
00:08:39,924 --> 00:08:41,665
If I can't remember what happened

192
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,714
because it happened to a Chidi
from another timeline

193
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:46,796
it's not a unified "me."

194
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:49,785
Just because you don't remember doing
something doesn't mean you didn't do it.

195
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,596
I have no idea how it happened

196
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:55,604
but there is definitely a tattoo on my butt
that says "Jasom."

197
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:58,523
- That brings us to Derek Parfit.
- It does?

198
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:02,019
Parfit said, even if I have memories
from an earlier time

199
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:04,821
that doesn't necessarily mean it was "me".

200
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:09,361
After all, if my brain was split in two
and each half was put in a different person

201
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,282
which one is "me"?

202
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:14,615
All I know is that other Chidi
doesn't exist anymore

203
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:18,703
and this one does,
so this must be the real Chidi.

204
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:22,252
And all I know is that you're just barfing
Wikipedia all over everyone

205
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,667
to avoid talking about your feelings.

206
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,549
Let's talk about David Hume!

207
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,470
Here we go. The Book of Dougs.

208
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:34,935
Let's have a look...

209
00:09:36,606 --> 00:09:39,349
Doug Forbush... Forcap...

210
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:40,850
Doug L. Forcett!

211
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:44,194
Hey-hey, no peeking. Accountants only.

212
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,693
Can you just tell me his total so far?

213
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:50,450
Looks like he's at... 520,000 points.

214
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,078
- Well done, Doug.
- So that's... that's good?

215
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,367
Oh, it's excellent.

216
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,915
Wait, he's 68 years old?

217
00:09:57,085 --> 00:09:58,701
Oh, that's terrible. He's screwed.

218
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:00,164
I knew it!

219
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:04,373
Doug has spent his entire life
being nothing but good.

220
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:08,381
He once found a dollar on the ground
and he sent it to the Canadian government

221
00:10:08,513 --> 00:10:13,133
to help pay down their national debt,
and he isn't even close to getting in?

222
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:16,264
- How can that be?
- Look, mate, the points are indisputable.

223
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,141
They have been since the beginning.

224
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,772
"Og gives his rock to Grog."

225
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:24,106
First ever act of human altruism.
Og earned 10,000 points that day.

226
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,063
Of course, then Grog used that
rock to beat Og's brains in

227
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:28,397
and lost a million points.

228
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:32,030
Point is the math is cold, objective,
and airtight

229
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,116
and unless you can prove otherwise,
I don't know how I can help you.

230
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:39,075
I just got 700 new "Weird Sex Thing" files
in the last one second.

231
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,335
Oh, yeah, Burning Man just started.

232
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:44,497
- Buckle up, Matty! It's gonna be a long week.
- No...

233
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:49,631
So, in essence, Hume thought that
we don't truly have a "self"

234
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,179
we're just a bundle of our ever-changing
impressions.

235
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:56,968
Just admit it, man. You're embarrassed
you fell in love with an Arizona trash-bag.

236
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,885
Eleanor, it's not personal.

237
00:10:59,063 --> 00:11:02,352
Someone fell in love with you,
it's just not "me".

238
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,312
I told you not to conjure anything!

239
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:07,857
Sorry, I... I... I just swapped
the living room for a classroom.

240
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:09,021
Not you, him.

241
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,115
- Jason, what is wrong with you?
- Sorry, Janet!

242
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,822
I didn't mean to conjure Pillboi.

243
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:16,824
I was just thinking about how much fun
we used to have hanging out

244
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:19,991
in his broken hot tub and then he showed up!

245
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,494
Yeah, I was just chillin, ' being nothing,
and then all of a sudden

246
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:25,045
- I "was"!
- Oh!

247
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,417
Goodbye, Pillboi.

248
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:27,425
Aw, dip!

249
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:29,758
I'm "not" again!

250
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:31,839
Oh...

251
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,764
You need to hurry.
My molecular essence is fragmenting

252
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:38,342
and it's giving me the worst headache.

253
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:42,646
OK, here's a question.
If Doug Forcett's not getting in, who is?

254
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:46,976
Let's look at one more file, someone who's
gotten into the Good Place this year.

255
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:49,486
Alright. Why don't we look at...

256
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:51,984
No one. No one got in.

257
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:54,524
No one's gotten in for a year?

258
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:57,323
- Correct.
- How about the last three years?

259
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:58,863
Alright, uh...

260
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,364
Beep, boop...

261
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:05,210
Uh, no one.

262
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,334
When was the last time someone got in?

263
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:10,833
The last time someone got enough points

264
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:12,842
to get into the Good Place was...

265
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:14,928
521 years ago.

266
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:19,174
Michael... um...

267
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:22,261
Yo, homie.

268
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:27,061
You and Eleanor were fighting before
and I couldn't help but overhear.

269
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:28,526
Hey.

270
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:33,026
If we hear with our ears,
why's it called "butt overhearing?"

271
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,492
Bro, if you don't like her,
you should just tell her.

272
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:41,242
It's not about whether I "like" Eleanor.

273
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:45,914
I got into philosophy to try to make sense
of a world that almost never makes sense

274
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:49,455
and that was before I learned that I died

275
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:53,258
and then un-died and then re-died...

276
00:12:53,678 --> 00:12:57,092
I just can't take one more thing.
It's too much.

277
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:59,218
I'm gonna tell you a story.

278
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:03,431
Back in Jacksonville, there was this guy
in my 80-person dance crew

279
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:04,932
named Stank Toby.

280
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:08,520
Hang on. It was a 60-person dance crew.

281
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:09,732
Um...

282
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:11,403
Oh, dip!

283
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:13,562
What are numbers?

284
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,989
You're not Jason-Janet!

285
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:19,489
You're Eleanor-Janet
pretending to be Jason-Janet!

286
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:23,413
That is so wrong and so confusing!

287
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:26,833
What was I supposed to do, man?
You wouldn't talk to me!

288
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:28,146
This seemed like the only option.

289
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,127
Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor!

290
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:33,840
- I'm Arizona shrimp horny!
- That's not what I sound like, Jason.

291
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,667
- Get out of here.
- Oh, dip.

292
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:38,299
Look, you know what?

293
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,389
Just forget it.

294
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:42,303
What am I even doing? I-I'm chasing a dude
who isn't into me

295
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:44,889
I'm making myself vulnerable for no reason.

296
00:13:44,937 --> 00:13:47,099
I don't even know who I am anymore.

297
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:49,649
Uh-oh.

298
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:52,859
- This is new.
- I'm so annoyed at myself!

299
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:54,811
God... Stupid Eleanor!

300
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,188
Stupid!

301
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:59,616
This whole thing sucks, you know?

302
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:00,887
Eleanor... you... you're not...

303
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:03,824
The one thing I never wanted to do, ever,
for any reason

304
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,411
was to follow some guy around
like a lame puppy dog.

305
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:08,562
I mean, look at me, I don't need to do that!

306
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,202
I can get any guy I want!

307
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:11,870
Eleanor, just... hang on...

308
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:13,358
What, dude? What?

309
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:14,693
What do you want?

310
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:15,717
What is going on?

311
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:17,254
OK.

312
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,470
Well...

313
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:20,678
- This is bad.
- Why are you staring at me?

314
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:22,965
Do I have a zit on my nose or something?

315
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:26,393
Your sense of self is crumbling,
and it's taking the void down with it.

316
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:27,723
Great, so...

317
00:14:27,772 --> 00:14:30,685
I don't feel like myself for two seconds
and it breaks the universe?

318
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,018
How come nothing went wrong when
Chidi freaked out about his identity

319
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,106
for three hours?

320
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:37,609
Because freaking out about everything
is my identity.

321
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:38,907
Not to brag.

322
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:40,823
I need you to hold it together.

323
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,575
Try to do something Eleanor-y.

324
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,738
Laugh at someone who falls down,
or show up to an event underdressed

325
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,533
and get mad at everyone else somehow.
I'll be right back.

326
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:55,164
I know I asked you this before, but...

327
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:58,254
No, darling, this is not where
the Mac and PC guys live.

328
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,631
Whoa! Check out this dope flat screen.

329
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:02,971
It's air-mounted!

330
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:04,590
Do you see this, Tahani?

331
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,843
This must be where Janet
stores all her information.

332
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:12,648
This screen can literally show us anything
that has ever happened!

333
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:14,607
Cartoons! Cartoons!

334
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:16,477
I think it's broken.

335
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:18,854
TV, play cartoons for Jason!

336
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:22,027
Oh, my.

337
00:15:22,076 --> 00:15:23,863
Janet has a crush on you.

338
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:27,321
I'm sorry. It's not just a crush.

339
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:32,664
I think in one of the reboots,
you and Janet were... married.

340
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,289
Whoa! Married?

341
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:35,795
Oh...

342
00:15:36,257 --> 00:15:39,170
this flat screen
must have been a wedding present.

343
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:42,294
It's all starting to make sense now.

344
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,673
Well, I've gotta run. We're having a little
"thing" in the breakroom

345
00:15:45,724 --> 00:15:47,135
for Marisol's birthday.

346
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:49,596
She's turning 39 million, again.

347
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:51,470
So, if there's nothing else...

348
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:55,103
"If there's nothing else?" Neil, be logical.

349
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:59,065
Not one Good Place resident
in over 500 years?

350
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,280
Not Jonas Salk, not Harriet Tubman?

351
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:05,112
Not one single Golden Girl?

352
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:08,279
The Bad Place has hacked your system!

353
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:10,743
No, it hasn't. How dare you!

354
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,519
Frankly,
I'm beginning to resent your tone, sir.

355
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,396
If you've got a problem,
then go to the Good Place

356
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,481
take it up with the Committee.
Now, if you'll excuse me

357
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,213
I have to get to the breakroom
because there's cake over there

358
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,966
and if I don't move quickly,
Erika will get the last corner piece!

359
00:16:22,052 --> 00:16:23,052
Good day, sir.

360
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:25,432
Oh, no, no, no. This can't be happening.

361
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:30,176
No, he was supposed to tell us what to do!
If he's not gonna fix this, who is?

362
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:32,604
You, Michael.

363
00:16:33,397 --> 00:16:35,059
It has to be you.

364
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:38,145
We keep wandering around these
different realms, expecting someone else

365
00:16:38,194 --> 00:16:40,231
to have the answer, but no one ever does.

366
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:41,979
You're the guy, Michael.

367
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:45,282
You're the only one who can fix
whatever's wrong with the afterlife.

368
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:48,402
But before we get into that,
Eleanor's identity is shattering

369
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:50,320
inside of my void, and I might blow up

370
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:53,740
so I'm gonna need you to grab a paperclip
and marbleise me, like, yesterday.

371
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:55,520
- What's gonna happen to the humans?
- No idea

372
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:57,772
but I can't take them out of my void
in the middle of this office

373
00:16:57,796 --> 00:17:00,083
and if we do nothing, everyone's gone-zo!

374
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:03,383
Marbleise me, get us somewhere safe,
and bring me back.

375
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:05,839
Right. Paperclip! I need a papercli...
Hey, Matt!

376
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:07,629
Do you have a paperclip?

377
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:09,844
What are you gonna use it for?

378
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:12,304
- Chidi? I'm scared.
- I know.

379
00:17:12,353 --> 00:17:14,891
What am I supposed to be doing right now?
I don't remember.

380
00:17:15,105 --> 00:17:17,347
I'm having a hard time... remembering...

381
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:19,442
Right.

382
00:17:20,236 --> 00:17:22,649
Memories. You need to remember who you are.

383
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:26,236
You're Eleanor Shellstrop,
from Phoenix, Arizona.

384
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,408
Your favourite meal is shrimp scampi.

385
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:30,785
You listed your emergency contact
as Britney Spears

386
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,661
as a longshot way of meeting her

387
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:36,495
and your favourite movie is that clip
of John Travolta saying "Adele Dazeem".

388
00:17:36,877 --> 00:17:41,247
You flew halfway around the world
because you wanted to be a better person

389
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:42,709
and it was very brave.

390
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,254
You're sharp and you're strong.

391
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:49,588
You make fun of me a lot, you once called me
a "human snooze button"

392
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,179
but you also showed up in my classroom
when I was drowning in despair

393
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:57,016
and canned chili,
and you basically saved my life.

394
00:17:57,147 --> 00:18:02,734
You have very high self-esteem and
a very low tolerance for men who wear sandals

395
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:07,819
and your worst nightmare is someone
saying something nice about you

396
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:10,529
to your face, but too bad,
because I need to say it

397
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:12,653
because you deserve it.

398
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,372
Because...

399
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:15,665
- Because...
- Chidi!

400
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,722
Nice work, bud.

401
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,517
Did you mean everything you said, or...

402
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:43,684
did you just say it because the world
was ending?

403
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:50,441
I really wanna play this cool,
but I'm afraid that I'm gonna ruin it

404
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:52,275
if I try to be sexy.

405
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,237
I already ruined it, um...

406
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:59,248
saying the word "sexy" is not sexy...

407
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,496
- Wait!
- Oh, Jesus!

408
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:05,715
I'm OK.

409
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:08,041
- You're sure?
- Yes. I'm OK.

410
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,751
Wait... uh-oh... ooh.

411
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,300
- What?
- They're not Janets anymore, they're...

412
00:19:12,431 --> 00:19:14,548
them, and they're not sitting well.

413
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:16,142
Incoming.

414
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:22,890
They're all here, and they're safe!

415
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:26,817
From the old scary thing.

416
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:29,229
Now there's a new scary thing.

417
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:33,116
Hi, guys! I'm Neil. Welcome to Accounting.

418
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:36,536
Now, uh... it does seem that four of you
are interdimensional fugitives

419
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:39,080
so I did go ahead and hit the alarm.
Sorry about that.

420
00:19:39,124 --> 00:19:40,706
But, uh, there is some good news.

421
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,325
- There's some cake left.
- Yes!

422
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:45,871
- Michael, what are we going to do?
- Guys, I'm so sorry.

423
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:48,623
- The Accountant was no help.
- Rude.

424
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:51,593
No one's gotten into the Good Place
in 500 years.

425
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:55,343
We have no plan. No one's coming to save us.

426
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:00,144
So...

427
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:05,223
I'm gonna do it.

428
00:20:08,737 --> 00:20:10,194
Follow me!

429
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:13,482
The corner piece! No!

430
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:20,034
You can't take the Book of Dougs.
Accountants only!

431
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:24,247
I need one of you to volunteer
to do something outrageously insane

432
00:20:24,378 --> 00:20:27,667
that will either make you cease to exist
or be really fun.

433
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:30,235
- That's most of the things I've tried!
- That's my guy! Come on, come here.

434
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:31,217
Get in the tube!

435
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:33,050
Oh, hell yeah! I love gettin' in stuff!

436
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:43,581
No way to know what happened to him,
so come on, let's go.

437
00:20:43,605 --> 00:20:44,641
Everyone else, come up.

438
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:46,983
There you go.

439
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:55,116
Ow!

440
00:20:58,787 --> 00:20:59,868
That was awesome!

441
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:01,491
Awesome! I want to go again!

442
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:05,871
Where are we?

443
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:08,665
We're in the Good Place.

444
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:12,457
No offense, dude, but you have told us
a lot of lies in the last 300 years

445
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,876
so seriously, where the fork are we?

446
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:17,555
Fork.

447
00:21:18,474 --> 00:21:19,474
Shirt.

448
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,475
Ash-hole.

449
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,890
Holy forking shirtballs...

450
00:21:25,731 --> 00:21:27,518
we're in the Good Place!
