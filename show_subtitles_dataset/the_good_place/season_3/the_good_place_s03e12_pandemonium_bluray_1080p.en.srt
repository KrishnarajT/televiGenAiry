1
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:06,172
hope our molecules don't liquefy,
and regroup from there.

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,335
Excuse me.

3
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:08,884
OK.

4
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:11,385
Now, watch your step.

5
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,171
Hey, so...

6
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:14,843
yeah, so...

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,387
- I don't wanna go in there!
- I get that.

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,431
But come here, come here.
Here are your options.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,730
Option Number one...

10
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:26,104
Cruel, but necessary.

11
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:34,618
Oh, look at this.

12
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,285
They added a tenth dimension.

13
00:00:39,374 --> 00:00:40,990
Boy, permits must've been a headache.

14
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:44,911
Looks like we're inside
a Diane Von Furstenburg pattern.

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,214
From spring 2013!

16
00:00:48,383 --> 00:00:52,673
OK, everyone, just be cool,
I know exactly what's going on.

17
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,466
We all smoked too much salvia.

18
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,424
We gotta ride this out for about two,
three minutes...

19
00:00:58,643 --> 00:01:00,930
and then we'll be back
in Pillboi's broken hot tub

20
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,103
and this will all be over.

21
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:12,525
Hey, is...
is this a good time to talk?

22
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,611
Well, there's no time like the present.

23
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,901
And here, there's neither "no time"

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,827
nor "the present!"

25
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:20,581
Go ahead.

26
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,534
So, you know how me and you used
to be married, when I was dead before?

27
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:25,955
Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:29,205
I think I'm starting to catch
feelings again, for you.

29
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:31,624
- Mm-hmm.
- And if I don't double-die...

30
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:35,962
in this IHOP, and the Judge lady
doesn't turn you into a marble...

31
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:39,607
do you want to try being
boyfriend-girlfriend?

32
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,134
I'm not a girl.

33
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:45,309
But, yes, I'd very much like to go on a date
with you somewhere, sometime.

34
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:48,482
As opposed to here, which is nowhere,
at all the times.

35
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:51,602
- Do you get it?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,070
Hi! Butthead!

37
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:58,568
You lie to my face,
disrespect my orders

38
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,488
steal the only key to Earth

39
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,790
meddle with an already
compromised timeline

40
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,665
kidnap the humans
into a Janet's void

41
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:12,297
and now demand a meeting
in the freakin' IHOP?

42
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,087
I hate this place.

43
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:17,093
I wouldn't have asked for a meet
if it weren't vitally important.

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,217
And I promise, no more rule breaking.

45
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,048
Oh yeah? Really? Cool.

46
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:25,519
Cos it kinda looks like
you stole a book from Accounting!

47
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,648
No more rule breaking, starting now.

48
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:32,727
Hello, Chidi!

49
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:34,983
That is a great look for you.

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,108
Things don't work out here with old Blondie,
you know who to call.

51
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,658
This bitch!

52
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,161
Sorry...

53
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,162
what is on me right now?

54
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:45,518
Oops! Where'd you come from, little buddy?

55
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:46,623
No, don't touch it!

56
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,785
Tahani. Do not touch the Neednoggle.

57
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:52,668
- What?
- Bad! This is all bad.

58
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,965
Ugh! Humans are such whiners.

59
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,383
Here, hot pants.
Let me take care of it for you.

60
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:59,471
Help!

61
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,431
Ah!

62
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:05,722
Ah! Everybody, you're all still standing
in the IHOP.

63
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,349
The Judge simply augmented your reality

64
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,022
to make you feel like
you're in a normal IHOP.

65
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:14,235
- Very smart.
- Don't suck up to me, you suck-up.

66
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,442
This is far better!
Instead of a slug creature

67
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,864
I have a cute little scarf...

68
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,512
- No! No!
- No, no, no! Don't touch it!

69
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:22,819
Tahani, that's still the Neednoggle.

70
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:25,409
The Judge just made it look like a scarf.

71
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,869
- Wonderful.
- Alright.

72
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:31,794
Why don't we all sit down, so I can
fill the Judge in on what we've learned?

73
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:35,502
Your Honour, I once stood in front of you
and said I thought

74
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:37,512
there was something wrong
with the points system.

75
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:42,467
I finally know what it is -
life now is so complicated

76
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:46,884
it's impossible for anyone to be
good enough for the Good Place.

77
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,221
I know you don't like to learn
too much about life on Earth

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,979
to remain impartial, but these days,
just buying a tomato

79
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:58,229
at a grocery store means that
you are unwittingly supporting

80
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:03,068
toxic pesticides, exploiting labour,
contributing to global warming...

81
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,528
Humans think that
they're making one choice

82
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:07,913
but they're actually making
dozens of choices

83
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,456
they don't even know they're making!

84
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:14,120
Your big revelation is
"life is complicated?"

85
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:18,249
That's not a revelation,
that's a divorced woman's throw pillow.

86
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,799
I mean, this guy chose this tomato.
Those are the consequences.

87
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:24,380
You don't want the consequences?

88
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:26,716
Do the research, buy another tomato.

89
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,347
- What else you got?
- Um...

90
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,353
I'll tell you what else I got.

91
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,059
Uh, I got this.

92
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:38,982
Michael?

93
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:40,444
What... what are you doing?

94
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,523
- Backpack Kid dance.
- Why?

95
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,659
I don't know, it makes people happy?
Is it helping?

96
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,410
Can I say something?

97
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:51,407
- Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote...
- Boring!

98
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:53,788
I got this.

99
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:55,638
- Wh... you...
- I wanna tell you about a guy

100
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:58,790
from my dance crew in Jacksonville
called "Big Noodle."

101
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,362
Well, we gave it our best shot, guys.
It was nice knowing you.

102
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:05,551
I used to yell at Big Noodle
cos he always showed up late to rehearsal.

103
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,678
Then one day,
the swamp under my house flooded.

104
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:12,265
I needed a place to crash,
so I slept at Big Noodle's house.

105
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:16,562
Turns out that he had to juggle three jobs
to take care of four grandparents

106
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,192
who all lived in the same bed,
just like in "Willy Wonka."

107
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:22,446
I never yelled at Big Noodle
for being late after that

108
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:25,278
cos I knew how hard it was
for him to be there.

109
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:29,157
And he definitely didn't have time
to research what tomatoes to buy

110
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:32,956
even if he wanted to -
possession of a non-fried vegetable

111
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:34,825
is a felony in Jacksonville.

112
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,786
The point is, you can't judge humans

113
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,254
cos you don't know what we go through.

114
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,547
Amazingly, Your Honour, he's right.

115
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,968
I didn't really understand people
until I went to Earth.

116
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,798
Maybe you should give it a shot.

117
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,052
If you still don't see things our way,
then we'll drop it

118
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:54,682
and you can, you know...

119
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:56,813
zappy-zappy, marble-marble.

120
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,614
Yeah, sure, I'll give it a shot.
I'll go down there.

121
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,649
See what you guys "go through"

122
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:11,741
and then, one way or another,
this is going to end.

123
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,124
Hey, do you guys know a good place
where I can get Mexican food?

124
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:16,367
Oh. Pfft!

125
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:18,414
Mexico. Duh.

126
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:21,667
Whoa.

127
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:23,374
Well, how long will she be gone?

128
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,755
No way to tell. Uh, my guess is...

129
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,586
Ohhh, brother!

130
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,013
That was rough!

131
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,263
- Right?
- Sheesh! Earth is a mess, y'all.

132
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:37,563
Woof! Also, I guess I'm "black"

133
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,353
and they do not
like black ladies down there.

134
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,853
Crap, y'all! This is bad.

135
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,273
Well, where did you go, exactly?

136
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:51,406
Tanzania, Paraguay, Vietnam, Denmark.

137
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,903
It's terrible everywhere

138
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,579
and always in a different way!

139
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:58,375
The only place I liked was Hawaii,
although I barely left the resort.

140
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:03,923
The last place I went was a Black Friday sale
at an outlet mall in Michigan.

141
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,125
- Why?
- For the deals!

142
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,880
Earth stinks, y'all.

143
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:13,558
It's hot and it's crowded...
but somehow also cold and lonely?

144
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,435
I thought it was going to be so easy
to make good decisions.

145
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:21,519
The first thing I did
was I googled "big juicy natural tomatoes"

146
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,938
which led me to a porn site

147
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,446
that was for people
with a sunburn fetish, or...?

148
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,239
I kind of never recovered.

149
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:33,698
Right. That's problem number one -
life is chaotic and messy and unpredictable.

150
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,907
Problem number two -
even if you do somehow manage

151
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:42,753
to make good decisions, you still lose points
because of the unintended consequences.

152
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,837
Yeah, there are
booby traps everywhere!

153
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:49,085
Like, there's this chicken sandwich that,
if you eat it, it means you hate gay people!

154
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,087
- And it's delicious!
- It is! It is so good.

155
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:54,966
And... and I essentially tried
to do what you suggested

156
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,093
I obsessed over every choice.

157
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,938
But that was also bad,
and I still got sent to the Bad Place!

158
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,806
So I'm problem number three.

159
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:05,150
Oh, no, you are nobody's problem,
sweetheart.

160
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,778
You know, we gotta figure this out.

161
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,695
and then Turtle makes a bet
with Rhonda Rousey

162
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,575
and if she loses, she has to bo...

163
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,613
Oh, come on! I was just in the middle
of torturing William Shakespeare

164
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:19,790
by describing the plot
to the Entourage movie.

165
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,663
- What is this?
- Some new information

166
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:24,078
has come to my attention
and I need a solution.

167
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:27,961
I want the Bad Place to weigh in on this,
but first, let's have a change of scenery.

168
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,383
Remember, guys,
we're still in the IHOP, so be careful.

169
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:34,634
Shawn.

170
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,139
I have reason to believe
that humans might be, on average

171
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:41,971
better than the points system
suggests they are.

172
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:44,352
Counterpoint - humans are terrible.

173
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:48,151
Limp Bizkit, slavery...
The prosecution rests.

174
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,108
Gotta say, that's a solid rebuttal.

175
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:52,523
Look, there are plenty of awful people

176
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:56,577
and thoughtless jerks,
and I guess Nazis, again, somehow?

177
00:08:56,913 --> 00:09:00,247
But there are also people who are really
trying to be good

178
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,123
and they aren't getting close.

179
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,499
Because they're not good at being good,
because they're bad.

180
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:10,587
The score they got on Earth is how good
or bad they are, full stop, end of story.

181
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:15,008
Then why did these four get better,
over and over again, in my Neighbourhood?

182
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,968
Why did they help each other in ways

183
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,882
they had never helped anyone on Earth?

184
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:20,847
I don't know, maybe it's a fluke.

185
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,395
Plus, you have zero proof
they did get better.

186
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,188
You didn't keep track of their points.

187
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:27,315
That's it!

188
00:09:28,027 --> 00:09:29,547
I know what we have to do...

189
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:32,066
Oh! He forgot we're still in the IHOP.

190
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,647
Anybody got eyes on Chidi?

191
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,111
Help.

192
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,325
Help!

193
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:40,196
Can someone grab my tiny boyfriend, please?

194
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,516
I'm on it.

195
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,452
And... got him! Ah.

196
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:44,793
- Here you go.
- Urgh!

197
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,835
Ah-ha!

198
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,878
I... I just saw
a trillion different realities

199
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:57,175
folding onto each other like thin sheets
of metal, forming a single blade...

200
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,385
Yeah, yeah, the Time Knife,
we've all seen it.

201
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:01,053
Let's get back on track, bud.

202
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:05,312
Yeah, OK. Sure. What I was saying,
um, before, you know...

203
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,389
I saw the "Time Knife"!

204
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,981
is this, Michael is right.

205
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:16,106
His Neighbourhood gave us the chance
to become better people

206
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,864
because it removed all the variables
that make life on Earth hard.

207
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:24,365
Yeah. Uh, there was no rent to pay,
no racism, no sexism...

208
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:28,161
No awards-show
gift-suite publicist in-fighting.

209
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,130
What?
Those gift-suites can be a real minefield.

210
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,833
But, Shawn is also right.

211
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,711
And the four of us becoming
better people could be a fluke.

212
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,263
So, let's repeat the experiment.

213
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,592
It's what Simone taught us
about data collection.

214
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:46,061
Try it again,
and see if you get the same results.

215
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:50,353
Of course! I build a new Neighbourhood,
we choose four new people

216
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:53,311
tell them they're in the Good Place,
create challenges for them

217
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,020
track their progress.

218
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:57,990
My guess is they will do
what the original four did

219
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:02,202
seek help, support each other,
make wise decisions, improve.

220
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:08,205
If they do, then it's proof that humans
are not "bad, full stop, end of story."

221
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,120
This is so stupid.

222
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:13,087
Where would you even put this Neighbourhood?

223
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:15,485
I wouldn't allow it to be built
in the Good Place, that's for sure

224
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,949
and I doubt you'd want to come back
to my neck of the woods...

225
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:21,255
Ooh! I have an idea.

226
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,848
Hi, Mindy. We need to use your backyard.

227
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,648
You need my backyard? For what?

228
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,649
We're conducting an important experi...

229
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:34,855
You know what? I don't care.

230
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,149
In fact, as soon as I started
asking the question

231
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,105
I thought to myself,
"Why are you asking this?

232
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,573
You don't care about the answer."

233
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:42,780
Do whatever you want,
just leave me out of it.

234
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,662
And if you want to talk to someone,
talk to Derek.

235
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:48,119
I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.

236
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:51,789
Who's Derek?

237
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,080
Don't think of Derek as my ex-boyfriend.

238
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,459
I made him, so he's more like my son.

239
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,448
Although, I did make him because
I was jealous of you and Tahani

240
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,759
so he's kind of my rebound booty-call.

241
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,808
So... he's your son-rebound-booty-call?

242
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:10,558
Fine, if you want to put labels on it,
I guess he's my son-rebound-booty-call.

243
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,223
But he doesn't mean anything to me.

244
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,817
Also, Derek never really...

245
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,569
worked right. He's a buffoon.

246
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,188
You have nothing to worry about.

247
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,649
"How should he love thee?

248
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,067
Or how deem thee wise?

249
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,111
Who wouldst not leave him

250
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,658
In his wandering?"

251
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,248
Oh. I didn't see you there.

252
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,668
I was just reciting some Edgar Allan Poe.

253
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,541
Hi, I'm Derek.

254
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,706
Welcome to the Medium Place.

255
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:42,507
Derek! Why are... you so different?

256
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,254
You have Mindy to thank for that.

257
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,887
See, she found a plunger sticking out
of the ground behind our house

258
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,264
and every time she hits it, I pass out.

259
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,938
When I come to, I'm a little bit smarter
and a little bit better.

260
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,060
Not to brag

261
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,229
but I almost have a full-grown penis now.

262
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,941
It's resplendent, and mostly functional.

263
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:03,190
- How many times has Mindy rebooted you?
- I don't know. Half a million?

264
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,321
- What?
- She reboots me a lot.

265
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,658
Sometimes when she's bored,
or just needs some "alone time"

266
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:10,239
sometimes just for laughs.

267
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,206
Derek... Shall we head inside?

268
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,745
- OK.
- Cool.

269
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,339
So, here are the rules.

270
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,966
Michael designs the new Neighbourhood
however he wants.

271
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,878
The Bad Place gets to choose
the four new humans

272
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:29,682
but they have to be the same general level
of badness as the original four.

273
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:33,604
Alright? No serial killers, no dictators,
no one who managed a boy band.

274
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,190
Michael will not get the files in advance

275
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:39,150
so he does not have forever to plan

276
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:43,822
but he can then change the Neighbourhood
however he wants.

277
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,996
Yeah, I have about a billion objections
to this.

278
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,527
- So do I.
- Good! That means it's a fair compromise.

279
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,905
So, one last issue.

280
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,456
Where do we get all the other residents
for this place?

281
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:58,166
Well, my original Neighbourhood was built
for torture so everyone was a demon

282
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:01,207
we can't have that.
I say we get them from the Good Place.

283
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,542
Over my dead skin-suit.

284
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,381
Well, what other option do we have?

285
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,597
Would anybody like a Medium snack?

286
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,134
I myself will be enjoying another
classy martini.

287
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,597
Don't mind if I do.

288
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,888
I can make the people.

289
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,352
- Just like I made Derek.
- Are you sure?

290
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,731
Yes. If the Judge restores my powers
in the Medium Place, I can do it.

291
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:24,487
They'll be way more advanced
than the original Derek. No offense.

292
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,573
None taken.

293
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,526
OK. The other residents will be comprised
of "Janet babies."

294
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,864
You will have one year of Earth time
to try to improve the humans.

295
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,871
I will be monitoring everything
to ensure there's no cheating

296
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,328
and to track the humans' progress. Deal?

297
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,878
Ah! Gah! Ow!

298
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,711
Classic.

299
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,754
Ha-ha! Ow!

300
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,552
- Janet?
- Hi there!

301
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,099
- Ah.
- Ready to start building?

302
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,600
- Yes.
- I have some ideas

303
00:14:58,691 --> 00:15:00,978
for how to design
a sort of "basic" Neighbourhood

304
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,985
which we can then tailor to the guests
as we learn more about them.

305
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:07,522
- Now, when you say, um... "some" ideas?
- I have 11 trillion ideas.

306
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,858
Yes. I'm so glad you're here, Janet.

307
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,030
Me too.

308
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,570
Alright. So...

309
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:16,164
What's your first "basic" idea?

310
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,583
Perfect. So "basic."

311
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,555
This house was built to torture you.

312
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,554
Why did you have Michael
recreate it exactly?

313
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,312
Well, in the memories I watched,
this was where we fell in love.

314
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,061
So I figured, why mess with success?

315
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:44,776
I mean, bleugh! What am I saying?

316
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:47,275
This house is stupid and you're lame,
and I hate you.

317
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:48,484
I love you too.

318
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,491
This is gonna be fun.

319
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,569
I mean, I know we have to help
these new people

320
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:58,498
but most of the time we'll just get
to live together, like a normal couple.

321
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,917
We can chill out, and just relax, and...

322
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,295
- Have sex...
- ... study philosophy.

323
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,794
- Horndog!
- Nerd!

324
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,766
- Hi! I'm Daphne.
- Hi, Daphne. I'm Janet.

325
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,472
- I made you.
- Great.

326
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:19,926
I'll wait for your instructions.

327
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,555
Thank you for making me!
Bye!

328
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,518
OK, Daphne's done.

329
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,942
Only another 185 people to go.

330
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,644
I'll check back in an hour.

331
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,651
You're doing so good, Janet.

332
00:16:30,783 --> 00:16:33,241
Thanks, Jason. Making people is exhausting.

333
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,318
Can't help but notice

334
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,244
you're making a bunch of people.

335
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,492
You know, if we pooled our resources

336
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,999
we could be done in two shakes
of a lamb's Derek.

337
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,411
Whatever. Janet doesn't
need your help, dude!

338
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,630
Actually, it would go a lot faster.
Thanks, Derek.

339
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,416
No problem.

340
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,793
Don't worry,
this is purely professional, OK?

341
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,845
Now be a pal and hold my classy martini,
while I get down to business.

342
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,470
Let's make people.

343
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,103
Hello, Your Honour...

344
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,560
You fell for it! It's me, Shawn.

345
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,687
Just wanted to wish you bad luck.

346
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,523
Trying to psyche me out?
You must be scared.

347
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:14,900
Oh, I'm very confident.

348
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,917
I think we've picked some excellent subjects
for your stupid experiment.

349
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,446
When you fail, and you will...

350
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:22,786
I've got something special cooked up
for your four little friends.

351
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:27,621
Let me guess, they're gonna be tortured
with penis flatteners, and bees with teeth...

352
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,172
you are so predictable.

353
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,712
Why don't you at least switch it up
once in a while?

354
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:34,382
Try using teeth flatteners

355
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,258
and bees with penises?

356
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,510
First of all, that's... stupid.

357
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,637
But also, we are switching it up.

358
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,596
When you fail, the four humans
will be tortured for all eternity.

359
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,897
But guess who's going to be doing
the torturing?

360
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,683
Hello, idiot!

361
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,777
We built a Michael suit!

362
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,770
The boys down
in R&D said it couldn't be done

363
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,231
so I made it out of them.

364
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,154
That's Vicky in there right now,
taking you for a spin.

365
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,786
You are disgusting. Dis-gus-ting-uh!

366
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,491
Oh, Michael. It's going to be so amazing,
watching your four BFFs

367
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:09,080
look so sad and betrayed and confused,
as you, their reformed demon daddy

368
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,709
unleash a swarm of...

369
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,800
penis-bees. I invented those.

370
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,178
That was me.

371
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,758
Well, I will just tell them
what you're going to do

372
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:19,589
and they'll know that it isn't really me.

373
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,929
And we'll erase their memories
of you telling them.

374
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,015
Thanks for inventing that little trick,
by the way - very useful.

375
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,189
Have fun, Michael.

376
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,892
Enjoy everything
that is about to overwhelm you.

377
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,193
Mmm-bye, bitch!

378
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,455
So... how bad is contestant number one?

379
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,953
Murderer? War criminal?

380
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,084
Instagram DJ?

381
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,335
Uh, yeah, um...

382
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,289
- Are you OK?
- Mm-hmm. Yep, just a little jittery.

383
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:57,135
Last time I designed a Neighbourhood,
things didn't really go according to plan.

384
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,719
Neh. Plans are for wimps.

385
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,926
- Mm.
- We should've done this Shellstrop-style

386
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,516
don't prepare at all,
get drunk the morning of the test

387
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:07,054
BS our way through it, and then brag
about how we didn't even study

388
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,015
and still got a C plus!

389
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,896
So what do we got, man?
I gotta go give everyone a heads-up, remember?

390
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:15,779
Uh, his name is John.
Um, some sort of journalist.

391
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,277
No major crimes or atrocities...

392
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,404
- Is he out there right now?
- Mm-hmm.

393
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,661
Wow. That's freaky.

394
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:33,292
So, based on initial skimming of his file,
we will run scenario...

395
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,585
G48-119...

396
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,087
- Geez Louise.
- Well...

397
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:38,949
you have to be prepared for anything.

398
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,972
I mean, is John coming in thinking
that he belongs

399
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,926
or does he know he definitely doesn't?

400
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,594
Dude, dude... Relax.

401
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,894
All we have to do today is tell John
he's in the Good Place

402
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:51,209
show him around the Neighbourhood,
and get him to Tahani's welcome party.

403
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:53,691
That's it. We can deal with the rest later,
right?

404
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,773
- Right. Right, right, right...
- Hey.

405
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:59,322
Listen. Whatever your plan is,
it's gonna be great.

406
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:00,864
We trust you.

407
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,952
Your friends will always trust you.

408
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,082
OK. Here I go.

409
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,454
OK. I'm gonna...

410
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,580
Yup. Here I go.

411
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,001
I go here and...

412
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,379
I'm gone.

413
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,798
- Michael?
- Oh, yeah, I'm gone...

414
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:27,179
- Oh, whoa.
- I can't do this!

415
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,468
Hello?

416
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,512
- Is anyone here?
- Michael, buddy!

417
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,764
John is awake.
We need to open the door...

418
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,892
- Mm-hmm...
- And welcome him into the afterlife?

419
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,351
Remember? The whole plan?

420
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:38,061
I do remember.

421
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,988
That's why I can't do it.
It's too... too scary.

422
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,237
Oh...

423
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:44,785
No!

424
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,444
Hello?
