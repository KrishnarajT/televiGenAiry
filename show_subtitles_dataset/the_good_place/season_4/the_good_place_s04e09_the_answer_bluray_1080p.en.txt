1
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,999
Not in this Janet.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,209
Next.

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,810
What are you waiting for? Do it.

4
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,330
It's not that easy.

5
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,640
He lived a whole life
and then 802 afterlives,

6
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,030
and a second life,
then a second afterlife,

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,040
and then a third "first" afterlife.

8
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:08,139
His psyche is like a giant
bowl of M&M Peep chili.

9
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,826
I gotta make sure all the
memories go in the right place

10
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,159
in the right order.

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,579
Maybe I just start him at the beginning,

12
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,099
a full factory reset.

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,680
Man. Janet, can I please have a drink

14
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,840
with a lot of alcohol in it?

15
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,320
Here, I saved this from my funeral.

16
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,840
It's called a Duval Ditchwater.

17
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,190
It's Midori, Coffee-Mate,
and ditch water.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,029
- I'll get you a margarita.
- Yeah, that sounds better.

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,630
It's not. Seriously, try this.

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,630
- Okay, here we go...
- Oh...

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,670
Oh!

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,450
- He has your eyes.
- And your smile.

23
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,250
- Now he just needs a name.
- Big decision.

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,670
- How about Chidi?
- Oh, I like that.

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,790
Do you like it, Chidi?

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,360
Or would you like a different name?

27
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,830
- Looks like he has a tummy ache.
- Uh-oh.

28
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,100
Chidi.

29
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,079

30
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,670
You're not listening to me.

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,350
Everything always has to be your way.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
And what is the one right way?

33
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,510
I mean, how many times
have I told you this?

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
I thought this was what you wanted.

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,550
No, it's obviously what you want.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,450
You're just angry that
your book was rejected.

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,150
Oh, how dare you bring that up again?

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,010
You're always at the university!

39
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,820
How about use show some
interest in someone

40
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,910
who didn't die 200 years ago?

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,729
I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up.

42
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,300
We need to go back to Nigeria.

43
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,530
No, we are not going. My family is here.

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,870
And we did this for your career.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,310
Good morning, Chidi.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,510
Would you like some breakfast?

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,150
I have a presentation.

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,290
- Here's a syllabus.

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,209
Take one and pass them on.

50
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,379
My lecture will take
approximately 55 minutes.

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,010
Let's begin, shall we?

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,390
In conclusion, there
is one clear answer,

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,839
and it's that the two of
you should stay married.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,360
Questions?

55
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,600
That was clear

56
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,430
and persuasive,

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,520
- and you have made a strong case.
- Yes.

58
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,930
Well argued. Better than
some of my grad students.

59
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,039
You should get ready for
school. I'll take you.

60
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,590
We'll both take you.

61
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,990
It worked?

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,060
Perfectly.

63
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,582
They're happy again, Uzo.

64
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,490
They're even talking about
getting me a puppy.

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,490
But more importantly,
I proved once and for all

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,999
that you can always find the answer.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,560
- The answer to what?
- To anything.

68
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,540
Every problem has an answer.

69
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,700
If you just read enough books
and think hard enough,

70
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,240
you can figure out the
answer to any question.

71
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,139
I know you're really smart,
but that sounds wrong.

72
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,940
Children, please take your seats.

73
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,559
Here's a perfect example.

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,970
Where to sit? What's the answer?

75
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,980
Obviously, we want to be
back by the pencil sharpener

76
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,559
but in the front I can see

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,819
the blackboard better.

78
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,279
Or by the door to get a nice breeze.

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,786
- Chidi.
- Just hang on.

80
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:00,489
Sorry.

81
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,570
Oh, no.

82
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,170
I still say Professor Lindeman

83
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,990
was a fool to abandon Chidi.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,900
He has a brilliant mind.

85
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,680
One day he will use it to solve
the world's biggest problems.

86
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,940
Is this enough cheese? I
hope this is enough cheese.

87
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,880
There's sheep, goat, and cow's milk.

88
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,080
- I can run and get more.
- Oh, no.

89
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,059
This is plenty of cheese.

90
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,020
I have to ask, has Chidi
always been so thoughtful?

91
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,590
Ever since he was a child.

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,439
I'm sure you've heard about
his first great lecture.

93
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,390
Oh, no. Not that old story again.

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,360
It's so embarrassing.

95
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,620
Oh, go ahead.

96
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,670
A long time ago,

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,739
Emeka and I were going
through a rough patch,

98
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,320
and our little Chidi,
at eight years old,

99
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,539
comes in with a one-hour lecture.

100
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,670
All about why we should stay married,

101
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,530
and all these years later,

102
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,140
here we still are.

103
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,340
- It's the reason I got into philosophy.
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,400
The biggest questions
and the biggest answers,

105
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,120
you just gotta find them.

106
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,520
I mean, I love philosophy, too,

107
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,840
but I'd argue that, say,
theoretical physics

108
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,880
presents bigger questions
than philosophy.

109
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,480
Oh...

110
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,809
Do you really think that?

111
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,689
Should I switch to physics?

112
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,140
So obviously my parents loved you.

113
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,220
I'm so glad.

114
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,770
They're great.

115
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,989
We have to break up.

116
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,280
Uh, wait. What? Why?

117
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,480
I've been feeling this
way for a while now.

118
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,400
It's just... why are we together?

119
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,980
Because it... it makes sense.

120
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,090
I mean, you like Kant. I like Kant.

121
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,289
We're not a book group.

122
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,250
I mean, but we're not not a book group.

123
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,820
Okay, if there's a problem
with our relationship,

124
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,960
there is an answer that will solve it.

125
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,640
- So, let's hit the library.
- You wanna use philosophy?

126
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,849
How about David Hume?

127
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,140
"Reason is and ought only to be

128
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,809
a slave to the passions."

129
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,479
You know, emotions, desires, feelings.

130
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,430
- Do you have any of those?
- Of course I have feelings.

131
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,989
I... I have strong
feelings for... for you

132
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,730
and... and what we have,

133
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,280
and right now, I will show you...

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,249
How Kant refuted most of
Hume's central theses.

135
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,499
- Oh, my God.
- He...

136
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,580
So, what do you think?

137
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,519
I think it's 3,600 pages.

138
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,090
I have a job, Chidi. I have a family.

139
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,769
Until I had to read this,
I had a will to live.

140
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,580
This work is an insane,
tangled web of inscrutability.

141
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,540
In the fun,

142
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,409
"grad students will analyze
this for centuries" way?

143
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,909
No, in the Unabomber way.

144
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,160
Okay, well, um, I'll write
my way out of the maze.

145
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,830
I'll re-outline the middle chapters,

146
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,249
- do more research...
- No, Chidi.

147
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,470
You can't answer every question

148
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,020
every philosopher has ever asked,

149
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,750
so what in these pages
do you care about?

150
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,990
- All of it. Equally.
- Shut up.

151
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,340
- But...
- Shut up, shut up.

152
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,500
- Should I...
- Shut up, shut up.

153
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,920
The greatest works of modern
philosophy are emotional.

154
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,650
They make an argument about
how the world is and ought to be.

155
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,109
There is a great mind at work in here,

156
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,160
but where is the heart?

157
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,930
Where are the guts?

158
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,630
I understand. I do.

159
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,289
So I'm going to go home and
compose a short paper for you,

160
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,570
arguing that I should continue
working on this longer paper.

161
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,000
Shut up!

162
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,200
Wow, tough week.

163
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,420
Sorry, pal.

164
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,219
I mean, honestly, I don't
know what hurts more;

165
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,670
my thesis meeting or Allesandra.

166
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,920
She was brilliant and... and funny.

167
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,960
I thought that maybe she was the answer.

168
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,230
Some things in life
don't have an answer.

169
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,360
Isn't that what Allesandra was saying?

170
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,100
Isn't that what your advisor said, too?

171
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,040
Isn't that what everyone who
knows you has said to you

172
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,600
at every waking moment of your life?

173
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,500
Okay, I can figure this out.
I just need to find the answer

174
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,400
for how to impress Allesandra,

175
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,000
a separate answer for how
to impress my advisor,

176
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,499
or ideally, one answer for
how to impress them both.

177
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,740
Oh, you know what this calls for.

178
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,230
- Don't say it.
- A Venn diagram.

179
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,790
No Venn diagram.

180
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,020
If you won't listen to other people,

181
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,919
do you at least hear what you're saying?

182
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,469
I swear, sometimes it
is literally impossible

183
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,479
to be your friend.

184
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,440
You're incapable of
making a single decision.

185
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,710
Look, what's the harm in
taking a few extra minutes

186
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,099
to find the perfect...

187
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,610
Chidi, come on in.

188
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,520
Unless you'd be more
comfortable out here.

189
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,720
Oh, well, I feel like you want me to...

190
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,350
I tell you what. I'll decide for you.

191
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,010
- Come on in.
- Great.

192
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,879
Watch this.

193
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
Your fridge chooses
your breakfast for you.

194
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,820
Oatmeal and almond milk.

195
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,200
Extra filmy. You don't
even have to decide.

196
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,630
It just knows what you want,

197
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,800
and for all your other requests,

198
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,599
Janet?

199
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,880
Hi there.

200
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,120
Janet knows the answers

201
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,580
to all the questions in the universe.

202
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,689
Ask her anything.

203
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,440
I mean, which answer do I want?

204
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,800
I mean, something profound, obviously.

205
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,909
It shouldn't be trivial or salacious.

206
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,329
Or maybe I should start
small and maybe ramp up.

207
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,440
Or... I can't...

208
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,700
- What's the biggest fish?
- The whale shark.

209
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,880
Cool.

210
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm sorry. I'll have
better questions later.

211
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,380
You don't need to apologize, Chidi.

212
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,780
All questions are equally
important to me.

213
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,179
Oh, well then you and I
are gonna get along great.

214
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,320
I need to go welcome
some more residents.

215
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,260
Are there any other questions
I can answer for you before I go?

216
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,899
Well, yes. Is... is there
a relationship equivalent

217
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,830
to the oatmeal?

218
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,649
Uh, is there, like, a sort of...

219
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,279
Soul mate? Yes.

220
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,770
Every person in the Good
Place has one perfect match.

221
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,000
In an hour, come on by the little house

222
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,240
that looks like a face

223
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,369
and get the answer to
your ultimate question.

224
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,292
Her name's Eleanor.

225
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,710
Oh, man. Remember this?

226
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,800
Yeah, yeah.

227
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,890
- It was eight minutes ago.
- Mm-hmm.

228
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,840
So you just proposed to
Janet, and you said yes.

229
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,890
- And now you're married.
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,920
You know, I thought saying that out loud

231
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,810
would make it less
insane, but it did not.

232
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,900
Thanks, homie.

233
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,340
If you'd like to get us a present,

234
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,529
we're registered at me.

235
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,150
Jason, I think I need your help.

236
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,440
- Can I ask you something?
- Cool.

237
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,280
No one's ever asked
me for advice before,

238
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,869
and you're a high school principal.

239
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,000
College professor.

240
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,289
Who... who told you how to do this?

241
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,379
Like, how can you just
make a decision this big?

242
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,870
Chidi, here's the thing with stuff.

243
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,150
You can look at a problem
from every angle

244
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,260
and drive yourself crazy, but sometimes,

245
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,900
you just gotta huck a
Molotov cocktail at a drone

246
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,679
and see what happens.

247
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,470
Is what happens that the drone blows up?

248
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,400
Usually. I mean, where I'm from,

249
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,970
most things blow up eventually,

250
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,220
so I learned that when
something dope comes along,

251
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,890
you gotta lock it down.

252
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,320
If you're always frozen in
fear and taking too long

253
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,740
to think about what to do,

254
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,720
you'll miss your opportunity
and maybe get sucked

255
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,654
into the propeller of a swamp boat.

256
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,390
I just... I don't think I'll ever be

257
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,539
the kind of person who just acts.

258
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,390
I mean, I can't just open
a door and walk through

259
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,220
without knowing what's
on the other side.

260
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,740
Even with eternity to try,

261
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,294
I just don't think that can happen.

262
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:51,790
Well, I never thought I'd
ever be able to get married.

263
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,120
I thought I was too old.

264
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,410
I'm infinity,

265
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,759
but strange things
happen in the afterlife.

266
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,179
We figured it out once.

267
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,219
We can do it again,

268
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,990
because you know what, Michael?

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,240
You're basic...

270
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,169
This is your soul mate, Salamasina.

271
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,229
Meet your soul mate, Guan-yin.

272
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,680
Tahani. Karen.

273
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,640
Esmerelda, you don't bring knives

274
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,069
to a friendly game night.
I mean, who does that?

275
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,510
The prepared.

276
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,970
Chidi, Esmerelda.

277
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,990
It's your turn.

278
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,540
Blood. Seas of blood.

279
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,910
Enemies.

280
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,219
Uh, 1,000 years of darkness.

281
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,750
- Uh, nightmares.
- Blood.

282
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,009
Ennui. Lamenting the
unanswerable passage of time.

283
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,760
Fire and blood!

284
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,800
You fool! It was birthday parties.

285
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,390
Birthday parties?

286
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,840
These trivialities demean me.

287
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,000
I must away and tend to my ravens.

288
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,229
Well...

289
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,330
you never know what'll
happen at game night.

290
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,850
Let's continue.

291
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,020
I think I can find you another partner.

292
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,650
Tahani. Thank you so much.

293
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,830
That ended up being
one of the best nights

294
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,910
I've had since we got here.

295
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,310
You and Eleanor made a good pair.

296
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,650
She really tore through
that round of charades.

297
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,970
Well, I'm pretty sure she
was reading the cards

298
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,419
off the reflection in my glasses,

299
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,770
but yeah, that was amazing.

300
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Um, can I ask you something?

301
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,190
- Mm-hmm.
- Tonight could have been a real disaster.

302
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,479
How do you have the
confidence to just swoop in

303
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,899
and so elegantly take charge
of a whole group of strangers?

304
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,519
Honestly, the confidence
comes from failure.

305
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,399
I've thrown my fair share
of disastrous gatherings.

306
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,630
Remind me to tell you someday

307
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,479
about Timothée Chalamet's bar mitzvah.

308
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,350
But you live through the
failure and you learn from it.

309
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,039
Yeah, I just... I can't
operate that way.

310
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,600
I can't make a decision
unless I'm sure I'm right.

311
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,504
Hey, Chidi, you're a
philosophy professor, right?

312
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:59,620
Any chance you'd wanna grab
a drink and talk about ethics?

313
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,090
It's a subject I've recently needed

314
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,600
- to learn about immediately.
- Sounds great.

315
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,429
- Uh, let me get my coat.
- Awesome.

316
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,400
By the way, I wasn't cheating before.

317
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,690
Or eavesdropping just now.

318
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,099
Whoo! When we started three months ago,

319
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,230
I never thought I'd get
so into philosophy

320
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,170
that we'd study past midnight.

321
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,980
Esmerelda must be wondering
where her soul mate is.

322
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,980
Ah, no, she's off in her aviary.

323
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,629
Sometimes I think her ravens
are her real soul mate.

324
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,250
I'm not kidding.

325
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,640
Actually, you should see her with them.

326
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,560
It's intense, and if I'm being honest,

327
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,669
sexually charged.

328
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,890
Anyways, um, this has
been fun as alway...

329
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,800
Uh, what was... why did you...

330
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,260
Who was it?

331
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,410
Okay.

332
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,339
I'll take those one at a time, I guess.

333
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,720
Um, it was a kiss,

334
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,020
I did it because I wanted to,

335
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,529
and as far as who it
was, it was me, weirdo.

336
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,190
Eleanor, I... I have a soul mate.

337
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,199
Yeah, and you're not into her at all.

338
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,820
I mean, come on.

339
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,510
There is no way you're
supposed to spend eternity

340
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,820
with a woman who sleeps in a giant nest.

341
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,290
Look, I... I know she and
I are in a rough patch,

342
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,030
but we just have to find the answer

343
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,140
for how to get out of
it, like my parents.

344
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,600
You remember that story
I told you about my parents.

345
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,980
Yeah, I don't think that story

346
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,009
is as cute as you think it is, man.

347
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,049
I mean, I'm sure you
were cute, you know?

348
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,090
Big melon head and a little neck tie.

349
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,110
But that moment, woof.

350
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,830
That's too much to put
on an eight-year-old.

351
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,290
I kinda wish cute little
Chidi just got to be a kid

352
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,120
rather than a miniature professor

353
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,029
trying to solve all
the world's problems.

354
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,290
Well, but...

355
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,770
living that way led me to philosophy,

356
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,750
and, sure, I was written
up in a medical journal

357
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,310
as the youngest person ever
with a stress-induced ulcer,

358
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,130
but I got into the Good
Place, so if you don't mind,

359
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,610
I'm gonna take a second
to think about what I owe

360
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,450
my universe-approved soul
mate and... and not just,

361
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,330
uh, make out with you.

362
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,180
Okay, man.

363
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,670
Kiss rescinded.

364
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,430
We'll just study like two platonic nerds

365
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,830
until Michael discovers me
or until Esmerelda turns me

366
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,690
into a toad with her magic amulet

367
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,390
because she can see that we're
obviously into each other.

368
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,070
Oh, sorry you got an actual human being

369
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,819
instead of your true soul mate,

370
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,569
a library cart full of damp saltines.

371
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,249
You are unbelievable!
I don't know what I did

372
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,810
to deserve you.

373
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,350
Believe it, baby. I'm all yours.

374
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,620
At least until something
better comes along.

375
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,870
For me.

376
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,669
You've pretty much topped out.

377
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,460
- You okay?
- No.

378
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,450
I have to give Michael a
new draft of my thesis

379
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,230
and I'm a mess.

380
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,630
- Will you help me?
- Woof!

381
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,490
You want my help with philosophy?

382
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,220
You must be in rough shape.

383
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,099
I mean, yes, of course.

384
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,229
I'm here for you. What do you need?

385
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,710
I need someone to help guide me,

386
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,199
morally speaking, and I
think I need it to be you.

387
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,070
There's a real possibility that
I'm in love with you again,

388
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,119
here on this plane of existence,

389
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,980
uh, today, now.

390
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,419
We found each other before,
hundreds of times.

391
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,249
We can do it again.

392
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,429
Bye, Chidi.

393
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,969
You're sure you want to do this?

394
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,150
I finally make up my mind
about one damn thing,

395
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,210
and you try to talk me out of it?

396
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,100
I'm sure.

397
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,730
Can I ask you a question?

398
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,270
Soul mates aren't real, are they?

399
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,170
Chidi, in all honesty, I don't know,

400
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,279
but I don't think so.

401
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,409
I knew what you expected
to find when you got here;

402
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,530
answers.

403
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,330
Also, if I recall from your file,

404
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,129
a magic blackboard?

405
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,990
One that anticipates your lesson flow.

406
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,049
That's the dream.

407
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,810
But mostly you wanted answers.

408
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,590
The soul mate one, in particular.

409
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,210
So, I used it to torture you,

410
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,729
which, again, sorry.

411
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,920
If soul mates do exist,
they're not found.

412
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,359
They're made.

413
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,030
People meet, they get a good feeling,

414
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,069
and then they get to work
building a relationship,

415
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,770
like your parents.

416
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,110
They didn't magically stay together

417
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,160
because you proved they should.

418
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,650
It wasn't my logic or my representation.

419
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,840
It was the feeling they
got watching me...

420
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,520
this scared little kid telling
them that he needed them.

421
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,790
It was also what you made them remember.

422
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,300
You know, they loved each other.

423
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,190
Sometimes people forget.

424
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,930
You reminded them of
what they already had.

425
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,309
It convinced them to go to counseling.

426
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,019
I never knew they went to counseling.

427
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,410
Yeah, kids are idiots.

428
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,490
If they knew half the stuff
their folks were up to,

429
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,470
they'd lose their minds.

430
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,410
Turns out life isn't a puzzle

431
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,440
that can just be solved one time

432
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,079
and... and it's done.

433
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,499
You wake up every day
and you solve it again.

434
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,710
Terribly inefficient.

435
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,169
Wow, what a time to learn.

436
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,179
Can you give me a second?

437
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,480
- Janet?
- Hi there.

438
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,300
Hi.

439
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,859
Uh, can I have, uh, a
pen and some paper?

440
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,160
I don't know if I'll see you again,

441
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,970
or what I'll remember if I do,

442
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,450
but if we do cross paths again...

443
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,510
Sometime, somewhere...

444
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,890
Can you give this back to me?

445
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,860
Of course.

446
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,229
I'm ready.

447
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,080
Hi there, Chidi.

448
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,409
Welcome back.

449
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,280
Is he all right? Did you break him?

450
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,060
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

451
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,790
Man, I'm doing great.

452
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,840
Hey, so, for the past 300 years,

453
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,210
have I been super annoying?

454
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,160
- Oh, no...
- No, no.

455
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,300
- I wouldn't say extremely.
- Not super.

456
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,929
- No, no.
- Yes.

457
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,730
Well, thank you, all of you,

458
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,040
for everything you've done for me.

459
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,099
You are wonderful people.

460
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,309
Yeah, man, that's great,
but, um, listen, we have,

461
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,910
like, one hour to create
an entirely new afterlife,

462
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,880
and, uh, also save all of humanity

463
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,909
and we were wondering if
you could do your Chidi thing

464
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,239
and, um, find us the answer?

465
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,390
Oh, well, Eleanor, this kind of thing

466
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,520
doesn't have just one answer.

467
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,619
There might be 800.

468
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,760
There could be zero.
Who knows, you know?

469
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,280
The journey is the destination, right?

470
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,250
Let's get to work. Can
you give me one second?

471
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,400
- Uh...
- One second.

472
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,339
Hey, uh, Janet, can I
have my note, please?

473
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,050
If you know that you wrote a note

474
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,710
then you know what it says.

475
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,280
I do, uh, but I'd still like
to see it again, please.

476
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,189
I think it might be some of the
best writing I've ever done.

477
