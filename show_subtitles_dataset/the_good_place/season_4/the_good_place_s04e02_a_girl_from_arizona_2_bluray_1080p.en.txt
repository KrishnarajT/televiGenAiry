1
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,220
- Linda.

2
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,110
You can have literally
anything you could possibly...

3
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,880
- What the...
- You sent a demon in disguise

4
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,399
as one of the subjects?

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,290
This outrageous act must be punished.

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,650
Chidi will be the fourth
subject in this experiment.

7
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,430
I still don't get why the Bad Place

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,289
would try something so obvious.

9
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,459
They're desperate. They
know they're gonna lose.

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,749
Plus, we can get rid of
the Linda picture...

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,669
and put a Chidi picture
on the other side

12
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,460
since we know a ton about him.

13
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,129
This is all good news,
right, Team Leader?

14
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,720
Yeah, it's super cool that
I'm actively surveilling

15
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,450
and manipulating an ex-boyfriend.

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,760
I mean, more so than I usually did.

17
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,599
Okay, let's focus on Brent.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,960
Born on third base,

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,460
thinks he invented the game of baseball.

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,080
Guys like this believe that the world

21
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,359
revolves around them
because... it kind of does.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,900
If we could get him to
listen to anyone else,

23
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,200
he'd hear how much better
they are than he was,

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,779
which might make him realize
that he doesn't belong here.

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,900
And also, bonus...

26
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,910
maybe he cries like a
stupid little baby.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,879
- Synced & corrected by MementMori -
www.addic7ed.com ...

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,459
- Anyway, long story short,

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,879
that's why there are still ducks.

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,839
- I saved all the ducks.
- Aw!

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,250
Incredible. Wow.

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,099
Thank you, Wanda. What a life.

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,679
Now we turn to our next
guest, Chidi Anagonye.

34
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,149
Now Chidi, you led an
impressive life as an academic.

35
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,600
Well, not "save an entire
species" impressive,

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,780
but, yes, I was a professor

37
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,670
of ethical and moral philosophy.

38
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,279
I'm sorry... literally every duck?

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,230
- You saved every duck?
- In essence, yes.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,950
And I didn't mention this before.

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,290
I really don't like to
brag but also... horses.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,459
- Oh!
- What?

43
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,999
Man... I mean,

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,499
compared to you, I feel
a little inadequate.

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,339
Hey, Mikey, can I ask you something?

46
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,920
I feel bad for making Janet's life

47
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,800
more chaotic and unpredictable,

48
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,389
so here's my idea to make it up to her.

49
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,630
Me and 100 Janet Babies
do a giant flash mob...

50
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,519
just total unpredictable
chaos all around her.

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,540
Great idea, right?

52
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,730
Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason.

53
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,100
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry,

54
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,360
I put a little cheat
code in the Neighborhood

55
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,680
where if I say your name five times

56
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,779
my headache goes away.

57
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,390
Do you know why I forced
you to act like a monk

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,829
in the original Neighborhood?

59
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,700
Does it have to do with
the TV show "Monk"?

60
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,930
No.

61
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,760
It's because you have no control
over your own impulses.

62
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,660
You think every problem can be solved

63
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,130
with a Molotov cocktail or
slashing somebody's tires

64
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,500
or plunging Derek.

65
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,080
So being a monk was torture for you.

66
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,140
The only way for you to repair
your relationship with Janet

67
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,940
is to give her some space.

68
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,809
Show her that you can
control your impulses.

69
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,580
So you're saying wanting to do something

70
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,940
isn't a good reason
to immediately do it?

71
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,600
Yeah.

72
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,069
Man, I wish someone had
taught me this on Earth.

73
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,410
People tried, mostly judges.

74
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,780
Hey, show time.

75
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,630
And now, Brent Norwalk,

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,999
why don't you tell us a
little bit about yourself?

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,209
Thank you very much. Thank you.

78
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,959
Sure. I'm pretty interesting.

79
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,440
I grew up in Chicago.

80
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,280
A suburb, obviously.

81
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,259
I went to Princeton University.

82
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,009
No handouts, by the way.
I earned my spot there...

83
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,339
just like my father and
his father before him.

84
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,280
I then inherited the family business,

85
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,099
and in just 18 years,

86
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,720
I grew Norwalk Materials

87
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,960
from a $90 million company...

88
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,160
to a $94 million company.

89
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,229
One second. Hey, Janet.

90
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,320
- Hi, there.
- Perrier.

91
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,800
Why don't you tell us about a time

92
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,279
when things didn't come so easy to you.

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,159
Look, I've had my share
of disappointments.

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,369
I smartly bought Netflix
stock at $38 a share,

95
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,869
but I couldn't cash it in before I died,

96
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,709
so all that money's
going to my dumb kid.

97
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,369
But you have to press on, right?

98
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,209
In the words of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

99
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,980
who I personally believe
was a great man,

100
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,970
he said that when life
knocks you on your butt,

101
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,179
you jump back up and start
throwing haymakers.

102
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,390
I'm not sure he said that.

103
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,549
No, no, he did. You're wrong.

104
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,000
For me, Eleanor,

105
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,719
it's all about taking
personal responsibility.

106
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,349
I don't know if people do that.

107
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,660
And if you ask me,

108
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,160
that's what's wrong with this country.

109
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,240
What country?

110
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,570
This was fun, Eleanor,
but I have a tee time.

111
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,399
Daddy no golfy, daddy get cranky.

112
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,980
So, Chad, duck lady, nice to meet you.

113
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,659
Thank you. Thank you all
very much. You were great.

114
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,660
A car?

115
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,440
- He got a car?
- Okay,

116
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,380
well, back to the drawing board.

117
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,660
If we want him to understand
he doesn't belong here,

118
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,280
we don't need a drawing board.

119
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,590
We need to bust him open like a pi? ata.

120
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,390
We tried that in the Bad Place.

121
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,430
The goo that comes out doesn't
taste as good as candy.

122
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,089
No, dude, metaphorically.

123
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,090
Ahh.

124
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,570
Although, there is another
Bad Place strategy

125
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,060
that might work very well here.

126
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,970
I don't know if that's the right move.

127
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,980
It's our only move.

128
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,610
And we're doing it.

129
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,979
Tomorrow.

130
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,820
What the...

131
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,550
Hey, Janet?

132
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,329
Janet!

133
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,249
Is that Perrier?

134
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,010
- Michael, Eleanor.
- Brent, I'm so sorry.

135
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,929
We don't know why all
of this is happening.

136
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,150
Well, I do.

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,019
This chaos is clearly all about me.

138
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,689
This is the universe telling
me that I don't belong here.

139
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,979
Brent, what do you mean?

140
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,029
I don't belong in the Good Place.

141
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,010
I mean, obviously there's
a place better than this.

142
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,360
I belong there.

143
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,909
In the best place.

144
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,179
Walk me through this, Brent.
I'm not sure we follow.

145
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,340
Well, I've been feeling
this way for a while now.

146
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,929
I mean, this can't be all
the Afterlife has to offer.

147
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,880
Not to the cream of the crop.

148
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,430
I mean, if this is heaven,
then where are my guys?

149
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,849
Where's Scotty and
Schultzy and Porcupine?

150
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,760
Where's White Guillermo?

151
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,319
And where is Mexican William?

152
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,680
And what about Squirtman?

153
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,030
Well, he makes a good point.

154
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,300
You know, what about Squirtman?

155
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,600
Also, frankly, my assistant Janet

156
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,910
is a little uptight.

157
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,699
I mean, she hasn't worn any of my gifts.

158
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,560
Have you been asking Janet

159
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,520
to make herself clothes
that you give back to her?

160
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,459
Yeah, you're doing the
math right there, bud.

161
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,589
Look, this chaos, which is
clearly all about me, is a sign.

162
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,200
If this is the Good Place,

163
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,430
I belong in the best place.

164
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,840
So figure it out. Get back to me, okay?

165
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,860
I'm gonna go punch a wall with my head.

166
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,010
I'll meet up with you later.

167
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,750
Michael, I'm afraid we need
to talk about Eleanor.

168
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,620
I know what you're gonna say.
She's just been really busy.

169
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,439
I'm sure she'll get around
to showering at some point.

170
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,449
No, it's not that,

171
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,160
although, it's not... not that.

172
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,989
It's possible we need a new Team Leader.

173
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,600
Oh, really?

174
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,400
We just can't help but
question her decision-making.

175
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,420
She balked at bringing
Chidi and Simone together.

176
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,100
She ignored my concerns about Linda.

177
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,500
Her plans for Brent backfired.

178
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,339
We've made precious little progress.

179
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,860
Perhaps leadership isn't her forte.

180
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,920
Yeah, I mean, Eleanor is dope,

181
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,880
but she keeps screwing everything up.

182
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,120
That's my thing,

183
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,509
and you wouldn't put me in charge.

184
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,580
Actually, that's a decent point.

185
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,680
But think about what you're saying here.

186
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,930
We have. We should at least discuss

187
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,010
pursuing a change in leadership.

188
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,810
Yeah, definitely, let's pursue it.

189
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,029
Oh, hey, Eleanor,
we were just talking about

190
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,900
maybe you shouldn't
be... Team... Leader?

191
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,890
- Saved it.
- Go ahead, guys.

192
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,909
Speak your mind.

193
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,760
It isn't personal, Eleanor.

194
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,240
When we started this experiment,

195
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,260
I calculated a 9% chance of success.

196
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,060
After your first three days on the job,

197
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,080
it's down to 7.1%.

198
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,799
So purely from a
mathematical standpoint,

199
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,790
you are kind of pooching it.

200
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,130
Very helpful feedback.

201
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,740
And if I could give you some feedback,

202
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,650
I'd say that you're all
ungrateful ash-faces

203
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,599
who can shove your fat grumps
all the way up your snork-box.

204
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,970
Which curses were those?

205
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,060
I didn't ask for this!

206
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,580
I'm only doing it because Michael,

207
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,110
who is supposed to be in charge,

208
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,939
had a nervous breakdown
the second it started.

209
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,689
But maybe you can do it better than me.

210
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,110
Tahani can be in charge
since she's so smart.

211
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,779
Or better yet, Jason.

212
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,740
Maybe all of humanity can be saved

213
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,539
with one good old-fashioned
Jacksonville carnival.

214
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,850
I mean, we could try.

215
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,490
All I need is a bouncy house,

216
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,920
some ninja stars, and a
bunch of ambulances.

217
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,129
Well, good luck, forkfaces.

218
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,790
I quit.

219
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,160
Shellstrop out.

220
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,509
You got it all out of your system?

221
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,070
You gonna come back?

222
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,349
- Get to work?
- No, man.

223
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,300
I meant what I said. I quit.

224
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,780
I'm sorry you overheard that.

225
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,100
And they're sorry they said it.

226
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,840
But you don't just get
to quit this, Eleanor.

227
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,569
This is not your 7th grade band or

228
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,569
three hours into a
two-week juice cleanse.

229
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,529
A little more at stake here.

230
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,650
Yeah, man, that's why I'm quitting.

231
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,999
The things that are happening
here are above my pay grade.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,829
How do I get Brent to stop
being such a deckhead?

233
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,810
How do I fix Simone when she's convinced

234
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,129
all of this is happening
inside of her brain?

235
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,510
Ooh, maybe I should
drive her into the arms

236
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,759
of my ex-boyfriend... that sounds fun.

237
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,679
What do I do about John the gossip king,

238
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,429
or the demon spy who
punched me in the face?

239
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,380
And how do I do it all
with a pleasant smile

240
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,769
to keep everyone's spirits up?

241
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,030
I'm not meant for this.

242
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,960
I'm not the freakin'
savior of the universe.

243
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,460
I'm just...

244
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,199
a girl from Arizona.

245
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,260
That's it.

246
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,780
I'm just a normal girl from Arizona.

247
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,030
I ate junk food.

248
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,820
I watched reality shows.

249
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,730
I sometimes left H&M
wearing more underpants

250
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,329
than I had on when I came in.

251
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,740
I did a bad job of being
in charge of my own life,

252
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,950
and now I'm supposed to be in
charge of everyone else's life?

253
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,840
I...

254
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,550
I cannot do this.

255
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,860
When I started my experiment, I thought:

256
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,000
"Four broken birdbrains who will believe

257
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,180
"everything I tell them.

258
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,640
This will be a breeze."

259
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,700
You beat me in three months.

260
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,949
Okay, fine, I thought. A fluke.

261
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,840
You then beat me 800 more times.

262
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,610
Because human beings, it turns out,

263
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,450
are weird

264
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,530
and I will never truly understand

265
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,290
what it's like to be one.

266
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,660
This is a job for a human...

267
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,630
one who's tough but also empathetic

268
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,220
and has a big heart.

269
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,939
And a world-class bullshirt detector.

270
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,269
You think you can't do this?

271
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,920
Eleanor...

272
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,740
you're the only one who can do this.

273
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,360
Like it or not...

274
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,860
the only one who can save a humanity

275
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,210
is a girl from Arizona.

276
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,340
But everything I do blows up in my face.

277
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,049
I'm like a hot, blonde Wile E. Coyote

278
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,130
That's true.

279
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,700
About you making lots of mistakes,

280
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,300
not the thing where you
sexualized a cartoon.

281
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,179
Come on, you know how this works.

282
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,760
You fail and then you
try something else.

283
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,920
And you fail again and again,
and you fail a thousand times,

284
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,860
and you keep trying because...

285
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,530
maybe the 1,001st idea might work.

286
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,420
Now, I'm gonna and try to
find our 1,001st idea.

287
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,870
I hope you'll join me.

288
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:39,250
I hope you shower first
and then join me.

289
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
back with her trademark brand

290
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,299
of B-minus leadership,
Eleanor Shellstrop.

291
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,990
We are so, so, so sorry, Eleanor.

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,190
We never should've questioned you.

293
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,190
Don't worry about it, hot stuff.

294
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,760
I was questioning me, too.
But I'm back, baby.

295
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,130
And I have a new idea for Brent.

296
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,299
Guys like him never think
they're wrong, so...

297
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,470
we're gonna tell him he's right.

298
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,390
Brent.

299
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,700
This conversation must
remain confidential.

300
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,589
- Okay.
- Obviously, you're a very smart guy.

301
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,300
- Yes.
- But we need to know

302
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,800
that we can trust you

303
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,599
with sensitive information.

304
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,730
You can.

305
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,020
I routinely buried HR complaints,

306
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,620
so, no problem.

307
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,700
Truth is, Brent,

308
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,810
you figured us out.

309
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,880
There is a Best Place.

310
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,900
I knew it. I knew it.

311
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,610
The Best Place is reserved

312
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,590
for a select upper
echelon of good people,

313
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,640
sort of like a Diamond Elite VIP Club

314
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,830
of Afterlife residents.

315
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,299
I was Diamond Elite. I swear.

316
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,510
One time I did shots with
this pilot in the lounge,

317
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,979
and the guy let me fly his helicopter.

318
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,400
We know. That's how you died.

319
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,220
- Right.
- So you'll all be evaluated,

320
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,890
and then a very small group

321
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,230
of the most morally upstanding
residents get to go.

322
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,860
Oh, I see.

323
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,770
So it's like a "good deeds" contest?

324
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,530
That's easy.

325
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm gonna crush this. Oh, and hey...

326
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,320
mum's the word, right?
Why tip off my competition?

327
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,920
Oops. Looks like you dropped your fork.

328
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,690
Let me get that for you.

329
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,690
Did you get that? The fork thing?

330
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,760
Or should I start writing these down?

331
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,810
No, you're good. We'll keep track.

332
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,890
Great. Love it.

333
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,240
Hi, Jason.

334
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,400
Janet, I'm so happy to see you.

335
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,930
I got you a box of chocolates.

336
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,140
But then I remembered you
can't eat, so I ate them.

337
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,519
And I thought it'd be a nice present

338
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,530
for me to describe them to you.

339
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,830
So... the first one was gross...

340
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,360
Jason, um, please just let me talk.

341
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,240
You know that I've been
overwhelmed with work

342
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,550
since the Neighborhood started.

343
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,679
- Yup.
- And I asked you

344
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,940
to give me some space.

345
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,440
Yup.

346
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,079
I'm so sorry to say this.

347
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,380
But I can't be in a relationship
with you right now.

348
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,260
Being with you is fun,
but it's not always easy,

349
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,480
and I'm afraid it would
endanger the experiment.

350
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,280
- It won't, though.
- Jason, it already has.

351
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,460
So why don't we just take a
break until it's all finished.

352
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,760
Also, I hate to pile on,

353
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,370
but I feel like you
have a right to know.

354
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,780
The Jacksonville Jaguars
cut Blake Bortles.

355
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,090
He's not on the team anymore.

356
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,500
I am genuinely sorry.

357
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,510
Hi, how are you?

358
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,360
Nice to see you. Enjoy your yogurt.

359
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Problem is, now he's saddled
with a bad motivation.

360
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,480
I mean, his points won't
go up if the only reason

361
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,260
he's being nice is to
make his points go up.

362
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,510
Yeah, but that was also my situation

363
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,060
when I first asked Chidi for help.

364
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,410
I only did it so you wouldn't catch me.

365
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,020
We have to hope that over time

366
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,210
Brent starts doing good
things out of habit.

367
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,340
Just like you.

368
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:01,010
Hey, I just realized something.

369
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,810
That whole "you're the only one
who can save us" speech...

370
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,480
you didn't actually have
a nervous breakdown

371
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,540
on day one, did you?

372
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,630
You faked it so that I would step up

373
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,130
and take over.

374
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,290
- Guilty.
- You tricky devil!

375
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,730
Very clever. All right.

376
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,550
Time to go help Simone and Chidi.

377
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,550
Oof, why did I come up with this idea?

378
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,000
This is gonna hurt real bad.

379
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,069
I know, I know. But I
think it's gonna work.

380
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,680
Yeah, but it's gonna suck for me.

381
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,420
You sure there's no other girl
from Arizona who can do this?

382
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,640
What about Emma Stone? She's from there.

383
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,010
She's very capable.

384
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,850
Remember her in "Zombieland"
and "La La Land"?

385
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,380
What's with all her movies
ending with "land"?

386
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,320
- You're stalling.
- Yep, heading out.

387
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,289
Jason, I'm so sorry.

388
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,210
Janet was my whole Afterlife.

389
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,270
How am I gonna get over her?

390
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,110
I used to have a breakup routine

391
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,150
when a relationship ended...

392
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,329
Champagne and Alanis Morissette.

393
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,450
Not the actual singer.
I'd just listen to her albums

394
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,969
at my friend Adele's house.

395
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,390
I guess I could do my
normal breakup routine...

396
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,380
drink a ton of Mountain Dew,

397
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,030
steal an ATV,

398
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,990
and ride it through a Panda Express.

399
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,830
But then I'd have to ask Janet

400
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,310
for the Mountain Dew and the ATV,

401
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,450
and then I'd have to see Janet,
and then I'd start crying.

402
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,080
What do I do?

403
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,600
I honestly don't know.

404
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,740
But whatever you do,

405
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,709
you'll be doing it with your friends.

406
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,340
And I didn't even get to tell you

407
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,300
about the Blake Bortles part.

408
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
So, Chidi...

409
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,500
do you remember that woman Simone

410
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,200
from the party the other night?

411
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,880
Simone...

412
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,600
the... Third Eye Blind superfan

413
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,729
who walked around cutting
off people's ponytails?

414
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,150
That's the one.

415
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,450
I need your help acclimating
her to the Neighborhood.

416
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,900
I've tried, but since she
thinks this whole thing

417
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,930
is imaginary and I'm
an authority figure,

418
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,540
I'm extra suspicious.

419
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,020
Well, what makes you think
I'd have any more luck?

420
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,610
Chidi, you and Simone...

421
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,370
are soul mates.

422
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,790
Soul mates?

423
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,439
Like our souls are... are...

424
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,730
Mates. Yes.

425
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,220
Everyone has people that
they're cosmically bound to,

426
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,830
and the system brings them
together in the Afterlife,

427
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,210
and I can say with complete certainty

428
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,770
that you and Simone are two such people.

429
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,150
I haven't told her yet.

430
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:36,450
I wouldn't have told you ordinarily,

431
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,800
but since she's gone a
little cuckoo bananas...

432
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,560
that's the official Architect term...

433
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,680
I thought it was prudent
to let you know.

434
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,100
Whoo, boy, uh...

435
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,630
I'm getting a stomach ache...

436
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,660
but a good one.

437
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,180
A happy stomach ache.

438
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,680
This is new! There are
some great writings

439
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,590
on simulated realities that
might help her adjust...

440
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
Descartes, Moravec, Zhuang Zhou.

441
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,811
I wonder if I can summon a
book from my apartment.

442
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,510
Well, good luck.

443
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,639
This is incredible!

444
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,000
I spent my whole life in pursuit

445
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,560
of fundamental truths
about the universe,

446
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,990
but I never actually...

447
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,580
fell in love with someone.

448
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,009
I know.

449
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,460
Oh, right, of course.

450
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,890
You know everything about me.

451
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,240
I do, indeed.

452
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,629
Hi, Simone.

453
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,590
Uh, Chidi.

454
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,849
From the other night.

455
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,040
Oh, wow.

456
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,000
My brain must really
like keeping you around.

457
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,939
Have a fake seat and grab a
yogurt that doesn't exist.

458
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,380
Right, um...

459
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,550
so if I understand your state of mind,

460
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,529
it's basically solipsism.

461
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,239
You think that you're the only
real thing in the universe

462
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,800
and everything else stems
from your consciousness.

463
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,160
Yes, but to be fair,

464
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,780
I only think that because
it's true and I'm right.

465
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,730
No offense, but solipsism
as a philosophy

466
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,530
is pretty juvenile,

467
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,430
especially for a person with
multiple advanced degrees.

468
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,539
It's also impossible to refute

469
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,670
because everything you see
is confirmed by your belief.

470
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,700
However...

471
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,860
Dude.

472
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,610
What? I mean, if none of this is real,

473
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,840
then it really shouldn't
matter, right? In fact...

474
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,190
- Ha. Dude!
- What?

475
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,030
It's not real! None of this matters.

476
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,379
Leave that on your nose

477
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,819
- for the rest of time.
- Fine.

478
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,880
Point sort of taken.

479
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,010
You know, in a larger sense,

480
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,260
if you go around acting
like no one else matters

481
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,720
then you end up doing things like

482
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,940
knocking over cakes

483
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,070
and pushing people into pools

484
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,290
and just generally acting like a jerk.

485
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,110
Why not treat them better
just in case they're real?

486
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,880
I mean, what do you have
to lose by treating people

487
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,600
with kindness and respect?

488
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,620
Okay, keep talking,

489
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,630
probably fake, but maybe
real, philosopher man.

490
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,229
Well, good news... Simone and
Chidi are hitting it off.

491
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,000
I mean, I wasn't getting any
use out of him as a boyfriend,

492
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,439
so why not pass him off
to someone in need?

493
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,800
Is this what donating old
bras to Goodwill feels like?

494
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,270
Must've been really hard
lying to Chidi like that.

495
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,619
That's the thing. I don't
know that it was a lie.

496
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,980
They did fall in love on
Earth, and Michael was right.

497
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,200
Chidi made a huge sacrifice for us,

498
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,959
and I had to make sure it was worth it.

499
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,480
It's arguable that you made
an even bigger sacrifice.

500
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,420
You actually have to live
with this situation.

501
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,900
Chidi just gets to go around blissfully

502
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,299
unaware of what he gave up.

503
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,800
Yeah, but we know what he gave up.

504
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,920
Dat ash.

505
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,240
Come on, bud, I know you're down,

506
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,500
but you can't leaving me hanging.

507
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,820
You're right.

508
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,060
That is the code.
