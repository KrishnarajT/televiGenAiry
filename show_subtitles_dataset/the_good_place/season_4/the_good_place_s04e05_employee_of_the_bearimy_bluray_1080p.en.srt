1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,519
rendered powerless by
a measly magnet jail.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,139
It's okay, I guess.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,724
What is the issue now? Hmm?

4
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:13,599
That's not how Michael laughs.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,669
It's more of a delighted giggle.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:17,339
She's right.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,339
You need to nail his
subtleties and mannerisms

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,151
for this to properly work as torture.

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,009
My problem with the role

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,989
is that I haven't fully figured
out Michael's motivation yet.

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,639
Like I'm inside Michael, but
I need to be inside Michael.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,659
Hmm, you know, it actually
feels more like torture

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,080
when you discuss your "acting process."

14
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,119
You don't get it.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,939
If you really want to know
Michael's motivation,

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,839
it's the same as the
rest of my friends...

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,089
loyalty, empathy, and love.

18
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,020
- Eww.
- And that's why they will prevail.

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,719
I hate to break it to you, hon.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,569
They're not gonna prevail.

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,099
No one's coming to save you!

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,352
- Oof, getting colder.
- I know!

23
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:58,187
I could feel it. You know, it was wrong.

24
00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:59,815
I'm just... I'm in my head now.

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,112
Hey, Mikey, I have a question
about our plan to save Janet.

26
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:06,759
Is there it yet?

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,531
I do have a plan, yes.

28
00:01:08,532 --> 00:01:11,325
But to be honest, I have
no idea if it will work.

29
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:12,618
Maybe Glenn could help.

30
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:16,123
Yo, Glenn, how should we rescue Janet?

31
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,200
He doesn't know.

32
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,959
Listen, Jason, old friend,

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,179
I already gave Eleanor and Tahani

34
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,719
all their afterlife memories back.

35
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,509
I haven't restored yours
for obvious reasons.

36
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,909
But I think to maximize
our chances of survival,

37
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,183
it's time that you remember
everything we've been through.

38
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:38,937
Now prepare yourself.
This might be intense.

39
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:45,340
Oh, dip!

40
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,980
Do you remember everything?

41
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:50,459
Yes, last time I was in the Bad Place,

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,279
I threw a Molotov cocktail.

43
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,701
That was sick.

44
00:01:53,702 --> 00:01:56,419
I was afraid that you'd
watch 300 years of memories

45
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,660
and that would be your takeaway.

46
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:01,369
Buddy, I did that to help
you know what not to do.

47
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,299
Impulse control is critical.

48
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,579
Fight the urge to blow stuff up,

49
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,479
even if you feel like we're in a jam.

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,499
Got it?

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,339
I mean, that's very lame,

52
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,749
but yeah. I understand.

53
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,479
Wait, can I have all my
memories back again?

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,609
I forgot most of them.

55
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,234
- Synced & corrected by MementMori -
www.addic7ed.com ...

56
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,029
Welcome, everyone.

57
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,439
Janet will be unavailable for a bit.

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,910
She's undergoing some
routine system maintenance.

59
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,269
Oh, I know what that means.

60
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,979
Eye lift. Maybe an ear tuck.

61
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,079
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm? Mm.

62
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,950
When we don't have Janet,

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,419
we like to refresh your
memories of your old lives

64
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,381
when you did things for yourselves.

65
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:50,549
We call it Earth Day.

66
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,551
And yes, we know that's
a thing on Earth,

67
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,139
but what are they gonna do?

68
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,220
Sue us?

69
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:58,759
So get ready for some
fun, lo-fi activities.

70
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,849
This group over here is gonna knit.

71
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,999
You folks are gonna do
your favorite activity...

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,059
gardening.

73
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,539
Oh, man, we better get
something better than that.

74
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,904
And you five are going to a
gorgeous remote lake house.

75
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:14,649
Swimming, water skiing, the works.

76
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,119
Suck it, gardeners!

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,899
Why do I feel like that's
not the first time

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,910
he's screamed those words?

79
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,099
Ugh. Get me down from
here, you tiny butthole.

80
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,499
Ow!

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,159
Thank you for keeping me safe

82
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,341
from my sexy bad girl sister-aunt.

83
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,319
- Eww.
- I know that I've caused you

84
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,869
a lot of trouble in the past...

85
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,439
classic Derek...

86
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,839
but from now on, I'm here to help.

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,309
I'd feel a lot more confident
if you weren't holding

88
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,270
a champagne glass full
of Scrabble letters,

89
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:45,509
but you're all we got.

90
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,059
You can keep the
neighborhood running, right?

91
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,069
Well, I wasn't technically
designed for this,

92
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,611
but to be fair,

93
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:55,072
I wasn't designed for anything.

94
00:03:55,073 --> 00:03:57,049
Okay, we're gonna get
the humans far away

95
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,744
from the center of town to
help lighten your load.

96
00:03:59,745 --> 00:04:01,163
- That would be really great.
- Okay.

97
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:02,579
- Okay.
- All right, babe,

98
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,623
it's go time. You ready?

99
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:04,899
Absolutely.

100
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,999
I feel very confident
with you in charge.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,259
In the words of my godfather,

102
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,199
acting in what can only
be described in hindsight

103
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,099
as his most problematic role,
"You da man now, dog!"

104
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,279
As always, thank you for finding

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,927
the quickest possible way to say things.

106
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:18,339
Now head off to the lake house,

107
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,879
and do your fabulous
Tahani hostess thing.

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,973
Actually, uh, now that you bring it up,

109
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:25,279
Michael and Jason are rescuing Janet,

110
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,379
and you're running things here.

111
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,190
Even Derek has an important job.

112
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,359
I'd like to be more useful.

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,779
What is it that you Americans say?

114
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,448
Uh, insert me, coachman!

115
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,325
Put me in, coach.

116
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:40,994
Babe, we need these humans

117
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:43,119
to stay happy and occupied,

118
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,929
all right? So just pump
'em full of champagne

119
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,279
and those tiny little sandwiches,

120
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,499
and keep 'em dazzled.

121
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,709
Of course, though I'd never serve

122
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,159
finger sandwiches at a lake house.

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,249
I mean, what am I? Welsh?

124
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,019
Are you? I don't know.

125
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,427
No, right?

126
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,138
Okay, we have to move quietly.

127
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,764
We can't be seen by anyone
until we get to Shawn.

128
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:05,799
It's the only way to rescue Janet.

129
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,063
Uh, Michael? I'm scared.

130
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:10,479
Me too, bud.

131
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,799
I mean, what if all this time apart

132
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,299
has changed me and Janet's relationship?

133
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,559
What if that special connection is gone?

134
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,699
Yeah.

135
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,449
I mean, for me, it's scary
that we're standing

136
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,219
in the birth place of evil

137
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,379
surrounded by billions of demons

138
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,740
who want to destroy us.

139
00:05:26,748 --> 00:05:30,126
Hmm, I guess we both have
things we're scared about.

140
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,399
Hello, all!

141
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,714
I took the liberty of preparing
a few simple snacks.

142
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:38,389
Whew, this place is nice!

143
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,799
Did anyone else see that
movie "The Lake House"

144
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,519
with Keanu and Sandy B?

145
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,723
Oh, I love a movie with gentle magic.

146
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:46,499
Give me a time-traveling mailbox

147
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,959
or a mother-daughter body switch,

148
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,299
or like, uh, Sarah
Michelle Gellar as a chef

149
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,340
and her food tastes amazing
because she cries in it?

150
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:55,359
I should've been a screenwriter.

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,069
Yeah, this'll do. I guess.

152
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,821
I got dibs on the master bedroom.

153
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:00,239
Um, Simone, where's Chidi?

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,324
He decided to just
stay at home and read.

155
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:04,076
He said swimming in lakes scares him.

156
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:07,279
To be fair, most things scare him.

157
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,249
Well, never fear,

158
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,126
you all stay and enjoy
the full-sized sandwiches.

159
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:14,753
I shall go and fetch Chidi.

160
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:17,756
Tahani is on the job.

161
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:23,012
Perv 'stache, four-eyes, bee monster.

162
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:25,306
Whoa, is that you?

163
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:27,559
- Technically, yes.

164
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,390
That's a version of me
I no longer recognize.

165
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:33,939
Behind that handsome smile
was so much cruelty,

166
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,609
so much pain inflicted on so many

167
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,236
with such a glee.

168
00:06:39,237 --> 00:06:41,405
Shameful.

169
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:45,189
What echoes of this former
self await me here?

170
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,679
I feel you.

171
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,619
It was always for me hard to
go back to my old high school.

172
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,639
So many memories.

173
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,960
Also the junkyard machine
crushed it into tiny cubes.

174
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,759
If we get out of here alive,

175
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,029
remind me to re-erase your teen years.

176
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:06,680
Come on, guys. Hurry back.

177
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:09,009
Oh, hey, Wanda.

178
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,019
- Everything okay?
- Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.

179
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,549
Come again?

180
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,563
Whoa.

181
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:17,066
Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.

182
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,734
- Derek!
- Oh, hey!

183
00:07:18,735 --> 00:07:23,369
So, uh, things are not going well.

184
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,949
- Hi, there.
- Hi, there!

185
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,779
You said you could handle this!

186
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,559
Yeah, well, it turns out
being a single father

187
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,759
to 300 kids is not that easy, Eleanor.

188
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,579
Okay, well, the four humans
are still at the lake house.

189
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,599
So we can figure this out.

190
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,059
- Oh.
- What are you doing here?

191
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,339
I came to get Chidi.
He decided to stay home.

192
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,801
Chidi's up there? Right now?

193
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,009
Oh, Chidi. There you are.

194
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,359
I'm sorry. I should've told you.

195
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,430
I decided to just stay home and read.

196
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:53,435
Swimming in lakes scares me,
and so does waterskiing.

197
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,569
We know all that, Chidi.

198
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,519
We never expected you to meet
the group at the lake house.

199
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,149
We had a special solo
activity planned for you.

200
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,238
- Really? What is it?
- Mm-hmm.

201
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:09,530
We have hidden several clues
in this apartment to a puzzle.

202
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:12,379
Ooh! I love puzzles!

203
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,399
They're so much fun, but
they're also like homework.

204
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,239
- Win-win.
- Well, this one's a doozy

205
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,259
because when you solve it,

206
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,710
you get the answer to the
truth about the universe.

207
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:23,169
Spoiler alert, I guess.

208
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,439
Hey, Tahani, you've been so helpful,

209
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,339
but everyone's back at the lake
house with no party hostess,

210
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,289
which is obviously less than ideal.

211
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,859
So go on. Get!

212
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,689
- Of course.
- Yep.

213
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,519
- Good luck, Chidi.
- Okay.

214
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,522
So what's my first clue?

215
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:39,939
You've already gotten it.

216
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:43,369
Ooh!

217
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:48,691
All right, idiots, this is our 52

218
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,619
of the 4,000-hour presentation

219
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,539
on the future of torture.

220
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,659
He's gonna be on stage for 4,000 hours?

221
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,679
- Shh.
- Here's what I think.

222
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,399
- We should throw a Molotov...
- Jason!

223
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,879
What? I didn't say cocktail.

224
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,299
I could've meant Molotov anything.

225
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,599
- You don't know.
- Just trust me. I have a plan.

226
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,969
Humans are worse than ever.
We have to innovate.

227
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,013
Sure, poking sticks work great,

228
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,682
but should those sticks
be sharper or hotter?

229
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,129
Should they, counterintuitively,

230
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,599
be less hot?

231
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,049
Let's begin with slide
number one of 7,000.

232
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,730
Nice speech. Not!

233
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:23,696
What's up, dingus?

234
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,499
Oh, no. Oh, that's not good.

235
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,492
Oh, what are you guys... oh, no!

236
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,319
Don't do that! That's not Derek!

237
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,859
Derek.

238
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,539
I'm going back to the
lake house to entertain

239
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,209
because apparently
that's all I'm good for.

240
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,211
- Okay.
- Gonna need some party supplies...

241
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:41,049
cocktail napkins with a
cute lake-related slogan.

242
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,719
Maybe they can say,
"Better lake than never."

243
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,979
I'm sorry.

244
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,843
I just got nothing left in the tank.

245
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:49,719
Derek, when you get rebooted,

246
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,931
you become more advanced, right?

247
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:51,972
- Yeah.
- Well, perhaps then

248
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:53,979
you'd be more capable of
controlling the neighborhood.

249
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,399
- Hey, yeah, yeah!
- You said you wanted

250
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,699
to make this up to us.

251
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,979
Well, now is your chance.

252
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,989
- Yes!
- Yes!

253
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,189
Derek!

254
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,983
What are you doing here,
Vicky? You're early,

255
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:04,139
and do you ever take that suit off?

256
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,919
- It smells terrible.
- It does?

257
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,939
No need to be alarmed.

258
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,429
I know this might look like Michael,

259
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,199
the traitorous slampig.

260
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,459
However, this is actually
our very own Vicky

261
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,579
wearing the latest in demon technology.

262
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,989
A custom-made lookalike skin suit.

263
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,834
Spin around for us, would you, hon?

264
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,579
As you are all aware,

265
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,129
our current system suffers
from diminishing returns.

266
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,459
Sure, the first time someone
gets butthole spiders,

267
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,799
he's miserable, but soon
the humans get used to it.

268
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,178
And worse, the spiders get bored.

269
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:32,055
- Yeah.
- These personalized skin suits

270
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:36,142
represent the dawn of a
new era: Torture 2.0.

271
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:38,229
Oh.

272
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,647
And speaking of which,

273
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:44,479
I figured DemonCon would be the
best place to surprise you

274
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,736
with my greatest invention.

275
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:48,929
Come on out, Jason!

276
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,779
I had the boys down in
R&D make a Jason suit.

277
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,989
I thought it'd be fun new
way to torture Janet.

278
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,081
Come on. Come on. Here you go.

279
00:10:58,082 --> 00:10:59,499
I didn't okay this.

280
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,839
I know, but hey, I'm Vicky.

281
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,003
I'm a total munch.

282
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:04,713
That you are. Good point.

283
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:06,039
Hmm.

284
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,259
Not bad.

285
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,759
They went a little overboard
on the cheekbones, but still.

286
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,009
Wait,

287
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,009
- who's in there?
- Glenn.

288
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,509
Makes sense. Get an
idiot to play an idiot.

289
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,359
I was beginning to wonder
where you were, Glenn.

290
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,039
I'm right here in Jason.

291
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,799
Definitely not a big bucket of goo.

292
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,779
Okay. Say, boss, what do you say

293
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,519
we put these innovative
suits of yours to work?

294
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,539
We'll go torture Good Janet,

295
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,219
and, uh, let you know how it goes.

296
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,656
- Which way is it again?
- Wait.

297
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,116
I have a better idea.

298
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:36,489
I say we torture Good Janet
right here, right now

299
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,746
live on stage.

300
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:39,259
Rufus, go get the Good Janet.

301
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:42,542
This part of your plan seems risky.

302
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,085
This was not part of my plan.

303
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,250
Oh, thank God. I thought
you had a bad plan.

304
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,639
Okay, it's easy.

305
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,659
Just hit the button.

306
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,439
You've seen Mindy do it a million times.

307
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,138
Yeah. Here we go.

308
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,879
No, no, no!

309
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,429
Don't kill me, me. Don't do it!

310
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,319
Huh.

311
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,119
Now why is that so hard?

312
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,919
I kinda... you know what?

313
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,020
I see what I gotta do.

314
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,734
Just kind of look at this...

315
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:09,559
Derek!

316
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,370
Excellent.

317
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,999
Dude, what were you thinking?

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,579
I just wanted to be useful.

319
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,739
All I ever get to do
here is throw parties,

320
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,559
which is all I ever got
to do back on Earth.

321
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,099
Now I've ruined everything.

322
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,159
No.

323
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,539
- You gave us a way out.
- So I fixed everything.

324
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,059
No, you've made things
difficult in a new way,

325
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,239
but I can make it work.

326
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,109
Well, the important thing
is, I did something.

327
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,458
Be quiet and follow my lead.

328
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,909
- Yes, ma'am.
- Chidi?

329
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,209
Come on out, bud.

330
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,046
Okay! Am I close?

331
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,359
No, there's like 4,000 clues in here.

332
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,349
You found five. I'm just
gonna skip to the end.

333
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,699
This puzzle was going to take you

334
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,680
on adventures all over the neighborhood.

335
00:12:51,682 --> 00:12:53,766
Horseback riding, hot air ballooning,

336
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,779
and I asked Tahani to be involved

337
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,979
because she did all
those things on Earth.

338
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,819
You've been in paradise for a month,

339
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,399
and you're still so reluctant
to try new activities.

340
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,419
Yeah, I know. I'm just not a
"new experience" kind of guy.

341
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,679
I mean, my comfort zone is
basically, like, that chair,

342
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,820
and honestly, the arms
are a little sharp.

343
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:18,479
I want you to believe
that you're safe here,

344
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,859
that you can trust me.

345
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,609
Do you trust me, Chidi?

346
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,869
Yes. I really do.

347
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,009
Then come with me.

348
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,629
These personalized skin suits
are a true game changer.

349
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,219
Imagine being able to torment
a human not as yourself,

350
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,179
but as their wife or ex-wife,

351
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,728
or just some mouthy broad.

352
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:42,774
They are so convincing, they
even work on a Good Janet!

353
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,549
Oh. Hey!

354
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,939
Great, more Vicky.

355
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,519
Hey, your Michael impression stinks

356
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,405
almost as much as your suit. Pfft.

357
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:53,879
Why does everyone keep saying that?

358
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,038
Welcome, Janet. We have a
special guest for you today.

359
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,834
Hi, Janet, it's me. Jason.

360
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:05,129
Your boyfriend. I really miss you.

361
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,199
I know we were in a fight before,

362
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:14,097
but I hope you've forgiven
me because I love you, girl.

363
00:14:14,098 --> 00:14:15,939
Not a girl.

364
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,199
- Well, Janet...
- Yeah?

365
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,895
How does that make you feel?

366
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,438
Terrible!

367
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,979
Adequate work, Glenn.

368
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,759
Rufus, take the Janet back to her cell.

369
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,769
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, please.

370
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,489
Uh, let us take Janet back ourselves.

371
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,899
I wanna get a little extra

372
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,615
torture time in on the way there.

373
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:36,679
I don't see why not.

374
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,081
Hello, dummies! It's me, Michael!

375
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:41,499
I'm just kidding.

376
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,969
It's me, Vicky, in a Michael suit.

377
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:47,079
What's going on here?

378
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,674
I was never told that
I had an understudy.

379
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:54,609
There you go, buddy. You're doing great.

380
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,847
Where are we going?

381
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:58,599
Um, somewhere fun. Just follow my voice.

382
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,039
Oh.

383
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,689
This is, uh, kind of fun.

384
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,939
I'm very scared, but also I like it?

385
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,559
- Hi, there.
- Hi, whoever you are.

386
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,366
Uh, don't mind us. We're
just doing a trust thing.

387
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:15,399
Hi, there.

388
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,199
What was that sound?

389
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,359
- Uh, a unicorn died.
- What?

390
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,739
No, I mean, not a unicorn.
Uh, my mistake.

391
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,210
Just a... a regular horse that
someone stabbed in the head.

392
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:28,588
What?

393
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:31,019
What in the name of Kevin
Spacey's self-made

394
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,779
Christmas Eve video message
to try to get back

395
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,419
on "House of Cards" is going on here?

396
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,553
- Michael.
- Who are you?

397
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:36,689
Who am I?

398
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,159
You had this the whole time?

399
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,639
Yeah, I wanted to explode
a bunch of demons,

400
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,979
but you told me I should wait.

401
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,352
- So I did.
- Vicky!

402
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:45,619
Why did you build a second Michael suit?

403
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,691
He didn't! No, I mean, I didn't.

404
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:50,329
Um, oh, look.

405
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,115
It can't be.

406
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,492
Yes, it's true.

407
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:00,870
It's me. The real Michael.

408
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:04,248
We know all about your plot
to sabotage our experiment.

409
00:16:04,249 --> 00:16:07,415
We know you brought Chris
in to pretend to be Linda

410
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,179
to distract us while you
planted a Bad Janet

411
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,459
to pretend to be a Good Janet.

412
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,384
No, stop clapping! This is real!

413
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:18,329
- Someone capture them.
- Rufus, I'm warning you.

414
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,431
I know we go way back.
We used to be roommates.

415
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:22,029
But if you take another step,

416
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,599
I will use this Demon Exploder on you.

417
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,809
A Demon Exploder? Come on, man.

418
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,639
At least try to make
that sound convincing.

419
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,279
Wow.

420
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,903
Touché.

421
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,904
I used to be just like all of you.

422
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:38,399
I sat right where you're sitting

423
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,259
at more than 10,000 DemonCons,

424
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,759
and I believed that we committed torture

425
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,875
as a part of the moral
balance of the universe,

426
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:48,959
but I've learned that's wrong.

427
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,159
Humans are capable of self-improvement,

428
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,580
and so are we.

429
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,300
And down deep, Shawn
knows this is true too.

430
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,601
I beg you.

431
00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:00,639
Open your eyes to the truth.

432
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,309
Bravo, Michael. What a monologue.

433
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,429
Not!

434
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,809
I'm not scared of you

435
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,199
because I've gone there, Michael.

436
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,729
I've become you.

437
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,819
You may act like you've changed,

438
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,489
but deep down, you're still a demon.

439
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,239
Vile, ugly,

440
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,788
capable of so much darkness.

441
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:29,166
And now you're home.

442
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,669
Oh, come on!

443
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,089
Let's go. Come on.

444
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,269
- Let's go!
- No, you morons!

445
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,939
Stop applauding them!
They're getting away!

446
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,059
I swear, the production
value at DemonCon

447
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,293
gets better every year.

448
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:47,764
Man, look at this house,
and that beautiful lake.

449
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,520
I can't believe I
almost missed all this.

450
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,781
Is this the answer to the
truth about the universe?

451
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,759
- Well...
- Uh, part of it.

452
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,539
Ooh!

453
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,339
The puzzle continues!

454
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,949
Hey, you decided to come after all.

455
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,623
I did.

456
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,099
Thanks to Eleanor and Tahani.

457
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,289
Aw, you two are the best.

458
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,759
That was insane, but we
got through it together.

459
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,419
No, we didn't.

460
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,059
You got through it.

461
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,514
I almost ruined it a hundred times.

462
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:21,179
From now on, I'm just gonna
stick to throwing parties

463
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,869
'cause it's the only thing I'm good at.

464
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,879
- Hey!
- What?

465
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,839
When I said throw a party,
I didn't mean a pity party.

466
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,987
This isn't a pity party.
I'm genuinely sad.

467
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,819
The only thing I can do is
throw pointless parties.

468
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,299
You run the entire neighborhood.

469
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,529
You're so capable.

470
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,139
I have seen you get stuck in
any manner of crazy situation,

471
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,899
and you always figure a way out.

472
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,789
Yeah, man, because I have had to scrape

473
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,179
and claw my way through life,

474
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,599
and you grew up in a castle

475
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,619
full of diamond lamps and
golden pillow cases.

476
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,590
You never learned how
to think on your feet.

477
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,579
Look, if the roles were reversed

478
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,479
and I had to throw a fancy
party to save all of humanity,

479
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,959
I promise we'd be screwed

480
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,759
because I wouldn't know what salad fork

481
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,021
to put next to the... whatever spoon.

482
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,589
The Whatever Spoon is really only used

483
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,234
for certain festive jellies.

484
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,299
See?

485
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,699
Babe, the dodos in that house

486
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,239
are literally the four most
important human beings

487
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,829
in the universe.

488
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,534
I wanted you to take care of
them because I trust you.

489
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,339
Plus, your parties aren't pointless.

490
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,417
They're opportunities for them
to bond and form friendships.

491
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,339
You know, the thing we need them to do

492
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,959
so we're not all tortured forever?

493
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,279
You're right, and thank you.

494
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,059
But if we ever get through this,

495
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,959
I want to learn how to
do something meaningful.

496
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,099
A real skill.

497
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,519
Something helpful and fulfilling.

498
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,729
Okay, man, if we survive this,

499
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,999
I promise I will support you

500
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,399
while you learn to weld or whatever.

501
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,929
Deal?

502
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,780
Deal.

503
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,639
That ought to stop them
from following us.

504
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,939
So smart.

505
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,749
Nice to have you back, Janet.

506
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,127
It must've been hard for
you to go back there.

507
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,079
It was.

508
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,199
I don't like thinking
about who I used to be.

509
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,089
Listen, Michael, it's okay
to feel or plead guilty

510
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,181
about bad things you used to do,

511
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,539
but you don't have to feel
shame about who you were

512
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,019
because you are not a demon anymore.

513
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,855
You're just like a nice
weird happy old dude.

514
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,941
Ah.

515
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,079
Thanks for rescuing me.

516
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,649
I missed you so much.

517
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,779
I missed you too.

518
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,444
Bad Janet was so mean to me.

519
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:41,819
She told me so many lies.

520
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,379
Like she said the Jags
cut Blake Bortles.

521
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,578
Can you believe that?

522
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,719
Oh, no. Jason, that wasn't a lie.

523
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,059
Blake Bortles was cut by the Jaguars.

524
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,589
What? How? Why?

525
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,959
Who's their QB now?

526
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,319
- A man named Nick Foles.
- Nick Foles?

527
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,620
Are you kidding me?

528
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,859
He won a Super Bowl!

529
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,799
We're gonna be unstoppable!

530
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,472
Foles!

531
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:09,389
- Foles!
- Foles!

532
