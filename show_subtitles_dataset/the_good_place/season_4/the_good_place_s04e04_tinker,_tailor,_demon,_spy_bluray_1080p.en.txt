1
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,750
- 30 seconds left.
- Come on.

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,100
Oh, oh, it's a butterfly!

3
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,190
Oh, it's Mariah Carey's lower
back butterfly tattoo.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Yes!

5
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,600
Well done, John.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,670
And because you guessed correctly,

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,080
watch what happens.

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,240
Oh.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,950
Oh!

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,589
I should've gotten that sooner.

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,799
I wrote my college thesis
on that back tattoo.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,140
Yes, because remember,
every picture from tonight

13
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,250
will have something to do
with your lives on Earth,

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,050
so you can get to know each
other a little bit better.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,309
Okay, Blue Team, you're up.

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,769
Go get 'em, chippy.

17
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,090
Chidi, it's your turn.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,260
Oh. I'm a pretty decent artist,

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,729
but I'm not so great under pressure.

20
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,439
Your time begins now.

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,489
Ooh, boy. Okay.

22
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,070
- You got this, Chidi.
- I'm sorry.

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,340
I'm just trying to
figure out how to start.

24
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,700
Come on. Just start drawing, my brotha.

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,300
Oh, no.

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,270
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,329
No.

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,459
- 30 seconds!
- Ah! Okay, here we go.

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,419
Uh... oh.

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,580
Uh, it's a submarine.

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,959
Looks like broccoli with teeth.

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,920
Oh, oh, it's a horse
with a bow on its neck.

33
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,719
Oh, is it my childhood pony, Daisy?

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,790
Yes!

35
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,219
Oh, no.

36
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,969
No!

37
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,479
What have I done?

38
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,899
You made a freakin' Frankenstein, man.

39
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,130
Okay, okay, okay. You know what?

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,900
Magic Pictionary is over now,

41
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,300
so let's all go home and get some sleep.

42
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,110
You guys want me to kill it?
I've shot a lot of race horses.

43
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,580
Okay.

44
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,690
- Synced & corrected by MementMori -
www.addic7ed.com ...

45
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,669
Fork me. That was a disaster.

46
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,379
How did that go so wrong?

47
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,940
Well, for one thing,
Brent got super wasted.

48
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,980
We should've cut him off.

49
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,660
Nobody gets cut off in the Good Place.

50
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,759
If he asks for beer, I give him a beer.

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm just glad he stopped asking me

52
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,440
to go to dinner so we
could discuss my career.

53
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,560
Man, we haven't done a
successful activity

54
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,470
in, like, three weeks. We're ice cold.

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,769
Guys, give yourself a break.
They're getting better.

56
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,260
Brent stopped saying
"daddy like" all the time.

57
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,279
That's something.

58
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,769
Something feels off.

59
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,180
All right, we need new ideas.

60
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,680
I say we hole up here for an all-night

61
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,489
- brainstorming session.
- Now just hang on.

62
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,200
We're working really hard,

63
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,300
and we need to relax occasionally,

64
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,909
or we're gonna just burn out.

65
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,290
So let's just, you know,

66
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,749
clear our brain, watch
a movie, or... oh!

67
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,500
We'll have a slumber party.

68
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,959
What the fork?

69
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,390
Whoever you are, show yourself.

70
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,020
Oh. Hold on.

71
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,940
The hood is caught in my glasses.

72
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,490
Hi.

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,069
I'm Glenn from the Bad Place.

74
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,160
What are you doing here?

75
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,819
Yeah, what do you want, creep?

76
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,190
No one knows I'm here,

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,490
and I have some important information.

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,619
Eleanor, I need to speak with you alone.

79
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,060
Whatever you need to say to me,

80
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,240
you can say right here.

81
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,830
I don't think I should.

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,240
It would lead to a very
uncomfortable social situation.

83
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,770
Say it.

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,419
That's not Michael.

85
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,330
That's Vicky the Demon
in a Michael suit.

86
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,220
And she's sabotaging your experiment.

87
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,700
You see? It's uncomfortable.

88
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,940
All right, just sit there quietly

89
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,350
until we sort all this out.

90
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,690
If it's not too much trouble,

91
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,859
could I get a hot glass of pig urine?

92
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,530
We need to talk.

93
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,960
Or... I'm not picky.

94
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,989
Whatever urine you have is fine.

95
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,370
Eleanor, you have to believe me.

96
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,409
I'm Michael. He's lying.

97
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,270
Calm down, dude.

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,820
I trust you.

99
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,159
But I'm gonna make Glenn
think I don't trust you.

100
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,740
Somehow this has to be related

101
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,640
to the problems we've been having here.

102
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,280
And we need to figure out
what game they're playing.

103
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,560
Ooh, that's good.

104
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,459
I like the way you think, Shellstrop.

105
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,589
I mean,

106
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,170
I hate the way you think, Shellstrop!

107
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,390
Is he buying it?

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,470
He's not looking.

109
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,179
I'll tell you whatever you want to know,

110
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,480
but shouldn't we call The Judge?

111
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,490
We're not calling anyone

112
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,640
until we figure some things out.

113
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,460
- We have questions.
- Yeah, for example,

114
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,810
if you're a devil, how come
you're not wearing Prada?

115
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,979
Caramel!

116
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,340
Why would you help us?

117
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,440
One day, you're flattening penises,

118
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,699
and the next, you just decide to defect?

119
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,340
Actually, one of my jobs was
to reinflate the penises

120
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,720
so they could get flattened again.

121
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,739
It doesn't matter.

122
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,789
Listen, I loved torturing humans

123
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,780
because I thought they deserved it.

124
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,100
They said everyone in the Bad Place

125
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,540
was evil and beyond repair.

126
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,900
I don't know if I believe that anymore.

127
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,839
Also, Shawn is so mean, you guys.

128
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,509
He yells at me all the time.

129
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,179
It's, like, unnecessary.

130
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,009
I feel you, dog. I was
yelled at my whole life.

131
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,290
People were always like,

132
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,510
"You didn't pay for that!"
"How do you plead?"

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,060
"He's flatlining!"Clear!"

134
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,260
Okay, well, if that's Vicky,

135
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,399
what's the Bad Place's plan?

136
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,779
To sow chaos... turn you
guys against each other,

137
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,900
ruin the experiment.

138
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,739
Also, I have proof that's not Michael.

139
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,909
Here are pictures of Vicky
wearing the Michael suit.

140
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,739
This doesn't prove anything.

141
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,190
These could just be pictures

142
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,990
- of the real Michael.
- They're real.

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,999
I know because I helped make the suit.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,460
I couldn't figure out how to make it

145
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,280
contain your demon essence,

146
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,700
so you'll have to wear
it over the Vicky suit.

147
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,700
Ugh, really? You're the worst, Glenn.

148
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,629
Let's do it. Zip her up.

149
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,570
Okay, but if I melt,

150
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,350
I am gonna be, like, so annoyed.

151
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,350
Huh. Pretty well-made.

152
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,680
I can really feel all the
musty skin folds, and...

153
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,529
and the dangly bits.

154
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,050
The voice is perfect.

155
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,949
You sound so much like
him, I want to punch you.

156
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,560
Are we sure it's okay that we made this?

157
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,619
I mean, what are you gonna use it for?

158
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,659
What are you gonna
use it... shut up, Glenn.

159
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,400
The experiment is about to begin.

160
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,590
Let's call the real Michael
and send him spiraling

161
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,120
down the toilet bowl like
the pinched turd he is.

162
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,709
Well, now, we know you're lying

163
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,910
because Michael would've
definitely told us

164
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,620
if the Bad Place had
called him and showed him

165
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,839
some freakin' Michael suit.

166
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,589
Absolutely. Of course I would've.

167
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,380
I mean, Janet would have phone records.

168
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,759
You could just ask her to pull them up.

169
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,100
Okay, fine. I lied.

170
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,889
- They called me.
- What?

171
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,309
I lied about that. And I'm sorry.

172
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,760
You knew about this?

173
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,340
Yes, yes, but there's...
there's a good explanation.

174
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,680
Yeah, the explanation is that's Vicky,

175
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,189
and she's lying to you about everything.

176
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,449
Call The Judge and we'll
settle this once and for all.

177
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,869
Or is that exactly what
you wanted us to do?

178
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,699
That is what I want you to do.

179
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,400
Exactly.

180
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,869
Eleanor, perhaps we
should call The Judge.

181
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,380
Glenn was telling the truth.

182
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,080
No, The Judge said if
anything else went wrong,

183
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,629
she would reset the whole experiment.

184
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,160
We are not calling her unless
we have no other choice,

185
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,990
and I am locking you two
jamokes in separate rooms

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,679
until we get to the bottom of this.

187
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,420
Ugh!

188
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,219
I'm very upset about this development.

189
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,050
I'm serious, man. This is happening.

190
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,160
Oh.

191
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,470
I'm very upset about this development.

192
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,789
All right, buttheads, what do we do?

193
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,159
I say we trust Michael. He's our friend.

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,300
Wait, might be our friend,

195
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,830
or he might be a lying trickster

196
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,480
who just looks like our friend...

197
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,580
the classic Mary-Kate Olsen.

198
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,600
I have to say,

199
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,340
we've had a lot of misfires recently,

200
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,040
and Michael has been
acting suspiciously.

201
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,380
Like tonight, when I wanted to work,

202
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,549
and he just wanted to have
a slumber party instead?

203
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,639
To be fair to Mike,
slumber parties rule.

204
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,550
And why would we trust Glenn?

205
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,340
- He's a demon.
- So is Michael.

206
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,059
- Demons can be good.
- Right.

207
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,520
Okay. So it's decided.

208
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,609
We trust both of them.

209
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,990
Okay.

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,529
Predictably, this was unhelpful.

211
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,990
Get in there.

212
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,769
What is all this stuff?

213
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,359
Are these weapons?

214
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,649
Ooh, don't touch those.

215
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,330
Those are my special magnet handcuffs.

216
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,630
They make me feel silly when Mindy and I

217
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,600
are playing Upstairs-downstairs Derek.

218
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,350
Oh, they're sex toys.

219
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,730
Ugh, they're sex toys.

220
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,869
Dude, get out of here.
We have enough problems.

221
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,010
My good man, allow me
to bury the hatchet.

222
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,910
Being rebooted again has evolved me

223
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,790
past any feelings of jealousy.

224
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,240
Oh, I know that sound.

225
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,089
Looks like someone found my sex diaper.

226
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,969
I'll leave you guys alone
to live that dipe life.

227
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,340
- Ugh.
- Eugh!

228
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,550
Okay, explain yourself...

229
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,060
if yourself even is yourself.

230
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,790
I am Michael.

231
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,960
Shawn did call me, and
I saw the Michael suit.

232
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,940
He said if the experiment failed,

233
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,930
he was gonna use it to make you
think I was torturing you.

234
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,369
Why didn't you tell us?

235
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,830
Because he said he would
just erase your memories

236
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,290
of me telling you, so it
wouldn't matter anyway.

237
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,209
He thought that I would
crumble under the pressure.

238
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,790
But a month ago, you told
me you only pretended

239
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,920
to freak out in order to get me
to step up and become a leader.

240
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,589
Yes, that also was a lie,

241
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,760
but it was an inspirational one.

242
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,410
Like, "So great running into you.

243
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,990
We should get coffee some time,"

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,030
or all of Instagram.

245
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,500
So to recap, you found out the Bad Place

246
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,250
made a Michael suit, freaked out,

247
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,570
didn't tell us why, and then later,

248
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,710
you lied to me about
why you freaked out?

249
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,410
And then you lied again
just a few minutes ago

250
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,489
when you said that you never
got a call from Shawn.

251
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,250
Yes, but that lie was only to
cover my two earlier lies.

252
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,499
I mean, that's gotta be okay, right?

253
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
What?

254
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,039
Eleanor, don't you see
what they're doing?

255
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,110
Shawn sent Glenn to undermine
our trust in each other

256
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,129
so you'll call The Judge and
restart the experiment.

257
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,990
Well, I have no reason
not to believe you,

258
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
other than the three
very recent examples

259
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,089
we just laid out.

260
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,430
Huddle. Now.

261
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,140
Oh, hey, sorry.

262
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,729
I just needed to grab this.
You know, it's chime time.

263
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,540
There's gotta be a way to figure out

264
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,069
if that's the real Michael.

265
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,270
Is there a way you can make some sort of

266
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,980
demon lie detector?

267
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,270
Oof. I don't know.

268
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,250
The Janet babies are still draining me,

269
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,160
and I just had to put down
Daisy the horse blob,

270
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,270
which was exhausting...
emotionally and physically.

271
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,289
She fought back.
I won't get into details.

272
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,789
I had to twist her head off. Sorry.

273
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,530
No more details.

274
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,549
She did thrash. She thrashed.

275
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,700
- Sorry.
- Okay,

276
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,110
why don't we just get him
drunk so he starts blabbing?

277
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,719
I mean, what goes best with pig urine?

278
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,910
- Coconut rum.
- That won't work on a demon.

279
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,469
I'll try and make a lie detector.

280
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,910
Oh, no. Damn it.

281
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,389
What's going on in there?

282
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,390
I touched the dang diaper.

283
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,470
Get back in that room.

284
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,939
So Michael saw the suit. Big deal.

285
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,779
I still think you're forking with us.

286
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,990
I think this is just like when
the Bad Place sent us Linda,

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,600
who turned out to be some
super-jacked punching guy,

288
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,829
and just like him, you got busted.

289
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,670
That's the thing. The
puncher didn't get busted.

290
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,860
It worked exactly as planned.

291
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,870
The whole thing was a diversion

292
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,419
to get real Michael out,

293
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,589
and sneak the imposter in on a train.

294
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,209
It must've happened during the handoff.

295
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,180
While Janet was handcuffing Chris,

296
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,650
a bunch of demons must've
grabbed Michael,

297
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,549
yanked him away, and then Vicky,

298
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,820
in the Michael suit, walked back out.

299
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,390
You never would've known the difference.

300
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,050
Also, when Chris got back,

301
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,979
I saw Shawn and him celebrating.

302
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,990
Why would they be happy

303
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,790
if he wasn't supposed to get caught?

304
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,979
Man, I love a good sabotage.

305
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,730
Or is that exactly what
you want us to think?

306
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,850
Motherforker.

307
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,170
I knew there was something
weird about that puncher.

308
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,070
I said that to Michael...

309
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,579
and he dismissed it.

310
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,039
Yeah. See what I mean?

311
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,320
Don't go anywhere. Come on.

312
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,090
If Michael is just Vicky
in a Michael suit,

313
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,459
let's just take the suit off.

314
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,180
Yeah. Maybe we could
sneak up behind him,

315
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,750
and try and pants him from forehead.

316
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
That won't work.

317
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,570
A demon can take his own skin suit off,

318
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,710
but no one else can.

319
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,000
It's like a very complicated bra.

320
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,590
Well, so be it.

321
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,190
Take off your skin suit.

322
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,269
- I can't.
- Sure, you can.

323
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,150
You're either a demon
wearing a Michael suit,

324
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,610
or you're a demon wearing a Vicky suit

325
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,650
who's wearing a Michael suit over that.

326
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,239
Just take off your Michael suit,

327
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,579
and show us what you're working with.

328
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,990
I'm sorry. I won't.

329
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,950
- That's very suspicious.
- I know, but I'm not Vicky.

330
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,370
I just don't want to show
you what's underneath here.

331
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,670
I've seen a lot of weird
hogs in my life, dude.

332
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,300
- Get over yourself.
- That's not it.

333
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,800
I'm a fire squid.

334
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,219
Dope.

335
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,770
No.

336
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,690
Not dope.

337
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,300
I'm a 6,000-foot tall fire squid.

338
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,710
I have tentacles.

339
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,680
There's teeth everywhere.

340
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,710
I'm on fire, and my neck is long.

341
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,310
And there's a smell,

342
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,950
and lots of juice.

343
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,069
There's so much juice, El.

344
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,710
I think I speak for
everyone here when I say

345
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,470
I really have to see this.

346
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,390
So you're not gonna take
off your demon Spanx

347
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,770
because you're shy?

348
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,700
Well, that's convenient.

349
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,990
Eleanor, if I take off this suit,

350
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,430
I will crash through the roof

351
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,710
and the entire Neighborhood will see me

352
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,929
and the experiment will be blown.

353
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,719
But it's more than that.

354
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,340
You guys will never look
at me the same way again.

355
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,150
I won't just be Michael.

356
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,070
I'll be...

357
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,020
some disgusting mass
of burning tentacles.

358
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,290
Do you really want to be friends
with something like that?

359
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,770
Yes. I keep saying.

360
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,779
Eleanor.

361
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,490
Now I don't know if this will
work, but theoretically,

362
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,200
if you point it at a
demon and he's lying,

363
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,440
it'll turn red.

364
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,300
If he's telling the
truth, it'll turn green.

365
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,039
Okay. Glenn.

366
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,839
This is a lie detector.

367
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,509
Let us show you how it works.

368
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,719
What's your name?

369
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,690
Well, everyone calls me Glenn,

370
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,390
but the name on my demon
certificate is actually

371
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,720
Snakes Pour Forth From His Anu...

372
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,170
Glenn blew up. Glenn blew up.

373
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,820
Or is that exactly what
he wants us to think?

374
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,870
So does blowing up mean

375
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,470
he was telling the truth or lying?

376
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,449
Neither. That was not
supposed to happen.

377
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,010
I've never killed anybody before.

378
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,409
No, don't worry. Demons can't die.

379
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,810
He'll slowly reform himself
over a few months,

380
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,999
passing through all the
stages of demon growth...

381
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,490
larva, slug monster, spooky little girl,

382
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,639
teenage boy, giant ball of tongues,

383
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,389
social media CEO, and
then finally demon, so...

384
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,179
Look at the bright side.
This worked out perfectly.

385
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,070
I mean, not for Glenn, obviously,

386
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,830
but for us.

387
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,350
Lying demon's gone.

388
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,939
We're still here. All good.

389
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,070
No.

390
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,149
We're not all good, man.

391
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,449
You're either Michael and you lied,

392
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,159
or you're Vicky in a Michael suit.

393
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,159
Okay, I'm gonna go for a walk.

394
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,079
Nobody go anywhere.

395
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,090
- Chidi?
- Hey.

396
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,800
Hey, I didn't think
anyone would still be up.

397
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,879
Are you okay?

398
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,410
Yeah, yeah, I'm just

399
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,590
practicing drawing viable horses...

400
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,320
ones that aren't crimes,

401
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,130
you know, against nature.

402
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,310
Okay, I know this mood of yours

403
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,460
from reading your file and whatnot.

404
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,280
Why don't you take a break,
and we'll get some food in you?

405
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,449
Well, I'm done.

406
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,279
I scooped it all up into one
steaming pile of Glenn.

407
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,890
Maybe I can put him back together.

408
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,490
I'm hella good at puzzles.

409
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,510
I finished this word search
in, like, 30 seconds.

410
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,829
Jason, I feel terrible.

411
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,510
I know he was a demon and
he may have lied to us,

412
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,919
but he didn't deserve that.

413
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,509
You were only trying to help us.

414
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,350
Look, I know this is a weird time,

415
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
but if you ever want to talk,

416
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,929
just know that I'm here for you, girl.

417
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,160
Thanks, Jason.

418
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,349
That means a lot.

419
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,600
Mmm. I gotta say.

420
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,270
Out of all the human stuff
I've been able to experience

421
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,850
in this neighborhood,
nachos... number one.

422
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
- Easy.
- Really?

423
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,250
Yeah.

424
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,950
I mean, salty, crunchy,

425
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,200
cheesy, little bit of a kick?

426
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,579
Name one better thing
humans have created.

427
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,709
The Sistine Chapel?

428
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,419
Pfft. Paint on a ceiling.

429
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,459
I mean, it's fine, but can
you eat it at the movies?

430
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,810
Touché.

431
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,260
Listen, don't stay up all
night drawing horses.

432
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,799
It's really fine.

433
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,240
I know. I just...

434
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,639
feel like I made the world
a little bit worse,

435
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,309
and I won't be okay until
I make it better again.

436
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,090
Making yourself miserable

437
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,310
to ease the suffering of others...

438
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,650
about the most Chidi thing you can do.

439
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,320
I'll see you later.

440
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,520
Do you want to take the
rest of the those nachos?

441
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,990
Yeah, I do. Thank you.

442
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,070
Okay, here's where I'm at.

443
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,539
I just don't know if I
can ever trust you.

444
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,330
I'm gonna call The Judge.
We'll start over.

445
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,490
We won't have Chidi in the mix,

446
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,009
but he'll be on our side again,
which is almost as good.

447
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,549
But we know the humans now.

448
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,750
Starting over sounds exhausting.

449
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,710
I know, but if that's not Michael,

450
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,380
he could sabotage us in ways
we can't even perceive,

451
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,280
and even if it is,
I can't fully trust him,

452
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,690
so every time something goes wrong,

453
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,040
a little part of me is gonna wonder.

454
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,189
We have to start over.

455
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,010
I have a better idea.

456
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,440
I'm gonna blow myself up.

457
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,659
- What?
- I'll blow myself up.

458
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,869
That way, you can
continue the experiment

459
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,400
with Chidi as one of the people,

460
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,539
which is our best chance
to ever be successful.

461
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,200
Why not just lock you in a room

462
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,249
or in Janet's void or something?

463
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,370
But then you might
worry that I'd escape.

464
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,499
I blow myself up, I'm out
of your hair for good.

465
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,870
Well, parts of me will
be in your actual hair,

466
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,010
- but you get it.
- Michael, wait.

467
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,680
Tahani, this is the only way.

468
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,580
There's literally noting I can say

469
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,599
that will make you realize
that I'm really me.

470
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,439
Oh, boy. This is gonna suck.

471
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,269
Hopefully, I will see you all
in a few months. Good luck.

472
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,330
Oh, and make sure that you, uh,

473
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,530
get all of me into the container,

474
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,470
or I might come back way shorter.

475
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,159
And that would bum me out.

476
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,730
I wish I were saying this in
different circumstances but...

477
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,820
Take it sleazy.

478
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,990
Michael, wait!

479
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,885
Oh, crud nuts.

480
00:18:45,886 --> 00:18:48,594
Jason, how did you know
that was bad Janet?

481
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,570
Michael said there's
nothing he could say

482
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,920
that would make you
realize he's really him,

483
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,050
but Janet does have a thing she can say

484
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,139
that does make me realize
she is really not her.

485
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,430
What?

486
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,740
I called Janet "girl,"

487
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,229
but she didn't say, "Not a girl."

488
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,140
The real Janet always says,

489
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,740
"Not a girl."

490
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,320
Oh, wow.

491
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,620
That realization is the
only thing that stopped me

492
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,409
from becoming a pile of goo.

493
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,453
Oh.

494
00:19:13,454 --> 00:19:15,029
Wait, how did you pull it off?

495
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,289
You were outside on the platform
with me the whole time.

496
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,330
We brought two bad Janets on the train,

497
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,579
you dumb, dumb idiot.

498
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,130
The other one distracted
you on the platform

499
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,340
while good Janet brought
Chris onto the train.

500
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,709
I snuck out, marbelized Janet,

501
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,100
and then I took over, baby.

502
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,219
Stupid Michael never knew.

503
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,889
I had you fartknockers fooled for weeks,

504
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,100
until Glenn the traitor
ruined everything.

505
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,110
That guy sucks, right?

506
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,150
Shut up, Glenn.

507
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,189
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

508
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,610
Bad Janets can't
impersonate Good Janets.

509
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,569
I've seen them try.
Their heads melt, so...

510
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,859
Oh. Oh, you're so smart, sir.

511
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,199
Well, listen, here's the thing.

512
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,220
Shawn rebooted me,
like, 40 million tines.

513
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,409
Wait, tine-him-is.

514
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,500
Time-ses. These things rule.

515
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,640
Oh, dip. This means
Janet didn't dump me.

516
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,050
Her weird sister did.

517
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,539
Everything makes so much more sense.

518
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,549
All of Janet's ideas were
so counterproductive.

519
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,420
She brought the horse monster to life.

520
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,940
She forced me to antagonize John.

521
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,000
She got us to doubt Eleanor's
leadership skills.

522
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,380
Oh, I was just about to launch an idea

523
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,820
where Tahani was gonna give herself

524
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,019
an asymmetrical haircut.

525
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,510
You monster.

526
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,600
Thank you!

527
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:27,040
Guys, we still have a problem here.

528
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,859
You still don't have evidence
that I'm actually me.

529
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,030
Sure, we do.

530
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,530
You offered to sacrifice yourself

531
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,180
to help a bunch of cockroaches.

532
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,320
That's about the most
Michael thing you could do.

533
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,440
Then where's real Janet?

534
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,880
Oh, she's in the Bad Place.

535
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,150
She's probably wiping her
butt with her own butt.

536
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,710
I can't bear the idea of poor
Janet down there all alone.

537
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,129
What should we do?

538
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,460
I know what to do.

539
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,480
It's like what that
guy who blew up said.

540
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,480
Shawn's a bully,

541
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,960
and sometimes, the only
thing a bully understands

542
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,440
is punch in the mouth.

543
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,280
I'm gonna go down there,

544
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,800
I'm gonna punch him in the mouth,

545
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,680
and I'm gonna get Janet back!

546
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,109
Oh, sounds like somebody has a plan.

547
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,810
Dope. Where is he?

548
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,739
- What's the plan?
- It's okay.

549
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,230
You sure you can hold down the fort?

550
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,640
Not at all.

551
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,249
You sure you can do your thing?

552
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,800
Nope.

553
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,000
We'll just try our best. Right?

554
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,249
Okay, let's go get our girl.

555
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,300
Not a girl.

556
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,230
