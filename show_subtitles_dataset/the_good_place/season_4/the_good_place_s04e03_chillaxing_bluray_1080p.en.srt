1
00:00:00,514 --> 00:00:02,179
He came to one session,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,202
and then he said he got a B+
in Moral Values at Princeton,

3
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:07,016
and so maybe he should be the professor.

4
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:09,241
Then he asked me if I knew
that he went Princeton.

5
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,861
I said I did.

6
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:13,523
Then he said he went to
Princeton, and he left.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,346
Eh, what are you gonna do?

8
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:18,156
Well, just for argument's
sake, what would Kant say

9
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:20,663
about your duty to help
your fellow human beings?

10
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:23,231
Well, honestly, when the
weather is this perfect,

11
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,624
I think that Kant would say,

12
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,331
"Who's up for some Frisbee golf?"

13
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:35,004
Guys, you gotta hear this
joke I made about Kant.

14
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:36,634
Never seen Chidi like that.

15
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,924
He was... chillaxing,

16
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:40,527
which is a word I just invented,

17
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:42,686
combing Chidi and relaxing.

18
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:45,633
Yeah, I guess once you have
the burden of saving humanity

19
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,972
removed from your brain, life is dandy.

20
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:49,608
Must be nice, Chidi.

21
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:50,730
That's what's missing.

22
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,486
Chidi isn't being tortured.

23
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:53,786
As far as he's concerned,

24
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,192
he did everything right on Earth,

25
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:57,568
so now he just gets to enjoy himself.

26
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,661
If we don't force Chidi into
stressful decision-making,

27
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:03,362
he won't get the chance to
become a better person.

28
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,359
Right. You want to make a pearl,

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,490
you gotta get some sand in your clam.

30
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:10,994
Oyster. We need Chidi to live
in a world of low-grade dread.

31
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:13,341
I've got this. I have
a ton of experience

32
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:15,299
making ex-boyfriends' lives miserable.

33
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,426
First up, we fill his acoustic
guitar with wet cat food.

34
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:21,012
Judge me all you want. I get results.

35
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:25,964
- Synced & corrected by MementMori -
www.addic7ed.com ...

36
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:29,722
- Janet, darling?
- Hi, there.

37
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,479
- Oh, you dyed your hair.
- I did.

38
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:34,060
After I broke up with Jason,
I researched how humans cope

39
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:35,318
with relationships ending,

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,023
and number eight on the list

41
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,271
was doing something dumb with your hair.

42
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:40,658
Number 42 was watch
"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,"

43
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:42,640
so I did that, too. It was okay.

44
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:44,470
It's just a lot of the same
songs as the first one.

45
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,346
Well, hopefully, diving back into work

46
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:49,248
was also high on that list
because we need to help John

47
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:50,824
and I know how.

48
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:52,912
- Spa day.
- Spa day?

49
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,078
That's right, Janet.

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,408
I've cracked the code.

51
00:01:55,412 --> 00:01:58,939
See, in 2014, John wrote eleven articles

52
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,379
mocking Gigi Hadid's vacation
at an exclusive resort in Bali.

53
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:05,556
But then he researched cheap
flights to Bali for himself,

54
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:07,184
and looked into something called...

55
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:09,806
a discount hotel package?

56
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:12,829
See, John's pettiness was the
result of feeling excluded

57
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,183
by the rich and powerful.

58
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:16,059
So I, the rich and powerful,

59
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:18,556
am going to welcome him
into an exclusive world

60
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:20,446
of luxury and pampering!

61
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:21,924
Oh, he loves celebrity gossip.

62
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,844
You should tell him about how
eight different characters

63
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:25,075
from "Game of Thrones" are based on you.

64
00:02:25,076 --> 00:02:27,165
That is a great idea.

65
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,996
See? You're getting it now.

66
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:30,790
First, we open his pores,

67
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,746
and then we open his heart.

68
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:36,019
We exfoliate the dead
skin cells of envy,

69
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:38,697
and we detoxify his soul.

70
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:39,928
Spa day.

71
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:41,217
Spa day.

72
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,173
I'm so excited for Spa day.

73
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:44,757
I mean, I know I can eat whatever

74
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:45,941
I want and not gain weight

75
00:02:45,945 --> 00:02:47,544
and the air is obviously perfect

76
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,972
and no one has any jobs
or stress or problems,

77
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:52,555
but I just feel like I need this.

78
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:54,071
Well, you are in for a treat

79
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:56,571
'cause I had Janet
build an exact replica

80
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,691
of Victoria Beckham's
ultra-exclusive private spa.

81
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:02,061
Posh's spa? The Posh Wash?

82
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:04,449
It's the most coveted
invitation in England.

83
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,918
Membership is based on
weight and net worth.

84
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,701
Gain a pound or lose a
pound, and you're out.

85
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:11,161
Shall we go?

86
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:13,703
Jason, there you are?

87
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:14,831
We need your help.

88
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:16,998
Okay. Hand me the jar.

89
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:18,581
Of what?

90
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,002
The peanut butter jar. Get it.

91
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:24,625
You said you needed help
opening a peanut butter jar.

92
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:25,835
No, we didn't.

93
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:28,632
Oh. Then who said that?

94
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,520
No one. Shut up and listen.

95
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,889
We need your help with
something very important.

96
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:34,640
Are you sure? I'm probably
just gonna mess it up.

97
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:36,000
Just like I messed things up with Janet.

98
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,580
Dude, helping to save humanity

99
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:40,941
is as good a way as any
to get over a breakup.

100
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:43,072
I mean, it's not like Janet
has a car you can key,

101
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:45,027
or a house you can "Left Eye" Lopes.

102
00:03:45,028 --> 00:03:47,695
Okay. I'm in.

103
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:50,078
I got your back, guys.
Now hand me that jar.

104
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,350
Are you speaking metaphorically,

105
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,402
like the task we're embarking on

106
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,042
is a metaphorical jar

107
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:59,917
you're gonna open by
accomplishing the task?

108
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:03,503
Yes.

109
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:05,421
Oh, goodie.

110
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:07,241
Cucumber water.

111
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:11,104
Nope. This is fresh water
from Oprah's estate in Maui

112
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,205
with mushrooms from her private bog

113
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:14,473
in the Pyrenees Mountains.

114
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:16,763
Oh, my God. It tastes like candy.

115
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,191
You know what they say.
A mushroom from Oprah's bog

116
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,563
is better than anything
from anywhere else.

117
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,002
Ugh, I didn't know that they said that.

118
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:26,378
I missed out on all the
cool celebrity sayings.

119
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:28,328
Say good-bye to FOMO.

120
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,670
You can finally experience
the best of the best.

121
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,843
The only thing that would
make this any better

122
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,804
is some hot goss.

123
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:36,831
Very well.

124
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,944
Our story begins

125
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,564
when I ran into Robbie
Williams, Heidi Klum,

126
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,746
and the remaining members
of Fifth Harmony

127
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,757
at the Dolce & Gabbana spring show.

128
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:47,151
Hate him, loathe her,
over them, cancel it,

129
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,420
tell me everything.

130
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,700
So Natalie Portman does all of
Scarlett Johansson's stunts?

131
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:53,380
- Why?
- For the power.

132
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,300
Just to say she can.

133
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,643
Sure, I get that.

134
00:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,604
Tahani, I feel amazing. Thank you.

135
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,347
You're quite welcome!

136
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:05,482
Hey, you know what would give
you an even more luminous glow?

137
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,155
There was this sort of inner treatment

138
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,231
that was all the rage on Earth,

139
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:10,999
the study of ethics.

140
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:13,613
Think of it as a colonic,
but for your soul!

141
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,406
Our resident philosopher Chidi Anagonye

142
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,283
leads an ethics study
group in his apartment.

143
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,529
What do you say you and I sit in?

144
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:22,181
Would I like to use my time in heaven

145
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:25,499
to audit a philosophy class?

146
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,439
Um...

147
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,460
no.

148
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,878
You stay crazy, girl!

149
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,959
Bye.

150
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,847
- Hey!
- Hi!

151
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:37,402
- So how was the picnic?
- Oh, amazing.

152
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,033
I mean, there were ants everywhere,

153
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,473
but they were so helpful.

154
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,379
They carried our wine
glasses back and forth

155
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,919
and they folded our napkins for us.

156
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,602
- They were so cute.
- Wait till you see

157
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,442
the otters who do our turn-down service.

158
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:49,753
Listen, you might know Jianyu, the monk?

159
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:51,982
He wants to join your
philosophy study group.

160
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:53,880
Oh, sure, we can get that
up and running again.

161
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,384
Maybe discuss some
Lao Tzu and Confucius.

162
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,117
Fun! Everything is so fun.

163
00:05:58,118 --> 00:05:59,825
Perfect. Just one thing.

164
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,549
So he's been having kind of
a hard time adjusting here.

165
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,329
Apparently monks aren't the
most social creatures.

166
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,624
So just promise me you'll
help him no matter what.

167
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,902
Eleanor, I swear to you

168
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,926
I will look after Jianyu as
if he is my own brother.

169
00:06:13,931 --> 00:06:16,746
Wow. I mean, a promise

170
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,644
from a strict Kantian like yourself

171
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:20,714
is just about the most
ironclad agreement

172
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,145
in the universe.

173
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:24,475
Okay.

174
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,066
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

175
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:29,484
So, Jianyu, would you like some...

176
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,319
Yo, shut up for a sec.
I'm not a Buddhist monk.

177
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,841
My name is Jason Mendoza.

178
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:34,123
I'm a DJ from Florida,

179
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:35,503
and I'm not supposed to be here.

180
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:36,937
You gotta help me out, homie.

181
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,080
I'm scared.

182
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,582
Tea. I was gonna offer you some tea.

183
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:45,055
- Dude, thanks to you,

184
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,112
my dream came true.

185
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,830
I have a shiny new butthole.

186
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:50,320
- You okay, homie?
- No!

187
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:52,349
I've had a stomach ache for a week.

188
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,139
There have been way
too many close calls.

189
00:06:54,142 --> 00:06:56,841
Please, I beg you, no
more meatball subs.

190
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:59,361
No more drawing boobs in the dirt.

191
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:01,232
I cannot lie to cover for you.

192
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:04,071
Please remember you're
supposed to be a monk.

193
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:07,374
Hey!

194
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,004
Eleanor and Michael are here.

195
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:10,436
What a fun surprise.

196
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:11,924
- You've done some redecorating.
- Oh.

197
00:07:11,926 --> 00:07:15,745
Uh, yes, my apartment was
decorated in one way,

198
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:18,113
and now it has been... redecorated.

199
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:21,263
- And how's Jianyu?
- I mean, you know how monks are.

200
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:23,699
Calm, peaceful, never, you know,

201
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,098
shotgunning Cheez Whiz.

202
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,116
I mean, what monk
would do that? No monk!

203
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:28,246
Anyway...

204
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:30,823
I see you guys are still here.

205
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:32,920
We were just dropping by to ask a favor.

206
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,930
Can you accompany Jianyu
to the luau tonight?

207
00:07:35,937 --> 00:07:38,629
He still isn't really engaging
with the Neighborhood,

208
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,126
and we were hoping you could help him

209
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,169
break out of his shell.

210
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:43,386
Actually, I don't think I can make it.

211
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,299
Oh, why not?

212
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,307
I just remembered.

213
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:50,136
I can make it, so I will see you there.

214
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,475
Okay, bye.

215
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,662
I don't understand why John
hasn't made more progress.

216
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,736
You've done so much to
make him feel special.

217
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:04,142
I know. I recreated the
private tour of the Louvre

218
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:05,653
where they let you touch all the art.

219
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,430
We rode Aquamans through the water.

220
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:09,427
I got so many beauty treatments

221
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:12,491
I fear my hair may be
too shiny and lustrous.

222
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:13,784
We've been getting on quite well,

223
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:16,545
but every time I bring
up self-improvement,

224
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:18,167
he just shuts me down.

225
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:19,812
I haven't encountered
this much resistance

226
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,210
since I tried to get Timothée Chalamet

227
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:22,541
to go out into the sun.

228
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,213
You know, I looked at
John's files again.

229
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:27,181
He was hardly a shrinking violet.

230
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:28,185
If you think he needs help,

231
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:29,931
maybe you should just tell him directly.

232
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,580
Perhaps you're right.

233
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:33,017
I shall go on the attack,

234
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:34,466
just like six of the eight

235
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:37,044
"Game of Thrones" characters
who were based on me would do.

236
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:38,355
Yeah.

237
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:40,352
So how are things going with Chidi?

238
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,818
Super easy. All I have
to do is be myself,

239
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:44,271
and he's constantly freaking out.

240
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:46,177
You have that effect on people, bud.

241
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:47,950
What else can we do to mess up his life?

242
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:50,363
Listen, E-dog,

243
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:52,765
I know people don't look to me for plans

244
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,370
or ideas or anything,

245
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:57,149
but maybe we should ease off.

246
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:58,629
He's pretty stressed already.

247
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,822
Please. He's not even dry-heaving yet.

248
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:02,416
How many Tums did he take today?

249
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,077
- Like 20.
- Pfft, that's nothing.

250
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,628
We don't stop until it's a whole bottle.

251
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:07,122
Because the more miserable he is,

252
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:08,690
the more he's going to teach you,

253
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:11,140
and then everyone, and
then he'll save humanity.

254
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:14,305
He's like Superman
with nervous diarrhea.

255
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:16,639
Get ready. I'm gonna
make that speech soon.

256
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,019
Hey, girl.

257
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,380
Want to hit up the spa tomorrow?

258
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,138
I want to try that new
"Little Mermaid" treatment,

259
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,538
the one where they
remove your vocal chords

260
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,484
and it somehow makes
your legs look amazing.

261
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,411
Perhaps, but I was
hoping to bend your ear

262
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:29,945
on a more serious matter.

263
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,947
The things you used to write,

264
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,368
frankly... were hurtful.

265
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:36,245
What? Name one.

266
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:37,356
I gained five pounds,

267
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:39,456
and you called me
Ta-Hammy All-the-Meals.

268
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:41,163
I mean, that's just poetry.

269
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,478
Well, you were so mean
to Daniel Day-Lewis,

270
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:43,872
- he quit acting.
- Oh, I'm sorry,

271
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:44,983
was he living in character

272
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,700
as a man who thought he could
pull off boot-cut jeans?

273
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,198
You know what? I see what this is.

274
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:49,756
This has been a fake friendship.

275
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,377
This whole week has just been a wind-up

276
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:52,627
to a sucker-punch.

277
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:54,537
No, it hasn't.

278
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,890
I just want you to recognize
that your blog hurt people.

279
00:09:57,895 --> 00:10:00,769
And you have a chance to be better here.

280
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,187
B'scuse me?

281
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:04,350
You're telling me to be better?

282
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,721
While you were gallivanting
around with your fancy friends,

283
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:09,698
I lived in the real world,
so I had bills to pay.

284
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:12,322
I worked 16 hours a day by myself

285
00:10:12,323 --> 00:10:14,661
building a site with
millions of readers.

286
00:10:14,662 --> 00:10:16,461
You're the one with issues, sweetheart.

287
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,282
If you spot it, you got it.

288
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,495
Whoosh.

289
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:23,448
That's another deuce
for the gossip toilet.

290
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,298
Hello and welcome!
Is everyone having fun tonight?

291
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,634
We have an exciting activity
planned for all of you.

292
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,888
You have all been given
a magic lava stone.

293
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:40,685
When you throw them into the bonfire,

294
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:45,190
you will receive whatever
your soul most desires.

295
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,441
Ahh.

296
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:48,026
Step right up, Matilda.

297
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:49,831
Give it a toss.

298
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:59,786
My childhood pet, Shell Turtlestein.

299
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:01,163
Oh, hi!

300
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:02,170
I want to do that.

301
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:05,584
No, you cannot under any
circumstances do that.

302
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,440
Okay, but I gotta do that.

303
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:09,477
No! If you throw that stone,

304
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:11,837
your truest actual desire will appear,

305
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,249
and who knows what that is?

306
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,779
I do. My old motorcycle
with Pamela Anderson

307
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:17,223
airbrushed on the side.

308
00:11:17,224 --> 00:11:18,792
It exploded a week after I got it

309
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:21,102
because someone wanted
to see what would happen

310
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,311
if they poured lighter
fluid in the engine.

311
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:24,477
Was that someone you?

312
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:26,158
Yep. Turns out it explodes.

313
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,128
Called it. Look, maybe Jianyu the monk

314
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,489
likes motorcycles.

315
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,199
We don't know his life.

316
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,895
No monk's truest desire is a motorcycle

317
00:11:34,896 --> 00:11:37,116
with Pam Anderson's face painted on it.

318
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:38,990
Oh, it wasn't her face.

319
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:42,080
No!

320
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:48,332
A sexually explicit motorcycle?

321
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,750
Whose rock was that?

322
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,928
Hey, it's mine.

323
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,993
Jianyu tossed my rock

324
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:58,562
because he wanted to
help me, his friend,

325
00:11:58,563 --> 00:12:00,460
who loves motorcycles

326
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,999
and Canadian TV actress Pamela Anderson.

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,719
Thanks, Jianyu.
And now I will ride it away.

328
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:13,198
Can't wait to cruise the
streets in this bad boy.

329
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,800
Yeah, man.

330
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,218
Now we're cooking with gas.

331
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,498
Well, this was a huge success.

332
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:19,980
Chidi's an absolute mess.

333
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:22,082
Oh, we should pop open some champagne.

334
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,090
Call those magic ants.

335
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:25,357
He's clearly being tested
like never before.

336
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:27,580
Yeah, and now we need to
ramp up the pressure.

337
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:29,918
Eleanor, he told an outright lie.

338
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,159
We don't want him so freaked out

339
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,499
that he can't help anyone else.

340
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:33,824
I think we did enough for the day.

341
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,764
No way, dude. We can't stop now.

342
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:37,424
We have to push him to the edge.

343
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,697
We have to knead his fragile psyche

344
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:40,897
until he's hyperventilating

345
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:42,578
and losing his mind.

346
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,467
Hi, guys, um...

347
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:47,057
- can we talk?
- Yeah.

348
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:48,110
I need to tell you a secret.

349
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:49,910
I...

350
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:53,486
I can't...

351
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,699
No, no, guys, guys, not now.

352
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,530
I Spent my whole life on Earth
battling a stomach ache

353
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,501
because I never knew what to do.

354
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:09,159
And for a while here, that was gone,

355
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,789
but recently, I've been miserable.

356
00:13:11,796 --> 00:13:13,643
Why, Chidi? You're in the Good Place.

357
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:15,941
I know, but I have this problem,

358
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:20,349
and if I choose option A...

359
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:22,560
But if I choose option B...

360
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,601
No.

361
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,321
You know, Chidi,

362
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:29,851
sometimes adversity can lead to growth.

363
00:13:29,855 --> 00:13:31,724
Whatever the moral dilemma is,

364
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:34,948
maybe you'll come out on the
other side better for it.

365
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,820
Yeah.

366
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:37,990
No.

367
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:39,451
I'm used to moral dilemmas.

368
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,231
I like moral dilemmas.

369
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:44,124
They're my jam, but this
just feels like I'm...

370
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,161
- What?
- Like I'm being punished somehow.

371
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:49,704
And, obviously, I know that's silly.
This is the Good Place.

372
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,384
You two would never do
anything to hurt anyone,

373
00:13:51,385 --> 00:13:55,379
but I am seriously worried
that I did something wrong,

374
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:59,453
and this is the universe
getting back at me.

375
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,923
Oh, no.

376
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:04,599
What's happening now?

377
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:05,657
Oh, no.

378
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:06,676
No, no, no, no, no.

379
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,027
No, I made God cry?

380
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:12,818
Oh, stomach ache.
Welcome back, old friend.

381
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:15,043
I can't believe John.

382
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,872
The man who once started a
protracted Twitter feud

383
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,614
with Jacob Tremblay thinks
I'm the one with issues?

384
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:23,643
Maybe you need to be even
more direct with him.

385
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:25,120
Like, punch him in the face.

386
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,098
I don't know. I'm fired up.

387
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,708
You've just been very nice to him

388
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,583
and I don't like the
way he's treating you.

389
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:32,312
Maybe it's not possible.
We're just too different.

390
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:34,505
He spent his life in the
bowels of the Internet,

391
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,526
jealous and miserable
with no real friends,

392
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,586
while I spent my life

393
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:40,323
in the upper echelon of society...

394
00:14:40,324 --> 00:14:44,362
jealous and miserable with...

395
00:14:44,367 --> 00:14:46,465
no real friends.

396
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:47,523
Oh, Janet.

397
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,147
I've been going about this all wrong.

398
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:50,731
Exactly. Here you go.

399
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:52,941
Oh, uh... no, I'm...

400
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,485
Why? Why are you crying?

401
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,873
This is all my fault.

402
00:14:57,874 --> 00:15:00,531
I promised I'd take care of you, Chidi.

403
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,449
- You did?
- Yes. I promised.

404
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:06,332
Uh, see, Chidi,
the Architect is responsible

405
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:07,695
for the entire Neighborhood,

406
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:10,803
so a resident suffering in any way,

407
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,343
it's very painful for her.

408
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,462
Actually, come here. Come here.

409
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:16,219
But don't worry.

410
00:15:16,227 --> 00:15:19,022
We have a very simple
solution for problems here.

411
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,162
Oh, good. What is it?

412
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:21,331
We eliminate them.

413
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:24,140
So you just tell us a problem,
and we'll eliminate it,

414
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:27,826
like, say you had a
problem with that vase.

415
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,301
See?

416
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:31,811
So just tell me what's bothering you,

417
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,979
I'll wave my hand, it'll explode,

418
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,733
and you can go back to your
otherwise perfect life.

419
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,825
Uh... the motorcycle.

420
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:42,116
Yep. That's my problem.

421
00:15:42,117 --> 00:15:44,121
For some reason, it just
hasn't been bringing me

422
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:46,200
as much happiness as maybe
it wasn't intended to,

423
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,700
so I'd just as soon get rid of it.

424
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:49,710
Done.

425
00:15:50,428 --> 00:15:52,873
Oh, not again.

426
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:54,087
No more motorcycle.

427
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,714
- Problem solved.
- Great.

428
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,660
Uh, Eleanor, I hope you feel better.

429
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:01,006
No, no, she'll be fine. She'll be fine.

430
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,634
John, I have something to say.

431
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,307
Round two. Let's do this.

432
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:09,042
In 2007, Blake Lively invited
me to a birthday party

433
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:12,061
held for Leonardo DiCaprio
aboard Paul Allen's mega-yacht.

434
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:14,144
I see we're dropping names
three at a time now.

435
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,383
The guest list was 100
of the wealthiest,

436
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:18,573
most famous members of the glitterati.

437
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:21,281
Once aboard, I discovered
there was a VIP deck.

438
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:22,546
And within that area,

439
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,293
there was an even more exclusive room

440
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:26,332
that you could only
access with a secret PIN,

441
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:27,829
which I promptly entered.

442
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,484
And guess who was waiting for me.

443
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:32,711
I hate to admit it, but
I have to know. Who?

444
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,002
No one.

445
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:35,442
I was the only one there.

446
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,575
The party raged on outside,

447
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:41,467
but I was so obsessed with
status that I never left.

448
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,910
I spent the entire night
talking to no one.

449
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:45,250
Riveting story.

450
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:47,139
If only it were longer and sadder.

451
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:48,325
The point is,

452
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:52,222
if all you care about in the
world is the velvet rope,

453
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,563
you will always be unhappy no
matter which side you're on.

454
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:58,188
You and I are proof of that.

455
00:16:58,189 --> 00:16:59,848
But now we're here.

456
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:02,644
Can we just start over?

457
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:05,054
Well...

458
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,446
if we're gonna be friends,
I need to say something.

459
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:13,284
I really am sorry for all the
posts I wrote about you.

460
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:14,944
And everything I tweeted.

461
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:16,844
And scrawled on the back of a playbill

462
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:18,147
during the intermission of "Wicked"

463
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:19,456
and had someone pass it to you

464
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:21,842
and say it was from an
anonymous concerned citizen.

465
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:23,463
That was you?

466
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:26,698
Well, my bangs were making
my ears look chunky.

467
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:27,718
That was a fair hit.

468
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:32,648
It's a lovely night.

469
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:34,105
Would you like to go for a walk?

470
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:43,376
Okay, Jason, new plan.

471
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:45,823
Instead of just trying
to not get caught,

472
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,252
we're going to study ethics.

473
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:50,280
I'm going to help you
become a good person.

474
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,041
Oh, dope. I always want to get better.

475
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:54,536
That's why I spent so much of
my time at the free clinic.

476
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,042
Hang on.

477
00:17:56,043 --> 00:17:58,700
Just editing my syllabus in my
head based on that comment.

478
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:00,270
This is gonna be awesome. You rule.

479
00:18:00,277 --> 00:18:03,403
You're like the Pam Anderson
boob motorcycle of people.

480
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:05,417
Thank you. That's an amazing compliment.

481
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,319
And I'm sorry your actual
motorcycle blew up.

482
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,759
Oh, that's okay, homie.

483
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:11,845
That's just what motorcycles do.

484
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,178
So Chidi's set with Jason now.

485
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,683
How are you doing?

486
00:18:17,684 --> 00:18:19,182
A little better.

487
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,561
But still terrible.

488
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:22,162
You were torturing him

489
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:23,856
because that's what we had to do.

490
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:26,641
I know. But I went too far.

491
00:18:26,642 --> 00:18:27,761
And what's worse...

492
00:18:27,762 --> 00:18:30,182
I liked it.

493
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,928
Because I'm angry at him.

494
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,679
For leaving me.

495
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,358
Which isn't even remotely fair,

496
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,460
because he sacrificed himself for us.

497
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,490
But I'm still angry he abandoned me,

498
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,000
which makes me feel guilty,

499
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,111
which makes me angry,

500
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:46,899
which makes me want to talk to Chidi

501
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,339
because he's the person
I go to when I'm angry.

502
00:18:49,341 --> 00:18:52,001
So it's a real fun cycle.

503
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,260
I still don't have a grip on
the human emotional spectrum.

504
00:18:57,268 --> 00:19:00,347
You guys are often happy
when you should be sad

505
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,921
and angry when you should be happy,

506
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:04,312
and texting when you should be driving,

507
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:06,024
which is not an emotion,

508
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,065
I know, but it's insane.

509
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:10,308
The point is, in this case,

510
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,059
even if it's not rational,

511
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,979
you're allowed to feel a little angry.

512
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,821
Let yourself off the hook.

513
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:19,369
Process it and work your way through it,

514
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,412
and then get your shirt together.

515
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:23,206
Because we have a lot of work to do.

516
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,139
Morning, all.

517
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:28,662
Anyone interested in a status report?

518
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:31,380
I win. I mean, I'll start.

519
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:34,299
I have made massive progress with John.

520
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:36,542
Great. Is he gonna join Chidi's class?

521
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,673
Philosophy may not be his way forward.

522
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,642
Genuine human connection shall
be his course of study.

523
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:44,341
And first up on the syllabus,

524
00:19:44,342 --> 00:19:47,339
he and I will be unironically watching

525
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:50,312
the Britney Spears movie
"Crossroads" together...

526
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:52,398
And you'll have to trust me,

527
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:55,449
this is a huge step in
the right direction.

528
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,986
Wonderful work, Tahani.

529
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,076
And, Jason, I mean, bravo.

530
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,862
Thanks, guys.

531
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:03,758
It's been a tough couple weeks,

532
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,626
