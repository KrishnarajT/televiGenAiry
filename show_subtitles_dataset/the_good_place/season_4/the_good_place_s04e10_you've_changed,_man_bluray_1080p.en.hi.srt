1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,850
Ugh. All Janet voids are nothing,

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,450
but Neutral Janet voids are,
like, the most nothing.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,670
Judge, please, please
don't cancel Earth.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,720
Why not?

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,450
The system's broken. You guys proved it.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,749
I just want to reboot the whole thing,

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,760
and go back to my chambers.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,760
I am on season three of "Justified,"

9
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,519
and can I just tell you,
it is... so good.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,149
I, like, binged all of
season two in a day.

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,190
Think of all the amazing
human achievement

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,470
you'd be eliminating.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,090
The works of William Shakespeare.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,340
The Pyramids.

15
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,850
Timothy Olyphant.

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,949
Ooh, that one stings.

17
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,460
There's, like, 50 gallons
of man in a 10-gallon hat.

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,659
I'm, like, oh!

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,619
Look, I'm the freaking Judge,

20
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,369
and I made a freaking ruling,

21
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,520
and it's gonna freaking happen,

22
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,000
soon as I find the
freaking clicker thing.

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,299
All right, what do I search for?

24
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,430
Humanity eraser button garage
door opener thingy judge.

25
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,030
Well, it wasn't in you. Any last words?

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,769
These are my last words. End of words.

27
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,920
Yes. Really boring.

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,940
Bye!

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,880
All right, who's next?

30
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,850
Your dad's pimply butt, you fat dink.

31
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,350
That is so interesting
because last time I checked,

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,690
I didn't have a dad.

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,720
That's why I'm attracted
to all the father figures

34
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,760
on the TV shows I watch.

35
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,780
Mm-kmm?

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,421
We can't play keep-away forever.

37
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:32,249
Keep trying. Get her to see the light.

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,410
I already showed her the light.

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,700
She wasn't impressed.

40
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,719
To be fair, she was there
when it was invented.

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,120
- Hey, bud?
- Hi.

42
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,540
I know you're trying to
think of ways to save

43
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,389
every soul who's ever lived
and whatnot, but, um,

44
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,740
we may only have a
half hour left to exist,

45
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,080
so I just wanted to check
in with you vis-?-vis...

46
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,349
us.

47
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,290
Oh, okay, yeah. Cool.

48
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,310
I love you.

49
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,149
Whoa. Really?

50
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,260
Yeah.

51
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,700
I love you. So, uh, do you love me?

52
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,660
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, then, cool!

53
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,159
You and I are on our way to Coolsville.

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,180
You seem oddly sure,
which is unlike you, but...

55
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,490
it's kind of doing it for me.

56
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,880
Should we get out of here?

57
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,210
No, but I like the confidence.

58
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,590
Well, when you have a thousand
different versions of yourself

59
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,390
over multiple timelines fused

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,310
and instantly placed
into your consciousness,

61
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,089
it gives you a real sense of clarity.

62
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,840
You saw the time knife, huh?

63
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,760
Yep. Saw the time knife.

64
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,510
It was neat.

65
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,790
Okay, let's save humanity, shall we?

66
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,109
Can one of you Janets
get me a chalkboard

67
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,710
and a copy of Judith
Shklar's "Ordinary Vices?"

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,480
Oh, and maybe some warm
pretzels. If we going out,

69
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,770
I'm going out with a belly
full of warm pretzels.

70
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,030
Yummy, yum, yum.

71
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,650
Yummy!

72

73
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,090
Okay, before we try to completely

74
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,039
redesign the entire afterlife,

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,760
has anyone just thought of a good reason

76
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,089
the Judge shouldn't cancel Earth?

77
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,710
Because it would be a bummer.

78
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,299
Yeah, we might need more than that.

79
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,049
Are you at least gonna write it down?

80
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,670
Did you actually write it down,

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,849
or did you just do a scribble-scrabble?

82
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,390
Okay, we need to think bigger.

83
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,100
We need to come up with an
entirely new afterlife system

84
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,420
that both the Good and
Bad Places agree on,

85
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,779
which seems impossible.

86
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,190
Nonsense.

87
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,750
Compromise is always possible.

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,030
I was once in Portofino with Bruno Mars,

89
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,820
LeBron James, and Dr. Ruth Westheimer...

90
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,350
We don't have time for
this right now, babe.

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,590
Fine. Long story short,

92
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,530
LeBron performed a
successful tracheotomy,

93
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,360
the son won multiple Grammys,

94
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,870
and everyone was really happy.

95
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,379
Well, now I want to hear the story.

96
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,150
No, you're right. Let's focus.

97
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,460
So, in this essay,
"Putting Cruelty First,"

98
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,429
Judith Shklar contends
that we should consider

99
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,150
cruelty as society's primary flaw.

100
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,349
I'm sorry, are you
wearing roller skates?

101
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,960
Yeah. I got them from Disco Janet.

102
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,979
Thanks, Disco Janet.

103
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,320
- Solid.
- Anyway, here's her point.

104
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,269
Imagine someone sells a joint

105
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,310
and then gets locked away in
a dangerous prison for years.

106
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,390
The crime isn't cruel,
but the punishment is.

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,230
- That's a problem.
- Tell me about it.

108
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,670
I once went to jail for a week

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,190
just because I stole a hot dog.

110
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,400
Well, a hot-dog-shaped car.

111
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,079
I stole the Wienermobile.

112
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,079
This is the problem with
the current system.

113
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,890
Live anything less than
the most exemplary life,

114
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,610
and you are brutally tortured
forever with no recourse.

115
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,290
The cruelty of the punishment

116
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,280
does not match the cruelty of
the life that one has lived.

117
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,340
Now, watch this spin.

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,770
So we need to come up with a system

119
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,760
that will result in the least amount

120
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,889
of cruelty and suffering to
those who don't deserve it.

121
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,680
This is a problem of justice.

122
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,470
Hearing you talk about
philosophical concepts

123
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,319
of justice is sexy.

124
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,630
- You want to get out of here?
- Yes.

125
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,279
No. Keep going.

126
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,119
Ugh. Bad Janet voids are the worst.

127
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,290
Music off!

128
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,710
Oh, right, I forgot.

129
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,910
Make it louder!

130
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,110
What if you start humanity
over from scratch,

131
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,150
and humans evolve over millions of years

132
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,490
and they end up worse?

133
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,690
What if they invent rap-rock sooner,

134
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,419
and it becomes the only kind of music?

135
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,290
Do you really want to
oversee an entire world

136
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,049
of Limp Bizkits run by Emperor Kid Rock?

137
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,139
Not my problem.

138
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,610
All right, here we go. Software update?

139
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,389
No, cancel.

140
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,482
Why is it doing it now?

141
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,860
This computer sucks.

142
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,690
Okay, mama. See you in the next life.

143
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,989
Before you marbleize me,

144
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,570
can I just make one final statement

145
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,199
to summarize how I really feel?

146
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
I think I know where this is going.

147
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,230
Okay, Disco Janet, you're up.

148
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,420
Out of sight.

149
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,890
What are you guys still doing here?

150
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,340
Just go back to Mindy's
and have a lukewarm beer,

151
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,639
and wait for me to end you there.

152
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,139
Except for you, cookie-puss.

153
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,840
I'll always make room for you.

154
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,720
Wait a second. That's it.

155
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,790
I agree. Chidi should
hook up with the Judge

156
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,930
to get us out of trouble.

157
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,950
I'd done that a bunch of times.

158
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,319
It's called a Jacksonville plea bargain.

159
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,400
No, Mindy's house.

160
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,230
Eleanor always thought there
should be a Medium Place

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,829
for people who led medium lives.

162
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,449
That's the answer.

163
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,710
We make the Medium Place a third option.

164
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,630
Of course. Maybe if you score
negative points on Earth...

165
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,800
sorry, you blew it.

166
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,570
Enjoy having your penis flattened.

167
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Over a million or whatever, party time.

168
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,970
And everyone else in between

169
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,710
gets their own personal Cincinnati.

170
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,430
It's definitely less cruel
than the current system,

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,170
but it's not great.

172
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,970
Well, it might be the best we
can do given the circumstances.

173
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,680
Let's try to sell it to the brass.

174
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,439
Hello, all.

175
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,640
Thought as the universe is ending,

176
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,569
you'd be less cheery.

177
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,340
Hard not to be cheery when you're eating

178
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,279
this delicious frozen yogurt.

179
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,110
I got a small amount of each flavor.

180
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,199
It's the only way to ensure
a mouthful of compromise.

181
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,913
- You are so right.
- Well said.

182
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,030
Shut up! Shut up.

183
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,990
Hi. Shut up.

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,010
- I'm confident now.
- Oh, sorry.

185
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,390
We're just short on time.
Look, we have a new idea

186
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,089
about how humans could be
placed in the afterlife...

187
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,629
We love it. We're in.

188
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,259
You don't even want to hear it?

189
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,263
Nope. If you guys came up
with it, it must be good.

190
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:14,049
- Oh, yeah.
- Guys, they said yes.

191
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,140
Let's take the win.

192
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,969
Now all we have to do is convince Shawn.

193
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,070
I'll take the lead.

194
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,340
If I can convince Dr. Ruth
not to sue Bruno Mars

195
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,980
over songwriting credit
on "Uptown Funk,"

196
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,010
I can handle this.

197
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,640
Okay, you gotta tell me
that story on the way.

198
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,700
So anyone who doesn't meet the threshold

199
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,260
for the new Medium Place Neighborhood

200
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,300
is yours for the taking.

201
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,910
The Bad Place still has
plenty of people to torture.

202
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,030
I have to admit this does make sense.

203
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,380
And I like that your side is
settling for a crappy deal

204
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,380
while my side stays mostly the same.

205
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,720
What the hell. I'm in.

206
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,920
- Really?
- No.

207
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,540
You actually believed me?

208
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,160
Dude, in 20 minutes, all of humanity

209
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,099
is going to be erased forever.

210
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
And?

211
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,410
The Bad Place will get emptied out, too.

212
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,880
You will have no one to torture
for billions of years.

213
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,260
Everyone loses.

214
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,139
Oh, I know.

215
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,810
But here's the thing.

216
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,610
I don't care if everyone
loses as long as you lose.

217
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,690
- Shawn, listen to reason.
- Why should I?

218
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,990
None of this would've
happened if you hadn't

219
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,510
mucked around with your Neighborhood

220
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,930
and your new ideas.

221
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,580
New ideas are gross. They sicken me.

222
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,070
Shawn, you used to be cool,
but you've changed, man.

223
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,500
I'm gonna go write an evil speech

224
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,740
for when this is all over.

225
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,009
It is gonna be so long.

226
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,550
♪ You can ring my bell ♪

227
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,880
♪ Ring my bell ♪

228
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,020
Whoa!

229
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,160
♪ You can ring my bell ♪

230
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,390
Wait a second.

231
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,150
What was I doing?

232
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,169
I'll tell you what you were doing.

233
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,949
You were tearing up the dance floor.

234
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,460
No, I was looking for
the stupid clicker thingy.

235
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,039
God, those infectious disco grooves.

236
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,230
So wait, wait, wait, wait.

237
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,400
We have this amazing new idea,
and Shawn is almost on board.

238
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,770
Maybe if you talk to him,

239
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,166
you could nudge him
towards an agreement.

240
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,740
I don't take sides. I am the Judge.

241
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,505
My only concerns are
fairness and impartiality.

242
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,720
♪ Gonna erase the Earth ♪

243
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,440
♪ Erase the Earth ♪

244
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,630
That song is really my yam.

245
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,620
Humanity eraser thingy.

246
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,939
Welp. Later, skater.

247
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,399
Keep on truckin'.

248
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,519
Next!

249
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,900
Even for a demon,

250
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,119
Shawn is being a real knob.

251
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,800
Guys, I know what we have to offer him

252
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,949
to get him to change his mind.

253
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,320
- What?
- Something he wants.

254
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,288
Once we figure that out, we're golden.

255
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,950
It's pointless.

256
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,459
He's so focused on beating us

257
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,750
that he's willing to
burn everything down.

258
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,380
There's nothing we can offer him.

259
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,589
Actually, there is something he wants.

260
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,760
Cruelty.

261
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,886
So let's give it to him.

262
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,400
Oh, hey, guys. Just smashing some stuff.

263
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,438
- What's up?
- Listen, demon,

264
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:09,941
we know how much you want us to lose,

265
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,199
so we volunteer to lose permanently

266
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,610
if you agree to let the Judge

267
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,380
establish a real Medium Place.

268
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,579
You can torture the four of us...

269
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,609
forever.

270
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

271
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,720
This is a classic trolley problem.

272
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,850
One of your boys sets off a
stink bomb on the trolley,

273
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,760
causing a commotion so
the rest of the group

274
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,961
can pickpocket people as
they run off the train.

275
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,920
That's very wrong,
but in a roundabout way,

276
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,250
you kind of got where you needed to be.

277
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,899
I'll even give you a head
start on my torture.

278
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,919
I cannot pull off the "mod" look.

279
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,169
You can take me, too.

280
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,803
I couldn't live with myself

281
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:44,180
knowing you four were
down there without me.

282
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,050
Wow. This is a toughy.

283
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,430
On one hand, I would love

284
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,479
to get some spiders in those buttholes.

285
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,689
On the other hand,
there would be billions

286
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,470
of buttholes going
completely un-spidered.

287
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,910
How about this?

288
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,210
Everyone who dies go to the Bad Place...

289
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,449
and I get to torture all of you.

290
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,699
Sounds good to us.

291
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,279
No, dummies.

292
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,100
That's already how it works,

293
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,489
except we're also tortured.

294
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,409
Look, I put forward a proposal.

295
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,060
Are you not even going to negotiate?

296
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,530
He's got a point. The fair
thing for us to do is

297
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,170
just keep on giving up more and
more stuff we want unilaterally

298
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,092
until this demon's finally happy.

299
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,419
Fork this.

300
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,120
If we're gonna lose,
let's lose on our own terms.

301
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,370
Let's come up with a completely new idea

302
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,889
that actually makes the universe better.

303
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,560
Amen. At least then,
we can hold our heads high.

304
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,410
Okay, we need to come
up with our ideal plan

305
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,080
in about 10 minutes.

306
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,470
Guys, it's all come to this.

307
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,250
Everything we've been through...

308
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,250
multiple lives you led on Earth,

309
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,310
all the lives you led here,

310
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,090
all the ethics training
and lessons and journeys

311
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,900
to the farthest corners of the afterlife

312
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,830
all happened so that we
could be here together...

313
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,140
as the very best versions of ourselves,

314
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,120
to solve the ultimate problem...

315
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,830
in the nick of time.

316
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,930
Cool speech. Now it's nine minutes.

317
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,759
Chidi, can you do this?

318
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,990
Actually, what you just said,

319
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,720
the very best versions of ourselves,

320
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,309
gave me an idea.

321
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,470
Huh. Turns out it was a cool speech.

322
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,539
Not in you, either.

323
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,080
I just have one thing left to say.

324
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,282
No.

325
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,230
Not falling for that again.

326
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,300
Man, she is committed.

327
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,480
That just leaves you.

328
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,700
Your Honor, we have an idea
we'd like to present...

329
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,539
Not interested, stretch.

330
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,899
How can we convince her of our plan

331
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,079
if she won't even listen?

332
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,530
Well, if she's not gonna stay out here,

333
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,169
you gotta go in there.

334
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,759
But that didn't really
work great last time.

335
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,660
Yeah, it wasn't an amazing,
but she's gonna marbleize me

336
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,929
in, like, two minutes,
so we might as well try.

337
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,969
Are we all gonna be...

338
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,179
- you again?
- I don't think so.

339
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,429
Going through that once
changed me and all of you.

340
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,530
But if the Judge wasn't gonna
listen to us out here,

341
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,189
what makes you think
she'll listen to us in there?

342
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,280
I know one thing that
might keep her attention.

343
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,910
Idiots.

344
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,790
Aw, nuts.

345
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,660
How did I fall for that?

346
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,210
- Please, have a seat, Your Honor.
- I already told you.

347
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,140
I'm not interested.

348
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,190
Give me one reason why
I should hear you out?

349
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,209
Okay.

350
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,860
Here he is.

351
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,470
Ma'am.

352
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,370
You made me an Olyphant?

353
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,980
I think you should hear them out, Judge.

354
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,229
Only seems fair.

355
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,350
Yeah, you're probably right.

356
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,019
Well played, Janet.

357
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,540
I don't mind taking in the view

358
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,890
when the scenery is so pretty.

359
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,700
Oh, I should call Shawn for this.

360
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,220
Aw, man.

361
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,460
I had just gotten all the puppies

362
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,909
to climb into the cannon.

363
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,030
All right.

364
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,590
Floor is yours.

365
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,910
So the problem with the afterlife

366
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,459
is not only that it's
cruel, but that it's final.

367
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,129
You get one shot on Earth,

368
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,870
and regardless of the
context of your life,

369
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,590
you're placed somewhere,
usually the Bad Place,

370
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,180
forever with no chance for redemption.

371
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,780
My Neighborhood was
built to torture humans,

372
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,059
but it made them better.

373
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,750
We want to create a system

374
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,930
that works that way intentionally,

375
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,250
a system designed to give
people a fighting chance.

376
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,440
Huh.

377
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,920
Interesting.

378
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,571
Why don't you walk us through it?

379
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:28,819
Yeah, we're gonna, man. Just chill.

380
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,270
Your time on Earth won't be a test

381
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,470
that you either pass or fail,
but instead a class you take,

382
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,289
and the test will come in the afterlife.

383
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,840
The first part stays the same.

384
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,040
You live your life,
screw up a bunch of stuff.

385
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,440
Like, a lot of stuff.

386
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,770
Like, to the point where
people are, like...

387
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,719
this is mess up, even for Florida.

388
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,410
But you can't hear them because
you fell into the swamp

389
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,509
trying to spray paint a Taco
Bell logo on a snapping turtle.

390
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,390
We rest our case, Your Honor.

391
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,229
- No, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, we don't.

392
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,450
We barely started.

393
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,350
So when you die, you still
have a points total,

394
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,470
but in the new system,
that number will serve

395
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,810
as a sort of baseline

396
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,370
to determine how hard or
how easy your test is.

397
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,779
Sorry. I'm just trying
to play catch-up here.

398
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,369
Who's designing these tests, exactly?

399
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,250
A Good Place architect
and a Bad Place architect

400
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,320
will work together to design a scenario

401
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,850
to make you confront
your moral shortcomings,

402
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,920
like Eleanor's selfishness,

403
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,910
Jason's impulsivity,
Chidi's indecisiveness,

404
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,389
and my complete inability
to carry off a mod look.

405
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,170
- That's not...
- I know I have other faults,

406
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,010
but that is a big one.

407
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,519
The test could be anything.

408
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,820
Maybe you show up and you're told

409
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,170
you're in the Good Place,

410
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,229
but you know that it's a mistake.

411
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,040
Maybe the test looks just
like your regular life,

412
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,569
or a twisted version of your life.

413
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,319
You're presented with these challenges.

414
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,520
Do well or badly, at the end,

415
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,950
you're given a sort of evaluation.

416
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,329
Yeah, and the architects
explain what you did badly,

417
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,720
what you did well, and
then you get rebooted

418
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,919
and do it again...

419
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,879
and again and again until you ace it.

420
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,790
Oh, hang on.

421
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,670
It seems to me if y'all get rebooted,

422
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,610
your memories will be wiped out.

423
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,030
How you ever gonna learn anything

424
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,969
if you're always having
to start from scratch?

425
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,349
- Mm-hmm.
- Good point, Timothy Olyphant.

426
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,019
- Tim's fine.
- Okay, great.

427
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,080
In the new system, you
will retain a vague memory

428
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,519
of what you learned in
the evaluation sessions.

429
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,750
That information, what
you did well or badly,

430
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,670
stays with you like...

431
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,650
like a little voice in your head,

432
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,090
helping you become a better
version of yourself.

433
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,280
Okay, that helps. Thank you.

434
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,130
So our guess is that
with enough chances,

435
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,200
people will eventually
make enough good choices

436
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,620
to qualify for the Good Place,
and maybe some never will,

437
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,169
but that's okay because
everyone gets a fair shot.

438
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,740
Hold the phone. What are my
demons doing this whole time?

439
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,640
I have millions of lava
monsters down there

440
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,080
who will be out of a job.

441
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,130
I ask you, into whose throats

442
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,470
are they supposed to pour lava?

443
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,810
Well, bad news is no more throat lava

444
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,269
or penis flattenings.

445
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,890
Then what are we doing to their penises?

446
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,600
Well, largely, ignoring them.

447
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,790
You guys are hearing this.
I'm not crazy, right?

448
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,189
No, I mean, it's a fair question.

449
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,029
Whose side are you on, man?

450
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,300
I don't have a dog in
this fight, little lady.

451
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,770
I'm just looking for clarity.

452
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,619
Shawn, you'll all still have jobs.

453
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:22,700
Bad place architects
help design the test.

454
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,619
Rank and file demons, they'll play-role

455
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,959
just like they did in my
original Neighborhood.

456
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,131
And remember how much fun
you had playing the Judge?

457
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,550
I don't know, guys.
You think this will work?

458
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,310
It sort of already has.

459
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,830
Chidi just had 800 versions of himself

460
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,469
stuffed into his soul at the same time.

461
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,679
I mean, he's a new man.
He's way cooler now.

462
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,059
I like the old version,
too, but not as much.

463
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,490
It's not just Chidi, Your Honor.

464
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,250
When I started in Michael's
first Neighborhood,

465
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,470
I was nothing more than a
PalmPilot in a cool vest.

466
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,069
But look at me now.

467
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,540
I can hold four humans in my void,

468
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,569
and conjure Timothy Olyphant
in the blink of an eye.

469
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,279
Getting rebooted over and over made me

470
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,680
a better not-a-person
than I've ever been.

471
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,869
Humans should get the same opportunity.

472
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,420
Well?

473
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,660
Mm...

474
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,970
pass.

475
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,389
Well, guys, I really thought you had it.

476
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,520
It has been a genuine pleasure, sweetie.

477
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,760
Oh.

478
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:34,210
♪ Gonna erase the Earth ♪

479
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,180
♪ Erase the Earth ♪

480
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,989
I hid the clicker as
far away as possible,

481
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,569
but we are seconds away.

482
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,810
I'm so sorry, guys.

483
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,910
Where did Shawn go?

484
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,579
Oh, don't bother.
He's just toying with us.

485
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,150
I know. That's what gives me hope.

486
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,169
Had to do it one last time before
all this goes away for good.

487
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,419
So what are you offering me now?

488
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,810
Nothing. It's over.
That was our last idea.

489
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,830
Good.

490
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,830
Soon, all your precious
humans will be gone.

491
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah. It's too bad.

492
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,090
Well, congrats, bud. You won.

493
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,599
See you in a billion years.

494
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,570
When the humans evolve again,

495
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,430
I'll be right back at
your throat, you traitor.

496
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,810
I mean, yeah, I know.

497
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,656
That's why I said, "See
you in a billion years."

498
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,430
Wait.

499
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,992
I'm gonna do the evil speech now.

500
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,029
If you want.

501
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,170
Since the dawn of time,

502
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,010
good and evil have waged a
furious battle, stemming from...

503
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,900
this feels stupid if you're
not gonna fight back.

504
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,450
How do you not have another plan?

505
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,039
You've always had another plan.

506
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,507
What's wrong, Shawn?

507
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,130
Okay, fine.

508
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,860
Gonna make me admit it.

509
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,060
Fighting you is the
most fun I've ever had.

510
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,460
I mean, you know.

511
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,000
You corkscrew your first eyeball,

512
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,230
and you're like, man, I can't believe

513
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,470
they're paying me to do this.

514
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,050
By the trillionth, it's like...

515
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,519
I should've just been a teacher.

516
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,850
And then you go and get the warm fuzzies

517
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,363
about your little humans,
and something...

518
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,830
something changed.

519
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,410
I was having fun again.

520
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,029
I'm not sure I'm ready for that to end.

521
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,369
I know, buddy. It's
hard when things end.

522
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,180
But one way or the other, this is over.

523
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,881
The only question is... what's next?

524
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,860
I heard your speech at Demon-Con.

525
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,259
You know this system stinks.

526
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,589
You wouldn't have let me try
the original experiment

527
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,891
if things were working.

528
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,250
Let's try a new way...

529
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,269
together.

530
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,010
Okay, finally.

531
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,649
For the last time, I, the
Judge of the afterlife...

532
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,590
Hang on, Your Honor.

533
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,029
Are you kidding me?

534
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,130
Can't a gal just end all
of humanity one time

535
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,410
without everyone getting
all up on her junk?

536
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,619
What is it, man?

537
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,980
Shawn has agreed to our proposal.

538
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,039
Wait, seriously?

539
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,369
In principle, yes.

540
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,030
Still some kinks to work in...

541
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
- Out.
- Out.

542
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,600
Sorry. Old habits.

543
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,210
But I think we can find
a way to make it work.

544
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,250
Guys, watch this.

545
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,140
Sorry.

546
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,719
Jeez.

547
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,040
Okay, well,

548
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,250
assuming we are redesigning
the entire afterlife

549
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,550
according to this plan...

550
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,010
what do we do first?

551
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,810
Oh, don't look at me. I'm...

552
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,189
I'm just the idea guy.
