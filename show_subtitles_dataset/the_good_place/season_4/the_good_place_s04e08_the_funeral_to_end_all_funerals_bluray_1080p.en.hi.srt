1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,880
The Judge says no one gets unfrozen

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,100
until she's ruled on the case.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,400
Oh, humans have to stay here.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,829
- You can't see the numbers.
- Hang on.

5
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,600
I worked my ash off
running this neighborhood

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,619
for a full year,

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,039
and I'm not even allowed
to hear how we did?

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,669
Yes. And here's a bottle of tequila.

9
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,080
Okay, let us know how it goes.

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,030

11
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,940
Regardless of what the Judge rules,

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,830
this feels like some sort of good-bye.

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,860
Even if we succeeded,
there's no guarantee

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,059
she'll keep us together.

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,360
She might just snap her fingers

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,109
and send us flying into
different dimensions.

17
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,890
How was that? Did I cheer everyone up?

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,840
Aw, man, are we gonna die again?

19
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,810
We've died so many times.

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,420
We've probably had, like,
15 funerals by now.

21
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,810
It's getting annoying.

22
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,950
If it would cheer you up,

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,680
I could tell you what happened
at your original funerals.

24
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,789
Tahani, Moby spoke first.
He claimed that...

25
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,050
Uh, please stop.

26
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,549
I don't want to hear it.

27
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,620
what about mine?

28
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,900
Your friends didn't say things about you

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,759
so much as they graffitied
a Red Lobster about you.

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,860
Yeah, in Jacksonville,

31
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,300
that's the first stage of grief.

32
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,670
In Arizona, you can either
have a regular funeral,

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,480
or they can put your body
out on a shooting range,

34
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,939
and you get a $200 state tax credit.

35
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,120
Hang on.

36
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,819
This is how we take our minds
off the Judge's ruling.

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,140
Let's throw ourselves the funeral

38
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,850
to end all funerals.

39
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,980
Awesome.

40
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,460
And you know what they say in Florida:

41
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,039
"If you don't like this
funeral, just wait a minute."

42
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,530
Ugh. The Judge's chambers.
I hate this place.

43
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,560
What's the wi-fi password?
There is no service.

44
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,290
Shawn.

45
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,339
Michael.

46
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,179
Bounces of me, and sticks to you.

47
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,130
Wait. No, I messed that up.

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,920
First, say something mean to me,

49
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,750
really cruel, something
that just guts me.

50
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,880
You're totally gonna be glue.

51
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,200
So it's come to this.

52
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,220
We have finally arrived at the end

53
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,550
of your pathetic attempt
to prove that humans

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,100
are more than just
mobile turd factories,

55
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,980
and you are going to fail again

56
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,190
because that is what you do.

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,900
You're a choker, Michael.

58
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,890
And you're about to choke
for the last time...

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,570
except for the eternity
you're going to spend

60
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,700
in the Bad Place being choked by me,

61
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,590
who will be doing the choking.

62
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,080
Well, you're glue.

63
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,940
Wow.

64
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,940
- Look at this place.
- Beautiful.

65
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,340
The floor.

66
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,349
Hello, Good Place committee.
Thank you for coming.

67
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,840
No, thank you, Michael.

68
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,340
You did an incredible job,

69
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,090
maybe the best job that
anyone's ever done at any task.

70
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,880
But you don't know how we did.

71
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,060
We might not know how you did,

72
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,890
but we know you did great.

73
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,190
And Shawn, before we even
find out what happened,

74
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,700
we want you to know
we're willing to give up

75
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,869
all our leverage, compromise,
and meet you halfway.

76
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,489
I met your mom halfway last night.

77
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,409
So colorful!

78
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,670
We are here to celebrate the afterlife

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,310
of Tahani Al-Jamil,

80
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,879
in the place she felt most comfortable,

81
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,880
the cabin of a Gulfstream
G650 private jet.

82
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,640
Tahani was super nice,

83
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,980
and she deserved for people

84
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,390
to be nicer to her than they were.

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,200
The only sad thing is that

86
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,269
she never got over her
speech impediment.

87
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,160
Tahani improved so much
over her many lives,

88
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,640
but she also helped me improve.

89
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,720
She taught me lots of stuff,

90
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,040
like bras shouldn't be painful,

91
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,100
and you don't buy bras at Home Depot,

92
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,940
and they don't sell bras at Home Depot.

93
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,320
What the hell are you wearing?

94
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,480
For the record,

95
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,540
it was a men's back support harness,

96
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,870
and it worked in a pinch.

97
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,620
She was the best friend I ever had...

98
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,829
and I loved her.

99
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,220
Oh, thank you so much.

100
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,620
That was wonderful.

101
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,780
I wish Chidi was here.

102
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,509
It sucks that he's too dead
for these Heaven funerals.

103
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,700
Can someone grab his arm?

104
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,760
My hands are kind of full with his butt.

105
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,380
How'd he get so jacked?

106
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,270
When he was 14, someone told him that

107
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,060
exercise alleviated anxiety,

108
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,340
and he started doing pushups
and basically never stopped.

109
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,899
All right, everyone.

110
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,880
Let's get this done.

111
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,450
This is the single most important case

112
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,239
that has ever appeared in my court,

113
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,079
and the results will have
ramifications for eternity.

114
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,980
Before we begin,

115
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,790
I'm going to need you all to sign this.

116
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,230
A petition to bring back "Ally McBeal."

117
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,249
Well, yeah.

118
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,910
I mean, everything else
is getting rebooted.

119
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,750
Get a young hottie in there,
you know, like a Zendaya type.

120
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,290
Is it Zendaya or Zendaya?

121
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,460
Zendaya.

122
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,759
Or... I don't...

123
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,099
I mean, who wouldn't watch that?

124
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,809
Am I right? Anyone?

125
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,040
Fine.

126
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,729
Take it away, Matt.

127
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,100
Okay, the moment we've
all been waiting for.

128
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,649
The test results that dictate
the future of humanity.

129
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,149
Here we go. In 30, 29...

130
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,029
Two, one.

131
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,280
Voil?

132
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,199
I thought this would be fun.

133
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,199
Had a lot of time alone in there.

134
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,000
Bam!

135
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,120
Simone got 12% better
than she was on Earth.

136
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,160
Bam! Chidi got 26% better.

137
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,670
Bam! John got 44% better.

138
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,590
Shoot.

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
Shouldn't have committed
so hard to this "bam" thing.

140
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,220
Funeral!

141
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,170
Jason, at the risk of getting an answer

142
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,910
that might thoroughly depress me,

143
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,649
what made you choose this setting?

144
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,880
There's a Jacksonville tradition

145
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,550
of having your funeral
where you were born.

146
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,300
I got born in the deep end of a pool

147
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,280
right after my mom did a cannonball.

148
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,920
Well, I knew the risks.

149
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,540
You never really talk about your mom.

150
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,620
Yeah, she died when I was pretty young.

151
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,830
I lost her to the big C.

152
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,190
That's what we called the crocodile

153
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,630
that lived by my house.

154
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,849
I'm just playing. It was cancer.

155
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,050
Watch me do a handstand.

156
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,299
Jason Mendoza didn't have an easy life.

157
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,440
He once told me the
closest he'd ever gotten

158
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,510
to having a pi? ata on his birthday

159
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,420
was when a seagull ate too many condoms

160
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,639
on the beach and exploded.

161
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,180
But despite it all,

162
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,080
he was the most optimistic
person I'd ever met.

163
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,600
Jason was the very first person

164
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,109
to ask me about my feelings.

165
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,260
I hadn't had any yet,

166
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,980
but it made me want to go get some.

167
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,340
I could see something special inside him

168
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,230
that no one else could see.

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,700
It was a multi-colored blob

170
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,329
of positivity right behind his sternum.

171
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,690
That's my Jason,

172
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,100
a big, colorful, rainbow blob

173
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,789
stuffed inside a hot,
life-size action figure.

174
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,089
Plus, I gotta say it was nice
to have a true dirtbag buddy

175
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:41,679
so I could talk about what
really mattered in life.

176
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,139
Wrestling, semi-legal
drugs, and Jason Statham.

177
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,590
Statham forever!

178
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,280
Indeed.

179
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,380
Statham forever.

180
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,610
Amen.

181
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,800
Amen.

182
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,340
Let's focus on the big picture here.

183
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,390
Free of Earth's complications

184
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,820
and its unintended consequences,

185
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,060
the other three improved a lot.

186
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,720
Chidi got 38% more confident.

187
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,030
Simone got 43% more flexible
in her judgments of people,

188
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,370
and John didn't call one
single person the C-word.

189
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,490
But he did yell the C-word at himself

190
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,590
as well as a pack of squirrels

191
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,429
and a chair he tripped over.

192
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,719
Why are we even still discussing this?

193
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,589
Brent got worse.

194
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,929
If humans can't be good with
their needs magically met,

195
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,630
maybe they're just not that good.

196
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,600
He's right; the evidence
needed to be overwhelming.

197
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,180
I can't just turn the whole
afterlife upside down

198
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,610
because three people
got a little bit better.

199
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,110
But don't forget. There's a
lot of evidence that Eleanor,

200
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,850
Jason and Tahani got better
in the original experiment,

201
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,990
so that's six people.

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,050
That's the number of
friends in "Friends."

203
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,470
Are you gonna sit there and
say that every single Friend

204
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,079
belongs in hell? I mean,

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,960
maybe Ross and Rachel,
and Monica and Joey,

206
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,890
and definitely Chandler...

207
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,379
but Phoebe?

208
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,580
Face it, Michael. You lost.

209
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,710
Everything you've done, this experiment,

210
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,050
the original Neighborhood,

211
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,009
sending your little cockroach
buddies back to Earth,

212
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,049
all of it was for nothing.

213
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,049
Bam. You're glue.

214
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,460
Actually, Shawn,

215
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,210
that's a very interesting point.

216
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,389
Exactly. What?

217
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,870
Matt, call up the active files

218
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,740
of four people still alive on Earth,

219
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,269
Kamilah Al-Jamil, Donna Shellstrop,

220
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,600
and her stepdaughter Patricia,

221
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,100
and Steven Peleaz, AKA Pillboi.

222
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,350
They were not part of the experiment.

223
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,100
If he gets to bring in
random good people into it,

224
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,880
I should be able to bring
in random bad people.

225
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,980
Call up Elizabeth Holmes.

226
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,940
No, Henry Kissinger. No...

227
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,699
PewDiePie.

228
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,690
Your honor, the people I want
to look at are not random.

229
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,789
They're four humans

230
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,789
the cockroaches helped on Earth.

231
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,060
No magic. Just... just kindness.

232
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,539
And I bet their emotional support

233
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,429
made those four people better.

234
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,719
And I'm wrong,

235
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,140
I'll be the first to say...

236
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,549
we're glue.

237
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,040
I don't think any of you
is using that right,

238
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,300
but, fine, let's see it.

239
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,170
Look. Right there.

240
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,310
After we intervened,

241
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,189
Pillboi dedicated himself
to caring for the elderly.

242
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,240
Kamilah started a scholarship
in Tahani's name

243
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,890
that sent 213 women to college.

244
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,260
Donna started doing homework
with Patricia every night,

245
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,699
and that little girl...

246
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,000
actually ended up teaching
Donna multiplication.

247
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,400
Yikes.

248
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,940
Look, the point is people improve

249
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,700
when they get external love and support.

250
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,330
How can we hold it against
them when they don't?

251
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,250
Need I remind you that Brent
got worse with every second

252
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,290
of every moment of every day.

253
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,679
Until right at the end.

254
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,500
With 10 seconds left, he swung way up.

255
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,780
This is it, your honor.

256
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,080
This is the whole story.

257
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,770
No one is beyond rehabilitation.

258
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,610
Brent spent a year being
an absolute diaper load

259
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,230
of a human being, and the
points total tells you that.

260
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,410
But what that number can't tell you...

261
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,500
is who he could've become tomorrow.

262
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
I'll have my ruling shortly.

263
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,960
Okay, Janet, where do you
want to go for your funeral?

264
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,150
Dave and Buster's, probably?

265
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,860
You probably want to go
to Dave and Buster's.

266
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,740
I think I heard her say
Dave and Buster's,

267
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,179
so let's just go there.
We can sort it out later.

268
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,650
It's nice that you want
to honor me, but...

269
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,680
you've already given me so much.

270
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,020
Tahani taught me that
you can make a family,

271
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,689
even if you never really had one.

272
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,030
Jason taught me I have value

273
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,609
beyond what I do for other people.

274
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,110
And Eleanor...

275
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,990
there was a moment on Earth
when all hope was lost,

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,119
and I watched you have hope anyway.

277
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,450
Just thinking about that

278
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,419
makes me want to barf
up a beautiful quasar.

279
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,160
Well said, Janet.

280
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,490
That means it's your turn, Eleanor.

281
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,830
All right. Mine's easy.

282
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,089
We don't even have to move.

283
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,009
I stand here before you,

284
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,530
in sweatpants for the first time ever,

285
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,889
to celebrate Eleanor Shellstrop

286
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,670
in a place where she
spent much of her life,

287
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,439
a bar in a house she was not invited to.

288
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,640
Eleanor was full of surprises.

289
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,640
I never knew if she was going
to ruthlessly make fun of me,

290
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,080
or totally objectify me in
a way that was flattering,

291
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,100
and also vaguely problematic.

292
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,529
- Well...
- But whether she was lifting me up

293
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,990
or calling me out...

294
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,950
I never felt quite so
seen as when she saw me.

295
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,410
Eleanor, I know you don't like it

296
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,830
when people get all emotional about you,

297
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,380
so I channeled all of my
love for you into this song.

298
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,729
That's when the foam cannons go pshh!

299
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,439
Explode outward!

300
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,650
And then back to the song.

301
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,850
Okay, okay, we're good.

302
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,520
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

303
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,570
Okay, who's left?

304
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,989
We are here to celebrate the afterlife

305
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,989
of Chidi Anagonye.

306
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,370
Eleanor, would you like
to say a few words?

307
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,490
Chidi was a...

308
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,780
rootin', tootin', rackin'
frackin' varmint.

309
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,980
Sorry, I don't know why I just went

310
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:10,630
full Yosemite Sam, there. Um...

311
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,020
yeah, I don't think I can...

312
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,350
do this. I... I can't just sum up

313
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,530
all of my feelings about Chidi,

314
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,850
so I'm gonna pass.

315
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,530
The Judge is about to make her ruling.

316
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,899
She wants us to be there to hear it.

317
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,430
Oh, we should probably change outfits.

318
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,859
Tahani's sweatpants say
"skank army" on the butt.

319
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,319
They do?

320
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,449
Michael...

321
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:35,860
you came to me and said the
points system was flawed,

322
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,860
a system that has been in
place since the dawn of time

323
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,830
and has judged every soul that
has ever walked the earth.

324
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,630
And I have come to the conclusion...

325
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,000
that you're right.

326
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,750
- I'm...
- You're right.

327
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,790
Humans are not fixed at
one level of morality.

328
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,230
They can always get better,

329
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,630
which means the points system
does not accurately judge

330
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,610
how good or bad they are.

331
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,850
You won.

332
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,940
Well...

333
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,119
that wasn't so hard now, what it?

334
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,790
We did it! We did it!

335
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,230
The universe owes you
a debt of gratitude

336
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,419
for bringing this to my attention.

337
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,370
Now, in terms of how we
handle this moving forward,

338
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,530
obviously, Earth is cancelled.

339
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,390
Buhh...

340
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,630
Earth is what, now?

341
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,830
All humans on Earth

342
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,099
and in the afterlife
will be extinguished,

343
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,670
and we will start the entire
human race over from scratch.

344
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,290
And you know what's so funny?

345
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,820
In a very roundabout way,

346
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,840
I am actually rebooting "Ally McBeal"

347
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,100
because I'm rebooting everything.

348
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,480
Anyway,

349
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,110
congrats, Michael. You won.

350
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,840
Whoa, whoa, your honor.

351
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,630
Let's just slow down here,

352
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,290
and say everything again maybe,

353
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,880
because I think some of us

354
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,400
were thinking about skateboards

355
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,439
and don't know what's going on.

356
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,290
Canceling Earth... but
doesn't seem a bit drastic?

357
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,110
It's just too much of a
mess down there, you know?

358
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,740
I mean, the simplest solution
is to erase everyone

359
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,600
that ever lived and restart

360
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,040
with a bunch of amoebas or whatever.

361
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,030
Then human life will evolve again,

362
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
or maybe even something better.

363
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,880
Maybe this time they won't
have baby teeth, you know?

364
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,060
That whole thing is so
weird, like they fall out

365
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,579
and then the bigger teeth just
grow out of that same hole.

366
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,820
Gross.

367
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,620
Anyway, the important thing is Earth...

368
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,060
How are you guys surprised?

369
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,340
I mean, what did you think
was gonna happen if you won?

370
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,960
I don't know. I thought
we could just give, like,

371
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,370
give three points for eating
an apple instead of two.

372
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes, why can't we just
tweak the points a little?

373
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,410
Just, you know, a little boost,
like Spanx, but for your soul.

374
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
- Yes.
- Guys,

375
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,450
the problem isn't the points.

376
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,010
It's that Earth has
become too complicated

377
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,609
for the points to reflect the
value of human behavior.

378
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,229
Remember? The whole
thing you discovered?

379
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,199
And now I have no choice but to fix it.

380
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,730
Where did I put that human
wiper outer thingy?

381
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,620
Lip gloss, lip gloss, thing
that ends all the wars,

382
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,160
"Justified" season two.

383
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,869
Wow, you won.

384
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,580
And you still somehow failed.

385
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,590
Classic.

386
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,360
Wake Chidi up. Now.

387
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,870
We need all the help we can get.

388
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,480
You really want me to wake him up,

389
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,779
just to tell him that
he and everyone else

390
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,389
in the universe is going
to cease to exist?

391
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,130
Not when you say it like that.

392
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,729
Well, what...

393
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,059
The Good Place nerds. Our only hope.

394
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,100
- Oh, wait, I, you know...
- Yo, yo, yo, angel types,

395
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,439
if you are ever gonna do something,

396
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,600
you gotta do it now.

397
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,960
Oh, you bet we're gonna do something.

398
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,560
This has gone too far.

399
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm composing some very
sternly worded letters.

400
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,120
Are we sure stern is the right tone?

401
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,909
We don't want to seem strident.
It upsets the norms.

402
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,189
You're absolutely right.

403
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,239
I apologize... and resign,
effective immediately.

404
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,819
So bold. I am so proud of you.

405
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,570
Here it is. Great.

406
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,360
Michael, Shawn, Janet,

407
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,210
see you in maybe a billion years.

408
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,759
It has been one crazy ride, you guys.

409
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,360

410

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,640

416
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,120
Okay.

417
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,200
Bye, y'all.

418
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,730
Janet, what the hell? Give it back.

419
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,820
No, it's in my void,
and you can't have it.

420
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,749
I don't say "no" a lot.
Did I pronounce that right?

421
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,169
Janet, you give me back my thingy,

422
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,080
or I will go into your
void and get it myself.

423
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,289
I'd like to see you try.

424
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,660
Oh, okay. She's trying right now.

425
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,960
She's in my void.

426
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,740
It feels... it feels weird.

427
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,210
Yikes. Whoa. Okay.

428
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,500
Real cute, honey. Where is it?

429
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,510
What do you mean?

430
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,849
- It's not in my void?
- No.

431
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,800
It's in mine.

432
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:07,260
Ugh. I feel like such a
wiener hole saying this,

433
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,260
but Michael wrote a manifesto,

434
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,850
and I read it on the toilet.

435
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,440
I don't have to poop. I choose to.

436
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,949
Anyway, I'm with them now.

437
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,440
Are you kidding me?

438
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,960
Oh, get over yourself, you dork.

439
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,490
The whole system is royally effed.

440
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,400
Humans suck...

441
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,820
but this isn't their fault.

442
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,260
You read what I wrote
and it got through to you?

443
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,830
Yeah, but I also used the
pages to wipe my butt,

444
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,710
so don't pop a stiffy just yet.

445
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,210
Mm-kay?

446
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,719
- Ugh.
- I am so proud of you.

447
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,969
I don't care.

448
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,139
I think you do a little bit.

449
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,810
Whoo! Sister hug.

450
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,309
Okay, get off me. Ew, ew, ew, ew.

451
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,809
Hey, listen up.

452
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,399
I made an official ruling,
and I am not going to see it

453
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,520
undone by two Janets playing keep-away.

454
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,800
Oh, I should've explained.

455
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,649
It's not two of us.

456
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,730
It's all of us.

457
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,150
- Hi!
- What up, nerds?

458
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,619
- Hello.
- Eat my farts, losers.

459
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,829
I am here for a certain
reason and no other reasons.

460
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,420
- What up, fart-knockers?
- Hi!

461
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,960
- Hello.
- What it is? What it is?

462
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,110
What up, dorks?

463
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,780
Sent the manifesto around
to all the other Janets.

464
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,760
We have a group text now.

465
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,380
I mostly send gifs of otters.

466
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,220
This is so annoying!

467
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,830
Okay, Janets.

468
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,949
You want to do this the hard way?

469
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,439
I am gonna search your voids one by one.

470
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,979
And then marbleize you one by one

471
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,449
until I get my stupid Earth
rebooter thingy back.

472
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,140
We're not gonna be able
to hold her off forever.

473
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,770
We need a plan.

474
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,500
Okay, so what's the plan?

475
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,720
Plan, plan, plan.

476
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,580
Step one, get a plan.

477
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,880
Step two, do the plan.

478
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,870
Yeah, yeah. This is working.

479
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,800
- Michael, focus.
- Right, sorry. Uh...

480
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,270
all right, so if we can't
change the points,

481
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,750
then maybe we can change
what we do with the points.

482
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,960
Yeah, we just need a brand new system

483
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,170
for judging humans in the afterlife.

484
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,900
We can do this, right?

485
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,400
Yeah, but in order to crack it,

486
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,090
I think you know what needs to happen.

487
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,840
There is literally only one person here

488
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,189
who is smart enough

489
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,810
and thoughtful enough to save humanity.

490
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,060
Fine. I'll do it.

491
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,989
Not you, dummy.

492
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,480
Designing a better afterlife

493
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,880
is the ultimate ethical question.

494
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,329
Chidi spent his entire existence

495
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,870
pondering the biggest questions.

496
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,000
He is brilliant and empathetic.

497
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,960
All he cares about is how
best to treat other people,

498
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,299
and he is willing to sacrifice
his own happiness to do it.

499
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,139
If we're gonna pull this off,

500
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,960
we need Chidi back, and
he needs his memories.

501
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,860
You want to take the most
indecisive man ever born,

502
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:04,210
stuff him full of over 800
different versions of himself,

503
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,080
and then tell him he has, like,
45 minutes to save humanity?

504
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,029
You think that will go well?

505
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,849
I don't know how it's gonna go.

506
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,569
But he is our only chance,

507
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,989
and it is now or literally never.

508
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,660
Wake him up.

509
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,370
Not in this Janet. Next.
