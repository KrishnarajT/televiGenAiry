1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,879
As you reach the end of your
first year in the afterlife,

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,650
what do you remember most?

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,990
The everlasting friendships you made?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,939
The adversity you overcame together?

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,230
The day everything was chocolate?

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,790
That day was awesome.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,590
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,400
It was all chocolate.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,410
Shh, shh, shh.

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,830
You only have a few hours
left in your first year,

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,190
so why not do as many amazing
good deeds for other people

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,590
as you possibly can by
midnight just in case?

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,839
I know. I know. All
right, I'll take it out.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,259
I'm a little tired, okay?

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,480
- Lay off.
- That movie, minus the part

16
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,139
where Eleanor gives away
the entire experiment,

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,110
will play before the party tonight.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,870
Speaking of which, the theme is

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,729
"One Year Down, Infinity to Go."

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,809
Dress is London black tie.

21
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,140
That means Knightsbridge
black tie, not Kensington

22
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,370
or, heaven forbid, West Brompton.

23
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,960
Can you imagine?

24
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,400
No.

25
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,730
Also, just after midnight,

26
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,600
in order to reset my processing power,

27
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,110
I will be violently
eating my Janet babies.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,119
I'd advise no one look directly at me.

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,329
Copy that. So tonight at the party,

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,459
we're gonna go for one more point grab.

31
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,830
I'm gonna suggest that they
make toasts about each other,

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,050
celebrate their ups and downs,
demonstrate personal growth,

33
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,889
blah, blah, blah, humanity is saved.

34
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,770
One more day, guys. Let's finish strong.

35
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,690
And to that end, as you might know,

36
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,720
I've been practicing human magic.

37
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,710
Oh.

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,769
Ta-da.

39
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,300
Dope.

40
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,779
So I was thinking...

41
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,770
No, the Magnificent Dr. Presto

42
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,900
is not performing tonight.

43
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,239
- Come on, I...
- Dude, magic is always lame.

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,409
But it's especially lame here,

45
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,909
where there's actual magic.

46
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,119
As a counterargument, check your pocket.

47
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,160
The other one.

48
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,830
Oh, shoot, sorry.

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,890
It's my pocket.

50
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,290
Ta-da.

51
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,570
Dope.

52
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,339
You know what? You can perform.

53
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,340
- Really?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,050
You changed my mind
with that pocket thing.

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,930
Oh, boffo.

56
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,920
- Oh, you're being mean.
- Yep.

57
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,899
- Synced & corrected by MementMori -
www.addic7ed.com ...

58
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,890
I am very excited for tonight.

59
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,730
And dare I say,
you all look so splendid,

60
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,869
you could work the coat
check at the Met Gala.

61
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,970
Ooh, speaking of the Met Gala,

62
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,600
remember that security cam footage

63
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,110
of Solange and Jay-Z
fighting in the elevator?

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,810
I learned to read lips.
Turns out, she was yelling,

65
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,340
"No fair, I wanted to be the
one to push the button."

66
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,299
So, uh, yeah, it wasn't as juicy

67
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,720
as some people maybe thought it was.

68
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,730
Hey, gang.

69
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,310
Had a pretty good round today.
Better close this door.

70
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,360
I don't want all those birdies
to follow me in here.

71
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,750
Why?

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,870
Okay, Brent, hurry up and change

73
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,889
so we can get to the party.

74
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,689
Oh, right, hang on.
Uh, Janet gave me this.

75
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,479
Tuxedo in a can.

76
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,990
Ooh, you know, I came
this close to firing Janet,

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,440
but she's gotten a lot better.

78
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,050
Okay, we're not leaving yet.

79
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,530
I need to show you all something.

80
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,540
This is the result of
months of observation.

81
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,880
Now, I know you're
gonna think I'm crazy.

82
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,760
No, why would we think that?

83
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,389
But there is something wrong
with this neighborhood.

84
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,220
And it involves the people in this room.

85
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,910
So crazy that we're at
the end of this thing

86
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,090
and we have no idea how we did.

87
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,680
Janet, any chance you could
get a look inside that obelisk?

88
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,220
Check that magic scoreboard?

89
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,760
There is a chance, yes.

90
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,380
About 1 in 970 trillion.

91
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,159
Let's give her a whirl.

92
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,920
It did not work.

93
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,289
I'll be right back.

94
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,690
Ugh!

95
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,869
I feel okay about most
of it, but I just wish

96
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,740
we had one concrete sign
that Brent has improved.

97
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,749
One moment where he bumps into someone

98
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,789
and sincerely says, "Oops, my bad."

99
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,910
You know? I would kill
for an "oops, my bad."

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,950
Who's a girl gotta fork
to get an "oops, my bad"?

101
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,350
Hey, hey, hey, panicking
about this experiment

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,870
at crucial moments is kind of my move.

103
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,880
- Don't fall apart on me, now.
- I won't.

104
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,150
It's just... you know me.

105
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,190
On Earth, I never played
a game unless I knew

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,420
I could either win or bribe the ref

107
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,510
so he'd throw it for me.

108
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,439
And if we lose, I'm gonna be so mad.

109
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,399
- Ugh!
- Just one more day.

110
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,430
We're gonna stick to the plan,
not do anything radical.

111
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,130
Though we could do something...

112
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,699
Ah, magical.

113
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,069
You gotta let it go, man.

114
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,410
She's right.

115
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,160
I've been suspicious about
this place since day one.

116
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,220
Over the last few months,
I've been collecting data,

117
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,280
and now I am positive,
something is truly forked up.

118
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,950
You didn't tell me about
any of this, muffin.

119
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,800
Okay, you call her muffin?

120
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,890
I'm getting a lot of
breaking news at once here.

121
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,290
I was gathering evidence.

122
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,310
I didn't wanna compromise

123
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,770
the integrity of the data collection.

124
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,510
Oh, so romantic.

125
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,410
Here's what I know.

126
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,010
Eleanor and Michael are up to something,

127
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,389
and it's focused on us.

128
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,670
I mean, there are, like, 300
people in the neighborhood,

129
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,830
and somehow they just
spend all of their time

130
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,510
talking to the six people in this room.

131
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,870
Well, I mean, who else
are they gonna talk to?

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,180
Dumb Shorts Cathy?

133
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,230
What is your problem with her?

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,080
I mean, shorts? "Cathy"?

135
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,740
What isn't my problem with her?

136
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,250
Jianyu, are you okay? You look sweaty.

137
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,159
Oh, no. He's fine.

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,810
He always sweats when he's meditating.

139
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,669
He calls it "sweat-itating."

140
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,379
No, I mean, um,

141
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,879
he doesn't talk, so I call it that.

142
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,330
I'm friends with Sting.

143
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,690
I can't take it anymore.

144
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,759
I know something,

145
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,049
and it's just graduated from hot goss

146
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,429
to relevant AF.

147
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,270
Yes, I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

148
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,470
That's not Jianyu.

149
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,639
His name is Jason.

150
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,710
And he's here by mistake.

151
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,780
Chidi's been helping him hide
and become a better person.

152
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,650
I also knew about this, of course.

153
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,240
Might as well come clean, darling.

154
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,560
Hi, Simone.

155
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,550
Jason Mendoza, Jacksonville, Florida.

156
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
Go, Jags, obviously.
Um, what else about me?

157
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,160
I was born in a swimming pool.

158
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,610
Okay, you never told
me about this, ducky.

159
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
Ducky?

160
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,080
I'm gonna have to sit down.

161
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,549
This is too much.

162
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,710
Well, I swore I wouldn't tell,

163
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,630
and keeping your word is a central tenet

164
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,049
of deontological ethics.

165
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,790
Aw, so romantic.

166
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,170
Okay, let's assume
certain things are odd

167
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,139
about this place. What is your theory?

168
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,620
I don't know.

169
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,363
Maybe this isn't the Good Place.

170
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:24,670
Maybe it's a test.

171
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,650
My best guess, it's some
kind of experiment.

172
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,730
We're being observed in
a closed environment.

173
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,830
Simone, look at this logically.

174
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,050
We are in paradise.

175
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,280
There's fresh air, mountains, Janet.

176
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,200
And yes, some of us are under 5'10",

177
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,390
but other than that,
it is literally perfect here.

178
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,810
No, it is not. Jason is proof.

179
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,000
And if you need more evidence

180
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,670
that this isn't the Good Place,

181
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,340
clearly he's not the only
one who doesn't belong.

182
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,500
Actually, she's right,
and I know it for a fact.

183
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,830
For the first time ever,

184
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,490
I am desperate for you to keep talking.

185
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,060
Well, right at the beginning,
I talked to Mike and Eleanor,

186
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,979
and they were like, "Yeah,
don't tell anyone this,

187
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,030
"but there's a place better than this,

188
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,790
"the Best Place,

189
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,370
and that's where you're headed, amigo."

190
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,830
I don't think they
actually called you amigo.

191
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,190
I had to go through the year here,

192
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
kind of a test, I guess,
which, obviously, I aced.

193
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,860
So at midnight, I'm in the first

194
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,320
Escalade out of here, baby.

195
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,330
- Brent.
- Yeah?

196
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,390
- Think about this.
- Okay.

197
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,570
How could you get into the Best Place?

198
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,300
You would literally have to be

199
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,040
one of the most incredible
people in the universe.

200
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,080
I mean, it makes sense to me.
I don't know what to tell you.

201
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,009
Okay, in the words of Princess Kate

202
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,470
after we came back from
our shopping trip in Ibiza,

203
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,179
"There's a lot to unpack here."

204
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,680
Perhaps we should just
put our concerns aside

205
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,920
and enjoy ourselves.

206
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,250
No way.

207
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,399
We have to figure out exactly
what is going on here.

208
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,149
Okay, just... go to the party,

209
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,899
but keep your eyes open.

210
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,069
I've got a special mission for us.

211
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,609
- Oh, I...
- Oh, good.

212
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,819
Muffin and Ducky are on the case.

213
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,610
- How's it going?
- Awesome.

214
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,810
No, it isn't.

215
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,339
Oh, yeah. Terrible.

216
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,259
Simone knows the neighborhood
isn't what it appears to be.

217
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,030
She's been collecting
evidence for months.

218
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,950
So all that hanging out with Brent

219
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,700
and participating in group activities...

220
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,180
Was under false pretenses.
She was observing him.

221
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,680
She's been observing everything.

222
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,880
Guys, pick a card.

223
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,680
- Yes!
- No time.

224
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,980
The subjects are onto us.

225
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,480
They know something weird is going on,

226
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,909
and it could derail the
entire experiment.

227
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,239
Oh, no!

228
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,830
Oh, sorry, uh, that was unintentional.

229
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,770
What?

230
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,530
There's nothing here.

231
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,710
Did you find anything?

232
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,459
Just some song lyrics
that Michael wrote?

233
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,009
"Here's a trippy little ditty
'bout a train to Groovy City.

234
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,049
"Open up your freaky crystal mind

235
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,590
and we'll have a cosmic good time."

236
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,310
See, that makes me think we're in hell.

237
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,029
Look, we tried to prove your theory,

238
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,549
but it feels like we came up empty.

239
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,250
Chidi, there is so much
evidence they've been lying.

240
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,599
How can you not see that?

241
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,490
Eleanor told me that this
was her first neighborhood.

242
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,040
Maybe some of these are
just honest mistakes.

243
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,860
And also she... told me some other stuff

244
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,149
that I really want to be true.

245
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,649
What kind of stuff?

246
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,070
Well, it was...

247
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,950
something about us.

248
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,490
Why does everything I do fall
apart so close to the end?

249
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,950
My first experiment,
now this experiment.

250
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,990
I only got halfway through writing

251
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,890
"The Purple Train to Groovy City."

252
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,840
I just ran out of creative juice.

253
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,340
Focus. We cannot let
this slip away from us

254
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,410
at the last second.

255
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,720
New plan: forget the toasts.

256
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,340
We do nothing.

257
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,680
We hope that our early successes make up

258
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,640
for the embarrassing mess we've become.

259
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,800
Like Facebook or America.

260
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,240
Okay, sound good? Michael?

261
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,520
We have no way to know

262
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,710
what this really means
for the experiment.

263
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,390
I don't think we can play it safe.

264
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,500
I have a plan. It's risky.

265
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,049
But it might be the only way to get them

266
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,913
to where they need to be.

267
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,150
Do you trust me?

268
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,629
Yeah. Fork it.

269
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,829
Whatever it is, I'm in.

270
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,410
I'm always down for forking it.

271
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,560
- We trust you Michael.
- Then trust...

272
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,930
the Magnificent Dr. Presto.

273
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,230
Man, you cannot pull that hat out

274
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,879
after you ask us if we trust you.

275
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,540
Soul mates?

276
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,420
That's what Eleanor said,
that we're soul mates?

277
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,050
Yep. Pretty neat, huh?

278
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,060
I think it's pretty neat.

279
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,840
Do you think it's pretty
neat, intensely, forever?

280
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,150
Chidi, I really like you.

281
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,229
But I don't think we're soul mates.

282
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,609
Because I don't think soul
mates actually exist.

283
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,430
Right.

284
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,020
Right, right.

285
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,699
- Right?
- Think rationally.

286
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,659
Isn't it weird that she only told
one of us that we're soul mates?

287
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,640
Is it odd? Yes.

288
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,230
Does it mean that Eleanor's
motives are questionable?

289
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,770
Also yes.

290
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,470
But does it suggest that
she wasn't being truthful?

291
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,520
Yes. Okay, I'm starting
to see your point.

292
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,140
Whoa.

293
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,839
What does that mean?

294
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,630
Why is it only four of us?
Why not Tahani and Jason?

295
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,760
Why are there emojis?

296
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,320
I mean, one of them's party hat guy.

297
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,050
I mean, that's good,
right? He's friendly.

298
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,640
It's better than thermometer
guy or angry cat

299
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,840
or smiling poop coil.

300
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,140
Okay, we have to get back to the party

301
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,019
before Eleanor and Michael
notice we're missing.

302
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,360
Great plan. Let's kiss.

303
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,660
Sorry, still thinking about
the soul mate thing.

304
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,149
- Let's go.
- Okay.

305
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,660
Ladies and gentlemen...

306
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,570
I can't believe I'm saying this...

307
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,119
the Magnificent Dr. Presto.

308
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,119
Thank you. Now, I know some of you

309
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,900
may not believe in magic.

310
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,440
Well, I think they
believe in some magic.

311
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,310
Yesterday everybody ate a lollipop

312
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,459
that let them talk to birds.

313
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,419
Okay, but this is Earth magic.

314
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,020
And it's harder.

315
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,750
And if you don't understand that,

316
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,700
I am here...

317
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,320
to change your mind.

318
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,860
Oh, come on.

319
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,390
It started out as a dollar bill

320
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,130
and now it's four quarters.

321
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,479
"Change your mind"?

322
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,970
- Michael, it's three quarters.
- What?

323
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,069
Oh, three quarters.

324
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,940
Three quarters, even harder!

325
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,500
Thank you!

326
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,940
Can you make them clap harder?

327
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,030
They see what they see, man.

328
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
Did you guys find anything?

329
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,850
Yes, proof that the four of us...

330
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,240
and only the four of us...
are being forked with.

331
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,820
But we still don't have any hard proof

332
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,080
that this place is evil

333
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,860
or that Michael and
Eleanor are nefarious,

334
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,800
so, you know, no one's heart
needs to break just yet.

335
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,929
Yeah, I'm with him. This place is fine.

336
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,839
Hey, if you guys don't make
the cut up to the Best Place,

337
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,860
I'll try to put in a good word for you.

338
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,389
- You guys got business cards?
- Brent,

339
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,730
I need a volunteer. Come on up.

340
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,439
Okay, Brent, I want you to
take off your wristwatch

341
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,400
and place it in my hat.

342
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,840
Now, this is a Rolex.

343
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,320
It's the exact same watch
Richie Sambora wears.

344
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,739
- Ah.
- So be careful.

345
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,350
And now the Magnificent Dr. Presto

346
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,350
will transform y...

347
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,060
Oh. Oh.

348
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,669
- Oh, my gosh!
- Whoa! Oh!

349
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,120
No, oh, Brent!

350
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,580
Brent, can you hear me?

351
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,580
If it somehow helps,

352
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,340
there's a small dove in your pocket!

353
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,680
Never mind.

354
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,320
Brent, I'm so sorry.

355
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,940
I must have screwed
up the trick somehow.

356
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,080
Hold on, we're gonna
get you out of there.

357
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,109
Yeah, you better!

358
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,160
I got a hell of a lawsuit on my hands.

359
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,310
I'm gonna frickin' own this place.

360
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,940
- Okay.
- Okay,

361
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,709
everyone, uh, please disperse.

362
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,240
We'll let you know when it's safe.

363
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,020
Uh, you three, stay here.
Keep an eye on Brent.

364
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,629
We're gonna try and fix this remotely

365
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,049
using eternal-being technology.

366
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,212
Tahani, Jianyu, try and find a rope.

367
00:13:36,213 --> 00:13:38,720
- Righto.
- Okay, so what do we do,

368
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,250
try to climb down or wait for the rope?

369
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,020
Neither, we get the fork outta here.

370
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,110
Chidi, a giant hell-hole just opened up

371
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,630
and swallowed one of us.

372
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,480
I don't care what this place really is.

373
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,350
Giant holes are bad, and we should go.

374
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,220
Or giant holes are bad, so
if someone falls into one,

375
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,890
you try to help get him out.

376
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,220
Whoa.

377
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,380
I'm not scared!

378
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm shouting so you know I'm okay.

379
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,060
I am very brave.

380
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,580
Whoo, I hope this works.

381
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,160
We basically just confirmed
that we're lying to them.

382
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,750
Oh, man. Was this a bad idea?

383
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,320
I mean, what if this was a bad idea?

384
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,289
It wasn't, homey. It was a good idea.

385
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,080
Can anyone else weigh in?

386
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,160
I'm serious.

387
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,130
In football, trying to run out the clock

388
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,259
and hoping for the best never works.

389
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,509
It's called "prevent defense."

390
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,600
You don't take any chances

391
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,290
and just try and hang on to your lead.

392
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,610
But prevent defense just
prevents you from winning.

393
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,540
It's always better to try something.

394
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,890
Jason, that was... coherent.

395
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,240
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to.

396
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,980
It's a good plan, Michael.

397
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,880
Hopefully they've bonded enough
as a group to rescue Brent,

398
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,450
call me, get a train, and all
head out of here together.

399
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,450
But was it a mistake
to have Brent fall in?

400
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,200
We could have had Chidi fall in, right?

401
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,010
Or a cute baby panda

402
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,720
or maybe, you know,
like, a box of doughnuts?

403
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,760
Everyone loves doughnuts.

404
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,660
Brent was the right choice.

405
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,080
It's not a tough call
whether to save Chidi

406
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,470
because he's a brilliant and kind person

407
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,500
with a caboose you can
bounce a quarter off of,

408
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,835
and I know because I've done it.

409
00:14:57,836 --> 00:15:01,640
We threw Brent in there
because there is no reason

410
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,380
any of them should help
him because Brent sucks.

411
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,679
Brent is the opposite
of a box of doughnuts.

412
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,010
Toilet full of broccoli.

413
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,180
Yeah, kinda, Brent is
a toilet full of broccoli.

414
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,820
But because he sucks so bad,

415
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,310
if they do risk their
safety to help him,

416
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,420
they'll get more points.

417
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,290
Basically it's a Hail Mary.

418
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,160
It's risky, but if we complete it,

419
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,760
we win the game.

420
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,740
That was two good analogies in a row.

421
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,030
I'm now worried that he's
a demon in a Jason suit.

422
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,620
Are we really in hell?

423
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,780
I mean, I didn't lead a
perfect life on Earth,

424
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,870
but I worked very hard.

425
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,129
Making fun of people
you'd never even met.

426
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,650
Well, I guess you must be right, Simone,

427
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,219
because you always have to be.

428
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,679
Hey, are you the bottom
of a coal-fired pizza?

429
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,260
- Why, 'cause I'm burnt?
- Gah! You are always right.

430
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,729
Well, if it is hell,
I know why I'm here.

431
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,269
Almond milk.

432
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,019
I drank so much of it

433
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,890
despite the negative
environmental impacts.

434
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,360
Okay, wherever we are,
I do not wanna be here

435
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,860
when the clock hits zero, okay?

436
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,660
Now might be our only chance to escape.

437
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,809
Not without Brent.

438
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,300
Do you think if the roles were reversed,

439
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,340
he would waste any time rescuing you?

440
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,840
Maybe. If Elle Macpherson were nearby

441
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,079
and he wanted to impress her

442
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,310
or if he thought that I was
a prince he could ransom...

443
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,440
That's not the point.

444
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,060
He is a person in a hole.

445
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,800
I have a duty to help him get out.

446
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,379
What he would do is irrelevant.

447
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,589
I don't think it is.

448
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,140
If you do a science
experiment a thousand times

449
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,759
and always get the same
results, you move on.

450
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,220
We've given Brent a thousand
chances to be a good person.

451
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,900
In one of them, he was so awful,

452
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,980
you punched him in the face.

453
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,189
Okay, but when I did that,

454
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,230
I thought cutting him out of our group

455
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,280
meant that he would have to find

456
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:43,109
another place in heaven to hang out.

457
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,449
That's changed. I can't just leave him.

458
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,910
Well,

459
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,660
I respect your position.

460
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,289
I respect yours.

461
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,760
Look, I know everything's
really scary right now,

462
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,960
but I just have to say it.

463
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,010
That was the most boring
breakup I've ever seen.

464
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,640
Hey, Chidi, shake it off.

465
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,290
Another bus comes every 15 minutes.

466
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,309
Brent.

467
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,610
Where are they?

468
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,940
They never called a train.

469
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,820
They must have taken Brent's Escalade.

470
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,989
Oh, that's good.

471
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,220
The important thing is
that the group bonded

472
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,400
and stayed together.

473
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,520
Hello! Could someone help us?

474
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,580
- Us?
- Yeah.

475
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,090
This frickin' genius tried
to help me and he fell in.

476
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,340
I thought you were smart, man.

477
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,129
Are you serious right now?

478
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,549
Well, turns out, the group did not bond.

479
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,460
The group snapped in half.

480
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,550
Will you help us?

481
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,480
These rocks are really sharp down here.

482
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,039
- I'm scared.
- I'm not.

483
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,636
- Just give us a second.
- Guys, I think we're cooked.

484
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
It's over.

485
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,280
No, no way. I am not giving up.

486
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,450
I told you, I only play games I can win.

487
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,769
And I played this game,
so that means we can win.

488
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,720
- I don't think that tracks.
- Shut up. What do you know?

489
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,500
Literally everything, but keep going.

490
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,860
I am liking this energy from you.

491
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,820
We have eight minutes left,
so that means we keep trying.

492
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,860
What else can we try?

493
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,119
We've already blown everything up.

494
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,300
We can't blow it up again.

495
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,680
If there's one thing
I know in this world,

496
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,578
it's that you can always blow
up the same thing twice.

497
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,740
He's right.

498
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,499
We have one last move here.

499
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,280
Guys, we are so sorry about your ordeal.

500
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,209
We just have a few questions for you.

501
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,089
Uh, where are John and Simone?

502
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,210
We can't find them.

503
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,580
They left.

504
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,290
- I don't know where they went.
- Typical.

505
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,460
Disloyal jerks.

506
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,200
You know, man, actually,
they really tried with you

507
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,720
and you made it very
hard to be your friend.

508
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,260
You wanna know what happened?

509
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,519
They got jealous

510
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,850
because I'm going to the Best Place.

511
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,470
- They bugged out.
- You're not going to the Best Place!

512
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,760
Don't you get it? They're torturing you.

513
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,359
They're torturing all of us!

514
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,449
Because this is the Bad Place.

515
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,380
Oh, man!

516
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,329
I can't believe you figured it out!

517
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,120
Wait. He's right?

518
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,589
This is the Bad Place?

519
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,580
Yeah. Damn it, he's right.

520
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,960
Yeah, we had a good
run, though, didn't we?

521
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,380
Yeah, we did.

522
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,469
So... no Best Place?

523
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,929
"Oh, so no Best Place?"

524
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,170
Oh, Brent, you big white oaf.

525
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,720
Never change, bud.

526
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,599
Well, I guess we should let him know

527
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,820
you guys are on your way.

528
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,394
- Yeah.
- Wait. On our way where?

529
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:29,760
The actual Bad Place.

530
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,000
They let us toy with you
a little just for kicks,

531
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,930
but now you're going...

532
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,279
And trust me on this.

533
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,250
It's a lot worse.

534
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,160
- Well done.
- Let's hope it works.

535
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,490
We only have a minute left.

536
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,930
Man, crazy twist, huh?

537
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,900
It's like something out
of a Chip Driver novel.

538
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,089
Leave me alone, Brent.

539
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,500
I'm kind of freaking out over here, man.

540
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,780
You're my only real friend.

541
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,810
I'm not your friend.
I don't even like you.

542
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,780
- But you helped me.
- Yeah, I did.

543
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,640
Because I have this stupid moral code

544
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,020
that forces me to help everyone.

545
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,120
But you have never helped anyone

546
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,880
because you don't care
about other people,

547
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,960
which is the bare minimum
that a person has to do,

548
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,260
just care a little about the
other people around you,

549
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,490
and you can't do it.

550
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,739
What are you trying to say here?

551
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,869
You are a bad person.

552
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,170
You can do this.

553
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,170
Come on, dumdum. Faster.

554
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,210
No, I'm not.

555
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,180
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

556
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,509
I'm not a bad person.

557
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,879
I'm not.

558
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,598
I'm a good person!

559
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,090
Oh, man.

560
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,920
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

561
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,149
No, no.

562
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,939
Look, Chidi, whatever happens next,

563
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,530
I, um... I need to say this to you.

564
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,199
All right? I am...

565
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,159
I am so, so sorr...

566
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,490
Sorry.

567
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,679
Eleanor asked me to bring her this

568
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,379
the second the experiment was over.

569
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,110
Well, you know what they say.

570
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,969
It's zero o'clock in the sky somewhere.

571
