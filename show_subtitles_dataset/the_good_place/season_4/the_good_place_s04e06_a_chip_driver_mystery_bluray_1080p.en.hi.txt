00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,246
Wow, she's gonna last.

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,250
Is that your story? It looks boring.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,160
This book is a part of the story.

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,770
You'll see.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,089
It all started about a week ago.

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,300
We had sent the four
humans on a ski trip.

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,910
And they all skied off a cliff

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,410
and they broke all their bones
and their pants fell down

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,130
and you could see their butts.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,180
The end.

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,520
Actually, it went better than
we could have possibly hoped.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,560
Well, I admit it. I was wrong.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,069
- That was so fun.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,290
I mean, I couldn't actually go skiing

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,239
because moving at an angle terrifies me.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,610
But that lodge had so
many reading nooks.

18
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,970
Just everywhere you look, a nook!

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,200
Plus, Jianyu guided us on
that amazing meditation.

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,330
Oh, do you guys want to
share what your mantra is?

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,759
Mine is Cate Blanchett saying "Rihanna."

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,877
Congrats again on the gin rummy win.

23
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,429
I thought I was gonna take you down

24
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,169
because I used to play all
the time back in college.

25
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,419
Oh, you went to Rutgers, right?

26
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,669
No, I went to Princeton.

27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,549
Yeah, I know. I'm messing with you.

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,700
Oh, ha, ha! Nice one!

29
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,820
Hey, you were joking though, right?

30
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,970
You know it's Princeton? Yeah, you know.

31
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, team, well done.

32
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,210
They're all kind of killing it,

33
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,849
but Brent has definitely
made the most progress.

34
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,980
Yeah, when Simone beat him at cards,

35
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,050
he didn't flip the table and storm off.

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,020
He just stormed off. That's big!

37
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,180
Well, we still don't know
if he's really changed

38
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,190
or if he's just trying to
get into Super-Heaven.

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
But his behavior is changing.

40
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,720
Remember, that's the road map.

41
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,540
First, we change the behavior.

42
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,409
Then, we work on motivation.

43
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,900
And now...

44
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,640
- Oh!
- The moment you've all been waiting for.

45
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,460
The Humanity Savior of
the Week goes to...

46
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,830
- Jason!
- Yes!

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,969
Keep up the amazing work with Chidi.

48
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,300
And the award for Hottest
Savior of the Week

49
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,090
goes to...

50
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,210
- Eleanor Shellstrop!
- Whoo!

51
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,559
Thank you, I accept.

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,939
I never win Hottest.

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,519
I don't know what to tell you, man.

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,230
Maybe do some squats?
Pop that booty a little bit?

55
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,480
It was a real high point.

56
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,900
The ski trip, I mean.

57
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,230
Not the completely
rigged hotness contest.

58
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,320
All in all, it was the
best we'd ever felt

59
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:22,489
about the experiment.

60
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,370
And then, Brent did something...

61
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,910
very Brent-y.

62
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,209
Who could have predicted that?

63
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,280
Oh, hey, ski bunnies!

64
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,950
So, great news. I wrote a book.

65
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,960
And since you're my nerdiest friends,

66
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,480
you get to be the first to read it.

67
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,560
"Six Feet Under Par:
A Chip Driver Mystery."

68
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,090
Yeah, it's half spy novel,
half murder mystery.

69
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,620
It's also half submarine adventure,

70
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,479
half erotic memoir,
and half political thriller.

71
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,920
It's also half golf tutorial

72
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,310
and half commentary on society.

73
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,861
So it's 31/2 books in one?

74
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:56,420
At least. So read it ASAP.

75
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,610
I'm having a book-signing party

76
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,900
and I want you to introduce me.

77
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,020
You know, talk about how great it is.

78
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,699
- Oh.
- Party's in two days,

79
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,770
so chop-chop.

80
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,460
Tahani, cancel your plans.

81
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,820
We're gonna split a bottle of wine

82
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,159
and read Brent's
terrible novel out loud.

83
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,249
Oh, dear. Perhaps we shouldn't make fun.

84
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,680
He did seem nicer on the ski trip.

85
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,630
He made us all s'mores.

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,549
Though, to be fair, he did also
claim to have invented them.

87
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,000
Before you defend him,
you might want to check out

88
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,807
Chip Driver's love interest.

89
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,770
Oh, no.

90
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,769
"Her name was Scarlett Pakistan,

91
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,000
"and she was the type of girl

92
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,840
"you couldn't take in
all at once or you'd die.

93
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,650
"You had to take her in bit by bit,

94
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,180
like a great work of
art, like the Louvre."

95
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,020
"Her brown eyes were as brown
as the brownest crayon.

96
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,440
"She had legs like Jessica Rabbit

97
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,829
from that movie."

98
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,240
"Her long, flowing locks
smelled like the moon

99
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,530
at twilight on a par four?"

100
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,740
Ugh, I'm sorry about this.

101
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,220
I've been through worse.

102
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,190
Once, at Elon Musk's birthday party,

103
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,700
I was seated between Silvio Berlusconi

104
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,370
and Elon Musk.

105
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,520
This is bad. Brent and Simone

106
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,960
is our trickiest relationship.

107
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,600
She tends to make snap
judgments about people,

108
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,940
and he's a guy who repeatedly confirms

109
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,330
the accuracy of her snap judgments.

110
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,750
We need her to believe
that Brent is better

111
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,860
than his worst actions,
like saying that Tahani,

112
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,880
"Has an accent like
the Queen of England,

113
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,990
but without any of the
old gross face parts."

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,020
We felt like we could contain
the fallout from Brent's book.

115
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,560
But as is often the
case with these things,

116
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,789
the negative effects
started to ripple out.

117
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,720
Oh, like when someone throws up on a bus

118
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,421
and then someone smells
it, and they throw up?

119
00:04:35,422 --> 00:04:36,959
Sure, yeah.

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,670
- What's wrong, homie?
- Brent wrote this book,

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,919
and clearly, he put some of us in it.

122
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,910
There's a cowardly character
named Four-Eyed Igby

123
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,460
who wears glasses and sweater vests

124
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,980
and never does anything
spontaneous or cool.

125
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,560
I am educating you in ethics.

126
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,890
What could be cooler than that?

127
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,769
If you want to try something
spontaneous, I'm your guy.

128
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,890
Almost everything I did on Earth,

129
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,600
I did without thinking or worrying

130
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,060
about what would happen.

131
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,130
That's how I got my nickname,

132
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,699
"The Defendant."

133
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,030
Not the best argument, but you're right.

134
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,079
What is something spontaneous
that I can do right now?

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,110
Let's come up with a
list of ten possibilities

136
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,329
and then slowly whittle it
down over the next four days.

137
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,370
Better idea: let's dance, baby.

138
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,419
Huh?

139
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,850
Get you out of your head.

140
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,259
This is how we defeat
Igby, the no-fun nerd.

141
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,090
Oh.

142
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,700
- Look at old Igby move!
- There you go.

143
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,809
Yeah, I've never heard
this before. Who is it?

144
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,019
Me, I wrote it.

145
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,269
The song is called,
"I'll Love You Forever,"

146
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,400
parentheses,

147
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,149
"(Make the Bootie Bounce in the Bath)."

148
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,670
Oh, fun fact: the police sirens

149
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,000
in the background are real.

150
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,109
I was being chased as I recorded it.

151
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,310
Okay, okay!

152
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,860
Oh, no.

153
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,909
Oh, my Gaga.

154
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,581
So, obviously, this was
a troubling development.

155
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:55,780
Can you just skip to the end?

156
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,329
No. I need to tell you the whole story.

157
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,500
Why?

158
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,120
Every story about humans
ends the same way.

159
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,610
Just tell me how they screwed up

160
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
and put me out of my misery.

161
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,469
You're judging them too quickly.

162
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,799
Trust me, I've spent a lot more
time with people than you have.

163
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,680
And I know literally everything

164
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,559
that every one of them has ever done.

165
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,849
Do you know what's happening
right now on Earth?

166
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,280
Wars, murders, women in $400 yoga pants

167
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,649
are refusing to vaccinate
their children.

168
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,979
Vindictive nerds at Apple are changing

169
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,399
the charging cable shape again.

170
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,449
Where does this hope come from, man?

171
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,159
This insane hope that people
are worth the trouble.

172
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,199
To quote a terrible song

173
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,160
by a terrible musician

174
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,190
that people love so much
they constantly put it

175
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,820
in terrible movie trailers:

176
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,250
humans are b-b-b-b-bad to the bone.

177
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,330
Well, I think that they're
g-g-g-good sometimes.

178
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,300
And you should give
them the b-b-b-benefit

179
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,940
of the d-d-d-doubt.

180
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,540
Now, where was I?

181
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,150
So, John had just
accidentally discovered

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,523
the truth about Jason.

183
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,569
Keeping a secret like this is exactly

184
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,024
the kind of thing that John
struggled with on Earth.

185
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:06,099
Or to put it in terms you'll understand,

186
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,740
the gossip toilet was about to overflow.

187
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,077
Oh, I do understand that now. Thank you.

188
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,619
So Jianyu is really Jason?

189
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,250
From Florida?

190
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,509
Who else knows about this?

191
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,060
Is it just me?

192
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,580
Is it an exclusive?

193
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,570
Yes, and we have to keep it that way.

194
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,199
If the truth comes out, we have no idea

195
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
what will happen to Jason.

196
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,320
You don't know what you're asking of me.

197
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,730
Look, the neighborhood
is obviously amazing,

198
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,590
but it's also a little season
four of "Downton Abbey."

199
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,630
Beautifully designed,
but a real snooze-fest.

200
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,540
Jason being a mistake

201
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,180
is easily the most exciting thing

202
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,719
that's happened since we got here!

203
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,410
What if, in exchange
for your discretion,

204
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,730
Jason teaches you that
"Magic Mike" body roll thing?

205
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,370
Huh? I mean, you always said

206
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,650
you wanted to learn that.

207
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,260
Fine.

208
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,622
But I want to learn the whole dance.

209
00:07:58,623 --> 00:08:01,180
We hoped Simone would forget
all about Brent's book,

210
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,292
but unfortunately...

211
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,480
"Chip Driver pulled
up to the murder site

212
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,480
"in his 1968 Cadillac.

213
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,530
"'Keep it close' he growled
to the valet, Luis.

214
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,000
"'Of course, Se?or,' said Luis,
who secretly admired Chip

215
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,379
more than even his own father."

216
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,570
"Chip gazed at the sexy outline

217
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,320
"of the murder victim on the floor.

218
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,271
"'What a waste of curves,' he growled.

219
00:08:21,272 --> 00:08:23,106
"He checked his Rolex watch,

220
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:24,380
"which was real.

221
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,389
"It was almost golf o'clock,

222
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,229
"so the case would have to wait.

223
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,050
"Good thing he'd already solved it.

224
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,520
The killer was Luis, the valet."

225
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,260
He solves the murder on page ten.

226
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,538
What is the rest of this book about?

227
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,719
- How's it going, ladies?
- Oh, you know,

228
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,779
just delving into the great
works of literature.

229
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,579
Yeah, so, listen, um...

230
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,500
maybe Brent made some
insensitive choices,

231
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,129
but could you possibly see
your way to forgiving him?

232
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,030
- I suppose...
- No.

233
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,580
No?

234
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,400
Sorry, but no, I can't.

235
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,700
This book is objectifying,
misogynistic, and racist.

236
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,353
Why are we still dealing with
this shirt in the Good Place?

237
00:09:04,354 --> 00:09:06,639
When people like him are ignorant jerks,

238
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,990
why are people like us
asked to forgive him?

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,090
Also, and this is less important,

240
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,900
why is he in a fighter jet
for his author photo?

241
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,820
Well, I can answer the last one.

242
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,230
It's because he loves "Top Gun."

243
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,500
As for the other questions,
I will get back to you

244
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,900
after I consult a number
of immortal beings

245
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,499
who are very wise.

246
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,718
I didn't take you for a linksman.

247
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:34,549
I appreciate golf.

248
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,000
As Ben Hogan once said,

249
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,960
"The most important shot
in golf is the next one."

250
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,680
That's a lovely idea.
If you make a mistake,

251
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,360
you'll always have a
chance to redeem yourself.

252
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,300
Yeah, well, as Jon Daly
once said to David Lee Roth

253
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,639
at the 2002 Chili's Pro-Am in Orlando:

254
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,940
"Suck on this drive, buttmunch."

255
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,130
Ooh!

256
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,180
Nailed it!

257
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,779
That was a flusher, but she sank.

258
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,400
Perhaps an adept linksman like yourself

259
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,360
should play with the
assistance filter turned off?

260
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,700
- Let's play old-school.
- All right.

261
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,890
Why not?

262
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,540
Fork! You sneezed, man.

263
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,263
I don't think I did,
because I literally can't.

264
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:21,860
Well, somebody sneezed. Damn it!

265
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,340
Brent, buddy, nobody sneezed.

266
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,940
You hit a bad shot, and it's fine.

267
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,760
You know, it isn't a sign of weakness

268
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,443
to admit that you screwed up.

269
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:33,689
Fine, whatever. I shanked it.

270
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,410
There you go. Now,
let's go find your ball

271
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,110
and try to do better on your next shot.

272
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,660
And you know, if this ends up applying

273
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,140
to any other aspect
of your life later on,

274
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,360
then cool.

275
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,329
- What?
- What? Nothing.

276
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,760
I gotta say, Bad Janet,
I really felt like

277
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,079
I had managed to stop the bleeding.

278
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,410
You thought that ding-dong
would do a total

279
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,370
personality 180 because
of one gentle metaphor?

280
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,419
What can I say? I'm an optimist.

281
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,580
But two days later at the event,

282
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,820
it fell apart almost immediately.

283
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,320
Hey, thanks for not telling
anyone about Jason.

284
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,820
Oh, well, ever since I arrived here,

285
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,580
Tahani helped me realize that gossip

286
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,483
was an unhealthy way for me
to boost my self-esteem.

287
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:15,520
But on the other hand,

288
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,220
this Jason tea needs to be spilled.

289
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,660
Just try to remember
what Emmanuel Kant said.

290
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,359
It is your duty to keep
your friend's secrets.

291
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,260
But my favorite philosopher,
Bethenny Frankel,

292
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,720
would say that I have a
duty to mention it all,

293
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,400
and if you can't handle the truth,

294
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,800
then you can't handle me!

295
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,140
And once again, I beg you,
please listen to Emmanuel Kant

296
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,079
and not Bethenny Frankel.

297
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,539
Ah, well, I gotta goss about something.

298
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,660
What about a few blind items

299
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,261
that I picked up around
the neighborhood?

300
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:43,120
You wanna know who wears the
same dumb shorts every day?

301
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,420
- No, I don't.
- It's Dumb Shorts Cathy.

302
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,700
Simone.

303
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,840
Uh, I have been thinking about

304
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,104
those very good questions
that you asked me.

305
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:54,200
And I'm sorry for the delay.
The ancient scrolls

306
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,979
I had to consult were
very hard to roll back up.

307
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,320
Um, anyway, I thought about
what you should say to Brent

308
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,300
when he asks for your
opinion of his novel.

309
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,830
Me, too. I have a great idea.

310
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,590
I'm gonna tell him it sucks very hard.

311
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,900
Well, listen, you're absolutely right

312
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,370
that Brent needs to evolve,

313
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,610
but there may be a more subtle
way to make that happen.

314
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,549
Hey, there they are!

315
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,759
- Charlie's Angels.
- Ooh.

316
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,650
So did you finish the book?
What did you think?

317
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,360
Well, very interesting word choices.

318
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,800
I've definitely never seen
the word "pants-tent"

319
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,059
used so many times.

320
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,760
Yeah, I kind of just felt
like, in that moment,

321
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,982
that that's what the
Surgeon General would say.

322
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,530
What else? Let's hear some more complos.

323
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,689
Compliments.

324
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,071
For when you introduce me.

325
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:43,319
Just writing a book is an
amazing accomplishment.

326
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,640
You bet your butt it is.
The story is incredible, too.

327
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,000
I mean, Chip solves the
mystery on page ten.

328
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,412
Greatest detective ever!

329
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:51,720
So hop on up there and
just speak from the heart

330
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,370
about how it's your favorite book ever.

331
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,209
Actually, I have to say, um...

332
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,740
the Scarlett Pakistan character
is clearly based on Tahani,

333
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,629
and it's not exactly flattering.

334
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,500
Not flattering?

335
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,540
I said she's got huge ones.

336
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,049
- Ultimate complo!
- Yeah, say there,

337
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,610
Brent, remember our conversation
about making mistakes

338
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,639
and how the most important
shot is the next one?

339
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,276
Hang on a second.
You guys agree with her?

340
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:19,899
Unreal!

341
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,319
I didn't ask to get yelled
at by the PC police.

342
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,339
You know, I was gonna give
you 10% off the cover price.

343
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,349
But now you're gonna have to pay

344
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,069
the full 65 bucks like everybody else.

345
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,080
There's no money here.

346
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,621
The book event is cancelled

347
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:32,190
because of these mean women.

348
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,190
Oh...

349
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,399
Perhaps I can convince Simone
to handle this the British way.

350
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,220
Smile bravely,

351
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,670
bury your feelings, and
allow a steady drizzle

352
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,019
to slowly wash away your
sadness over 50 years.

353
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,500
F that!

354
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,530
Simone is not the problem. Brent is.

355
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,800
He needs to change,
and walking on eggshells

356
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,340
around him ain't gonna do the trick.

357
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,239
We need to throw the
egg right at his face.

358
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,110
You're right. Enough is enough.

359
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,880
He lived on Earth for almost 60 years.

360
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,680
This experiment is more
than halfway over.

361
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,879
He's gotta improve,
and we can't wait forever.

362
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,919
Janet, where is he now?

363
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,459
Take a wild guess.

364
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,089
Hey, bud. What you up to?

365
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,639
- Gripping and ripping?
- Trying to.

366
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,509
Just seems like the big dog
don't wanna hunt today.

367
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,640
Simone was very mean to me.

368
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,689
- Maybe even a little racist.
- Well, listen.

369
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,300
Art is subjective.

370
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:31,060
But more importantly...

371
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,540
No other way to put this, buddy.

372
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,474
You made a mistake.
Your actions hurt people.

373
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,898
You have to take
responsibility for that.

374
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:41,780
You need to come back and apologize.

375
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,150
Take the first step toward
healing the neighborhood.

376
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,199
Fine, I'll be the bigger man.

377
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,360
Just like my dad,
when he single-handedly

378
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,989
took on all those class-action lawsuits.

379
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,709
I just wish I could get
through to the guy.

380
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,420
I wonder if he'd respond to
some Social Contract Theory.

381
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,930
Why are you trying to help him?

382
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,610
He doesn't even know you exist.

383
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,209
He doesn't see other people.

384
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,950
I mean, he did call
me a four-eyed coward

385
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,210
who probably dry humps books.

386
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,730
But why not be a bigger
person and rise above it?

387
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,410
I'll tell you why. Because doing that

388
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,809
sends a message that it's
okay to be treated this way.

389
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,180
And it's not okay to
treat anyone that way.

390
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,189
Not Tahani, not me, not even you, Igby.

391
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,970
Everyone, gather around, please.

392
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,529
Brent has something
that he'd like to say.

393
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,949
Okay.

394
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,820
Regarding my critically-acclaimed novel,

395
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,120
I am very sorry if you were offended.

396
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,150
Okay?

397
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,820
- Not an apology.
- Yes, it was.

398
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,590
Okay, fine.

399
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,549
I'm sorry if what I wrote,
which was perfectly okay,

400
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,940
somehow made you feel
like it wasn't okay.

401
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,570
But you know what? That's on you.

402
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,610
Brent. Wrong direction, bud.

403
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,690
No, sorry, man.
Either apologize for real

404
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,930
or stop wasting our time.

405
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,620
Okay, you know what?
I'm actually not sorry at all.

406
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,189
How about that? Is that
what you wanna hear?

407
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,180
Very obviously not.

408
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,050
You know what? Why don't we take
a break? Let's all get a snack.

409
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,230
Not until they give me the
complos I rightly deserve.

410
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,609
You want a complo?
I'll give you a complo.

411
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,470
I didn't think it was possible

412
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,489
to write a book as awful as yours.

413
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,159
I literally didn't think
human beings were capable

414
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,320
of such racist, sexist poppycock!

415
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,090
Also, Chip Driver is
either a private eye

416
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,650
or the quarterback for
the Chicago Bears,

417
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,910
or the "world's strongest president."

418
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,210
He cannot be all three!

419
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,130
Oh, boy.

420
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,090
This is a disgrace!
I accomplished something.

421
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,889
I wrote a novel,

422
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,729
and now my integrity's being attacked.

423
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,430
I've been called racist, sexist.

424
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,479
I don't have a racist or
sexist bone in my body.

425
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,560
I am Brent Norwalk,
and I'm a good person.

426
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,069
I'm in the Good Place.
You ever heard of it?

427
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,149
And I'm here because
I deserve to be here.

428
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,430
I'm here because I earned it

429
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,819
by being the best.

430
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,239
You're ridiculous.

431
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,659
Yeah, and you're a condescending bench.

432
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,780
Oh, uh, don't talk to
her that way, please.

433
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,070
Hey, I have an idea. Let me summon

434
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,790
a few philosophical
works we can use to...

435
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,129
Oh, enough with the
friggin' books, Igby.

436
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,289
Yeah, that's right. You
probably don't know this,

437
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,499
but that character is based on you.

438
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,339
No, I... I knew it, man.

439
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,549
- Oh, look out.
- Ah, I'm being attacked again!

440
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,350
- Sorry, that was unintentional...
- Fork you!

441
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,920
So I'm thinking bagel bites.

442
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,310
For the snack.

443
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,430
Middle-aged American male fragility.

444
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,190
You know why they're called
baby boomers, right?

445
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,750
Because the tiniest little pinprick

446
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,450
to their ego, and boom.

447
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,510
They become babies.

448
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,900
I mean, that was it. We were forked.

449
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,730
Six months of painstaking work,

450
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,320
trying to help the four humans

451
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,990
overcome their worst instincts
and bond as a group.

452
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,810
And in a poof, it was gone.

453
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,839
I told you, man. Humans suck.

454
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,080
Well, this story has one more chapter.

455
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,590
So today was bad.

456
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,390
Today was very bad. Everyone, for sure,

457
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,640
lost a bunch of points.

458
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,770
And I don't have a solution.

459
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,230
Okay, well, let's reset.

460
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,170
I'll do something mildly iffy,

461
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,980
and let John make a small,
good decision to help.

462
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,950
I could tell him I'm going
to get ombre highlights

463
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,159
and let him talk me out of it.

464
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
What's wrong with ombre highlights?

465
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,850
Eleanor, please.

466
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,280
This week has been hard enough.

467
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,750
I could set my robes on fire

468
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,830
and try and get Brent to put it out.

469
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,490
I know you're only suggesting that

470
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,890
because you've repeatedly
said you would look "dope"

471
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,070
in flaming monk robes,

472
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,809
but that's actually not a bad idea.

473
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,950
Force him to help someone

474
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,430
without actually thinking about it.

475
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,649
Maybe I'll ask Chidi to
lead a class on empathy.

476
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,820
Yes. Okay, let's write these down.

477
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,229
We got plenty of time left.

478
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,609
We can get back on track.

479
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,890
That was an hour ago.

480
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,610
Right before I came here to
see you for the last time.

481
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,790
For months, you and I
have been debating.

482
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,159
Are people good or bad?

483
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,999
But as I watched those three people

484
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,421
pick themselves up and
dust themselves off,

485
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:15,209
I realized we've been
asking the wrong question.

486
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,270
What matters isn't if
people are good or bad.

487
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,330
What matters is if they're
trying to be better today

488
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,450
than they were yesterday.

489
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,759
You asked me where my hope comes from.

490
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,389
That's your answer.

491
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,979
- What are you doing?
- Sending you home.

492
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,020
I'm not marbelizing you,
Janet. I'm letting you go.

493
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,070
I tried to win you over to our side,

494
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,569
and it hasn't worked.

495
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,659
So keeping you as a
prisoner just seems cruel.

496
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,850
Letting you go home is how I've decided

497
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,490
to be a little better today
than I was yesterday.

498
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,580
Here's your phone.

499
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,990
And a parting gift.

500
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,009
Oh, sweet, is that Brent's book?

501
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,130
No, I didn't have any cash on me,

502
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,700
so I couldn't get you a copy.

503
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,430
This is a manifesto detailing

504
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,340
everything that's
happened with the humans.

505
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,930
Janet and I wrote it a while back.

506
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,830
She's been updating it as we go.

507
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,519
- I hope you'll read it.
- Great thinking.

508
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,050
People that get books as
gifts always read them.

509
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,600
Bye!
