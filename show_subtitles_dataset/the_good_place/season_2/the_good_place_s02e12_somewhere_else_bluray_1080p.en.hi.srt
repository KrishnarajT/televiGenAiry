1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:05,780
So, Michael, you're saying there's
a new angle I should consider in this case?

2
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:08,199
Love that. Major drama.

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,535
Spill the tea, sweetheart.

4
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:14,747
The premise of our system is that a person's
score during her time on Earth

5
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,417
is final and inarguable.

6
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,587
But because of my accidental experiment

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,674
these four humans got better
after they died -

8
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:26,801
that's not supposed to be possible.

9
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:30,889
Over and over again, I watched as they became
thoughtful and generous and...

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,391
and caring, and... and think about
where they started.

11
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:34,684
Uh, Jason?

12
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:38,730
Growing up in Jacksonville, what did you do
for fun after school, every day?

13
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:41,941
Me and my friends whipped empty
spray paint cans at flamingos.

14
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:44,360
And now he's so much better.

15
00:00:44,486 --> 00:00:45,737
I was already pretty good.

16
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,114
When I was six, I hit one right on the butt.

17
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,158
OK, let the immortal beings talk, darling.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,076
So, they got better in your little
pretend world.

19
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,038
That doesn't prove anything
about what they were like on Earth.

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,582
No, see, I think it does prove something.

21
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:02,378
If I'm right, the system
by which we judge humans

22
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,591
the very method we use to deem them
good or bad

23
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:12,847
is so fundamentally flawed and unreasonable
that hundreds of millions of people

24
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:16,893
have been wrongly condemned
to an eternity of torture.

25
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:20,980
Damn! That was intense!

26
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:24,025
Look at my arm, y'all!
Look, I got goosebumps.

27
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,902
Huh, yeah.

28
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:27,403
Doesn't happen very often.

29
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:36,704
Wow. So, you saw your parents in the test?

30
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:37,997
Yes.

31
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:40,959
And I immediately fell right back
into my old pattern.

32
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,712
Desperately trying to impress them
and earn their admiration.

33
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:47,465
But then I heard this little voice
in my head saying

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,176
"Tahani. Don't do this."

35
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:53,263
The little voice in your head sounds like the
old lady from Downton Abbey?

36
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:54,597
Oh, yes, sorry.

37
00:01:54,764 --> 00:01:56,266
Maggie Smith is my Godmother.

38
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,185
Anyway, I took a deep breath.

39
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:02,438
Told them I ate a Cheeto and walked away.

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,731
Man!

41
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:06,234
You have made so much progress.

42
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,361
I'm proud of you, hot stuff.

43
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,906
Whatever progress I have made

44
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,701
it's because you and I have become mates.

45
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:17,787
That's British for "friends."
- No, I know.

46
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,044
Ooh, how are your shoulders so comfy?

47
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:28,590
Well, I was voted "best shoulders"
by British Vogue four years in a row.

48
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,758
I get it. You're perfect.

49
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:32,510
Eleanor... I'm kidding.

50
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:35,054
I was just taking the piss out of myself.

51
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,557
It was only two years.

52
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:40,226
Just doubled it... for humour.

53
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:42,353
OK.

54
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,232
Man, think about everything
that's happened to us.

55
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:49,694
We died, Michael tortured us,
we teamed up with him...

56
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:51,654
we escaped, we went through the portal

57
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:53,990
the Judge ruled against us,
then Michael showed up.

58
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,994
This has been one of the craziest years
of my life.

59
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,037
"One of"?

60
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:04,667
Yeah. I'm not sure what I would do
if one more insane thing happened.

61
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:05,752
Hi, Jason.

62
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:06,669
I love you.

63
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:08,588
Oh, word?

64
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,756
Word.

65
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:11,466
I've been avoiding telling you.

66
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:15,261
My excuse was that I needed time
to evaluate my complex feelings

67
00:03:15,303 --> 00:03:17,055
but that was just a rationalisation.

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,558
Hey, I guess I learned how to
rationalise too.

69
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,476
That's neat.

70
00:03:22,393 --> 00:03:26,147
This might be the last time I ever
get to talk to you, so there it is.

71
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:27,065
I love you.

72
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,609
And I hereby stop avoiding this topic

73
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,904
and rationalizing it by saying the situation
is complicated.

74
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:37,909
Or that my brain is grinding like a fork
in a garbage disposal.

75
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:38,993
Alright.

76
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:41,788
Whatever.
You're not really a part of this, Chidi.

77
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:43,539
Hey.

78
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:44,707
Guess what?

79
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,001
I think I love you too, girl.

80
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:48,127
I'm not a girl.

81
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,422
I'm also not just a "Janet" anymore.
I don't know what I am.

82
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,344
Hey, man. What's up?

83
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,814
Hot diggity dog!

84
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:09,899
Oh, no!

85
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:13,569
Now the thing I said right after we kissed
will always be, "Hot diggity dog!"

86
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:14,821
Whatever.

87
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,614
It was an honest reaction. I stand by it.

88
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:19,117
Hi, guys, couple quick announcements.

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,285
Would anyone eat chips and guac
if I put it out?

90
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,037
It's good. It's homemade.

91
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:24,080
No takers?

92
00:04:24,122 --> 00:04:27,500
Alright - second thing, we figured out a plan
to save your souls.

93
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,463
For the time being, the Judge
is gonna put you in your own Medium Places

94
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,589
like Mindy St Claire.

95
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:37,135
And while you're there,
I'll keep working every angle I can think of

96
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,470
to get you guys into the Good Place for real.

97
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:41,264
This is great. So, we'd all be together?

98
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:43,766
Oh, no, that's the thing about Medium Places.

99
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:46,769
It has to be tailored to what's medium
for the individuals

100
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,439
so if you're all together, it ain't medium.

101
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:51,649
How much time will we be alone?

102
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:54,610
Hard to say. Uh, could be a month.

103
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:56,404
Could be... a million years.

104
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:58,865
So, between a month and a million years.
Some...

105
00:04:58,906 --> 00:04:59,824
Yeah.
- Give or take.

106
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,701
Somewhere in there.
Come on, you guys.

107
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:06,330
I know this isn't perfect but I need more
time to build my case, and it's either this

108
00:05:06,497 --> 00:05:08,583
or back to the Bad Place.
- Yeah.

109
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,585
I'll say it.

110
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:12,628
Both those options suck.

111
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,173
OK, I'm sorry if that's blunt, Your Honour,
but it's true.

112
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:18,009
Also, Chidi just laid one on me,
so I'm kinda dizzy.

113
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:19,302
You two kissed?

114
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:21,304
Hot diggity dog!

115
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:22,430
That's what I said!

116
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,224
The point is, we've all gotten better.

117
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,935
Why should we have to go live alone
in a boring void

118
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:31,063
because of a messed-up system?
How is that justice?

119
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:34,692
OK, slow your roll there, Erin Brockovich.

120
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:40,031
First of all, y'all didn't get good enough
to pass the tests I just gave you.

121
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:43,659
Second, I still believe that the only reason
that you improved

122
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:45,286
in Michael's fake Neighbourhood

123
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:49,707
is because you thought there was a reward
at the end of the rainbow.

124
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,835
You're supposed to do good things
because you're good

125
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,838
not because you're seeking moral dessert.

126
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:59,342
And I still believe that they would've
become good people

127
00:05:59,383 --> 00:06:01,093
if they'd just gotten a...

128
00:06:04,555 --> 00:06:07,892
a push in the right direction.

129
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:10,812
Oh, no!

130
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,980
Nope. Nope. Absolutely not.

131
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:16,400
It's a little crazy.
- A little bit crazy? It's Looney Tunes.

132
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,069
What are they talking about?
- No idea.

133
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,239
It sets a very dangerous precedent.
- It's only four people.

134
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,241
And it's clearly the best way

135
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,577
to see if bad people can become good
without knowing anything about

136
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,162
what's waiting for them in the afterlife.

137
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,121
Shotgun!

138
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:31,666
Whatever they're talking about,
if there's a shotgun, I call shotgun.

139
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,000
It's never gonna work, man.

140
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:35,044
If it doesn't, then they go right back
to the Bad Place.

141
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,337
No one gets hurt

142
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,922
except them. Forever.

143
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:41,050
And me, I assume, also... forever.

144
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,011
Mmmm...

145
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,012
ughhhhh...

146
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,973
eeeuuuoww...

147
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:48,140
OK, let's do it.

148
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:49,058
Yes!

149
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:51,686
I don't know why,
I'm just feeling kinda funky.

150
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:55,481
But there have to be strict rules,
otherwise the results will be tainted

151
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:59,861
and I reserve the right to change my mind
at any point.

152
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,113
About what? Would someone who's not
an eternal being

153
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:04,240
please explain to me what the f...

154
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,160
Why are you like this?

155
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:10,705
Excuse me? "Why am I like this?"

156
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:12,331
You don't know me, dude.

157
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,708
You don't know what I'm like.

158
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:16,002
Look what you made me do, jagoff.

159
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:17,253
Ugh...

160
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,130
- Look out!
- Uh-oh.

161
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:34,604
Holy crap.

162
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:36,898
I just almost died.

163
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:40,401
She needs to know what was said.

164
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:43,821
That was so unfair.
- First of all, this was just yesterday.

165
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,198
God, Eleanor. Take longer next time.

166
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,742
Oh, you look like crap.

167
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:53,122
I was outside the supermarket arguing
with that little environmental twerp.

168
00:07:53,164 --> 00:07:54,790
Ugh, I hate that guy.

169
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:57,710
Really? That skinny little hippie body
kinda turns me on.

170
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:58,669
Gross.

171
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:03,299
Guys, listen! I dropped the margarita mix
and when I went to pick it up

172
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,261
a bunch of shopping carts came right at me,
and I was just frozen.

173
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:09,931
And then someone pushed me out of the way

174
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:14,060
and the carts got, like, demolished
by a truck.

175
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:16,520
I mean, I could've died.

176
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:17,980
Oh, my God.
- Whoa.

177
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:19,523
That's crazy.

178
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:22,985
So, is the margarita mix, like, gone?

179
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:26,697
I had a near-death experience recently.
You know that old warehouse that burned down

180
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,449
last month and like, four people died?

181
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,911
That building is, like, right by
my old dentist.

182
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:35,247
If I still went to that dentist,
and I had an appointment that day

183
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:38,584
I would've been, like... right near there.

184
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:41,545
I was in Syracuse, New York

185
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,966
like, two weeks before 9/11.

186
00:08:45,174 --> 00:08:46,467
No way!
- Yeah.

187
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,551
Fourteen days.

188
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,804
I can't believe we all almost died.
- I know!

189
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:52,056
I'm like...

190
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:58,604
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

191
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:00,856
And I think I might be a monster.

192
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,275
I'm rude. I'm selfish.

193
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,195
I cyber-bullied Ryan Lochte
until he quit Instagram.

194
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,447
But something happened to me today

195
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:14,245
and from now on I'm gonna try to become
a better, kinder, more generous person.

196
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:18,582
Hey! Can I use your credit card?

197
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,168
You know what? Yes, you can.

198
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,294
Cool. It's for porn.

199
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:23,212
I already used it.

200
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:34,890
Hey.

201
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:36,142
You look happy.

202
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:37,268
Did you get laid last night?

203
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:38,310
I didn't.

204
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:39,729
Tried. Hard.

205
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,481
With this chick that I met
after I followed her into a yoga class

206
00:09:42,523 --> 00:09:43,941
but she wasn't into it.

207
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,776
Maced me - right in the eyes.

208
00:09:46,193 --> 00:09:47,278
Stung like hell.

209
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,779
What was I saying?

210
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,406
Oh, yeah. Hey.

211
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:51,574
Listen, dude.

212
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,783
What you're doing here

213
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,327
selling fake medicine to people,
tricking them...

214
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,996
is wrong.

215
00:09:58,122 --> 00:09:59,373
Yeah. And?

216
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,418
I can't be a part of it anymore.
I'm trying to become a better person...

217
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,753
and as long as I work here...

218
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:05,463
Yeah, sure, fine, whatever, you quit.

219
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,214
Who cares? Give me your company ID.

220
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:09,508
Thank you.

221
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,718
And your parking pass.

222
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:12,928
And your panties, please.

223
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,263
Dude!
- What? Come on.

224
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:15,181
I had to try.

225
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:17,683
By the way, technically
that is not sexual harassment

226
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:20,561
because she doesn't work here anymore.
- You're wearing a wire?

227
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,646
Yeah. Company's being investigated for fraud

228
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,565
so I'm helping the feds bring everyone down.

229
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:25,900
Good timing on your part.

230
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,401
Thank you?
- No.

231
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:28,527
Thank you...

232
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,404
for wearing open-toed shoes today.

233
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,364
Wow.
- Dude. Get help.

234
00:10:32,573 --> 00:10:34,992
I'm becoming a better person.
You should too.

235
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:36,702
Hey, Eleanor!

236
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:38,746
Do you want to come to Lauren's baby shower?

237
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,122
Do you wanna chew on my ass...

238
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:41,540
sss...

239
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,000
sortment of brownies

240
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,544
that I will be bringing to Lauren's
baby shower?

241
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,796
Sure.

242
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:49,757
Hi, there. Do you have a second
to talk about the environment?

243
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:51,675
Hey. Remember me?

244
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,676
Ah! Don't hurt me!

245
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,303
My bones are brittle.
I have a calcium deficiency.

246
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:55,888
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, man.

247
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:57,681
I came to apologise.

248
00:10:59,058 --> 00:10:59,934
There, I did it.

249
00:10:59,975 --> 00:11:00,893
I apologised.

250
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:03,312
No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, assface!

251
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,689
Mm... nope. You're right. I didn't.

252
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,986
I apologise for being mean to you,
like a thousand times.

253
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:13,489
There's really no excuse.

254
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,241
Thanks.

255
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:17,034
Apology accepted.

256
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,077
OK.

257
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,663
Uh, what's happening? I'm scared.

258
00:11:20,704 --> 00:11:23,499
Hey, I'm on kind of, like,
a self-improvement kick.

259
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,628
Do you think you could help me out?
Teach me to get all horny for the environment

260
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,546
or whatever?

261
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,465
Hey, everyone. This is Eleanor.

262
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,967
She's joining the team.

263
00:11:33,008 --> 00:11:34,718
Hi.

264
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,846
Welcome.
- Nice to meet you. Hi.

265
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,394

Mm. Babes, get in on these nachos,
they're delish.

275
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:29,023
Mm-hm.
- I'm actually trying to eat vegetarian.

276
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:30,482
Ew! Why?

277
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:32,902
Is it because you feel bad
for all the widdle animals

278
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:34,195
with their cute widdle faces

279
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,989
because people stuff them into tiny cages
just so that we can eat them?

280
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,450
Yeah. That's exactly why, actually.

281
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:42,119
Also, it's the easiest way to lower
your carbon foot print

282
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,913
not eating meat.
- What?

283
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,040
OK, guys, um...

284
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,541
Can I say something for a second?

285
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,710
I love you.
- Aw!

286
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:52,463
I do. I mean, I went through a really
rough time last year

287
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:55,299
with the whole "Dress Bitch" thing and people
selling t-shirts with my face on them

288
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,426
but you two stuck by me.

289
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,095
I love you, you dumb sluts!
- Aaaah!

290
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:01,639
Come on!

291
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,724
OK, there's probably something
we should tell you.

292
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:07,144
Or not. We could also not.

293
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,563
We have to. It's the right thing to do.

294
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:14,360
I tore your dress. And then I lied about it.

295
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,072
And then Brittany and I were the ones
who made and sold the t-shirts.

296
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,074
But... we did not keep the money.

297
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,034
Yes, we did. We kept all the money.

298
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,119
And I'm really sorry.

299
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:26,205
OK.

300
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:30,793
That took a lot of courage for you
to admit that.

301
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:34,171
Mm-hm.
- And I admire your honesty.

302
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,757
You stupid skank!

303
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,801
How could you do that to me?

304
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:41,095
I hate you! You're both disgusting hogs

305
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,889
and I want you to move out
of my apartment, forever!

306
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:45,766
Literally starting right now!

307
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:50,271
I'm still really glad we told the truth.

308
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,356
Cooooool.

309
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,565
Mm.

310
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:57,987
OK, steamed vegetable medley and ice water.

311
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,446
Can I just get the check?

312
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:02,658

321
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:45,743
They're suing you?

322
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,619
This chick is claiming she has whiplash.

323
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:50,122
She wasn't in the car when I hit it.

324
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:51,206
This is on you.

325
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:53,834
You should've pretended like
you didn't see it and walked away.

326
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:55,669
Like everyone else does.

327
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:59,089
I know! I've hit your car like six times
and never said anything.

328
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,050
But I'm trying to be good.

329
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:05,387
How's that working out for you?

330
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:16,815
It's open, dummy!

331
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:20,361
Eleanor! Where have you been?

332
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:21,820
Oh, hey, man.

333
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:25,074
Sorry, it's been a crazy month, you know?

334
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:27,368
Moving was a hassle,
and I'm in the middle of a lawsuit

335
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:29,912
and I ate vegetables for the first time

336
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:31,663
and I got diarrhoea for, like, a week.

337
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,291
Uh... I know we don't pay a lot
but this is a job

338
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,876
and we need to know we can count on you.

339
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:38,504
We're meeting tonight to discuss long-term
strategy for the organisation.

340
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:40,130
Dude, dude, dude, dude...
- I really think it would be—

341
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,759
dude, dude, dude. Oh, sorry to interrupt
whatever boring crap this is

342
00:15:43,801 --> 00:15:45,636
but, dude, you need to get dressed.

343
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:48,222
I got tickets to Taylor Splift

344
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:50,265
the Taylor Swift reggae cover band.

345
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:52,726
They're terrible. It's gonna be amazing!

346
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:56,230
Yeah, that sounds like more fun.

347
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,606
I'm-a do that.
- Eleanor!

348
00:15:57,648 --> 00:15:59,817
What! What, dude?

349
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,985
I've been nothing but good for, like,
six months

350
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,780
and all I have to show for it
is this crummy apartment

351
00:16:04,822 --> 00:16:07,616
a lawsuit, a loose caboose,
and an overdrawn bank account.

352
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:10,536
Being good is for suckers.
What do you even get out of it?

353
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:14,164
A feeling of fulfillment... in your soul.

354
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,503
Gross. That's the grossest sentence
I've ever heard.

355
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,004
OK? I quit.

356
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,881
Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch.

357
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:25,592
Whew!

358
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,219
I still think he's kinda hot.

359
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:30,180
I guess, in like a sick Victorian boy
kinda way.

360
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,391
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I want to, like, feed him soup.

361
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:34,852
It is good to have you back.

362
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,520
You are one of the most gifted con-women

363
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,605
I have ever watched sleep through her window.

364
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:42,609
Thanks, bud. So, tell me about
the new business.

365
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,570
We sell classes at a for-profit university

366
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:47,156
and the classes train people how to sell
supplements.

367
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,783
So, it's a ponzi scheme
within a ponzi scheme.

368
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,034
That sounds kinda dicey.

369
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,161
Oh, it's super dicey.

370
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:56,039
But I'm in witness protection so technically
I can't be convicted of any crime.

371
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,542
Well, that's definitely not true,
but I also don't care.

372
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,751
Which one's my desk?

373
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,382
You realise what the problem is, right?
- Yes.

374
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,592
But there's no way to help.

375
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,890
I'm only giving that guy three stars

376
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,766
cos he didn't let me stick my head out
the moonroof.

377
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:15,684
Yeah!

378
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:18,228
Dude, my boyfriend just texted.

379
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,397
His wife's out of town,
so I'm gonna head over there.

380
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,398
Mwah!

381
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,026
What? That's lame. Boo!

382
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,527
Happy birthday!

383
00:17:25,694 --> 00:17:27,070
Hello, bartender.

384
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:29,072
One alcohol drink, please.

385
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:31,200
It's my birthday, if you wanna
give it to me for free.

386
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:34,870
I always say that,
but it actually is my birthday.

387
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:38,332
Last year on my birthday, I almost died

388
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:44,171
and then I did a bunch of stuff
that was good, but weird

389
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,716
and then I stopped, and now I'm here.

390
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,011
Sounds like you had a pretty crazy year.

391
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,180
Hm.
- Wanna talk about it?

392
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:58,894
And in the end, Anthony Anderson
and Jerry O'Connell

393
00:17:58,936 --> 00:18:00,729
started a successful shampoo company

394
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:04,274
and you see the kangaroo
jumping around Australia.

395
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,947
That is the plot to the movie
"Kangaroo Jack."

396
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:11,490
Why'd I tell you that?

397
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:12,491
It's unclear.

398
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,993
You know, the thing is...

399
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:17,663
the problem, really, with being a do-gooder?

400
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,332
What's that?
- No one cares.

401
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,668
I mean some people care a little bit.

402
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:26,129
The twerpy little twerps
from the environmental place, they care

403
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,049
but I was a good person for six months.

404
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,510
That's, like, five years.

405
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:35,681
And it felt OK but not as good
as I thought it would.

406
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:37,724
And what did I get for it?

407
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,687
Ah, see? Now you're talking about
moral dessert.

408
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:42,604
Exactly.

409
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:45,357
Wait. I am? What?

410
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:51,071
"Moral dessert" is the concept that if you
act with virtue, you deserve a reward.

411
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:53,615
Right. I did a bunch of good stuff.

412
00:18:53,657 --> 00:18:57,160
I didn't get jack. Not fair, universe!

413
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,122
Alright, even if the universe
did function that way

414
00:19:00,163 --> 00:19:03,667
who's to say that you didn't dig yourself
such a deep hole

415
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,544
over the first 34 years of your life

416
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:10,882
that the six months you spent being good
weren't enough to get you out of that hole?

417
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:14,136
See, there's a lot of great writing
about this, if you're interested.

418
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:18,015
Who died and made you in charge
of frickin' every...

419
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:19,558
knowing everything.

420
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:26,773
Well, you know, I recently got sort of into
ethics and moral philosophy.

421
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,319
You sound like a real live wire.

422
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:31,486
Whatevs.

423
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:34,906
The point is,
if I'm not gonna get rewarded somehow

424
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:38,660
with, like, a tiara
or one of those diagonal award belts.

425
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,162
Sash.
- Sure.

426
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:42,497
Sash.
- Then why should I do good things?

427
00:19:43,373 --> 00:19:47,419
You know, I had a friend that said whenever
she was doing something bad

428
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:50,464
she'd hear this... this little voice
in her head.

429
00:19:50,505 --> 00:19:54,176
Distant little voice saying,
"Oh, come on now, you know this is wrong."

430
00:19:54,801 --> 00:19:58,972
And then when she started doing good things,
that voice went away.

431
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:00,807
It was a relief.

432
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:06,355
Your friend sounds like
she's one pickle short of a pickle party.

433
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,816
I might have alcohol poisoning.

434
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,944
She was a little rough
around the edges, but...

435
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,988
she was also a really good person.

436
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:16,615
When she tried.

437
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:20,035
See, I think that little voice
was her conscience

438
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,663
trying to guide her in the right direction.

439
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:26,458
I gotta go home. What do I owe ya?

440
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,959
The real question, Eleanor

441
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,046
is what do we owe to each other?

442
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:33,090
What?

443
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,051
Did I sell you a drink? Am I a bartender?

444
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:37,886
Drinks are on me.

445
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,055
Good luck.

446
00:20:45,936 --> 00:20:47,145
Ow...

447
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:53,860
Anybody notice I was gone?

448
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:54,778
Nope.

449
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,299
What do we owe to each other?

450
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,344
That is the question Tim Scanlon asked
decades ago

451
00:21:19,928 --> 00:21:24,057
and it is the question I will try to answer
over the next three hours.

452
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:25,726
Ugh. No, thanks.

453
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,853
We all have a voice in our head.

454
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:31,064
That voice doesn't tell us what to do,
or not do

455
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:36,445
but it does warn us when we do things
that don't feel good or right.

456
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:38,572
The difference between...
- The term "reasonable."

457
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,700
What does it mean to be a reasonable person?

458
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:44,286
I may have a different definition
of reasonable...

459
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:45,328
So, why do it then?

460
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,122
Why choose to be good every day

461
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:52,377
if there is no guaranteed reward
we can count on, now or in the afterlife?

462
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:56,506
I argue that we choose to be good
because of our bonds with other people

463
00:21:56,548 --> 00:22:00,302
and our innate desire
to treat them with dignity.

464
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,638
At the intersection of empathy and ethics

465
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:08,226
is the realisation
that we are not in this alone.

466
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:09,644
Thank you.

467
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,356
Hey, dog bait.

468
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,025
Didn't you get my message? Let's go!

469
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:16,318
Time is booze.

470
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:18,111
Yeah, no thanks. I'm...

471
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:20,781
going somewhere else.

472
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:28,872
Hi.
- G'day.

473
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,999
Where you headed?
- Saint John's University, please.

474
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:31,917
No worries.

475
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,173
Do you wanna talk to God?

476
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:40,342
What? No. Get away from me, freak.

477
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,488
Hi.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

478
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,572
Office hours are on Tuesday.

479
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,032
Oh, I... I'm not a student.

480
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:06,576
Are you Chidi Ana... Kendrick?

481
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:08,954
Anagonye. And yes.

482
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:12,082
From the long, nerdy video about
the little voice that tells you to be good?

483
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:14,000
From the Kissac Foundation lecture series

484
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,628
on the practical applications
of ethical theory - yes.

485
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,712
Great. Hi.

486
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:19,256
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

487
00:23:20,715 --> 00:23:21,633
Can we talk?

488
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:25,554
OK.

489
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:27,639
Here we go.
