1
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,631
You alright there, chief?

2
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:16,799
You look like you lost your lucky bookmark
or something.

3
00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:17,842
Oh, no! Did I?

4
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:21,971
It's fine. I got it right here.

5
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:25,391
It's just that now
that we're actually on the train

6
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,435
heading to Bad Place headquarters

7
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,521
this plan is starting to feel slightly...

8
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,689
completely insane.

9
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:34,067
This is the only way to get to the Judge?

10
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,485
I'm afraid so. Yes.

11
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:38,363
See, the Judge exists in a sort of
neutral zone

12
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:40,573
separate from the Good Place
and the Bad Place.

13
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:43,117
The only things there
are the Judge's quarters

14
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,410
the Accounting department

15
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:45,954
and the Janet Warehouse.

16
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:48,915
No, there's also an IHOP.

17
00:00:48,957 --> 00:00:51,793
Dope! I'm gonna order
the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity!

18
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:52,961
No, sorry, um...

19
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:57,298
in this realm, IHOP stands for
"Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes."

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,801
You don't really eat these pancakes

21
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:01,678
it's more like they eat you.

22
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:03,555
OK, I'll get eggs then.

23
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:07,267
So, the only way to get to the Judge
is through a Portal

24
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:10,395
which is smack dab
in the middle of the main office

25
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:11,854
at Bad Place headquarters.

26
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:14,440
And the only way through the Portal
is with one of these.

27
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:17,360
What is that? Is that jewellery?
Not that it matters.

28
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,654
It's just some jewellery I don't have.

29
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:22,448
Can I have it?
- These pins are very hard to come by

30
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:24,951
only upper management-types have them.

31
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:27,704
So, you guys will lay low,
while I get us four more.

32
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,164
Janet doesn't need one, because for Portals

33
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:31,833
she counts as a "carry-on."

34
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,251
I'm luggage.

35
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:36,796
I had Janet make you each
a Bad Place disguise

36
00:01:36,838 --> 00:01:38,881
and everyone who worked in the Neighbourhood

37
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:41,050
has been sent back
to their previous departments

38
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:43,928
so the chances of you being recognised
are very small.

39
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:47,307
I don't know. This plan seems complicated.

40
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:50,226
To be fair, you also once said that
about an orange.

41
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:51,561
They don't make sense!

42
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,773
Apples you eat their clothes,
but oranges you don't?

43
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:56,774
Forget this plan.

44
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,985
I say we just huck a Molotov cocktail and...

45
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,653
Whew! Run through the Portal.

46
00:02:00,695 --> 00:02:05,158
As much as I respect your explosive-based
problem-solving skills

47
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,577
I think we should go with Michael's plan.

48
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,996
I'm telling you, Molotov cocktails work.

49
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:13,583
Any time I had a problem,
and I threw a Molotov cocktail - boom!

50
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,127
right away, I had a different problem.

51
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,920
He makes a strong case.

52
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:28,473
OK, now, you're all gonna need aliases.

53
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:31,517
Cool. I'm gonna be... "Diana Tremaine."

54
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:33,394
That was the name on my fake ID
in high school.

55
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:36,439
Her address was 123 Whatever Street

56
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:37,899
Canada City, Canada.

57
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,026
Arizona bouncers are the best.

58
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,445
Character work! Such fun.

59
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:45,740
I actually dabbled in a bit of acting
after university.

60
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:49,202
Although, mostly, I just stood around
while Baz Luhrmann just threw glitter on me.

61
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:52,413
- Ooh, I shall be...
- "Rhonda Mumps"

62
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,583
and I work down at the hot dog factory!
- You need to be more specific.

63
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,752
There are nine hot dog torture departments.

64
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:01,214
Making people into, stuffing people with...

65
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,091
Ooh, stuffing people sounds fun.

66
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,718
Is that like shoving them into the throats
of vegans?

67
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:06,803
Yes.

68
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:07,970
throats.

69
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,014
I know what my secret identity is.

70
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,808
You cannot be "Blake Bortles."

71
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,976
Fine. Then I'll be "Jake."

72
00:03:14,018 --> 00:03:15,728
Don't say "Jortles."
- "Jortles"!

73
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,189
And I work in the Molotov cocktail
department.

74
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,067
Boy, you know, I thought you guys would be
more worried about this.

75
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,736
We've been knee-deep in demons
for, like, 800 reboots now.

76
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:26,572
- Lying about who we are is second-nature.
- Huh.

77
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:29,242
Chidi?

78
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:32,286
I hate this, I hate lying,
it's not permissible, I can't do this!

79
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:33,204
Oh, boy.

80
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,666
Jeez Louise!

81
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,544
Looks like Chidi has a real case
of the Mondays, am I right?

82
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:42,463
Hey, uh... pass the Nascar-ketchup!

83
00:03:45,216 --> 00:03:46,217
Hey, buddy.

84
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,763
Look, if you don't want to lie because
it conflicts with your moral principles

85
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:51,681
I get it.

86
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:54,142
No one's going to be mad at you.

87
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:55,393
Really?

88
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,602
No, dumbass!

89
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:58,688
I'm lying to you to make you feel better!

90
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,398
See? Sometimes lying is awesome!

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,275
Plus, I said "dumbass!"

92
00:04:02,316 --> 00:04:04,235
Oh, cursing - how I've missed you.

93
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:08,072
Look, Eleanor, our goal here is to appear
in front of a Judge

94
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,116
who is going to judge us.

95
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,660
What if I lie down here,
and I lose 12 points

96
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:15,329
and then we get in front of the Judge
and I'm 12 points short?

97
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:19,208
Or what if the Judge won't even take our case
at all, because we lied to get there?

98
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,087
Kant says that lying is always wrong
and I follow that maxim.

99
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,132
So, you can't even lie to demons?
They're trying to torture us, man!

100
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:27,300
We're behind enemy lines!

101
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,677
Look, principles aren't principles
when you pick and choose

102
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:31,220
when you're going to follow them.

103
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:34,056
I won't lie about who I am.

104
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:36,309
OK.

105
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,938
I understand, and I'm cool with it.

106
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,275
You're lying right now, aren't you?
- Yes, I wanna strangle you.

107
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:49,238
What even is this thing?

108
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:51,532
I hate suits.

109
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:54,535
They remind me of court,
and going to court

110
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:58,164
and being my own lawyer
against the advice of the judge in court

111
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,708
and getting immediately convicted in court.

112
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,376
I think you look nice.

113
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:04,212
I think you look sexy.

114
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:06,547
Here.

115
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,634
I got you this to help your disguise.
- Whoa, a briefcase?

116
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,638
"Take my credit card to the hedge fund.
I'll meet you at the martini store."

117
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,807
Oh, you're gonna get caught.
Give me the briefcase back. Thanks.

118
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:17,183
Aw...

119
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,727
Janet, you need to get in character, too.

120
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:23,189
Now, I know you look like a Bad Janet
but can you act like one?

121
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:24,774
I have gained a lot of new skills recently.

122
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:27,109
For example, I learned how to be
passive aggressive.

123
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,111
Totally fine that you guys haven't noticed.

124
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,447
Oh!
- Well, let's practice.

125
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:32,365
OK.

126
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:33,825
I'm going to make a simple request

127
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,619
and you're going to give me that patented
"Bad Janet" attitude.

128
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,913
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Here you go.

129
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,039
No.

130
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:41,624
Let's try again. Be mean!

131
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,086
Bad Janet, can I have a glass of water?

132
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:46,546
No.

133
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:49,257
I would never give you that, you...

134
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:51,634
dumb person.

135
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,553
Janet, what's that behind your back?
- Nothing.

136
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:55,179
Give it to me.
- It's a glass of water.

137
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,264
Oh...

138
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,432
And a back-up glass. Oh, boy...
- Oh!

139
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:01,435
It's OK, we'll keep working.

140
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,062
OK.
- You'll get the hang of it

141
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:07,400
Or my name isn't Rhonda Apple Pie
Spiderman Mumps.

142
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:09,527
We're here.

143
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,574
All trains today are delayed
by three hours.

144
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,034
Just like they are every day.

145
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:21,998
All passengers, you all suck and you're ugly.

146
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,624
Keep walking.

147
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,877
Again. You all suck...
- Keep your heads down.

148
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:27,670
and you are ugly.

149
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:29,505
Just act unnatural.

150
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:33,301
Hey, guys.

151
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:36,012
So, you wait here, while I go get us
some more of these pins.

152
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,139
But what is this place?
- It's just a place.

153
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,684
You know, an area, or "location."
It's pretty straightforward.

154
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,394
"The Museum of Human Misery?"

155
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,979
Oh. Yeah, OK.

156
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,355
It's a torture museum.

157
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:50,610
Famous examples of bad behaviour,
and explanations of the torture they earned.

158
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,904
Is there a gift shop?
- Jason, this is Hell.

159
00:06:53,237 --> 00:06:54,822
Of course there's a gift shop.

160
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:59,827
It's the least horrifying room.
It's the "Hall of Low-Grade Crappiness."

161
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:04,582
"First person to floss
in an open-plan office."

162
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:11,255
Well, she deserves to be tortured -
she's a monster.

163
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,341
This was the safest place I could think of

164
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:14,717
no one ever comes in here.

165
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,094
Guys, if you do leave this room

166
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:20,139
you're gonna see things
that will haunt you for eternity.

167
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,642
OK, back soon. Bye.

168
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:23,851
Hey, hey.

169
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:25,645
Be careful. OK?

170
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,564
"Be careful"?

171
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:29,690
Yeah.

172
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,985
Oh, Eleanor, are you worried about me?

173
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,488
Yeah, I'm worried.

174
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,157
I mean, cos you're our ticket
out of here, genius.

175
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,201
Don't go getting all goopy on me.

176
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:41,494
No, worry about them. I'll be fine.

177
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:42,954
OK.

178
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:51,504
"First man to send an unsolicited picture
of his genitals."

179
00:07:56,592 --> 00:07:58,177
Heh... heh... heh...

180
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:01,555
"First waiter to approach a diner
with an empty plate"

181
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:06,185
"and, sarcastically, say,
'I guess you hated it.'"

182
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:08,479
"First white person to grow dreadlocks."

183
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:12,191
And first person to call ultimate Frisbee
"ultimate"!

184
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,567
This dude rules!

185
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,528
Alright, everyone...

186
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:16,737
we've got a lot of work to do.

187
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,490
Why don't you set up the bar over by that wall?

188
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:23,953
Why don't you roll off your mum
and do it yourself, ya fat dink?

189
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:30,292
Set up more of those tables.
We're expecting a big crowd.

190
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,711
You got it, you piece of...

191
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,088
butt.

192
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,631
Son of a bitch!

193
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:39,885
Still happy I can swear now,
but everything else about this is very bad.

194
00:08:44,515 --> 00:08:45,391
Hey, boss.

195
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:46,392
I'm back.

196
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,185
Welcome home. Axe up.

197
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:51,063
Ho! New scent.

198
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,982
"Transformers."
- Yes.

199
00:08:53,024 --> 00:08:55,860
It makes you smell the way "Transformers"
movies make you feel.

200
00:08:55,901 --> 00:08:58,362
Still can't believe those jack-offs
got away from us.

201
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,905
Really zips my tip.

202
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:01,115
Yeah.
- Anyway...

203
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:04,618
I drew up some extradition papers
to get them back from Mindy's.

204
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,288
I think I'll take a few
of my most trusted staff

205
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:10,207
hop in the Portal, file those with the Judge

206
00:09:10,624 --> 00:09:12,043
quick stop for pancakes

207
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:13,836
and then I'll head on back.

208
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:15,546
By the way, I'm gonna need, uh...

209
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,506
four pins, for my crew.

210
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,842
This is very thorough, however...

211
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:25,181
Is that where we're putting
top-priority files nowadays?

212
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:26,891
We won't need extradition papers.

213
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:31,228
Plans are already in motion
to get the humans back in a different way.

214
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:32,605
Ah.

215
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:38,944
Oh man, this is not good.

216
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,448
This is noooot good!

217
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:45,576
Would you chill out?
Haven't you ever crashed a party before?

218
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,120
No! I've only been to like,
four parties total

219
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,748
and all of them were thrown by Tahani
after I was already dead.

220
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,293
Alright, well, we can't just stand here
in a group, looks too conspicuous.

221
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:56,587
I'll go with Tahani, Chidi go with Jason.

222
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:59,924
That way, Jason's unearned confidence
let's him do all the talking

223
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:01,675
and you don't have to lie. OK?

224
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:03,719
Come on, Diana!
Let's hit the bar!

225
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:06,472
I'm gonna get me a tall glass
of pipin' hot corn syrup

226
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:09,058
and a scooter so I can roll around the mall!

227
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:10,851
That's really good.
- Thank you.

228
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:12,603
Hors d'oeuvre?

229
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:13,979
Ooh, what do you got?

230
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:16,524
Soul food from Maine, bagels from Arkansas

231
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:17,900
Hawaiian pizza, of course

232
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:21,278
and egg salad from a hospital vending machine
in Azerbaijan.

233
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,488
Uh, that!

234
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:23,906
Have a terrible evening.

235
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:27,326
No way! Trent? Is that you?

236
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,620
Uh, who else could it be?

237
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,581
Come on. Tap it out. Boom-boom!

238
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:34,416
Whassup? I'm Chet.

239
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,336
Jake is my name,
Molotov cocktails is my game.

240
00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:41,340
I think school is lame, I gotta tattoo
of David Blaine! What!

241
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:42,633
Whoo! Tight!

242
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,176
Ball tap!

243
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,928
Dip! Ball tap!

244
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,639
Oh! That's a firm ball tap, bro.

245
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:52,852
Anyway, cha'boy Trent and I worked together
in Partial Decapitations.

246
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,104
When did you leave de-cap?
800 years ago?

247
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:56,522
Uh, something like that.

248
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:59,150
I just joined a new department -
Toxic Masculinity.

249
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,443
We torture internet trolls, frat dudes.

250
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,487
It actually started as a training program

251
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,322
to prep for when
the "Girls Gone Wild" dude gets here.

252
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:06,657
Joe Francis!
- The one.

253
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,867
Legend!

254
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:09,285
Ha-ha! Bro-hams!

255
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,162
Get over here and meet my top dog, Trent.

256
00:11:11,412 --> 00:11:13,539
Dude's a straight beast
when it comes to torture!

257
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:14,456
Sup, bro?
- Sup, bro?

258
00:11:14,498 --> 00:11:17,126
It's actually pretty choice that we're
running into you right now.

259
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:20,045
My top dog Dirk here,
he got stuck with a new case.

260
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:22,673
He can't crack it. Hit 'em with it, D-Money.

261
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,134
So, I'm trying to torture
this guy, right, Brant.

262
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:29,263
Brant was a total lord - he got kicked off
of Rob Gronkowski's party cruise

263
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:32,808
for throwing a lobster at a stripper,
and then he died doing a keg stand

264
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,351
in the back of a moving Jeep Wrangler.

265
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,104
Anyways, we run a couple hundred
torture scenarios

266
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:40,524
none of them seemed quite right, you know?
Think we can get you to crack this nut?

267
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,401
Well, I mean, how... how can I say no?

268
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:44,862
Yeah, I know how I would say no.

269
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:45,779
You know, I'd be all like...

270
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:46,697
"No!"

271
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,073
But... You know, I can't.

272
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,409
You're so weird, Trent, man.
You're always so weird.

273
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:52,286
I love that about you.
- Yeah...

274
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:55,164
Don't get me wrong,
I love shoving hot dogs into people

275
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:59,210
But once you've dogged every hole, you just
start to feel like you're repeating yourself.

276
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,127
Whew. I hear that, sister.

277
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:02,004
I'm gonna go take a dump -
you want me to grab you one?

278
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,172
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

279
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:04,965
Not even a little nug?
- Nah, I'm 'aight.

280
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:05,841
Alright.

281
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:07,384
Damn, you're good at this.

282
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,471
Well, hang out with Johnny Depp long enough
and you become pretty good at lying.

283
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:14,391
Like, "No, your whole thing isn't
exhausting at all!"

284
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,562
Hi there, you big stinky poop-face guys!

285
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,813
Ugh, it's me - Good Janet!

286
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,565
I'm sorry I called you big stinky
poop-face guys.

287
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,235
That's OK. Janet,
can you dig around a little bit

288
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:28,030
and find out what this event is,
and how long it's gonna last?

289
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:31,825
I'd love to! Punch your... teeth!

290
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:32,910
Hey.

291
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:34,119
Teeth...

292
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,790
What's all this?

293
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:41,669
Well, I was going to try to get the humans
back by going through the proper channels

294
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,795
but then I remembered -

295
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:45,005
I'm a naughty bitch.

296
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,382
So...

297
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:49,510
I sent a black ops team to Mindy's,
to... "extract" them.

298
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:52,638
Nobody from the Bad Place
is allowed in Mindy's Neighbourhood.

299
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,182
You can't do that, Shawn.
It's... it's... it's illegal!

300
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:56,100
Oh, no.

301
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,770
Guys, Michael says this is illegal.
I hadn't thought of that.

302
00:13:01,272 --> 00:13:03,482
That was sarcasm - I had thought of that.

303
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,859
Listen, your experiment blew up in our faces.

304
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:08,195
The example I made out of Vicky ensured
that everybody from the Neighbourhood

305
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:09,822
has kept their mouths shut,
but we're not out of the woods

306
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:11,532
until those four are back in custody.

307
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:15,369
So, I rounded up some loyal friends,
and took matters into my own hands.

308
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:19,832
Relax, Mike. This will all be over soon,
and we can all head down to the museum.

309
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:22,293
The museum?

310
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,962
Yes. Your Neighborhood - our Neighborhood

311
00:13:25,296 --> 00:13:27,464
is being immortalised for its success.

312
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,008
It's all gonna work out.

313
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:32,011
I took the form of a 45-year-old
white man for a reason -

314
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,429
I can only fail up.

315
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:36,640
Oh, OK, our team is five minutes out.

316
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,934
Bad Janet, burn us some popcorn.

317
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,814
Help yourselves, everybody.

318
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,900
Hey! Hi. So, um...

319
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,445
those bro demons over there
think I'm some kind of great torturer

320
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:51,530
and they want my advice
on how to torture someone.

321
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:54,825
Jason is stalling by ranking
MMA ring girls with them

322
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,160
but I have to do something.

323
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,495
Eleanor, you're wearing glasses now, help me!

324
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,997
You know the answer, dude.

325
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,042
Lie your ass off.
If Rhonda can do it, you can.

326
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,421
You know, I once shoved a hot dog right down
the throat of the legendary John Wayne.

327
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:09,631
She even name-drops in Hell.

328
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:11,717
I told you, lies have consequences!

329
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,844
I will have contributed
to someone's eternal torture

330
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,805
because I disobeyed a basic Kantian
moral principle.

331
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,140
I'm gonna be sick.

332
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:20,684
And I don't want to go back to the bathroom
because they put mirrors in the toilet

333
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,227
and that makes you really confront
what you're doing!

334
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,356
OK, OK. Sit down. Take a breath.

335
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:28,400
Rub your lucky bookmark. Hear me out.

336
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:32,696
What if lying is ethical, in this situation?

337
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:36,241
What if, uh... certain actions
aren't universally good or bad

338
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:37,743
like Jonathan Dancy says?

339
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:42,206
Jonathan Dancy? Are... are you talking about
moral particularism?

340
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:43,499
We never even covered that.

341
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,668
You read on your own!

342
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,963
You think just because I'm a straight hottie
I can't read philosophy for fun?
