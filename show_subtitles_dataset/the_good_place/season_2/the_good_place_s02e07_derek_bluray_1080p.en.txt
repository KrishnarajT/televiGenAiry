1
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:03,167
Go back to the void, babe.
I'll be there in a minute.

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:05,003
OK. I'll miss you like crazy.
- I'll miss you more.

3
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:05,920
No.

4
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:08,631
I'll miss you more. Bye!

5
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:11,342
It's my first time making someone
so he might be a little bit "off."

6
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:15,888
Janet, you can't just go around
inventing people.

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:17,307
Get rid of him immediately.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,516
No.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,393
Eleanor told me to find a rebound guy.

10
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:23,396
I couldn't find one, so I made one.

11
00:00:23,479 --> 00:00:24,939
He's helping me forget about Jason.

12
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:29,277
Ugh! "Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason."

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,988
"Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason."

14
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:33,781
Ugh! "Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason."
- Honey...

15
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:35,366
"Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason."
- Babe.

16
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,285
"Jason. Jason. Jaâ€”"
- Babe! Don't be jealous.

17
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:39,162
I love you now.

18
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:40,955
And we are going to spend
every second together.

19
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,082
Aw...
- No! No, no, you are not.

20
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,376
Janet, no one can know about...

21
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:47,462
I'm so sorry, what's your name again?

22
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:48,546
Derek Hoffstetler.

23
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,300
If anybody finds out about him,
we are doomed.

24
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:54,594
He has to stay in your void.

25
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,888
It's our void now.

26
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:59,807
We moved in together.
- What! Can you believe it?

27
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,436
I got my own hanger for my jumpsuit.
- Already? I mean, that's... that's so fast!

28
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,229
Well, when you know, you know.

29
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:07,649
And we know literally everything.

30
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:09,817
We are so in sync,
we're finishing each other's...

31
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,069
Derek!
- Ah!

32
00:01:20,536 --> 00:01:21,496
Hey, guys!
- Oh!

33
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:23,122
Michael, you frightened me.

34
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:26,501
Jason's making me watch this horror film
about two ex-convicts

35
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:29,045
who try to rob and murder a neglected child.

36
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:30,880
Get over here!

37
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:34,217
Hey, I got some great news.

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,387
I've arranged for you to have a weekend
getaway.

39
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,931
I bet you're tired of being cooped up
in this house, aren't you?

40
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:41,182
I am a bit, actually.

41
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:45,061
All this time indoors has degraded my skin
from "radiant" to merely "dewy."

42
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:46,479
Me! Dewy!

43
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:49,982
Well, there's going to be plenty of sun
and fun at the private campsite

44
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:52,026
that I set up for you
at the edge of the Neighbourhood.

45
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,905
Here you go. Ah, I told Vicky that I'll be
torturing you for the time being.

46
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:59,409
So just relax, live it up.
Out you go. Here. Now, sadly...

47
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:03,079
Janet is still offline, so you...
you can't call her, OK?

48
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:06,374
The best news is, none of this is suspicious.

49
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,835
I don't know what's going to happen to us.

50
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:10,753
But I need to tell you something...

51
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:14,132
I love you.

52
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:15,925
What are you watching?
- Um...

53
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:18,136
"Cannonball Run Two."
- Again?

54
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,638
You watch that movie a lot.

55
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,932
Well, it's basically my favourite movie
of all time.

56
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,102
But you can never watch it! This copy's mine.

57
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:28,187
Uh-oh, I guess I'm still pretty selfish.

58
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:31,482
Help. I need another ethics lesson, quick!

59
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,901
Very weird energy
coming off of you right now.

60
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,194
Hey, guys. What you doing?

61
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:36,696
Nothing? Great.

62
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:39,198
So, Chidi, just want to double check.

63
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:42,785
How do ethical philosophers
feel about murder?

64
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:44,328
It's frowned upon.

65
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:48,291
OK, what if the reason
you want to murder someone

66
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,960
is to make your life easier?
That's OK, right?

67
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:53,004
Is there a problem here, bud?

68
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:54,172
OK, I'll just tell you.

69
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:56,215
Um... no.

70
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,134
Too hard to explain. I'll show you.

71
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,051
Janet.

72
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:00,470
- Hi there.
- Hey there!

73
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:01,846
Who the fork is that?

74
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:05,141
Derek Hoffstetler, PI.
- Derek is my rebound guy.

75
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:06,476
I made him.

76
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:10,730
Oh! Did you do that because, um...
of what I said?

77
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,732
Yes. Because of what you said.
- Janet...

78
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:14,275
Thank you, Eleanor.
- Thank you, Eleanor.

79
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,194
You know, you seem so sad.

80
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:18,112
Do you want me
to make you a boyfriend too?

81
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,822
Ooh, I could have a brother.
- Yes!

82
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:21,699
Based on your last 10,000 comments

83
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:24,285
it would be Stone Cold Steve Austin's head
on Tahani's body.

84
00:03:24,368 --> 00:03:26,537
Or vice versa.
- She's not gonna make you anything.

85
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:28,039
Janet, that'll be all.

86
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:30,082
OK. Goodbye. Say goodbye, Derek.

87
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,628
Ah! "Goodbob."
I hope we "same place" again very now.

88
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:36,672
His brain is wrong.
- Ah-ha!

89
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:40,760
Well, I definitely understand everything,
so...

90
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,513
No need to explain.

91
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,516
Mm!
- Mm!

92
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,810
Now, the goal is to tap the ball hard enough

93
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:51,854
that it goes through the wicket,
but not so hard that it goes too far through.

94
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:56,818
It combines both classic aspects
of British sport - whimsy and restraint.

95
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:01,239
Oh! So restrained.

96
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:03,741
You know, I believe it was Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain

97
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,661
who called croquet, "barely a game!"

98
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:10,748
It's kinda fun, I guess.
But can I teach you a different game?

99
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:13,459
In this one,
you just whack it as hard as you can

100
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:15,419
in whatever direction you want!

101
00:04:15,503 --> 00:04:17,171
Jaguars rule!

102
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:20,424
The Jaguars are very good!

103
00:04:20,508 --> 00:04:22,802
Ooh!
- Whoa, nice!

104
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:29,600
Mm!

105
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,814
Fore!
- Well done.

106
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:36,649
OK, here's where I am on this.

107
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:38,192
We gotta kill Derek.

108
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:42,071
No, think about it.
What if Vicky calls for Janet

109
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:43,990
and Derek shows up too?

110
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:46,158
She's gotta have a lot of questions
that we can't answer.

111
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:49,912
But Derek does seem
to be helping Janet get over Jason.

112
00:04:49,996 --> 00:04:52,164
Right? No earthquakes since he showed up.

113
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:56,002
If we get rid of Derek, then maybe Janet
will start glitching again.

114
00:04:56,085 --> 00:05:00,172
OK, if we can't kill Derek,
then we gotta break up Jason and Tahani.

115
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:03,676
If that relationship ends
then Janet won't feel sad anymore

116
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,553
and maybe she'll get rid of Derek herself.

117
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:09,265
Girl, you are a messy bench
who loves drama and I am into it.

118
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:12,810
I'm sorry, Michael.
But that's also ethically kind of dicey.

119
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:14,103
Here comes the egghead.

120
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:16,147
Well, look, Jason and Tahani
are happy together

121
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,400
and telling them that he was once married
to Janet might cause them harm.

122
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:22,653
It's not permissible to...
to ruin their happiness to save ourselves.

123
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:26,782
Wait, but isn't keeping a secret
from someone basically like lying though?

124
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:28,117
No, no, it's OK to keep a secret.

125
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,161
As long as that secret isn't harming anyone.

126
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:32,580
And telling them that secret
might cause harm.

127
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:34,248
Noice!
- Cool.

128
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:35,541
Good point, egghead.

129
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,835
I'll tell you what else
would cause them harm.

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,796
Getting caught and being sent
to the real Bad Place

131
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,176
to be tortured for eternity,
which will happen if Derek blows our cover.

132
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,639
I know! But we'll also be sent
to the real Bad Place if we do bad things.

133
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:53,601
I know it's tempting to take a shortcut,
but moral strength is defined

134
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:56,312
by how we behave in times of stress.

135
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:59,231
Has anyone ever told you what a drag you are?

136
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:00,399
Everyone.

137
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,234
Constantly.

138
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,491
I hereby pronounce you... King Jason!

139
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:10,701
Dope.

140
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:13,496
Where did you learn how to do this?

141
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,915
The Hertfordshire Academy
for Expressionless Girls.

142
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:18,417
It was a finishing school I attended
before Oxford.

143
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:20,461
And then of course the Sorbonne.

144
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:24,048
You know, I don't think I've ever asked you
where you were educated.

145
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:27,802
I went to Lynyrd Skynyrd High School
in Northeast Jacksonville

146
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:30,638
which was really just a bunch
of tugboats tied together.

147
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,223
Didn't you get seasick?

148
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:35,101
No, sorry.
They were tied together in a junkyard.

149
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:37,645
It wasn't a very good school.

150
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:41,232
For most of my classes,
we just sold dirty magazines door to door.

151
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:46,153
You know, Jason. Every single detail
about your life is deeply disturbing.

152
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:48,072
And yet, I envy you. Where I...

153
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:50,074
I was never allowed to goof off.

154
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:54,412
I never even had a friend
I could just be myself around.

155
00:06:54,495 --> 00:06:56,205
Maybe I can be that friend.

156
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,875
Or your husband!

157
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,293
OK, stop it.

158
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:02,920
No, no, no, I'm serious.

159
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:04,714
Will you marry me?

160
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,052
I say we just let sleeping dogs lie.

161
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:13,806
Tell Janet that Derek can stay,
but she's gotta keep him under wraps

162
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:15,766
so that none of the other demons find out.

163
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,937
Fine. As long as they fly under the radar,
and Janet stays happy

164
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:21,230
I think we'll be safe.
- Great.

165
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:22,606
- Janet!
- Because the truth is...

166
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,816
You always do this!
- ... you don't respect me!

167
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,152
You make a federal case out of everything!
- ... and you never have

168
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:27,945
because to you I'll always be
"that guy you made!"

169
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:29,155
Guys, guys, guys! What's going on?

170
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:31,449
OK, can we not do this
in front of my friends?

171
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:33,492
Oh, so they're your friends now?

172
00:07:33,576 --> 00:07:35,703
I'm stating a fact. They are your friends.

173
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:38,664
I don't know these people. I am out of here.

174
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:41,292
Oh, great, Derek.
- I'm gonna go back to our void

175
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,003
and I'm gonna try
and forget this ever happened.

176
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:46,213
It is not your void.
- Oh!

177
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:47,798
It is my void.
- Wow.

178
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:51,635
I know it's a boundless, barren nothingness,
but you are always there.

179
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,220
Fine, I'll go somewhere else.

180
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:55,389
Fine!
- No, not fine, don't go somewhere else!

181
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,850
OK. Yeah.

182
00:07:58,392 --> 00:08:00,061
We're forked here, aren't we?

183
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:02,855
Look, Jason.

184
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:05,983
You're lovely and I've honestly
had a wonderful time with you

185
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,109
these past few weeks.

186
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:09,320
But why on Earth would I marry you?

187
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:12,156
Well, for one thing, we're not on Earth.

188
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:13,783
Decent point.

189
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:19,997
Also, we like each other.
And I promise to always be nice to you.

190
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,416
OK.

191
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:24,376
I'll marry you.

192
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,004
But I need some time
to plan a proper reception.

193
00:08:27,088 --> 00:08:28,130
I mean, where will everyone sit?

194
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:29,757
Will it Michael and Janet
opposite Chidi and Eleanor

195
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,342
or Michael and Eleanor
opposite Janet and Chidi?

196
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,302
Let's just have it today. At the beach!

197
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:34,845
The beach is where all the best stuff happens

198
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,724
like, uh... swimsuit issues,
and "Saving Private Ryan"

199
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:41,727
and "Jersey Shore" and crabs!

200
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:44,271
OK. Oh, I hope Janet's back online.
- Mm.

201
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:46,565
- Janet?
- Hi there.

202
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:51,153
Is everything alright, Janet?
- Yeah. Mm-hm. Everything's fine.

203
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,446
It's OK. Yeah, I'm fine.

204
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,116
So, it's all fine.

205
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,784
How can I help you?

206
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,119
Where? There he is!

207
00:08:58,202 --> 00:08:59,328
- Derek. How are you?
- Derek!

208
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:00,871
Nice to meet you.
- Derek!

209
00:09:00,955 --> 00:09:02,164
Derek, get down from there!

210
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:05,000
I am not coming down
because I'm meant to come here.

211
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:06,836
- I came here on purpose...
- Shh.

212
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,338
cos this tree is my new house.
This is Derek's house

213
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:12,341
and Janet's not allowed in,
because I booby-trapped it.

214
00:09:12,424 --> 00:09:13,342
- OK, OK!
- Hi.

215
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,511
Janet! Oh, my God, you're here! Thank, God!

216
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:18,347
Derek, I am not talking to you right now.

217
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,431
I'm here to announce

218
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:24,770
that Jason Mendoza and Tahani Al-Jamil
are getting married this evening.

219
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:29,358
"The ceremony will be private,
but we think it would be totally dope"

220
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:33,571
"if you biz-natches came
and got turnt up with us afterward."

221
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:35,364
I think I can guess who wrote the invitation.

222
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:37,658
How come you never get
this upset at anything I do, Janet?

223
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:39,702
Do not start with me right now, Derek?

224
00:09:39,785 --> 00:09:41,662
Oh, I will start it.
- No, no, no, don't!

225
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:45,124
- Oh! Do not avoid me by going to the void.

226
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:46,584
No, no, no!

227
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:49,044
What a little bench!
- Argh!

228
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,172
Things are falling apart here.

229
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:56,427
Chidi, I understand the ethics involved,
but we need to stop that wedding!

230
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,929
We break up Jason and Tahani.

231
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:02,641
Janet stops being sad. Derek goes away.

232
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:04,643
Fine, but...

233
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:07,479
there's something
called the Doctrine of Double Effect.

234
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,565
In order to remain ethical,
you can't just go into this

235
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:11,108
with the intention of killing Derek.

236
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:14,028
Your only goal has to be
to spare Jason and Tahani

237
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:17,031
from future pain by filling them in
on Jason's past.

238
00:10:17,114 --> 00:10:18,324
No, I gotcha. I gotcha.

239
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:22,494
So, it's like ethically we should tell Jason
that he used to be married to Janet

240
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:26,373
and it sure would be terrible
if that ultimately led to Derek's death.

241
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:28,000
Wink.
- No, the winking is bad.

242
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,544
You should not be winking
or saying the word, "wink."

243
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:32,880
OK. We really need to kill...

244
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:37,343
We really need to kill any suspicion
that I wanna murder Derek.

245
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:38,636
Boom!

246
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,803
Wink!

247
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,472
You shouldn't be winking either.

248
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:42,681
Guys!

249
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:46,060
Tahani, you're so smart.

250
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:50,814
Every day you teach me something new
about art, and history, and...

251
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:53,484
and why I shouldn't eat
everything that smells good...

252
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,945
because sometimes, it's candles.

253
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:59,323
You're basically like a hot genius teacher

254
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:02,451
who sometimes has sex with me, your student.

255
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:06,622
That used to happen a lot
at Lynyrd Skynyrd High School.

256
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,082
But this time, you won't be arrested.

257
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:11,460
Oh, I love you, Tahani.

258
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:15,130
Brap! Brap! Brap! Pew! Pew!

259
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,345
Jason. I never guessed
we'd be where we are today.

260
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:24,682
Me, a prominent British philanthropist
with award-winning legs

261
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:28,102
set to marry you,
a swamp-dweller who once asked me

262
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:31,855
if the presidents on Mount Rushmore
have butts on the other side.

263
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:35,609
We don't make any sense together.

264
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:38,862
And yet, when I'm with,
you I can really let my hair down -

265
00:11:38,946 --> 00:11:42,408
metaphorically speaking, of course, since
I'd never have it up in the first place.

266
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:44,994
I'm not a factory worker.

267
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:49,665
But you've helped me to see
that there is more to life than just...

268
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:53,877
appearances. And I can't believe
I'm about to say this, but...

269
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,505
- I think I loveâ€”
- Wait!

270
00:11:56,588 --> 00:11:58,007
Stop the ceremony!

271
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:01,093
This wedding cannot happen.

272
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:03,178
This is not helpful,
but I have always wanted

273
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:05,597
to be a part of a wedding
that was stopped dramatically.

274
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:07,558
We can't get married? Why not?

275
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:09,768
Because... because...

276
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,563
Hang on a second. I can't do it.

277
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:14,481
Professor Buzzkill got in my head.

278
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:17,985
I'm just thinking about all the rules
I have to follow to stay ethical.

279
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:20,362
Someone else is gonna have to do this,
I... I... No.

280
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:23,449
Alright, alright, alright.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news...

281
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,952
Uh, I think you mean "Bad News Bear."

282
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:32,916
Before all the reboots,
Jason was married to Janet, OK?

283
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,420
That's why Janet's been glitching,
because she's sad cos she misses Jason.

284
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:39,506
In fact, she was so sad she... Well...

285
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:43,177
- Derek?
- Well, well, well.

286
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:44,928
Jason Mendoza.

287
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,056
At last we meet.

288
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:49,058
You've got a lot of nerve, buddy.

289
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:50,601
No, no, I'm Eleanor, man.
- What?

290
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:53,437
Everybody, this is Derek.

291
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,981
Janet made Derek as a boyfriend

292
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:58,025
to try and rebound from Jason.

293
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,695
Oh, I feel quite lightheaded.

294
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,949
Janet, fetch my dizzy couch, please.

295
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:08,619
Uh, Jason, Tahani.

296
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:10,662
You guys stay there, OK?

297
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:13,123
The rest of you, come with me, right now!

298
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:14,375
So, it's true.

299
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,960
I'm just some sort of consolation prize.
- Derek!

300
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:20,422
Save the drama for your mama
and technically, I am your mama

301
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:22,591
and I don't want it!
- Ugh!

302
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:24,968
Decision time.

303
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:27,763
Any second now, someone's gonna
realise we're all missing.

304
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:29,598
Why don't you just reboot all of us?

305
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:32,059
Tahani and Jason
will forget they were ever in love.

306
00:13:32,142 --> 00:13:34,478
It was a fluky thing,
it probably won't happen again.

307
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,230
And Chidi and I can forget, uh...

308
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:38,565
Anything we want to forget.

309
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,278
You know just like, uh... personal bloopers
that were embarrassing or, uh...

310
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:45,447
Days where we were very gassy, etc.

311
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:47,157
And then we'll meet back in your office.

312
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:50,035
You bring us up to speed
and we go from there.

313
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,287
No, no, no. We're not starting over.

314
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:53,622
We've come too far.

315
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:57,418
Our only options are
to reboot either Janet, or Derek.

316
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,421
Neither one is permissible
as your primary intention.

317
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:03,298
I mean, the Doctrine of Double Effect,
remember?

318
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:07,970
Well, man, I'm working with the "Doctrine
of Not Being Completely Effed." OK?

319
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:11,557
I say we just reboot both of them
and see what shakes out.

320
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:12,474
OK.

321
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:18,814
No, no, Michael, Michael,
please, please, I have a son.

322
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:21,233
He's also my boyfriend.
I have a boyfriend-son.

323
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:23,485
Please, Michael, no. I was just born today.

324
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:25,487
I'm a baby.
- I birthed him. I'm a mummy.

325
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:27,030
Don't kill a baby, Michael.
- Argh!

326
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:28,449
Would you kill a baby?

327
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:29,867
I can't stand this. I just hate this!

328
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,743
I don't understand
what you even like about Jason.

329
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:33,829
What does he have that I don't have?

330
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:34,955
A soul.

331
00:14:35,164 --> 00:14:36,498
And genitals.
- Ugh!

332
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:39,543
Here we go, with this whole "no genitals"
thing again.

333
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:42,212
You're the one that gave me
wind chimes instead of a penis, Janet!

334
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:44,631
This isn't about your wind-chime penis.

335
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,341
In fact, it's not about you at all.

336
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:50,095
I don't even know what it is about,
which is very confusing

337
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:53,056
because the whole point of me
is that I know everything!

338
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,976
Janet, can I speak
to you alone for a second?

339
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:59,897
OK, look. When you said
you were sad about Jason...

340
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,858
and I suggested, "Hey, find a rebound guy."

341
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:05,444
It's cos I thought
it was some sort of schoolgirl crush

342
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:07,905
like just some guy
you made out with a couple of times

343
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:10,699
in the walk-in freezer
of a Bruegger's Bagels.

344
00:15:10,782 --> 00:15:12,326
Not based on a real example.

345
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,953
Yes, it is. His name was Marcus Bicksburger.

346
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:16,955
Marcus? I always called him Ben.

347
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,000
Look, I gave you bad advice...
- Uh-huh.

348
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:23,045
OK? Jason was clearly important to you...
- Yeah.

349
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,631
and real heartbreak
doesn't have a simple cure.

350
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,257
Mm-mm.

351
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:30,052
I mean, you will feel better
after some time goes by.

352
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:32,596
I don't really experience
the passage of time.

353
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:34,848
I do use it as lotion, occasionally, but...

354
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:38,185
I mean, weird, but keep doing it
cos your skin looks amazing.

355
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:39,728
Thank you. Not skin.

356
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:42,481
The point is, to get through a real
heartbreak

357
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:45,609
you kind of just have to sit
with your feelings, and mull it over

358
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:47,194
and power through.

359
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,240
And you have to talk about it. Ugh!

360
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:53,742
Talking about your feelings is the worst.

361
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:56,161
It's so much easier
just to find a rebound guy

362
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:57,538
and have sex about your feelings.

363
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,665
I don't know if I want to talk to Jason
right now.

364
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,708
That's cool. Until then...

365
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,754
if you ever need a friend to talk to,
just know I'm here.

366
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:08,715
That's really kind of you, Eleanor.
Thank you.

367
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:12,427
And in case you were wondering,
Marcus is still at that Bruegger's Bagels

368
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:16,974
and he's the manager now!
- Good for Ben.

369
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:18,600
Marcus.
- Marcus.

370
00:16:19,393 --> 00:16:21,812
Derek, there's no easy way to say this.

371
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:24,022
I never should have made you.
- Hm.

372
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:25,899
I think it's time for you to go away.

373
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:28,652
I understand because you understand.

374
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:33,782
Janet, this relationship has been
the best seven hours of my whole life.

375
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:35,993
It's been the only seven hours
of my whole life.

376
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:37,369
It's been my whole life.

377
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:38,829
I made you this morning, we all remember.

378
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:40,539
OK, you ready to do this?
- Yep.

379
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:47,588
Janet? What are you doing?

380
00:16:47,671 --> 00:16:49,965
I imbued Derek with some of my thoughts,
and emotions.

381
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:51,717
This is the only way I can re-absorb them.

382
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,176
It'll just be a minute.

383
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:57,222
Dang it! That is some hot re-absorbing.

384
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:59,308
Can you get pregnant from re-absorbing?

385
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,770
Uh-oh. I hear wind chimes.
Look away! Everybody, look away!

386
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,064
I'm gonna keep watching,
but you guys look away!

387
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:10,319
Goodbye, Derek.

388
00:17:10,402 --> 00:17:13,739
From the moment I made you,
everyone wanted to kill you.

389
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,116
And then I did.

390
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,909
Goodbye, mummy-girlfriend.

391
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:20,704
- Bye, everybody!
- Derek's going away now.

392
00:17:21,788 --> 00:17:24,124
Does he seem a little bit, uh...

393
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,250
still alive?

394
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:27,127
Well, he's about as dead as he can be.

395
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:29,421
Kind of like he's in power-saver mode.

396
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:31,048
Derek.

397
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,133
Are you worried
you might start glitching again?

398
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:36,637
No. I think I'll be OK now that I understand
what I'm going through.

399
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,264
And now that I know
I can talk to my friends about it.

400
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:41,975
OK, I'm gonna toss this steamer trunk

401
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,435
containing the lifeless husk
of my ex-boyfriend

402
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:46,647
into a remote corner of my limitless void!
Bye, guys!

403
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,357
Derek!

404
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,653
I'm kinda glad we didn't get married today.

405
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,365
Me too.
Perhaps we were rushing things a bit.

406
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,200
I mean we don't even know
that much about each other.

407
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,994
Like, who was the first person you kissed?

408
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:04,373
The sexy mouse robot
in the Chuck E Cheese band.

409
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:06,291
Yeah, it was...
- OK, OK.

410
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,377
I think that's probably enough
"getting to know each other" for now.

411
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,711
We'll just take things slow.

412
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:13,131
I know I'm technically married to Janet.

413
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:15,759
But I don't remember it at all.

414
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:20,055
I'm sorry that it puts you
in a weird position.

415
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:21,973
And I still like you a lot.

416
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,018
Me too.

417
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:28,063
What happens now?

418
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,067
Don't know. Do you want to try...

419
00:18:33,652 --> 00:18:34,778
re-absorbing me?

420
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,039
Something wrong?
- No.

421
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:51,670
Yep. I've been keeping a secret from you,
about you.

422
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:52,838
What is it?

423
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:56,049
The thing is, it's not even harming you,
and... and... and if I tell you

424
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,843
I feel like it... it might harm you.

425
00:18:57,926 --> 00:18:59,720
So, uh, ethically speaking

426
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:00,929
I don't think I have to tell you.

427
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:02,389
Yeah, well... forget all that.

428
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:05,058
Um, this is freaking me out.
I'm losing my mind. So just tell me.

429
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:11,273
And you don't need to respond cos
I know you have trouble saying how you feel.

430
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:12,482
I love you too.

431
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:18,822
Wow, OK.

432
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:21,533
You just... said it.

433
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:26,204
And I just said it, so effortlessly.

434
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:28,206
I've never been that certain about anything.

435
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,710
I once even tried to rent socks.

436
00:19:31,752 --> 00:19:35,297
How did I say that, that easily?

437
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:37,758
I mean, I get how you said it.

438
00:19:38,717 --> 00:19:40,010
I'm a total smoke-show.

439
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:42,637
But how did I say it so easily?

440
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:48,101
Look, I don't want to talk about this,
but after everything that's happened today

441
00:19:48,185 --> 00:19:51,938
I think we gotta.
So, let's just get it all out there.

442
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:53,064
Um...

443
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:55,984
Well, yeah, I guess, do you...

444
00:19:56,067 --> 00:20:00,405
I don't know, do you have any feelings
like that for me again now?

445
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,619
I'm... I'm sorry, but I don't think I do.

446
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:08,705
S... "sorry"? Why are you sorry?

447
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:12,209
Cos I'm relieved, because I don't either.

448
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,002
So, all good.

449
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,713
I mean, I, I... I feel incredibly close
to you...

450
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:18,840
No, no, no! Dude, dude, you don't...
- ... in many ways.

451
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:22,594
need to explain yourself.
We are on the same page. OK. Good.

452
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,930
Hey, guys. Sorry, I, uh...

453
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,056
I know it's late.

454
00:20:26,807 --> 00:20:28,225
Can I talk to Eleanor for a second?

455
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,643
Actually, we're chatting
about something right now.

456
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:31,645
No, it's cool. We were wrapping it up.
Good talk, bro.

457
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,607
What's on your mind?

458
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,193
Uh... well.

459
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:41,321
Being ethical... it's hard.

460
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:42,781
And I kind of hate it.

461
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:46,076
When's it get easier?
- Why are you asking me?

462
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,452
Why don't you ask Chidi?

463
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:50,997
He's the ethics master. I'm just a newbie
and I still kinda suck at it.

464
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:53,416
Yeah. That's why I'm asking you.

465
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,461
I designed this entire torture chamber

466
00:20:56,545 --> 00:21:00,048
around the absolute certainty
that when the going got tough

467
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:03,218
you would give up.
That was the signature Shellstrop move!

468
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:06,346
Do you remember once
when your "change oil" light came on?

469
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:09,099
You just abandoned your car
in a parking garage.

470
00:21:09,182 --> 00:21:10,976
Of course.
- But here...

471
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,188
faced with the toughest challenges
I could throw at you...

472
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:19,317
you never once stopped trying to become
a better person, and I just...

473
00:21:21,069 --> 00:21:21,945
Why?

474
00:21:22,028 --> 00:21:23,738
I... I don't know.

475
00:21:23,822 --> 00:21:26,741
I mean, whenever
I would do something crappy on Earth

476
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:30,328
there would be a little tiny voice
in the back of my head, that would say

477
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:34,958
"Eleanor, don't grab that handful of olives
from the salad bar."

478
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,126
You know, "You didn't pay for that."

479
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:39,713
Or "Eleanor, don't spit those olive pits
onto the floor of the grocery store."

480
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:40,672
"That's not cool."

481
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:45,218
Or "Eleanor, that old man just
slipped on your olive pit and he fell down."

482
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:48,430
"Don't use the fact that everyone's
distracted to go back and steal more olives."

483
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,140
I get it.
- The thing is...

484
00:21:50,724 --> 00:21:53,059
I still did those things.

485
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:54,936
I just ignored the voice.

486
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:58,189
This ethics stuff - it's hard.

487
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:01,693
And it's confusing. It is such a buzzkill.

488
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:05,572
But it does get rid of the little voice.

489
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,116
Because at least
I'm trying to do the right thing

490
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:09,784
instead of the crappy thing, and...

491
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:13,038
I gotta say, man,
I don't miss the little voice.

492
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:15,248
Well...

493
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,168
Thank you for helping me today.

494
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:26,134
Wow. You, uh... you really
did just come here to chat, didn't you?

495
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:28,887
Just shootin' the shirt
with your old pal, Eleanor.

496
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,305
I guess so, yeah, why?

497
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:32,974
It's just a very human-y thing to do.

498
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:35,602
Stick with the programme, demon buddy.

499
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:38,855
I really feel like things are starting
to click in our little study group.

500
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:41,983
Mm.

501
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,572
Hello, Michael. Shut the door.

502
00:22:47,697 --> 00:22:48,698
Have a seat.
