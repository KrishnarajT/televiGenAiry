1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,848
We're on the same page.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,558
I wanna team up with you guys.

3
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:06,852
What? Why? You do? What?

4
00:00:07,228 --> 00:00:09,855
I'm in a bit of a bind
and I could use some back-up.

5
00:00:10,022 --> 00:00:12,316
So, what do you say? New best friends?

6
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:14,652
Stop it.

7
00:00:14,735 --> 00:00:15,861
You wanna team up?

8
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:18,489
You've been torturing us
and lying about it.

9
00:00:18,572 --> 00:00:20,741
Let's not get all caught up
on who lied to who

10
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:23,995
or which one of us created
an entire fake reality

11
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:27,248
in order to cause eternal misery
for the others.

12
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:28,874
That's ancient history.

13
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,668
It was happening until 20 seconds ago.

14
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,961
The point is that...

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,964
circumstances have changed.

16
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:38,509
And now, all of us teaming up
is our best option.

17
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,554
I love being on teams!
Oh, we need a team name.

18
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:42,555
Um...

19
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,557
the Bobcats.
- Great.

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,935
Slow down, ding-dong.
He wouldn't offer us a deal for no reason.

21
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:49,478
He needs us.

22
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:50,855
Why?

23
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:54,275
Because, as you said, you keep beating me.

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,988
Look, I built this Neighbourhood
as a way to torture the four of you

25
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:02,199
psychologically for thousands of years.

26
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:06,454
And you keep figuring it out
and taking all the fun out of it.

27
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:07,538
Fun?

28
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,000
Today, there was a new development
that really chapped my nips.

29
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,669
One of my employees is blackmailing me.

30
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:17,048
Vicky. She runs the clam chowder place

31
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:19,550
in the main square -
"A Little Bit Chowder Now".

32
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,219
- Oh, the place with the chowder fountain.
- No.

33
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,429
That's "Pump Up the Clam."

34
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:25,973
"A Little Bit Chowder Now"
has the lazy river of chowder.

35
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:28,809
Ugh! How did we ever think
this was the Good Place?

36
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:32,021
Vicky thinks that she can run
this Neighbourhood better than I can.

37
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:35,775
And she wants to start her version
in 30 minutes.

38
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:39,070
I'm supposed to reboot you,
erase your memory

39
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:41,322
and turn control over to her.

40
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:44,784
How are we supposed to team up
with you if you wipe our memories again?

41
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:47,078
Easy. I'm not going to.

42
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:49,705
You're going to act like
you've been rebooted

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,666
and pretend that Vicky
and the others are torturing you.

44
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,211
But then, on your own time, in private

45
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:58,339
you can study ethics, ogle mailmen

46
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,174
do whatever you want.
- Can I play iPad?

47
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:01,926
Sure you can, buddy.
- Yes!

48
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,136
Guys, there's no debate here.

49
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,098
My boss gave me two chances
to make this work.

50
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,060
Suffice to say, I tried more than two times.

51
00:02:11,352 --> 00:02:14,438
If he finds out, we're all in hot water.

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,731
Literally.

53
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,066
They will boil us.

54
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:20,736
We will be the main ingredient
in a chowder of pain.

55
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,280
Oh, dear.
- But if you help me

56
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:25,491
you stop being tortured

57
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:29,995
the Neighbourhood looks like it's working,
and I never get in trouble with my boss.

58
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:32,373
Everybody's happy.

59
00:02:32,706 --> 00:02:33,624
Who's in?

60
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,085
Human meeting. Bedroom. Now.

61
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:42,591
Oh, yeah, um, that whole no-stair thing,
that was part of the torture.

62
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,968
Let me... uh...

63
00:02:46,428 --> 00:02:47,972
Son of a bench.

64
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,856
Anyone have any ideas?
- You know, believe it or not

65
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,774
I actually found myself
in a very similar situation

66
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:02,194
a few years ago, except in that instance,
Michael was Javier Bardem

67
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:04,738
and the Bad Place was
Vanessa Redgrave's panic room.

68
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:07,825
OK, stop talking.
Do not talk again for 100 hours.

69
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,661
What do we do?
- We team up with Michael.

70
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:14,582
OK, hot take, but I like your confidence.
Tell me why.

71
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:17,042
He has a bow tie.
- Oh, no.

72
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,128
I always trust dudes in bow ties.

73
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,714
Once, this guy in a bow tie
came up to me at the gun range

74
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:25,342
in a Jacksonville bus station
and said he'd give me 600 dollars

75
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:29,096
if I put these weird turtles in my duffle bag
and brought them to Daytona Beach.

76
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:30,681
I needed money at the time

77
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:32,850
cos I had just bet my friend Donkey Doug

78
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:36,854
that I could chug a whole bottle of
Dan Marino cologne and not yarf.

79
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,023
And I lost!

80
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:41,233
So I put the turties in my bag

81
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:44,987
I hotwired a swamp boat to Daytona
and the guy paid me the 600 dollars.

82
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,908
My point is, you always trust dudes
in bow ties.

83
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,328
Aaaah!

84
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:54,914
Look, Michael's a liar. I know liars.

85
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,583
It was my job to trick people
into buying fake medicine

86
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,752
and I was the top salesperson
seven years in a row.

87
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,462
I thought you only worked there five years.

88
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:03,714
Proves my point! This is a trick.

89
00:04:03,964 --> 00:04:05,925
There's no way we trust him.
- I agree.

90
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:07,468
He could be lying about this whole thing.

91
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:09,553
For all we know, you three are
in the Bad Place

92
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:12,097
and I'm up in the Good Place,
where I belong, being tested.

93
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:13,891
How would that even...?

94
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,559
I don't know but it's possible.

95
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:18,687
Before we do anything,
we need more information.

96
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:21,148
We should ask him every question
we can think of.

97
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:22,566
Yes.
- Yes, we shall grill him

98
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,151
like the flank of an Iberian piglet.

99
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,237
I'm sorry, has it been 100 hours?

100
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:31,367
OK, man. We got questions.

101
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,036
First off, how can we possibly trust you?

102
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:36,330
You can't. But you have to.

103
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:38,624
Logically, you shouldn't
but you have no choice.

104
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:40,876
I mean, I wouldn't, if I were you.
It's a crazy thing to do.

105
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:43,462
But you gotta.
- What happens if we don't?

106
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:46,173
Most likely, I reboot you once more

107
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,093
you figure it out again, Vicky tells my boss.

108
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,594
He shuts everything down.

109
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:56,016
I get punished, you end up spending
the rest of eternity in the real Bad Place

110
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:59,061
up to your necks
in a volcano full of scorpions.

111
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:02,564
I'll tell you what I want to know right now
before we go any further.

112
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:05,776
Did the Jacksonville Jaguars win
the Super Bowl last year?

113
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:10,614
Oh, you're serious. Uh, no.

114
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:13,826
Will they ever win the Super Bowl?
- Jason, I can't predict the future.

115
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:16,662
But no. They won't.

116
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:17,913
OK, well I just have, like

117
00:05:17,955 --> 00:05:19,748
12 more Jaguar questionsâ€”
- No, you don't.

118
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:21,458
- Hey, Janet?
- Hi, there.

119
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:23,502
Do you have something shiny
Jason can play with?

120
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:28,549
How many different versions
of this place have we been through?

121
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:32,678
Uh, let's see... 802.

122
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:34,471
The longest one was 11 months.

123
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:37,725
Uh, this current one has only been
going for one week.

124
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,518
Boy, you guys barely know each other.

125
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:40,978
It's gonna make this tough.

126
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,563
What's that super tiny line?

127
00:05:42,896 --> 00:05:44,982
That's the shortest one, eight seconds.

128
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:46,567
It was a butt-reboot.

129
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,569
I sat on the activator by mistake.

130
00:05:48,861 --> 00:05:53,157
Michael, was I also rebooted 802 times?
- Yes, why?

131
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,117
Every time a Janet is rebooted

132
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,828
she increases her social awareness
and abilities.

133
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:00,998
I might be the most advanced Janet
in the universe.

134
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:01,957
Oh.

135
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,544
So, Janet isn't with you?

136
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:06,503
No.

137
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,673
There has to be a Janet
in every Neighbourhood, good and bad.

138
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:13,886
This one is an actual Good Place Janet
that I stole to help sell the ruse.

139
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,805
I guess it didn't work, though.
Because you keep failing.

140
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,766
Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.

141
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:20,476
If you're not human

142
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:21,518
why do you look like us?

143
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:24,772
Everyone in the Bad Place Bureau
of Human Affairs

144
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,483
gets randomly assigned a human body

145
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:30,361
so we can get the feel
of how best to torture you.

146
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:34,239
I gotta say, it took me a long time
to get used to the hanging bits.

147
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:35,449
Gross.

148
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,159
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter,
Eleanor.

149
00:06:37,242 --> 00:06:38,869
I was talking about my testicles.

150
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:41,038
What about soulmates? Are they real?

151
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,376
I don't know. I hope not.
I mean, pretty lame idea, if you ask me.

152
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,045
Mindy St Claire's is fake, I bet.

153
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,338
No, the Medium Place is real.

154
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:53,342
So annoying how you managed
to slip away from me, all those times.

155
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,303
Why even tell us about any real thing?

156
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:58,472
Why not just lie about all of it?

157
00:06:58,597 --> 00:07:00,724
Lies are always more convincing
when they're closer to the truth.

158
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:03,185
That's true. I crashed a lot
of open-bar weddings

159
00:07:03,268 --> 00:07:04,478
as Eileen Shelbourne.

160
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:06,814
Even dated a groomsman for a few months

161
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:10,317
so I had to keep the name,
and he got "Eileen" tattooed on his neck.

162
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:11,568
Seriously?

163
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:14,321
How are she and I in the same place?
- Oh, get over yourself.

164
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:17,074
Trust me, don't trust me, it doesn't matter.

165
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:19,910
We're running out of time,
and I'm your only option.

166
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:23,956
"We're running out of time
and I'm your only option?"

167
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:28,794
A lot of guys your age said that to me
just as the bar was about to close.

168
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:30,087
But I never settled for them.

169
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:33,549
Because my ex-boyfriend lived nearby,
he was obsessed with me

170
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:36,176
and he never slept because he was
addicted to Adderall.

171
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:39,012
There is always another option.

172
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:43,350
And yes, I probably could have just said
that last part but whatever, don't judge me.

173
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:44,977
You guys do whatever you want.

174
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,186
I'm out.
- No!

175
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,565
My plan only works if all four of you
are on board.

176
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,067
Then you better get cracking
on a new plan, pally

177
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:55,904
because so far, I haven't heard a single
good reason why I should help you.

178
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:57,114
Alright, how about this?

179
00:07:57,364 --> 00:08:00,367
You help me trick Vicky
and all those other goons

180
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:04,455
I can get you to the real Good Place.

181
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:11,545
There's a way to get to the real Good Place?

182
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:12,588
It's complicated.

183
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:15,966
It may take a while to arrange
especially since I'll have to do it

184
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:20,721
in secret but yes, yes, there is
a potential method of transportation.

185
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,097
Well, is it nice?

186
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:24,850
Is there a business class?
Can I pre-board?

187
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,602
Yeah, let's not worry about that right now.

188
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:28,937
I can get us there.
- "Us"?

189
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,816
You, Mr "Diabolical Torture Guy"
are gonna try

190
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:34,860
to join us in the Good Place?
- Yeah.

191
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:37,446
If I stay in the Bad Place, I'm doomed.

192
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,075
But if I rescue four pitiful,
foul-smelling humans

193
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,368
from eternal damnation

194
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,496
hit 'em with the big puppy dog eyes.

195
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:49,082
"Please, sir, take pity on me, I've changed"
and all that crap

196
00:08:50,042 --> 00:08:51,627
maybe I can earn a spot, too.

197
00:08:51,752 --> 00:08:54,505
We didn't deserve the Good Place
based on our time on Earth.

198
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:55,881
Will they even let us stay?

199
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:57,382
I gotta be honest, I have no idea.

200
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:59,593
But at least if you help me fool Vicky

201
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:02,763
your brains don't get erased every two weeks.

202
00:09:05,766 --> 00:09:09,019
OK, all humans who have not
already been suckered by Michael

203
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:10,646
another team meeting.

204
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:12,940
This is definitely a trap.

205
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:15,859
We figured out his game every time,
and now he's just trying

206
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:19,696
a new way to mess with us.
Teaming up with a demon is insane.

207
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:22,783
Maybe.
But I think we have to do it.

208
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,618
Are you forking kidding me right now?

209
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:26,662
You take a half an hour to pick out
a turtleneck

210
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,038
and yet this you're sure about?

211
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:30,374
OK, look, I spent my whole life trying
to learn about right and wrong

212
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:32,626
and apparently, I failed.

213
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,212
I want us to get better
and I want us to stay that way.

214
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:38,590
You understand that, right, Tahani?
- I understand nothing.

215
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:42,094
Hey! Same here!
- Michael, there's been a mistake.

216
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:45,514
I belong in the Good Place.
The real one with the good people.

217
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:48,517
Who do I speak to about correcting this?
- Me, and you're wrong.

218
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:49,810
Very well.

219
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:51,311
I would like to speak to your manager.

220
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:56,149
Listen, sweetheart, you've only been
in this timeline for about a week.

221
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:58,527
So I think I'm gonna fast forward
things a bit.

222
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:01,488
There's a very good reason
why you ended up here.

223
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:04,324
You never cared about the people
you were helping.

224
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,870
You did it only for fame or status
or to spite your family.

225
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:12,124
That is utter tosh! I had my flaws,
just like anyone else

226
00:10:12,332 --> 00:10:14,209
but I raised billions for charity.

227
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,380
I was a good person and I defy you
or anyone else to prove otherwise.

228
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,509
You know, in all the reboots,
I never showed you how you died.

229
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,096
I was saving it in case I ever needed
to really make you miserable.

230
00:10:26,305 --> 00:10:27,889
But it's hilarious.

231
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,558
Of course, I mean sad.

232
00:10:29,808 --> 00:10:32,978
But it might help you come to grips
with who you really were.

233
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:34,896
Do you want to remember it?

234
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:41,528
Tahani Al-Jamil, social activist
philanthropist

235
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:45,073
neck model and now cover girl for
"International Sophisticate Magazine."

236
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:47,200
The issue hits luxury news stands
this week

237
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:48,910
and regular news stands
the week after.

238
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,747
Tahani, welcome.
- Oh, it's such an honour.

239
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,708
I have long dreamt of being one
of the women or yachts

240
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:55,709
who grace your cover.

241
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:57,377
Let's begin with your sister, Kamilah.

242
00:10:57,753 --> 00:11:00,964
A woman who as you know was offered
the spot on our cover but turned it down.

243
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,634
I actually didn't know that.

244
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,303
Please, carry on.

245
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:08,513
Well, next week, Kamilah will travel
to Cleveland, Ohio

246
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:11,808
to become the youngest person ever
inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame.

247
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,143
Remarkable.

248
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:14,936
Is there a question?

249
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:17,064
Don't you find that remarkable?

250
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:20,275
Kamilah is very impressive.

251
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:23,528
As you know, she released
her debut album only six months ago

252
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:25,697
and yet, the critics thought
it was so brilliant

253
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:29,368
that the Hall of Fame decided
to waive its 25-year waiting period.

254
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:32,371
Sadly, I will not be attending
the ceremony

255
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:35,707
because I will be in Haiti
on a relief mission.

256
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,543
Perhaps we should talk more about that.
- Perhaps we should.

257
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:40,629
But first, another question about Kamilah.

258
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:43,048
Don't you think she
and I would be friends?

259
00:11:43,507 --> 00:11:45,467
We have a lot in common,
we are both Capricorn

260
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,677
and we're both only children.

261
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:50,931
I'm sorry, I forgot about you.

262
00:11:56,687 --> 00:12:00,899
Hey, can I get an Irish enema?
That's Baileys and Sprite in a ziploc bag.

263
00:12:01,274 --> 00:12:03,485
Excuse me,
do I look like a waitress to you?

264
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:05,153
Yeah.

265
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:06,988
Here.

266
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,377
Kamilah! Congratulations.

267
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,254
You have all the attention.

268
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:24,464
Once again.
- Who are you?

269
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:27,884
Really?
- Good Lord.

270
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:29,594
Tahani!

271
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:32,139
You're a cocktail waitress now.

272
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:34,349
Honestly, I think
this is the right move for you.

273
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:38,770
No, it's just that my own sister didn't
even deign to invite me to her little soiree.

274
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:43,108
So I had to weasel my way
in here like some common... weasel.

275
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:46,486
I was supposed to be in Haiti
being photographed helping people

276
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,698
but instead I delayed my trip by a day
to come here and tell you off.

277
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:51,575
No, you came to do
what you always do

278
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:53,994
make a scene and embarrass yourself.

279
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:57,372
So I'm just an embarrassment to you?
Is that what you think of me?

280
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:00,792
Honestly, I don't really think about you.

281
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,419
No! Ow.

282
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:14,931
That's it. Ah!

283
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,809
I'll bring you down!

284
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:22,147
Come on.
Come on!

285
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:24,566
Come down to the ground where you
belong

286
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:29,196
- Oh, no.
- Mm.

287
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,199
I died in Cleveland?

288
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:36,161
I don't think that should be
your biggest takeaway from that story.

289
00:13:36,495 --> 00:13:37,704
Is that really all I cared about?

290
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:40,874
Just outshining my sister
and gaining praise and acclaim?

291
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,211
I mean, I did gain praise and acclaim.

292
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:46,379
You know, I dare say on some occasions

293
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:50,759
more praise and acclaim
than my sister, Kamilah, so...

294
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,012
Oh.

295
00:13:55,555 --> 00:13:56,473
Oh, I see.

296
00:13:57,557 --> 00:14:00,393
Oh, God.
- Oh, come on, now.

297
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:03,146
It's not all bad.
Imagine you're me

298
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,317
and you're designing a torture chamber
for people who think that they belong

299
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,279
in the Good Place.
I mean, you were perfect.

300
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:13,907
But I've always wanted
to be perfect at something

301
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,159
I just never thought
it would be the perfect stooge.

302
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:18,912
I want to do it.

303
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:21,456
I want to become the person
I pretended to be.

304
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,415
I agree with Chidi.

305
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:25,460
We should team up with Michael
and all try to build a better Tahani.

306
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:28,964
Great.
Yet again, it's everyone against Eleanor.

307
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,591
Because everyone
except Eleanor is an idiot.

308
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:34,427
Why am I the only person who clearly sees
what's going on here?

309
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:37,764
It's not that we don't understand the risks,
we just wanna become better people

310
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:39,057
and this is our best chance.

311
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,853
Oh, I get it.
'Cos you're so much better than me.

312
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:44,896
That's what this is about?
- Hang on, don't lash out at us

313
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,898
just because of your innate distrust.
- Lash out?

314
00:14:46,982 --> 00:14:48,525
No, it's not about who's better.

315
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,445
I have no idea what's going on
right now, but everyone else is talking

316
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,573
and I think I should, too!

317
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:55,740
What is so funny?

318
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,534
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing.

319
00:14:58,118 --> 00:14:59,286
How do I explain this?

320
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:04,082
I'm basically an exterminator,
and you're cockroaches.

321
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,085
My job was to squish you

322
00:15:07,544 --> 00:15:09,963
and poison you and yet, somehow

323
00:15:10,255 --> 00:15:14,801
my very survival now depends on you,
the cockroaches, agreeing to help me.

324
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:18,305
That's funny.
- We're cockroaches to you?

325
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:20,515
Yeah. Or dung beetles.

326
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,976
I don't know.
Something small and gross

327
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:25,270
that creeps on the ground in its own filth.

328
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:26,938
Just being honest.

329
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:29,190
OK, OK, OK.

330
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:31,943
Alright, forget about him.
Forget about him, focus on us.

331
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:34,613
Kant wrote it is our duty
to improve ourselves.

332
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:37,657
So whatever Michael's reasons
for doing this, he's giving us

333
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:40,160
the best chance to improve ourselves.

334
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:44,331
OK, I have to admit,
you're making a lot of sense right now.

335
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:50,921
I need to just untangle all of this.
Give me a minute to think about it alone.

336
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:51,963
OK.

337
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:59,095
- Janet?
- Hi, there.

338
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:02,015
Call me a train.
Fill it to the brim with cocaine.

339
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:05,685
I'm going back to Mindy St. Clair's house.

340
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:14,319
Gonna bail, huh?
- Hm? No.

341
00:16:15,987 --> 00:16:17,822
- Why... why would you say that?
- Well...

342
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:21,034
you got a bag full of clothes,
you stuffed a bunch of pillows

343
00:16:21,117 --> 00:16:23,578
and a mop in your bed
to make it look like you're asleep

344
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:26,039
and you're literally sneaking out
the back gate.

345
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:28,416
OK.
I'm going to Mindy's.

346
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:33,129
I don't want to live forever in a boring,
beige house with a weird, horny cokehead

347
00:16:33,254 --> 00:16:34,881
but look at what you're asking me to do.

348
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:39,803
Make a deal with an actual devil
so that I can then do homework in secret.

349
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:42,639
And by the way, you're not my friends,
man.

350
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:44,182
We've known each other for, like, a
week.

351
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,558
You know it's more than that.

352
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:49,145
We've been through some version
of this 800 different times.

353
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,481
And who cares that it's only been a week?

354
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:53,900
How long do you have to know someone
before you do the right thing?

355
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:57,696
Nine weeks, minimum.
- OK.

356
00:16:57,862 --> 00:17:02,158
Look, bro, I don't owe you anything.
I gotta do what's right for me.

357
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:07,288
You can come with me if you want.
I got another mop we can put in the bed.

358
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:09,124
Good luck.

359
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,138
I got a couple more questions.
- Sure.

360
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:25,640
Take your time.
We're not in a hurry or anything.

361
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:29,561
How many times in all the reboots
did I ask Chidi for help

362
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:32,272
he refused to help me,
and then I had to get better on my own?

363
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,274
Never.
He always helped you.

364
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,526
God. Really?

365
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:38,903
Yep. No matter how I set it up

366
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,781
you found him,
confessed you didn't belong

367
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:44,075
asked him for help,
and he said yes.

368
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:47,162
Now his agreeing to help
was part of my plan.

369
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:50,957
What wasn't part of my plan
was it actually working.

370
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:53,960
Drove me nuts.
Pesky little nerd.

371
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,173
Stuck with you and always helped you
overcome your biggest problem.

372
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:01,760
Assuming that's my selfishness.
- No.

373
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:04,220
No, no, no.
It's that you never found a haircut

374
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:08,933
that framed your face properly.
Yes, your selfishness.

375
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:10,810
I'm not that selfish.

376
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:12,228
Eleanor, your cocaine

377
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:13,813
and escape train are ready.
- Not now.

378
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:15,190
OK.

379
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:20,945
I think Michael is a liar.

380
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:23,531
I think there's a 99% chance
he's forking with us.

381
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:27,077
But he's asking us for help,
so we should help him.

382
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:28,995
Because that's what Chidi would do.

383
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,082
That's what Chidi would do for me
or for any of us.

384
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:35,126
It's what I am doing.
- I know.

385
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:37,879
It's just you're talking about me
like I'm not here or something

386
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:40,423
and that just makes me feel weird.

387
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:42,467
Alright.

388
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:44,511
We're all in.
We'll help you.

389
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:48,348
You finally listened to reason.
- On one condition.

390
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,019
You wanna be on our team,
you gotta be on our team.

391
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:56,981
Which means the professor over here
is gonna give us all lessons

392
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:59,859
on how to be better people.
Including you.

393
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:04,114
Oh, no.
No, I won't be taking any classes.

394
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:08,660
I'm an immortal being with abilities
you can only dream

395
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:11,496
Yeah, and we're in Arizona, dirtbag.

396
00:19:11,663 --> 00:19:15,208
A human turtleneck, a narcissistic monster

397
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,044
and literally the dumbest person
I've ever met.

398
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:21,047
And who am I? Describe me now.

399
00:19:21,297 --> 00:19:23,341
We are all going to take classes.

400
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:27,345
We are all going to improve.
And the second you betray us

401
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:30,932
I walk into Vicky's stinky
chowder restaurant and tell her everything.

402
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:35,895
You agree to those terms,
and you can join us on Team Cockroach.

403
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:39,524
So what's it gonna be?
You're running out of time.

404
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,985
And we're your only option.

405
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:47,198
So it's all frozen yogurt places now, huh?

406
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:49,492
Yeah, yogurt was what we started with.

407
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:54,747
A lot of us like the first version best
so we went back to 322

408
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:58,960
perfectly matched human souls,
blended together in a blissful

409
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:02,755
harmonic balance.
- Well done.

410
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,301
I've only given this opening day tour
to you like, 800 times.

411
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:09,137
Hey, how's this for my
oh-my-God-I'm-in-Heaven face?

412
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:13,266
Not bad.
- Right? I'm a pretty good liar.

413
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:15,018
You really are.

414
00:20:15,393 --> 00:20:17,103
I've always admired that about you.

415
00:20:17,395 --> 00:20:18,313
Thank you, Michael.

416
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:23,359
Now I wanna introduce someone
that you're gonna get to know very well.

417
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,987
She was the top point getter,
so she'll be helping me out

418
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,239
around the Neighbourhood,
kind of like your mayor.

419
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:30,033
Vicky Sengupta!

420
00:20:32,118 --> 00:20:33,703
Vicky, would you like to say a few words?

421
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:37,707
Actually, Michael,
I'd like to sing a few words. Janet.

422
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,875
Hit it!

423
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:45,882
â™ª At first I was afraid, I was petrified â™ª

424
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:48,134
â™ª Kept thinking I could never live â™ª

425
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,886
â™ª Without you by my side â™ª

426
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,305
â™ª Then I spent so many nights â™ª

427
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,683
â™ª Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong â™ª

428
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:58,561
â™ª And I learned how to get along â™ª

429
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,522
â™ª And now you're back from outer space â™ª

430
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:06,444
â™ª I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face â™ª

431
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:10,448
â™ª I should have changed that stupid lock
should have made you leave your key â™ª

432
00:21:10,907 --> 00:21:12,700
â™ª If I'd known for just one second â™ª

433
00:21:12,951 --> 00:21:15,870
â™ª You'd be back to bother me
and so now go! â™ª

434
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:19,624
I don't know
how long I can keep this up.

435
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,376
I nearly cracked about 50 times.

436
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:23,795
What are you talking about,
so far this reboot is dope.

437
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:27,298
There's fro-yo, there's fro-yo toppings andâ€”

438
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,591
Oh, spoons!

439
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:30,301
Alright.

440
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:32,804
We should have a few hours to ourselves.

441
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,391
Vicky's working on her performance
for the welcome party tonight.

442
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:39,811
It looks like pretending to enjoy
her singing is gonna be half our job here.

443
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:42,105
I got her to tell me
how she was gonna torture you

444
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,606
at the party, which is basically

445
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,024
the same way I did.

446
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:50,405
Eleanor gets drunk, hogs all the shrimp,
insults people, etcetera.

447
00:21:50,655 --> 00:21:53,533
Whatever bad stuff you do
becomes the basis

448
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:56,035
for the chaos tomorrow morning.
- OK, OK.

449
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,039
So my job is to get drunk and insult people.
I think I can hack that.

450
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:02,792
Now, Chidi, I'm gonna need you
to act nervous

451
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,878
and embarrassed by Eleanor.
- Way ahead of you.

452
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:08,214
Tahani, just be your fabulous self.

453
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:12,010
And Jason, you're good old silent
Jianyu the monk.

454
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:16,306
So I told Vicky that I would handle
the surveillance on the four of you.

455
00:22:16,764 --> 00:22:20,810
That'll let us meet each day
for Chidi's ethics lessons

456
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:23,104
which will apparently include me.

457
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:25,231
Even though that's transparently insane.

458
00:22:25,606 --> 00:22:28,693
Cool. And, um, Janet
you're not gonna rat us out, right?

459
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:34,115
Well, Jason I've been thinking about this
a lot over the last 1.3 milliseconds

460
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:38,494
I'm not allowed to lie, but my purpose
is to make humans happy.

461
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:41,289
And since you're the only
actual humans here

462
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:44,459
I'm on board for whatever fun little
schemes you guys come up with.

463
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,961
OK, bring it in.
Team huddle.

464
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:51,883
The Bad Place is about to be
outsmarted by a cowardly traitor

465
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,178
four dum-dums, and a robot.
- Not a robot.

466
00:22:55,261 --> 00:22:57,638
We can do this.
Team Cockroach on three.

467
00:22:57,764 --> 00:22:59,015
One, two, three.

468
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:01,434
- Team Cockroach!
- Bobcats!

469
00:23:02,477 --> 00:23:03,936
I still think that's better.
