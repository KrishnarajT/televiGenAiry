1
00:00:01,252 --> 00:00:03,295
Last season on The Good Place...

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,215
In the afterlife, there's a Good Place

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,550
and there's a Bad Place.

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,844
You're in the Good Place.

5
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:12,179
Eleanor, you are my soulmate.

6
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,474
Chidi, you'll stand by my side
no matter what, right?

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,644
Of course I will.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

8
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,396
Wait, what?
- Eleanor, Chidi

9
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,940
I would like you to meet
Tahani and Jianyu.

10
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:23,983
Boop!
- Oh!

11
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,901
You booped me.
- I did.

12
00:00:25,985 --> 00:00:28,863
His real name is Jason.
He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.

13
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,657
- What's up, homie?
- The problem in the neighbourhood

14
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,242
is me.

15
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,245
You have all done bad things
since you arrived here.

16
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:39,331
The Bad Place is owed two people.
You can decide.

17
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,753
Holy motherforking shirtballs.

18
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,297
This is the Bad Place.

19
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:48,758
Except for you four

20
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,719
everyone in this neighbourhood
is one of us.

21
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,138
You saw us all on Earth

22
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,558
a selfish ass, an idiot DJ

23
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:00,728
a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud.

24
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,022
You thought we would torture each other.

25
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,691
The only thing you succeeded in doing

26
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,777
was bringing us all together.

27
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,321
That's it! My big mistake

28
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,532
was having you be soulmates
living next to each other.

29
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,951
Next time, I'll spread you out

30
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,411
so it's more of a slow burn.

31
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,747
I'm gonna erase your memories,
make a few changes

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,416
and start over again. Just gotta
get the boss-man to sign off.

33
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,461
If this thing goes sideways again,
you are done.

34
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,004
Do your worst. We figured

35
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:29,090
it out once, we can do it again. Janet.

36
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:30,299
Open up.

37
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,926
Because you know what, Michael?

38
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,179
Ya basic—

39
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,098
You, Eleanor Shellstrop,
are dead.

40
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:39,225
Cool.
- I'm your soulmate.

41
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,644
You'll stand by me no matter what, right?

42
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,396
Hold that thought.
Is it OK if I go work out?

43
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,358
I gotta stay jacked.
It's who I am.

44
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,193
See you soon.

45
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,528
Hi there.

46
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,696
I'm Janet.
I think this is yours.

47
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,199
After I was rebooted,
I found it in my mouth.

48
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:57,952
What the fork is a "Chidi"?

49
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,246
Why can't I say fork?

50
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,464
OK, here we go.

51
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,591
Confidence, Mikey.

52
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,635
Project confidence.

53
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,388
There he is! How's it going,
boss-man?

54
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,015
Enough chit-chat. Is everything
in place for version two?

55
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:24,019
Yup! We're keeping everything from
version one that made them miserable

56
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,689
adding a bunch of new stuff that
they'll hate.

57
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:30,860
For example, all the coffee is
from those little pods.

58
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,279
Diabolical.

59
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,450
Plus, they will all have new
soulmates, of course.

60
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:41,120
You gotta trust me on this, boss.
I've thought of everything.

61
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,998
I won't let you down.
- I think you will.

62
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,001
I think this entire project of yours
is stupid and doomed to fail.

63
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,962
I think you're going to be retired,
eliminated from existence

64
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,714
and burned on the surface
of a billion suns.

65
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,508
And I have no doubt that you
and your cockamamy experiment

66
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,594
will go down in history
as colossal failures.

67
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,429
You know, I think if—
- Toodle-oo.

68
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,557
OK, take two, folks.

69
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,893
Any last questions
before we start up again?

70
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,687
Yes.
- Just so I'm clear...

71
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,106
we're not pairing them up this time?
- Correct.

72
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:13,652
Obviously, the eventual goal
is to get them to torture each other but...

73
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,364
first we're going to create some nice,
individual torment.

74
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,534
In version one, making them soulmates

75
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,412
we probably bit off more
than we could chew.

76
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,914
We could bite them?

77
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,957
I didn't know we were allowed to
bite them!

78
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,043
That's an expression, Chuck.

79
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,377
Alright, go ahead, Vicky.

80
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,713
Yeah, I have some questions
about my new character.

81
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:37,343
I feel like I got Real Eleanor -
like, I got her, you know?

82
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,430
But this new character, "Denise",
I mean, who is she?

83
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,681
I don't get her.

84
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,768
Is she a quirky best friend type,
or more of a...

85
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,812
a femme fatale "sexuality is her weapon
of choice" type?

86
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,147
Both, both those things.

87
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,150
I have some questions
about my character too, like...

88
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,903
can he bite them?
- No.

89
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,154
OK, reminder.

90
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,949
The most important thing tonight,
and this is crucial

91
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,160
you need to get Eleanor drunk
at the welcome party

92
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,664
so she will say and do
a bunch of bad stuff.

93
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,624
And then we take that stuff

94
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,628
and use it to build our chaos
sequence in the morning.

95
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,713
For example, you remember last time?

96
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,715
She stole all the cocktail shrimp

97
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,636
and we made giant nightmare shrimp
fly through the sky?

98
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,098
See, it's those details
that make her realise

99
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,183
she's in danger of being found out.

100
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:33,065
OK. I know that this kind of large-scale
deception

101
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,067
is not what you were trained to do.

102
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,487
There are gonna be days when you're just
sick of being around

103
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,073
these disgusting humans, with their...

104
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:46,161
weird, gross little mouths
and their stupid elbows.

105
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,456
You're gonna be tempted
to say, "Screw it."

106
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:53,168
"Can't we just go back to HQ
and do this the old-fashioned way?"

107
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,463
"Pull out some fingernails,
toss someone in an acid pit"

108
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,301
"fire up the old penis flattener?"
And sure...

109
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,094
sure, that sounds nice.

110
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,263
But it also sounds easy.

111
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,434
We're all here because we believe
that there's a better way

112
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,436
to make humans miserable.

113
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,605
And I... I believe in you.

114
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,568
So, "torture" on three.

115
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,863
- Ready? One, two, three...
- Torture!

116
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,490
And biting!
- Nope! No.

117
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,459
Hey, lady?

118
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,586
Can you come back?

119
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:37,463
J... Joey?

120
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,757
Janine?

121
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,302
J... Jaja?

122
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,221
Why don't I ever listen

123
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,057
to people when they talk about themselves?

124
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,184
No, it's annoying, and I'm right not to.

125
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,062
OK, Chidi, where are you?

126
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,646
Or what are you?

127
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,566
A type of soup, maybe?

128
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,322
Hi there.

129
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,867
I'm Eleanor.
- Nice to meet you, Eleanor. I'm Nina.

130
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,452
This is my soulmate, Bart.

131
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,497
Love it.
Love people's names

132
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:14,500
and love learning all about them.
Where are you all from?

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,043
Well, oddly enough

134
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,212
I was born in Mozambique—
- Cool.

135
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:21,590
Listen, do you guys know if there's, like,
a Neighbourhood phone book

136
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,092
with everybody's name listed in it?

137
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,595
Oh, I don't think so, cos,
I mean, there's no phones here.

138
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:27,721
There are no phones here?

139
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,307
Of course.

140
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,892
Duh!

141
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,354
There's no use for 'em.
I always prefer talking to people anyway.

142
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,233
People are like nature's apps.

143
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,777
Huh.

144
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,696
Anyway, we're on our way to get some pizza.
Would you like to join us?

145
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,824
Maybe we could get to know each other
a little bit, chat.

146
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,700
Uh, I'm good.
I'm gonna explore a little bit.

147
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,994
But it was so nice to meet you Nina,
and B...

148
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,288
bye-bye!

149
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,128
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

150
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,381
Chidi?

151
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,674
Are you Chidi?

152
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,682
Eleanor? What are you up to?
- Oh, hey there, Michael.

153
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,809
Just getting to know everyone
in the neighbourhood.

154
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:14,768
Oh!

155
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,688
Who was that mysterious
gentleman wearing the nightgown?

156
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,985
Oh, uh, that's Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk
who never speaks.

157
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,362
Might be a little hard to get to know him.

158
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,741
Eleanor, you and I both know

159
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,786
that you're not like everyone else
in this neighbourhood.

160
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,082
Everyone here led a remarkable life.

161
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,793
But you...

162
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:42,963
the work you did
as an environmental activist

163
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,549
was just extraordinary!

164
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,094
Ah. Well, it's the environment.

165
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,513
I mean, I loved...

166
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,307
um... mushrooms.

167
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,934
I can honestly say that.

168
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,897
Well, it paid off, because you
were the number one point-getter

169
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,732
in this entire neighbourhood.

170
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,902
As such, I was just hoping
that you could say a few words

171
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,155
at tonight's welcome party.
You know, just to introduce yourself.

172
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,407
How can I say no?

173
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,659
Can I say "no"?
It doesn't feel like I can say "no."

174
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,495
But if I can, Michael, I'm saying "no".

175
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,914
OK, so, you'll speak for...

176
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,916
maybe an hour or so?
Hey, you know what?

177
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,460
I got you a little something to wear here.

178
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,713
Now, all the top point-getters
wear these on the first night.

179
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,383
Oh, you gotta be forking kidding me...

180
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,887
So, long story short,
my heart is in the Pope

181
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,516
my liver's in the Dalai Lama,
and my teeth were strung into a necklace

182
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,768
for a child-king in French Polynesia.

183
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,355
But it got me into the Good Place so,
can't complain.

184
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,232
Wow. Can I...

185
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,984
tell you something?
Just soulmate to soulmate?

186
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:46,985
Hold that thought.

187
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,530
I'm gonna head to the gym.

188
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,199
Oh, you're serious. Again? Right now?

189
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,160
Yeah. I'll catch you later!

190
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:00,332
Hey there, Best Person!
You must be Eleanor.

191
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,292
I'm Jessica, the host.
- Hi.

192
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,754
Michael told us all about your speech.
I can't wait to hear what you have to say.

193
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:08,382
Me neither, Jessica. Me. Neither.

194
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,717
Aw, don't be nervous. Here.

195
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,513
Liquid courage.
- Actually, um...

196
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,515
you know what?
I think I need to keep a clear head.

197
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,685
Can you imagine getting drunk
before giving a big speech?

198
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,563
Getting kicked out
of your niece's christening

199
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,565
and then, only later,
once you've sobered up

200
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,191
realise you don't even have a niece.

201
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,526
It's like, who was that kid?

202
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,780
So, Eleanor,
you were an environmental lawyer.

203
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,448
That's fascinating.
- Yeah.

204
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,367
I know. Just don't ask me any questions
about it.

205
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,619
I am so sick of describing
exactly what it means.

206
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,163
Hey, I'm headed to the bar.
Can I grab you something?

207
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,040
How about a margarita?
- No, I'm good.

208
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,043
Actually, I'm the best,
according to the sash.

209
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,590
She's still not drinking?
- Nope.

210
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,593
Something's off.
- Should we...?

211
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,636
Om-nom-nom-nom...

212
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,804
No.
- Mm-mm.

213
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:56,763
Keep it together.

214
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,144
Ah, screw it.

215
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,771
Couple of quick shots...

216
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,733
And then I'm coming for you,
shrimpies.

217
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,699
Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

218
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,829
These are for you.

219
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,831
Drink up.

220
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,752
Hi. Is your name Chidi?

221
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,128
Yes?

222
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,590
Ah! I knew you weren't a soup.
- What?

223
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,344
Listen to me very carefully.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

224
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,346
We need to talk.

225
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,897
Chidi? Come on in.

226
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,067
So there really is an afterlife?

227
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:55,030
I can't wait to have breakfast
with Kant and lunch with Michel Foucault

228
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,573
and then have dinner with Kant again

229
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,283
so we can talk about
what came up at breakfast.

230
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,787
I'm sorry, Chidi, all the great philosophers
in history

231
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,664
ended up in the Bad Place.

232
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:08,210
All of my heroes are...?
- Being tortured. Yes, I'm afraid so.

233
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:13,006
Actually, it is kind of clever
how they punish philosophers.

234
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:17,219
Every day, they make them
go to school naked

235
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,139
and then they take a test
in a class they've never been to.

236
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,059
And then they smash them
with hammers.

237
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,894
And that part is not so clever.

238
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,732
But the point is, Chidi,
you were way better than all of them.

239
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,567
You're safe.

240
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:38,031
No way. Soulmates are real?
- They sure are.

241
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,326
Although, your soulmate situation
is a little unusual.

242
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,329
Oh, no.
I don't have one, do I?

243
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,789
That's fine. I mean, who needs
a soulmate, anyway?

244
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,791
My soulmate will be...

245
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,376
books!

246
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,837
No, no, it's not that you don't have
a soulmate

247
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,506
it's that you have multiple soulmates.

248
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,216
Here. Now...

249
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,052
Normally, our omniscient system

250
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,638
perfectly analyses each person's profile

251
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,266
and then matches him or her
with another person.

252
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,769
But in your case, the system matched you
with two other people.

253
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,023
It's a rare occurrence,
like a double rainbow

254
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,610
or someone on the Internet saying,
"You know what?"

255
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,696
"You've convinced me I was wrong."

256
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,614
So, how do you choose
who I should be with?

257
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,241
Oh, I don't choose.
You do, Chidi.

258
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,286
I... what?

259
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:27,664
This is Angelique, Pedro, and Pevita.

260
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,334
According to the system, either Pedro

261
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,671
or Chidi could be matched perfectly
with either Angelique

262
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,548
or Pevita. So figure it out.

263
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:37,799
Should be fun.

264
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,470
Cool... beans.

265
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,221
One second, guys. Um, so... so...

266
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,264
So...
- Yeah?

267
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:48,477
So... making decisions isn't necessarily
my strong suit.

268
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,521
I know that, buddy.
You once had a panic attack

269
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,357
at a make-your-own-sundae bar.
- There were too many toppings.

270
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,111
And very early in the process
you had to commit to a chocolate palate

271
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,780
or a fruit palate,
and if you couldn't decide

272
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,158
you wound up with kiwi, Junior Mint, raisin,
and it just ruins everyone's night.

273
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:07,496
Chidi, I am so sorry.
I literally cannot choose for you.

274
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,541
This has to be your decision.
Buddy, you gotta trust me.

275
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,254
I would never place you
in a painful situation.

276
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,089
Right.

277
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,217
- Um...
- You ready, Chidi?

278
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,844
Here you go, Chidi.

279
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,472
One slice of Hawaiian,
straight out the oven for you.

280
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,599
I'm Denise.
Welcome to my pizza place.

281
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,768
Thanks, Denise.
- And here's one for you.

282
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:30,727
Have a nice day.

283
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,523
It's interesting that Hawaiian pizza
is so popular here.

284
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,942
Yeah, I guess a lot
of the residents here love it.

285
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,444
Kinda makes you wonder what type of pizza
they have in the Bad Place, huh?

286
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,074
So, I can't believe you studied in Brisbane.

287
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,910
We must have just missed each other.
What was your thesis on?

288
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,954
Oh, gosh. It was so boring.

289
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,415
It was called, "Cultural Relativism
and Moral Absolutism"

290
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,877
"An Exploration of Values As Seen
Through The Works of Alain LeRoy"

291
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,629
"... Locke and Immanuel Kant."

292
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,798
Shut up. You read it?

293
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,926
No, but that pairing
is the most obvious pairing

294
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,511
to employ in a paper with that title

295
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,721
and I wanna read it so bad!

296
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,140
What about Morocco?

297
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:11,601
You ever travel there?

298
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,146
No.

299
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,233
What about anywhere else?

300
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,026
You been anywhere else?
- No.

301
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,906
So, first impressions?

302
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,243
Anyone?
- I kinda wanna hear what Chidi thinks.

303
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,872
Well. Um, I mean, you're both

304
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,542
brilliant, accomplished women,
and Pedro, you're great too.

305
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,128
Just amazing people. I'm surrounded. Ah!

306
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:42,132
Ahh! But, if I had to say

307
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:47,304
who I sort of immediately bonded to
on a gut level

308
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,307
I think I would say that I...

309
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,476
kind of feel like my soulmate is...

310
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,394
Angel—

311
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,354
Wait, wait!

312
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,733
There was a mistake in the calculations.

313
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,737
We had a four-hour time gap
in your profiles on May 10, 2003.

314
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,325
I corrected that day's events for all of you,
and ran the numbers again and...

315
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:11,161
and the final result proves definitively

316
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,622
that Pedro is Angelique's soulmate

317
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,166
and Chidi, your soulmate is Pevita.

318
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,836
That was close.

319
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,672
Hey, you guys hadn't made a decision yet,
had you?

320
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,425
No! We did not.
No one said anything.

321
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,385
I didn't hear anything,
and I certainly didn't say anything.

322
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,887
That's for darn sure.

323
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,980
OK. Alright.

324
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,565
See you later.

325
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,655
This is fun. It's a fun party.

326
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,532
There's no question about it,
this is a fun situation.

327
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,868
Hey, you guys are here.

328
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,371
The fun continues, nay, increases!

329
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,748
You two look nice.

330
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,750
Thanks! And you look...

331
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:02,379
fine.

332
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,048
Would I say you look better
than anyone else here?

333
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,132
No, I wouldn't say that.

334
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,676
Do you look bad? No.

335
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,928
But good? Would I go as far as to say
that you look good?

336
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,930
Doubtful. Hey, wine.

337
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,432
Mmm. Uh...

338
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,976
Do I feel like red or white?
- Oh...

339
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,936
deep down in your heart of hearts

340
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,688
you probably already know
which one you want.

341
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,442
Why isn't anyone talking?

342
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,736
Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?
- Mm-hm!

343
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,369
Oh, hey!

344
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,371
Chidi, right? Denise.

345
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,208
We met earlier, remember?
- Oh, yeah, hi.

346
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,335
Are you limping?
- Yeah, I am.

347
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,628
Crazy story.

348
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,173
See, I was a trapeze artist
in an illegal circus in Bangladesh...

349
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,759
Angelique.
- Hey. How are you doing?

350
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,680
Oh, well, uh... Heh. You know...

351
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,766
My stomach's in knots,
I'm stress-grinding my teeth

352
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,977
and it feels like my soul is being
suffocated.

353
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,729
You know, just your standard
paradise stuff.

354
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,399
How about you?
- It's been a little uncomfortable.

355
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:09,029
I think Pedro maybe heard you say
that thing you were gonna say.

356
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,698
Oh, no. I'm so sorry. I...

357
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,450
but I have to ask.

358
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,995
Do you feel the way I feel?
- We can't talk about this.

359
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,707
Well, I know, but if the numbers
were that close, Angelique

360
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,208
I think I'm supposed to...
- Stop!

361
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,295
Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

362
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,133
These are for you.

363
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,762
Hi. Is your name Chidi?

364
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,390
Yes?
- Ah! I knew you weren't a soup.

365
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,351
What?
- Listen to me very carefully.

366
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,771
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

367
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,439
We need to talk.

368
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,732
About what?

369
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,568
Just shut your mouth, smile at me,
and walk over here.

370
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,447
OK, you're definitely my least favourite
person I've met so far.

371
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,116
OK, I'm sorry,
this is really not a good time.

372
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,242
I'm right in the middle of something.
- Dude.

373
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,203
I'm guessing we have
about 30 seconds to talk

374
00:17:58,286 --> 00:17:59,454
before someone notices.

375
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:04,084
When I got here, some robot lady
appeared out of thin air and gave me this.

376
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,461
You mean Janet?
- Oh, that's it! Janet.

377
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,796
Hi there.

378
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,130
Not now, Janet. Buzz off.

379
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,340
OK.

380
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,717
Now, I have no memory of writing this

381
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,385
but it is my handwriting.

382
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,054
And that's your name, right?

383
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:20,809
So, for some reason, at some point,
I put this note into

384
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,645
that whatever-lady's robot mouth.

385
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,939
You already forgot her name?
- No, I didn't.

386
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,274
Her name is...

387
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:29,692
Janet.

388
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,610
Hi there.

389
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,070
Fork off!
- OK.

390
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,822
- From the second I got here

391
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,490
these nerds have been acting real weird

392
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,825
trying to get me drunk.

393
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,702
My soulmate ditches me
every time I try to talk to him

394
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:44,707
and this Zen-master guy gave me
this magic bracelet thing

395
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,251
and then he just ran away.

396
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:50,630
Something very strange is going on here,
and the only person I trust is me

397
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,340
and me told me to find you.

398
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,468
So, what's the deal?
What's happening? What have you got?

399
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,428
Uh... OK, I...

400
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:02,392
Look, I'm, I'm sorry, but none of this
means anything to me

401
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,103
and I've got my own problems to deal with.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

402
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,649
Attention, everyone!

403
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,650
Speech time!

404
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,488
I know you're probably not a magic wizard
trapped in an amulet but if you are

405
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,157
please get me out of this speech.

406
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,251
Tahani. Come on in.

407
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,005
You're in the Good Place, Tahani.

408
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,966
Ooh, what a surprise!

409
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,969
But yes, I accept.

410
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,097
This is your soulmate, Tomas.

411
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,101
Now, Tomas was a doctor
with the International Rescue Alliance

412
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,478
and you raised money that ultimately

413
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,857
funded his medical missions.
It's just so perfect!

414
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,151
Wow.
- It's lovely to meet you, Tahani.

415
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,444
Charmed, I'm...

416
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,403
short.

417
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,781
I'm sorry, did I just say "short"?
I-I meant to say

418
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,327
"charmed, I'm sure," of course,
because I am charmed to meet you.

419
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,455
It's just an unfortunate Freudian short.

420
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:08,750
Shall we?

421
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,587
So, where did you attend medical short?

422
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:17,467
So, this is the living room as well as
the kitchen and the bedroom.

423
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,428
It's so... cosy.

424
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,431
I feel like the walls are just hugging me.

425
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:25,683
Michael, I don't mean to be rude

426
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,061
but this is simply absurd.

427
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,481
Yes, thank you.
I didn't want to say anything but...

428
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,442
There's only two of us,
and we don't need all this space.

429
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,778
- "All this space"?
- Oh, of course.

430
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,822
You two humanitarians don't want
anything so extravagant.

431
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,241
I'll just get rid of the second floor.

432
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:46,329
OK, I'll let you two have some alone time.
I will see you at the party.

433
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,293
Well... certainly is quite quaint.

434
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,754
So, it's just... fun.

435
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,675
I daresay even quite charm... ahhh, no.

436
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,385
What's the matter?

437
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,222
Sorry, it's just a self-portrait of my...
my sister.

438
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,184
Wonderful.
- Your sister is Kamilah Al-Jamil?

439
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,894
I used to play her music for my patients.

440
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,606
At times, it felt like Kamilah's songs
were curing the malaria for us.

441
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:15,942
Great.

442
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,445
Well, I best be getting changed for tonight.
- Mm.

443
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,864
Can hardly wear a day dress
to an evening event.

444
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,242
Sounds good.
I'm ready whenever you are.

445
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,328
Is that what you're wearing?

446
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:28,538
Oh, yeah.

447
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,417
My years treating remote villagers
taught me to favour comfort over style.

448
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,460
But you should wear whatever you prefer.

449
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,421
Well, I mean...

450
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:40,300
as we are soulmates, perhaps I,
I should also...

451
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,802
dress down.

452
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,309
You alright, my dear?

453
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,185
Yes

454
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,147
just not used to dressing
like a plumberess.

455
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,151
Is that what you call a female plumber,
or is it a toilet sweep?

456
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,236
Or clog wench?

457
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,531
In any case, that's how I'm dressed.

458
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:08,119
My darling, you are in the Good Place. Relax.

459
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,706
Feel the breeze on your feet.
That's why Crocs have holes in them.

460
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:15,418
I'll get us a drink. Lower that
beautiful face for me, won't you?

461
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,296
Lower-lower-lower-lower-lower...
Mwah!

462
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,426
Tahani? You alright?

463
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,219
Michael, hello! Yes.

464
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,472
I'm having a splendid time.

465
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,641
Although, if I'm being honest

466
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:34,354
a few aspects of my day
have been sub-optimal.

467
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,606
Really? Like what?

468
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,566
Well... my house

469
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:43,613
is a bit small, which is fine,
it's just not what I'm used to and...

470
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:48,117
Tomas is lovely,
but we haven't really "clicked" yet

471
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,620
to use a mundane colloquialism

472
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,080
which I suppose I should do

473
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,249
now that I'm wearing cargo pants.

474
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:59,587
Tahani, it's very common
to experience adjustment pains.

475
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:03,591
But the system matched you and Tomas,
and the system is never wrong.

476
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,886
But guess what?
This is the Good Place.

477
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,263
If you want your house to be larger,
then just ask.

478
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,891
Do you want something this big?

479
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,810
Or maybe bigger, like the Taj Mahal.

480
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:16,020
I know, I know. How about a moon?

481
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,564
Would you like to live
on your own private moon?

482
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,609
No, no, no. My house is wonderful.

483
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,820
And really, it's so silly

484
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,489
to want a bigger house of all things,
here in paradise.

485
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,574
So no, no changes needed.

486
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,867
OK, alright.

487
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,786
But if you change your mind, just ask.

488
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,664
Because all the other residents
are very happy

489
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:38,000
so it'll give me plenty of time to deal with
whatever requests you make.

490
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,920
No demand is too...

491
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,213
what's the word? Oh, "frivolous".

492
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,549
OK? Wow...

493
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:45,800
That is rough.

494
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,223
Please don't make this harder
than it already is, Chidi.

495
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,479
These are for you.
Drink up.

496
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,398
Oh, no, no, I...

497
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,900
Hey, hey, hey! Twinsies!

498
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:04,694
I'm sorry?
- Look!

499
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,071
cargo-pants buddies!

500
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,907
I bet we have a lot in common.

501
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:14,328
I was a garbage man in Winnipeg.
How about you?

502
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,038
OK.

503
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,083
Crocs also?

504
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,086
Speech time!

505
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,882
I know you're probably not a magic wizard
trapped in an amulet, but if you are

506
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,258
please get me out of this speech.

507
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,093
I've asked our top point-getter, here

508
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,513
to say a few words.
So, take it away, Eleanor!

509
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,689
The dictionary defines "best"

510
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,733
- as being—
- Oh, God, boring!

511
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,527
I'd like to say a few words if nobody minds.

512
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,154
Thank you, wizard.

513
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:51,199
I am Tahani. Tahani am me.

514
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,494
And even though I wasn't
the "number one point-getter"

515
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,330
I just wanted to welcome you all
to the Neighbourhood.

516
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:01,459
You all look so beautiful tonight,
with your regular-sized pockets

517
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,878
regular-sized soulmates.

518
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,506
Oh, no offense, darling, wherever you are.

519
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,216
Probably somewhere down there.

520
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,928
Why don't you try to ease her off
the stage and take over yourself?

521
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,305
The point is, we're all good people, right?

522
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:17,892
We all did the right thing
whenever we could.

523
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,811
And that's why it's so nice to be here
among you in this...

524
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,314
massive house that I want.

525
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,858
I want this house. Give it.

526
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,529
No, I'm just kidding.
But really, give me the house.

527
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,281
Hey there, hot stuff.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

528
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,033
Get your hands off me!

529
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,411
Oh, you think you're better than I am,
don't you, just cos you're wearing that.

530
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,705
Look at that terrible placement and angle.

531
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,666
Is this your first time ever wearing a sash?

532
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,001
Yeah, it is, but I think if we all just—

533
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,253
Well, give it to me then!

534
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,051
I got her off the stage.

535
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:02,311
Jianyu? Come on in.

536
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,983
Before we start,
I know you were a Buddhist monk

537
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,901
who kept a vow of silence.

538
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,321
Would you prefer to remain silent
here as well?

539
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,703
Every resident here in the Good Place
has a soulmate.

540
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:22,582
Now, some of the pairings are platonic,
some are romantic

541
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:26,210
but what you have
with your soulmate is unique.

542
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:31,632
You have a spiritual connection
that transcends the physical realm.

543
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,928
This person's gonna be your best bud.

544
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:46,063
Jianyu, let me introduce you
to your soulmate, Luang.

545
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,357
He is also a Buddhist monk

546
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,443
from the Lumbini zone of Nepal.

547
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:55,906
You and Luang share an identical
soul like binary stars

548
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,035
orbiting one another in a perfect,
reflective harmony.

549
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,622
You won't ever have a single moment
of loneliness

550
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:07,460
because you'll always be
right next to each other for eternity.

551
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,880
OK, I'm gonna let you two get acquainted.

552
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,634
I'm sure you have a lot to not talk about.

553
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,553
Because... well, you get it, you get it.

554
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,645
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.

555
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,856
Chidi? Are you Chidi?

556
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,072
Eleanor? What are you up to?
- Oh, hey there, Michael.

557
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,241
Just getting to know everyone

558
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,158
- in the neighbourhood.
- Oh.

559
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,661
Who was that mysterious...

560
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,142
Hello, you beautiful spirits.

561
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,477
Can I offer you two something to drink?

562
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:49,937
- Janet!
- Hi there.

563
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,565
This is Janet.

564
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,152
Now, she can get you literally
anything you want.

565
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,278
All you have to do is ask.

566
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:02,575
Of course, you two won't ever want anything,
because you're perfectly content.

567
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,536
Oh, I know.
How about something special?

568
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,581
Janet, two yak's milks, please.

569
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,040
Enjoy.

570
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:30,060
Speech time!

571
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,271
If we all just—
- Well, give it to me then!

572
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,026
I got her off the stage.

573
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,946
Tahani? Are you alright?
- Yes, fine.

574
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:44,074
Never better.
Top of my game, actually.

575
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,745
You'll have to excuse me,
cos I've got to go, so... Oh, look!

576
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,705
I've got some shrimp.

577
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:53,375
In one of my many, many cargo-pants pockets.

578
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,171
What the fork is happening?

579
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,345
OK, here we go.

580
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,306
How's it going, boss-man?
- Enough chit-chat.

581
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:08,933
Is everything in place for version two?

582
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,935
Yup, I've thought of everything.

583
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:12,978
I won't let you down.

584
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,564
I was just hoping
that you could say a few words

585
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,107
at tonight's welcome party.

586
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,859
You know, just to introduce yourself.

587
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,070
How can I say no?

588
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:23,572
So... cosy.

589
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,701
I feel like the walls are just hugging me.

590
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:31,789
How about something special? Janet.
Two yak's milks, please.

591
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,458
Why isn't anyone talking?

592
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,377
Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,549
Michael, may I please speak
with you privately?

594
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:42,883
Sure, sure.

595
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,888
It just feels like I used to be Real Eleanor

596
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,391
and now I'm Denise.

597
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,894
Denise is a good part,
with a great backstory.

598
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:58,148
You run the best pizza place
in the Neighbourhood.

599
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,819
You have a cat, and that's cool.

600
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,363
I took this job because it seemed

601
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,906
fun and different

602
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,826
and in the original version,
I got to break Chidi's heart

603
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,328
like, 20 times, and it was great.

604
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,372
I mean, he was miserable.

605
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:17,084
And now, Angelique gets to torture him?

606
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,794
Angelique is a hack.

607
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:22,590
I can act circles around her!
But I have nothing to do!

608
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,301
I am a Ferrari, OK?

609
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:28,387
And you don't keep a Ferrari in the garage.

610
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,472
I hear your concern. I do.

611
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,891
And I promise you

612
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,685
there is a great arc coming for Denise
the pizza lady

613
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,478
in about 80 years or so.

614
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:39,899
Chidi is going to accidentally kill your cat.

615
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,693
It's gonna give you a great chance to shine.

616
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,614
Can I just have something that makes me
stand out?

617
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,326
A mysterious past, or a limp!
I want a limp.

618
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,828
This is supposed to be the Good Place.
Why would...?

619
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,165
OK, I, no, I hear you.
I'll tell you what.

620
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:59,084
Go nuts. Limp your heart out.

621
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,797
Oh, hey! Chidi, right?

622
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,715
Hi.

623
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,008
Are you limping?

624
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,678
How's it going?

625
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,138
We're having some trouble with Eleanor.

626
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,766
She's not engaging in conversation,
she's not drinking.

627
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,267
Eleanor's not drinking?

628
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:19,855
She brought a flask in the car
during her driver's test!

629
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,775
OK, we need to keep things moving here.

630
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,027
I'm about to make her talk for an hour.

631
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,029
She'll definitely end up insulting somebody.

632
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,615
Speech time!

633
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,158
We're all good people, right?

634
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,787
We all did the right thing
whenever we could.

635
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,997
I think if we all just—
- Well, give it to me then!

636
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,337
Tahani? Are you alright?
- Yes, fine.

637
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:44,838
Never better.

638
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,007
You'll have to excuse me,
cos I've got to go.

639
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,342
Oh, look...

640
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,637
What the fork, man?
- I know that book.

641
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,181
Is that some kind of nerd pick-up line?

642
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:55,516
Because it's only kind of working.
- No.

643
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,059
The note you showed me before.

644
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,605
Alright, this is from a book called
"What We Owe to Each Other".

645
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,564
I used to teach it.

646
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,650
I was a professor of ethics
and moral philosophy.

647
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,568
Alright, brag much?
- No, I'm trying to help you.

648
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:07,653
Sorry. OK.

649
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:10,197
I have never seen you before in my life

650
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:14,535
but I think somehow
that we know each other.

651
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,081
That definitely sounded like
a pick-up line.

652
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,749
And I'm not not interested

653
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,668
but we need to figure this out first.

654
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,045
It's not that bad, right?

655
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,340
I mean, we got a drunken speech.
That's good.

656
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,218
No. It isn't.

657
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,638
Tahani gave the drunken speech
instead of Eleanor.

658
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,641
We can't build a chaos sequence
out of Tahani's speech

659
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,477
because she thinks she belongs here...

660
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,229
ding-dong.

661
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,232
OK, we can still salvage this.

662
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,901
Where's Eleanor?
- She's gone.

663
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:50,571
I can't find her anywhere.
- Maybe she left with Chidi?

664
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,573
He's gone too.
- What?

665
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,242
Or maybe she left with Jason.

666
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:58,037
You lost Jason?
How is that even possible?

667
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,498
Your only job is to stand next to that idiot.

668
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,667
I got distracted by the fire!

669
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,377
I love fire.

670
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,630
You know, my main job is
to burn people with fire.

671
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,507
What's up, guys?
- What are you doing here?

672
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,842
Why aren't you with Eleanor?

673
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,844
Oh, I told her I was going to the
gym again.

674
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,181
Why would you say that
in the middle of a party?

675
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,724
You told me too.
- No, I didn't.

676
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,393
You said if Eleanor tries to confess
that she doesn't belong here

677
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:24,271
find a reason to avoid her, like saying,
"I'm going to the gym"

678
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,314
so that's what I've been saying.

679
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,859
That was a suggestion
of the type of thing you could say!

680
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:29,818
Don't...

681
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:35,908
How many times have you specifically
told her you were going to the gym?

682
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,618
Five.

683
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:38,994
No, nine.

684
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,621
You dimwit!

685
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,538
Hey, man!

686
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:45,000
I was perfectly happy in my old job
in the twisting department.

687
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,295
People came in, and I twist them
until they snapped in half

688
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,797
and I move on to the next one.

689
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,216
But this job is weird!

690
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,843
It's all talk, no twisting.

691
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,012
So if you don't like the way I do it,
get somebody else.

692
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,723
I'm going to the gym!
- Fine. Yeah, you do that.

693
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:00,682
You go to the gym.

694
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:05,354
OK, we can still pull this off,
we just need to find the four humans. OK?

695
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:06,730
OK.

696
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,398
Right now.

697
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:15,906
Everyone in this room,
find those four humans!

698
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:21,161
Are you gonna talk, or just walk around
like a nerd

699
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,996
trying to get a personal best
on his Fitbit?

700
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,458
I'm sorry, I'm trying to process
a tremendous amount

701
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,085
of insane information.

702
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,878
I mean, you're not supposed to be here

703
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:34,007
but you and I clearly met here, somehow,
before now.

704
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,385
I mean... does that mean
that I'm not supposed to be here?

705
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:37,594
I don't know, dude.

706
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,264
Were you a good person on Earth?
- I... I think so.

707
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,808
I spent my life in pursuit
of fundamental truths about the uni—

708
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,059
Oh, no!

709
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,146
I used almond milk in my coffee

710
00:35:47,271 --> 00:35:49,606
even though I knew about
the negative environmental impact.

711
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,442
What?
- Eleanor, what do we do?

712
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,527
I don't know, dude!

713
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:56,572
But we better figure it out soon,
or we're doomed.

714
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,623
Uh, Janet?

715
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,916
Hi there, Jianyu.

716
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,209
Hi, Janet!

717
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,087
Um, can I tell you something?
- Sure.

718
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,214
I'm not Jianyu.

719
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:16,592
And I'm not a silent monk.

720
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,678
My real name is Jason.
And I don't know what's going on.

721
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,513
I got here and Michael said I'm a monk

722
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:23,765
and he told me I was gonna
have a new best friend

723
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,767
and that we were gonna live in a yogurt.

724
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,228
A yurt.
- Oh, yeah, "yurt" for short.

725
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,105
I was psyched to meet
my new best friend

726
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,150
but he turned out to be this weird silent guy

727
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,110
that won't leave me alone.

728
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,321
I don't wanna go back to my yogurt.

729
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,199
Can I go to your house?

730
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:44,328
I don't have a house, Jason.
I live in a boundless void.

731
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,496
Can I go there?
- No.

732
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:48,582
It's a boundless void.

733
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,459
OK.

734
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,379
So, what you're saying is,
there are certain aspects of your existence

735
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,882
here in the Good Place
that are confusing for you

736
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,969
and you're searching for someplace
to go where you feel less lonely.

737
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,513
I know somewhere you could go.

738
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,477
Why did you do that?

739
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,563
Because you were nice to me.
You're my friend.

740
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,106
OK!

741
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,485
OK!

742
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,113
OK, so, if we got all the way
to Scanlon

743
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:23,492
we must have been studying
very intensely for a very long time.

744
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,037
Or, you grabbed a random book of mine
and just tore a page out.

745
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,664
I'm gonna be honest,
that sounds more like me.

746
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:31,333
Ah!

747
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:34,127
Eleanor and Chidi.
What a pleasant surprise.

748
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,963
I'm so happy you two have met.

749
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:39,633
I'm just going door-to-door,
apologising for the commotion

750
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:40,676
earlier tonight.
- Ah.

751
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:44,346
The first night in the afterlife
can be a little overwhelming.

752
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,765
Don't worry about us, Michael.
We are doing just fine.

753
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,892
Oh, good, good.
Glad to hear that.

754
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,018
Well, it's getting late.

755
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:53,313
Chidi, allow me to escort you
back to your house.

756
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,315
Um...
- Uh, hello, all.

757
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,067
Sorry for the late hour, Eleanor.

758
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,695
I wanted to stop by
and give you back your sash.

759
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,238
That's OK.
You can just keep it.

760
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,948
No! I don't deserve it.

761
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:05,450
I made a complete fool
of myself tonight.

762
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:08,620
I interrupted your big speech,
badly stained my cargo pants

763
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,206
which, I have to admit,
are quite comfortable.

764
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,625
Oh, God, what's happened to me?

765
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,627
I'm praising off-the-rack separates!

766
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,920
Tahani, please. It's late.

767
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,213
I think what we should do is—
- No.

768
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:21,550
Look, ever since I got here,
it feels like something's been off.

769
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:25,762
Tahani. There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.

770
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,389
That's her soulmate?

771
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,182
Is there a second one of him

772
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,892
- that stands on his shoulders?
- Chidi!

773
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,562
There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.

774
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,272
OK, alright, everybody.

775
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,774
Now we are really imposing
on Eleanor here.

776
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,652
Chidi, let's everybody take off...
- Hey, Eleanor.

777
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:44,865
This person would like to speak
with you privately. About something.

778
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:47,075
Oh, really?
- Yep.

779
00:38:47,743 --> 00:38:48,702
Bye!

780
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,829
This is the wise monk
who gave me the magic amulet.

781
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,122
I gotta figure out what it means.

782
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,707
Could be the key to this entire mystery.

783
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,584
Luang, perfect, uh...

784
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:59,004
Why don't you take Jianyu
back to your yurt right away?

785
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,006
Homie, no!

786
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:04,009
I'm not spending another second
with this loser.

787
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,012
You said he was gonna be my best friend,
but he is not.

788
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:11,683
My best friend from Jacksonville
was named Pillboi and he was dope!

789
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:15,687
We would talk together, get high together,
throw old batteries at drones together.

790
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,148
But this guy can't hold a camel to Pillboi.

791
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,901
OK, I no longer think he's a wise monk

792
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,694
and I'm pretty sure
this is just a piece of garbage.

793
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,364
Babe, there you are. I've been worried—
- Let me stop you.

794
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,281
Can I guess?

795
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,200
You've been "worried sick" about me.

796
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:30,535
I'm headed to the gym.

797
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:35,457
Sure, why not?
- I'm quite confused.

798
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,127
Let me explain, gorgeous.
I don't know what this place is

799
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,671
but it is certainly not the Good Place.

800
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,924
Michael is forking with us.

801
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,635
Like a prank show?
- Yeah, like a prank show.

802
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,471
Except according to this note,
it's a prank show

803
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,181
we've all been on before.

804
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,767
What note?
- Apparently, I wrote myself a note

805
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:55,685
and stuck it in that Jackie lady's mouth.

806
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:57,729
Janet. Her name is Janet.
- Oh, right, Janet.

807
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:58,939
- Hi there.
- Hi Janet!

808
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:01,441
Hi Jason.

809
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,153
Are you kidding me?

810
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:09,199
Eleanor Shellstrop, you sneaky little

811
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:13,537
so-and-so.
That was some very quick thinking.

812
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,163
I'm extremely impressed.

813
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,500
And to be honest, I'm relieved.

814
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,963
At least there's an explanation
for why this all went south so fast.

815
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,382
But you're not gonna be so lucky next time.

816
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,008
Next time?
- What?

817
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,635
- Yeah.
- He's gonna do it again!

818
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,264
That's not gonna work this time, dummy.

819
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:35,058
OK, excuse me.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.

820
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,853
I demand to speak to your superior.
- I am so sorry, madam.

821
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:38,979
Please forgive me.

822
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:45,485
Well, as humans like to say,
third time's the charm, right?

823
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,323
I take full responsibility
for the false start.

824
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:54,494
But I assure you all,
there is no note this time.

825
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,663
I'll prove it to you. Janet!

826
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:57,831
Hi there.

827
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,208
Hi, Janet.
Open your mouth please.

828
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,544
Thank you.

829
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,381
See, no notes.

830
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,759
No clues or loopholes, nothing in there!

831
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,012
Thank you, Janet.

832
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,638
So, let's all just pretend

833
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,098
the last attempt never even happened.

834
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,684
Questions?
- Maybe it's none of our business

835
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:20,604
but did you tell Shawn what happened?
- Yes, I did.

836
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,148
And he completely understood.

837
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:25,901
As a matter of fact, he found the whole thing
kind of funny.

838
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,694
But he was very supportive

839
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,614
and he says he's very excited
for us to get going again.

840
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:31,615
So, anyone else?

841
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,910
Anybody? No?

842
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,496
Then let's get out there
and make some miseries!

843
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,084
Testing, one, two, three.

844
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,589
Hey there, boss-man.

845
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,716
You were supposed to call me
this morning, give me an update.

846
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,384
Oh.

847
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,887
Right, sorry. Yeah, it's just the, uh...

848
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,765
the chaos sequence was going so well

849
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:59,142
better than the first time, in my opinion.

850
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,853
Eleanor got completely drunk last night.

851
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:03,563
She talked for, like, an hour.

852
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,733
You know, even flashed somebody,
so we had a lot to work with.

853
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,861
So, attempt number two is on track so far?
- Oh, smooth as silk.

854
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:12,155
Everything's great.

855
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,991
Oh! Sounds like everything's going well
back there too.

856
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,618
We're trying out the new butthole spiders.

857
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,370
Ah!
- They're enormous.

858
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:21,373
You know, good old-fashioned torture,
the way it's supposed to be.

859
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,917
Good luck with attempt number two.

860
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,753
And remember, there will be no
attempt number three.

861
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,718
Eleanor.
Come on in.
