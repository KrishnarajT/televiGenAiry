1
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:07,873
Ya gotta admit, things are going
pretty well since I took over.

2
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:10,084
Certainly a lot smoother lately.

3
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,961
And based on my surveillance

4
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:14,088
our four humans don't suspect
anything.

5
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,382
Yeah, because we're killing it.

6
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:18,009
Wooo-hoo-hoo!

7
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:19,260
You sure are.

8
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:22,763
Here are the torture ideas you asked me
to write up for next week.

9
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:24,432
Ugh...

10
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:26,017
So long.

11
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:27,810
You're not supposed to be torturing me.

12
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:32,023
From now on, make all your memos one page,
max... with pictures.

13
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:37,069
Also, Quinston over here already came up with
a sick idea for how to torture Tahani.

14
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:38,070
Tell him, babe.

15
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:40,740
We're gonna have Tahani throw a party
for Gunnar's birthday

16
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:44,118
but no one will show up,
because we'll also be throwing a party

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,453
and it'll be way better!

18
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:46,954
Boom!

19
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:49,415
Where do you get these incredible ideas?

20
00:00:49,457 --> 00:00:50,499
That one just came to me.

21
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:53,252
- It just, like, popped right into my noodle.
- Yeah, that's right!

22
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:56,255
- Up top!
- Oh!

23
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:57,590
So, that's their plan.

24
00:00:57,882 --> 00:00:59,508
This doesn't seem so bad.

25
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,969
Yeah, it really tugs my nuggets.

26
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:04,263
I worked so hard on my torture ideas

27
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:05,639
and theirs are so basic.

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,225
These Millennials, they have no work ethic.

29
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,394
Oh, sorry, a...

30
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,980
a "millennial" is someone who's only been
torturing people

31
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:14,231
for a thousand years.

32
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:16,108
"Millennial."

33
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,325
OK, coast is clear.

34
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:26,410
Not a demon in sight.

35
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:27,661
Except for, you know...

36
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:29,747
Is that what we should call you?
"Demon?"

37
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,167
Well, I mean, it's not really accurate
and we consider it to be...

38
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,418
a little racist.

39
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,336
But it's fine.

40
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,756
Well, um, let's start our first lesson.

41
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,302
Tahani and Jason will have to make it up
since they're both off being fake-tortured.

42
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:48,557
I'd like to mention again that a "being"
like me studying human ethics is pointless.

43
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,603
Wouldn't you rather I work on the plans
to get us all to the real Good Place?

44
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,687
Nope.

45
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,856
This is school, that's your after-school job.

46
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:58,818
If I could bartend when I was 11,
you can handle this.

47
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:01,487
Alright, well, I've read everything
on your syllabus

48
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:03,614
and how... how do I put this delicately?

49
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:04,865
It's all...

50
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:06,450
stupid garbage.

51
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:10,162
Ah, well, are there any philosophers
that you found interesting?

52
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:12,540
Lao-Tzu? Buddha? Plato?

53
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,624
Nope. No.

54
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,167
They're all dumdums.

55
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:17,253
And terrible writers!

56
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:18,879
So hard to understand.

57
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,714
I am with you there, dog.

58
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:23,008
- Mm.
- Look, we have to start somewhere

59
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,261
so how about Socrates?

60
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,428
alright, alright...

61
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,931
let me just get into the mind-set of a human.

62
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:31,851
"Ha, ha... Oh, I'm a human..."

63
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:34,937
"and my breathing tube
is next to my eating tube."

64
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:38,732
"Oh, and look!
My arms end in stupid little sticks!"

65
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:41,277
OK. Proceed.

66
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,528
Good.

67
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:44,655
Ugh, this is so depressing.

68
00:02:45,072 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm being forced to throw a party
that I know will fail.

69
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:51,579
Well, why don't you let me handle it?
I'm great at failing at stuff. Uh, Janet?

70
00:02:51,662 --> 00:02:52,872
Hi there!

71
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:54,999
Hi! Me and Tahani are throwing a rager.

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,750
So, we're going to need the essentials

73
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,836
chips, salsa, a tank of nitrous

74
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,837
a treasure map

75
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,505
water-skis, a boat, water

76
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:02,882
those zappy-paddles for your chest

77
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,049
a big snake, obviously...

78
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,219
No, no, no, ignore all of that, Janet.
Please just design a basic dinner party.

79
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:12,308
I know this sucks, but I think you're great
at throwing parties.

80
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,185
That's why they're doing this.

81
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,436
It's what you're best at.

82
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:19,773
Just like I'm the best at getting empty water
bottles to stay on the roof of a Pizza Hut.

83
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,108
You know what?

84
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:22,818
You're absolutely right.

85
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,570
We should get a big snake?
- No.

86
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:26,780
I am the best at planning parties.

87
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,783
Vicky may be some demonic torturer
from the netherworld

88
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:32,077
but does she have taste, sophistication

89
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,413
an encyclopaedic knowledge of
traditional and avant-garde

90
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:35,372
Belgian floral design?

91
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:37,082
Yes, she does!

92
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,586
No, she doesn't.

93
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:45,049
What if I throw a party that is so amazing
that it's actually better than the party

94
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,594
that's supposed to win? When they realise
they could have come to my party

95
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:50,262
they'll be sad. I won't be sad.

96
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:51,555
They'll be sad!

97
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:52,473
Janet?

98
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:53,390
Hi there!

99
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,100
Janet, when I turned 18

100
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:57,853
I knelt in front of Princess Grace's
dress mausoleum

101
00:03:57,895 --> 00:04:00,314
and I swore to uphold the Hostess Code.

102
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:02,858
"I, Tahani Al-Jamil"

103
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,319
"shall do my level best"

104
00:04:05,402 --> 00:04:08,405
"to make every event too much."

105
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:13,327
Model tonight's decor after my 2008
fundraiser for the Red Cross in Zurich.

106
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:16,705
No... 2007!

107
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,837
Man...

108
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,006
Michael is not into your class.

109
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,716
Right now, I'm the best student.

110
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,344
I'm gonna be the velociraptor.

111
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:33,722
You trying to say, "Valedictorian?"
- No.

112
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,432
Look, dude, this isn't your fault.

113
00:04:35,474 --> 00:04:39,019
You've been teaching him ethics
for half an hour and he's been evil since...

114
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:40,187
the beginning of time.

115
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:42,064
Oh!

116
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:45,442
Maybe the reason Michael can't latch onto
the ideas is because he's immortal.

117
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:48,445
Look, if you live forever, then ethics
don't matter to you

118
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:51,323
because basically there's no consequences
for your actions.

119
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:52,825
You tell a lie, who cares?

120
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:54,660
Wait a few trillion years,
the guilt will fade.

121
00:04:54,952 --> 00:04:56,870
Before I can teach Michael to be good

122
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,999
I have to force him to think about what
we used to think about

123
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,586
that life has an end, and therefore
our actions have meaning.

124
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,130
That's what you used to think about?

125
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:09,133
I used to think about how
it's weird they don't make pants

126
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:12,469
that are just one big pant leg
for both your legs.

127
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:13,887
You mean a skirt?

128
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:15,681
No! Th...

129
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,851
You're not getting it. And my thing
is different, so shut up.

130
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,102
- Michael.
- Yep.

131
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,146
Is there any way that you can die?

132
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:23,105
Yeah.

133
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,356
Actually, there is.

134
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:25,649
It's called, "retirement."

135
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:28,986
It's rare, but when one of us really screws
something up...

136
00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:31,905
And, uh, what happens exactly?

137
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:34,366
Well... it's fairly straightforward

138
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:38,704
my essence would be scooped out of my body
with a flaming ladle

139
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:42,416
and every molecule in my body would be
placed on the surface

140
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,709
of a different sun.

141
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,835
Sure.

142
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:47,838
So, is... is that what would
happen if your boss found out

143
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,798
that you defected to our side?
- Yeah.

144
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,051
OK, so that might actually happen.

145
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:55,888
And if it did, there would be no more
"Michael."

146
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:57,848
Think about that for a second.

147
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,643
Imagine being retired.

148
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,438
Everyone else is here, but you, poof.

149
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,023
Gone. Nothingness.

150
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,275
Inky black void. Done.

151
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,695
OK, I'll think about that.

152
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,327
Huh.

153
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:23,290
So, you're saying I would be...

154
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:28,337
no...

155
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:30,839
me?

156
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:43,560
OK!

157
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:45,229
Now, we're getting somewhere.

158
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:49,108
Dude, you broke Michael!

159
00:06:49,316 --> 00:06:50,776
No, no, this is good.

160
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:52,653
He's having an existential crisis!

161
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,739
It's a sort of anguish people go through
when they contemplate

162
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:58,450
the silent indifference of our
empty universe.

163
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:00,828
Look, the good news is...

164
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,663
if he can work through this

165
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:05,666
it's the first step towards understanding
human ethics!

166
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:06,959
And what if he can't?

167
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,336
Well, then he'll be a lifeless shell
of misery forever

168
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:10,629
and we're all doomed.

169
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:14,133
OK, I will be right back.

170
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,968
Gonna go grab some Kamu!

171
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:18,387
Hey, buddy.

172
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:20,389
How ya doin'?

173
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:22,099
Can I get you a snack?

174
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:24,476
Do you eat? I can never remember.
What do you eat?

175
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:25,519
Babies?

176
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:27,479
You want me to get you a big fat baby?

177
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:28,522
What flavour baby?

178
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,899
How about a Cool Ranch Baby?

179
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:34,194
Searching for meaning
is philosophical suicide.

180
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,280
How does anyone do anything

181
00:07:36,613 --> 00:07:40,367
when you understand the fleeting nature
of existence?

182
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,244
It's pretty easy, man.

183
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:44,329
I mean, you learn about death
when you're a kid

184
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,915
and it's just not that big a deal.

185
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,757
Eleanor, baby, I have some sad news.

186
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,761
Your doggie Max has passed away.
Do you know what that means?

187
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:03,640
Well, sometimes when a dog is very old

188
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:06,185
like, five or six or something

189
00:08:06,477 --> 00:08:09,062
he crosses a long rainbow bridge

190
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:12,274
and at the end of that bridge
is a beautiful farm

191
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:14,776
with lots of grass and trees and...

192
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,613
I dunno, wagons, and a rainbow?

193
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:19,239
I already said "rainbow"...

194
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:22,159
The point is, that's where Max is.

195
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,119
Can we visit him at the farm?

196
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:27,623
Nope, because it's very far away

197
00:08:27,998 --> 00:08:28,874
in...

198
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:29,917
Guam.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,876
It's in Guam.

200
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,127
Can we have—
- OK, look!

201
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,462
I'm lying, OK?

202
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,714
Ya caught me, congratulations.

203
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,966
The farm is made up, the bridge is made up

204
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:39,885
there's no such place as "Guam."

205
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,679
Your dog Max is dead in a duffel bag
under the deck.

206
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,681
How did he die?

207
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:46,767
The short answer is, I don't know.

208
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:52,314
And the slightly longer answer is,
I didn't know how hot it gets

209
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:53,690
in cars sometimes.

210
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:56,235
The point is, don't be sad.

211
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,279
Honestly, I'll get kind of annoyed
if you do get sad

212
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,199
because it's been a very long day,
and that bitch Carol

213
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:06,245
from work was really on my ass
about some stupid thing

214
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:07,704
that I don't even know what it was

215
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:11,124
and at the end of that long day,
I had to use one of my favourite duffel bags

216
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,628
to do something very gross
that I did not like.

217
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:18,549
Now, let's celebrate that dead dog's life
by bringing Mummy

218
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,925
another bottle of white.

219
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,386
Pinot Grigio or Chardonnay?

220
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:23,345
Surprise me!

221
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,514
Oh, what am I thinking? Pinot.

222
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,933
Mumma thirsty for that Peen Greej.

223
00:09:27,975 --> 00:09:28,850
Go.

224
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:32,521
Hey there, buddy.

225
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,106
You feeling kinda empty?

226
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:36,191
Like there's a gaping chasm in your soul?

227
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:40,737
A tumbleweed, blowing aimlessly
through a vast desert of nothingness?

228
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:41,822
Mm-hmm.

229
00:09:41,863 --> 00:09:44,074
You think that nothing we do matters, right?

230
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,617
Yeah.
- Well, here's the thing.

231
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,621
life isn't meaningless
and you are the very proof of that!

232
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:51,832
I used to feel the way you feel right now

233
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:54,668
but it turns out everything we did
on Earth mattered.

234
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:58,714
In fact, actions had an actual point value!

235
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,592
So life had a tangible meaning

236
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,761
which means that you don't have to
feel this way anymore, buddy!

237
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:06,763
Existential crisis solved.

238
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,516
You're right.

239
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,393
Your lives aren't meaningless.

240
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:14,438
Everything on Earth counted for something.
- Sure did.

241
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:21,236
The same is not true here in the afterlife,
where I exist

242
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,071
and have always existed.

243
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:24,615
OK!

244
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:28,535
But, there has to be some sort of
value system, right?

245
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:31,079
I mean, how else do you
judge the value of your actions

246
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:32,247
outside of work?

247
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:34,416
There is no "outside of work."

248
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,836
None of us exist outside our jobs.

249
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:42,174
We have no homes, we have no hobbies,
or relationships.

250
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:44,468
We get the names of people to torture

251
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,053
we torture them

252
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,679
we get more names.

253
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:49,514
Ah, OK.

254
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:52,976
So... you don't actually know
if there's any purpose

255
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,896
or... or larger meaning in all of this?

256
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:57,689
Nope.
- Cool.

257
00:10:58,482 --> 00:10:59,358
Cool.

258
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,069
I would say I outdid myself, but...

259
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:06,031
I'm always this good,
so I simply "did" myself.

260
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:09,826
Everything is perfect.

261
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:11,703
Red alert. Red alert.

262
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,872
We need help.
- What's wrong with Michael?

263
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:14,956
Uh-oh. I know that look.

264
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,709
He just snorted a bunch of printer toner.
Mike, listen to me.

265
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:20,420
You have nothing to worry about.
You still have around 70% of your brain left.

266
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:23,215
No, no, this is more like a
philosophy overdose.

267
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,717
Basically, Michael just smoked a big bowl
of ennui

268
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,969
and now he's having an existential crisis.

269
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:30,013
So, we need to cheer him up.

270
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,101
Look at how pretty the restaurant is!

271
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,104
Didn't Tahani do a good job?

272
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:41,066
Parties are mere distractions
from the relentlessness of entropy.

273
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:42,526
We're all just corpses

274
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,903
who haven't yet begun to decay.

275
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:46,571
Yeah, but...

276
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:48,657
balloons!

277
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,744
OK, we all head over to Vicky's party
together.

278
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:56,456
We babysit Michael in shifts so that
no one sees he's a catatonic blob.

279
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,083
Or, you could just sit tight

280
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,128
the entire party are going to be
heading over here soon

281
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:02,963
unless I am sorely mistaken.

282
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,011
♪ I'm taking you, baby ♪

283
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:12,389
♪ All the way to Lucky Town... ♪

284
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,307
I was sorely mistaken.

285
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,060
OK, bud, whatever's going on right now

286
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,187
just shove your feelings way down deep

287
00:12:19,229 --> 00:12:22,733
plaster on a fake smile and pretend
you're having fun, OK?

288
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:25,402
Just like I used to do when someone
started talking about their kids.

289
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:28,613
Hey! Welcome, guys.

290
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:32,033
Wow, this is... elaborate.

291
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:34,494
Gunnar was an animal rights activist

292
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:37,205
so the theme of the party is "Animals!"

293
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,250
Flying station's over there,
if you want to fly like a falcon.

294
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,793
Wahoo!

295
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:44,796
And over there, we filled a ball pit
with puppies, that's fun.

296
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,383
Oh, and have you ever wanted to sit
in a kangaroo pouch?

297
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,760
My whole dang life.

298
00:12:50,218 --> 00:12:52,429
So, we can all hang out here for a bit
and then we can head over

299
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,847
to your party. Sound good?

300
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,515
Yo, this place is lit!

301
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,309
I'ma go jump in that kangie's pouch!

302
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,685
Hey!

303
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,314
Alright, Tahani, you just need to walk around
the party looking miserable.

304
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,149
Great, just like that. Perfect.

305
00:13:04,357 --> 00:13:06,610
And then, uh, Chidi and I will keep an eye
on Michael.

306
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:08,862
Where's Michael?

307
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:13,784
Ah... think I found him.

308
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:15,160
There they are!

309
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:16,787
Que pasa, muchachos?

310
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:19,247
Hey, there bud. You OK?

311
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:21,333
OK? I'm a new man!

312
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:23,835
Oh, Eleanor, thank you so much for the advice

313
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,171
about shoving my feelings down deep.

314
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,759
I feel so much better. It's like I'm surfin'
on this wave of positivity!

315
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:32,219
Is that Janet?

316
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:35,305
Oh, yeah, have you met my secretary,
Jeanette?

317
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:39,309
She's a lot like Janet but she doesn't
pretend like she has all the answers.

318
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,977
Oh, uh, hi, Jeanette!

319
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:43,146
Oh, no. It's still me - Janet.

320
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:45,524
Michael just asked that I change
my appearance

321
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,401
and also say things like, "You're so funny!"

322
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:51,530
And, "So, we should go to San Diego
this weekend."

323
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,825
And, "So, how many quarterbacks
are in a home run?"

324
00:13:55,492 --> 00:13:57,202
I don't understand what's happening.

325
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,830
Man, repressing your feelings is great.

326
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:04,292
I was feeling stress all the time
and now it's just so easy.

327
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:07,546
Babe, we need to get some food into you,
get you something to eat.

328
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:09,005
I don't eat anything.

329
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:10,340
She's perfect.

330
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,008
Hey, turn that around!

331
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,385
♪ Roll them dice, baby! ♪

332
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:17,347
It did kinda hurt actually, but I love it.

333
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:21,726
So, he's moved on from existential crisis
to just straight-up mid-life crisis.

334
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:22,811
That's good, right?

335
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:24,938
I knew a ton of guys like that
back in Arizona.

336
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,858
I mean, they hit on you when they're drunk
and their breath smells like supplements

337
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,150
but overall, they're pretty harmless.

338
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,111
It's Chinese for "Japan."

339
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:32,821
Ugh... So cool.

340
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,781
No, no. This is worse.

341
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:38,201
I mean, an existential crisis is an
acknowledgement that life is absurd

342
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,036
and that absurdity needs to be confronted.

343
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:43,164
But this is just denial. And at any moment
that denial could collapse

344
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:44,249
and he'll be a mess!

345
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,084
He is a Jenga tower of sadness!

346
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,837
For an immortal being, he's pretty fragile.

347
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,549
I mean, the guy contemplates his own death
for one forking minute

348
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,176
and completely loses his grip on reality?

349
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:03,685
You didn't have to come. I said I'm fine.

350
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,813
Yeah, well, I know you guys
weren't super close, but still.

351
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:09,107
It's hard, losing a parent.

352
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,401
Eleanor! Mummy's here, baby.

353
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:14,696
Oh, and who is this tall drink of wine?

354
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:17,407
Um, this is my boyfriend, Sam.

355
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,408
Sam, this is my...

356
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,409
mother
- Sister!

357
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,994
Sister.
Ugh, that's not gonna work...

358
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:22,537
It's my ex-husband's funeral.

359
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:24,748
Thanks for blowing my cover, Doug!

360
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:27,584
Listen, baby, don't be sad, OK?

361
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,461
Your father wasn't great.

362
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:31,296
Let's call him what he was

363
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,715
a fart in the shape of a man.

364
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,883
Can you just chill?

365
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,885
I don't want to turn Dad's funeral
into a roast.

366
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,304
I'm not! I'm just saying, he sucked.

367
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,140
I mean, the only photo they could get
of him was a mugshot.

368
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:45,685
He was a doof, so don't be sad
that he's gone.

369
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:47,228
I'm not sad. I'm fine.

370
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,146
Good.

371
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,399
You know, I had a long-running bet with
Eleanor's father that I would outlive him.

372
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,234
You wanna guess who won that one?
Come on, guess!

373
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:54,527
Well, we're at his funeral.
It's pretty clear...

374
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,154
I did! I won, he's dead!

375
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:57,072
Up top!

376
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:00,158
Whoa.

377
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,660
Is there a bar?

378
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:02,577
I'm just gonna...

379
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:06,998
Did my mum slip you her hotel room key?

380
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,917
Yes, yes, she did.

381
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,005
Thanks so much for coming to
Gunnar's birthday party!

382
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:18,635
Now, there was a little bit of a mix-up
and Tahani also planned a birthday party

383
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,097
over at the restaurant, so why don't we all
head over there?

384
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:23,139
Uh, no need.

385
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,141
This party is far superior.

386
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:26,810
I'm sure yours is amazing.

387
00:16:26,851 --> 00:16:29,229
Well, I did fine on the décor,
but I don't have...

388
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:32,816
you know...
actual unicorns you can ride.

389
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:37,070
So, you all just stay here and have fun.

390
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:39,280
OK, well, if... if that's what you want.

391
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,533
Let's all get back to the party then!

392
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:43,076
Hang on there, mis amigos!

393
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,369
- No, no, no, no...
- Wooo!

394
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:45,745
- I wanna make a toast!
- Michael... oh, boy.

395
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:49,207
OK, I know what you're thinking,
birth is a curse

396
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,459
and existence is a prison

397
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,128
but don't think about that!

398
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,213
Don't be sad, you guys.

399
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:58,258
Focus on something great, like Drakkar Noir

400
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,217
Woo!

401
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:03,096
Which I'm wearing a lot of tonight!
Or the Sharper Image catalogue

402
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,640
what can't those guys ionise?

403
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,643
By the way, I am feeling amazing!

404
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:10,186
I'm gonna do some push-ups.

405
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:13,189
Then we'll go around the room
and name our favourite cheese!

406
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,984
OK, that's good with the speeches.
That's good, yeah...

407
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:17,777
Let's all get back to the party.

408
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,029
What was that?

409
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,656
You didn't run any of that by me.
- Oh, I know, I know

410
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:23,116
I'm sorry, babe. Listen...

411
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,702
when you guys first took over, I was upset.

412
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:27,579
But it's all good, now.

413
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,414
I mean, anger is toxic

414
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,332
I'm not about that negativity.

415
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,960
Mi torture es su torture.

416
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:36,129
I am so happy you're in charge.

417
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,547
OK. Well...

418
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:38,757
good!

419
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:40,717
Namaste, chica.

420
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:43,553
Do you wanna dance?
- No.

421
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,471
OK.

422
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:47,265
I'm leaving.

423
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:49,684
I'm too miserable to stay here
for one more second.

424
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:52,562
Why? There are baby monkeys
and dolphins to ride

425
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,314
and a game of "Hungry, Hungry, Hippos"

426
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:55,815
with actual hippos.

427
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:58,485
This party is way better than ours.

428
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:02,322
Why are you miserabl... oh.

429
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:03,656
You stay and have fun.

430
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:05,950
I'm going to go throw myself a pity party

431
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,828
though I doubt I can even
throw one of those properly.

432
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,126
God, I love this stuff.

433
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:17,087
Ah!

434
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:18,463
Let's keep this party going!

435
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:20,465
What now, huh? You wanna hit the clubs?

436
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,133
Oh, oh, oh, Vegas.

437
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:25,136
No, no, even better, Dubai.

438
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:27,597
Jeanette, make us a Dubai.

439
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,266
Kinda feel like maybe

440
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,310
we should wind down, huh, bud?

441
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:34,646
No, no, can't do that... can't stop moving,
can't stop moving.

442
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:36,773
If I stop moving, I'll start thinking.
And if I start thinking

443
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,901
I'll start thinking about things
I don't want to think about, like death.

444
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:42,028
Whoops...

445
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:43,738
I'm thinking about it now.

446
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,657
Yep. Thinking about death again.

447
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,783
Oh! I know!

448
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,160
Jeanette and I have been taking, uh,
samba lessons, huh?

449
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,912
Let us show you how to do it. Come on.

450
00:18:50,954 --> 00:18:53,957
I think Vicky bought his excuse but we need
to snap him out of this.

451
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:57,293
Which one of these confusing French books
will make him normal again?

452
00:18:57,502 --> 00:18:58,753
It's not that easy.

453
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:01,798
I mean, emotionally, he's all over the map
right now.

454
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
And I can't believe I'm saying this but
I don't think this can be solved with a book.

455
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:08,596
What's the big whoop? I dealt
with death and I was fine.

456
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:11,391
Were you? I mean... you never had
one moment where you were freaked out

457
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:13,768
by the permanence of death?

458
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:15,478
Never one moment like that?

459
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,398
Hey, man, you got toothbrush holders?

460
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:19,899
Uh, sure. Yeah.

461
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:21,568
Right over here.
- What's this?

462
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:23,194
Who has four toothbrushes?

463
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:25,113
Like, Bill Gates or something?

464
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,823
No, that's, like, for a family.

465
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:30,118
Family?

466
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:33,496
Like a whole family and
their toothbrushes all together?

467
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,040
Two slots for the parent toothbrushes

468
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:39,043
and two slots for their... kids?

469
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:40,879
Yep.

470
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:45,133
So, the parent toothbrushes can be close
to the kid toothbrushes and...

471
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:47,927
watch over them, and...

472
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,391
they can all talk about
their toothbrush feelings

473
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,853
and they can hold
their little toothbrush hands

474
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,937
when they're sad.

475
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,314
And...

476
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:02,066
make sure no harm ever comes
to their little bristles?

477
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,945
Sure.

478
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:13,828
Uh, you need a Kleenex?

479
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:14,787
Thank you.

480
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,539
Sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

481
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:18,917
A family pack?

482
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:32,931
I don't know if what I'm gonna say
is gonna hurt or help, but screw it.

483
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:34,682
Do you know what's really
happening right now?

484
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:37,602
You're learning what it's like to be human.

485
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:42,565
All humans are aware of death,
so we're all a little bit sad

486
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,275
all the time.

487
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:45,777
That's just the deal.

488
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:49,113
Sounds like a crappy deal.

489
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,200
Well, yeah, it is.

490
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:54,661
But we don't get offered any other ones.

491
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:59,290
And if you try and ignore your sadness,
it just ends up leaking out of you anyway.

492
00:20:59,832 --> 00:21:00,750
I've been there.

493
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,377
And everybody's been there.

494
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:03,419
So, don't fight it.

495
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,340
And in the words of a very wise
"Bed, Bath and Beyond" employee

496
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:08,508
I once knew...

497
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,635
"Go ahead and cry all you want."

498
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,097
"But you're gonna have to pay
for that toilet plunger."

499
00:21:19,102 --> 00:21:20,311
Got you something to eat.

500
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:21,729
I'm not hungry.

501
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,441
I just want to sit and stare at nothing

502
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:28,152
and silently scream for the rest of time.

503
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,281
I might be way off base here

504
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,658
but you seem kinda bummed.

505
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:36,035
I really thought I could throw a better party

506
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,955
than a magical, all-powerful being.

507
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:42,834
And moreover, what's this say about me?
About the life I lived?

508
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:46,546
The way they're torturing me is through
event-planning mishaps.

509
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:48,006
And it works!

510
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:50,425
Am I really that shallow?

511
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:52,510
Listen.

512
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:57,223
Back in Jacksonville, I was in charge
of a 60-person dance crew.

513
00:21:57,265 --> 00:21:59,392
Whenever we
auditioned a new dancer

514
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:02,020
we would rate them in five categories

515
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:03,396
dancing ability

516
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:04,522
coolness

517
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:05,606
dopeness

518
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:06,774
freshness

519
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,276
and smart-brained.

520
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:11,487
I would give you an eight in every category.

521
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:13,239
Well, eight isn't bad, I suppose.

522
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:14,949
Oh, no. Eight is the best.

523
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:16,951
It was a scale of one to 13

524
00:22:16,993 --> 00:22:18,870
but eight was highest.

525
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:20,663
The scale went up and then back down

526
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:21,581
like a tent.

527
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:22,707
Why?

528
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,042
It's not important.

529
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,377
Lately, you've been really down on yourself

530
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:29,213
but you're the most
amazing person I've ever met

531
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,132
uh, besides Michael.

532
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:32,967
And he was constantly torturing us

533
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:34,260
so I'd only rank him a ten.

534
00:22:34,427 --> 00:22:35,762
Which is worse than an eight?

535
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:38,806
That's so unnecessarily confusing.

536
00:22:39,182 --> 00:22:40,141
The point is

537
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,687
you're cool, dope, fresh, and smart-brained.

538
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:48,316
Never seen you dance, but I bet you're good

539
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:50,568
because you're good at everything.

540
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:52,570
You're awesome.

541
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:55,073
Be nicer to yourself!

542
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:56,908
Thank you, Jason.

543
00:22:59,243 --> 00:23:01,788
From one eight to another.

544
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,126
"Excellent progress this week."

545
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:09,545
"Tahani, devastated by party mishap."

546
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,966
"Eleanor continues to be a selfish monster,
creating burden for Chidi."

547
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:15,551
"Selfish monster?"

548
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:18,846
I brought you back from the brink
of an existential coma, dude!

549
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:21,140
Selfish monster...
- No, no, I have to embellish your misery

550
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:24,936
on these fake torture reports so that
my boss doesn't get suspicious.

551
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:29,107
But really, I am grateful
you pulled me out of my funk.

552
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:32,902
I mean, is that how you all felt on Earth?

553
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,529
Because that was just awful.

554
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,822
Oh, yeah, it was no fun.

555
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:39,325
But you had it worse,
because you're an immortal being.

556
00:23:39,492 --> 00:23:42,245
Humans learn that they're going to die
when they're six.

557
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:44,205
- Mm.
- How old are you?

558
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:45,790
Hard to explain, really.

559
00:23:45,915 --> 00:23:49,210
On my birth certificate it just says,
"always".

560
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:50,837
Hm. Well...

561
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,632
now that you've become acquainted with
Existential Crises

562
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:58,845
I thought we could read "Death,"
by philosopher Todd May.

563
00:23:58,928 --> 00:24:00,638
Sounds like the perfect beach read.

564
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,682
Should we wait for Tahani and Jason?

565
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,267
Where are those goofballs?

566
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,897
So, um, we should probably discuss...

567
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:12,733
That was awesome!

568
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,193
It was...

569
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,195
surprisingly so.

570
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,364
But we should still discuss—

571
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,450
You want some breakfast?
I know how to make cereal.

572
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:21,951
Sure, but Jason—

573
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,035
OK, be right back!
