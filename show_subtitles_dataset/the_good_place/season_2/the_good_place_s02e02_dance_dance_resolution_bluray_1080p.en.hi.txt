1
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:05,289
This is daily notes log
for attempt number three

2
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:06,916
of my Neighbourhood experiment.

3
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:13,047
Obviously, I hope and assume
this will be the final version.

4
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:15,758
No, I know it will be.

5
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:18,886
All the kinks have been worked out.
This is the one.

6
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:24,141
And after I pull this off,
they're gonna hang my picture

7
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:27,186
in the Bad Place Hall of Fame
right next to the guy

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,271
who invented bees with teeth.

9
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:34,735
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

10
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:35,987
Cool.

11
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:37,196
I'm Chris Baker.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,032
I'm your soulmate.
- Bring it in, man.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,245
Sorry, I must ask,
why are you wearing a sash

14
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:46,288
that says "best person" on it?

15
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,624
Apparently, I am the number one points-getter

16
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,042
in the entire Neighbourhood.

17
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:51,502
Is that so?

18
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:54,046
I always have to have my sashes
custom-made

19
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,340
due to my height and bosom size.

20
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:59,093
Also, apparently,
sashes are out this season.

21
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:02,763
The diagonal line really draws one's eye
to the chin bloat.

22
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:06,684
Go fork yourself, you mean giraffe.

23
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:12,356
Run! Giraffes! Giraffes! Run!

24
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:17,570
Oh! Mean giraffes are destroying
the Neighbourhood.

25
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,196
Gah!
- Oh, boy.

26
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:23,659
Hey, robot slave lady?

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,286
Busty Alexa?

28
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,787
Oh, Janet?

29
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:28,080
- Hi, there.
- Gah!

30
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:29,498
Still not used to it.

31
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,086
Uh, hey, what if I,
an already amazing person

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,256
who definitely belongs here,
wanted to learn even more

33
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:38,591
about how to be a good person?

34
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:42,053
Is one of these nerds, like, a teacher
or a life coach

35
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,804
or an Instagram fitness model
or something?

36
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:48,309
Eleanor, I'd like you to meet
Chidi Anagonye.

37
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:50,269
Chidi, this is Eleanor.

38
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:52,938
Janet tells me you were
a professor of some kind.

39
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:56,317
Yes, I was a professor of ethics
and moral philosophy

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,777
focusing on deontology.

41
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:59,570
Hang on one second, Chibi.

42
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:02,364
This guy's too big of a nerd.

43
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:03,282
Who else you got?

44
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,160
Michael, what do we do here?
- I don't know.

45
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,746
Apparently, the Bad Place knows
that one of you

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,916
actually belongs down there with them,
and they want that person

47
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:14,627
to get inside the obelisk,
or they're gonna take all of you.

48
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:16,754
I can't go. I'm too young to die

49
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:18,964
and too old to eat off the kids' menu.

50
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:20,841
What a stupid age I am.

51
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,301
I'd never survive down there.

52
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:23,969
They should take Eleanor.
She's a pear shape.

53
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:25,679
She'd fit right in.
- Oh, excuse me.

54
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:27,348
You wish you could have a bite
of this pear.

55
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:29,266
I'll go. I deserve to go.
You guys can stay.

56
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:36,190
Holy forking shirt.

57
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,943
You guys, don't you get it?

58
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,861
Michael is torturing us.

59
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,531
That's why our lives have been
so miserable

60
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:44,907
since the moment we got here.

61
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,577
This isn't the Good Place.
It's the Bad Place.

62
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,541
Ah, farts.

63
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,092
OK, attempt number 11.

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,760
Let's focus on the positives.

65
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:06,554
Eleanor always hates her house.

66
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:08,681
Tahani always hates Eleanor.

67
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,016
Jason hates being quiet.

68
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:13,727
Chidi immediately gets a stomach ache.

69
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:15,771
So there's a lot to work with here.

70
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:18,858
Hang on one second, Cheeto.

71
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,987
So it's gonna be a hard pass on
Superdork Jones over there.

72
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,655
Anybody else you got to teach me?

73
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:26,157
You guys ready for our lesson?

74
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:30,369
We're talking David Hume today,
bundle theory of the self, baby.

75
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:33,372
Sounds like a real banger,
but you guys gotta scram.

76
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:36,333
My soulmate has some sort of surprise
planned for me

77
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,002
and he seems very excited about it.

78
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:40,629
Well, you two are certainly getting
along very well these days.

79
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:43,924
Yeah, I'm actually kind of
into Sebastian lately.

80
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,136
I mean, he's a little hokey,
but he's growing on me a little bit.

81
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:51,473
My love, my sweet dewdrop

82
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:57,980
I have written you a three-hour
spoken-word jazz opera.

83
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,235
Cool!

- What?

88
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:18,417
No version of heaven for anyone
would ever include three hours of...

89
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:19,710
this.

90
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,462
We're in the Bad Place, aren't we?

91
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,214
Damn it.

92
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:27,051
That was a real trip for biscuits,
and now we're all wet, Daddy-O.

93
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,345
I never even got to play
my stupid triangle.

94
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:33,098
No, no, no, no
Michael, please, please, please!

95
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:35,517
Please don't kill me.
I have so much to live for.

96
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,520
I'm sorry, Janet, got to reboot you
every time I start over.

97
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,023
Oh, I know.
I'm not actually upset.

98
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,401
It's just the automatic fail-safe mechanism
that kicks in every time

99
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,362
you approach the plunger.
Go ahead.

100
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:48,530
Ah.
- Michael, you monster!

101
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:53,827
Attempt 32.

102
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:56,455
Attempt 57.

103
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:58,540
Attempt 99.

104
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,334
Attempt 108.

105
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:02,544
I've analysed some recent data.

106
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,881
Eleanor always seems to realise
that they're in the Bad Place

107
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:07,758
- just at the moment that—
- Excuse me.

108
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,177
Sorry, the door was open,
so I just came in.

109
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,263
Did you just say I'm in the Bad Place?

110
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:15,849
Attempt 109.

111
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,060
I've closed and locked the door.

112
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:21,230
Yep, and we're ready to go.

113
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:24,066
This is your soulmate, Greg.

114
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,985
This is your soulmate, Glenn.

115
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,987
This is your soulmate, Tahani.

116
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,697
This is your soulmate, Lerf.

117
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:32,700
This is your soulmate,
a golden retriever.

118
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,535
Hang on.

119
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:35,452
Wait a minute.

120
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:36,453
You know what?

121
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,997
Holy smokes.

122
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,582
This is the Bad Place.

123
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,459
This is the Bad Place!

124
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:44,295
This is the Bad Place.

125
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,006
This is the Bad Place.
- The pig's getting angry.

126
00:05:47,256 --> 00:05:50,843
This is the Bad Place!
- Bees, bees, bees, bees!

127
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:54,179
Oh! Oh, this is the Bad Place.
- Shh!

128
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:57,433
Michael, Michael, if I'm gone,
who will take care of my birds?

129
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:01,103
Michael, no, no, no, no, no!
I... I'm pregnant.

130
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:02,313
And it's your baby.

131
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,775
I have tickets to "Hamilton" next week,
and there's a rumour

132
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,694
that Daveed Diggs is coming back.

133
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:11,989
Janet, we've been through this
hundreds of times.

134
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,782
I mean, can you just chill out?

135
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:15,492
Is that possible, Janet?

136
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:16,910
Can you just chill out a little?

137
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,580
Nope, it's gonna be the same every time.

138
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:22,374
Yeah, yeah, I know.

139
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,667
No, no, no! No, Michael!

140
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:28,380
Please, please, calm down.

141
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,382
Calm down. Alright...

142
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:32,426
OK, calm down. Calm down.

143
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,888
I mean, why even bother at this point?

144
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:38,557
I'm obviously never gonna get it right.

145
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:40,893
"I'm Eleanor. I'm so smart."

146
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:43,854
"I'm actually in the Bad Place."
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

147
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:46,774
Shawn still thinks I'm on version two.

148
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,693
I just keep lying to him,
and it's really bad, but I...

149
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,364
I mean, I have to keep trying.
I'm in too deep.

150
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,491
And I'm really fat right now.

151
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,786
I'm stress-eating,
and I'm gaining weight in my thighs.

152
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,621
I mean, look at that...

153
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,457
Ugh.

154
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,919
So sorry. Who are you?

155
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:10,464
And where am I?
- It doesn't matter.

156
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,758
This one doesn't even count.

157
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:22,768
Hang on one second, Chili.

158
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:26,313
This guy sucks.
Who else you got?

159
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,356
I can hear you.

160
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:31,860
Michael, you simply cannot expect Chidi
to decide whether Eleanor goes to the...

161
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,947
Yo, yo, homies, check it.

162
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,366
There's something messed up
with this place.

163
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,118
We keep fighting with each other.

164
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:42,037
None of the TVs
get the NFL RedZone channel.

165
00:07:42,955 --> 00:07:44,998
My soulmate doesn't even know
who Blake Bortles is.

166
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,708
I know this sounds crazy

167
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:50,212
but I think we're in the Bad Place.

168
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:52,798
Jason figured it out?

169
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:56,009
Jason?
This is a real low point.

170
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:57,469
Yeah, this one hurts.

171
00:07:58,637 --> 00:07:59,638
Ow.

172
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,224
OK, this might be the one.

173
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,310
We're a week in.
Chidi's teaching Eleanor, but she hates it.

174
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:08,647
Tahani still thinks that Jason's a monk.

175
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:10,691
Everyone's miserable.

176
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,401
I'm so happy.

177
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,153
Fingers crossed.

178
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:21,285
Vicky, where is everyone?

179
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,328
They're not coming, Michael.

180
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:25,914
You have lost control of this experiment

181
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,334
so we are on strike
until our demands are met.

182
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:33,464
I speak for the entire crew, Michael.

183
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:34,673
We're sick of it.

184
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:37,968
We can barely remember what we're supposed
to be doing anymore, plus...

185
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:42,097
I spent weeks
perfecting this excellent Australian accent

186
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,308
I did. And then I never got a chance
to use it.

187
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,727
You're still upset about the size
of your part?

188
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,062
Yes, I want a more important role.

189
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,731
But that's just my demand.

190
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:54,318
All 318 of us have something
we want to do differently.

191
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,487
Some people want bigger houses.

192
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,908
Gayle wants a different backstory
where she was an MMA fighter?

193
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:05,871
Gunnar wants to bite and/or nibble
on humans while they sleep.

194
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,331
You do know, Vicky

195
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:10,709
that if I were to do some of these
that it would be a dead giveaway?

196
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,794
And I can help you explain that to them.

197
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:14,713
But some of these are doable.

198
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,673
And you're gonna do 'em.

199
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:23,055
So Aristotle believes your character
is voluntary, because, uh...

200
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:24,765
are you ignoring me right now?

201
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:28,852
It's day two of our ethics lessons,
and you're already tuning out?

202
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,104
No, sorry, I just got distracted
for a second.

203
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:33,607
The last thing I remember you saying is...

204
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:34,816
nothing.

205
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,527
Can you start from the beginning?

206
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,570
OK, I need a little break.

207
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:41,907
Can we take a walk or something,
maybe get some clam chowder?

208
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:50,582
Where is everyone?
- Who knows?

209
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,752
Maybe they finally figured out
clam chowder is disgusting

210
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:56,797
cos it's basically a savoury latte
with bugs in it.

211
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:02,052
Is someone smoking a cigar?

212
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,389
Michael really screwed this up.

213
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,349
The regular Bad Place was fine.

214
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:10,686
If the four-headed flying bears
ain't broke, don't fix 'em.

215
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,604
What was wrong with impaling?
I loved impaling.

216
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:14,898
Hey, Todd, got a light?

217
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:17,901
Uh, yeah, obviously I have a light.

218
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,861
You know, you guys aren't
supposed to be smoking.

219
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:21,822
You're supposed to keep
your human suit on.

220
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,657
Those suits are really itchy for us.

221
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,200
Who even cares if they see us?

222
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,244
They're just gonna get rebooted anyway.

223
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:30,163
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

224
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,748
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

225
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:34,209
This is the Bad Place! I forking knew it!

226
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,461
And clam chowder is disgusting.

227
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:39,840
It's just hot ocean milk
with dead animal croutons.

228
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,341
OK, but what do we do, panic, freak?

229
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,510
I usually panic, but I am happy to freak.

230
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,846
We have to stay cool.
As my mum always used to say

231
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:48,682
if a cop handcuffs you to a bike rack

232
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,976
there's always something
you can gnaw through.

233
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:53,061
Your mum always said that?

234
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:54,563
Come on, brain.

235
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:56,732
- Janet!
- Hi, there.

236
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:58,567
How can I help you?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

237
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,988
How do we know she's not a part of it?
- We don't, but we gotta risk it.

238
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:06,116
Janet, can we, like, leave
the Neighbourhood

239
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,453
get as far away as possible?
Is there anywhere we can go?

240
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,876
So, we're in the Bad Place, and I know why.
Almond milk.

241
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,003
I knew it was bad for the environment

242
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:20,547
but I loved the way
it coated my tongue with a weird film.

243
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:22,966
Who else is being tortured?
Are we the only two?

244
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:25,927
I got to assume Jason is as well, Jianyu.

245
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,388
You know him as Jianyu,
but his real name is Jason

246
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:29,681
and he's a dirt bag from Florida.

247
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:32,392
What?
- Also, Tahani is a candidate

248
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,518
as far as I'm concerned.

249
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:36,396
Yesterday, she told me
that she was Taylor Swift's best friend

250
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,482
but Taylor Swift wasn't her best friend.

251
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:40,067
She sucks.

252
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:43,570
No offense, but I can't believe
you and I ended up in the same place.

253
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:45,405
Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either, bud.

254
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,325
I always assumed the afterlife was
full of cool people

255
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,743
not talking sweater vests.

256
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,286
- You...
- We're here.

257
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:54,706
Aren't trains neat? Choo-choo!

258
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:03,840
Hi. You gotta help us.

259
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:05,342
I'm Eleanor. This is Chidi.

260
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,219
And see, we thought we were
in the Good Place

261
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:08,845
but as it turns out...
- Yeah, guys.

262
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:11,848
I know. You've been here 15 times already.

263
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:12,891
What?

264
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:14,893
Did you bring the cocaine I asked for?

265
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:17,396
Please tell me you somehow
remembered this time.

266
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,564
Mama needs her medicine.

267
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:20,774
We've met before?

268
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,694
I'm Janet.
- I know.

269
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:26,697
Vicky, let's look at the big picture here.

270
00:12:26,822 --> 00:12:29,700
Now, if you all can just stick with my plan

271
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,494
and we pull it off, we'll be heroes.

272
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:34,413
You could write your own ticket.

273
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,749
You might even land
the "Jared from Subway" account.

274
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,044
Yeah, but I don't think you can pull it off.

275
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,964
You can't even pull off those bow ties.

276
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,301
That was very mean,
but I'm gonna move past that

277
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,886
in the name of unit cohesion.

278
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:52,889
You're gonna reboot
those four dum-dums one more time

279
00:12:53,014 --> 00:12:54,599
and then I'm taking over.

280
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,394
I'm going to execute my version
of this Neighbourhood.

281
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:01,189
You see, I've been working on it
while all of your versions fell apart.

282
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,692
This is insubordination.

283
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:06,445
And if you do not do
what I tell you immediately

284
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,989
you are going down.

285
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:15,871
That's a complete report of every mistake
you've made, every screw-up

286
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:20,250
every reboot all laid out
in excruciating detail.

287
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,837
Now, I'm sure your boss would love
to hear all about how

288
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:25,922
"attempt number 2" is really going.

289
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:30,927
So actually, if you don't do what I say

290
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:32,637
you're going down.

291
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:34,639
Down under.

292
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:39,394
Is it always the three of us?

293
00:13:39,478 --> 00:13:41,188
It's always at least Eleanor and Janet.

294
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:42,981
Usually Chidi's in the mix.

295
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:45,025
Sometimes Jason is here.

296
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,444
One time, Jason and Tahani were here.

297
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:49,613
But you know what?
No matter what the combo is

298
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,866
I always ask you guys to bring me
cocaine next time, and you never do.

299
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:54,826
Do you have anything I can snort?

300
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:57,329
Like a crushed-up aspirin
or some eye-shadow or...

301
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,748
cocaine?
- Still no.

302
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,709
There's only one question
we need to answer right now

303
00:14:02,793 --> 00:14:04,336
and that is, what do we do next?

304
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,214
I mean, this place doesn't seem terrible.

305
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:09,508
Maybe we should just stay here forever.
- "Maybe we should just stay here forever."

306
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:12,594
You always say that.
And you always end up going back.

307
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,971
I mean, sometimes you go back
because you feel bad

308
00:14:15,096 --> 00:14:16,306
your friends don't know what you know.

309
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,517
Sometimes you go back
because you walk in on me

310
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:20,769
while I'm masturbating
and sometimes you go back

311
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:23,271
because I walk in on you
while I'm masturbating.

312
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:26,191
But no matter what, you always go back.

313
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:29,569
You formulate a plan to defeat Michael,
and you head back.

314
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,071
OK, a plan.

315
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:32,948
We need a plan, but...

316
00:14:33,323 --> 00:14:34,658
What if we come up with a plan
- "What if we come up with a plan"

317
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,117
we've already tried before?
- "we've already tried before?"

318
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,494
Will you please stop that?
- "Will you please stop that?"

319
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:42,874
Yeah, just to help you out a little,
I've written down every plan

320
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,211
you've ever come up with,
which obviously never worked

321
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:49,214
because you're here,
and you're back, so good luck.

322
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,175
"Physically attack Michael.
Seduce Michael."

323
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:54,469
"Make Michael think he's the one
in the Bad Place."

324
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:57,764
"Catch that magic panda.
Use her powers."

325
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:00,100
Oh, I'm guessing that was Jason.

326
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,394
That guy has no idea what's going on.

327
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,067
Hello? Hello.
Where is everyone?

328
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:12,070
Janet?
- Hey, there, Jason.

329
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:13,697
Oh, hey, homie.

330
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:17,951
Uh, I mean... Jason?

331
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,829
Who is Jason? I am a monk.

332
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:21,872
You know what?

333
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:25,417
Can I talk to you for a second?

334
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,003
I'm in a tight spot,
and I could use someone

335
00:15:28,086 --> 00:15:30,338
to bounce some ideas off of, OK?

336
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,718
Oh, yeah, real quick,
you're really in the Bad Place

337
00:15:34,843 --> 00:15:35,886
and you're being tortured.

338
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:39,931
What?
- I know it says here that we already tried

339
00:15:40,056 --> 00:15:43,685
throwing Tahani under the bus,
but maybe we should revisit that.

340
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:46,688
Throw her a little bit harder.
Maybe under a bigger bus.

341
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:50,734
What do you think?
- I think this is pointless.

342
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:54,487
We're trapped in a warped version
of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.

343
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:57,157
Oh, cool, more philosophy.
That'll help us!

344
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,074
Well, don't you see the problem?

345
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,161
We are experiencing karma,
but we can't learn from our mistakes

346
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:02,996
because our memories keep getting erased.

347
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:04,831
It's an epistemological nightmare.

348
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:07,375
Ugh, even your nightmares are boring.

349
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,794
You... you are so mean, Eleanor.

350
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:12,923
You're just like those childhood bullies
who said I would never get tenure.

351
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:14,883
And you are so irritating!

352
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:17,385
In one of these reboots,
I probably strangled you

353
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:22,057
and then went to the Even Worse Place,
but you know what? I bet it was worth it.

354
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:23,391
Oh, nice.

355
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:28,980
Ugh! Sorry, can I just vent to you
for a second? Chidi is so annoying.

356
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,609
I just... I cannot believe that he is the one
I'm stuck here with.

357
00:16:32,734 --> 00:16:34,486
Uh-huh, wow, crazy.

358
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:38,490
Oh, sorry, Jeez, man, I thought you could
be human for, like, two seconds

359
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:41,159
and listen to me.
- I have, Eleanor.

360
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:45,664
I have listened to you talk about Chidi
15 times in 15 different ways.

361
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:47,165
Let me just cut to the chase.

362
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,751
You two, you got it bad for each other.

363
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:53,254
No, we don't. Chidi's just a friend.

364
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:54,589
What am I saying? He's not even a friend.

365
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:57,050
He's just a weird teacher that I hate.

366
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,931
Dude, I do not want to watch
"Cannonball Run 2" right now.

367
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:06,518
Alright, what happened in the first one,
so I'm all caught up?

368
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:12,273
I don't know what's gonna happen to us,
but I need to tell you something.

369
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:15,568
I love you.

370
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:20,448
And you don't need to respond
cos I know you have trouble saying

371
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:21,825
how you feel.
- I love you too.

372
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:23,326
Very funny

373
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,537
but that... that's obviously not real.

374
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:27,831
Oh, that's real, baby.

375
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,582
That's real nasty.

376
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:33,712
Yeah, this was, like, the sixth time
you guys were here.

377
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,131
I saw you getting sexy
the previous three times

378
00:17:36,214 --> 00:17:38,341
so I cut a little hole in the wall
so I could tape you.

379
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,218
Call it my lookin' hole.

380
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:44,014
- Is that a camera?
- Mindy, you pervert!

381
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:48,476
How many times have Chidi
and I slept together?

382
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,563
Eight different days, but, like,
20 different sessions.

383
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:55,316
And how many times did we say... that stuff?

384
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,736
Oh, only once. Oh, God, I hated it.

385
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,738
It, like, really killed the vibe for me.

386
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,532
See, after I watch the porno
I made starring you

387
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,076
I watch you talk about your feelings
to cool down.

388
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,703
It's, like, anti-porn.

389
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,791
I've only ever said "I love you"
to two men my entire life -

390
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,877
Stone Cold Steve Austin

391
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,087
and a guy in a dark club

392
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,882
who I mistook for Stone Cold Steve Austin.

393
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:21,926
I mean, why would you show me that?
- I don't know.

394
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:25,221
You guys are, like, trapped here together.
I feel bad.

395
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,182
You know, I'm rooting for you guys.

396
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,851
No, there is no "us guys."
We basically just met each other.

397
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:31,227
No, Eleanor.

398
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:34,022
You guys have known each other
a really long time.

399
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,442
Also, it doesn't matter if I told you
that or not

400
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,487
because when Michael finds out
he's failed again, he'll just reboot you.

401
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:45,200
Chidi, Janet, we're leaving.

402
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,579
I am taking this with me.

403
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:52,624
"Oh, no, it's my only copy." Don't...

404
00:18:57,629 --> 00:18:59,214
How did it come to this?

405
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,635
I was just trying to do something
innovative and different

406
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,011
that would improve the way

407
00:19:05,261 --> 00:19:08,098
we make humans' lives miserable
for eternity.

408
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:10,016
Mm, well...
- Shut up.

409
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,602
What are my options?
Do I have any?

410
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:17,440
I mean, I can't go along with her plan.
It'll be a spectacular failure.

411
00:19:17,565 --> 00:19:21,194
But I can't ignore her
or she'll rat me out to Shawn.

412
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:24,864
I'm trapped.
- You're saying a lot of words right now

413
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:29,410
and I only know some of them,
like "rat" and "Jason"

414
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:32,747
but I know a little wisdom I can give you.

415
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:35,458
I know everything that happened in your life

416
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:38,503
and it was all stupid,
so I highly doubt that.

417
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:41,881
I was a member of a 60-person dance crew
in Jacksonville.

418
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:46,594
We were called "Dance Dance Resolution:
We Resolve To Dance."

419
00:19:47,262 --> 00:19:49,848
One day, Donkey Doug and I got into a fight

420
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:52,767
because I'd framed his girlfriend
for boogie board theft

421
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:56,813
so he started a new dance crew
called "Hashtag DougLife"

422
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,941
and immediately challenged us
to a dance-off.

423
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,195
He said, "Meet us inside the abandoned
orange juice factory at midnight."

424
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:09,576
That night, as the clock struck 12:00,
me and my crew came together

425
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:13,705
with a determination we had
never shown before

426
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,749
and slashed all their tyres.

427
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,294
It was dope.

428
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,296
The end.

429
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:23,756
By Jason Mendoza.

430
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:28,761
You know, that inane story
actually contains a bit of good advice.

431
00:20:28,887 --> 00:20:31,431
Thank you, Jason.
- You got it, homie.

432
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:36,728
I give good advice!
Guess that's why I'm in the Good Place.

433
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:42,066
Oh, there you guys are.
- No.

434
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:43,818
Stop, no more lies.

435
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:45,653
Jason, get over here.

436
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:48,865
That's right. We know his name is Jason,
not Jianyu.

437
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,116
We know everything.

438
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:53,703
I don't understand much of it,
but, yeah, I know it.

439
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:57,415
Your sick torture plan is not working, OK?

440
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,417
Cos we keep figuring out your little puzzle.

441
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:02,212
We're winning, which means you're losing.

442
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:04,088
So you have two choices here, buddy.

443
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:07,842
Keep failing over and over
or realise we're actually

444
00:21:07,926 --> 00:21:09,260
the ones with all the power here.

445
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:11,012
Yeah, no, uh...

446
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:13,139
We're on the same page.
- What?

447
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,557
I want to team up with you guys.

448
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,976
What? Why? You do? What?

449
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,896
I'm in a bit of a bind,
and I could use some back-up

450
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,398
or as Jason put it, um...

451
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,775
I need a new dance crew.

452
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:26,152
So, what do you say?
New best friends?

453
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:28,947
Stop it...
