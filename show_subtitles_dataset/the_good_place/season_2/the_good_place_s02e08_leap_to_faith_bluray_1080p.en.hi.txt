00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,222
Hello, Michael.

2
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,307
Shut the door. Have a seat.

3
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:12,397
When you proposed this new form of torture,
we all laughed behind your back.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,858
Some people called you names,
like "The Thomas Edison of Incompetence"

5
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:17,694
or, "That Dick."

6
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:18,945
Mm-hm.

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,948
But against all odds,
it seems you've pulled it off.

8
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,783
What you've done here is truly amazing.

9
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:26,703
Really?
- Yes. These reports are remarkable.

10
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,955
Your humans are experiencing
emotional torture

11
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:30,707
at the same level of physical torture

12
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,001
created by our squiggliest
Eyeball Corkscrews.

13
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:34,919
I'm... jubilant.

14
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:39,382
As a result of our success,
I'm getting a seat on the High Council.

15
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:41,926
We will greatly expand our Neighbourhood idea

16
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:44,137
and you will oversee the entire project.

17
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:45,680
You are being promoted.

18
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:51,060
Your Senior Staff Pin. Congratulations.

19
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,187
This is everything you've ever wanted.

20
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,773
This is everything I've ever wanted.

21
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:56,733
Oh!

22
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,944
This is everything I've ever wanted!

23
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:02,030
Oh, wow!

24
00:01:02,113 --> 00:01:04,657
- You're really happy?
- Can't you tell?

25
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,951
I'm basically squealing like a birthday girl.

26
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,087
At some point, we should finish discussing
yesterday's events.

27
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,632
Do you mean us almost getting married

28
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:22,592
and then finding out I was married to Janet

29
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:25,094
and then Janet making a boyfriend
to forget me

30
00:01:25,136 --> 00:01:26,971
and then Janet getting rid of that boyfriend?

31
00:01:28,014 --> 00:01:30,516
Or do you mean when we saw that cool cloud?

32
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,352
The first bit.

33
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:35,897
Perhaps later, after Michael briefs us on how
we're going to be fake-tortured today

34
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:37,523
we can just sit down and have a chat?

35
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:40,693
Yes. Good idea.

36
00:01:41,444 --> 00:01:42,612
Yo, Chidi?
- Yeah?

37
00:01:42,695 --> 00:01:44,781
You wanna hear about a cool cloud I saw?

38
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:49,744
Come in.

39
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:57,001
I'd like to start by saying something
I've wanted to say for a very long time.

40
00:01:57,085 --> 00:02:01,297
Surprise, idiots!
You're all in the Bad Place!

41
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,219
That's right, nerds!

42
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:11,391
Everything around you, all you can see,
is an elaborate system of torture

43
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:13,685
designed just for you.

44
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,772
Sorry... we're in the Bad Place?

45
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:20,274
Why are you revealing this now?

46
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:24,153
Well, it was an experiment, and it worked,
so my boss is promoting me.

47
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:27,240
Sorry, I should've introduced you.
This is my boss, Shawn.

48
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:28,908
Hello, imbeciles.

49
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,244
We need to study everything
that happened here.

50
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:34,622
There was a first version that collapsed,
but the second has been a huge success.

51
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,040
We'll be shutting this place down.

52
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:38,209
The four of you
will be brought to the real Bad Place

53
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:42,171
where your brains will be removed, studied,
and batted about a stadium like beach balls.

54
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,299
Your arms will be peeled like bananas -
that part's just for fun.

55
00:02:45,383 --> 00:02:47,260
Right.
- And then you will be...

56
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,595
you know, tortured forever.

57
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:54,600
Michael, is this all true?
- Yes, Eleanor, it is.

58
00:02:54,684 --> 00:02:58,479
You're such a rube, thinking you could
become a better person.

59
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:02,316
You got Chidi
to teach you stupid philosophy

60
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:06,028
like those old farts
were going to provide guidance.

61
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:10,825
"Oh, Kierkegaard is so great,
have you read 'Fear and Trembling'?"

62
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:13,995
"Well, I don't know,
have you read 'Boring and Stupid'?"

63
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,080
Because that's what you are.

64
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:17,498
Nice.
- Thank you.

65
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:19,333
How long will it take you
to shut down the Neighbourhood?

66
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,877
Better part of a day, I'd guess.

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,337
In the meantime, why don't we
have a "farewell" party here tonight?

68
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:26,007
You know, just to thank the crew
for all the hard work?

69
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,675
We can jam to some tunes, you know?

70
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,137
Destroy the place, play beer pong
with Jason's testicles...

71
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,638
What do you say, boss?
- Sure.

72
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:35,308
By the way, I know what you're thinking.
"Maybe Janet can help."

73
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:36,851
Ah...
- You're wrong. Janet?

74
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:40,021
Oh, hi, little cuties!

75
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:42,273
I love you guys so much.

76
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,567
Except for you, Jason, because I hate you.

77
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:47,487
- I hate you.
- Janet? What's wrong?

78
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,030
Oh! Where's my phone?

79
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:52,533
We put a Restraining Bracelet on her,
disrupting her powers.

80
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:56,704
It's made of mag-a-nets.
Magnets. Mag-a-nittens...

81
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:01,793
Magnets are supposed to make me feel drunk,
but guess what? I feel fine.

82
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:09,675
I can't believe Michael betrayed us again.
Why is it always the ones you most expect?

83
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,346
I should've seen this coming.
No one can ever truly "turn over a new leaf."

84
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:16,933
Sure, Ben Affleck told me he'd matured
as an artist after he directed "Argo"

85
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:18,976
but then, right on schedule, it was

86
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,437
"Guess what, Tahani? I'm gonna be Batman!"

87
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:22,814
There's only one option.

88
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:26,776
Shawn clearly doesn't know that Michael
has rebooted this Neighbourhood 800 times.

89
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,695
I say we trade that information
for some kind of reduced sentence.

90
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,947
Chidi, they're monsters!

91
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,033
Who's to say they won't agree to a deal,
hear what we have to say

92
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:37,328
and then turn around and install us
into their horrible human zoo?

93
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,621
There's no other option.

94
00:04:38,663 --> 00:04:40,957
There's no way for a human
to get that bracelet off of Janet.

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,418
If there were, we could get her to call us
a train to Mindy St Claire's house.

96
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:47,880
We know for a fact that the people
from the Bad Place can't follow us there

97
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:49,966
- and I vote for that.
- I vote we...

98
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:54,345
No, sorry, and no offense, Jason,
but the stakes here are too high

99
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,182
to let someone with your limited
intellectual processing capacity weigh in.

100
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:00,560
I was gonna agree with you.
- Oh, great.

101
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,645
Well, that's two votes for my plan.

102
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,272
Eleanor. What do you think?

103
00:05:04,355 --> 00:05:07,525
Trade information on Michael,
or try to escape to the Medium Place?

104
00:05:08,568 --> 00:05:09,610
Neither.

105
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,863
I vote we ignore everything Michael just said

106
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,990
and blindly assume he's still on our side.

107
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,409
Who's with me?

108
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:19,245
Sorry, but when all this started

109
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:22,248
you're the one who told us
that Michael wasn't trustworthy.

110
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,542
- Now you want us to trust him?
- Yes.

111
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:28,129
For one very specific and rock-solid reason.

112
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:29,755
What's-his-name!

113
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:31,173
Who?

114
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:33,509
The dude! The super-depressing religious guy.

115
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:35,720
The real buzzkill, whose name
I can never remember.

116
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,889
Keeblers... car.

117
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,016
Kyra... Sedgwick?

118
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:42,602
Oh, I love her! Dear friend of mine.

119
00:05:43,352 --> 00:05:44,437
Not important right now.

120
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:46,105
Kierkegaard?
- Yes!

121
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:48,524
Kierkegaard! When Michael was mocking us

122
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:51,694
about trying to become better people,
whose name did he use, huh?

123
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:55,406
Kierkegaard.
I think he was sending us a message.

124
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,741
To take a leap of faith.

125
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,367
Cos that was Kierkegaard's thing, right?

126
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:02,163
Yes, although it's probably
better translated as a "leap into faith."

127
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,874
It's so hard to be your friend.
- Yup. Sorry.

128
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,834
Michael was telling us to trust him!

129
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:10,796
I had a long talk with him the other night,
about the whole Derek incident.

130
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,218
Dude was shook - talking about ethics,
and all spiralling about human stuff.

131
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,220
I think he's on our side.

132
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:21,557
Or maybe, he's a supernatural demon
designed to torture people

133
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:23,309
who just got offered his dream job

134
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,603
and has flipped on us
like a ten-stone griddle-chip!

135
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:30,858
It's a large pancake. Come on, people,
you can get these from context!

136
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:33,194
Look, maybe Michael jumped back
to the dark side.

137
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:34,570
But I don't think so.

138
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:37,031
I think he's going to help us escape.

139
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:40,409
I know it sounds crazy,
but if it weren't crazy

140
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:42,995
they wouldn't call it a "leap of faith."

141
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,500
They would call it a... "sit of doubting."

142
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:51,462
I never thought I'd be the one to say it...

143
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:54,090
but this is getting out of hand.

144
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:56,550
I think we gotta go to the cops.

145
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,762
What cops? Where do you think we are?

146
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,143
Before tonight's party I'd love to talk more
about your strategy for torturing Tahani.

147
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,604
I'm impressed you were able
to make her fall in love with Jason.

148
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,773
She must be... miserable.

149
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:14,485
Yeah, humans make a lot of mistakes
when they're horny.

150
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,657
Ah, boss... Give me a second, here.

151
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:23,369
What the here, dude?
- Vicky...

152
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:27,123
My hard work paid off for you,
and now you're just taking all the credit.

153
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,834
Vicky, Vicky... this can work out great
for both of us

154
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,419
if we play our cards right.

155
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:34,630
Shawn thinks that this is attempt
number two, right?

156
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:37,174
Now if I tell him that you've been in charge
of this version

157
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:40,928
he's eventually gonna find out that there
have been hundreds of failed versions.

158
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,514
Ohhhhh! Right.

159
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,641
And if that happens, we're all going down.

160
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:49,603
So, spread the word.
No one talks about the reboots.

161
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:52,481
Fine. But you better make this right.

162
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:55,234
Mama want promotion, ya heard?

163
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,537
Hello, you dummies!

164
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:10,499
This Neighbourhood was a labour
of hate for many people here

165
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,420
so I thought that we should celebrate
with an art form

166
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:18,215
that we literally invented here
in the Bad Place

167
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,259
the "comedy roast"!

168
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:25,765
I see Jason Mendoza's here.

169
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:28,100
Jason might not be
the smartest guy in the world

170
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:31,270
but he is the dumbest guy in the world.

171
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,814
Ah, Jason, buddy.

172
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,192
All you had to do was to keep quiet

173
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,945
but you couldn't stop talking
about Kendall Jenner

174
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,947
or that dumb quarterback, what was his name?

175
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:45,868
Derek Bortles...
always ranting about "Derek Bortles."

176
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:50,831
Lucky for you, my friend, Jaguars games
are the only ones televised in the Bad Place

177
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:52,917
because they suuuuck!

178
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:59,256
No, they don't! All we need is a defense,
and an offense, and some rule changes.

179
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,674
Don't take it personally.

180
00:09:00,758 --> 00:09:02,927
He just has to put on a show
for the other demons.

181
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,763
Tahani Al-Jamil.

182
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:08,849
Elegance, grace, sophistication...

183
00:09:08,933 --> 00:09:10,935
But enough about your sister!

184
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:16,357
Do you know what the worst moment
of Tahani's life was?

185
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,026
When the last song played
at one of her parties

186
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,489
and she would run off and cry because
she still hadn't won her parents' approval.

187
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:27,034
You know the other worst moment
of Tahani's life?

188
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:31,455
Every other moment of her empty,
pointless life!

189
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,791
Hey-o!

190
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:35,918
I see Eleanor Shellstrop is here.

191
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:38,629
Eleanor and I have a lot in common.

192
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,464
Now here's how you can tell us apart.

193
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:42,675
One of us is a manipulative demon

194
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:45,344
who's an expert
at making other people miserable...

195
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:48,013
and then the other one is me!

196
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:54,436
You thought you deserved a Medium Place,
like Mindy St Claire?

197
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,938
Are you kidding me?

198
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,648
You're bad, Eleanor.

199
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,985
This is exactly the place you should be.

200
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,612
Not super funny for a roast, there, bud.

201
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:04,864
Oh, sorry, you want a joke? OK.

202
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:08,659
You love Chidi and Chidi doesn't
love you back. Boom!

203
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,622
Now, that's funny because it's
very cruel and humiliating.

204
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,167
I consider you one of my closest friends.
- Not now, dude.

205
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,376
Speaking of Chidi...

206
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:20,087
is something no one has ever said

207
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:22,047
because no one talks about Chidi

208
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:26,844
because no one likes Chidi,
because he's so annoying about ethics!

209
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,306
Now when you taught the Trolley Problem...

210
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:35,394
did you secretly wish that it could be you
who wound up under the trolley?

211
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,396
Because all your students did!

212
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:39,064
Whoo!

213
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:41,275
Oh, Chidi, sorry, I got a joke for you, bud.

214
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:43,694
Uh, knock-knock.
- Who's there?

215
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,113
You died alone
because you couldn't commit to anyone!

216
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,075
"You died alone because you couldn't commit
to anyone" who?

217
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,077
No...
- Jason Mendoza!

218
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:59,793
OK, that's all my time.
Let's tear this mother to the ground!

219
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:02,046
Whoo!

220
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:11,513
So, maybe I was wrong,
and Michael isn't on our side.

221
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:16,560
What up, fork sticks?

222
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:19,563
That was "She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd.

223
00:11:20,022 --> 00:11:23,484
Coming up next,
"Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer!"

224
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,945
Idiots!

225
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,281
We're going streaking! Ahhhh!

226
00:11:30,866 --> 00:11:31,909
Ugh.

227
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:36,497
The one time I think someone isn't lying
to me and it bites me in the ash.

228
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,251
I guess Michael really did flip back
to the bad side.

229
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,543
Oh, does one think?

230
00:11:41,627 --> 00:11:43,879
That roast was the meanest thing
I've ever seen

231
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:46,715
and I once saw a waiter
bring Russell Crowe the wrong tea.

232
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,260
Well, we have no choice.
We go to Shawn and we tell him

233
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:51,178
that we'll trade secret information
about the reboots

234
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:52,388
if he'll go easy on us.

235
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:54,723
And if that doesn't work,
we try to get Janet free

236
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,642
and head to Mindy's. Agreed?

237
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,394
Yeah. Michael sucks now.

238
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:01,689
He pretended to be our friend,
he's gonna torture us for eternity...

239
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,357
And you know what the worst part is?

240
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,318
He doesn't remember the name
of my favourite football player.

241
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,736
Definitely not the worst part.

242
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,113
It is to me!

243
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:13,450
"Blake Bortles" is a cool name.
"Derek Bortles" is a dumb name!

244
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:19,081
♪ Grandma got run over by a reindeer ♪

245
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:22,459
♪ Walking home from our house
Christmas Eve... ♪

246
00:12:24,003 --> 00:12:28,257
Hey, man, have you told Shawn
how "hugely important" I was yet?

247
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,967
I will get to it. Promise.

248
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,928
Now, you just relax, enjoy yourself,
rip a cat in half

249
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,513
it's a party, Vicky! Come on!

250
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,975
Hey!
- Mleh?

251
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,060
What does Michael keep whispering to you?
- Um...

252
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:43,147
"Something, something,
Vicky, something, something."

253
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,482
Awww! Can I braid your hair?
- No.

254
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,318
Please?
- No. You know what? I'm good. I got it.

255
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:48,444
- Ooh!
- Hey!

256
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:50,279
Help me get these bracelets off Good Janet.

257
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:52,406
No. Shawn put them on her for a reason.

258
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,158
I'm not overruling the boss.

259
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,576
You're such a suck-up, Gayle.

260
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,287
Can I braid your hair?
- No. Get this... I got it.

261
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,413
Ow!
- OK...

262
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:02,166
Get your own bracelets, Victoria!

263
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,463
OK, you fat dinks.

264
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:10,090
The sun is up,
and we're about to close it down

265
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:11,842
with one last song -

266
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:14,303
"She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd

267
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:19,266
and "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"
played at the same time.

268
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:23,437
Honestly, I'm still partial
to the old-fashioned scorpion diapers.

269
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,022
But you've done great work here.

270
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:27,441
Can't thank you enough for everything.

271
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:29,610
Shawn, wait!
- No...

272
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,862
I have some very interesting information

273
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,114
about who's really responsible
for this Neighbourhood.

274
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:35,616
Shawn! The humans are escaping!

275
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,955
It's Michael. Michael's responsible
for this Neighbourhood

276
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,458
and everything that's happening right now.
Byeee!

277
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,335
Ah, I...
- Bad Janet!

278
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,545
What's cracking, nutbutts?

279
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,673
Call us another train, immediately.
Party's over.

280
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:56,470
How did they get Janet's bracelets off?

281
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:58,764
It's literally impossible for a human to do.

282
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:02,351
It's like breathing underwater,
or driving without texting.

283
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:06,105
Shawn, I don't want to make any accusations,
but I accuse Vicky.

284
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,565
She asked me to help her take
Janet's bracelets off.

285
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,734
Oh, Vicky, you didn't!

286
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:12,069
She definitely did.

287
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,406
She's jealous, she's been trying
to sabotage me the entire time.

288
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:17,116
What, no? He's lying.

289
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,536
OK, I did try to get the bracelets off,
but I couldn't.

290
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:22,329
Listen to yourself. You sound crazy.

291
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:26,458
Normally I would love hearing a man
tell a woman she's crazy, but I can't.

292
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,710
You aided the humans just to spite Michael.

293
00:14:28,794 --> 00:14:30,629
You're not a demon. You're a jerk.

294
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:32,005
Wait! This is a trick!

295
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:33,507
Michael is the traitor.

296
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,384
I bet they're still here somehow.

297
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:38,178
This place stretches for a thousand miles.

298
00:14:38,303 --> 00:14:40,139
Fine. Bad Janet?

299
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:43,267
- What?
- Scan the Neighbourhood, please.

300
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:54,194
No sign of any humans,
but I actually did find something for Vicky.

301
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:57,281
What?

302
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,660
Bad Janet, great stuff as always.
- No, duh.

303
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:03,537
And as for Vicky...
- No, wait!

304
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,208
This is a PR disaster.
We have to keep it all under wraps.

305
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:09,418
Get her on the train.

306
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:13,255
And if anyone else says a single word
of what happened here, to anyone...

307
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:15,257
you will be in a cocoon just like Vicky

308
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,343
and it is gooey in there.

309
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,471
How do we get the humans back from Mindy's?

310
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:22,639
They bought themselves some time,
but we'll get them.

311
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:24,391
I'll start the extradition papers.

312
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:27,686
You stay here. I want every trace
of this Neighbourhood erased.

313
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,281
Oh, that was a bad idea!

314
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:41,742
That was so scary,
so many different times. I hated that.

315
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:47,331
You guys!

316
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:50,626
I was so scared for you!

317
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:52,461
I told you he was on our side!

318
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,922
You're my friends, and I wanted...

319
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:58,592
I wanted to save you...
- Hey, it's OK, bud.

320
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:01,637
This is the best summer ever, you guys!

321
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,430
Ohhh!

322
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:05,390
Oh!

323
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:08,936
Oh, Michael,
we never doubted you for a moment.

324
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,020
Thank you, Tahani.

325
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:11,563
You're lying, though, right?

326
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:13,315
Yes, I am. I doubted you very strongly.

327
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:14,691
But then I figured it out.

328
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,193
Kierkegaard, baby!

329
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,319
Leap of faith!

330
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:20,155
It's better translated as a
"leap into faith."

331
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,281
You remembered!

332
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:25,160
Can somebody please explain what happened?

333
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:27,829
And... and can you guys just be...
a tiny bit quieter?

334
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:30,415
Because, um...
I've been drunk on magnets all day and...

335
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:33,961
and I can literally
hear every sound in the universe.

336
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:37,923
Basically, Michael sent us a code,
and we had to crack it.

337
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:40,384
- I figured out the first clue.
- No, you didn't. I did.

338
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:42,469
- I was there, though!
- Ooh...

339
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:46,515
"Blake Bortles" is a cool name.
"Derek Bortles" is a dumb name.

340
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,433
Yes...

341
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:53,272
"Derek Bortles" is indeed a very dumb name.

342
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:54,940
It's a clue!

343
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,985
There's no way Michael
would've forgotten the name "Blake Bortles."

344
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:59,570
You say it a million times a day.

345
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:01,613
Cos he's the best.
- No, he's not.

346
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,614
And even I know that.

347
00:17:02,698 --> 00:17:06,410
Michael was telling us to use Derek,
Janet's Derek, for something.

348
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,246
There were clues in the roast.

349
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,416
Everybody, quietly, but quickly,
head to the train station.

350
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,294
But let's split up so we don't draw
attention.

351
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:25,887
Ugh, you guys are the worst conspirators!

352
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:31,435
OK, what else did Michael say
in the roasts that might be meaningful?

353
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:32,728
Tahani? Do you remember?

354
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:35,439
Well, he said my entire life
was pointless and empty.

355
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,649
Yeah, but did he say anything
we don't already know?

356
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:39,192
Anything that stood out?

357
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:43,697
Do you know what the worst moment
of Tahani's life was?

358
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,533
When the last song
played at one of her parties

359
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:50,996
and she would run off and cry because
she still hadn't won her parents' approval.

360
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,497
That was odd.

361
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:55,083
A host never runs off during their last song

362
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,209
because after it's over

363
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,545
you're supposed to act surprised
when everyone drags you on stage

364
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,630
and showers you with applause.

365
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:02,924
Maybe Michael wanted us
to wait until the end of the party

366
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:05,093
when everyone was at their most distracted.

367
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:08,764
And use Derek to drive the train,
because he has some of Janet's powers.

368
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:11,350
- Janet?
- Hi... Hi... Hi there.

369
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:12,476
Janet?
- Yep?

370
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,603
We need you to go get Derek from your void.

371
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:15,562
OK.

372
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:17,689
Shoot, where's my void, again? I forget.

373
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,691
Oh, yeah, it's everywhere.

374
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,902
OK, hang on to your...

375
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,654
butt-cheeks.

376
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:25,489
Ugh... where is he?

377
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,616
Ow! Owwy! Ugh!

378
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,660
I'm never gonna find... oop, there he is!

379
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,620
- Derek.
- Derek!

380
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:35,248
We need you to drive this train,
and take us to Mindy St Claire's house.

381
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,667
Can you do that?

382
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,584
Derek.

383
00:18:39,294 --> 00:18:40,170
Wait.

384
00:18:40,629 --> 00:18:41,755
Nobody get on that train.

385
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:43,882
Derek?
- Why not?

386
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:45,342
Because of what Michael said to me.

387
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,428
You thought you deserved a Medium Place?

388
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:51,973
You're bad, Eleanor.
This is exactly the place you should be.

389
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:53,975
Derek!

390
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,228
Michael wants us to stay here,
for some reason.

391
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,981
Eleanor. We have a train, a conductor,
and a safe destination.

392
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,108
I'm gonna tell you the same thing

393
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:04,361
I told Pippa Middleton right before
we went paragliding in Gibraltar.

394
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,696
"Let's go!"

395
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:09,241
What? It's what I said.
- Guys, leap of faith.

396
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,618
Michael said we shouldn't get on that train.

397
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:13,704
Any minute now, those demons
are gonna come looking for us.

398
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:16,540
Where are we supposed to hide? Oh, no!

399
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:20,168
Now when you taught the Trolley Problem,
did you secretly wish

400
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:23,880
that it could be you
who wound up under the trolley?

401
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:26,049
Because all your students did!

402
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,969
All aboard the...

403
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,763
Shhh!
- DEREK, QUIETLY:... train is here!

404
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:33,557
It's a train!
- Shhh!

405
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,267
Get onboard!

406
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,435
Actually, Derek...

407
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:37,894
Derek.
- You're gonna wait

408
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:40,188
until the last song of the night.
- Derek.

409
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:43,024
And when you do leave,
you're gonna be flying a solo mission.

410
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:46,194
Oh! Maximum Derek!

411
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,320
Derek headed off

412
00:19:47,362 --> 00:19:50,157
and when the new train arrived,
the four of us crawled underneath

413
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,242
before any of the drunk demons saw us.

414
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,953
That kept us from being detected
when Bad Janet scanned the Neighbourhood.

415
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:57,789
We fooled those mo-fos like the chumps
they are!

416
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,459
We got all four clues you left us!

417
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,668
Oh, that's great.

418
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:05,756
Well, I mean, I actually left you
more than 1,200 clues

419
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,966
because of how primitive your brains are.

420
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:10,802
But I'm so glad
you got enough to figure it out.

421
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:13,096
Wait, how did you escape detection though?

422
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,434
Well, I'm not ethically proud of this,
but I framed Vicky.

423
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:22,022
It was pretty easy - I just kept whispering
things into Janet's ear to make her paranoid.

424
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:24,983
I'm sorry, what... what did you whisper
to me? I don't remember.

425
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:29,571
Something, something, Vicky,
something, something.

426
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:31,323
What does Michael keep whispering to you?

427
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:34,534
"Something, something, Vicky,
something, something."

428
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:35,452
Aw!

429
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:38,079
And that made her try to take
Janet's bracelets off...

430
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,664
which framed her for the escape.

431
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:41,249
Oh!

432
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,212
Guys, I... I want to apologise
for roasting you earlier.

433
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:47,923
I had to sell it because everyone
was watching.

434
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,466
It was funny though, right?

435
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:52,093
Absolutely not!
- The Tahani stuff was perfect. I mean, no.

436
00:20:52,177 --> 00:20:54,846
Guys. Let's just take a moment here.

437
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,223
They're gone.

438
00:20:56,306 --> 00:20:59,226
Which means that we won
and might actually get a chance

439
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,894
to go to the real Good Place.

440
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:03,605
This is everything we ever wanted.

441
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:05,357
Speaking of people getting what they want...

442
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,193
I really hope Mindy liked the present
we sent her.

443
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,364
Who are you?
- Derek!

444
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,993
"Thanks for helping us all those times
we showed up."

445
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:21,039
"To repay you, here's a willing sex robot
and two duffel bags full of cocaine."

446
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,750
There are wind chimes
where my dingdong should be.

447
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:29,381
I can work with that.
- Alright!
