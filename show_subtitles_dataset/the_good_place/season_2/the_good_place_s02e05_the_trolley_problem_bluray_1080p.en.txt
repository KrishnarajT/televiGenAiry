1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:02,952
This is an exciting day.

2
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:07,415
We are going to tackle one of the most famous
ethical dilemmas

3
00:00:07,873 --> 00:00:08,958
The Trolley Problem.

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,210
Is this a game? I go first! I call blue!

5
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:12,670
There's no... No, this is...

6
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:13,963
No.

7
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:19,802
This is a thought experiment first introduced
by British philosopher Philippa Foot

8
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:21,053
in 1967.

9
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:25,182
You are driving a trolley
when the brakes fail.

10
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:30,688
And on the track ahead of you
are five workmen that you will run over.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,066
Now, you can steer to another track

12
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:36,861
but on that track
is one person you would kill

13
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:39,238
instead of the five.
What do you do?

14
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:41,198
Do we know anything about the people?

15
00:00:41,365 --> 00:00:43,284
Like, is one of them an ex-boyfriend

16
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,828
or that snooty girl from Rite Aid

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,330
who was always silently judging
my purchases?

18
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:50,750
It's like, "Yeah, chicky! A Baby Ruth
and birth control."

19
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,668
"I see the irony. Keep a-swiping!"

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,712
You don't know any of the workers.

21
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:56,047
OK, well then, that's easy.

22
00:00:56,088 --> 00:00:58,382
I switch tracks, kill one person
instead of five.

23
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:00,676
But this is hard, cos the only trolley
I've ever been on

24
00:01:00,718 --> 00:01:02,386
is James Franco's ironic trolley

25
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:06,390
it travels backwards from his penguin grotto
to his garage of adult tricycles.

26
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,685
Um... kill one, save five.

27
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:12,438
I kill the one guy, but me and the five
other guys

28
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:15,733
we get together every year,
no matter how busy we are

29
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,235
and we pour one out for our flat homie.

30
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:19,612
Good!

31
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:20,988
We'd all switch tracks.

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,948
But there's a lot of other versions of this.

33
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,867
Like, what if you knew one of the people?

34
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:26,702
Does that change the equation?

35
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:29,288
Or what if you're not the driver,
you're just a bystander?

36
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:31,749
Or let's throw the trolley out altogether.

37
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:36,170
Let's say you're a doctor,
and you can save five patients.

38
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:39,757
But you have to kill one healthy person

39
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,926
and use his organs to do it.

40
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,260
But that's not the same thing.

41
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:44,220
But why not?

42
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:48,724
It's still choosing to kill one person
to save five, isn't it?

43
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,142
Michael.

44
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:52,520
You've been kind of quiet.
What do you think about all this?

45
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:55,689
Well, obviously the dilemma is clear.

46
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:58,109
How do you kill all six people?

47
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,028
So, I would dangle a sharp blade
out the window

48
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,572
to slice the neck of the guy
on the other track

49
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,991
as we smoosh our five main guys.

50
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:09,411
Oh...

51
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,330
I did the thing again, didn't I?

52
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,873
Yep. Ten more, buddy.

53
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,000
People. Good. People... Gah.

54
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,710
Why is that so hard to remember?

55
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:17,711
People...

56
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:19,004
what is it?

57
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:19,922
Good.
- Good.

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,098
Cool. Later, guys.

59
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:34,019
Oh, hey, twerps. We have an hour before
we have to pretend to be tortured by Vicky.

60
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:36,397
You wanna hang out? We could work on our
forced grins?

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,356
Check mine out.

62
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:41,152
"Oh, this place is miserable! Etcetera!"

63
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:43,279
That sounds fun.
- Right?

64
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,448
But I was going to dive into next week's
reading, I'm afraid, sorry.

65
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,742
Jason, do you, um... care to join?

66
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:49,743
Sure, dog.

67
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:52,163
You're doing extra-credit work?

68
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,915
What can I say? This class is more fun
than I thought.

69
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:02,548
Eleanor seemed a little suspicious
earlier...

70
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:04,133
snooping around.

71
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:06,760
You didn't tell her about us, did you?

72
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:08,304
No.

73
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,765
Why are you so scared that someone will know
we're pounding it out?

74
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,227
Precisely because you refer to love-making
as "pounding it out."

75
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,564
Who cares about what other people might think
about us being together?

76
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,650
Maybe you should talk about this
with a friend.

77
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:25,112
But then that person would know
we were together.

78
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:28,949
Right. Then you can talk about why it is
that you don't want anyone to know

79
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:29,867
we're together.

80
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,494
But then that person would know
and I don't want anyone to know.

81
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:33,454
I know.

82
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:36,832
I'm saying you should talk to someone
about how weird it is

83
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:39,627
that you don't want to talk to someone
about how we're together.

84
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:42,796
How's it going, Teach?

85
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,798
Mm, kitchen looks nice and crazy.

86
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:47,843
I've been wracking my brain, trying to find
a way to get through to Michael.

87
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:51,597
What do you think about writing a rap musical
about Kierkegaard?

88
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:53,057
I think that's a terrible idea.

89
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:53,974
Cool.

90
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:59,647
Michael's not going to learn
how to be a good person overnight.

91
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:01,148
He's not even a person. He's just a...

92
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,402
bunch of evil shoved up
the butt of an evil mannequin.

93
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,780
You know, teaching him to be good,
it's like...

94
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:09,782
teaching me how to be not hot.

95
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:11,033
How would you even do it?

96
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:14,328
You'd have me hunch or something,
and stand there and say

97
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:15,579
"Gurp."

98
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:16,705
"Gurp."

99
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:18,123
"Gurp."

100
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,125
I don't even know. I can't even picture it

101
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,253
because I've been hot my whole life.
- I'm sorry...

102
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,463
who is this conversation for again?
- It's for you.

103
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,382
I believe in you, nerd-boy.

104
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,053
If you can teach me and Jason ethics,
you can teach anybody.

105
00:04:31,553 --> 00:04:32,429
Thanks.

106
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,350
But definitely a "no" on the rap musical?

107
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:38,018
I mean, if you really—

108
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,145
♪ My name is Kierkegaard
and my writing is impeccable ♪

109
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:42,189
♪ Check out my Teleological
suspension of the ethical! ♪

110
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:43,357
No.
- No!

111
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,400
Right?

112
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,985
Nah, felt like a "no" when I was doing it.

113
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,530
Janet?

114
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,447
Hi there.

115
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,449
If I were to tell you something personal
about myself

116
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:54,743
you couldn't tell anyone about it, right?
- Right.

117
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,204
So in a way, you're sort of like a therapist?

118
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:58,163
Absolutely not.

119
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:02,543
A therapist is a trained medical professional
with the ability to absorb and process

120
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:04,878
complex ideas about human emotion.

121
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:08,882
I am simply a vessel containing all of the
knowledge in the universe.

122
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:10,134
Close enough.

123
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,303
Jason and I are sleeping together.
- OK.

124
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:14,680
Obviously, no one can ever know.
I mean, I wouldn't shag Jason

125
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:16,181
if he were the last man on Earth.

126
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,269
But, well he sort of is and I am.
Shagging him, I mean.

127
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:22,855
And I think I'm losing my mind.
So please help me.

128
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:26,942
Well, my job is to make your experience here
in the afterlife more enjoyable

129
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:28,569
so I will try to help you.

130
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:32,197
I am going to need some time to read
every book ever written

131
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:33,824
about human psychotherapy.

132
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,951
And now I've done that, so let's begin.

133
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,411
Have a seat.

134
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,582
Hi. I'm your therapist, Janet.

135
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,044
I just want to have a little chat
about your progress.

136
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,381
In the last homework assignment,
I asked you to examine the ethics

137
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:53,052
of "Les Miserables," in which a man
steals a loaf of bread

138
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,303
to feed his starving family.

139
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:57,806
Would you...
please read your first paragraph, here?

140
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:02,227
"Everyone in this story sucks
and belongs in the Bad Place."

141
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:06,357
"The thief is bad, the officer
chasing him is bad"

142
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:08,567
"all the whiny prostitutes are bad"

143
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:12,112
"plus they're all French so they're
going to the Bad Place automatically."

144
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:15,574
Do you see how you're already off-topic?

145
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:18,035
Chidi, I... I've been around a long time.

146
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,828
Like, all of it.

147
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:23,082
But I know for a fact that if you steal
a loaf of bread

148
00:06:23,123 --> 00:06:25,084
it's a negative seventeen points.

149
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,670
Twenty if it's a baguette,
because that makes you more French.

150
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:29,588
OK, sure

151
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,967
but philosophy is about questioning things
that you take for granted

152
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,428
and I just don't think
that you're doing that.

153
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,474
I mean, "I personally know that Victor Hugo
is in the Bad Place"

154
00:06:40,516 --> 00:06:41,558
"being tortured."

155
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:46,063
"He's a real wuss, too. If one of the lava
monsters even gets near the guy"

156
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:50,526
"he's like, 'Sacré bleu, I peed in m'pants.'"

157
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:54,488
I don't know what you want from me.
That... that's exactly what he said.

158
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,616
Jason's a nice person, but...

159
00:06:58,075 --> 00:07:00,994
my suitors were always of a certain echelon.

160
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:02,871
I used what I called the "Duke Rule"

161
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:06,500
because "Duke" is both minimum acceptable
University and rank of nobility.

162
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,753
You've never dated anyone
like Jason before.

163
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,797
I mean, I've dallied below my station.

164
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,883
I once had a brief fling with a non-famous
Hemsworth brother.

165
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:18,053
But even Larry Hemsworth had more status
than Jason.

166
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:20,055
Jason didn't even have a job.
- Mm.

167
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:22,850
In a sad way, not in the good, rich way.

168
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,185
Hi, guys. What are you doing?

169
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,603
Sitting in a room?

170
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,147
That's pretty cool.

171
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:31,692
I took your suggestion, and I'm talking
to Janet about our relationship.

172
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:34,987
Actually, it might help me if I could hear
Jason's side as well.

173
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:37,322
Oh, no, no. That'll only slow things down.
Look, I'll tell you his side.

174
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:40,117
He thinks that I have to control everything
and that he has no voice

175
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,119
in this relationship. Right, Jason? Good.

176
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,328
Now, where were we?

177
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,416
I just heard that.

178
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:49,376
OK, fine. I'll leave.

179
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:54,173
I just don't feel like you're engaging
with the material.

180
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:56,425
- Oh, come on.
- Like with the trolley problem.

181
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,594
That was just tricky, that's all.

182
00:07:58,635 --> 00:08:00,846
Why don't you just tell me the right answer?

183
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:03,098
Well, that's what's so great about the
trolley problem

184
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,142
is that there is no right answer.

185
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:09,563
This is why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

186
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:10,981
I'm on your side here, dude.

187
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,149
But he is not wrong.

188
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,651
OK. Michael, trust me.

189
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,532
When it comes to human ethics,
I just know more than you.

190
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:23,952
I've been studying it my whole life.

191
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:26,121
It's just that it's so theoretical, you know?

192
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,418
I mean, you know, maybe there's a more
concrete approach.

193
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,213
Here. Let's... let's try this.

194
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,257
Oh, God!

195
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,051
Michael, what did you do?

196
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:41,428
I made the trolley problem real

197
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,473
so we could see how the ethics
would actually play out.

198
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,518
There are five workers on this track,
and one over there.

199
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:49,811
Here are the levers to switch the tracks.

200
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:50,812
Make a choice!

201
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,940
The thing is... I mean, ethically speaking...

202
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:55,442
No time, dude! Make a decision!
- Well, it's tricky.

203
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:58,654
I mean on the one hand, if you ascribe to a
purely Utilitarian worldview...

204
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:04,868
OK. So...

205
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:07,579
What'd we learn?

206
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:11,917
Chidi?

207
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:13,585
Talk it out, buddy.

208
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:16,046
What are we thinking?

209
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,507
He thinks he just killed a bunch of people
with a trolley.

210
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:19,883
It's just a simulation.

211
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:22,094
I would never make you kill real people.

212
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,720
Oh, well, that's reassuring.

213
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:28,475
Because some of the parts of the fake people
flew into my mouth!

214
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,811
Michael, can we just go back
to the classroom?

215
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:31,770
We never left.

216
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:33,897
Here, I'll show you.

217
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:36,191
Ah...

218
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,026
Yeah.

219
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:38,944
OK...

220
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:40,862
Look, see, buddy?

221
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:42,656
- None of this was real.
- Well...

222
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:45,576
Uh... I... I mean, their pain is real.

223
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:49,871
It's like they're fake people,
but their deaths are real.

224
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:51,123
Does that make sense?

225
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:54,084
There have to be stakes or it's just another
thought experiment.

226
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,335
This is awful.

227
00:09:55,544 --> 00:10:00,048
You specifically asked me if there was a way
I could connect with the material more.

228
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:02,968
I'm trying, you guys.

229
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,096
Sorry.

230
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:07,472
You're right.

231
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,517
I want to help you understand this.
- Thank you, Chidi.

232
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:13,895
So. Let's try again, mm?

233
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:17,024
Oh, um... I... I thought maybe we would
have a discussion.

234
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,235
No, the whole point is to play out
the scenario in real time.

235
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:21,820
Quick, Chidi! What's your decision?

236
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:23,238
OK, OK, I can do this.

237
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:27,743
I am choosing to switch tracks, so that way
I only kill one person.

238
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,953
Oh, forgot to tell you...

239
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:32,664
this is the scenario where you actually know
one of the people.

240
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:34,458
It's your friend Henry, there.

241
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,044
Chidi! How are you, mate?

242
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:37,961
Henry! Move!

243
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,671
Aw! Nice trolley!

244
00:10:39,713 --> 00:10:41,548
- Move out of the way!
- I can't, Chidi.

245
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,842
My boots are stuck in the tracks.
- Henry, move!

246
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:45,719
- Anyway, long time no—
- Get outta there!

247
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,639
Oh, my God!

248
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:52,142
Again, just the simulation.

249
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:55,979
An almost impossibly life-like simulation.

250
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,523
Would someone's foot really fly off
their body like that?

251
00:10:58,565 --> 00:10:59,858
That was kinda cool.

252
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:02,444
Ethically speaking.

253
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:05,238
Tahani's confusing.

254
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,948
Mm.
- She's really smart.

255
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:10,202
And she's all soft and smooth
like a bunch of water balloons

256
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:13,789
but I tell her she's pretty
a hundred times a day

257
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,541
and she's never said I'm pretty once.

258
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,919
She always wants me to be different
from how I am.

259
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,130
But I'm not different. I'm same!

260
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,299
And how does that make you feel?

261
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,135
I just feel like Tahani's embarrassed
that I'm not some sort of scientist

262
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:28,637
who forecloses on banks.

263
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:30,305
I need another session with Janet.

264
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:32,432
It's my turn. I have a lot of problems too,
you know.

265
00:11:32,766 --> 00:11:36,728
Perhaps we could kill two birds
with one Janet, as it were.

266
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,272
How would you feel about giving Jason and me
"couples therapy?"

267
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:40,857
I'd feel great.

268
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:48,407
Janet? What's happening?

269
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:49,658
Unclear.

270
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,119
My guess is I'm operating in a way
I'm not designed for

271
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,704
and it's creating a small glitch.

272
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,039
But if I'm helping you guys, I say

273
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:58,542
"What has one thumb and wants to keep going?"

274
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,168
"This not-lady."

275
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:01,503
Eh?

276
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:03,171
Eh?

277
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,510
OK, so that was Trolley Problem version
number seven.

278
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:11,930
Chidi opted to run over five
William Shakespeares

279
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:14,850
instead of one Santa Claus.

280
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:17,936
OK, as much as I'm enjoying watching random
people's heads fly off

281
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:21,064
I think we've taken this trolley thing
as far as it can go.

282
00:12:21,356 --> 00:12:22,607
You might be right, Eleanor.

283
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,067
Thank you.

284
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,611
Let's try the doctor one.

285
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,530
Dude! What the fork?

286
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:32,117
These five people all need organ
transplants or they will die.

287
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,702
Eleanor's perfectly healthy.

288
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,579
Chidi, do you want to slice her open

289
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,497
and use her organs to save the five
sick people?

290
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,082
Chidi! Chidi. Think about this.

291
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,542
I'm your hottest friend.

292
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:41,668
No. Tahani.

293
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,545
I'm your nicest fr...
No. Jason.

294
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:44,880
I'm your friend.

295
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:46,798
Save five people.

296
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:48,884
No, I... I won't do it.

297
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:52,304
As a doctor, I've taken the Hippocratic oath,
to do no harm.

298
00:12:52,345 --> 00:12:53,597
And although five people will die

299
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:57,142
I cannot harm one innocent person
to save them, and forsake my oath.

300
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,393
It's unethical.

301
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:00,729
OK.

302
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:02,189
Tell their families.
- What?

303
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:07,235
Doctor Chidi?

304
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:11,823
My daddy needed a heart transplant.
Did you save his life?

305
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,534
I don't know what I would do
without my daddy.

306
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,498
He was working, then a really bad man
ran him over with a trolley.

307
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,917
Oh, come on!

308
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:23,043
What?

309
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:25,045
I'm finding this incredibly helpful.

310
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:27,088
I think I'm really starting to get it.

311
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:28,089
Oh, I know.

312
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:31,009
We'll do the one where you're in a boat
next to a volcano

313
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:35,305
and you can either save 50 people
or one awesome dog or whatever.

314
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,182
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
- Hey!

315
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,809
Are you torturing us again?

316
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,435
What?

317
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,771
You don't care about learning ethics lessons.

318
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:44,815
You're just torturing Chidi again,
aren't you?

319
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,484
Busted!
- What?

320
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:53,532
I'm sorry. Old habits die hard.

321
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,660
Not as hard as those people you crushed
with the trolley, though.

322
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,119
Boom!
- I'm sorry, is this...

323
00:13:58,161 --> 00:13:59,037
is this funny to you?

324
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,373
Yeah, I thought that was clear
from my laughter.

325
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:03,416
Oh, come on.

326
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,962
My bad. Look, I'm still on your team.

327
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,923
OK? I just needed to let off a little steam.

328
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:11,550
Whoo...

329
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:13,260
See? Back home, all good.

330
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,929
No. No. Not all good.

331
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,683
You keep saying that we need you
or we'll end up getting tortured forever

332
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:23,395
but then when we do help you out,
we still end up getting tortured

333
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:27,190
I'd rather just be tortured than choose it.

334
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,484
You are no longer welcome in my class.

335
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,361
Get the fork out!

336
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,952
But I said, "My bad."

337
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:40,328
Out!

338
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:45,333
That was some pretty impressive
nerd rage yesterday.

339
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,918
Didn't know you had it in you.

340
00:14:48,795 --> 00:14:49,671
You OK?

341
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:52,465
You've been staring at the second page
of this book for an hour.

342
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:58,096
When I'm really upset, concentrating on a
Table of Contents helps me calm down.

343
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:02,100
It's like a menu, but the food is words.

344
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,852
Oh... OK.

345
00:15:03,894 --> 00:15:07,063
I can't believe I actually thought he wanted
to learn from us.

346
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:08,899
What he really wanted was to torture me.

347
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,942
Using the thing that I love most
in the world.

348
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:11,902
Woven belts?

349
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:13,862
Oh, teaching, right.

350
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:16,823
I'm sorry about this, Chidi.

351
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:20,577
I made him take the classes
and I feel a little responsible.

352
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,329
No, no, it's not your fault.

353
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,122
Yeah, you're right, it isn't,
and no take-backs!

354
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:25,957
No, a tiger can't change his stripes.

355
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,585
This is what he always wanted.

356
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,505
Me trying desperately to teach him something
that he never intended to learn

357
00:15:32,547 --> 00:15:35,550
so I'd end up miserable with my glasses
all smudged up

358
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,469
from sweaty forehead stress-grease.

359
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,514
OK. Gross. Also, I really don't think
that's true.

360
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:42,682
Oh, no?

361
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:46,686
What possible other reason could he have
to behave that way?

362
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:50,023
Actually, I can think of one.

363
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:53,360
Yesterday, Tahani gave us her reasons

364
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,528
not to take this relationship public.

365
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:56,780
Jason.

366
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,782
How did that make you feel?

367
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:00,450
Like she's being a jerk.

368
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,037
OK, let's try that again, and this time,
I want you to use an "I" statement.

369
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:05,288
OK, um...

370
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,002
"Tahani is being a jerk," said I, Jason

371
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:14,214
Tahani, what do you value about Jason?

372
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,342
Well, he's nice, thoughtful.
