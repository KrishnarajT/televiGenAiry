1
00:00:01,307 --> 00:00:05,228
OK, I don't know about you guys,
but I say we leave this miserable shirthole.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,147
No, wait, wait. Not so fast.

3
00:00:07,188 --> 00:00:10,400
Now, getting to the Good Place
is pretty tricky

4
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:11,860
there's no train to catch.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,448
I have to design a complicated,
unique transportation vehicle.

6
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:17,866
Is it Optimus Prime?

7
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:20,577
What?
- I can't believe we get to ride a real-life

8
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:22,412
Optimus Prime! I call right nipple!

9
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:24,706
That's "Shotgun" on Optimus Prime.

10
00:00:24,747 --> 00:00:28,877
Look, this vehicle, which is decidedly not
Optimus Prime...

11
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:29,961
Aw!

12
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:33,256
has never been built before.
So, I'm gonna need a few days to do this.

13
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,633
Dude, we just escaped
by the skin of our teeth

14
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:39,262
and any second now, Shawn is gonna realise
that we are not at Mindy St Clair's.

15
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,849
So, whatever this magical
Good Place-mobile is

16
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:44,684
now's the time to whip it out, B!

17
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:47,353
I agree. And although I believe
I've asked you this question already...

18
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:48,813
There is no "business class."

19
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:50,732
Michael, they're right. We gotta go.

20
00:00:53,735 --> 00:00:55,069
Oh. Let's do...

21
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:57,947
OK, here goes nothing. Janet, if you would?

22
00:00:58,364 --> 00:01:01,493
Aaaand presto!

23
00:01:02,118 --> 00:01:03,703
Oops.

24
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:05,371
Forgot to log in first.

25
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:07,999
Gotta answer my, uh... security question.

26
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,668
"What was the name of your childhood pet?"

27
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:12,921
Korzoff... the Ten-Headed...

28
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:14,506
Dog-Spider.

29
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:17,091
Aaaand presto!

30
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:20,970
Dope!

31
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:22,764
We did it, guys.

32
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:23,681
We won.

33
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,600
We're going to the Good Place.

34
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:27,602
In a frickin' gold balloon!

35
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:28,520
Shotgun!

36
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,647
It's a hot air balloon,
what does that even mean?

37
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,234
Top of the balloon! Ultimate shotgun.

38
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:43,660
Guys, just a reminder

39
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:46,746
I have no idea what's going to happen
once we actually

40
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:48,498
reach the Good Place.

41
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,418
You know, we're trying to slip in
through a kind of side door

42
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,295
and even if that works

43
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:57,048
we have no way of knowing
if they'll let us stay.

44
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,384
Of course they'll let us stay -
we're refugees.

45
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:02,095
I mean, what kind of a messed-up place
would turn away refugees?

46
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:03,888
Quite agree. We should get a move on.

47
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,766
Obviously, if I'd known we'd be ballooning,
I would've worn a proper ballooning outfit

48
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:08,643
but time is of the essence, so...

49
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,771
Tahani. Yeah, no, no, don't.
Don't touch that.

50
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:13,189
It's probably locked.

51
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,191
It's a very complicated control system.

52
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:18,111
I may need a few minutes
to get a handle on this.

53
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,781
Why don't you all go say goodbye
to the Neighbourhood?

54
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:24,325
Oh, then I could change into a proper
ballooning outfit!

55
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:25,451
Oh, hurrah!

56
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:27,579
Are you making fun of me?

57
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:30,206
No, I legit wanna see you in that outfit.

58
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,165
Oh!

59
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,256
So many memories of this place -

60
00:02:38,298 --> 00:02:40,800
eating frozen yogurt and then having diarrhea

61
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:42,468
and then eating more frozen yogurt

62
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,720
and then more diarrhea.

63
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,598
Maybe I should've realized this wasn't
the Good Place

64
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,849
because of all the diarrhea.

65
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,476
Maybe you shouldn't be eating all that
frozen yogurt right now.

66
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:52,562
We're about to be on a balloon, man.

67
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,856
What do you think our new home will be like?

68
00:02:54,897 --> 00:02:58,067
I'm picturing Hawaiian beach,
unlimited Mai Tais

69
00:02:58,901 --> 00:02:59,986
and a phone!

70
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:04,282
Ugh, I miss my phone so much.
I bet I have so many texts.

71
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:07,160
I just want us all to be together.
Separate houses, obviously.

72
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,703
Large lawns.

73
00:03:08,828 --> 00:03:10,580
I'd have a tasteful moat.

74
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,168
I don't care where I live, as long as
they have more of this frozen yogurt.

75
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,628
Why? Why?

76
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:18,880
An unlimited library

77
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:21,758
all of my philosopher heroes walking around

78
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,177
waiting to be engaged in rigorous
intellectual debate.

79
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:26,596
And I hope that library is air-conditioned

80
00:03:26,638 --> 00:03:29,515
because we are gonna be working up
quite a sweat!

81
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:31,059
Oh! And soulmates!

82
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,310
I hope they're real.

83
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,063
I mean... you know...

84
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:36,397
for... for all of us.

85
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:39,275
I mean, I hope everyone gets someone special.

86
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,443
Uh, mm...

87
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:43,071
Good news!
We've got a handle on the controls.

88
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:45,114
Who's ready to go ballooning?

89
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:47,200
OK, I think we figured it out.

90
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:51,245
I pieced together this design
from a number of ancient manuscripts

91
00:03:51,287 --> 00:03:52,955
which Janet will now interpret for you.

92
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:57,043
"The balloon will only transport those
who have attained self-realisation."

93
00:03:57,168 --> 00:04:00,755
"Each traveler will step upon the scale,
and her soul shall be weighed."

94
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:04,217
"If she is the best version of herself,
it will permit her to board."

95
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:06,386
"If not, passage will be denied."

96
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:07,845
Cool.

97
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,097
Cool. Cool.

98
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:10,014
We got this.

99
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:14,394
I don't know about you guys, but I am
definitely the best version of myself.

100
00:04:14,435 --> 00:04:18,439
I know a shirt-ton about ethics now,
because I studied.

101
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:23,069
And I read books, that weren't even written
by the "Real Housewives."

102
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:26,572
Relax, everyone. We're all gonna be fine.

103
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:33,538
Oh, man, I didn't believe anything
I was saying. I just...

104
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,747
Whoo! In I go.

105
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:41,045
Well, I mean...

106
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:48,094
Oh, dip!

107
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,766
Ah, nuts!

108
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:54,684
It's OK!

109
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:56,728
The pattern is "green-green-green-red."

110
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,479
Remember that when it starts up again.

111
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,647
I'm sorry, everyone.

112
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:03,359
I just have some worries,
as well as some concerns

113
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,069
that could potentially turn into
outright fears.

114
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,946
Ah, there they go. Ah, they're...

115
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:08,364
they're fears now. I'm scared.

116
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:09,949
OK, I know this mood.

117
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,660
Come with us, Doctor Freak-Out.

118
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:15,872
That was a joke.
We're actually very good friends.

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,248
OK, here's the thing.

120
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,753
That balloon wants us to be the best version
of ourselves, but for the four of us

121
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:22,962
that's not just a metaphor.

122
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:26,591
It doesn't just mean, "are we the nicest
that we've ever been?" or something

123
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:29,177
although I am also worried about that.

124
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:34,640
But the real issue here is that there have
been literally 802 different versions of us!

125
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:37,518
And how do I know that this version
is the best version of myself?

126
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,812
How do I know it's not version number 85?

127
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:41,981
Or 322? Or 558?

128
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:43,566
Or 69 or 420!

129
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,985
You know, and... and then you get
into the whole idea of...

130
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:48,404
of consciousness. And, I mean,
just forget about "best"

131
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:50,364
what version of Chidi is even real?

132
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:54,202
I mean, I think that "I" am here,
but what if the real "I"

133
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:56,621
is one of those other Chidis, and... and...

134
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:58,456
and this Chidi is an imposter!

135
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,666
What happens here?
Does he eventually tire himself out?

136
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,126
Usually, but this one seems to be

137
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,128
getting stronger as he goes on.

138
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,172
over time, because our consciousness
is constantly changing.

139
00:06:06,214 --> 00:06:08,758
Which is just playing on the Buddhist
doctrine of the "non-self."

140
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,594
Plus, physically, our cells change
every seven years, which doesn't matter

141
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:12,970
because we're dead.

142
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,181
OK. This is pretty simple, bud.

143
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:19,727
You've been our teacher this whole time
and we are much better because of you.

144
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:24,065
If we're the best versions of ourselves,
which that balloon just proved

145
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:26,692
then you definitely are.

146
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:28,778
So, in a way, it...

147
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,115
it doesn't matter if I was "better"
in version 492 or whatever

148
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:35,284
because the best version of "me"

149
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:38,079
is just as much about my effect
on the world around me

150
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,833
as it is about my own egocentric self-image.

151
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,752
I really meant that much to you guys?

152
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:45,962
Of course you did.

153
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,589
Now let's get you back on that scale, dorkus!

154
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:56,764
Oh, good, you're back.
I had Janet make some food for the trip.

155
00:06:56,806 --> 00:06:57,849
Twizzlers for Jason.

156
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,142
Shrimp for Eleanor.

157
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:01,936
Chidi, hard-boiled eggs.

158
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:06,190
And for Tahani, Lord Vivian's
Vinegar-Drenched Cuttlefish Crisps.

159
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:08,276
Oh, my favourite savoury dessert!

160
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,611
Oh, un-pickled...

161
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:12,113
No, thank you.

162
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:14,532
Chidi? Ready to try again?

163
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:16,409
Yeah, all right.

164
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:21,664
Yeah!

165
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:32,675
Dope!

166
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,472
Ugh!

167
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:40,182
Chidi got in my head!

168
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:44,729
It's just that thing Chidi said
about previous versions of myself

169
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,814
it's screwing me up, but I can fix it.

170
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,151
Phew!

171
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:52,695
I stole this from your house
the first night we were here.

172
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:55,156
OK. Should be the best version of myself now.

173
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,452
Urgh! Come on, scale! Be cool!

174
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:00,703
Guys, we're just not ready.

175
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:02,663
I think we should regroup,
and try again tomorrow—

176
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:03,873
Hang on. I know the answer.

177
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:05,374
I know why I'm not my best self.

178
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:09,921
Do you remember that version of me,
from the tape of us, at Mindy's?

179
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:14,967
Where I was vulnerable
and emotional, and honest?

180
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:19,221
That Eleanor is a better Eleanor
than this one.

181
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:21,682
And that is not an easy thing for me to say.

182
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:24,685
"You're not better than me"
was my yearbook quote.

183
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:28,356
Michael, can you tell us a little bit
about that version?

184
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:31,067
Uh... reboot number 119.

185
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:33,819
All the restaurants were kebab places.

186
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,822
You had a pet lizard, which I made
poop on you all the time.

187
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,825
No, can you tell us more about
Chidi's and my relationship

188
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:40,952
from that version?

189
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:43,496
Right. Sorry.
Well, you got really into ethics

190
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:45,498
and you spent a lot of time together.

191
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:49,710
Once, you handed him a tissue
right before he sneezed

192
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:54,590
and that simple act of anticipating his needs
made him fall for you.

193
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:59,929
One night you took a walk along the lake,
and you had your first kiss

194
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:04,100
which... gross. Kissing is gross.

195
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:07,228
You just mash your food-holes together.

196
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:08,729
It's not for that!

197
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,608
Anyway, it, uh... it just... you know...

198
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,318
bloomed after that.

199
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,571
Look. There are obviously
some undealt-with issues here.

200
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:21,993
I propose that everyone who is "green"
go ahead and board the magic balloon

201
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:23,536
and set out to the Good Place.

202
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:25,329
You know, sort of like an advance team.

203
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:28,290
We'll put our names in, or book a table,
however it works

204
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:31,627
and then we'll send back the magical balloon
for the "red-light people" later on.

205
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,004
It's a perfect plan.

206
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:36,298
No!

207
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,259
It's not working,
it probably thinks I'm Eleanor.

208
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:41,137
It is I, Tahani!

209
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:42,263
Wait! Wait!

210
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,599
I'm not really my best self, guys.

211
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:51,731
Tahani keeps trying to talk to me about
our relationship, but I keep dodging it.

212
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,733
Plus I haven't talked to Janet
about me and her yet.

213
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:57,194
And I haven't talked to Michael
about the band I want us to start

214
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,612
"The Rock and Roll Buddies."

215
00:09:58,654 --> 00:09:59,905
Yes, actually you did.

216
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,532
I said, uh... I wasn't interested.

217
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:05,619
In case you were wondering,
I am by definition the best version of myself

218
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:07,663
because my operating system
is always updating.

219
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:09,623
I'm not sure that's true, Janet.

220
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:12,460
You still haven't talked to Jason
about your romantic baggage.

221
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:15,921
And the three of you
are in some sort of weird love triangle.

222
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:19,133
You don't know what you're talking about.
Also, love isn't a triangle.

223
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:21,093
It's a five-dimensional blob. So...

224
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:23,637
OK, if you're so perfect, step on the scale.
- Fine.

225
00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:28,267
- Ooh! I think I broke it.
- No!

226
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,727
My beautiful balloon scale!

227
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:30,853
It's not yours!

228
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,813
No, no, please, stop fighting!

229
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:35,149
Ah, man. This... this stinks.

230
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:37,526
I'm having this feeling where...
what is it called?

231
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:38,903
You know where you, uh...

232
00:10:38,944 --> 00:10:41,655
you did a thing and you're sad after it?
What...

233
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:42,865
"After-sad"? Is that...

234
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:46,243
No. Gah!
You humans have so many emotions.

235
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:47,703
You only need two -

236
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,580
anger and confusion!

237
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:51,207
Michael, what's going on?

238
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:53,167
The problem isn't any of you.

239
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:54,460
It...

240
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,545
This whole balloon thing is a fake.

241
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:59,882
The truth is, I have no idea
how to get into the Good Place

242
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,092
and I never have.

243
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:05,888
Well, Michael's right.

244
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,809
I'm angry and confused.

245
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:17,024
So, months ago, when you said
you had this whole complicated plan

246
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,984
for getting us to the Good Place...?
- It was a lie.

247
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:22,988
I assumed if I bought myself some time,
I could figure out a way in.

248
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:26,408
Guys, I tried a billion different ways.

249
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,746
Not an exaggeration - I actually tried
one billion and 12 different plans

250
00:11:30,788 --> 00:11:36,127
but the only way into the Good Place
is by being a good person on Earth.

251
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:39,296
This is unforgivable. How many times
can you betray us?

252
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:41,298
I'm sorry. I really am.

253
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,926
Because while I was searching
for a way to get in

254
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,470
I was also taking your ethics classes

255
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,764
learning why it was bad to lie.

256
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:51,851
So not only did I fail at getting us
into the Good Place

257
00:11:51,892 --> 00:11:54,603
I also learned the "error of my ways."

258
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:58,065
Real rock bottom for a demon, I'll tell ya.

259
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:01,152
So... how did you know
that I would doubt myself

260
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:02,987
and make the scale turn red?

261
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:04,697
I mean, at the risk of seeming blunt

262
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:08,576
I'm a puppet master
and you have long been my puppets.

263
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:10,327
But this was not torture!

264
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:13,789
I... I was stalling,
so I could keep searching for a way in.

265
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:16,917
I would have been happy if you were to live
in this Neighbourhood forever

266
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,254
but then Shawn came and... and...
and just ruined the whole thing.

267
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,882
So, what happens now?

268
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:25,843
Shawn will eventually figure out
you're not at Mindy's.

269
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:31,098
And he'll realize that someone on the inside
was helping you.

270
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:34,977
So, you'll go to the real Bad Place forever,
and I will be...

271
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:36,020
be retired.

272
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:37,062
You're... you're mad at me.

273
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:38,814
I'm not mad.

274
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,442
I'm just disappointed.

275
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:44,195
Aw, come on, everyone knows that's worse.

276
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:48,532
So, this really is the end.
Completely out of options, are we?

277
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:51,493
Not completely out of options.

278
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:57,249
We can do what the Shellstrops
have always done, when the chips are down

279
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,753
ignore our problems and drink heavily.

280
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:02,504
Janet!

281
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:05,216
A million bottles
of your finest booze, please.

282
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:08,719
You alright?

283
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:14,099
Kinda. I asked Michael if I could pop
the giant balloon

284
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,267
and he said no.

285
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:18,187
Then I asked if I could suck
the helium out of it

286
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:20,814
to make my voice sound funny
so it cheers everyone up...

287
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:24,068
and he just kind of sighed and walked away

288
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:27,154
so I guess that one is still on the table.

289
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,033
Are you and me cool?

290
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:32,368
Not exactly.

291
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:37,164
I think perhaps, given everything,
it's best we end our relationship.

292
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:42,378
It's probably about time I stopped relying
on others for my sense of self-worth

293
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,671
or happiness.

294
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:48,217
You know, my whole life,
whenever I encountered any obstacles

295
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,885
I would simply say

296
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:52,263
"I would like to speak to your manager."

297
00:13:53,013 --> 00:13:55,224
But in our relationship, there is no manager.

298
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:59,353
There is no one
who can fix this for me, except me.

299
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,817
My mum was a manager at a pet store.
Does that help?

300
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,778
No, and please don't launch
into one of your long stories.

301
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,196
She got fired
- No, Jason...

302
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:11,198
after I robbed the pet store
- Please, please, please, please, Jason.

303
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,158
where she worked. We robbed it together.
- No, no, no, no, no. Please, stop.

304
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,036
Long story short, it was all a dream.

305
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:21,208
Thank you, Jason, for making this moment
a little easier, for me.

306
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,130
Dude, here's where I'm at -

307
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,464
feelings are stupid.

308
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:29,758
Yeah. Who needs them?

309
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,139
But, uh... in case feelings aren't stupid,
and, in the case that we are

310
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,100
eternally doomed, I thought
it might be worth mentioning that I do...

311
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,478
have feelings for you.

312
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,731
And I... I know you don't feel the same way.

313
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:45,816
And although that fills me with...

314
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:49,361
anger and confusion...

315
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,572
Wow, Michael was right on the money.

316
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:54,742
I just wanted you to know the truth.

317
00:14:56,493 --> 00:14:58,412
You are... I mean...

318
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:00,914
- No, no, don't say anything. Don't. Don't.
- I want to, I want to.

319
00:15:00,956 --> 00:15:01,915
I want to.

320
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,334
Here's the thing about me.

321
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,254
You know the sound that a fork makes
in the garbage disposal?

322
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,968
That's the sound that my brain makes,
all the time.

323
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,678
It's just this constant grinding.

324
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,682
About things I'm afraid of,
or things that I want

325
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:23,062
or want to want, or want to want to...

326
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:25,230
Is it grinding in there right now, bud?
- Yep.

327
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:28,442
But the... the point is, the circumstances
under which we met

328
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:33,781
are completely insane, and that just makes
the grinding harder.

329
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:36,617
I just wish we'd met the way
normal people meet

330
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:40,454
like at a philosophy conference, or after one
of my philosophy lectures...

331
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:42,706
or... or you came knocking

332
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:45,584
on my office door asking for help
with philosophy.

333
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,503
Is that how you think people meet?

334
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:50,339
I don't know how normal people meet.

335
00:15:53,634 --> 00:15:55,135
It's not that I couldn't love you.

336
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,054
You're amazing

337
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:57,971
and...

338
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:00,015
fearless, and...

339
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:02,726
and clearly...

340
00:16:04,686 --> 00:16:06,980
symmetrical.

341
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,483
You're such a nerd.

342
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:12,569
Attention, everyone!

343
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,367
We may not know exactly which version
of ourselves was technically our "best self"

344
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:19,410
but you know what?

345
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,453
I like who we are right now.

346
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:23,455
To this version of us.

347
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,499
To the good people we've all become.

348
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:26,875
Oh, and to Eleanor!

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,210
Our unofficial leader.

350
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:31,922
You pack a lot of heart and grit into that
diminutive frame.

351
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:34,633
Like a scrappy little auto-mechanic.

352
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,719
That's the nicest thing you've ever said
to me, babe, and I'll take it.

353
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:39,888
And to Janet! The best robot...

354
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,056
Not a robot.
- Girl...

355
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:42,891
Not a girl.
- And straight-up hottie...

356
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,184
I am attractive, yes.

357
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:46,311
any of us could have ever asked for.

358
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:47,312
Thanks, guys.

359
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,982
Because of the way
we were conceived of and created

360
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:52,609
Janets don't typically give speeches.

361
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:56,363
Oh, she's done.
She's not gonna give a speech.

362
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:57,281
Oh.
- OK. Cool.

363
00:16:57,322 --> 00:16:59,408
Oh, one more toast! To Michael!

364
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:00,659
Michael!

365
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,706
Who is easily the best version of himself

366
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:06,999
granted the bar was low.

367
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,667
Mm-hmm.
- He is a demon.

368
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:09,668
- Mm...
- But...

369
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,171
he made a mistake and admitted he was wrong

370
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:15,466
which makes him better than 90%
of all humans.

371
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:17,426
And you know what?
It wasn't really Michael's fault.

372
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:20,387
We weren't getting
into the Good Place anyway.

373
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,763
I mean, look at us -

374
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:23,640
a self-obsessed socialite

375
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:25,517
a ridiculous giraffe

376
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,563
an absurd British aristocrat,
a narcissistic attention-seeker—

377
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:30,939
Are these all me?
- Yes.

378
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:33,108
I was gonna do eight for you,
and one for everyone else.

379
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,194
The point is, Michael...

380
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:36,320
we forgive you.

381
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:39,740
I mean, at least you tried to find a way
to the Good Place.

382
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:42,117
And that's the greatest thing someone can do

383
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:43,744
just try your best.

384
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:50,626
So, we hereby name you
an "honourary human"

385
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:56,048
and we would like to present you
with this Human Starter Kit.

386
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,594
Car keys! So I can lose them and say,
"Has anyone seen my car keys?"

387
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:03,889
Oh, and then I can do that, you know,
that thing where you... you...

388
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:04,973
Thank you!

389
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:09,645
And Band-Aids,
for your stupid fragile bodies.

390
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:13,899
Oh, and look at this - a stress ball
with a dumb corporate logo?

391
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:16,485
Oh, I can't wait to keep finding this

392
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,362
and then almost throw it away, and then think

393
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:20,113
"No, I'll... I'll use it!"

394
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,408
Oh... guys.

395
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:27,871
A Doctor Oz diet book,
because you're all such suckers.

396
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:31,917
This is all garbage
that I have no real use for.

397
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:34,253
That's right. Welcome to being human, buddy.

398
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:35,379
To Michael.

399
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,552
♪ I do my makeup in somebody else's car ♪

400
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,602
♪ We order different drinks
at the same bars... ♪

401
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:05,951
♪ Unforgettable
That's what you are ♪

402
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,205
♪ Unforgettable... ♪

403
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:11,665
- You don't remember?
- No!

404
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:13,208
No, of course you don't.

405
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,501
Oh, that's mean.

406
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:17,212
That was version one.

407
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:19,590
Michael...

408
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:21,633
there's a message coming in from Shawn.

409
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:24,177
"Finish shutting everything down."

410
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,430
"Sending train first thing tomorrow."

411
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:30,475
"Humans will be captured and tortured soup."

412
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:32,936
"Sorry, autocorrect."

413
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,146
"Soon."

414
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:37,649
"Although weirdly I did just finish turning
someone into soup."

415
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,234
"So random."

416
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:40,444
"OK, bye."

417
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,408
What do you guys think the Bad Place
is going to be, for you?

418
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,910
I'll probably go to a Skrillex concert

419
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,538
and I'll be waiting for the bass drop.

420
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:53,290
And it...
