1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,050
See all the spikes?

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,190
So two things. One, it's poisonous.
And two, it would hurt.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,220
The parks department has so many programs.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,920
Jerry's in charge of our preteen nature hikes.

5
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,660
For a while, it was a teenage nature hike.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,710
But then we changed it
because a girl got pregnant.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,770
Look what we have here.
Country honeysuckle,

8
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,570
Yeah, take a look at that.

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,600
It's pretty and it smells good.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,970
Mm, smells great.
- Yeah, it's really nice.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,530
Oh, that's bitter. Leslie, you don't eat it.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,750
Why did you let me eat that?
I never told you to eat that.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,730
Oh, god. Leslie, the animals know you
don't eat the country honeysuckle.

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,640
I'm not an animal. My tongue is
swelling up. No,no, don't touch—

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,470
okay, now you'll have to throw that away.

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,810
Let's not scare the kids. Okay.

17
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,730
Well, there we go then. So let's show 'em
what other plants we could eat, jerry.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,420
But I have to say it's a very sweet aftertaste though.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,230
So I have a piece of good news.

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,040
I've invited a reporter to come do
an article about the pit behind your house.

21
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,380
She writes for the pawnee journal, which is kind
of like our town's washington post.

22
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,840
That sounds really good.

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,500
Thank you, ann. It is a classic strategy.

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,010
The press is a weapon, and you can
use it to kill people or to feed people.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,740
You know, the beginning of
projects are very vulnerable.

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,870
'cause the momentum of that can
kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die.

27
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:57,480
I mean,I'm sure you remember
the tucker park graffiti removal project.

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,240
The tucker parker graffiti removal
project was a great idea

29
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,790
that just ran out of steam.

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,390
We had removed five cartoon
penises—not even 10%--

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,500
when we were shut down
due to lack of funding.

32
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,770
To this day,I am haunted by
those remaining penises.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,050
One penis in particular.

34
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,760
Now when the reporter gets here, it is vital

35
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,760
that we all follow my rules about
how to deal with the media.

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,920
Rule number one: Stay on message.

37
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,970
This is key. All we need to talk about is the pit,

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,460
and the fact that we're
gonna turn it into a park.

39
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,890
And that's it. Okay?

40
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,840
Number two: What?

41
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,290
Stay on message again?
Yes, it's that important.

42
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,880
It's one and two. Stay on message
and stay on message. Right?

43
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,540
Stay on what, ann?

44
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,720
Message. Great.

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,220
Leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week,

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,180
which is really impressive.

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,340
I mean until now, my only experience with
government was trying to get a recycling bin.

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,270
Wait. Did I ever get it?

49
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,090
Bye, leslie. Bye, ann.

50
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,630
Hey, mark. Yeah.

51
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,730
Buy you a cup of coffee?

52
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:15,290
This is jj's diner, the unofficial meeting
place of pawnee's political elite.

53
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,960
The people who eat here basically run this town.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,950
So listen,I was hoping maybe I could pick your
brain about how to deal with the media.

55
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,470
It's my first interview.

56
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,360
What about that thing you did for
the middle school newspaper last year?

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,220
Oh, no. I don't count that.

58
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,620
That was a smear job.

59
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,940
So I put together some discussion topics.
Can I run them by you?

60
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,980
Okay.

61
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,950
What do you think her opening gambit
is gonna be? What is she gonna ask me first?

62
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,490
How you spell your name. Of course.

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,740
Because of the silent K.
You're so smart. Yeah.

64
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,590
Okay, now should I give her a tour of the building?
How many discussion questions do you have there?

65
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,510
Uh,30.

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,380
You're insane. You're insane.

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,350
Mark and I made love once.
And it was very intense.

68
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,490
Hi,I'm looking for leslie knope. Okay.

69
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,590
Oh, my ears are ringing.

70
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,340
I'm leslie knope. I'm the deputy
director of parks and recreation.

71
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,460
Shauna. Malwae-tweep.
Yes,I am familiar with your work.

72
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,030
I've read everything you've ever written.

73
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,170
You did an amazing in-depth article on
the raccoon problem here in pawnee.

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,740
Who left the door open? No! No! No!

75
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,580
And I agree with you. They are nature's bandits.

76
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,390
Thanks. I was happy with that line.

77
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,950
So,uh, can I give you a quick tour before we
get started? I've been here before. A few times.

78
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,620
Quick tour? Okay.

79
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:54,620
There are three murals here in the hall.
And this is called "the trial of chief wamapo."

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:01,260
And he was convicted
of crimes against the soldiers.

81
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,700
I am always amazed at his... quiet dignity.

82
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,790
Right before he's killed by a cannonball.

83
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,850
I'm surprised no one's complained
about this. Oh, tons of people have.

84
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,930
Yeah, we get letters every day.

85
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,240
This is ron swanson, our boss. Ron, this is the
reporter I was telling you about. No comment.

86
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,810
About what?

87
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,040
Hey haverford, maybe one day you'll figure
out how to spell a three-letter word.

88
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,190
Pssh, come on, ron.

89
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,870
I play a lot of online scrabble with
my boss, ron swanson, and oh, my god,

90
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,690
that guy is the best.

91
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,500
He beats me every time. He kills me. He's awesome.

92
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,980
I can't beat him. I should just close my account.

93
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,820
Well,shauna, this is our crack team. Hi, everyone.

94
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,260
Tom haverford. Boy genius.

95
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,500
Smooth like milk chocolate.
That's a weird way to describe me.

96
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,320
April ludgate,19. Cool enough to be invited
anywhere and chooses to be here.

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,770
And finally, we've got ann perkins and andy dwyer.

98
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,930
They're the real heroes of this story.

99
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,150
Ann was the citizen who
brought the pit to our attention.

100
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,390
And andy is the citizen who fell in it.

101
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,140
Great. It's cool if I record this, right?

102
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,400
Yeah. Good.

103
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,470
That way it's verbatim.

104
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,470
So leslie, you're in charge of the committee.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,580
I'm sorry. It'S... it's actually called
a subcommittee, not a committee, so.

106
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Um, we can do all this on tape.

107
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,200
Right. Sorry. Sure we can.

108
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,210
And this is where you meet generally?

109
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,220
Really? We meet at a bunch of different
places. We don't always meet here.

110
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,210
So I didn't quite know How to answer that.

111
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:49,690
the rest of your team some questions and
then we will come back to you later?

112
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,110
Okay, great. That's good.
Because these are the real heroes.

113
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,070
I'm gonna be in my office.

114
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,530
So andy, tell me about the
night you fell into the pit.

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,830
Oh, yeah. That's actually a great story.

116
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,480
Um,I just finished up a gig
with my band three skin,

117
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,830
formerly foreskin, but our bassist
left for personal reasons.

118
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,830
And I was taking the shortcut home,
and I thought I saw a toaster lying in the pit.

119
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,330
And I was like,"maybe I should get that."

120
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,470
And I fell in and broke my legs. Such a tragedy.

121
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,850
Why would you want a toaster that's
lying at the bottom of the pit?

122
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,650
I don't know. I was pretty wasted.

123
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,840
Wait— You were drunk? Oh, yeah. Totally.

124
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,500
You knew that. I didn't know that, no.
You should've told me,

125
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,310
because we gave you anesthesia at the hospital.

126
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,810
I was probably not thinking 'cause I had
two broken femurs and I was,like, blackout drunk.

127
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,950
Andy,I just—I can't— I can't believe
I'm just finding this out right now.

128
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,670
Oh, like you're perfect. You're on
the pill. You drink all the time.

129
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,560
You're allowed to do that. Stay on message.

130
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,100
Thank you so much for bringing
that up in front of a reporter.

131
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,250
Leslie, it's not that bad, right?

132
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,650
I mean, why don't we just go back in
there and talk about the park?

133
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,190
Oh, ann. You're so sweet
and innocent and pretty.

134
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,110
The press are like sharks, and you guys just
dumped a bucket of chum in the water.

135
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,280
Hey,I just got your 15 texts.

136
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,780
Listen. Thank you for coming.
I... I tried to stay on message.

137
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,390
But then, ann and andy sandbagged me.

138
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,795
Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit. And it
turns out that ann is on birth control pills.

139
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:30,570
Shauna is in the conference room,

140
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,030
and she's writing a really bad article
and it's gonna destroy us all.

141
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,640
Please fix it.

142
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,130
April. Let me ask you something.

143
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,520
Do you think I'm in the top five best-looking
indian guys in pawnee? No.

144
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,870
Who do you think's got me beat? That guy that
teaches city planning? Tommy boy.

145
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,850
Let me tell you something, tom.
You suck at scrabble.

146
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,550
I know. You're destroying me.

147
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,490
You're worse than my ex-wife,
and she's terrible at scrabble.

148
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,090
And she's a bitch.

149
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,710
Look out, man. I'm gonna get one of these
days. I'm practicing. Yeah,I doubt that.

150
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,720
Her name is tammy swanson
and she's a serious bitch.

151
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,620
Hey, leslie. Um,I have to go. Let's do the
interview tomorrow morning at the pit.

152
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,700
Yeah. Perfect. Great. I'll have
a photographer meet us there.

153
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,910
Okay. Great. See you then.

154
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,090
Disaster averted.

155
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,180
That was easy. Okay.

156
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,010
Can we go in your car? Absolutely.

157
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,850
All right. 'Cause I hate driving.

158
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,440
There's a beautiful view from over there.

159
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,730
This is a great place to take
a shot. Over there as well, so.

160
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,500
I think you're fine.

161
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,330
Hi!

162
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,140
Hi. Sorry I'm late. Oh, no problem.

163
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,440
Do you live near mark? No, not at all.

164
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,520
So he gave you a ride somehow? Yeah.

165
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,920
You know, do you have a pen?

166
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,450
'Cause I don't— No, sorry.

167
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,350
Michael, do you have any paper
I could borrow? I might, yeah.

168
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,630
I don't mean to complain, but I think
shauna is being a little unprofessional.

169
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,930
She got here 15 minutes late.

170
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,390
She's wearing the same
dress she wore yesterday.

171
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,890
And she had to get a ride from...

172
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,770
So how big is this lot?

173
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,290
Leslie, how big— What?

174
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,690
How big is the lot? How big is what?

175
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,860
The lot. I don't know. You tell me. How big is the lot?

176
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,740
100 or something. Give or take 100. I don't know.

177
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,650
100 what? I don't know, shauna.
Malwae-tweep. I don't know.

178
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,260
I don't— I guess I don't know anything.

179
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,470
Are you okay? I have to get
something from my car.

180
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,420
What are you doing?
Kicking ron's butt at scrabble.

181
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,390
Just played "lexicons" for a billion points.

182
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,370
No,no,no,no, no. What?

183
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,000
I was letting him win, dumbass.

184
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,650
Whatever.

185
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,490
Oh, come on. "Lateral?"
"Communal?"Zonal?"

186
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,650
You dropped a z in there? April.

187
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,590
So when did you start
at the parks department?

188
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,120
Well,uh, it was a few years ago.

189
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,880
My mother got me the job.

190
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,230
I was qualified.
It's not like it was nepotism.

191
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,160
Crap on a stick.
Okay,technically,yes, it was nepotism.

192
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,290
But—oh, my god. Sorry.

193
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,770
It's not you. I just—I'm exhausted.
I got,like, zero sleep last night.

194
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,880
Hey, leslie. You're home.

195
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,930
Yeah,I'm home. I was doing an interview
at the pit, and it was going really well.

196
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,560
In fact, it was going perfect.

197
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,270
But I decided to leave in the middle of it 'cause
I figured I nailed it so why push it, right?

198
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,780
Yeah. Can I come in?

199
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,900
Uh, sure. Great. Come on in.

200
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,310
So how'd it go? She didn't ask
about andy being drunk, did she? Uh, no.

201
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,910
No, just your kind of standard questions.

202
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,300
There was one annoying thing.

203
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,320
She and mark had sex with each other.

204
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,790
You're kidding. I wish I was,
but I'm not. They did it.

205
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,880
Shauna malwae-tweep and mark brendanawicz
had sex with each other last night.

206
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,140
Who had sex? That guy mark and the reporter.

207
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,530
Called it. I called that.

208
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,320
Remember that? Yeah.

209
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,350
He did, actually. He totally called that.

210
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,720
Why do men have to behave like this?
Why can't they be professionals?

211
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Men are dogs. You know, maybe— maybe
they really like each other.

212
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,990
he doesn't like her.

213
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,530
He was probably thinking with the head of his weiner
instead of the head of his brain. Oh, god. Andy, come on.

214
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,280
Men do that. It's disgusting.

215
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,720
Well,I should go talk to him.

216
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,300
Make sure that he didn't say
anything to hurt the project. Yeah.

217
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,540
Definitely you should talk to him. Yeah.

218
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,530
Good idea, ann. I bet he didn't use a condom.

219
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,190
Andy, god!

220
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,430
Hello, mark. May I come into your office?

221
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,240
I need to speak with you
about something very sensitive.

222
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,050
Something's come to my attention
that requires your attention.

223
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,380
It has come to my attention that you
had sex with ms. Malwae-tweep.

224
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,840
Uh, that's personal.

225
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,600
It's unethical and it's irresponsible
for a public servant to have sex

226
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,480
with a member of the press corps.

227
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,990
Especially when you have sex with someone
who is so skanky. I mean, have sex with her? I di—

228
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,040
I'm gonna say something.
I don't want you to take it the wrong way.

229
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,670
But you're being a huge dork.

230
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,340
Well,I can't allow that kind of behavior from
someone serving on my subcommittee.

231
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,590
Well then I resign from your subcommittee.

232
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,950
Shauna malwae-tweep.

233
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,400
Hi, this is deputy director of
parks and recreation— Leslie?

234
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,730
Yes, hi. Hi.

235
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,330
I accidentally ate an old burrito. What?

236
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:27,560
I was acting strange at the pit and the
reason is because I had food poisoning...

237
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,430
from an old burrito.

238
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:35,380
So... I was hoping we could
have a do-over interview.

239
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,040
Maybe over lunch. I'm buying.

240
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,470
Yeah,I guess I'm free.
I'm assuming not mexican.

241
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:46,660
Oh.

242
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,910
Yeah, well it wasn't a mexican burrito.

243
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,430
Are you sure that's the best
thing for you right now?

244
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,530
Oh, it's the best thing on the menu.

245
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,140
So look,I feel like I may have gone
a little off message at the pit.

246
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,030
Yeah, you seemed a little weird.
Well,I wouldn't say weird. It's just,

247
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,260
we're trying to turn a dangerous
eyesore into a beautiful community park

248
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,870
and a positive article could go a long
way towards making that happen.

249
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,790
Great. So what do you think the odds are
that this park is actually gonna get made?

250
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,690
Can I say over 100%?

251
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,730
Because I would be lying if I said less.

252
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,890
You seem a lot more confident than some
of the other people I've spoken to.

253
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,820
Can I read you some of these quotes?

254
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,680
Be my guest.
"The sullivan street pit is always going to be a pit."

255
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,220
Well, until it turns into a park.

256
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,570
Yes,I agree.

257
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,790
"Hey, you should write an article on unicorns, because
they're more likely to exist than this park."

258
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,180
Oh, really? Tell that to a 14-year-old girl.

259
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,680
"You should write an article on the pope getting married,
because that's more likely to happen than this park."

260
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,930
There are some countries
where the pope can be married.

261
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,290
"You should write an article on talking monkeys."
Really? Have you seen the wizard of oz?

262
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,380
"You should write an article about
leprechauns. Leprechauns exist.

263
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,250
"You should write an article about
the sun falling out of the sky."

264
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,640
Why would you write an article about that?
That's— This one is just "no."

265
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,250
Um,"this park is never, ever,
ever, ever going to happen."

266
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,580
Might I ask who said that?
Uh, mark brendanawicz.

267
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,540
Yeah. Hey.

268
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,740
Hi. Can I talk to you for a second?

269
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,910
Yeah, what's up?

270
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,400
Uh, you and I need to find
a way to fix this reporter thing.

271
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,150
Why is this a big deal to anybody?

272
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,630
Well apparently, the reporter is gonna
print everything you said to her.

273
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,110
But I didn't say anything to her.

274
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,250
"The park is never, ever,
ever, ever getting built?"

275
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,240
But that stuff was off the record.

276
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,050
Did you say it was off the record?

277
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,340
Do you have to say it's
off the record? Oh, my god.

278
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,880
Hey. Thank you so much for meeting us.

279
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,610
Sure. Hey, mark. Hey.

280
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:17,900
Uh... I heard that you were gonna print some
of that stuff that I said in private about the park.

281
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,580
Oh, yeah. My editor loves it.

282
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,540
You know we'd really appreciate
it if you didn't print that stuff

283
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,550
'cause we're trying to build
this park— I don't understand.

284
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,740
You did say it, right?

285
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,150
Technically. Technically?

286
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,680
Well, you know,

287
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,130
you got up because you had to write
the article and I said,"come on, stay in bed.

288
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,560
That park is never,ever, ever gonna get made."

289
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,850
Right. And then I came back to bed.

290
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,530
Yeah, but the important part of
what I said was "stay in bed."

291
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,230
You know,I would've said anything at that point
if I thought it would make you stay in bed.

292
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:57,230
Okay, well since we're, you know,
romantically involved,I won't print any of it.

293
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,070
Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. You're welcome.

294
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,010
You know... I wouldn't say romantically involved.

295
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,030
You know, going forward. Oh, my god.

296
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,180
What?

297
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,960
Ron swanson Tom.

298
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,190
Ron,I don't know what to tell you, man.

299
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,630
April got on my computer.

300
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,820
Password was saved. She played
a couple of scrabble words. It wasn't me.

301
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,180
I don't even know what lexicons are.
I thought that was a luxury automobile.

302
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,180
You're the word king.
She was probably cheating.

303
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,610
I knew that couldn't have been you.
You don't have the vocabulary.

304
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,440
I know. You can't even spell vocabulary.

305
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,680
Uh, yeah. V-o-g-x—ugh!

306
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,580
Was that right? No.

307
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,630
We're cool.

308
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,100
I'm not an idiot. I know tom has been
losing to me on purpose. But I like tom.

309
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,750
He doesn't do a lot of work around here.

310
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,220
He shows zero initiative. He's not a team player.

311
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,780
He's never one to go that extra mile.

312
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,010
Tom is exactly what I'm looking
for in a government employee.

313
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,780
Hey, you busy?

314
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,980
Well I'm writing an op-ed piece about media ethics
for the pawnee journal, so yeah,I'm a little busy.

315
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,390
I wanted to apologize to you.

316
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,790
Really? Yeah.

317
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,170
I never should've done anything with that reporter.
Whoa! You nailed malwae-tweep? Nice.

318
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,170
Yes, but... I'm not gonna do it again.

319
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,150
It's over. So she's available.

320
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,960
I really did think that that stuff
that I said was off the record.

321
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,320
But you were right, and I should've listened to you.

322
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,900
I tried to get her to pull some of those
quotes and things got a little dicey.

323
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,310
Well,I appreciate you trying.

324
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,730
Would you like to be reinstated
onto our subcommittee?

325
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,500
Absolutely. You'll have my answer within the month.

326
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,280
Mark, can I ask you a question?

327
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,100
You didn't really believe it when you said that
the park was never gonna get made, right?

328
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,680
Park's gonna get done.

329
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,790
Welcome back, subcommittee
member mark brendanawicz.

330
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,370
Thank.

331
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,840
Thank you. Thank you.

332
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,960
Thank you. Thanks,a lot. Thank you a lot.

333
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,500
Oh,man, that dude has
stuck it in some crazy chicks.

334
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,790
Well, the article came out,
and it was a mixed bag.

335
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,400
"An abandoned lot on sullivan street
has been proposed as the site of a new park."

336
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,610
That part's good. I think we stayed
on message for that part.

337
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:56,790
And then it gets a little unpleasant,
da-da-da, pretty drunk. Ann's on the pill.

338
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,690
I didn't throw up,I spit up.

339
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,190
Jj's diner gets a nice mention.

340
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,040
Oh, and right here. At the end.
She writes, and I quote,

341
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,910
"we'll see."

342
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,910
Ends on a hopeful note.
