Finally. Nice work. Oh, yeah.

51
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,720
There used to be this huge speed Bump in the center of town.

52
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:54,830
It we. So I decided I wanted To do something about it.

53
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:57,245
And I got it lowered twonches.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,330
Apparently what I can achieve In government Can literally be measured.

55
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,015
hey, dr. Harris.

56
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,980

58
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,900
I think there's gonna be A good turnout At andy's show tonight.

59
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:13,890
He wrote this new song About what happened to him Calledthe pit.

60
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:16,905
It's one of those rare songs That rocks really hard...

61
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,490
And also informs people about A small public works project.

62
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,095
guess andy's doing well.

63
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,630
yeah, he's A little shaky still, But that's to be expected.

64
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:26,775
well, not really.

65
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,890
If he had his cast Removed two weeks ago, The Have atrophied so much.

66
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:32,335
I'm sorry, two weeks ago?

67
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,575
it's when they Were scheduled to come off.

68
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,580
but he told me that You told him he should wait.

69
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:38,305
no, he rescheduled.

70
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,340
He said it was personal, That he would explain later, But then he never explained.

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,740
I have waited on him Hand and foot

72
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,325
For two months.

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,020

74
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,410

75
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:56,170

The band has had a few Different nameover the years.

79
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:06,540
When it started we were Teddy bear suicide,

80
00:04:06,575 --> 00:04:09,235
But then we changed it To mouse rat.

81
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,330
Then we were god hates figs. The department of homeland Obscurity.

82
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:15,890
Flames for flames. Muscle confusion.

83
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,555
Nothing rhymes with orange.

84
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,510
Uh, then Everything rhymes with orange.

85
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:21,465
Punchface champions. Rad wagon.

86
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,135
Puppy pendulum. Possum pendulum. Penis pendulum.

87
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,710
Hand rail suicide. Angel snack. Just the tip. Three skin.

88
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,345
Uh, jet black pope.

89
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,215
We went back to mouse rat. And now we are Scarecrow boat.

90
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,875
God, when I hear myself Say scarecrow boat Out loud,I kind of hate it.

91
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,465
now, you know That we're gonna be building A park in a residential lot,

92
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,520
So of course we're gonna have To get the zoning codes approved And amended by our city council.

93
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,940
what kind of movies Do you like? huh?

94
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:53,215

great.

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,420
So I brought Some pictures of the lot, And you can tell that The houses are very close to it.

98
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,235
How difficult is Rezoning in your town?

99
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,260
Could you go into detail A little bit about that? sure. Great.

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,800
it's refreshing To be with someone Who likes talking about Government issues.

101
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:17,410
most of the women I go out with find it boring.

102
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,210
well, you know, You veo have zoning codes, Or else the whole thing Could be chaos.

103
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,460

104
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:25,200

00:05:38,587 --> 00:05:41,210
Not my kids, 'Cause they're grown up. But...

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,445
It was tough on their kids.

111
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,600
I shouldn't bring up my divorce On the first date.

112
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,750
