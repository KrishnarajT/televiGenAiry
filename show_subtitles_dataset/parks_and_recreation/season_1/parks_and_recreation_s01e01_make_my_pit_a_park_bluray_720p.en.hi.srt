00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,260
Hello.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,560
My name is leslie knope, and I work for
the parks and recreation department.

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,020
Can I ask you a few questions?

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,120
Would you say that you are
enjoying yourself and having fun,

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,280
having a moderate amount of fun and somewhat
enjoying yourself, or having no fun and no enjoyment?

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,590
I'm gonna put "a lot of fun.

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,260
" Ms. Knope! There's a
drunk stuck in the slide.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,980
Sir, this—this is
a children's slide.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,870
You're not allowed to sleep in here.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,070
You know, when I first tell people that I work
in the government, they say,"oh, the government.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,100
The government stinks. The
lines are too long at the dmv.

12
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,000
" But now things have changed.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,730
People need our help.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,170
And it feels good to be needed.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,290
- Could you put your arms to your side?

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,060
- And that might help you slide down a little easier?

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,030
Do you want to come this way?

18
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,410
- Okay, we're gonna need you to get out.
- Can you please go away?

19
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,670
Get out of the slide.

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,780
- Okay? You're... Here we go!
- Can you please go away?

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,190
Okay, wake up.Here we
go. Out of the slide.

22
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,740
You know, government isn't
just a boys' club anymore.

23
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,230
Women are everyw re.

24
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,790
It's a great time to
be a woman in politics.

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,880
Hillary clinton. Sarah
palin.Me. Nancy pelosi.

26
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,510
We did it!

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,640
You know,I— I like to tell people, you know,"get on
board and buckle up,"bause my ride'sgonna be a big one.

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,600
If "andyou get motion sickness,"you
know, put your head between your knees

29
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,340
'cause leslie knope's
stopping for no one.

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,060
Tonight is our next monthly
community outreach public forum.

34
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,890
And that is tonight.

35
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,390
- That is tonight.
- Right.

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,130
Leslie will be running it.

37
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,670
And we need one more.

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,750
Who wants in?

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,440
Tom.

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,450
Fine.

41
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,340
This is a great thing
for you guys to see.

42
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,090
This is where the rubber of government
meets the road of actual human beings.

43
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,790
When I go through these
doors,I need to be on.

44
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,750
Like the white house press secretary.

45
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,760
Are you ready?

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,190
- Yeah.
- Okay.

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,760
Here we go.

48
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,830
It's locked.

49
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,530
Okay.

50
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,320
Here we go.

51
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,820
Thank you so much for
coming. What an amazing turnout.

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,890
My name is leslie knope.

53
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,080
I am the deputy director of the
parks and recreation department,

54
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,670
and tonight we're gonna be
taking some of your questions as—

55
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,700
hello?

56
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,970
We're having a meeting in here.

57
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,580
Does anybody have any
questions about permits?

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,840
So take two.

59
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm leslie knope, and with me is
department member tom haverford.

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,130
We are here to answer any
and all of your questions.

61
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,640
So fire away.

62
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,220
Well, it's a great day,because,uh, last
month they put me in jail.

63
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,460
That's right.

64
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,670
The,uh, the head of the police
is a ninth-degree mason.

65
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,910
But the music is so loud.

66
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,650
Stop the graffiti,please. Please.

67
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,180
I don't like obscenities ju— just
as much as you don't like them.

68
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,790
No, it drives me crazy.I have kids.

69
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,230
hey, My And the guy's,"you My, You Head.

70
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,530
" These people are members of a
community that care about where they live,

71
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,710
so what I hear when I'm being yelled
at is people caring loudly at me.

72
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,780
Now,I have a few t ngs I want
to say about laura linney.

73
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,910
Thank you so much, barry.

74
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,420
Always great to have you here.

75
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,510
Anyone else who would
like to contribute—

76
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,840
I'm ann perkins.

77
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,730
Uh,I'm a nurse, and frankly,I
don't really care for politics.

78
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,390
uh,but, um,I'm— I'm here to talk about
the abandoned lot on sullivan street.

79
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,180
Excellent. That sounds like a
good idea. Tell us about that.

80
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,670
No, it's a problem.

81
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,400
It almost killed my boyfriend.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,670
Yeah.

83
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,680
There's a lot nearby my house, and a
developer dug out a basement for some condos,

84
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,330
and then they went bankrupt.

85
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,270
So there's just this giant pit, and
it's been there for almost a year.

86
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,970
12 months,yes. Go on.

87
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,730
Yeah,and,um, my boyfriend, who
is a musician— actually,

88
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,650
I support him— but anyway, he
fell in and broke both his legs.

89
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,020
Ann, let me speak with you for a minute.

90
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,970
So your boyfriend fell
down into this pit, right?

91
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,260
Yes.

92
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,220
And,um, this guy— is it pretty
serious? Are you guys living together?

93
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,590
Yes.

94
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,050
Uh,I'm sure this must
be really tough for you.

95
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,060
You know, just— this guy— sounds like he
didn't have a lot going on for him to start with,

96
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,190
and now both legs broken. He's just weak.

97
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,510
You have to take care of him.

98
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,440
- You probably feel like
you need to move on.- Why—

99
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,710
what does this— Just become more adventurous
in relationships with your body, just in—

100
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,060
Are you—are you actually
hitting on me right now?

101
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,130
Oh,oh,god, no.

102
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,880
I'm not— I'm not hitting
on you.I'm actually married.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,090
I'm just an open person, and
I like connecting with people.

104
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm, you know, very comfortable
around women, attractive women.

105
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,330
I've spent a lot of time with
them. And I just— I—I don't know.

106
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,550
I feel like we might be taking
up too much of the forum's time.

107
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,030
Maybe we can just exchange numbers.

108
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,610
You know, maybe go away one weekend
and just kind of talk about this.

109
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,570
Look.

110
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,250
I'd love to do it.

111
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,520
The bottom line is I've been trying to get this
thing fixed for months and nobody's done anything,

112
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,840
and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's
government-owned, and you need to do something about it.

113
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,090
Okay.

114
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,100
- I'll do something about it.
- Really?

115
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,200
Yes, we— I
will help you.

116
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,330
Is that a promise?

117
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,170
It's more than a promise.

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,330
It's a pinky promise.

119
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:24,000
I pinky promise all of you that I will
help, and I will go to that location tomorrow

120
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:32,480
and we will fill in that pit, and then when
that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land.

121
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,650
Okay.

122
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Well,I've worked at the parks department for six
years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of.

123
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,590
Recently I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the
sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats.

124
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,020
But this pit— the chance to build
a whole new park from scratch—

125
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,240
this could be my hoover dam.

126
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,040
No, that sounds great.

127
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,350
Um, problem is, anything
over $25 I have to report.

128
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,530
So,um, maybe give my wife a
call and give her the suits,

129
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,850
and then if they don't fit
her, maybe she'll give 'em to me.

130
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,980
Morning.

131
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,800
All right, mr. Mayor.

132
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,900
That sounds good.

133
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,750
I'll see you on saturday for
the,uh, ultimate frisbee game.

134
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,360
Bye.

135
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,070
Leslie, hello.

136
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,660
You were talking to the mayor?

137
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,690
Yep, we was rappin' about some things.

138
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,850
Tom and I work really well together.

139
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,360
We're both outsiders.

140
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,260
I'm a woman, he's A...
oh,I think he's a libyan.

141
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,670
I am from bennettsville, south carolina.

142
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,180
I am what you might call a "redneck.

143
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,440
" Okay, brainstorm.

144
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,980
How do we make this park happen?

145
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,340
Let's go to the city council directly
and ask them to put up the money.

146
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,550
No, parks are not a priority.

147
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,420
I need more firepower.

148
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,050
I need bigger guns.

149
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,770
You know what I need to
do?Form a committee. Right?

150
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,680
Yeah, that could work.

151
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,470
Yeah,'cause committees are power, and
committees make things happen.

152
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,380
Committees are the lifeblood
of our democratic system.

153
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,890
That's really good. Write that down.

154
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,040
Yep.

155
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,250
From time to time, when I think of an eloquent
saying or a phrase,I have tom write it down.

156
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,020
He's collecting them for my memoirs.

157
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,510
Here's leslie's quote from wednesday.

158
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,740
Okay, read it back to me.

159
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,170
"committees cover our
democracy with blood.

160
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,440
" Sounded better when I said it.

161
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,490
It's still good, though.

162
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,220
Okay,I have an idea.

163
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,520
What about bringing mark on board?

164
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,510
- Which mark?
- Which mark?

165
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,810
Mark brendanawicz. Which mark?

166
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,370
Well, if you want something done in this
town, you call mark brendanawicz because,

167
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,320
you know, he's a city planner, but he's
more than that. He's kind of like a fixer.

168
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,860
He fixes things. He's
a smart, capable guy.

169
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,860
He just—he knows where
the bodies are buried.

170
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,380
What's up, brendanawicz?

171
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,210
You crazy old polish person.

172
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,670
City hall is like a locker room, and you gotta
get in there and you gotta snap towels at people

173
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,850
and you gotta give 'em the
business, and if you can't take it,

174
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,190
you know, you—you—
then you can't take it.

175
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,980
You—you gotta leave...
the locker room.

176
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,840
Let's get down to brass tacks.

177
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,450
I know you don't have a lot of time and
I want to thank you for meeting me today.

178
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,810
I just work right there.

179
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,500
Well, thank you for
clearing your schedule.

180
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,750
Oh,I didn't clear anything.

181
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,620
You know this lot that
I'm talking about, right?

182
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,770
Uh,yeah, lot 48.

183
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,480
Um, condo developer.

184
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,790
He dug a basement and
then he went bankrupt.

185
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,350
I checked it out like a month ago.

186
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,940
It's pretty gross.

187
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,450
What would you say if I told you that I
was thinking about turning it into a park?

188
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,140
A park, huh?

189
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,630
Okay.

190
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,620
Well, when I think about the logistics, the various
hoops that you're gonna have to jump through

191
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,510
,I would say—
is it likely?

192
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,220
No, it's not likely, you know.

193
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,900
But is it possible?

194
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,250
No.It's not possible.

195
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,470
I would give up on that one.

196
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,630
What? Why?

197
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,890
Why? Uh,I don't know.There's, like,a
million reasons why.

198
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,520
Uh, homeowners' associations, anti-government
nuts,bureaucrats, miles of red tape—

199
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,620
Really? It sounds like you're
telling me to go for it.

200
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,060
There's no way it can happen.

201
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,680
I can do this.

202
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,680
I just need a little help.

203
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,700
Could you do me a favor?

204
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,570
For old times' sake?

205
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,650
Mark and I—
it's complicated.

206
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,740
When you work closely with someone
and you share similar interests

207
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,780
and you have a similar worldview and you're
passionate about the same things, things can happen.

208
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,040
We slept together.

209
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,340
Leslie?

210
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,280
No.

211
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,960
Oh, my god.

212
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,030
You know what?

213
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,020
Yeah, we did, like five years ago.

214
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,530
I'd
sort of—

215
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,290
No, but yeah.Yeah. We did.

216
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,860
Honey, can you straighten
up your area a little bit?

217
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,760
'Cause they're gonna be here soon.

218
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,430
Can—
thanks.

219
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,770
That parks lady is coming over and
we're gonna go take a look at the pit.

220
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,240
I—I think it's probably
just a photo op for her.

221
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,820
I mean,I don't think anybody in
government actually cares about—

222
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,880
Honey, do you mind doing
that somewhere else?

223
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,790
I'm trying to watch tv.

224
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,970
I'm talking about the pit you fell in.

225
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,730
It's ms. Perkins' house.

226
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,150
Doorbell!

227
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,880
Yeah,I heard it.

228
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,940
Doorbell!

229
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
I heard it.I'm getting it.

230
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm here.

231
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,790
Look at that.

232
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,810
Safety.

233
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,410
You remember tom from last night.

234
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,860
- Hey,ann, how are you?
- Yeah,hey. Of course I do.

235
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,560
And this is our college intern, april.

236
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,080
She's going to be documenting
our fact-finding mission.

237
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,430
Hey, april.

238
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,260
Is this fun for you?

239
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,930
Yeah, it's so much fun.

240
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,480
Uh,I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.

241
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,510
This must be our hero.

242
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,660
The man heard 'round the world.

243
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,320
How you doin', son?

244
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,450
Pretty good.

245
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,850
I'm leslie knope.

246
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,570
And the entire government of pawnee would like to let
you know that we will do everything we can to help you.

247
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,550
Could you pass me my itch stick?

248
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,490
Of course.

249
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,290
So,um, andy jumped over this fence.

250
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,380
He was crossing through to get
home and then he fell right there.

251
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,240
Oh, my god.

252
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,250
How did we let this happen?

253
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,070
Dream with me for a second, ann.

254
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,640
Doesn't this neighborhood
deserve a first-class park?

255
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:11,080
Imagine a shiny new playground with a
jungle gym and swings,pool, tennis courts,

256
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,760
volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball
court, regulation football field.

257
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,900
We could put an amphitheatre over
there with shakespeare in the park.

258
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,670
It's really not that big of a pit.

259
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,550
We could do some of those things.

260
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,080
It's gonna take a little extra work.

261
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,330
But why not try?

262
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,280
I think that would be great.

263
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,890
Me, too.

264
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,840
I'm going in.

265
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,860
- Why?
- 'T w donorry.I have a hard hat on.

266
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,590
- I can see
that, but— Yeah.

267
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,140
- April, document this.
- Okay, why?

268
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,640
The key to any fact-finding mission is to
get right into the battle zone, you know?

269
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:51,600
It's like george bush when he flew over new orleans or richard
nixon when he went to china to see what the chinese were up to.

270
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,910
No.

271
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,840
Leslie, are you okay?

272
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,750
Leslie!

273
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,240
Hold o april's gonna get
some photos for the website.

274
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,500
Can you just be still?

275
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,570
Don't move around as much.

276
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,570
Okay, squeeze my fingers.

277
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,490
Good.

278
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,720
Does it hurt a lot?

279
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,060
No.

280
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,670
I'm fine.

281
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,970
No, you're not.

282
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,220
Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.

283
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,440
But it—
it fell off.

284
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,660
After my head hit that rod.

285
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,050
I can't believe you fell
in,too. That's awesome.

286
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,690
It's not awesome, andy.

287
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,830
Well, at least my boss will listen
to me now that I broke my clavicle.

288
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,240
It's not broken.

289
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,420
It is.

290
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:41,230
Do you have one of those
neck foam collar brace things?

291
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,010
Honestly, you're—
you're fine.

292
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,920
Oh,honestly, my clavicle's broken.

293
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,120
Oh,hey,baby, if you're going to the
kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?

294
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,670
Uh, sure.

295
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,200
Ooh, are pancakes being made?

296
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,820
Yeah, sure.

297
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,770
I don't know, she's a little doofy.

298
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,460
But she's sweet.

299
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,040
Ron, please.

300
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,460
No.No way.

301
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,840
Come on, ron.

302
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,220
I've been a loyal foot soldier.

303
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,710
Give me my shot.

304
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,060
Let me have lot 48.

305
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,790
Is that a travel
pillow around your neck?

306
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,080
Ron,I don't know how
to explain this to you.

307
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,780
When you've been down in the
pit— have you been in the pit?

308
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,330
No,I haven't gotten down there yet.

309
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
- Well,I have.
- When you fell in.

310
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,990
When I visited the bottom of the
pit on a fact-finding mission.

311
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:38,330
And when you're down there, you get some
perspective about what it all means.

312
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,550
And let me tell you something, ron.

313
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:45,400
What it means is... I
want this subcommittee.

314
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,420
I've been quite open about
this around the office.

315
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,220
I don't want this parks department to build
any parks because I don't believe in government.

316
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,630
I think that all government
is a waste of taxpayer money.

317
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:06,600
My dream is to have the park system privatized
and run entirely for profit by corporations.

Lot 48. Thoughts?

326
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,650
Yes?No? Me?

327
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,030
Park? Giving the park to me?

328
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,220
Still mulling.

329
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,630
She's insatiable.

330
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,090
She's like A... little
dog with a— a chew toy.

331
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,030
All right, you guys. All
right, all right.I'll ask him.

332
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,900
Everybody wants to know
what your decision is.

333
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,810
Someone on the phone about the park.

334
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,690
You know,I don't think I even want it.

335
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,350
Oh, man.

336
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,780
The clavicle's still really hurting me.

337
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,060
this is a great shot.

338
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,280
I know.

339
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:07,950
That's awesome.

340
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,350
I think she's crying in
that one. Look at this one.

341
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Hey, kids.

342
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,830
That's another good one.

343
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,020
Hey, brendanawicz.

344
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,550
You gotta come check this out.

345
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,990
Leslie took us out to that pit
in lot 48 and she fell inside.

346
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,540
And we have some awesome photos.

347
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,400
- Uh, is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

348
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,460
Oh, this is a classic.

349
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,170
That's the best one.

350
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,260
The up-skirt photo.

351
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,920
Awesome.

352
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,220
Hey, man.

353
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,070
Give me the photo back.

354
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,560
What's going on?

355
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,970
Don't worry.I can print more.

356
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,320
Leslie is unique.

357
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,710
Um, government work can beat you down.

358
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,790
I would say that I lost my optimism
about government in about two months.

359
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,570
Leslie's kept hers for six years.

360
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,070
I've got a few rules about how to
survive and prosper in a government job,

361
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,830
and I think I'm about to
break one of those rules.

362
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,530
I want you to give lot 48 to leslie
so she can try to build a park.

363
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,510
Why should I?

364
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,550
You owe me one, remember?

365
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,180
Do you want to cash in for this?

366
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,550
Yeah,I do.

367
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,810
So this was built in 1935.

368
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,980
It's called pioneer hall.

369
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:25,930
A little trivia— it is one of the first
structures in america to ever have locks.

370
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,090
Oh, yeah.

371
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,700
This is our crown jewel.

372
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,200
It's one of our best murals.

373
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,360
It depicts the very famous
battle at conega creek.

374
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,420
We have a lot of children visit, so often we have
to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster.

375
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,340
That is horrifying.

376
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,370
Yes, it is.

377
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,380
So what do you want to
see? The dmv? Animal control?

378
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,800
- Or we
could— Leslie.

379
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,360
We did it.

380
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,190
Ron's approved our committee.

381
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,070
- Oh,m D.
- That's great!

382
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,700
- That's so great.
- That's so exciting!

383
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,840
This is huge.

384
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,440
I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a
parks department exploratory subcommittee.

385
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,470
I'm a rocket ship.

386
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,960
Leslie.

387
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,150
I just heard the news.

388
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,450
- Isn't it great?
- Congratulations.

389
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,060
Thank you.I'm so excited.

390
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,330
It's exciting, isn't it?

391
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,920
- It is.
- Yeah.

392
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,370
Should I call a press conference now, or?

393
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,840
- Yeah, call one. Definitely.
- I would.

394
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,260
Every now and then we have these little
gatherings and leslie gets plastered.

395
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,900
One time I convinced her to try
to fax someone a fruit roll-up.

396
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,610
She one time made out with the
water delivery guy in her office.

397
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,590
On halloween, she was
dressed up as batman.

398
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,670
Not batgirl. Batman.

399
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,490
And I convinced her to go stop a
crime that was going on outside.

400
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,050
And it is my favorite
thing in the world.

401
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,110
You know what? America is awesome.

402
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,340
It's so full of hope and small
towns and big cities and real people

403
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,530
and delicious beverages and hot guys.

404
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,010
You just never know when
opportunity is gonna strike.

405
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,250
- Yeah.
- You gotta be ready for it.

406
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,390
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?

407
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,300
- Definitely am. Fired up.
- Yeah!

408
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,280
I'm really fired up.

409
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,980
I—you know they say that democracy or
whatever only works when people get involved?

410
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,570
Well,I'm getting involved.

411
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,720
So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do
whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.

412
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,520
Even if it takes two months.

413
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,090
Soul sista, soul sista

414
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,090
- gonna get your phone, sista
- Yeah.

415
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,910
Sweet lady marmalard

418
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,200
I've created this office as a symbol
of how I feel about government.

419
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,930
This sawed-off shotgun
belonged to a local bootlegger.

420
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,680
People who come in here to ask me for
things have to stare right down the barrel.

421
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:51,340
Did you guys get a grant to do this?

422
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,130
This is my basketball court.

423
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,860
I don't want to see any double dribble.

424
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,440
I don't want to see any
three-second violations.

425
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,300
Bobby knight!
