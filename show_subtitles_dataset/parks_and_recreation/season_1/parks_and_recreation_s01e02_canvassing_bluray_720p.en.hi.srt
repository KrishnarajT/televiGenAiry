I think You might be taking this

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,885
To the public A little bit too soon.

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,310
It literally doesn't matter
What you propose to the public,

60
00:02:28,345 --> 00:02:29,555
They might call for a vote.

61
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,235
And if they vote you
down, Then you're done.

62
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,880
I don't care If there's gonna be a vote.

63
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:34,600
I have a secret weapon.

64
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,120
Canvassing.

65
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,310
Nothing better Than good
old-fashioned Door-to-door campaigning.

66
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,465
I'm not above using My expertise

67

To change hearts and
minds If the cause is just.

68
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,275

70
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,610

63 people In my class.

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,305
Andy fell into that pit.

73
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,370
How many more pawnee citizens
Are going to have to fall

74
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,850

75

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,030
This is a little something
I learned from karl rove.

178
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:54,660
If you want to guarantee
The results of a survey,

179
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:56,365
You design the question

180
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,390
To give you the answer That you want.

181
00:06:58,425 --> 00:06:59,755
"wouldn't you rather have A park

182
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,020
Than a storage facility
For nuclear waste?"

183
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,225
That seems iffy.

184
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,910
Yeah, don't worry about
it. I made it all up.

185
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:07,390
Yeah, that's—
That's what i mean.

186
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:08,645
Wouldn't you agree,

187
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,575
Like most decent aricans,

188
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,430
That it would be a good idea To turn

189
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,492
The abandoned lot On sullivan street

190
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,520
Into a beautiful community park?

191
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:17,905
Oh,actually, no.

192
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,515
I'm not really a fan Of parks.

193
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,940
Very noisy. Barbecue smell all the time.

194
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,925
Would you change your mind If i told you

195
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,650
That nine out of ten meth
users Said the same exacthing?

196
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:29,845
What?

197
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,380
How would you even know that?

198
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:34,165
Survey.

199
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,140
We surveyed crystal meth users.

200
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,715

201
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,960

202
00:07:40,995 --> 00:07:42,555

So do you have a flier Or something?

205
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,570

207
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,070
You don't care About your kids
If you don't support this park.

208
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:58,030
Excuse me?

209
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,825

210
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,825

All of a sudden, there's all
This federal money coming in,

And paul, the city manager, Is telling us

257
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,290
To build parks, Start
new community programs.

258
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:52,945
It's horrifying.

259
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,830

260
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:56,397

- It can
bericky— - Don't.

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,825
Why do i want to build This park so bad?

271
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,810
Maybe because a pit filled
With garbage isn't the best

272
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:36,370
That we can do In america.

273
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,705
You know, in russia,

274
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,040
They could pretend That pit was a park.

275
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:42,627
Bring their kids down there.

276
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:44,786
"hey,vlad, Look at these rocks.

277
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:46,910

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,700
Do you want to swim In the dirt?"

280
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,475
But not here, okay?

281
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,400
'Cause we're a nation Of dreamers.

282
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,537

283
00:10:57,572 --> 00:10:59,640

How was canvassing?

292
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,625
Canvassing was okay.

293
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,890
But i think we're going to have To

294
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,900

295
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,595

And,together, we have decided
To fast-track your project.

303
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:54,625
City manager? Wow, really?

304
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,120

Oh, no,i can't do that.

363
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:51,775
That's illegal.

364
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,660
Thank you so much For
coming out tonight.

365
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:55,745
This is our first ti

366
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,505
About the proposal To turn lot 48

367
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,870
On sullivan street In a community park.

368
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,945
Yeah!

369
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,465
This is gonna be A train wreck.

370
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I want my daughter To be successful.

371
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,365
Which is why i always tell her,

372
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,710
"there's nothing wrong With
being a wife and mother."

373
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:16,862
Now, there are many
people That i spoke to

374
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,348
Who are passionately
in support Of this idea.

375
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:21,800
None of them were able
To make it tonight,

376
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:22,925
Unfortunately.

377
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,535
But they totally exist.

378
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,505
I did not make them up.

379
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,440
Oh,i see a question. Okay.

380
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,855
No, no.

381
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,795
No. No questions right now.

382
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,930
- My name is kate speevack...
- I remember you.

383
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:37,807
And i live In the neighborhood.

384
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:40,615
And i am 100% Against this park.

385
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,755
I cannot believe the
department Is moving forward

386
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,040
With a project without a single
Environmental impact study.

387
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:47,830
And if you guys agree With me,

388
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,890
Let's ke a stand.

389
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,290
Okay.

390
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,525
Um, we are a little ahead Of schedule

391
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,990
Because we're holding This
town hall meeting so soon.

392
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:05,817
Which i was warned about
By mark brendanawicz,

393
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:08,610
Our city planner
Assigned to this project.

394
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,040
Uh, so what would he say?

395
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,060
Here we are.

396
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,545
Leslie, should i give them

397
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,880
Some background info On the site?

398
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:22,845
Absolutely, okay.

399
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,795
Mark brendanawicz knows The
answer to every question.

400
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,710
He's amazing, And congratulations
for hearing Him speak.

401
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,940
Hi, there. Leslie might have
Oversold me a little bit.

402
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:33,982
Certainly did not. He's the man.

403
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,955
He's capable of anything. Okay.

404
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,600
Lot 48 is,uh, It's a rectangular lot.

405
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:40,675
It's got excellent drainage,

406
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,400
And it's on the corner
Of sullivan and collins.

407
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,065
Any questions?

408
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,105
I have more of a
comment Than a question.

409
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,110
- Go for it.
- It's for the guy in the cast.

410
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,670
Here we go. Lawrence.

411
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:52,405
Yes,yes, yes.

412
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,825
That is andy dwyer.

413
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,690
He is a local resident, and
He tragicay ll in the pit.

414
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:00,185
Uh, yeah,i don't care About any of that.

415
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,510
He's the guy that plays
music All night in his garage.

416
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,195
It's driving me nuts.

417
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,300
Lawrence lives With his grandma.

418
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,085
Which is pretty awesome.

419
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,365
He takes care ofer,i guess.

420
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,570
But whatever. He's a douche bag.

421
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,525
It's loud. It's abusive.

422
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,040
And it's waking up My birds.

423
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:18,442
You have birds now?

424
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,775
Yeah,i have birds.

425
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,255
I have nice,pretty, Expensive birds.

426
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,245
And you play that
music, And it wakes them up.

427
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,200
Look,i don't work For
the government, okay.

428
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,150
Uh,i do py rock & roll.

429
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:29,412
Guilty as charged.

430
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,605
I'm in a band.

431
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,465
It's called just the tip.

432
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,720
And,actually, If anyone here
plays bass, We need a bassist.

433
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:39,320
Yes,okay, let's take A
five-minute break, shall we?

434
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,670
Uh, it is not going well At all.

435
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:45,415
It's going very poorly.

436
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,275
Okay, like you're crashing And burning.

437
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,580
Democracy's happening.
People are talking.

438
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,850
I mean, at least They
aren't apathetic, right?

439
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:54,137
You're right about that.

440
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:55,355
They're deeply negative.

441
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,220
You need to put a happy face On this,

442
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:59,050
Give me A few positive talking points.

443
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,980
And whatever you do, Avd a vote.

444
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:11,560
I'm oddly attracted To kate speevack.

445
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,400
Before we continue,I'd
love to just give you

446
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,195
A little history of wnee.

447
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,785
The city of pawnee Was
incorporated in 1817

448
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,620
When a young man by the name
Of reverend luther howell

449
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:28,155
Came from terre haute On an ox.

450
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,890
He planted his flag In
the ground and was met

451
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,590
Soon aft by an angry
tribe Of wamapoke indians,

452
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:38,430
Who, when seeing the
whiteness Of his skin,

453
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:40,460
Twisted him to death.

454
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,090
Flash forward to 1969.

455
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,295
Man walks on the moon.

456
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,935
Pawnee is lousy With hippies...

457
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,230
My god, she's filibustering
Her own meeting.

458
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:54,135
Mod squad—
Filibuster. Boom.

459
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,910
They can't touch you
If you talk forever.

460
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:57,820
I can't speak of the future.

461
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,245
But i will.

462
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,850
The future of pawnee will
Involve us flying around

463
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:05,495
In space taxis Where we will communicate

464
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:11,140
On watches and blink Our
feelings to each other

465
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,002
Rather than use words.

466
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:14,795
And now i'd like to take

467
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,350
A magical journey
Through a little something

468
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:19,410
I like to call The phantom tollbooth

469
00:18:19,445 --> 00:18:20,995
By norton juster.

470
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,085
Excuse me, can't you read

471
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,670
That children's book On your own time?

472
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,300
I have the floor.

473
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,765
"there once was a boy Named milo

474
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,170
"who didn't know what
to do With himself.

475
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:32,505
Not just
sometimes, But always"--

476
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,085
Okay, all right, You know
what, This is a public forum,

477
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,630
Which means that we all get
To tell you what we think.

478
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:40,175
Well, you did already talk, Ma'am.

479
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,210
And i would love To
listen to someone else,

480
00:18:42,245 --> 00:18:43,587
Someone i don't know.

481
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,895
Uh, that girl over there

482
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,250
With the long brown
hair And the yellow top.

483
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,570
Could you tell us how
you feel About this park?

484
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,845
- Go ahead.
- Hi.

485
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,255
Uh,i'm a youth In the community,

00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,780
And i think a new park Is a great ia.

487
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:00,575
And i fully support it,

488
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,880
As would the rest of the
youth In the community.

489
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:05,625
Hey,i recognize her.

490
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,395
That kid came to my door Yesterday.

491
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,250
Oh, my god,okay, they have
Planted people in this audience.

492
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:12,585
Unbelievable.

493
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,970
U know what, we all agree
That this park is a baidea.

494
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:16,665
We should just take a vote.

495
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,215
- Right?
- Okay, we will take a vote Before we do that,

496
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,730
I want everyone up, Lined
up behind that microphone.

497
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:23,820
I want to hear from
all of you, One-by-one.

498
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:24,955
That was brutal.

499
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,420
A couple weeks ago,I was yelling

500
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:27,815
At leslie At a public forum.

501
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,400
God,i hope i wasn't As
obnoxious as those people.

502
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,675
I wasn't, right?

503
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,165
At 5:00 in the
morning, Every morning—

504
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,035
Beep,beep, beep— I
don't want to hear that.

505
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,835
Now, how long Is this project gonna take?

506
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,210
That's what i wanna know.
That's what's important to me.

507
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,335
Because i need my sleep.

508
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,550
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.
That concludes our meeting.

We're out of time. It's 9:00.

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,720
But we will have many
Public forums in the future,

00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:55,832
And we hope To see you all there.

513
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,910
Thank you so much For coming.

514
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,785
It was tough.

515
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,785
But, you know, that's
pawnee. That's democracy.

516
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,240
There are a lot of people
here That want this park.

517
00:20:16,275 --> 00:20:18,700
You just gotta get past
The negative people.

518
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:19,835
But guess what?

519
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,910
My subcommittee held its First
town hall meeting tonight.

520
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:25,940
God,i loved it.

521
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,090
I loved every minute of it.

522
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,345
Hey, park lady.

523
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,800

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,430
He called me park lady.

526

I don't agree with
