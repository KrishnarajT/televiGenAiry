You know as well as I do That we are not allowed
To accept gifts over $25 For corruptioneasons.

31
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,754
We live in a fish bowl, and
The public is always watching.

32
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,226
That's why I go Two towns over If I
want to rent a movie With nudity in it.

33
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:16,754
yeah, I probably
Shouldn't have said that.

00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:19,506
But you cannot Enjoy
this basket. I'm so sorry.

35

when you're In the government, There's
a million ways To exploit your power.

00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,181
Have I ever given in
To that temptation?

38
00:02:28,244 --> 00:02:30,628

that kind Of politician.

Sorry about that, Little girl.

41
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:38,587
I have a moral code,
And I never violate it.

42
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:40,212
People look at me
And they say,

43
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:44,120

That was the sound Of a
glass ceiling Being shattered.

81

The boys' club is more about Socializing than
work, you know? I mean, you gotta loosen up.

I violated the government Employee
ethics code Of the state of indiana.

104

I have always tried to live My life in
an ethical way, And last night I failed.

105

ann is amazing.

119
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:56,154
She takes care of me. She takes care of
sick people, Sick babies. She is an angel.

120
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:00,473
And I seriously love her.
Hard.

121
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,514
She's going to be gone
For the next 24 hours.

122
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:09,321
So I made this list, And basically This place is
gonna be Like a sparkling palace When she returns.

123
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:13,665
I took a bunch Of pain killers. They're
about to kick in, So I'm ready to go.

124
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,827
here it is.
Let's clear the air.

125
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:23,684
Last night I opened up This gift
basket For my own pleasure. Really?

126
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:27,170
Leslie knope, usually such A
prudish stickler For the rules.

127
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:30,386
I'm not happy About it either, tom.
it's like I don't even Know you anymore.

128
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:33,672
last year you wrote me up For
making personal one calls To my mom.

129
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,924
yes, I did, And I would do it again.
Two wrongs Do not make a right.

130
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,893
yes, but she
Was in the hospital.

131
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:41,588
I did not know that
At the time.

132
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:44,793
so can I have the basket?
no, I'm sorry. It's evidence.

133
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:47,227
it's a nice basket. What
would you Put in there?

134
00:08:47,915 --> 00:08:50,216
I d't know, Potpourri.
that's a lot of potpourri.

135
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:51,961
hey, I am not the one
On trial here.

136
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:55,594
I appreciate And thank you in
advance For your unwavering support.

137
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:57,695
I think you should Go to jail,
Think about what you've done.

138
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,740
go to jail?
What's going on?

139
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:04,476
ron, I have a very important
And very long story To tell yo

140
00:09:06,771 --> 00:09:08,455
put it in an email?
nope.

141
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:13,340
It happened right out there,
Right outside this window.

142
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,895
Why can't I look away? let's
not blow this Out of proportion.

143
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,137
I will blow this
In proportion.

144
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:25,143
The minimum punishment for this Is an
official reprimand From the city manager.

145
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:28,467
it's not that big a deal. Maybe
in your world It isn't a big deal.

146
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,929
You're a white protestant man
With a full, rich moustache.

147
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:36,074
But I am a woman, And I need to
hold myself up To a higher standard.

148
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:41,016
this is ridiculous. Yore punishing yourself
More than anybody else no Is gonna punish you.

149
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,866
What do you suggest we do? You
think we should Cover this up?

150
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:46,912
no, I'm not saying that.
No one said "cover-up".

151
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:49,889
good because the cover-up
Is worse than the crime.

152
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:55,528
When you spill something And you try to wipe it up
With something that's dirty, Then you get double dirty.

153
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,315
please don't Make
this worse. Oh, my god.

154
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,931
Good afternoon.

155
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:06,905
Since we last spoke, I have taken extraordinary steps
To make further amends For the mistakes that I've made.

156
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,169
I have written
A full confession,

157
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:14,080
Which I will be emailing To everyone
in the entire Pawnee government.

158
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:20,373

Just to remind people Of all the good work that I do.

159
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:23,796
I asked ron to blow The
whistle on me, And he refused.

160
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,305
And that is why
I had to whistle-blow myself.

161
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:34,239
I wish I could say Some of this
mess was ann's, But it's all mine.

162
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:36,399
I'm kind of a nester.

163
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:41,135

With two broken legs.

What club is this?

225
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:48,255
a couple city planners Like to drink
beer In the courtyard On tuesday nights.

226
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,115
no one is supposeto drink
Alcohol on government property.

227
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,798
it's not my department.
Go ahead, leslie.

228
00:14:55,762 --> 00:15:01,286
"I made A very unwise decision, "a
decision that will live In infamy.

229
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:04,429
"I opened a gift basket
Of wine and cheese.

"she lives in a world "where the very
idea Of boys' clubs Is ancient history."

235
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:35,737
but you did
Open the gift basket.

236
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:40,781
And the intern Did drink the wine.
Please don't blame her For my mistake.

237
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:49,773
The biggest crime We could commit here Would be to
destroy A teenage girl's passion For local government.

238
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:54,216
there's only one more
thing I need to clean— Me.

239
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:58,989
Um, I can't really Get into a shower,
So I got this idea From my parents.

240
00:16:00,314 --> 00:16:02,157
This is how
They clean their dog.

241
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,239
You like that?

242
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:11,997
I wrote that for ann.

243
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:14,712
It's gonna be playing when she
Walks through the door today.

244
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:16,666
And check this out.

245
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,886

249
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:35,430

250
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:36,620
Put that down!

251
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:39,650
I just put 12 new batteries
In that thing!

252
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:47,068

00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:52,826
Go back inside, hank.

255
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:57,553
ms. Knope, what was The first thing you
did When you arrived at work The next day?

256
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:00,755
Can you go over the timeline
For us once more? yes, of course.

257
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,736
I awoke at 6:21 a.m. After a fitful
night of sleep. We've been over this.

258
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:08,984
What more could you guys
Possibly want her to do?

259
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:12,691
well, we don't know yet. Frankly,
we've got A lot more questions.

260
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,113
ron, it's okay.
no, it's not.

261
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:17,082
This is not communist china.

262
00:17:17,117 --> 00:17:20,816
You cannot Make her whip herself.
You cannot make her Wear a hair shirt.

263
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:24,481
we weren't planning On doing either
of those things. This is america.

264
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:29,003
You wanna live In north korea, You can
live in north korea. I don't want to.

265
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:30,635
I want to live in america.

266
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:36,005
Leslie has never broken A rule in her
life, To the point That it's annoying.

267
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:39,093
If you want to slap her
On the wrist, go ahead.

268
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:42,128
You wanna Do anything more serious,
You're gonnaave To go through me.

269
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:43,281
Let's go.
are we done?

270
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:44,400
we're done.
Let's go.

271
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:54,519
So after all that, It's really not that
bad. You're gonna get a letter In your file.

272
00:17:55,564 --> 00:17:57,892
ron, I just wanted To say thank
you— don't worry about it.

273
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:08,892
No, I didn't do it For leslie. I
did it because I hate bureaucracy.

274
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:15,198
My idea Of a perfect government Is one
guy who sits In a small room at a desk,

275
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:18,116
And the only thing He's allowed
to decide Is who to nuke.

276
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:25,824
The man is chosen Based on some kind of iq test And
maybe also A physical tournament, Like a decathlon.

277
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,392
And women are
Brought to him maybe

278
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,810
When he sires them.

279
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,466
oh, hey, ann, You're here.
yeah, I came From the hospital.

280
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:39,029
How'd it go? I don't
wanna Be overdramatic,

281
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:43,790
But today felt like 100 years in hell And
the absolute worst day Of my life. Oh, god.

282
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:46,335
I never shoulda opened
That stupid basket.

283
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,892
yeah, why did you Open that basket?
It doesn't really Seem like you.

284
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,915
I think it's 'cause I wanted
To shatter the glass ceiling,

285
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,581
You know what I mean? And just
kind of infiltrate The boys' club.

286
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,635
I did it for a guy.

287
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,413
oh.
yeah.

288
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,378

affair In february Of 2004.

291
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:19,568
And, um, there's still Something
very complicated Between us, so.
