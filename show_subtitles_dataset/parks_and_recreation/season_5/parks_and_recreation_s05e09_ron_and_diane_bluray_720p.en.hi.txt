1
00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:05,351
Merry Congratu-Christmas!

2
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:06,751
- What?
- Half "Merry Christmas,"

3
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,269
half "Congratulations,"

4
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:09,670
because
I just received some news.

5
00:00:09,672 --> 00:00:13,107
You, Ron Swanson,
have been nominated for an award

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,226
from the Indiana
Fine Woodworking Association.

7
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:17,312
How did you hear
about that?

8
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:18,613
I've had
a "Ron Swanson" Google alert

9
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,848
for seven years
and it finally paid off.

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,985
Recently,
I made a chair.

11
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:27,872
When I was finished,
I thought it was a good chair.

12
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:31,326
I submitted it to the Indiana
Fine Woodworking Association,

13
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:35,196
who felt it merited
consideration for an award.

14
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:37,532
It's been a real whirlwind.

15
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:38,683
I have to confess,

16
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:40,585
I'm very honored
by this nomination.

17
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:41,753
Right?

18
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:42,920
This might be
the first time

19
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:44,589
I've ever wanted
to attend an event.

20
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:46,441
Oh, my God,
I love events!

21
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:47,658
I can't wait
to go tonight.

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,960
Why are you going?

23
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:50,795
As your self-appointed
emotional guardian,

24
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:53,298
it is my duty
to love and support you.

25
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,299
Plus, you know,
this is a big deal.

26
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,517
You shouldn't
be there alone.

27
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:57,218
That's correct.
I'm bringing Diane.

28
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,386
Things are going
very well with us.

29
00:00:58,388 --> 00:01:00,472
Even better.
I am very excited to meet Diane.

30
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:02,340
You're not taking "no"
for an answer, are you?

31
00:01:02,342 --> 00:01:03,358
Oh, I forgot
to sing you

32
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,009
my merry Congratu-Christmas
carol.

33
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,896
♪ Jingle bells, jingle yay,
jingle good for you ♪

34
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:09,030
- Get out.
- Yup.

00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,719
How about the new sushi place
in Eagleton?

37
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:32,870
I'm allergic
to sushi.

38
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:35,557
Every time I eat
more than 80 sushis, I barf.

39
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:37,675
Hey, Ann, you been to
any swanky restaurants lately?

40
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:39,094
- What's the occasion?
- It's December.

41
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,378
It's the time
we celebrate

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,730
our most sacred
and special event:

43
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:45,016
♪ Jerry Dinner
♪ Jerry Dinner

44
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:48,553
♪ Jerry Dinner
♪ Jerry Dinner

45
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:50,071
what the hell
is Jerry Dinner?

46
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:52,440
Every time we laugh
at something stupid Jerry does,

47
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:54,492
we put a dollar
in this box.

48
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:56,611
At the end of the year,
we take all the cash

49
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,830
and treat ourselves
to a fancy dinner.

50
00:01:58,832 --> 00:02:00,448
This year, we have...

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,401
$516.

52
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:06,204
Aw, jeez!

53
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,506
And that's 517.

54
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:11,292
Oh!

55
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:12,961
518.

56
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:17,081
You guys,
that's so mean.

57
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,384
It's not mean
if he doesn't know about it.

58
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:21,469
It's like talking about people
behind their backs.

59
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:23,555
- Everybody wins.
- No.

60
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,974
You should at least
invite Jerry to the dinner.

61
00:02:25,976 --> 00:02:27,142
Ha!

62
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:29,060
That's hilarious.
You should do stand-up.

63
00:02:29,562 --> 00:02:31,729
If you're kidding, you suck,
but if you're serious,

64
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:33,448
I actually have been
thinking about it.

65
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,735
Hey, April, Matlock called.
He wants his cardigan back.

66
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:39,937
Boom! I'm out.

67
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:41,956
Who's Matlock?

68
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,158
Hey, bud.

69
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,609
- Hey!
- How are you?

70
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:47,278
Great. I just finished making
an entry in my dream journal.

71
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,550
This time, the giant spider
got caught in my web.

72
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,670
Progress.

73
00:02:55,672 --> 00:02:58,223
So I feel like we haven't
gotten a ton of time together

74
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,807
since I got back
from D.C.

75
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:01,959
Well, we both
are in serious relationships.

76
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,795
You have Leslie
and I have my therapist,

77
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:07,182
Dr. Richard Nygard,
who I see 15 times a week.

78
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:10,435
Well, Leslie has plans
tonight, so I'm solo.

79
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:12,487
- You wanna hang out?
- I'd love to.

80
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,989
It... it'll be just like
old times in Indianapolis.

81
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,275
- We're back.
- All right.

82
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,946
Lots of hugs.

83
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:25,083
Welcome to the Indiana
Fine Woodworking Awards,

84
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:27,502
or as I like to call it,
heaven.

85
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:28,986
- Ron.
- Ah!

86
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:31,039
Leslie, may I present
Diane Lewis?

87
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,490
- Oh.
- Diane, this is Leslie Knope.

88
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:35,043
Diane, wow. Ron has told me
so much about you,

89
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:37,178
in that he has told me your name
is Diane, and you exist.

90
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,179
Oh, yeah.

91
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,347
He's not
a big sharer.

92
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,848
I don't even know
what his middle name is.

93
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,217
Oh, it's Ulysses.

94
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:43,851
I can see
why he didn't tell me that.

95
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:45,887
Mary, mother of God.

96
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,691
That's
Christian Becksvoort!

97
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,643
He's the modern master
of the Shaker style.

98
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:54,395
I never dreamed that I would
see him in the flesh.

99
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,197
Go over
and say hello.

100
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:58,516
No, I'm sure he gets swamped
with attention all the time.

101
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:01,319
Ooh, if you ladies
will excuse me,

102
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,988
there is a jack plane
that needs my attention.

103
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,623
Go on then.

104
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,709
So tell me
everything about yourself:

105
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:09,661
Your kids,
your hobbies.

106
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:10,712
What are
your five biggest hopes,

107
00:04:10,714 --> 00:04:12,747
dreams, fears,
and regrets?

108
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:15,500
In honor
of Jerry Dinner,

109
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:19,036
let's each say our favorite
Jerry moment from the past year.

110
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:20,672
- Yes.
- Mine was...

111
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,307
The time
he slipped on a cinnabon

112
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:23,708
and landed
in a bunch of garbage.

113
00:04:25,095 --> 00:04:28,263
My favorite Jerry moment
was when he ate a bowl of glue.

114
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,599
My favorite Jerry moment
is when

115
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:34,852
you switched out his potato soup
with glue and he didn't know.

116
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,237
You're so cute

117
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,272
when you're bullying,
babe.

118
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:39,240
You know what?
Ann was right.

119
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:41,943
This is mean.
We are going to pick up Jerry.

120
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,528
- What?
- No!

121
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,530
It's Christmastime. Don't you
want to be good people?

122
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:46,781
- Not really.
- Never.

123
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:47,782
Hey,
if we're going that way,

124
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:48,866
can we stop at our place
real quick?

125
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:50,368
'Cause I forgot
to put on deodorant.

126
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,171
And a jacket
and one of my socks.

127
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:55,556
Plus, I gotta poop, but
I could stop anywhere for that.

128
00:04:55,558 --> 00:04:58,793
I know you didn't, but if you
had gone to Hogwarts Academy,

129
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,211
which House do you think
you would have been?

130
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:02,180
Look, obviously,

131
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,298
I want to say Gryffindor...

132
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,915
But I've got to go
with Hufflepuff.

133
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,351
I respect
your honesty.

134
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:09,103
Gryffindor.
Seeker on the Quidditch team.

135
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,639
Diane, that's my chair,
right there.

136
00:05:11,641 --> 00:05:14,475
It's beautiful, Ron.
Yours is the winner.

137
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:16,394
I'm not sure
I stand a chance.

138
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:19,430
Hey,
you most certainly do.

139
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:22,066
They'd be crazy
not to vote for you.

140
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,318
Which one is Ron's?

141
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,453
I don't know.

142
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:27,622
Smart, funny,
independent, and sexy?

143
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:31,125
Diane Lewis?
More like Diane Sawyer.

144
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:34,128
Whoa! What is going on
at the Gergiches?

145
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,463
Whoa.

146
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,632
Oh, my God! Jerry's having
a Christmas party!

147
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:39,083
I can't believe
he didn't invite us.

148
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,301
How dare he!

149
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,419
What'd we ever
do to him?

150
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:42,754
It's probably
just family.

151
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,789
And Ben and Chris.

152
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:48,176
And Ann. I didn't even know
she knew Jerry.

153
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:51,629
Wow. The Gergiches
really go all out.

154
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,765
This is incredible.

155
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:55,566
Mmm!
This is literally

156
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:57,985
the best non-fat eggnog
I've ever had.

157
00:05:57,987 --> 00:06:00,738
Remain calm,
but I think you just drank

158
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,974
some of the regular,
full-fat eggnog.

159
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:06,277
Chris,
one cup won't kill you.

160
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,997
No, but it will add
exactly 440 calories.

161
00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:13,584
But you know what?
I'm fine.

162
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:16,788
You only live once.

163
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,290
Mmm! I don't know
if you know this,

164
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,491
but things
with fat in them

165
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,627
taste way better
than things with no fat.

166
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:24,679
Yeah, Chris...
everybody knows that.

167
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:27,715
Ron, guess
why my thumbs are up.

168
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,166
No.

169
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:31,669
Because I'm giving you
my 100% approval about Diane.

170
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:34,055
She is perfect for you.
She gets you.

171
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:37,308
She is at the bar right
now ordering a Lagavulin, neat

172
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,193
for you. I mean,
she's even putting up

173
00:06:39,195 --> 00:06:42,563
with all this stupid,
boring woodworking stuff.

174
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:45,533
I'm sorry, but, you know,
it's not the Super Bowl, guys.

175
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,151
Let's take it down
a notch.

176
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,353
Anyway,
you have my approval.

177
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:50,371
I don't need
your approval.

178
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:51,489
- But you have it.
- Don't need it.

179
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,858
But you got it.

180
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,576
This could
end up being

181
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:57,545
the best night
in Ron Swanson's life.

182
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:58,830
I am so, so happy
for him...

183
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:02,216
Hello, you gorgeous craftsmen.

184
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:04,201
Wow,
look at this room.

185
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:07,221
So much wood,
ready to be worked.

186
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,091
[Bleep] me!

187
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,446
Alert...
alert, alert, alert.

188
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:17,246
She's here, isn't she?

189
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:20,917
Oh, hey, Ron.
What a coincidence.

190
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,085
Gosh, I never dreamed
you'd be here.

191
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:25,138
Tammy,
this is Diane.

192
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,441
Diane, this is a piece
of human garbage named Tammy,

193
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:29,776
who is also
my ex-wife.

194
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:31,778
Twice ex-wife.
We were married twice.

195
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,979
And divorced twice.

196
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,064
Everything is done.
They are totally done.

197
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:36,783
Tammy,
what are you doing here?

198
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:40,603
Oh, I just have a little
something I need to get drilled.

199
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:42,739
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

200
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,540
Everything's fine,
we're just gonna chat.

201
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:48,194
Shouldn't you be at the library,
forcing people to borrow books?

202
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:49,328
Leslie,
you and I both know

203
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,880
that the library closes
at 3:00 p.m.

204
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:52,382
Of course it does.

205
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:53,883
Besides, I like
to keep tabs on Ron.

206
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:55,534
So you can ruin
his life?

207
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:56,969
So I can have fun
with him,

208
00:07:56,971 --> 00:08:00,039
and sometimes ruining his life
can be a part of that, sure.

209
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,891
This may be
the hardest challenge yet

210
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:03,375
for Leslie Knope,
emotional guardian.

211
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:05,428
I need to protect
a sweet couple

212
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,397
from a sex-crazed
demon librarian

213
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,149
who makes me question my stance
on using the "B" word.

214
00:08:10,151 --> 00:08:11,567
I don't know,
maybe just this once.

215
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,553
No, Leslie, fight it.
Fight it.

216
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:17,890
It looks warm in there!

217
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:19,075
Warm and happy.

218
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:21,527
Mm, look at
that gingerbread man.

219
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,696
What? I don't see
any gingerbread cookies.

220
00:08:23,698 --> 00:08:25,564
I'm talking about that
jacked-up, light-skinned dude.

221
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:26,916
Look like
Blake Griffin.

222
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:28,751
You guys!

223
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:31,587
There's a buffet...
in the house!

224
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,372
I didn't even know
you could do that!

225
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:34,841
We need
to crash this party.

226
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:38,028
Ann, let us in.

227
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,380
Let's go.

228
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:43,599
Well, well, well.

229
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:46,752
You want to come
into Jerry's party?

230
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:48,104
And why is that?

231
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:49,922
I need a place
to deliver this baby, Ann.

232
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:51,274
It's coming out of me right now.
I'm pregnant.

233
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:53,726
This is a lovely party

234
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:56,479
thrown by a lovely man
and his lovely family.

235
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,231
There's no place
for meanies.

236
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,399
Aw, forget it,
I'm coming in.

237
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:01,400
Ow!

238
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:02,985
- Get off me.
- Wait.

239
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,937
You're so weak, really?

240
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:05,988
I mean,

241
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,406
I'm barely even
doing anything.

242
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:09,492
Are you iron-deficient?
Let me look at your palm.

243
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:11,828
Ow. It's because
of your man strength,

244
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,412
Man Perkins.

245
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:14,664
Let us in, Ann.

246
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,998
It's cold outside,
and I can't wear mittens

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,917
'cause they're unflattering
to my hands.

248
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,669
Sorry, guys.
This is your penance.

249
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:22,121
You can come in if you
do something nice for Jerry.

250
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:24,257
Hey, I already
did something nice for Jerry.

251
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,592
I drove here
to take him to Jerry Dinner.

252
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:28,961
Oh, Donna.
You can come in.

253
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:29,979
Okay.

254
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:31,130
What? What about us?

255
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:33,316
- What? Donna!
- Merry critches, bitches!

256
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:34,984
Donna, don't leave us!
Donna?

257
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:36,302
Oh, well, whatever.

258
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:38,521
It's Jerry's party.
How cool could it be?

259
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:39,939
Santa!

260
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:41,307
- They have a Santa!
- Oh, my God.

261
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,975
- What?
- Aw!

262
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:46,979
Welcome to the Indiana Fine
Woodworking Association Awards.

263
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:51,334
I'm your host,
Martin Housely,

264
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:52,535
and wow,
it's gonna be a great show...

265
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:53,536
knock on wood.

266
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,990
- That's good.
- Oh, my gosh.

267
00:09:57,992 --> 00:09:59,992
What a coinky-dinky. Look,
we're sitting at the same table!

268
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:02,929
Tammy,
this table is reserved.

269
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:05,097
A guy traded me his seat
for a peek and a squeeze.

270
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,099
That's my boob and my butt,
respectively.

271
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:09,135
Remember that, Ron?

272
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:10,520
Subtle.

273
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,171
Well, you know, they asked me
if I would host this event,

274
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:16,175
and I said, "Would I?"

275
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:18,677
Ben, come meet
Jerry's wife.

276
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,612
Gayle?

277
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:24,683
- Happy holidays, Chris.
- It's so good to see you.

278
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:25,818
I have someone
I'd like you to meet.

279
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,354
I'm Gayle Gergich.

280
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,824
Gayle...
you're Gayle?

281
00:10:31,826 --> 00:10:33,242
Jerry's
beautiful wife...

282
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:35,878
- Oh.
- Who looks like that.

283
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,196
Gayle, I hope you're not

284
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:39,298
in any way uncomfortable
that I'm here,

285
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,335
- since I dated your daughter.
- Oh, not at all.

286
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,387
You're welcome here
any time.

287
00:10:44,689 --> 00:10:47,506
Oops, there's a little hair
on your shoulder.

288
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:48,707
Oh.

289
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:52,511
Well, look who's a silver fox.

290
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:55,231
Will you look at that?

291
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,183
I'm sorry,
you're okay?

292
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,385
You don't feel like
your body is in decay

293
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:00,653
or death
is inevitable?

294
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:04,890
My, my. Somebody's
being a gloomy goose.

295
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:08,411
Yeah.
Relax, gloomy goose.

296
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:12,949
Welcome, everybody,
to another Gergich Christmas.

297
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:15,368
Sadly, one of our
three beautiful angels,

298
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,702
Millicent,
couldn't be here tonight,

299
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:19,622
but our other two beauties...
Miriam and Gladys...

300
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:22,625
are going to help Gayle
and me play a little tune.

301
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:29,765
♪ Here we go a-caroling,
among the leaves so green ♪

302
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:33,052

303
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:35,254

♪ and God send you

307
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,437
I'm going to
call a cab.

308
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,372
Why does everyone act
like Jerry's the victim here?

309
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:54,573
He's the one
that didn't invite us

310
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,709
to his Christmas party.

311
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:59,211
- Jerry Filter!
- Jerry Filter!

312
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,663
Who's Jerry Filter?

313
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:03,466
Unsurprisingly, Jerry sends
a lot of annoying emails.

314
00:12:03,468 --> 00:12:06,085
So a while ago, I put
a filter on all our accounts.

315
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,754
Everything from Jerry
goes directly to spam.

316
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:11,590
A-a-and...

317
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:14,093
Here's our invitation.

318
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:16,295
There's three years
of nice messages on here.

319
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:17,847
"Congratulations
on your wedding.

320
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:19,982
I'm rooting for you kids.
Jerry."

321
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,484
"Hope you have
the best birthday, Tom."

322
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:24,520
I just tied my high score
in Snake.

323
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,343
Our next award
is for "Achievement in Chairs."

324
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:33,829
The nominees are:
Asa Christiana for chair,

325
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:35,831
Ron Swanson for chair,

326
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,451
- H.W. Davenport for chair.
- So exciting, Ron.

327
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,920
Okay, Ron,
this is your moment.

328
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:42,788
Tune her out.
She's not even here.

329
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,457
And the winner is...

330
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,258
Ron Swanson for chair.

331
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,328
Oh, wow! Whoo!

332
00:12:57,337 --> 00:13:01,357
This award is the only one
I'd ever give a damn about.

333
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:05,978
I made my first chair
when I was five,

334
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,064
but the quality of the wood
was wanting,

335
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:11,033
so when I turned nine,
I used my factory wages

336
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:14,019
to purchase
some beautiful local walnut.

337
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:19,191
Uh, thank you...
for this...

338
00:13:19,193 --> 00:13:22,328
Uh, this all good...
night good.

339
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,714
Uh...

340
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:26,749
There it is.

341
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:35,758
Hey, you're looking
at a picture of Millie.

342
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,893
You want to take off,
grab some vegan fries?

343
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,729
She really
was delightful.

344
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:41,880
I truly wish her
all the best.

345
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:45,518
Man, maybe going to therapy
1,000 times a week is helping.

346
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,269
I mean, if you'd seen
that picture a month ago,

347
00:13:47,271 --> 00:13:48,487
you would have
fallen apart.

348
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:50,556
It's just a picture.

349
00:13:50,558 --> 00:13:52,191
- Millie!
- Hi, mom!

350
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:55,694
We wanted to surprise you
and come home early.

351
00:13:56,998 --> 00:13:58,914
Oh, hey, Chris.

352
00:14:00,283 --> 00:14:01,534
Hi.

353
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,702
Let's take a moment now
to remember

354
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:06,088
those woodworkers
who are no longer with us,

355
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,741
and the beautiful coffins
they all designed themselves.

356
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:14,263
Hey.

357
00:14:14,265 --> 00:14:15,765
- Hey.
- Have you seen Ron?

358
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,417
He disappeared after the speech
and I can't find him anywhere.

359
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:20,919
Diane... ugh.
The stuff with Tammy

360
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:23,272
is so complex and weird
and gross.

361
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,757
It just would probably be better
if you let me handle it.

362
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,259
I'm not worried
about Tammy.

363
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:29,428
I mean, I'm a middle school
vice-principal.

364
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,730
I deal with hormonal psychopaths
all the time.

365
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:33,199
Oh, great. Good.

366
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:35,767
- What concerns me is you.
- You who?

367
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:37,403
- You you.
- You me?

368
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:38,937
You're the one who's been
at his side all night.

369
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:40,272
You're the one
who's been protecting him,

370
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:42,241
you're the one who knows
all the intimate details

371
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,043
of his romantic history
with that monster.

372
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:46,128
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Diane, you misunderstand.

373
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,713
I'm happily engaged.

374
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:50,716
You and Ron have an intimacy
that I just don't understand,

375
00:14:50,718 --> 00:14:53,052
so if there is a threat
to my relationship with Ron,

376
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:56,472
it's not Tammy.
It's you.

377
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:58,641
Okay, folks,
fasten your seatbelts.

378
00:14:58,643 --> 00:15:01,477
It's the big one:
Best Desk.

379
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,787
Where's Diane?
I need her.

380
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:08,487
- She left.
- Of course.

381
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:09,738
Tammy ruins everything.

382
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,106
No, she left
because of me.

383
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,875
She's threatened
by our relationship.

384
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:17,329
That's ridiculous.

385
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,665
I don't think of you
romantically.

386
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,000
You're pro-government,
you never stop talking,

387
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:24,303
and you have blonde hair.
You're my worst nightmare.

388
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,088
Excuse me,
one man's "worst nightmare"

389
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,974
is every other man's
"total package."

390
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,959
But the point is,
I don't think it's about dating.

391
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,128
I kind of see
where Diane is coming from.

392
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,298
We are close friends, and
I'm very involved in your life.

393
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,566
I wouldn't say
we're close.

394
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,518
By Swanson standards,
we're close.

395
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,686
I know
when your birthday is.

396
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:42,104
So does Baskin-Robbins.

397
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,573
I know that you
secretly love artichokes

398
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,408
- and plums.
- Keep your voice down, woman!

399
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:50,362
Fine, we're friends.
So what do I do?

400
00:15:50,664 --> 00:15:52,281
Tammy's waiting for me
in my car.

401
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:55,334
I think you should take my car
and go get Diane,

402
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:57,786
and I will
handle Tammy.

403
00:15:58,088 --> 00:15:59,004
Thank you.

404
00:15:59,006 --> 00:16:00,739
Protect your eyes,
she's a gouger.

405
00:16:00,841 --> 00:16:01,656
Good to know.

406
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:04,426
Chris, I'd like you
to meet my fiance, Carl.

407
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:06,094
- Well.
- Hi, there.

408
00:16:06,096 --> 00:16:08,179
Hi.
How did you two meet?

409
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,180
Whitewater rafting.

410
00:16:09,182 --> 00:16:11,049
He was
the young rafting instructor

411
00:16:11,051 --> 00:16:12,300
all the girls
were into,

412
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:13,885
and I was
the young rafting instructor

413
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:15,020
all the guys were into...

414
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:16,754
And then we got together.

415
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:18,423
Ah, so random, right?

416
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,693
What a story! I felt like
my heart was whitewater rafting.

417
00:16:21,695 --> 00:16:23,478
Well, I won't keep you guys.

418
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,779
It's good to see you.
Mwah.

419
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:27,198
Oh, little tip,
there is fat in the eggnog.

420
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,533
Okay.

421
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:31,119
So how'd it go?
You okay?

422
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:34,105
I'm fine.

423
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:35,624
If therapy
has taught me anything,

424
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:37,442
it's that I need
to face my fears,

425
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:40,128
even when my fears
are engaged to a man

426
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,797
with the chiseled jawline
of a young me.

427
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,249
Thank you, Ben.

428
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,417
Thank me?
For what?

429
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:47,619
For looking out for me
tonight.

430
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:49,137
You're a good friend.

431
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,673
Hey...

432
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,458
So Gayle and Jerry...

433
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,177
I've thought about it a lot.
There's no logical explanation.

434
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:01,516
Well, hello there,
Big B...

435
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:04,986
Gross! Leslie?
Where's Ron?

436
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:06,655
Too late, Tammy.
Ron's gone.

437
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:07,972
You'll never get him back.

438
00:17:07,974 --> 00:17:10,742
Wanna bet?
That relationship is weak.

439
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:14,162
All I have to do is find Ron
within the next few hours,

440
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:15,647
and he's toast.

441
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:18,316
Few hours, you say?

442
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:19,367
Leslie!

443
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,086
Stop this car!
Where are we going?

444
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:22,587
I don't know.

445
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,656
You're gonna
regret this!

446
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:27,459
Well, hello again.

447
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,127
You ready
to be nice to Jerry?

448
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:31,346
Because it's so cold
out here,

449
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,465
it reminds me
of my wife's lasagna.

450
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:35,333
I actually
like that one.

451
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:37,802
Hey, guys!
I thought you weren't coming.

452
00:17:37,804 --> 00:17:39,938
I... you know,
never got your RSVP.

453
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,191
Hi, Jerry. We got you a gift.
Merry Christmas.

454
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:44,476
Yeah, just...

455
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:46,511
we took up a collection
to pay your hospital bills,

456
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:49,364
since you almost
farted yourself to death.

457
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:50,815
Every time
we did something mean,

458
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:52,684
we put a dollar
in a box.

459
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:55,654
Wow. I'm the luckiest man
on earth.

460
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:58,239
Okay, well, come on in!
It's a party.

461
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:06,331
Uh...
Oh, jeez.

462
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,917
- Give me the keys!
- No!

463
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:11,169
- Give 'em to me!
- Never!

464
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:13,221
Hey,
game over, Tammy.

465
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:16,007
- What? You...!
- Ah!

466
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,709
I'm going in!

467
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:25,100
Oh, my God,
I am so turned on right now.

468
00:18:25,102 --> 00:18:26,685
What is wrong
with you?

469
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,319
Oh, yeah, tell me
you're not feeling this.

470
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:29,821
You are so crazy!

471
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:31,072
I got 'em!

472
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:32,157
- I got 'em.
- No!

473
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:34,826
- No!
- Ah!

474
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:35,994
You'll never catch me!

475
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:37,612
Come back here... Ow!

476
00:18:37,614 --> 00:18:38,780
You are not

477
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:39,864
gonna ruin this night!

478
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:41,332
- Get away from this car!
- No!

479
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:43,168
What are you doing?

480
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,536
You're crazy!

481
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:47,238
Ron! Ron!
Ha!

482
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,239
You're too late!

483
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:52,343
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

484
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:57,115
She just knows you so well,
and I was starting to wonder

485
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,933
if I was ever
gonna get to that point.

486
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,969
I'm worried
that maybe

487
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:03,188
there isn't room in your life
for another woman.

488
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,141
At this very moment,
Leslie is throwing herself

489
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:10,228
in front of a freight train
named Tammy for me and you.

490
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,781
Leslie is a wonderful,
loyal friend,

491
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:14,733
who is very important
in my life,

492
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:17,035
but I would sooner
visit Europe

493
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:19,621
than have something romantic
happen between us.

494
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:23,107
Although,
if you'd like to visit Europe,

495
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:25,577
I like you so much,
I'd be willing to risk it.

496
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:28,379
But not France,
right?

497
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,414
God, no.

498
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:34,085
See? You know me
pretty well already,

499
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:37,222
but you're about to
get to know me even better.

500
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:39,891
I brought you here because
I want to show you something

501
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:41,760
that almost no one
knows about...

502
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:45,313
certainly not Tammy,
and not even Leslie Knope.

503
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:48,900
Ladies and gentleman,
and especially the ladies,

504
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:52,070
put your hands together
for the one, the only,

505
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:55,139
my man,
Mr. Duke Silver.

506
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:01,863
A mighty fine holiday evening
to you all.

507
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:05,116
- Yeah.
- It might be cold outside,

508
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:08,453
but it's about to get warm
all up in my jazz.

509
00:20:09,456 --> 00:20:11,506
I, of course,
am Duke Silver,

510
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:14,492
and I would like
to dedicate this first song...

511
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:15,827
To my duchess.

512
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,184
You're so lucky.

513
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:27,722
I'm going to kill you.

514
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:36,180
I think it's time
to officially retire

515
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:39,183
as Ron's emotional guardian.
That's Diane's job now,

516
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:41,519
and she seems
more than up to the task.

517
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:44,205
I mean,
I'd do anything for Ron...

00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:47,692
even spend a whole night
fighting his crazy ex-wife.

519
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:51,696
But I think I'm safe.
She's gotta be tired by now.

520
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:52,714
Hi.

- Officer Skorggel.
- I pulled over

523
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:05,637
a Tammy Swanson
for driving erratically.

524
00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:07,455
Ran the plates,
saw it was your car.

525
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,957
Figured it was stolen.

526
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:10,926
Hey, Ron, why don't you
get me out of these handcuffs,

527
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:13,428
so I can put you
into these handcuffs.

528
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,831
Yes, please officer,
get her out of those cuffs.

529
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:17,265
I want this
to be a fair fight.

530
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:20,769
Officer, did you see
any sign of a passenger?

531
00:21:22,187 --> 00:21:23,271
Ron!

532
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:24,339
There we go.

533
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:26,024
Hey!

534
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:30,424
Help.
