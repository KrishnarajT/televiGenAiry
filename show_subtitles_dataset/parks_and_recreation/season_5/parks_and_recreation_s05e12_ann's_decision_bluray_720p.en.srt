1
00:00:01,986 --> 00:00:05,238
I'm gonna get 12 eggs
and part of a dead animal.

2
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,038
Dealer's choice.
Please and thank you.

3
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,239
What can I get you, Ann?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,341
I will have oatmeal
and berries.

5
00:00:10,842 --> 00:00:13,675
And I will have catfish
and grits,

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,111
with pumpernickel toast.

7
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:16,179
Explain.

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,530
Well, instead
of getting swept up

9
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:19,332
in my boyfriends'
personalities,

10
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,068
I am dating myself
and trying new things.

11
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,236
So every time
I go out to eat,

12
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:25,438
I order one thing
that's typical me

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,773
and then something
that I would never order.

14
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:29,608
Now I have two best friends,
Ann and Ann.

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,142
Each one more beautiful
than the other.

16
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:32,777
Oh, I also
have been documenting

17
00:00:32,778 --> 00:00:35,314
all the new things I'm trying
on my blog.

18
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:36,315
Check this out.

19
00:00:36,316 --> 00:00:37,716
I went skydiving.

20
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:40,952
Which Ann is screaming
like a maniac?

21
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:43,589
Oatmeal Ann or catfish Ann?

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,590
I'm not sure,
because I instantly blacked out

23
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:46,657
from extreme terror.

24
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:56,597

25
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:12,014
Hey, I have an idea
for your blog.

26
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:13,483
I think you should
take yourself ice-skating.

27
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:14,618
That sounds fun.

28
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:15,619
Yeah, we'll do a double date:

29
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,752
You and you,
and me and Ben.

30
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:17,786
But I have to warn you,

31
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:18,787
I'm very good at ice-skating.

32
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,021
I can do jumps.

33
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:21,156
You know what?
I probably shouldn't come.

34
00:01:21,157 --> 00:01:22,758
I'll embarrass
the both of you.

35
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,826
Actually, I know what
my next activity is gonna be.

36
00:01:24,827 --> 00:01:27,129
And it's a biggie.

37
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,297
I want to be a mom.

38
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:30,366
I'm going
to the sperm bank today.

39
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,667
Can you come?

40
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:32,833
Wow, today?

41
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:35,870
Ann, you know
that I fully support

42
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,338
any woman's decision...

43
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:40,107
especially a beautiful
unicorn-nurse like yourself...

44
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,343
in creating the family
that she wants.

45
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:44,979
But you are so brilliant
and kind and stupid hot.

46
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,213
I mean,
you're definitely gonna find

47
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:48,382
a wonderful guy
who loves you and respects you

48
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:50,984
and fills your home
with multi-ethnic genius babies.

49
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,253
Maybe,
or maybe not.

50
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:56,222
You hit the lottery with Ben,
and that's great,

51
00:01:56,223 --> 00:01:58,224
but not everybody's so lucky.

52
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,693
I've wanted to be a mom
for a long time,

53
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:01,728
I'm ready, and I think
I'd be good at it.

54
00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:04,164
Ann is giving up on love

55
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,931
and deciding
to have a baby with herself.

56
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:08,434
And she has only been
dating herself for six weeks.

57
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,770
If she were dating a guy
for six weeks,

58
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:12,271
and they decided
to have a kid,

59
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:14,407
I'd be like,
"Congratulations, Ann...

60
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:16,041
And Channing Tatum."

61
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:17,376
Because that is
the only scenario

62
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:19,011
that would make sense to me.

63
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:22,113
What a gorgeous
herbaceous medley.

64
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:23,581
There's been a mistake.

65
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:26,851
You've accidentally given me
the food that my food eats.

66
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:28,720
Salad is traditionally
the first course at a wedding.

67
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:31,088
Is a gerbil marrying
a rabbit?

68
00:02:31,089 --> 00:02:32,757
I'm in charge of food
for the wedding.

69
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:35,360
So I brought in
Pawnee's three best caterers

70
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:37,461
and a panel of experts.

71
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:39,262
Chris loves vegetables.

72
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:40,964
Ron loves meat.

73
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:43,767
And Tom considers himself
a foodie,

74
00:02:43,768 --> 00:02:46,470
which apparently means
taking instagrams of food

75
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:47,604
instead of eating it.

76
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:50,140
Okay, so I liked number one,

77
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:51,442
Chris liked number two,

78
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,843
and Ron liked number three.

79
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:55,578
Tom, what about you?

80
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:58,280
Caterer number one's
presentation was simple,

81
00:02:58,281 --> 00:02:59,682
mm, yet exhausting.

82
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:03,016
Number two's was subtle
and provocative,

83
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,421
like a coy Dutch woman
guarding a dark secret.

84
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:07,056
Nothing you're saying
is helpful.

85
00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:09,224
But number three's told
a story...

86
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:11,660
a story from a book
I wouldn't read

87
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:13,862
but I would watch
the movie of.

88
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:15,096
That's nonsense.

89
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:16,531
You know what?

90
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:17,866
I'm gonna go
with the first place.

91
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,368
I really loved that appetizer.

92
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:20,535
Oh, the mini-calzone?

93
00:03:20,536 --> 00:03:21,603
I wouldn't call it that.

94
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:23,338
It was more like
a savory pastry.

95
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:25,506
Delicate little dough pocket

96
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:28,642
filled with tomato sauce,
cheese, and seasoned meat.

97
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:30,944
Just a stunning
culinary innovation.

98
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,546
It was a calzone.

99
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,582
It was literally
just a small calzone.

100
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,084
Let me just get some details
for your file.

101
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:38,352
Now, are you two a couple?

102
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:41,053
No. Tragically,
we are both heterosexual.

103
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,089
So, Ann, what
are you looking for

104
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,557
in particular?

105
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,726
Some sperm.

106
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,294
I meant
in terms of a donor?

107
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,848
Oh, you know, nice guy...
Nice sperm.

108
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,132
Flip through this binder,

109
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,834
make a note
of anyone who interests you,

110
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:57,302
and I'll be back shortly.

111
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,037
Oh!
This guy went to Harvard!

112
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,138
So did the Unabomber.

113
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,172
This guys seems healthy.

114
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:02,173
Loves cycling.

115
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:03,642
Yeah, so did Lance Armstrong,

116
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,277
and he turned out
to be a lying drug user.

117
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,478
Or a hero.

118
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,079
I don't know where we stand
on him now.

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,114
Hello, ladies.

120
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,315
Fancy meeting you here.

121
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,450
Whoa, Sewage Joe.

122
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,251
Wow. Ann, you remember
Joe Fantringham.

123
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,387
He is the gentleman
who was fired

124
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:17,722
for emailing
a picture of his penis

125
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:18,790
to every woman in city hall.

126
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,990
Guilty.

127
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:21,526
Yeah, that's what
the judge said.

128
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,094
- Mmhmm.
- Joe, you are a donor here, huh?

129
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:25,195
Did you hear that, Ann?

130
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:26,697
Big time,
me and all my buddies.

131
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,632
Free money, free porn.

132
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,233
Best job I ever had.

133
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:31,635
Also...

134
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:33,804
If you're looking
to buy some weed,

135
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,005
I'm looking as well.

136
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:38,744
- Shall we?
- Yup.

137
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:43,647
Okay, Leslie Knope outfit
number eight.

138
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,514
Babe, you look super hot.

139
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:47,650
You realize you've said that
about all of them?

140
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,818
Well, she has,
every single time.

141
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,486
'Cause she is super hot.

142
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,755
Honestly,
you'd look hot naked.

143
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:56,089
Ugh. This suit makes me want
to scold a Catholic child.

144
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:58,494
I don't know who Ann Taylor is,

145
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,995
but I hate her
and I want to kill her.

146
00:04:59,996 --> 00:05:02,997
I have to lead a public forum
for the Pawnee Commons

147
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,298
every day this week,

148
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,901
and I hate talking to people.

149
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:08,135
So, to get through it,

150
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:09,838
I figured
I'm just gonna basically try

151
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,038
to imitate Leslie.

152
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,341
She still wears this.

153
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:14,742
She had the patch sewn in.

154
00:05:14,743 --> 00:05:16,444
You can't remove it.

155
00:05:16,445 --> 00:05:18,345
What's in the pocket, you ask?

156
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:21,679
A ticket stub from
a Fleetwood Mac concert in 1995,

157
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:23,185
and...

158
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:26,587
This one is terrible,

159
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:29,255
but it is slightly less terrible
than the rest.

160
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:32,092
So tomorrow,
I lead a public forum

161
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,026
in Leslie's Fleetwood Mac
sex pants.

162
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:36,261
Fleetwood Mac Sex Pants.
New band name. I call it.

163
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:37,597
Ooh, you know what?

164
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:40,931
Maybe just Fleetwood Mac.

165
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,535
So what's the next move?

166
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:44,036
Is there, like,
a better sperm bank

167
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:45,337
in Eagleton or something?

168
00:05:45,338 --> 00:05:46,839
Um, you don't want
a demon baby.

169
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,040
Look, you're Ann Perkins.

170
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,708
Sperm that is worthy
of your perfect eggs

171
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,042
does not grow on trees.

172
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,443
I think, ideally,

173
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:54,579
you'd want
to know the guy, right?

174
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,047
You'd want
to know his personality,

175
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:58,082
his favorite season
of Friends,

176
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,951
whether or not he hates jazz...
hopefully, he does.

177
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,119
You'd want to know him.

178
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,988
Yes, Leslie,
you're totally right.

179
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:04,322
I'm gonna go home,

180
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,689
and I'm gonna make a list

181
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,958
of all the guys I already know
who could be donors.

182
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,827
And then,
I'm gonna call them

183
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:10,995
and tell them
I'm doing some blog entry

184
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,830
on men's health or something.

185
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,798
I can interview them
and ask them whatever I want.

186
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,099
You're a genius!

187
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,134
This is your idea,
and I love it.

188
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:18,168
I'll call you later.

189
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,770
No.

190
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:21,604
If I don't slow
this baby train down,

191
00:06:21,605 --> 00:06:24,140
Ann may end up having a baby
with some random weirdo

192
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,408
instead of her soul mate.

193
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,475
I fully believe

194
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:27,610
that a woman
should be in charge

195
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:29,045
of what happens
to her body.

196
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:31,180
In this case,
the body is Ann's,

197
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:33,416
and the woman
in charge of it is me.

198
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,759
I was up all night brainstorming

199
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,559
and this is
the complete official list

200
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,896
of candidates
for Ann's baby daddy.

201
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:43,231
Wow, how did you come up
with these three names?

202
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:45,617
Well, I eliminated everyone
in a relationship

203
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:46,817
and the obvious "No" s,

204
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:48,886
like Knuckle-hair Dave
from HR.

205
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,021
I don't mind the knuckle hair.

206
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,622
- I just think he's a dick.
- Yeah.

207
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,624
And I was left
with those three guys.

208
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,592
Don't forget, they don't know
about the sperm donor thing.

209
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:56,926
I don't want them to know.

210
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:58,662
I told them I was
interviewing them for a blog.

211
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:00,164
Here comes the first one.
Dr. Harris!

212
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,165
- H-hey, there he is.
- Hi.

213
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,633
Ann, Leslie.

214
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:04,501
Small office.
Mine's way bigger.

215
00:07:04,502 --> 00:07:06,970
Is this gonna take long?
Got a patient coming in.

216
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:09,338
No, not at all.
Please have a seat.

217
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,040
Actually, maybe you should
check in on your patient.

218
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,075
I know that I hate it
when my doctor makes me wait.

219
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:14,310
Guy's got a spinal fracture.

220
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:15,344
He's not going anywhere.

221
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:16,979
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh.

222
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,847
The seats in my office
are leather.

223
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,849
Okay.

224
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:25,887
Chris?

225
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:27,889
I'm dying.

226
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,591
I was dying earlier today.

227
00:07:30,092 --> 00:07:31,726
And then I died.

228
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:33,427
Now I'm dead.

229
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:34,696
I had to cancel a date

230
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:36,398
with Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

231
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,699
And I really like her.

232
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,202
Do you think
she'll still like me

233
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,235
now that I'm dead?

234
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:42,836
What is this?

235
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,939
It's food poisoning.
I have it too.

236
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,959
I did not sleep
for one second last night.

237
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,027
And I cracked the bottom
of the toilet bowl.

238
00:07:51,028 --> 00:07:52,628
Oh, God, don't say that.

239
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:54,296
Has anybody talked to Tom?

240
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:55,765
I can't even imagine

241
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,100
what that tiny little man
must be feeling like.

242
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,702
I have voided more
than Tom's body weight

243
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:01,971
in the last 12 hours alone.

244
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,806
He might have just disappeared
off the earth.

245
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:06,609
We need to call him.
We must reach out to him.

246
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:12,380
I can't do it.

247
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:25,759
Ben, extension 7820.

248
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:38,873
Hello, everyone.

249
00:08:38,874 --> 00:08:41,273
I'm April Ludgate
from the Parks Department.

250
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:45,507
And welcome to a public forum
about the Pawnee Commons.

251
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,381
As Eleanor Roosevelt once said

252
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:51,283
to Betty Ford...

253
00:08:51,284 --> 00:08:53,152
"Hillary Clinton is great."

254
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:56,986
Now, if you all would
kindly look under your chairs,

255
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:59,357
you will find
a special surprise...

256
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,827
a flyer with details
about the project,

257
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:04,229
and... Friendship bands

258
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,532
that I've made
for each and every one of you.

259
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,835
So now,
I guess we're Park Pals.

260
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,602
You should see the booger
under this chair.

261
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:13,004
Andy.

262
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,239
It's nice
to see you again, Ann.

263
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,407
I was happy to get the call.

264
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,709
- Yeah, Pete, you look great.
- Aww.

265
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,345
So are you still
dunking basketballs?

266
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:22,947
You know, I'm a lot more

267
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:25,149
than just a former
high school basketball star.

268
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,884
I teach marketing over
at Pawnee Community College.

269
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:29,719
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

270
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,053
Would you say
you value education?

271
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,359
I see what's going on here.

272
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,928
You want my sperm.

273
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:40,463
What?
What are you talking about?

274
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:41,598
When will women
in this town

275
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,433
stop scheming
to get my sperm?

276
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:45,801
Wow.

277
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:48,037
That son of a bitch is astute.

278
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:49,404
Okay, all I need to do

279
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:51,139
is just shoot
one more person down

280
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,474
and then I can
buy some time

281
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:55,808
and convince Ann to wait
for her own Ben-level soul mate.

282
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,114
The last guy
is Howard Tuttleman.

283
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:00,514
I know that name.

284
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:01,983
How do I know that name?

285
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:03,417
I know it's a winter's morn,

286
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:05,152
but it feels
like a summer's eve,

287
00:10:05,153 --> 00:10:07,822
'cause "the douche"
is in the building.

288
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:10,825
What's up, ladies?

289
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:14,562
Oh, whoa!

290
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:16,329
Smells like some vomit
took a dump in here.

291
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,363
What happened?

292
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,165
We got food poisoning, Tom.

293
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,233
Yuck.

294
00:10:20,234 --> 00:10:22,168
How do you
not have food poisoning?

295
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,971
Because he didn't eat
anything.

296
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:25,238
He just took pictures

297
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,407
and talked
about the "wow" factor.

298
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:29,042
Not true.
I ate everything you did.

299
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:30,243
Are you sure?

300
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:31,911
Is there anything
that you didn't eat?

301
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,145
Oh, yeah.

302
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,346
I didn't eat
those stupid mini-calzones.

303
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:36,782
Haver-food rule number six...

304
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,985
never eat anything with
a sauce I have to dip myself.

305
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,385
Drizzle it on for me.

306
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,954
I'm not your maid.

307
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,957
The calzones... betrayed me?

308
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,492
Never again, guys.

309
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:48,526
As God as my witness,

310
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:49,828
they're dead to me.

311
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,997
All right, well,
Tommy feels great.

312
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,099
And I'm about
to go eat some lasagna.

313
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,266
Peace!

314
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,138
I'm afraid this park
will raise my taxes.

315
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,840
Ah, well, fear not.

316
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,141
Between the normal Parks budget
and our corporate partners...

317
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,476
- I'm also afraid
the park will be noisy.

318
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:07,945
And full of spiders.

319
00:11:07,946 --> 00:11:09,346
And dark at nighttime.

320
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:11,448
I'm scared of a lot of stuff.

321
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,117
Everything's fine.

322
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:15,318
I'm fine.
I'm Walter, and I'm fine.

323
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:17,387
Is this gonna be
a topless park?

324
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:20,156
I don't think there are
topless parks.

325
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:22,025
Well, let's build
the first one

326
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,660
and be heroes.

327
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:25,227
If this is going to be
a topless park,

328
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:27,030
I won't sign your petition.

329
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,765
If she's going
to the topless park,

330
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:32,099
I'm not signing
the topless park petition.

331
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:34,704
You know, I take that back,
I'm still in.

332
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:36,237
What's up?
I'm Harris.

333
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,107
Yeah, yeah. Forget whatever
that Pawnee Commons is.

334
00:11:39,108 --> 00:11:40,241
I'm with that pervert.

335
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,510
Topless park.
Topless park!

336
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:45,313
- Topless park!
- Topless park!

337
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:47,015
Where'd you go
to school again?

338
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:49,250
Northwestern.
I studied semiotics.

339
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,252
Wrote a thesis on narrative
forms in the digital world.

340
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,854
Then you became
a morning shock-jock

341
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:56,957
and created
the sport "taint ball"?

342
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,592
Yeah. You know,
the douche persona

343
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,394
is something I came up with
during college.

344
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:02,229
It started as satire,

345
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,098
and, you know, we snowballed
to where we are today.

346
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,700
I mean, I know it's
a silly thing to do,

347
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,201
but it pays the bills.

348
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,668
Well, I think, you probably
need to get back to the studio,

349
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,370
play some fart jokes,
make fun of some immigrants.

350
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:14,373
Actually, a farting immigrant
segment would be really funny.

351
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:15,975
Ay dios...

352
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:18,344
Good looking out, Leslie.

353
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:19,979
You guys ever want
to do this again,

354
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,948
sans clothing,
give me a shout.

355
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,849
- Gross.
- That was the douche talking.

356
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,617
Honestly, good luck
on this project.

357
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:27,385
It sounds really interesting.

358
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:28,987
I'm gonna scan a quick pic
of them boobies

359
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:32,157
for a little deposit
in "El banco de spanko."

360
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:33,692
That was the douche talking.

361
00:12:33,693 --> 00:12:34,960
Douche nation.

362
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,929
You guys know
where the library is?

363
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,131
Wow.
Okay, that's not gonna work.

364
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:40,598
Back to the drawing board.

365
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,266
No need.
I choose Howard.

366
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,102
You want to have a baby
with the douche?

367
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:45,970
His name's Howard Tuttleman,
Leslie.

368
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,106
And I know he plays
that obnoxious character

369
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:49,907
on the radio,
but he's a good guy,

370
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:51,442
his family is healthy,

371
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:53,310
and he is successful
and smart.

372
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:54,979
Ann, you cannot be serious.

373
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,047
I am.
And I've made my decision.

374
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:59,750
- I am sure of it.
Okay.

375
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:01,952
Douche!
Hey, douche!

376
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:03,653
Councilman Howser.

377
00:13:03,654 --> 00:13:05,155
Councilwoman Knope.

378
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,623
'Sup, Leslie?

379
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:09,226
You wanna funk this junk
in the back of my trunk?

380
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:10,994
That was the douche talking.

381
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:13,129
Okay, look,
Ann is not interviewing you

382
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,463
for her blog.

383
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:15,865
She's thinking
about having a baby,

384
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:18,968
and she's considering you
as a possible donor.

385
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:19,969
Wow.

386
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:23,605
You know, I've thought a lot
about having kids.

387
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:25,207
It's the next big step

388
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,442
in this grand adventure
that we call life.

389
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:28,542
Frankly, I don't think
you would be

390
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:29,644
the right man for the job.

391
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:30,812
Well, frankly,

392
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:31,913
I don't think
it's for you to decide.

393
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:33,547
You know, if we had
a little girl,

394
00:13:33,548 --> 00:13:35,349
I would name her Elizabeth,
after my grandmother.

395
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,452
She was this strong,
amazing woman.

396
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,321
And if we had a boy,

397
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:41,589
I don't know,
I'd name him something funny,

398
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,491
like "Dick" or "O. J."

399
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:46,126
Guess I have
a lot to consider.

400
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:47,345
My God.

401
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:50,831
I have driven Ann right
into the belly of the douche.

402
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,632
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh, nothing.

403
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:54,733
I was listening
to the radio

404
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:55,934
on my way here,

405
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,002
and I heard something
very interesting.

406
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,870
So, Crazy Ira,

407
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,339
remember that chick Ann
I used to...

408
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,326
Yeah, she was smoking hot!

409
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:10,130
Turns out, she wants
to have my baby.

410
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,100
Anyway, her lesbo friend
tells me

411
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:15,369
she's on the prowl
for some baby beans...

412
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:19,206
And it's down to me
and some other turd-munchers.

413
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,343
Wow.
You should be angry.

414
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:24,978
I can't believe
Howard did that to you.

415
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:27,848
I can't believe
you did that to me.

416
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:30,584
I am making
a very important life decision,

417
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:32,151
and you betrayed me.

418
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,553
Because I thought
you were making a huge mistake.

419
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:34,788
Look, I get it.

420
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:36,022
I know you're frustrated
with dating,

421
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:37,591
and you think you're
not gonna meet someone,

422
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:39,424
but two years ago,
I didn't think

423
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,026
I would meet someone like Ben,
and I did.

424
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,427
My idea of a perfect family

425
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:44,797
does not require a soul mate.

426
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:47,633
I want a baby, that's it,
accept it.

427
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,736
Councilman Milton,
do we have a meeting?

428
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,004
Oh, no, no, no.

429
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,539
I just wanted to toss
my name into the ring,

430
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,873
in respect
to this Indian woman's vagina.

431
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:02,480
Hey, how was the forum?

432
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,281
Um, crappy.

433
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:06,317
We only got four signatures.

434
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:07,652
Two of them were me and Andy,

435
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,988
and one of them
said "Farts McCool."

436
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:12,523
I just don't know
how Leslie can be Leslie

437
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:13,690
all the time.

438
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:17,024
I was her for two hours
and I want to die.

439
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:18,461
Well, you know what?

440
00:15:18,462 --> 00:15:19,897
We've got another forum today.

441
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:21,999
Let's just hop back
in that saddle.

442
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,934
What should I do?
Should I wear a blonde wig?

443
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:25,002
Oh, my God, yes.

444
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,503
- That would be so hot.
- Andy.

445
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:29,038
If you think... if you...
do you think it would help?

446
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,306
I mean, if you think
it'd help you.

447
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:34,343
Well, I'm feeling
so much better.

448
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:37,379
Almost no weird stuff snuck out
of my body last night.

449
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,114
And I feel like the emptiness
of my stomach

450
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:40,816
is gonna lead
to a pretty epic breakfast.

451
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,018
Guys, what do I do?

452
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,818
My choice almost killed us,

453
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,154
and we can't agree
on another one, so...

454
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,722
Maybe there's
a catering company

455
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:50,025
in Snerling
that we should look into.

456
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:51,726
No, it has to be
from Pawnee.

457
00:15:51,727 --> 00:15:52,827
I just know
that's what Leslie wants.

458
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:53,828
I got it.

459
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,163
This might sound crazy,

460
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:58,299
but Jean-Ralphio has started
a catering company.

461
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,733
He has?

462
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:00,968
Now, granted,
he is currently

463
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:02,302
standing trial
for counterfeiting Euros,

464
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,572
but the trial's
gonna be over quick.

465
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:05,806
He's definitely guilty.

466
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:07,139
Ugh, forget it.

467
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,443
Dry toast
and half a grapefruit for Chris.

468
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:11,544
Thank you.

469
00:16:11,545 --> 00:16:12,845
- Egg whites for Ben.
- Thank you.

470
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,814
Egg whites for Tom,

471
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:18,148
and pretty much
everything we make for Ron.

472
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,418
And don't you go sneaking off.

473
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:22,055
I'm sending home
some free waffles for Leslie.

474
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,489
Thanks, JJ.
You're the best.

475
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:28,460
Okay, we're back.

476
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:31,463
We, uh, got an update
on "Operation...

477
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:32,864
Baby douche."

478
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:37,566
All right, special guest
is Councilwoman Leslie Knope.

479
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:39,837
- How are you, les?
- "Me so horny."

480
00:16:39,838 --> 00:16:40,871
That was not me.

481
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:41,939
That was
a farcical sound effect.

482
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,440
Did she say "fartsicle"?

483
00:16:44,843 --> 00:16:48,045
The fartsicle.
Frozen farts you can eat.

484
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:50,881
Put it in your face-mouth!

485
00:16:50,882 --> 00:16:52,883
It's cold and it smells.

486
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:54,618
God, how did you make that
so fast?

487
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:56,319
Anyway, look, I am here

488
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,420
because I want you
to stop talking

489
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:59,255
about my friend's womb.

490
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:00,757
Sorry, Councilwoman.
I'm in it to win it.

491
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,191
The douche is gonna be
a daddy.

492
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:05,525
And Crazy Ira's gonna be
the creepy Uncle.

493
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,063
Okay, all right.

494
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:08,832
Look, she is
a wonderful person,

495
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,133
and she does not
deserve this.

496
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:11,233
So I need you to lay off.

497
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:12,968
Okay, I will lay off

498
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:16,302
if you can survive one round
with Breasty Bertha in...

499
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,374
The Jell-o Pit!

500
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,210
Rudy! Get in the Jell-o.

501
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:24,146
Okay, I am
a city councilwoman,

502
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:25,247
so I am not gonna
Jell-o wrestle.

503
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:26,448
I mean, this is fun.

504
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:27,715
Don't you want
your constituents to know

505
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,050
that you got a fun side?

506
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,785
Yeah, show your fun sides.

507
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:32,386
This is not about me
and my constituents!

508
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:34,188
This is about you talking
about my friend.

509
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:36,124
All right, I will stop talking
about your friend

510
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,792
if you get in that Jell-o
for one second

511
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:39,093
- and say, "Rudy."
- Rudy.

512
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:41,062
- 'Cause The Cosby Show.
- Classic.

513
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:42,363
Classic.

514
00:17:42,364 --> 00:17:44,031
Fine, I will stand there
for one second

515
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:45,198
and say it,
and then we're done.

516
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,566
- Fair's fair.
- Fair's fair.

517
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,568
Somebody get me
a pudding pop.

518
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,602
Oh!

519
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,773
Yeah!

520
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:53,907
Rudy.

521
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:55,108
There, happy?

522
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:58,442
No, say it like Bill Cosby.

523
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:01,113
Rudy.

524
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,948
- I don't know.
- Yeah!

525
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,550
Oh, she's touching
her boobs now.

526
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,351
No, I'm not.
I'm just standing here.

527
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,721
And I am leaving, just like
you're gonna leave Ann alone.

528
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,623
Oh, she's in there!

529
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:12,792
She's into it now!

530
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:14,359
Oh, Rudy has fallen
into the Jell-o.

531
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,461
Theo, now there's Jell-o

532
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,664
all over
my favorite sweater.

533
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,932
And the gold medal

534
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,902
goes to Leslie Knope!

535
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,403
Okay, can you give me
that bag?

536
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,105
I have to go change
into my Leslie suit.

537
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,007
You got it, babe.

538
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,175
Thanks.

539
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,843
Andy!

540
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,511
- What?
- This is the wrong bag.

541
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:35,746
What?

542
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,780
This bag is full
of Fruit Roll-Ups

543
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:37,915
and baseball cards.

544
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,817
I don't have
my Leslie pantsuit

545
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,685
or my Leslie headband
or my Leslie notes.

546
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,887
I can't do this meeting
without my Leslie stuff.

547
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:45,488
- Honey, I am so sorry.
- Andy!

548
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:46,590
I guess
I must have screwed up.

549
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,224
Look, you look amazing
in this outfit.

550
00:18:48,225 --> 00:18:50,827
Plus you're the smartest person
on the planet.

551
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:52,428
I think you can do this
just being yourself.

552
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:57,834
Yeah, so how much money

553
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:00,903
is this whole Pawnee Commons
project gonna cost me?

554
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:02,205
Uh, good question.

555
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:05,340
40% will be coming
from our corporate partners,

556
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:07,275
- and another 30%...
- Excuse me, ma'am.

557
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,944
I didn't ask
for a math lesson.

558
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:11,412
So why don't you just tell me
how much it's gonna cost me?

559
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:14,482
And don't use numbers.

560
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,085
Look, you won't have
to pay any extra money, okay?

561
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:18,919
And don't ever
call me "ma'am" again.

562
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,955
Thanks.
Next question.

563
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:23,590
Yeah, I wanted to talk more
about that topless park idea

564
00:19:23,591 --> 00:19:25,760
that a local hero
brought up yesterday.

565
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:27,228
Yeah, there's not gonna be
a topless park, Harris.

566
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,296
Nobody wants
your creepy stoner eyes

567
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:31,031
staring at them while
they're enjoying a park, okay?

568
00:19:31,032 --> 00:19:33,300
Stop being gross.

569
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:35,135
Yeah.

570
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,870
Shut me down!

571
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,138
You scare me,

572
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:41,040
and I gotta say,
I kinda dig that.

573
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,308
What's your deal?

574
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:44,644
She's married to me.

575
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:46,512
I heard you on the radio.

576
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:48,648
- Thanks for doing that.
- Got dicey.

577
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:50,583
But they did invite me
to participate

578
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,484
in their
topless Jell-o-lympics...

579
00:19:52,485 --> 00:19:54,820
- Oh.
- So that's something.

580
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:57,823
It is possible
that you were right.

581
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:01,026
This is obviously
a huge decision,

582
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:03,228
and I should take my time.

583
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:04,696
I want you
to be happy, you know?

584
00:20:04,697 --> 00:20:06,031
I-I guess I just didn't consider

585
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:07,298
that you would take
a different path than I did.

586
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:09,667
I tried
to impose my dream on you,

587
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:10,968
and that's wrong.

588
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,036
And I'm sorry.

589
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,404
But I think you do need

590
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:14,906
to take a little bit more time
with this decision.

591
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:17,108
Maybe employ
a more methodical approach.

592
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:20,442
One that involves
color-coded binders.

593
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,879
Is that a drawing

594
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,648
of my reproductive system
saying "Let's do this"?

595
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:28,484
The Knope way involves
a lot of uterine cartoons.

596
00:20:28,485 --> 00:20:29,519
What can I tell you?

597
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,421
Besides,
what is more cuter-us

598
00:20:31,422 --> 00:20:32,823
than your uterus?

599
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:34,925
- You ready, Ann?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

600
00:20:34,926 --> 00:20:36,492
- We're in it now.
- Yes, we are.

601
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:37,627
Let's make a baby together.

602
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:39,361
You should phrase that
differently.

603
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:40,395
Right.

604
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:43,359
Are you sure you're cool
with JJ's Diner

605
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,927
catering what
you've referred to

606
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:46,595
as "The wedding
of the millennium"?

607
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:48,329
Are you kidding me?

608
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,931
I thought that I could not love
you any more than I already did.

609
00:20:50,932 --> 00:20:52,368
But I was dead wrong.

610
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,552
- Is that smoke?
- Hmm?

611
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,208
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Celebrating.

612
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,877
We got 80 signatures
and, like, 30 complaints

613
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:05,512
of excessive rudeness,
but who cares?

614
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,180
Yeah, you should have
seen her, Leslie.

615
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:10,016
She was awesome.
So smart, so hot, so mean.

616
00:21:10,017 --> 00:21:12,551
I wanted to bone her right there
in that dirty church basement.

617
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:14,070
No, what are you doing?

618
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:17,404
Uh, we are burning
this awful pantsuit.

619
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:18,575
That's mine.

620
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:19,909
I wanted that back.

621
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,110
Well, frankly,
you should have thought of that

622
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:23,779
before we burned it.

623
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,300
