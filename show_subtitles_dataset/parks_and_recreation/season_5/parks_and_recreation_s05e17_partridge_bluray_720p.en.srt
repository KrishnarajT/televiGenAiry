1
00:00:20,872 --> 00:00:24,138
I'm looking for Ronald Ulysses Swanson?

2
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:26,939
He stepped out.
Can I take a message?

3
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,713
Sure. Tell him
he just won a free dinner

4
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,057
from St. Elmo steak house.

5
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:33,744
I'm Ron Swanson!

6
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:36,618
You've been served.
Have a nice day.

7
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,461
I don't like you.

8
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:40,241
But I respect the effort.

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,572
Oh, man, subpoena?

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,571
Which ex-wife is it,
Tammy one or Tammy two?

11
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:44,917
Neither.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,598
Apparently councilman
Jeremy Jamm is not pleased

13
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:50,455
that I punched him in the face
on the night of Leslie's wedding.

14
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:51,765
He's suing me.

15
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:54,525
$13,000
for orthodontic surgery,

16
00:00:54,544 --> 00:00:56,248
$6,000 for enamel repair,

17
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:59,407
and $46 million
for psychological damages.

18
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:01,031
Yeah, that seems
about accurate.

19
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:02,900
That guy is the worst.

20
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:04,391
We should sue Jamm's parents

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,371
for spawning
a human turdburger.

22
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:08,249
Ron, hey,
let me be your lawyer.

23
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:09,882
I'll object
to everything anyone says,

24
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,954
trial will go on forever,
you don't have to pay.

25
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,202
Problem solved.

26
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:14,341
That's a kind offer, Andrew,

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,129
but I won't be hiring
an attorney.

28
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:17,626
I'll represent myself,

29
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:20,584
as I do in all legal matters
and livestock auctions.

30
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:23,257
I wish we had $46 million.

31
00:01:23,293 --> 00:01:25,114
We could buy my parents' house
and evict them.

32
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,348
Surprised he's taking it
this well.

33
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,520
Aghh!

34
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:32,967
April, could you
call maintenance please?

35
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:49,625
Parks and Recreation
S05E17
Partridge

36
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:54,669
Sync and corrections by Norther
www.addic7ed.com

37
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,325
Okay, move a little bit
to your left

38
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,786
and then turn to the side.

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,088
Okay, and freeze.

40
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:03,024
That is the exact spot

41
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,635
where an 18-year-old
Ben Wyatt was inaugurated

42
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:07,164
as mayor of Partridge,
Minnesota.

43
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:09,834
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Yes, congratulations to you.

44
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:11,034
- I don't know.
- I have chills.

45
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:13,184
Can't believe they're finally
giving me the key to the city.

46
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:14,992
I can't believe
it took so long.

47
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:17,712
They gave the key to every other
mayor in the town's history,

48
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:20,411
and I guarantee that none of them
had as cute a butt as you do.

49
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:23,936
And none of them caused the city's
unemployment rate to hit 30%.

50
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:26,286
You're so sexy when you talk
about percentages.

51
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:29,058
When Ben was mayor,
he sunk all of the town's money

52
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:31,919
into a winter sports complex
called "Ice Town,"

53
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,276
and they went bankrupt.

54
00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:36,154
Now they've invited him back
as a gesture of goodwill,

55
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:39,638
and he'll finally get some closure
on this miserable chapter in his life.

56
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,280
Yay, Ben!

57
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,230
Town hero!

58
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:45,116
- Yes!
- Whoo!

59
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:50,469
Well, if it isn't
the defendant, Ron Swansuck.

60
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,607
Why are you doing this, Jamm?

61
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,474
This lawsuit is
Chronicles of Riddick-ulous.

62
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:55,330
I'll tell you why.

63
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,869
It's 'cause I'm sick of
this whole Parks and Rec gang.

64
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:58,701
That's why.

65
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:01,099
This munch throws me
into a swimming pool.

66
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,984
The nurse still
won't have sex with me,

67
00:03:02,996 --> 00:03:04,316
and she's not even queer.

68
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:06,538
Now Swansuck punches me
in the mouth.

69
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,243
It's what we
in the Jamm family call...

70
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:10,196
"Payback time."

71
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:11,246
Everyone calls it that.

72
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,869
Yeah, because I invented it.

73
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:15,518
Yeah, you're not gonna win
$50 million, you freak.

74
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:16,487
Maybe not,

75
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:19,812
but I'm not not going
to win nothing.

76
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:21,641
Paul.

77
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:23,992
That guy is a joke.

78
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,847
This lawsuit is definitely
getting thrown out.

79
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:27,894
I don't know, those are
Jean-Ralphio's lawyers.

80
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,338
They once got him $60,000

81
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:31,376
'cause he got too scared
at a haunted house.

82
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:36,626
Okay, are you done?
Are we done? Did we win?

83
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:39,163
- You can't win this.
- You can win at anything.

84
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:41,309
Last year I won
an organic gardening contest.

85
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:42,861
Who were you competing against?

86
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,046
My own taste buds.

87
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:47,573
I wanna have a baby, and Chris
has agreed to be the father.

88
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,186
My fertility counselor
showed me this online quiz

89
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:52,508
that determines whether
we'd be compatible parents.

90
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,724
If this were the '80s,
all we'd have to do is, like,

91
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:57,059
not drop an egg
for a whole day.

92
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,005
Stupid Internet.

93
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:03,302
Okay, our official
co-parenting score is...

94
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:05,877
58% compatibility.

95
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,334
Not amazing.

96
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,582
Oh, I think it's fantastic.

97
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,856
I think it's literally the best score
we could have hoped for.

98
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:13,248
- Not sure that that's true.
- Oh, snap!

99
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:14,627
I just filled it out for fun.

100
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:17,622
Chris and I are 81% compatible.

101
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:19,445
You wanna make a baby, traeger?

102
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,798
Your hair, my everything else.

103
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,955
That kid would be unstoppable.

104
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,114
Guys, I couldn't resist.
I did it too.

105
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:28,944
Ann and I got 84%.

106
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:33,113
- Well, this sucks.
- Yes, we did not win.

107
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,775
So was, like,
Ben a bossy older brother?

108
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,109
Did he make you watch
star war movies?

109
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:40,285
Make me?

110
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,303
I loved those movies
just as much as he did.

111
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:44,025
That's so cute.

112
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,458
Oh, you do a lot of hugging.

113
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:48,517
Yeah, get used to it.
We're sisters now.

114
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:51,989
Benji, I'm really glad
you came back for this.

115
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,776
A lot of jerks around here
didn't think you'd show up.

116
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,561
Well, I wasn't sure, but
Leslie gave me the extra push,

117
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:00,192
and I figured it'd be nice to put the ice
town thing behind me once and for all.

118
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,335
Now that you're both here,
let's get started.

119
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,612
Just have a few questions.

120
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:07,263
- You have a binder?
- That's right.

121
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:08,779
Who were
Ben's high school girlfriends,

122
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,618
and what base
do you think he got to?

123
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:12,734
- Um...
- What's that?

124
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,993
And what exactly
did you witness?

125
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:17,108
Defendant, alias Ron Swanson,

126
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,279
alias my boss,

127
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:22,131
used appropriate force
to prevent further damage

128
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,062
to the wedding of Leslie Knope,

129
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,747
alias my other boss.

130
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,049
You sound as if you have a
special interest in law enforcement.

131
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,579
Yes, sir.
In fact, at the time,

132
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,582
I was trying
to become a police officer

133
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:33,055
but was deemed
unfit for the force.

134
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,213
And what happened?

135
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:34,976
Don't know.

136
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:36,804
Well, I pooched the brain exam.

137
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:40,707
Just to be safe, I wouldn't take
anything I say too seriously.

138
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,009
Next witness, your honor.

139
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,591
Ms. Ludgate, have you
ever heard Mr. Swanson

140
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:47,457
threaten to hurt
councilman Jamm?

141
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,354
Ronny?
Are you kidding me?

142
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:52,147
I've never heard him threaten
to hurt anyone or anything.

143
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,805
The guy's, like, a vegetarian.

144
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,065
Look at him, he's like
a big, old, soft teddy bear.

145
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,353
His nickname around the office

146
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:02,511
is "Softy-Pants McHuggable."

147
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,795
Did you ever hear
Mr. Swanson

148
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,045
say he intended to injure
councilman Jamm

149
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:07,620
before the day of the wedding?

150
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,221
The answer is a flat "no."

151
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,293
Ron doesn't really pay
much attention to other people.

152
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,999
I doubt he even knew
you existed.

153
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:17,079
Also, may I say for the record,
that is a dope pocket square.

154
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:18,400
Can I see that bad boy?

155
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:21,975
Tom and April were excellent
witnesses in my defense.

156
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:25,417
Unfortunately, every single word
out of their mouths was a lie.

157
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,968
There's only one thing
I hate more than lying.

158
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,321
Skim milk.

159
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:33,017
Which is water that's lying
about being milk.

160
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,469
Despite everything
that happened 20 years ago,

161
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:39,205
this will always be
my hometown.

162
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,280
Are you crying again?

163
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:43,414
It's just every time
you say that speech,

164
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,760
I think about where you've been
and where you're going

165
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,313
and our future children
and America

166
00:06:48,338 --> 00:06:50,643
and just our history
as a nation.

167
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,472
Wow, I didn't think
about all that,

168
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,739
but I thought it was good.
- Thanks, Steph.

169
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:57,300
Ah, I'm feeling sweaty.
Do I look swe...

170
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,674
I feel... oh, I need to use
the bathroom one more time.

171
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,320
That's, like,
five times in an hour.

172
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:04,572
Well, somebody's nervous
about the ceremony.

173
00:07:04,578 --> 00:07:05,460
I don't blame him.

174
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:08,324
He didn't exactly leave Partridge
as the most popular guy in town.

175
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:11,042
Ben?

176
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:12,119
Oh, my God.

177
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,981
Are you okay?

178
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,237
I think I'm giving birth.

179
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:20,154
Is that possible?
No, right?

180
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,613
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh, God!

181
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:22,923
I'll call an ambulance.

182
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,630
Oh, God! It's twins!

183
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,944
- I'm having twins!
- Oh! Okay.

184
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,264
- Kidney stone?
- Big sucker too.

185
00:07:32,353 --> 00:07:34,382
We're gonna have to keep him
here until it passes.

186
00:07:34,394 --> 00:07:37,774
Leslie
and Dr. Clipperton...

187
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:41,649
Wow, man, I'm so glad
you guys are meeting.

188
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:44,831
It's like worlds collide.
You know, I love it.

189
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:46,868
I want candy.

190
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,147
What is he on?

191
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,967
Morphine.
It's good stuff.

192
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:51,130
Leslie, come here.

193
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,327
Do you have any idea
how beautiful you are?

194
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,224
I'm serious.
You're like a flower.

195
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:00,475
Or, no, like a snug-bug
or like a snugger-doodle

196
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:01,805
or something like that.

197
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,417
We should just go for it,
you know?

198
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:05,900
Life.

199
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:09,070
We have a ceremony
we need to be at in two hours.

200
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,564
Is there anything
that we can do?

201
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,393
Sorry, Ice Town, you're not going
anywhere for at least a day.

202
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:15,586
Okay, well,
I'll call mayor Stice,

203
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,092
and we'll reschedule
the ceremony.

204
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,328
No, this town expects me
to wuss out.

205
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,628
I'm making that speech,

206
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:24,030
and I'm simply gonna explain to
the crowd that love is everywhere

207
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:27,313
and they have to surrender to the
flow of the universe, you know?

208
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,246
Price Is Right is on, I think.

209
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:33,822
Oh, you remember staying home
sick from school...

210
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:36,813
watching the price is right?

211
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,907
Oh, God.

212
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,811
Look, I know that this
is just a silly quiz,

213
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:44,079
but it is so discouraging
to do so poorly.

214
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:47,543
Well, look, this is not the only way
to see if we would be good parents.

215
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:48,804
I know it's a little lame,

216
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,823
but I bought a dozen eggs
at the grocery store,

217
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,898
and I thought we could do that thing where
we pretend the egg is a kid for a day.

218
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,435
That's a great idea!

219
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:57,369
I don't see them.

220
00:08:57,824 --> 00:08:58,813
Oh, my God.

221
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:01,093
- I left them at the grocery store.
- Oh, boy.

222
00:09:01,204 --> 00:09:02,418
I bought 12 babies,

223
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:04,425
and then I immediately
abandoned them at a Kroger's.

224
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:06,380
Look, we can use
anything as a baby.

225
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:09,094
I mean, we could use this mug.

226
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:16,547
I don't understand.
I was great.

227
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,462
I was like Mark Z
in The Social "N."

228
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,015
My testimony was amazing
for your case.

229
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,553
But it wasn't the truth.

230
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:22,988
And neither was yours.

231
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,298
You even called me a...
vegetarian.

232
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,313
What if that testimony leaks?

233
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:28,815
How will people
ever respect me?

234
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:31,547
Ugh, whatever.
The truth is stupid.

235
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,298
I only tell the truth when it
makes me sound like I'm lying.

236
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:36,073
Yeah, lying is all I know.

237
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:38,445
It's how I was able to scrape by
on the streets of Bombay

238
00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:40,708
and make it on the Indian version
of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire

239
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:42,408
and get reunited
with the love of my life,

240
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:43,389
Latika.

241
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:45,509
You could both take
a lesson from Andrew.

242
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:47,837
He told the truth
about everything he was asked,

243
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,862
even when it was
humiliating for him.

244
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:52,333
That's right.
I love telling the truth.

245
00:09:52,396 --> 00:09:53,353
Case in point,

246
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,033
sometimes when I blow my nose,
I get a boner.

247
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,167
I don't know why.
It just happens.

248
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,420
Truth bomb.

249
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:00,260
I'm gonna call you both
back in that room,

250
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:01,808
and you'll recant
your testimony.

251
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,203
- No!
- You committed perjury.

252
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:06,821
But more importantly,
you've dishonored yourselves.

253
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:08,595
Oh, brother.

254
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:12,608
They are so young.

255
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:14,723
So much to learn.

256
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,113
- What are you talking about?
- I know, right?

257
00:10:19,524 --> 00:10:20,791
Wisdom.

258
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:22,156
Sick?

259
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,905
Do you really expect me to believe that?
What has he got, acute wimping out?

260
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:26,972
No, he has kidney stones.
We have proof.

261
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:31,050
Yeah, I took a video of him
at the hospital an hour ago.

262
00:10:31,526 --> 00:10:34,328
I feel like I never gave
miles Davis proper shrift.

263
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,406
Like, I just didn't
get into it.

264
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:39,651
But the good news is I'm here
to accept the key on his behalf.

265
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,462
Boy, it's just a real shame

266
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,012
it had to happen today
of all days.

267
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:45,248
Damn it!

268
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:47,708
Excuse me.

269
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:49,379
Hi.
Everything okay?

270
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:50,735
You want me to come back
to the hospital?

271
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:52,899
Pfft, nah.
I'm goodie goodie.

272
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,022
You just do your thing,
baby smurf.

273
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:56,465
I mean, I wish you were here.

274
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:58,415
It seems pretty fun
and festive.

275
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,748
Town mascot is here.

276
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:00,992
Fred the Sled?

277
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,004
They only bring him out
for special occasions.

278
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:06,556
I can't believe they're doing
all this for me.

279
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,656
The universe is love.

280
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:11,081
Okay, stay away
from sharp things.

281
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:12,508
Well, well, well,

282
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:15,058
heard you want to recant
your earlier statements.

283
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,700
Yes, I misremembered
some things.

284
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:20,058
I did in fact hear
Ron Swanson say

285
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,569
he intended to injure
Jeremy Jamm.

286
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,331
Boom, knew it.

287
00:11:24,343 --> 00:11:26,929
- Tell us about it, please.
- Which time?

288
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,515
Well, how many were there?

289
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:30,234
Well...

290
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:31,572
Yeah, we did a trade.

291
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,360
I gave his wife new enamels,

292
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:35,512
he gave my wife new yabbos.

293
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,363
Who's that gentleman?

294
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,987
Jeremy Jamm, city councilman.

295
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,584
- You don't know him?
- Never met him.

296
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,453
He looks like he could use a swift
punch in the face though.

297
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:45,040
Yes!

298
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:48,267
And then before he can say anything,
I just run over, shove him into the pool.

299
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:49,324
Bully for you.

300
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,701
If it were me, I would have
just punched him in the face.

301
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,317
What's up, Ron?

302
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:58,337
Just daydreaming
about punching Jamm in the face.

303
00:11:58,414 --> 00:11:59,789
And there were
a few other times too.

304
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,150
- We get the picture, son.
- Hold on.

305
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:05,309
We need your full,
truthful testimony on record.

306
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,634
Keep going, Tom.

307
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,634
But now, 20 years later,

308
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:12,818
the city has finally healed

309
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:16,207
from the festering wound
of Ice Town.

310
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:20,185
Today we put those horribly
painful memories behind us

311
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:24,131
as we welcome back the mayor
who made all of that possible,

312
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:26,945
Ben Wyatt.

313
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,535
Oh, that's a typo.
That's a major typo.

314
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:32,664
That says "Ice Clown."

315
00:12:32,692 --> 00:12:34,279
I'm just realizing now
that's not a typo.

316
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,470
Hey, aren't you his sister?

317
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:37,828
I gotta get outta here.

318
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:39,113
Good luck, Leslie.

319
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:42,226
Here to accept the key
to the city of Partridge,

320
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:45,176
because Mr. Wyatt
is conveniently ill,

321
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:47,663
is his wife Leslie Knope.

322
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:51,918
And it's water.

323
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:56,626
Uhoh, the key was made of ice.

324
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,328
And much like the hopes and dreams
of the people of Partridge,

325
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,280
it melted away.

326
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:05,189
Again, this would all be way
more satisfying if Ben was here.

327
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:06,852
Okay, excuse me.

328
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:08,848
I would like to point out
that we drove

329
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:10,828
all the way here
from Pawnee, Indiana,

330
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:13,182
a city with some class,
by the way.

331
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:17,651
And, sure, my husband made
an honest mistake 20 years ago.

332
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:19,701
But it was very meaningful
that you were gonna finally...

333
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:21,174
- Hi, Leslie.
- Be able to forgive him.

334
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,293
If it's so meaningful to him,
then where is he?

335
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:24,787
He's in the hospital, sir.

336
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:27,670
He has a calcified rock
lodged in his penis!

337
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:31,615
Frankly, Ben Wyatt is the best thing
to ever come out of this crap town.

338
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,882
Oh, yeah?
What about Judy Garland?

339
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,579
Judy Garland's from Partridge?

340
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,550
She lived here for a while.

341
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:38,925
And Lee Janzen.

342
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,081
Who's Lee Janzen?

343
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:41,920
He's a golfer.
He's pretty good.

344
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:43,938
Well, Ben Wyatt's
better than Lee Janzen,

345
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:45,382
and he's better
than Judy Garland.

346
00:13:46,387 --> 00:13:48,212
That's crazy.
Judy Garland's amazing.

347
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:51,528
But Ben Wyatt is better than all of you
because he cared about this town,

348
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:52,878
and he tried to help it.

349
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,598
You know, screw you, Partridge.

350
00:13:56,223 --> 00:13:59,662
And a sled is a stupid mascot.

351
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,302
Thank you, Ms. Ludgate.

352
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,046
It is now quite clear
that on innumerable occasions

353
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:08,918
Ron Swanson said he intended
to punch councilman Jamm

354
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,723
in the face, and then he did.

355
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,087
Yeah, but who cares?

356
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:13,237
He says a lot of things.

357
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,070
He's always talking about
overthrowing the government,

358
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:16,175
but he never does that.

359
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:17,602
Well, that'll make
a nice pull quote

360
00:14:17,626 --> 00:14:20,555
for the article about me
taking you to the cleaners.

361
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:24,233
Mr. Swanson, if you'd like
to make a statement, you may.

362
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,149
On the night I punched
councilman Jamm in the face,

363
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,253
I warned him several times
to back off.

364
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,183
And instead,
he attacked me twice.

365
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,902
Truthfully, I barely
registered his attack.

366
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:37,572
He's incredibly frail,
and his arms are weak.

367
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:39,554
And when I punched him,
he dropped so quickly,

368
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,965
I thought he was diving
towards the ground.

369
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:44,574
I regret nothing.
The end.

370
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:48,763
Well, this turned out better
than I ever imagined.

371
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,740
You got Jammed
by your own team.

372
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:51,996
Self-Jamm!

373
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:53,202
I'll see you in court, Swanson,

374
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,502
and, uh, bring your checkbook.

375
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:58,275
I would like to punch you
in the face again.

376
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,372
Okay, Paul, let's go.

377
00:15:03,064 --> 00:15:04,308
I'm glad you're feeling better.

378
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,456
Well,
get your normal conversation

379
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:07,637
in with me while you can.

380
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:10,334
Got about 20 minutes
before I get all loopy again.

381
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:12,604
Mm, let me see the key.

382
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:14,788
Oh, uh, they took it back.

383
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:16,446
They wanted to get it engraved.

384
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:17,109
Huh.

385
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,693
You know,
the key is just a metaphor.

386
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,766
I mean, the real key has been
inside you all along.

387
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:23,081
It was a setup, wasn't it?

388
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:24,904
They were gonna make fun of me?

389
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,160
Yes.

390
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:30,293
Ice Town was a debacle.
They'll never get over it.

391
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:31,866
Just don't know
why I got my hopes up.

392
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:33,758
It's so unfair.
You worked so hard.

393
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:35,046
You've done
so many great things.

394
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:38,279
And for your hometown
to treat you this way is just...

395
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:40,720
You know what, screw this.

396
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,261
We're gonna make one more stop
before we leave.

397
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,492
Tuck in your shirt.
We're going to city hall.

398
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:47,336
So, Dr. Van Dyne, we took
the compatibility test

399
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,941
that you recommended,
and we didn't do amazing.

400
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:53,311
But I'm sure that happens
with a lot of couples, right?

401
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:54,566
And it's not like we failed.

402
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:55,950
We got a 58%,

403
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:58,769
which as I'm saying it, sounds
very clearly like we failed.

404
00:15:58,913 --> 00:16:01,424
Look, there are many ways
to judge compatibility.

405
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:03,677
Okay, you know what,
let's do a little exercise.

406
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:06,631
I'm gonna say something
about your future child,

407
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:09,354
and then you just say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

408
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:11,061
Okay?
Gender.

409
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,228
- Girl.
- Boy.

410
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:14,058
Okay.
Religion.

411
00:16:14,118 --> 00:16:15,254
- Buddhist.
- Whatever he wants.

412
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:16,917
Whatever he wants.

413
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,807
Um, how 'bout occupation?

414
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:21,056
- Teacher.
- Sixtime tour de France champion.

415
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:21,756
Really?

416
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,020
Okay, I'm sorry,
are you guys complete strangers?

417
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,442
Is this one of those
craigslist father situations?

418
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:27,323
No, no, no.

419
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:29,369
We actually know each other
quite well.

420
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:31,257
Yeah, we used to date actually,

421
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,740
but it didn't work out

422
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,321
because we had
some compatibility issues.

423
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,393
You know what, why don't we just
try one more compatibility test?

424
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:39,957
- Great, let's do it!
- No, let's not.

425
00:16:42,056 --> 00:16:43,927
Okay, well,
we all told the truth,

426
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:45,732
and Jamm's definitely
going to win.

427
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:46,707
What do we do now?

428
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:48,607
I intend to do
as the court orders.

429
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,604
Do you know if one can pay
court-ordered settlements in gold?

430
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:53,317
All of my money's in gold.

431
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:55,293
I also have some money
in palladium.

432
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,709
What if it's a huge amount?
Are you gonna be okay financially?

433
00:16:57,727 --> 00:16:58,555
I think so.

434
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,808
I'm actually not sure
how much money I have.

435
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:03,377
But I do know how many pounds
of money I have.

436
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,365
Whoa, whoa, that is awesome.

437
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:07,757
Yes, it is, and I'm definitely
tweeting that to Drake

438
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:08,937
to use in his next rhymes,

439
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,845
but still I kinda feel
like this is our fault.

440
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:14,939
Ugh, do we have to do
something nice now?

441
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,163
Let me start by apologizing,
mayor Stice.

442
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:20,135
I had no right
to disparage your town.

443
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:22,244
Well, I owe you guys
an apology too.

444
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:25,025
I, uh, had a little
bad publicity lately,

445
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,902
and frankly, it's still really easy
to score points by bashing Wyatt.

446
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:32,015
Can't you just give Ben
a key to the city,

447
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,176
here, now, in your office,

448
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:36,279
where no one
will know your shame?

449
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,095
- Sorry, babe.
- No worries.

450
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:39,601
I love you.

451
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:40,279
Aw.

452
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:42,460
You know, if people found out

453
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,731
I gave Wyatt
the key to the city,

454
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,120
I would never
get re-elected.

455
00:17:46,138 --> 00:17:47,075
So...

456
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:48,144
no.

457
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:50,494
What are you doing there,
Wyatt?

458
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:52,741
I'm feeding your eagle.

459
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:54,663
He's starving.

460
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:56,768
It's... it's bronze, babe.

461
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,825
- Why?
- The eagle...

462
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,602
We should go.
- Yeah.

463
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:03,094
Ann Perkins.

464
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:06,587
I know it didn't seem to go
very well at the counselor's.

465
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,347
But I have found a new quiz,

466
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:10,891
and I think we should take it.

467
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:11,716
Are you sure?

468
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:15,568
Everything we do makes it seem like it's
a bad idea for us to have a kid together.

469
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:17,464
Maybe we shouldn't even
be friends.

470
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:18,998
Take a look.

471
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,775
"Will you love our child

472
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,441
and work hard to see
that he or she has a good life?"

473
00:18:24,764 --> 00:18:27,147
You see, I think that's
the only question that matters.

474
00:18:27,209 --> 00:18:29,341
All the rest of it is details.

475
00:18:29,707 --> 00:18:30,742
Yes.

476
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,849
The answer is yes.

477
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:35,281
I said the exact same thing.

478
00:18:35,362 --> 00:18:38,126
We're 100% on the same page.

479
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:39,512
Are you sure about this?

480
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,625
You are caring,

481
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,737
intelligent,

482
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:43,879
and reliable.

483
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,510
And I am certain
that you will literally be

484
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,784
the world's best mom.

485
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:52,762
Wow.
This is really happening.

486
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:57,944
- You know there's nothing in there
yet, right? - Yes, sorry.

487
00:18:58,696 --> 00:19:01,146
No, I was with Johnny Cougar
Mellencamp at that music fest.

488
00:19:01,164 --> 00:19:04,795
We both thought, biggest yabbos
we've ever seen in...

489
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,061
What the hell?
That was important.

490
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:08,798
Game's over, councilman.

491
00:19:08,923 --> 00:19:09,811
Drop the suit.

492
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:12,003
And why exactly
would I do that?

493
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,973
We took a look
at your affidavit.

494
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:16,062
We cross-referenced it
with telephone records

495
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:17,764
and eyewitness accounts,

496
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:20,870
and, uh-oh,
we found 11 lies.

497
00:19:20,901 --> 00:19:22,637
Lying under oath
is called perjury,

498
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:24,441
and they should know,
they did it yesterday.

499
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:28,209
Well, I mean,
maybe I accidentally

500
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:30,961
said something that wasn't...

501
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,540
Let me see that.

502
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:34,719
Ow!
My wrist!

503
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:36,546
You twisted my arm
like a maniac!

504
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:39,033
- Oh, no!
- You monster.

505
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:39,983
Ow!

506
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:42,371
You assaulted me,
and I'm injured!

507
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:43,764
Oh, my God, Tom, are you okay?

508
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:45,383
All right, you know what,
I see what you're doing.

509
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:46,652
I barely touched you.

510
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,804
That's not what I saw.

511
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:50,118
My face!
Is my face still there?

512
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,406
What happened to my knees?

513
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:52,879
Someone please tell me
if Tom is okay.

514
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:55,063
- Jamm, I'm gonna sue you.
- Okay, fine.

515
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:59,044
Hey, listen, keep your mouths
shut about the affidavit,

516
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:00,800
I'll drop the suit, okay?

517
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,966
Hurry, Tom,
let's get you into surgery!

518
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:04,179
Yeah.

519
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,463
Yeah, it's me.

520
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:09,470
We got Jammed.

521
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,388
My friend Jack and I used to
fish this lake in the summer.

522
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,574
One time,
our boat almost tipped over,

523
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,184
but then it didn't.

524
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,840
That's not a great story.

525
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:23,111
Yeah, I had
a pretty uneventful childhood.

526
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:25,664
I got you something.

527
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:28,313
- No way.
- Yeah.

528
00:20:28,325 --> 00:20:29,882
Where did you get that?

529
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,640
I stole it
from mayor Stice's office.

530
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:33,570
Screw that guy.
You should have it.

531
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:36,482
You're the best wife
in the world.

532
00:20:36,711 --> 00:20:39,117
But I don't want this.

533
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:40,410
Really?

534
00:20:40,454 --> 00:20:42,242
Yeah, I mean, I love Partridge,

535
00:20:42,258 --> 00:20:44,193
but I have Pawnee now.

536
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:45,792
And I have you.

537
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,424
Well, I'm not giving it
back to Stice.

538
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:49,571
- That guy sucks.
- Yeah.

539
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:52,297
Well, you know what then?

540
00:21:00,814 --> 00:21:03,249
Hey, lake's not
a garbage can, pal.

541
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,350
Yeah, sorry, it was symbolic.

542
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,739
Is that Ben Wyatt?

543
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:08,536
Get the hell out of here,
Ice Town!

544
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:10,336
- Run! Run!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

545
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:12,151
Sorry.

546
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:17,226
