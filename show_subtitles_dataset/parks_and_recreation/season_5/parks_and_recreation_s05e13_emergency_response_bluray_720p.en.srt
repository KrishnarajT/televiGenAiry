1
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:30,580
If I could sum up
the Pawnee Commons

2
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:32,710
in one word, it would be:

3
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:34,510
Dynamite.

4
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:37,580
"Dynamite" stands for
daring, youth-friendly,

5
00:00:37,582 --> 00:00:40,082
natural, amazing, merry,
inviting,

6
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:43,252
tourist attraction-y,
and eco-friendly.

7
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:44,804
Thank you,
Councilwoman Knope...

8
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:45,939
very, very thorough

9
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:48,191
- and so many acronyms.
- I know.

10
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:49,192
Councilman Jamm?

11
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:50,193
Thank you, Bill.

12
00:00:50,195 --> 00:00:52,762
No, please,
everyone be seated.

13
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:56,097
Let the record show
there was a standing ovation.

14
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,850
- No, there wasn't.
- There was not.

15
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:58,968
History will decide.

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,271
My plan
for lot 48 is simple.

17
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:02,605
But why read it

18
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:05,692
when you can shove it
right in your face?

19
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:06,993
I want to sell this lot
to Paunch Burger.

20
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:07,994
Here's why.

21
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:09,478
We make money.
They make money.

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,447
They make burgers.
We eat burgers.

23
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:12,448
Mmhmm.

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,701
That's a win-win-win-win.

25
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:16,586
Presentation over.
Jamm out.

26
00:01:16,588 --> 00:01:17,820
Oh, man.

27
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:19,872
Are there curly fries?
I love their curly fries.

28
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:21,490
Ann.

29
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:23,426
Well, the planning commission
has a week to decide

30
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:26,429
if they want a beautiful,
innovative community park

31
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,548
or a bunch
of greasy lard bombs.

32
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,849
I'm not editorializing.

33
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,268
Paunch Burger's
number-one-selling burger

34
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,070
is the greasy lard bomb.

35
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:36,389
Just give me a hint as to
which way you guys are leaning.

36
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,608
Off the record?
We're leaning towards Jamm.

37
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,810
Why? You know my plan
is better for the community.

38
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:44,145
Oh, it's way better,
but you're also short $50,000.

39
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,449
We can't approve
an underfunded project.

40
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:47,850
Hey, get the rest
of the money,

41
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:49,352
you get your park.

42
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:50,820
You only have a week.

43
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:52,572
What are we going
to do, guys?

44
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:53,957
How are we going
to get that money?

45
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,709
Hey, come on.
Cheer up, little pups.

46
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:57,877
Registering
for your wedding

47
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,495
is the most important moment
of your lives.

48
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,331
Love...
love fades away.

49
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:04,417
But things...

50
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,252
- Things are forever.
- That's beautiful.

51
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:08,087
Did the Dalai Lama say that?

52
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:10,923
Ooh!
A citrus reamer!

53
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,925
Oh, this is the only way
to ream citrus.

54
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:13,926
You're gonna need
two of these.

55
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:14,978
I don't want
a citrus reamer.

56
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,379
I don't want
any of this stuff.

57
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:18,881
Look, all I want is
to be married to you

58
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:21,851
and to somehow get $50,000.

59
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:23,719
Hey, hang on.

60
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,356
What if we register for the park
instead of the stuff?

61
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,858
We could organize
a black-tie gala

62
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,942
with food and music

63
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:32,028
and maybe a silent auction
to raise money.

64
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,446
Yeah,
and people could donate,

65
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,947
or they could bid
to put their names

66
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:35,949
on everything
in the park,

67
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,583
like benches,
cobblestones,

68
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:39,118
trees, ants, air.

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,370
Right, some of that
is possible.

70
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:42,005
- You are a genius. Let's go.
- Okay.

71
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:43,172
Hey, guys.

72
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:46,342
I'm really feeling
these sheets... very cozy.

73
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:53,680
Sync & corrections by Alice

74
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,197
I just want
to say thank you

75
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,649
for all your hard work
this week.

76
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:10,700
Give yourselves a hand.

77
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:13,986
But your applause
is premature.

78
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,571
You just told us
to applaud.

79
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:17,707
Well, if I told you to jump
off a bridge, would you do it?

80
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,325
I hope so,
because the only way

81
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:20,460
that this gala
is going to happen

82
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:21,711
is if you do
everything I say.

83
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:23,212
Tom, I need you
to contact

84
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:24,747
three more food vendors
on this list,

85
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:25,998
and they need to do it
for free.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,166
I'm omelet.

87
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:28,251
Get it?
"I'm on it,"I'm omelet"?

88
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:29,469
I get it, and I love it,

89
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,087
but I don't have time
for food puns right now.

90
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:32,171
Okay, I'm heading out.
Good-pie.

91
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:33,506
Go.

92
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,508
Gurt. Go-gurt.
I'm incredible.

93
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,509
See you guys.

94
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:37,510
Okay.
Donna, Jerry...

95
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:39,795
Leslie!

96
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,931
Leslie, we need you back
at the command center right now!

97
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:43,483
We have a class-one
city emergency.

98
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:45,101
Oh, my God.
Gayle.

99
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:46,769
My girls!

100
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:47,904
What's the emergency?

101
00:03:47,906 --> 00:03:49,472
Oh, this is just a drill,

102
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:51,307
but I am having so much fun
pretending it's real.

103
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,475
Are you kidding me?

104
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:54,694
The disaster-preparedness people
picked today?

105
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:57,280
Each year every city
in Indiana is reviewed

106
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:59,415
by the Department
of Emergency Preparedness.

107
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,502
And Pawnee has failed
12 years in a row.

108
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:04,954
On last year's report,
they stated,

109
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:07,757
"Every time it so much
as drizzles in Pawnee,

110
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,258
"the town is in danger
of collapsing

111
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,677
into Thunderdome-style,
post-apocalyptic mayhem."

112
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:14,931
Okay, we don't know how long
Leslie's going to be gone,

113
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,467
so let's just knock
some of this stuff off.

114
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:19,802
Should someone
stop Jerry?

115
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:23,189
Gayle!

116
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:26,342
Eh, he'll figure it out
eventually.

117
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:28,277
First, we do
the written exam,

118
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,696
and then we do
the personality evaluation,

119
00:04:30,698 --> 00:04:33,282
which I feel like I'm gonna
nail, 'cause people always say,

120
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:35,401
"But he's got
a great personality."

121
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:38,488
Okay, quiz me.

122
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,823
Okay, what does it mean
when an officer calls in a 3542?

123
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:44,193
Assault and battery.
The way I remember that,

124
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:48,228
I picture 35 a-salt shakers
and 42 batteries.

125
00:04:48,716 --> 00:04:51,033
Great. What is
the criminal code for arson?

126
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:52,335
Arson is 533.

127
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:53,469
You know how
I remember that?

128
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,172
I picture 533
salt shakers and batteries

129
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:57,473
lighting a building
on fire.

130
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:59,142
Oh, I'm nervous.

131
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:00,709
Babe, look at me.

132
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,011
You are going
to pass this test,

133
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,346
and you are going
to become a cop.

134
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,848
And if you don't,
I'll just divorce you

135
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,016
and marry someone else

136
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:08,684
and then cheat on them
with you.

137
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:11,320
Aw, that's so sweet.

138
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:14,056
Also, I got you
a lucky charm.

139
00:05:14,058 --> 00:05:15,441
I found a dead rabbit
on the side of the road,

140
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:17,610
and I cut its feet off
and made it into a lucky charm.

141
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:20,530
Baby, you are so creepy.

142
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:22,898
Thank you. I love it.

143
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,867
Dwyer, you're up.

144
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:26,669
My name
is Leonard Tchulm.

145
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:28,004
I'm head
of the Indiana Department

146
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:30,039
of Emergency Preparedness.

147
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:31,290
And today
I'm going to bring

148
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,042
death and destruction
to your town.

149
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:36,179
I am Leslie Knope.
I am the Pawnee Emergency Czar.

150
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:38,264
And this year, we are more
than prepared for your test,

151
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:41,417
but, um, it just so happens,
today is a little inconvenient.

152
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,135
Good, because
the best day for a drill

153
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,587
is when it's inconvenient
for everyone.

154
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,755
My mother is getting
a colonoscopy today.

155
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:48,941
I'm not even sure there's
anyone there to drive her home,

156
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,860
so we're all making sacrifices,
Ms. Knope.

157
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,695
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear about your mother.

158
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:54,397
Mm, we're not that close.

159
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,898
Oh. Good.

160
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,934
Okay, volunteer victims,

161
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,936
please put your
identification placards on now

162
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:03,122
and go to your designated areas
throughout town.

163
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:04,957
First Responders,
return to your stations,

164
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,959
and the simulation
begins...

165
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:09,745
N-n-n...

166
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:14,800
Went past the zero.

167
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:17,386
I got to wait till it goes...

168
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:20,139
Okay, now.

169
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:21,790
All right, officers,
bolt the doors.

170
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,893
We are officially
in lockdown mode.

171
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:25,177
The doors will not open

172
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,763
until Leonard announces
that this drill is complete.

173
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:28,964
The most important event

174
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:30,683
that I have ever organized
in my entire life

175
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:34,018
is happening in eight hours,
and I am stuck in this room.

176
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,472
This is a nightmare.

177
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:39,492
Wait.
Maybe this is a nightmare.

178
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:43,362
Nope, can't fly away.

179
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:44,614
This is real life.

180
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,614
And now, I'm going to open
one of these ten envelopes at random

181
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:51,452
to determine
your simulated disaster.

182
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,056
Pawnee
has been hit by...

183
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:56,340
A strain of avian flu.

184
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:58,375
Yes! Avian flu!
Jackpot.

185
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,810
This is a simple one, guys.

186
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:01,479
Everybody
open their binders, okay?

187
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:04,182
- "The Knope Protocol"?
- Uh, correction.

188
00:07:04,184 --> 00:07:07,235
That's "Mission Im-Pawnee-able:
Knope Protocol."

189
00:07:07,237 --> 00:07:09,353
Now, if everyone just
follows my instructions,

190
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:11,906
we will ace this test, and
we will be done in 90 minutes.

191
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:14,725
"Step one...
insert the DVD scenario."

192
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:16,727
Hmm, what could be on this?

193
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:18,896
Good evening,
this is Channel 4 lead anchor

194
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,231
Willow Tremaine,
with breaking news.

195
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:23,167
Avian flu has just
hit the town of Pawnee.

196
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,536
We go live now
to St. Joseph's Medical Center

197
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:27,238
for an update.

198
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,372
Hello, my name is

199
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,124
Donatella Breckinridge, M.D.
I graduated

200
00:07:30,126 --> 00:07:31,927
first in my class
from Harvard Medical School,

201
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:33,077
so I know
what I'm talking about.

202
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,214
This is the avian flu,
or we call "H5N1."

203
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:39,250
Donna, are we on schedule
for the tent setup?

204
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:41,269
The tables showed up,
which is good,

205
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,271
but there are no chairs,
which is bad.

206
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:46,606
Okay, well, get some chairs
from somewhere.

207
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,977
Great leadership...
inspiring.

208
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,530
Oh, God. Leslie was gonna
go on Pawnee Today

209
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:55,865
- to promote the gala.
- I'll do it.

210
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:58,536
No offense, Ron, but I don't
think you'd be great on TV.

211
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:01,205
I can speak in full sentences,
and I won't cry.

212
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:04,540
Fair point.
I did cry last time.

213
00:08:04,544 --> 00:08:06,961
Godspeed.

214
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:10,296
Mmm! Smells amazing, Chef.
What you cooking?

215
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,583
Little coq au vin?
Little bouillabaisse?

216
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,919
You can stop
the ass-kissing, Haverford.

217
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:17,305
I know why you're here.
I cannot do the gala.

218
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:18,622
It doesn't make
business sense

219
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,141
to cater something that big
for free.

220
00:08:20,143 --> 00:08:22,476
Please. If the gala
doesn't go perfectly,

221
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:23,978
the lot could become
a Paunch Burger.

222
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,264
Doesn't that offend your refined
Parisian sensibilities?

223
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,815
I'm from Orlando.

224
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:29,600
And I don't care
about the Paunch Burger.

225
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:32,935
If it was another French
restaurant, maybe I'd worry.

226
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:36,073
Hey!
Well, you know what?

227
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,775
What? What?

228
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,643
What you got for me?
Get out of my kitchen!

229
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,861
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

230
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:42,114
Pardon! Pardon!

231
00:08:43,116 --> 00:08:44,248
Hey,
can you hear me?

232
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,317
Oh!
Leslie, you on the TV!

233
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,985
Well,
you're on mine, Brett.

234
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:50,454
- We're having a video conference.
- Oh, okay.

235
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:52,456
Pawnee has been hit
with the avian flu.

236
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,959
- Tight.
- No, this is bad news.

237
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,794
I need everyone there
at Animal Control

238
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:59,597
to eradicate
all the infected birds in town.

239
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:02,516
"Kill all birds."

240
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,685
- This is for the drill, right?
- Yes.

241
00:09:04,687 --> 00:09:07,021
But I'm actually gonna kill
these birds for real?

242
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:08,889
No.
No, just pretend.

243
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:11,675
Right. So how do I kill 'em...
like, with a gun?

244
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,177
No.

245
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:15,279
I could fill up a bathtub and
just drown 'em one at a time.

246
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:17,198
Okay, let's forget
we ever talked.

247
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,316
Got it. Kill 'em.

248
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,401
Okay, casualty update...
only four dead,

249
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:23,037
two of whom were already
gravely ill and brothers.

250
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,688
That family
took a terrible hit.

251
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,823
Well, that's great news.

252
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:27,691
Not so fast.
I regret to inform you

253
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,994
that someone in this room
has begun exhibiting symptoms...

254
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:32,496
- Christopher Traeger.
- What?

255
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:35,716
A few months ago, the thought
of an infectious disease,

256
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:37,468
even hypothetical,
would have sent me

257
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,536
careening
towards Bummerville,

258
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,871
but now I am infected
with a killer virus,

259
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:46,060
and I feel fine.

260
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:47,395
Therapy!

261
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:48,813
This is
highly irregular.

262
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:50,547
We have followed protocol
to the letter.

263
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,849
No, you did not.

264
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:53,684
Unfortunately, no one contacted
the transit department

265
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:54,819
to shut down bus service.

266
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:57,554
So you rode a bus
with a contagious man,

267
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,690
and he infected you
and 39 others.

268
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,575
That is impossible.
I do not ride the bus.

269
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:03,727
I ride my bicycle behind the bus
as a windbreak.

270
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,396
Doesn't matter.
Prepare for the diarrhea.

271
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:08,065
Okay, who was supposed to deal
with Transit?

272
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,039
My bad, guys. That's my bad.
Chris, very sorry.

273
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,407
Damn it, Jamm.

274
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,242
I should've had animal control
kill you.

275
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:20,244
- Oh, who you want me to kill?
- No one.

276
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,578
I'll kill him...

277
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,931
As soon as I'm done
with these birds.

278
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,066
Hello.

279
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:28,901
I'm here for the interview
about tonight's gala.

280
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:31,755
Yeah, listen, I'm a little
under the weather.

281
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,424
I went on a booze cruise
last week.

282
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,026
It just finished up
an hour ago.

283
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:41,149
On a completely unrelated note,
I have horrible allergies.

284
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,683
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

285
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:45,202
But I do need
to promote this event.

286
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:47,154
Don't worry about me.
I'm a true professional.

287
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:49,022
The show must go on.
In five, four, three...

288
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,491
Two...

289
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:53,826
Hello.
I'm Joan Callamezzo.

290
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:57,546
Today's show will not go on.

291
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:05,406
It seems like her allergies
are kicking in.

292
00:11:06,676 --> 00:11:09,009
My name is Ron Swanson.

293
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,394
I am here to tell you

294
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:13,380
about a black-tie gala
fund-raiser for Pawnee Commons

295
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,515
happening tonight.

296
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:17,251
All proceeds will go
toward building a park.

297
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:19,086
It will be enjoyable.

298
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:21,021
Take a...
take a phone call.

299
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:23,173
Now I will take your calls,
apparently.

300
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:24,658
Yes?

301
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,360
Hey, Joan,
settle a bet for me.

302
00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:28,696
Who's the sexiest couple
in history?

303
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:30,914
R-Patz and K-Stew,
or Bieber...

304
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:35,736
Hey, how's it going?

305
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:39,071
Uh, well, this simulated
disaster is a total disaster.

306
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,257
How are you?

307
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,509
Ron subbed for you
on Pawnee Today.

308
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:45,579
Ron who? Ron Swanson?
On television?

309
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,215
You know we want
people to come, right?

310
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:49,883
Donna still can't find
any chairs.

311
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:51,135
We don't know where Jerry is.

312
00:11:51,137 --> 00:11:53,220
And now some firemen are using

313
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:55,806
the lot as a triage center
for the emergency drill.

314
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:57,441
Okay, here's what you do.
Listen to me caref...

315
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:59,226
Attention.
Panic from the outbreak

316
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:00,861
has overloaded
cell phone towers.

317
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:02,813
Please deposit your phones
into this box.

318
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,264
Oh, my God,
this drill will never end.

319
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,949
- Okay, tell the firefighters...
- All phones.

320
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,735
To set up triage
at the high school...

321
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:08,869
- All phones.
- And then to...

322
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:09,936
but I'm talking
to someone important.

323
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,071
- All phones.
- Let me tell him

324
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:12,656
something important.
Fix it, Ben! Fix it!

325
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:13,824
Okay.

326
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:15,876
What?

327
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:18,712
I found one chair,
got a lead on a second.

328
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:21,081
Keep me posted.

329
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,949
So this test will determine

330
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,052
whether you have
the right personality profile

331
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:26,136
to be a police officer.

332
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:28,172
Just to make sure
the machine is working,

333
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:30,424
is your name Andy?

334
00:12:30,426 --> 00:12:32,593
I don't know
how to answer that.

335
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:35,746
- A simple "yes" or "no."
- Well, everyone calls me Andy,

336
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:38,148
but my full name is Andrew,
I think,

337
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,484
so...

338
00:12:40,486 --> 00:12:42,236
No?

339
00:12:42,238 --> 00:12:43,970
Wait. Yes.

340
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,305
Let's move on.

341
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,407
Scenario...
a high-school-aged child

342
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:49,276
asks to hold
your service revolver.

343
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:50,277
What do you do?

344
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,412
Yes, I give it to him.

345
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,782
When I was a kid, I always
wanted to hold a cop's gun.

346
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:57,484
To make that dream come true
for another kid...

347
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,254
Well, that's what being a cop
is all about.

348
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:02,989
Scenario... you pull a car over
for speeding.

349
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,324
You find out
that it's your father.

350
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,093
- How do you handle the situation?
- Ooh.

351
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:09,428
Well, first,
I would be like,

352
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,014
"Dad...

353
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:13,183
"You're alive?
What the hell?

354
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:15,602
Also, do you know
where my catcher's mitt is?"

355
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:18,505
Shouldn't you be taking her
to lie down somewhere?

356
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,841
Oh, no. If she ever found out
that we took her off camera,

357
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,175
we'd all be fired.

358
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,361
So just, uh, keep taking calls.
You're doing great.

359
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:25,529
Three, two...

360
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,281
Hello, again.

361
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:28,532
I'm Ron Swanson,

362
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:30,567
and I am still taking
your calls...

363
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:32,436
hopefully,
about tonight's gala.

364
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,787
You're on the air.

365
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:36,156
Hi, uh, what's wrong
with Joan?

366
00:13:36,158 --> 00:13:38,025
She has a bad hangover,

367
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:40,327
which she is pretending
is allergies.

368
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:41,829
Is she gonna be okay?

369
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,314
Wouldn't know...
never been hungover.

370
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,183
After I've had
too much whiskey,

371
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:48,051
I cook myself
a large flank steak,

372
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:49,453
pan-fried
in salted butter.

373
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,221
I eat that,
put on a pair of wet socks,

374
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:52,222
and go to sleep.

375
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:54,424
- That works?
- It does.

376
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:57,327
Please call now if you have
questions about tonight's gala

377
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:00,030
or one of my other
interests...

378
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:03,365
Woodworking,
uh, novels about tall ships,

379
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:06,069
meat,
that sort of thing.

380
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:08,522
I'm afraid
I have some very bad news.

381
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:12,857
"I, Chris Traeger, after several
sustained hours of diarrhea,

382
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:15,562
"combined with violent coughing
and a devastating fever,

383
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,064
"followed
by even more diarrhea,

384
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,250
have succumbed
to the avian flu."

385
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:22,603
I'm dead.

386
00:14:22,605 --> 00:14:24,087
I got to say, Leonard,
it kind of feels

387
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:25,589
like you're putting us
through the ringer here.

388
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:27,708
Can you us an idea
how long this is gonna take?

389
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,926
Uh...

390
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:30,344
Probably
six to eight more hours.

391
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,512
- Eight more hours?
- Nine.

392
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:34,181
Are all state emergency drills
this intensive?

393
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:37,434
Oh, no, hardly ever.
Councilman Jamm requested it.

394
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:38,769
Oh, really?

395
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,554
Specifically asked
that the drill to be done today

396
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:42,272
and said I should give you
everything I got.

397
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,390
Mmhmm.

398
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,424
Guys! Come here.

399
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:45,726
The game is rigged.

400
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:47,527
Jamm invited Leonard here,

401
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,763
and he screwed up the bus thing
on purpose to slow us down.

402
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,949
It is with a heavy heart
that I say,

403
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:53,784
"We have been jammed."

404
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:55,602
God, that guy is the worst!

405
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:58,655
Look, we are stuck in this room
until the drill is over.

406
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:01,074
What are we gonna do?
The only thing we can do.

407
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:03,794
In order
to save our park...

408
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:06,580
We have to destroy
the entire town.

409
00:15:07,404 --> 00:15:08,703
Ladies and gentlemen,

410
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:11,192
we are making some changes
to the Knope Protocol.

411
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,256
Ann, how much flu vaccine
does the hospital still have?

412
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,426
Enough for 2,000 people.

413
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:18,128
Great. Why don't you tell
the hospital director

414
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,813
- to flush them down the toilet.
- You got it.

415
00:15:19,815 --> 00:15:22,599
Chief Fugleberg, I want you
to order your officers

416
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:25,934
to find all the infected birds
in the area and perform CPR.

417
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:27,804
Sorry.
Won't they become infected?

418
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,022
That's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

419
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:32,857
Our top priority is now
saving all the birds.

420
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:35,646
And you know what? Why don't we
just kick this up a notch?

421
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,532
Oh, no!
Pawnee has been hit with...

422
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,033
A tornado quake!

423
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:43,237
This is Ron.
Go ahead, caller.

424
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,655
Hi.

425
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,658
My Yorkshire Terrier has chewed
up the legs on my kitchen table.

426
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,160
Is there a cheap way
to repair that?

427
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:51,578
Great question.

428
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,448
Take a walnut and rub it
into the legs of your table.

429
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,882
That'll mask the scratches.

430
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:58,168
Next thing you want to do
is ditch the Terrier

431
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,920
and get yourself
a proper dog.

432
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:02,105
Any dog under 50 pounds
is a cat,

433
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:03,406
and cats are pointless.

434
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,442
Come to the gala.
Next caller.

435
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:08,777
Grapes of Wrath, chocolate-chip
ice cream, and Johnny Cash.

436
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:11,765
Don't trust big banks
or small banks.

437
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:14,401
Banks are Ponzi schemes
run by morons.

438
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:16,970
Your house isn't haunted.
You're lonely.

439
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:19,372
Whatever happened to,
"Hey, I have some apples.

440
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:21,324
Would you like to buy them?"
"Yes, thank you."

441
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:23,143
That's as complicated
as it should be

442
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:25,061
to open a business
in this country.

443
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:27,414
I've seen three movies
in my life...

444
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,616
Bridge on the River Kwai,
Patton,

445
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:31,935
and Herbie Fully Loaded.

446
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:33,937
My girlfriend's kids love it.

447
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:35,906
It's pretty funny.

448
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:37,941
Next caller.

449
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,011
Good morning.

450
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,213
And... it is a wrap.

451
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:45,331
Everyone in Pawnee
is dead.

452
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,333
Including
Councilman Jamm.

453
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:50,136
What?
No, no, you can't do that.

454
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:51,271
It says right there,
you're dead,

455
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:53,106
so is everyone
you care about.

456
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:55,174
Oh, well,
joke's on you.

457
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,143
I don't have anyone
I care about.

458
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:58,395
Ms. Knope, I'm afraid

459
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,647
I have to once again
give Pawnee a failing grade.

460
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,366
This was bad...
Fort Wayne bad.

461
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:05,518
Bummer.
Thank you for your time.

462
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,903
I think we're done here.

463
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:09,623
I will see everyone at the gala,
and I will see you in hell.

464
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:12,292
Yeah, you're too late, Knope.
That lot is mine.

465
00:17:12,294 --> 00:17:13,910
I can't hear you.
I'm a ghost.

466
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:16,213
Yeah, well, so am I,
so you can hear me!

467
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:17,530
Ghost jammed!

468
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,050
We got all the way
to Muncie

469
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,219
before we realized
that it was just a drill.

470
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:25,038
I mean, all I'm saying is
you could've called.

471
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,756
No one had your cell number, Big "J."

472
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:27,924
I find that hard to believe.

473
00:17:27,926 --> 00:17:29,226
Oh, my God,
why is everyone standing around?

474
00:17:29,228 --> 00:17:30,877
We have work to do.
Status report.

475
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,145
- Status report!
- Well...

476
00:17:32,147 --> 00:17:33,379
Nope, we don't have time for that.

477
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,714
We're gonna
have to postpone the gala,

478
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:36,215
but we can't, because
the deadline is tomorrow.

479
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:38,151
Oh, my God, I destroyed
the entire town for nothing.

480
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:40,219
Leslie, it's okay.

481
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:46,440
Oh, my God.
You did all this?

482
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:48,394
How did you get food?

483
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,947
I had a classic stroke
of Haverford genius.

484
00:17:50,949 --> 00:17:53,083
Who has the most to lose
from a new Paunch Burger?

485
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:54,217
Their competitors.

486
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,586
I got all the other
fast-food places in town

487
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,071
to donate food.

488
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:00,239
I know black tie and chicky
tenders isn't the best mix,

489
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,375
- but...
- No, Tom, I love it.

490
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:05,710
And more importantly, so will
all of our more ample citizens.

491
00:18:05,764 --> 00:18:07,080
How did you
get the word out?

492
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:09,916
Well, Ron went on Joan's show
and kicked ass.

493
00:18:09,918 --> 00:18:12,552
I also helped a child
perform a tracheotomy

494
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:14,087
on his elderly uncle.

495
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:16,022
It's been
a very rewarding day.

496
00:18:16,024 --> 00:18:19,059
Also, I told the firemen they
should use the lot as triage

497
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:21,611
and then gave them
and all the dead and wounded

498
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:23,730
- two free drink tickets.
- Wow.

499
00:18:24,032 --> 00:18:27,065
This is great.
Thank you so much.

500
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:29,119
Let's start the gala.

501
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:32,454
Oh, and thanks
for dressing up, Jerry.

502
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,550
- Hello, Chief Fugleberg.
- Hey.

503
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,468
That's your buddy Andy Dwyer
over there, isn't it?

504
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,787
- Such a shame.
- Oh, no.

505
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:49,956
- Did he fail his test?
- It's weird.

506
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,758
He got 100%
on his written test...

507
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,310
first guy in history
to do it...

508
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,795
but he failed
his personality examination.

509
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:57,230
He's a sweet kid...

510
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:58,898
just doesn't have
what it takes to be a cop.

511
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,233
Oh, Andy.

512
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:03,302
Too bad. He's certainly
something of a genius.

513
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:05,605
We could use his brains
on the force.

514
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:08,047
Official police wrist lock.
You can't hit me. Try to hit me.

515
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,111
Or here, no, try...
it's this hand.

516
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:13,246
Wrist lock. Boom, too much pain,
you can't even hit me.

517
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:14,647
Try to hit me.

518
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,366
If I had my gun, you wouldn't
try to hit me, though,

519
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:17,784
is the thing.

520
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:20,486
Uh, if I could have
everyone's attention please?

521
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:23,656
I am so happy to announce
that as of one minute ago,

522
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:25,625
we have reached
our fund-raising goal.

523
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:31,880
Every dollar spent here tonight
by you, the community,

524
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:34,667
will be poured right back
into this wonderful project.

525
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:36,603
And speaking of community,

526
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:39,672
I'd like to thank my community...
my friends.

527
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:42,308
It's a lesson that I have
learned over and over again,

528
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,509
but it bears repeating...

529
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:45,178
No one achieves anything alone.

530
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:49,315
Without further ado,
the best band in Pawnee...

531
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:50,316
Mouse Rat.

532
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,186
♪ Park

533
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:56,521
♪ we will build it,
the park ♪

534
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,743
♪ it's not built yet,
the park ♪

535
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:03,078
♪ soon there will be a park

536
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:04,881
Thank you.

537
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:06,249
♪ Park

538
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:09,584
I thought you should see
why Leslie tanked the drill.

539
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:12,705
Councilman Jamm used you
as a stalling tactic,

540
00:20:12,707 --> 00:20:16,040
hoping it would kill
Leslie's park project.

541
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,478
If the test were any other day,
Leslie would have aced it.

542
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,896
I believe you.

543
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:22,732
Maybe I'll find my way back here
in a month for a re-do.

544
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:24,434
I appreciate it.

545
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,987
Have you ever thought
of being a sperm donor?

546
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,189
I'm impotent.

547
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:30,389
Yeah, I don't need
to know that.

548
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:32,992
This is
the best wedding present ever.

549
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:34,411
This is
the best night ever.

550
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:35,528
I wish we were getting married
tonight.

551
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,247
Well, we only have
three more months.

552
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,082
I can't wait
three more months.

553
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:41,918
God, I just hate the feeling
of not being married to you.

554
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:45,004
Well...

555
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:48,339
Let's just do it, then.

556
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,845
Let's get married...
Here, tonight.

557
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:53,930
I mean,
we're all in black tie.

558
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:57,265
We've got plenty of food
and entertainment...

559
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,602
And you did want to invite
the whole town

560
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:01,387
to the wedding, right?

561
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:04,722
Leslie...

562
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:07,593
Let's get married...
Tonight.

563
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:15,609
Breaking news...
I've just been handed this.

564
00:21:16,147 --> 00:21:18,598
Pawnee has been hit
by a devastating earthquake.

565
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:20,717
We go to our reporter, live,

566
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:23,353
Winnifred Makepiece,
for the story. Winnifred?

567
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:26,323
Thanks, Jessica. I'm here
at the Pawnee Weather Center

568
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,558
with celebrated geologist
Isabella Winchester.

569
00:21:28,576 --> 00:21:30,894
Isabella, can you tell us more
about this killer earthquake?

570
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:32,245
That's right, Winnifred,

571
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,798
the earthquake registered
an 8.5 on the Richter scale.

572
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:36,399
That's correct.
It was a large one.

573
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,185
Thank you so much,
everyone.

574
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:40,504
From all of us here
at Channel 4 News,

575
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:42,089
I'm Jessica Rabrit.

576
00:21:42,123 --> 00:21:45,208
Have a good evening
and be safe out there.

577
