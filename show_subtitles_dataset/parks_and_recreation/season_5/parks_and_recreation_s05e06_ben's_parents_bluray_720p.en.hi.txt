1
00:00:01,525 --> 00:00:02,724
It's so beautiful

2
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:03,726
- and sparkly.
- I know.

3
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:06,524
And it's a nonconflict diamond.

4
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:08,726
When Andy proposed to me,
he gave me a ring pop,

5
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:11,029
but then he ate it first.
How did Ben do it?

6
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:12,513
Let me start
from the beginning.

7
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:14,348
- Uh-oh.
- In 1832,

8
00:00:14,366 --> 00:00:18,185
Ben's great-great-great-great-
grandfather, Teodore Wyatt,

9
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:20,872
a bastard, met a beautiful
seamstress from Antwerp.

10
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:22,240
Ben and I are getting married,
and I've been telling

11
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:23,625
everybody about it.

12
00:00:23,659 --> 00:00:25,209
I'm so happy, I want
to shout it from the rooftops.

13
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:26,411
And she has.

14
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,496
We've gotten
several noise complaints.

15
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:31,165
- We're getting married!
- All right.

16
00:00:31,183 --> 00:00:34,552
Mm, the joy
that I am feeling

17
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:38,723
right now is profound
and unmatched in the modern era.

18
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:40,858
And I can't tell you
what it means to me

19
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:43,177
that I'm the very first person
that you chose to tell.

20
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:44,312
Oh...

21
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:47,365
Let me walk around
with you

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,683
as you tell everyone else

23
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:53,705
so that I can share true joy
being spread, please?

24
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:55,123
Hey, everyone!

25
00:00:55,157 --> 00:00:57,158
We have something
very exciting to tell you

26
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:58,876
that you have
never heard before.

27
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,161
- Ben and I are engaged...
- What?

28
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:01,329
And you're hearing about it

29
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:02,997
for the very first time
right now.

30
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,634
Come on, everybody!
How about a little excitement?

31
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:07,702
Leslie and Ben
are engaged!

32
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,253
Nothing will ever come
between them!

33
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:10,838
Leslie and Ben are...

34
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,557
What's going on?

35
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:13,558
Leslie and Ben are engaged!

36
00:01:14,592 --> 00:01:16,678
Again?

37
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:17,812
- You guys!
- Oh.

38
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:18,896
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah!

39
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,715
Aah!

40
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:28,336
Sync & corrections by Alice
www.addic7ed.com

41
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,454
- Okay, T-minus six hours
until the engagement party.

42
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:45,923
Has you-know-who
responded yet?

43
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,793
Surprisingly, no,
Larry Bird has not RSVP'd yet.

44
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:50,178
Well, he kind of waits
until the last minute.

45
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:51,746
That's his style.
Put him down as a "maybe."

46
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:53,181
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, totally.

47
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,049
I-I just have
two small requests.

48
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:57,418
One, put Twizzlers
on the candy table,

49
00:01:57,436 --> 00:02:00,521
and two,
cancel the party

50
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:01,773
because you invited
my parents,

51
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:04,108
and they can't be
in the same room together.

52
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:05,593
Okay?
Great, thank you.

53
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:08,229
No to canceling the party,
and no to Twizzlers.

54
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:10,031
We are a Red Vines family.

55
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:11,115
You're gonna have
to get used to that.

56
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,284
I know you're scared,
but I love you,

57
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:15,286
and this party
is gonna go great.

58
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,771
Well, if there's anyone

59
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:19,440
who can bring my parents
together,

60
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,908
it's no one.

61
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,611
No one can ever
bring them together.

62
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,329
My family situation
is complicated.

63
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,115
My parents got divorced
30 years ago

64
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,968
and they hate each other.

65
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:33,304
Okay, I guess it's not
that complicated.

66
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:36,924
Okay! You guys pretend
you're Ron Swanson,

67
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,509
and you're trying to decide

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,144
whether you want
to invest in this company.

69
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:41,779
Be super critical.

70
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:42,914
You're short.

71
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:45,249
And here... we... go!

72
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:50,588
Tom Haverford
and Jean-Ralphio Saperstein...

73
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:53,508
Creators
of Entertainment 720...

74
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:55,676
Proudly present...

75
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:59,079
- Rent A Swag!
- Wah!

76
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,932
Parents, are you tired
of watching

77
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:02,416
your middle-school-aged
children grow out

78
00:03:02,434 --> 00:03:04,435
of the nice clothes
you buy for them?

79
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,471
Then rent them!
From Rent A Swag.

80
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:07,889
I own it.

81
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:10,725
You rent it.
You wear it.

82
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,110
You clean it.
You return it.

83
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:14,946
I get rich.
Wink!

84
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,096
Rent A Swag!

85
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,231
♪ Where your swag
is my business! ♪

86
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:18,900
Okay, stop.
You guys, stop!

87
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,034
Stop!

88
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,268
♪ And your business
is my swag ♪

89
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,770
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

90
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,655
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Please..

91
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,741
There's actually
a lot more,

92
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:28,359
but tell us
your thoughts so far.

93
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,211
It's the greatest thing I've
ever seen in my entire life.

94
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:31,946
- Yes!
- No! It's terrible.

95
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,698
It's terrible,
you guys.

96
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:35,149
I love you, baby.
You're so smart.

97
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,001
You're presenting this
to Ron Swanson.

98
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,653
Don't talk about any
of your old, failed businesses,

99
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:41,172
get rid
of that stupid light show,

100
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:43,324
and definitely don't use
any weird, made-up words

101
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,959
that Ron doesn't understand.

102
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:46,761
But the presentation's
tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

103
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,296
We don't have time
to start from scratch.

104
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,183
Well, if you do any of that,
he's not gonna invest, so...

105
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:54,519
Your funeral.

106
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:55,720
Hey!
I'm glad you're here.

107
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,171
Let's go over the plan.

108
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,008
Okay, you and I go stargazing
in Harvey James park,

109
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:03,611
while my parents
slowly strangle each other

110
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:04,896
in the living room.

111
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:07,848
- No.
Your mom arrives at 7:00.

112
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:10,201
We hand her a glass
of chilled white wine,

113
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,403
and, oh, look,
my mom is walking over,

114
00:04:12,454 --> 00:04:14,288
and they're both
educators and mothers.

115
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:16,040
What a fabulous coincidence.

116
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:18,326
Then later, Stephen Wyatt
shows up... that's your dad.

117
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,911
Yes.
He's terrifying.

118
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:21,379
We make some small talk,

119
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:22,863
and 30 minutes later,

120
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:26,417
I show everybody
the big surprise.

121
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:28,035
The Knope-Wyatt unity quilt.

122
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:29,387
Ben and I are weaving
our lives together,

123
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:31,255
so I have woven this quilt.

124
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:35,560
It represents every member
of our new united family.

125
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,511
Of all my metaphorical
art projects,

126
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,546
this is by far
the coziest.

127
00:04:39,565 --> 00:04:41,766
- This is amazing.
- I know.

128
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:43,050
I worked really hard on it.

129
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:44,485
And, out of respect,

130
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,720
I did not include any images
of the only other man

131
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:48,889
in the world
who's as sexy as you, Joe Biden.

132
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:50,358
- Yes, you did, right there.
- Hmm?

133
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:52,777
Oh, well,
that's just a little one.

134
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:55,363
The point is, this quilt is
going to unite the Wyatt clan.

135
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:59,233
It's beautiful,
and it won't.

136
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,086
Everyone,
before everyone else gets here,

137
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,372
I'd like to make
a little toast.

138
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:08,125
My romantic life has been
a bit of a mixed bag lately.

139
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:11,929
And when that's the case,
it's hard not to be cynical

140
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:14,248
about love and relationships,
but it's couples like you

141
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,749
that give hope
to the rest of us.

142
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:19,270
Leslie, you deserve the best,
and you found it.

143
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:22,423
Ben, don't you dare hurt her.

144
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:23,557
I won't.

145
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,926
Don't laugh.
She means it.

146
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:27,311
Okay, I-I won't.

147
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:29,947
Seriously, son,
don't hurt her.

148
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,066
Okay, I'm not planning
on hurting her.

149
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,085
- You better not be.
- I'm not!

150
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,787
Hey, Ben,
you best watch yourself.

151
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,339
Why would any of you think
I would hurt Leslie?

152
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:40,240
You're all my friends too.

153
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,626
Nah.

154
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:43,294
This was literally

155
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:46,180
the most beautiful
and moving thing

156
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:49,750
that I have ever heard.

157
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,085
There, there,
baby boy.

158
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:55,089
Take all the time you need.

159
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,808
Well, sure, in a wrestling
match, Kirk would win.

160
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,593
But overall, who would you
rather have at the helm

161
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:01,779
of your
Sovereign-class starship?

162
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,531
Jean-Luc Picard.
No contest.

163
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:04,765
Hey, your mom's here.
I need you.

164
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,117
Thank God.

165
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:08,319
- There's my boy!
- Hey, Mom.

166
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,570
Nice to see you.

167
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,789
This is Leslie Knope,
my fiancee.

168
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:14,108
Hi. It's... it's really nice
to finally meet you, Ms. Wyatt.

169
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:15,576
Oh! Please call me Julia.

170
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,611
Is your father here yet?

171
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,331
- No fighting tonight, Mom.
- Don't worry!

172
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:21,749
I'm going to be civil,
as long as he is.

173
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:24,335
Frankly, after what he did
at Geoffrey's graduation...

174
00:06:24,386 --> 00:06:26,420
Oh, I have some white wine
for you, some Chardonnay.

175
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,506
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

176
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:31,092
Right this way.

177
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:36,597
- Hey, you guys, come on in.
- Thank you.

178
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:41,969
Ann.

179
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:43,104
Hey.

180
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:44,989
You all right, man?

181
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:47,241
The toast that you gave
to Ben and Leslie

182
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:48,359
was so beautiful,

183
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,946
and I'm feeling very raw
from my therapy.

184
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,817
I am so happy...
And so sad.

185
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:59,954
It's like a perfect storm
of emotions.

186
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:05,459
And so I'm hiding out here,
so I don't ruin this party

187
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,995
for my two amazing
best friends

188
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:10,431
who I love so much.

189
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:11,549
Oh!

190
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,001
There's no more tissue.

191
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,502
- Everything ends!
- No, no, no.

192
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,221
No, there's more tissue.

193
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:21,025
- There's...
- Everything goes away.

194
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:22,977
And I said,
rules or no rules,

195
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,278
I just have to kiss
that beautiful face.

196
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,847
Well, that's
a Knope woman for you.

197
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,649
When we see something adorable,
we attack it.

198
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:31,351
He is adorable,
isn't he?

199
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,537
You chose well, Benny.

200
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,573
Aw, thank you.

201
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:36,690
So far, so good.

202
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,825
I'll admit it.

203
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,076
Things are going
surprisingly well.

204
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,461
Yeah.

205
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:41,796
And pack it up.
It's over, we're screwed.

206
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,130
He brought his girlfriend?

207
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:44,582
He wasn't supposed
to bring his girlfriend, Ben.

208
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,133
Oh, Ben!

209
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:48,052
Your father brought
his little plaything.

210
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:49,703
- Hiya, Benny.
- Hey, Dad, hi.

211
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,256
Hi.

212
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:53,373
Unh.

213
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,042
Hi, Ulani.

214
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,844
Thought you weren't coming.

215
00:07:56,878 --> 00:08:00,064
Ulani is my girlfriend,
and she's important to me,

216
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:01,398
and I need her here.

217
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,734
Ulani, hi, I'm Leslie.
What a wonderful surprise.

218
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:05,402
We're so happy
that you're here.

219
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:07,738
What the hell, Steve?
They didn't know I was coming?

220
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:10,724
We didn't know
it was spring break.

221
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:11,942
Okay, thanks, everybody,
for coming.

222
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,661
I'm so sorry
you all have to go home.

223
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:16,247
Hey, Red Vines anyone?

224
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:19,283
We're a Twizzlers family.

225
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,804
Okay, we are off to a rocky start,

226
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,304
but we are gonna fix this.

227
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,723
Yes, we will.
I called a cab.

228
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:27,756
It's outside.

229
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,476
I gave the driver 100 bucks
to sit and wait,

230
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,978
so whenever
we're ready to go...

231
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,179
like, maybe right now...

232
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,931
all we have to do
is walk outside.

233
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,851
No, I want to be here now,
with you and your parents.

234
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,052
Help me make this work.

235
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,154
Okay, fine.
Best thing to do is

236
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,189
distract them
with innocuous talk

237
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,492
- about the stuff they care about.
- Great, like what?

238
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,694
Well, they're white people
from Minnesota,

239
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,030
so hockey, fishing, skiing,
sailing, and after a few drinks,

240
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,531
put on a Prince album.

241
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,083
Don't mention
the Green Bay Packers

242
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,234
or the state of Iowa.
And also,

243
00:08:56,252 --> 00:08:57,503
I have enough
frequent flyer miles

244
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,254
to get us to Australia
tonight.

245
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,673
- Everything okay?
- Uh, slight speed bump.

246
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,676
Everything is terrible,
but I am going to fix it

247
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,877
with my secret weapon.

248
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,411
Okay, well I will make sure

249
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:07,579
that everything else
runs smoothly.

250
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,014
Ann, you are such
a good friend.

251
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,751
You are a beautiful, talented,
brilliant, powerful musk ox.

252
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,688
Thank you, ox,
for keeping this ship afloat.

253
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,306
You got it.

254
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:19,725
Guys, I need your help,
okay?

255
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,944
Chris is in the back room,
and he's crying.

256
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,595
Go in there, calm him down,
make him feel better.

257
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,948
Leslie and Ben have enough
to deal with, okay?

258
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,816
Thank you.
Wait, why is Chris crying?

259
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,320
- Uh, he's emotional.
- Wait, why is Chris emotional?

260
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,288
Because he's
in therapy right now,

261
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,707
and it's dredging up
a lot of stuff for him.

262
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,875
Wait, wait,
like what kind of stuff?

263
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,744
Like, I don't know,
his friends are getting married,

264
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,112
and he's not
dating anyone.

265
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,081
Why isn't
he dating anyone?

266
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,116
Yeah, why don't you
date him?

267
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,218
Because I'm dating myself
right now, okay?

268
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,971
I'm... I'm trying to figure out
how to make me happy.

269
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,455
Ugh, why is it always
about you, Ann?

270
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:51,673
Self-centered much?

271
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,962
Just go, okay?
Thank you.

272
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,180
- Ron in 60 seconds.
- Tom.

273
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,648
I haven't seen you tonight.

274
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,067
I've been working
on my presentation.

275
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,402
I just came by
to congratulate Leslie,

276
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,570
and then I'm heading back.

277
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,155
I admire
the work ethic.

278
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,407
I'm always looking
for new investments.

279
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,976
Ever since I got my first job
at the age of nine,

280
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:13,162
I have put
all my money into gold,

281
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,313
which is currently
at an all-time high.

282
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:20,919
So I have
a certain amount of money.

283
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,088
I've said too much.

284
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,257
Looking forward
to tomorrow.

285
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,009
Yes...
About that.

286
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,045
I was wondering, is there
any chance we could reschedule?

287
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,547
I just want to make sure
everything is up

288
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,848
to my world-class "standees."

289
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,634
I like to keep
my appointments, son,

290
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,102
and I like others
to do the same.

291
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,355
Of course, yes.
No problem, 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

292
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,608
I think you're gonna be
very impressed

293
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,276
with our presentation.

294
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,396
"Our presentation"?
Who else is joining you?

295
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,730
Ricka ricka ricka ricka!

296
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,517
Swanson.

297
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,352
- Jean-Ralphio.
- That's me.

298
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,622
I didn't realize
you were a part of this.

299
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,207
Of course he is.
He's my business partner.

300
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,627
Shh! Clean!

301
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,579
Business partner,
now and forever.

302
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,531
Hold up!
Forever 21.

303
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,550
21-gun salute.
Salute your shorts.

304
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,868
Kaboosh!

305
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,720
I just free-associated
all over the "mousse-tache."

306
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,538
That's just one
of many skills he brings

307
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:14,706
to this business partnership.

308
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:16,425
What are those, shrimp?
Ah!

309
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,895
Okay.
Rethink that move, son.

310
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,547
Let's just drive back.
I feel weird.

311
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:25,150
Steve, you like sailing,
right?

312
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,019
Not any more, since Julia
got the boat in the divorce

313
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,887
and then sold it
to a scrapyard

314
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,722
because she's terrible.

315
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,890
Well, at least
you don't have to deal

316
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,826
with all that boat upkeep now,
right, huh?

317
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,160
Yech, no thankee.

318
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,279
Let's talk about something
other than sailing.

319
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,497
Why don't you head
in the other room?

320
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,083
I have a surprise that...
there she goes.

321
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,585
There's a surprise for you,
so, um, head on in.

322
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,504
I don't like surprises.

323
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,839
Okay, look,
you gave it a try,

324
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,458
but this quilt thing
is not going to work.

325
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,176
Ben, on three separate occasions,

326
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,378
I have used a quilt
to mend fences.

327
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,297
In ninth grade,
a quilt ended an argument

328
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,581
between my two best friends,

329
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,433
and a quilt settled

330
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,936
the Donna-Jerry
parking lot feud of 2006.

331
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,420
What was the third time?

332
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,422
Right [Bleep] now.

333
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,024
Okay, I still don't think
it's gonna work,

334
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,943
but I am really attracted
to you right now.

335
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,280
I know.
Let's do this.

336
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,431
Police, open up!
We have a warrant!

337
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:14,533
Just kidding, it's us.

338
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,652
- Ha, we got you!
- Andy and April.

339
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:17,936
We have someone
who wants to see you!

340
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,454
Champion!

341
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,323
Come here.
Hey, big boy.

342
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,608
You are such
a brave, good dog,

343
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,043
with so much spirit.

344
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,328
You've overcome so much.

345
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:31,049
You are the most wonderful dog
in the whole world.

346
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,634
And I am so happy for you.

347
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:36,838
Okay, everyone, I have
a surprise for all of you.

348
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,840
Voila!

349
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:42,460
The Knope-Wyatt unity quilt!

350
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:45,797
It represents our two families
coming together,

351
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:47,465
and there is a personalized
square for each member

352
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:49,685
of our joint family, see?

353
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,237
- Sweetheart, this is lovely.
- Thanks, Mom.

354
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,573
Where's my square?

355
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,141
Well,
you're not technically...

356
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,744
- Not technically what?
- Not technically an adult.

357
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,496
This is a very thoughtless
omission, Leslie,

358
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,482
and as far as I'm concerned,
if there's no Ulani square,

359
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,868
this is not
a legitimate unity quilt.

360
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,921
- Oh, that old Chestnut.
- Okay.

361
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,157
I will make
an Ulani square.

362
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:14,826
Very, very easy.
Okay.

363
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:16,211
Look, this is your square now.

364
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,679
What does "Ulani" mean?

365
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,181
"Cheerful."

366
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,716
Sure.

367
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,552
All right.
Look at that.

368
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,504
Unity! It's that simple.
All we had to do was...

369
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:28,173
I don't want her name
on my quilt.

370
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,342
It's not your...
it's everyone's quilt.

371
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,843
It's a unity quilt.

372
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:34,112
I think it's mean that
you didn't do a square for me.

373
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,614
It's a disaster
is what it is.

374
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,199
You can say that again,
Steve.

375
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,184
See, Ben,
they're agreeing.

376
00:13:39,202 --> 00:13:40,569
It's working.

377
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,737
Okay, I'm thinking

378
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,489
we junk everything
except the mannequins.

379
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,024
Ron's gotta see how dope
the outfits are.

380
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:47,376
That's the business.

381
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,911
Why are we going to Ron?
Ron should be coming to us!

382
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,546
We created
Entertainment 720.

383
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,748
Which was
a huge failure.

384
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,966
I don't know...

385
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,533
Look, a bank's
not gonna give us a loan,

386
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:59,004
and Ron loves
my entrepreneurial spirit.

387
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,089
Trust me, he's our best chance
at getting start-up money.

388
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,758
I hear that.
Let's go clubbing.

389
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,226
No, we gotta work.

390
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,227
Didn't you hear me say
we gotta junk

391
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,378
most of the presentation?

392
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:08,847
Tommy, I will always
be there for you,

393
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,565
no matter what,
but right now,

394
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,068
I cannot be there for you
because I have to go.

395
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,821
I hate to say this, but...

396
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,408
Sometimes you've gotta work
a little,

397
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,743
so you can ball a lot.

398
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,229
That was beautiful.

399
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:28,733
That changed me.
I'll give you ten minutes.

400
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:31,169
You have to try
to eat something, okay?

401
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:37,793
Mmm!
Wow, that's amazing.

402
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:40,962
See? There you go.

403
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,431
This one's not as good.

404
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,016
All right, Chris,
here's the plan.

405
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,967
I'm just gonna list off
happy things

406
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,886
until you're cheered up.

407
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,189
Pizza, the beach,
rock and roll music...

408
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,275
- and I'll list terrible things
to bring you back down.

409
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,777
Smallpox,
botched surgery,

410
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,946
snails crawling
out of your mouth.

411
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,449
This is weirdly working.
It's evening me out.

412
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,734
- Okay, keep going, keep going.
- Laughter.

413
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:03,768
Snails crawling
out of your mouth.

414
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:04,786
- The beach.
- Snails crawling out

415
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,555
- out of your mouth.
- Cute cats.

416
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:07,823
Snails crawling
out of your butt.

417
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,491
Dave Matthews Band.

418
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,126
Dave Matthews Band.

419
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,046
Look, Dad, Leslie worked
really hard on this,

420
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,498
so can you just cool it
for, like, 30 seconds?

421
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,884
Sure, I can.

422
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,785
But your mother can't.
See?

423
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:23,288
She's ruining your quilt,

424
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:25,006
just like she ruined
our marriage!

425
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,258
Mom!

426
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,625
Oh, I didn't know
we could cut that.

427
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:28,727
It had to be done, Ben.

428
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,179
It absolutely
did not have to be done.

429
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,231
Look, champagne!

430
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,966
Yeah, why don't we
just forget about the quilt

431
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:37,602
- and just raise a glass?
- Yes! Toasts are fun.

432
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,521
They usually signify
the end of a party.

433
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,638
Here you are, Ulani.

434
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:41,907
I'm good, thanks.

435
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,408
Oh, by all means,
go ahead and take it, Ulani.

436
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,310
Or, wait, are you even
old enough to drink?

437
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:47,112
Yes, Julia, I am,

438
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,415
but I can't
because I'm pregnant.

439
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,533
You're what?

440
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:52,868
Oh, boy.

441
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,252
I didn't mean
to steal your spotlight,

442
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,487
but the cat's
out of the bag.

443
00:15:55,505 --> 00:16:00,125
Young Ben is going to have
a new baby sister, huh?

444
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,994
Still firing bullets, son.

445
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:04,713
I cannot be
in the same room as him.

446
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,014
What about the wedding?

447
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,167
I'm talking
about the wedding.

448
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,804
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Wyatt family.

449
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:16,711
It's like the war of the Wyatts out there!

450
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:19,681
- I mean, it's so brutal!
- Oh, my God.

451
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:20,982
Were you and Dad
ever like that?

452
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,134
Well,
like any married couple,

453
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:25,119
honey, your father and I
fought occasionally,

454
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:27,805
and sometimes
he won the argument,

455
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,424
and sometimes I won.

456
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:32,010
But usually, we forgot
what we were arguing about

457
00:16:32,044 --> 00:16:33,311
and just had sex.

458
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,212
- La la la la la.
- Anyway, the important thing

459
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,067
is that we always ended up
on the same team.

460
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,601
And in the same bed.

461
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,905
God, I miss that man.

462
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,690
How can you be so wise
and so inappropriate

463
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:47,391
at the same time?

464
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,727
I'm a parent.

465
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,447
I can't figure out how to phrase
this mission statement.

466
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:53,748
Let me get a shot at it.

467
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:54,899
I'm actually pretty good
at this stuff.

468
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,336
See?

469
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,338
You just googled,
"Amanda Bynes side boob."

470
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:01,706
What's wrong with you?

471
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,591
What's wrong with you?
Why is your safesearch on?

472
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,461
That is amateur hour, Tom.

473
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:09,180
Listen, we've been at this
for an entire evening.

474
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:10,965
I say, why don't
we cut our losses?

475
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:13,518
If it was such a good idea,
we would be millionaires by now.

476
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:14,602
Hello.

477
00:17:14,636 --> 00:17:16,387
Look, man,
I believe in this idea.

478
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:18,940
Do you?

479
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:21,092
You know
I love you, but...

480
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,977
I don't think you're as serious
about this business as I am.

481
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:26,597
Oh, yeah, no,
I'm definitely not.

482
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:40,995
Hey, I got your text.
What are you doing?

483
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:42,964
I grabbed all of the brownies
from the dessert table

484
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,215
and four bottles of wine.

485
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:45,466
Get in the car.
We're going to Australia.

486
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:47,335
- Leslie...
- I am so sorry for everything.

487
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:49,721
I love you,
and I want to be on your team.

488
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,339
I am on your team,
but I think that

489
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,974
our team should be
far away from here.

490
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:55,143
Normally, I would get
in the cab with you,

491
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:58,295
but I am so sick of them
ruining everything,

492
00:17:58,313 --> 00:18:00,181
and I really liked
that unity quilt.

493
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:02,934
- It was a good quilt.
- It was an awesome quilt.

494
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:05,236
Look, my parents are insane,

495
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,572
but they need to be
at our wedding.

496
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:08,906
You know what?

497
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,575
It's time for this team

498
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:12,276
- to come up with a new plan.
- I agree.

499
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,412
Phase one of our new plan,
you get in the backseat

500
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:16,697
of this cab, and we hardcore
make out for 15 minutes.

501
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:18,082
I would love
to do that.

502
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:19,917
I'm just not sure if the driver
would be okay with it.

503
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:22,453
For another 100 bucks,
you can do whatever you want.

504
00:18:22,987 --> 00:18:24,455
Let's do this.

505
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,209
Swan song!

506
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,627
What up, my man?

507
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:32,180
- Ow, are you kidding me?
- Jean-Ralphio.

508
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:34,465
I thought you and Tom were
working on your presentation.

509
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:37,435
No, I decided it was best
if I took my talents elsewhere.

510
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:39,637
- Do you know what I mean?
- You abandoned your friend?

511
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,639
God, no.
He fired me, straight up.

512
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:43,441
Talked about how I
wasn't serious enough

513
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:44,508
about the project,

514
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:46,110
how he needed to grow up.

515
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:48,563
Anyway, I have an amazing
investment idea for you.

516
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:50,531
Condoms with pictures
on them.

517
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:51,783
- Pass.
- Good. Smart.

518
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,117
I think you made
the right decision.

519
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:55,686
Take care.

520
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:58,289
Oh. Chris?

521
00:18:58,323 --> 00:19:01,125
Seems like the storm has passed.
Indeed it has.

522
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,494
I can't believe that I spent
the entire party in a room

523
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:06,214
being happy-sad
on a night that means so much

524
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:07,498
to my two best friends.

525
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:08,866
I mean,
you're going through a lot.

526
00:19:08,884 --> 00:19:11,302
You need to purge all this stuff
that's been building up.

527
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:13,638
This lesbian nurse
is right, Chris.

528
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:15,539
You can't keep it
all bottled up.

529
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:17,725
Maybe you're right.
Maybe all of my emotions

530
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,178
tumbling out like this means
that I can get a clean start.

531
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:21,712
Well, for that,
you're gonna have to visit

532
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,713
the bathroom first.

533
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:24,015
- Right?
- No.

534
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:25,382
- Ann Perkins!
- Nope.

535
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,186
You are, without a doubt,
the queen of toilet humor.

536
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,773
That's all
I ever wanted to be.

537
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:35,209
This was supposed to be
a happy occasion.

538
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:36,944
You were
supposed to come here,

539
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:40,164
celebrate your son's engagement,
maybe bury the ax?

540
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,465
And not
in each other's back.

541
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,902
But it did not
work out that way.

542
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,337
So here is the new plan.

543
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:48,105
I don't expect you
to like each other,

544
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,241
but you have to come
to the wedding, okay?

545
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,742
We'll seat you far away
from each other.

546
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,927
You don't even
have to socialize.

547
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,795
Yeah, in fact,
we insist that you don't.

548
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:56,580
But you do have
to show up

549
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:58,082
and tell us
that you had a great time.

550
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,433
That's the deal.

551
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,752
You can either take it,
or you can take it.

552
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,421
I can take it.
I'm sorry.

553
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:07,358
- I'm sorry too, Benny.
- Sorry. Whatever.

554
00:20:07,392 --> 00:20:09,110
Aw,
what a beautiful apology.

555
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:10,261
- Julia...
- Guys.

556
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,262
Sorry.

557
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,030
Ben's parents are insane,

558
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:14,198
but he is not.
He's amazing.

559
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:16,484
And that's all that matters.

560
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,786
I guess he might
become insane as he ages.

561
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,873
I should keep an eye out
for that.

562
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:23,624
Also, for the record,
my unity quilt worked.

563
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:26,627
So technically, I am three
for three with unity quilts.

564
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:27,795
We only have
30 bucks left.

565
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:28,963
Let's go.
Oh, okay.

566
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:30,331
Get ready, driver.

567
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:32,800
We're gonna make out so hard
in the back of your cab.

568
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,780
Are you okay, son?
Did you get any sleep?

569
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:42,527
Uh, not really.
I stayed up most of the night.

570
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,863
But that's not important.

571
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,832
Let me tell you
about Rent A Swag.

572
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:48,999
- Now...
- No need, Tom.

573
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,584
I'm in.

574
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:53,320
I like doing business
with serious people,

575
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:56,774
and when you removed yourself
from the company of that moron,

576
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:59,276
you showed me
you're a serious person.

577
00:20:59,278 --> 00:21:01,295
- You have your start-up money.
- Wow.

578
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:03,614
I appreciate it.

579
00:21:03,616 --> 00:21:04,799
Tommy "T"!

580
00:21:04,801 --> 00:21:07,385
You just missed the craziest
of crazies.

581
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:09,303
Clubs. Girls. Dancing.

582
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:11,806
Naked. Mom? Argument.

583
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:14,425
Police. Fleeing the scene.
Hiding in a Dumpster.

584
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:15,626
Coming here.

585
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:17,311
Crashing on your couch
for a week 'cause

586
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:19,764
♪ technically,
I'm homeless ♪

587
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,232
Hey, "mousse-tache."
I'ma hit the couch.

588
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:22,966
You know where I be.

589
