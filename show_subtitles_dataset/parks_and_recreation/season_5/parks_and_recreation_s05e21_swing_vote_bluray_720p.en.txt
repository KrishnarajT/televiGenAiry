1
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,685
Hey!
What the hell is this?

2
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:08,785
I'm guessing it's my latest
budget cut proposal

3
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:10,685
based on your rage sweat.

4
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:12,385
First of all,
I am rage glowing.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,304
Second, you wanna cut funding

6
00:00:14,338 --> 00:00:16,156
for the Pawnee Palms
Public Putt-Putt?

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,442
What did
the P.P.P.P.P. ever do to you?

8
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,844
Ron is very anti-government,
and he has that philosophy,

9
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:22,295
but there are just certain
things that you don't cut.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,315
Schools, police, mini-golf,
merry-go-rounds, parades,

11
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:27,650
gazebo repair,
roads and bridges, whatever.

12
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:29,686
Pretty gardens,
hummingbird feeders.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,672
I believe in cutting
useless government projects.

14
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:34,974
I also believe
in cutting useful projects,

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,777
future projects,
and past projects.

16
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:40,246
The Hoover Dam
is a travesty.

17
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:41,848
You also believe
in making furniture.

18
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:43,933
Why don't you go
solder a chair instead?

19
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:45,385
Do you expect me
to make a chair

20
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:47,987
out of transistor chips
and small wires?

21
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,090
Look, the defunding
of the mini-golf course

22
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:52,709
is on the agenda for the city
council meeting tomorrow.

23
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:55,595
I'm sure you'll argue against it
with your trademark vigor.

24
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:57,864
Oh, I will argue,
and I'm gonna win.

25
00:00:57,915 --> 00:00:59,933
That putt-putt
is gonna be around forever,

26
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,401
and when I am done with it,

27
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:04,487
it'll attract more visitors
than the Hoover Dam.

28
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,340
And it'll produce double
the amount of electricity.

29
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,891
- How?
- I'll figure it out.

30
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,527
It already has windmills.
Who cares?

31
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:18,287

32
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,582
Councilmen, I have something
to discuss with you,

33
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:34,267
but before I do,
can I just point out

34
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:36,953
how handsome
the both of you look today?

35
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:39,255
- Yeah, I know.
- I feel very ill.

36
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,074
Okay, well, tomorrow
we are voting on funding

37
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,926
for the mini-golf course,
and personally,

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,244
I think it is great
for families,

39
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,464
it's a great job creator,
and it's extremely cute.

40
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,249
I'm wondering which way
you two are leaning.

41
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,784
Well, the last time
I was there,

42
00:01:50,818 --> 00:01:54,104
I saw kids of all races
getting along and playing.

43
00:01:54,138 --> 00:01:55,955
It was terrible.

44
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,306
So I'm voting
to get rid of it.

45
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:59,325
At least you have
a good reason.

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,177
Well, Howser is with me.

47
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:02,395
Milton is with Dexhart.

48
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,963
Jeremy, you're the swing vote.

49
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:05,482
- What do you think?
- Hmm.

50
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:08,151
Well, on the one hand, I love
cutting government programs.

51
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:11,204
On the other hand,
mini-golf rules.

52
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:14,224
And on the third hand,
I hate both you and Ron Swanson.

53
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:16,176
So this one could go either way.

54
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,944
I'm kind of a badass wild card.

55
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:20,263
Hey, what are you
doing tonight?

56
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:22,315
More like who am I doing?

57
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:25,835
No one.

58
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:26,886
I'm free.
What's up?

59
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:29,522
Can I get two beers
and an ice water

60
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:31,708
for my friend here,
designated driver?

61
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:33,593
I am?
You drove here.

62
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:34,544
Nah, it's too late, bro.

63
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:35,562
I already ordered the water.

64
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,813
I don't know
what you want me to do.

65
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,031
Andy and I just closed
a big donation

66
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:39,532
to the Redwood Music Program,

67
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,350
a charity he discovered,

68
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:43,986
so I suggested we all go out
for a celebratory drink.

69
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:48,157
And somehow I just ended up
becoming the designated driver.

70
00:02:48,175 --> 00:02:50,810
And paying for everyone.

71
00:02:50,845 --> 00:02:53,029
And I didn't
get to choose the bar.

72
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:55,081
I should be more assertive.

73
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:59,652
Aw, the band
is moving me tonight.

74
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,271
It's really good.

75
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,339
Really?
They sound kinda crappy to me.

76
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:04,674
Kinda sounds like
one of your songs, babe.

77
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,576
Well, you know what,
Mouse Rat has a lot of influence

78
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,511
on some
of the local high school bands,

79
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:10,597
mostly 'cause Chang
buys 'em beer and whatnot.

80
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,548
Wait, Andy,
this is a Mouse Rat song.

81
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,485
â™ª Spread your wings
and fly, yeah â™ª

82
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,619
That's my band.

83
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,737
I didn't recognize us
without me

84
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:18,872
because I'm
the only one that matters.

85
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,156
Thank you, everyone.

86
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:21,641
We are Rat Mouse.

87
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,026
Rat Mouse?

88
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,010
Rat bastards.

89
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:24,961
They're playing without me?

90
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:26,713
That's a song I wrote!

91
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:29,932
Hey, baby, can I borrow
your car for a month?

92
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,184
I already lent you my car.

93
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:32,635
Do you not know
where my car is?

94
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,470
Ugh, I'm so sick
of the third degree.

95
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,555
It's like dating a cop.

96
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:37,774
I'm gassy.
Let's make out.

97
00:03:37,808 --> 00:03:38,825
- What?
- Yeah.

98
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:40,527
Move aside!

99
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:42,795
Dating Mona-Lisa
is awesome.

100
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:45,314
Except that I live
in constant fear for my life.

101
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:47,884
So I guess it's time
to do the mature thing

102
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,470
and have someone else
dump her for me.

103
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:53,389
Uh, Perkins, sit down.

104
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,174
I just heard
that you and Traeger

105
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,659
might be
getting back together.

106
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:57,860
Yeah, it's funny, right?

107
00:03:57,895 --> 00:03:59,012
I mean,
we're already planning

108
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:00,129
on having a baby together.

109
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:01,197
We're not quite
a couple but...

110
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:02,248
Yeah. Cool. Congrats.

111
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,550
Listen, I need your help.

112
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:04,918
My girlfriend is crazy.

113
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:07,053
You say that
about every girl you date.

114
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:08,204
You said that about me.

115
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,489
Calm down, Ann.
You're proving my point.

116
00:04:09,523 --> 00:04:12,191
Seriously, Mona-Lisa
is legit insane.

117
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,276
She once jumped
out of a moving car

118
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,928
to buy a Nicki Minaj poster.

119
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,113
Can you break up
with her for me?

120
00:04:17,147 --> 00:04:18,831
I'm not gonna
dump a girl for you.

121
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,750
I'll give you
that chenille blanket of mine

122
00:04:20,784 --> 00:04:22,452
- you love so much.
- Deal.

123
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:23,886
Ugh, but that's
my favorite blankie.

124
00:04:23,904 --> 00:04:25,371
- Won't you do it for free?
- Nope.

125
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,807
Fine.

126
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:30,326
Yeah, dead ringer
for Courtney Thorne-Smith.

127
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,278
She works
at the gas station.

128
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,697
Okay, I need to have Jamm
fall in love with this place,

129
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:35,999
so I'm rolling out
the red carpet.

130
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,550
I need you to stay upbeat.

131
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:38,801
Keep things light.

132
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:39,802
Absolutely.

133
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,454
I can be a sort of...

134
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:43,656
Conversational lubricant.

135
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:44,591
Yeah, there's probably
a less gross way

136
00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:45,642
to say it, but sure.

137
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:46,893
I love being a caddy.

138
00:04:46,927 --> 00:04:50,229
It's so much more
than just carrying clubs.

139
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:52,749
It's about offering
positive reinforcement.

140
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:56,118
I consider myself a caddy
to everyone in my life.

141
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:58,921
- Yeah, good one!
- Nice shot!

142
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,089
Great sweeping.

143
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:03,209
Way to be, duck.

144
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,094
Councilman, nice putter.

145
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:06,562
Oh, thank you very much.

146
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,865
Some fat Hawaiian guy
left it in my waiting room.

147
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,220
When he came back,
I was all like,

148
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,635
"Oh, uh, yeah, yeah,
no, I haven't seen it.

149
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,586
I don't know."

150
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:15,004
Classic.

151
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,357
What a great and funny story.

152
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:19,626
Okay, before we start,
anybody want a hot dog?

153
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:20,860
Hot dogs?

154
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:23,946
You know I have irritable bowel
syndrome, you racist.

155
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,132
Yikes, okay.
How about a snow cone on me?

156
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,266
Hello, Councilman.

157
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,986
Chris, Leslie,
snow cone lady.

158
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,754
I see
you're about to play a round

159
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,856
of publicly
subsidized mini-golf.

160
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,759
Mind if I join you?

161
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,313
Well, hello, Burly, Chang.

162
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:41,497
Hey, man, what's up?

163
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,149
I was just
over at the bar,

164
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,984
enjoying a wonderful night
with my co-workers

165
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,402
who all talked
about how awesome I was,

166
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:47,353
and I look up,
and what do I see?

167
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,705
A band.

168
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,239
But you're missing something
like, uh, I don't know,

169
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:54,160
your lead singer/songwriter/
T-shirt designer/nacho chef.

170
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:55,544
What's up?

171
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:57,447
First of all,
your nachos are terrible.

172
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,865
No one's had
the guts to tell you.

173
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,266
Why don't you melt
the cheese?

174
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,136
We tried to tell you
about the show, man.

175
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,771
I called your cell,
like, 20 times.

176
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:06,456
Well, I dropped
my cell phone

177
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,474
in a bowl of cereal
last week, you idiot.

178
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:10,860
You bothered to call me,
you'd have known that.

179
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:12,111
Maybe you should
change your name

180
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:14,847
to Burly and The Backstabbers.

181
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,432
That's a pretty good name,
actually.

182
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,835
Yeah, he's really good
at coming up with names.

183
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,203
Get me
a Budweiser Black Crown.

184
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:22,538
You guys got
Black Crown here?

185
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,357
If not, you should.

186
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:25,441
Ron, are you gonna
be joining us?

187
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:27,510
I won't be playing.

188
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:29,445
I'm simply here
to remind Councilman Jamm

189
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:31,381
that this ridiculous play palace

190
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:33,916
costs the taxpayers
thousands of dollars a year.

191
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:35,351
And what a bargain.

192
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:38,020
I mean, kids love it,
adults love it, Jamm loves it.

193
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:39,272
Everybody loves it.

194
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:40,556
It's like
the Toy Story 3 of places.

195
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,774
Yeah, she's right, Swanson.

196
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,109
I do love it.

197
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:44,360
You should relax a little.

198
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:45,561
Have a snow cone.

199
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:46,696
Leslie's buying all night.

200
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,780
You don't say.

201
00:06:47,815 --> 00:06:49,365
She's buying you snow cones,

202
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,035
and tomorrow you're voting on
an issue that she cares about.

203
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,620
Hey, guys, what, are we
gonna stand around all day

204
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:57,106
and listen to Ron
spout off unrelated facts

205
00:06:57,124 --> 00:06:59,275
about blah, blah, blah,
or are we gonna play?

206
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,443
Game on.

207
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:01,444
Hey, everybody, great news.

208
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,080
They gave us
free mylar balloons.

209
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:06,299
I got dibs
on the dinosaur.

210
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,384
And the pirate and the dolphin.
I want all of 'em.

211
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,470
- You got 'em.
- Sweet.

212
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,470
The Councilman is away...
Good luck to you both.

213
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,545
Luck has nothing
to do with it, Chris.

214
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:20,863
Yeah, I could be a pro!

215
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:22,581
Wow, you are
on fire, Jeremy.

216
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:24,032
- Having fun?
- Mmhmm.

217
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:26,868
I think this proves
that this is a wonderful place

218
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,104
that brings joy
to people's lives

219
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,889
and brings
a community together.

220
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:32,874
It's also a place
that costs the taxpayer

221
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,827
$9,000 in annual subsidies.

222
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:38,230
You guys sound like school.

223
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:40,799
I have two important pieces
of caddy information.

224
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,968
Councilman Jamm
leads by eight strokes,

225
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:45,036
and you are both
about to set a course record.

226
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,321
For friendship.

227
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:48,640
On to the next hole.

228
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:50,942
You are pandering
to get a vote.

229
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:52,877
And worse,
you're deliberately losing.

230
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:53,945
I am not
deliberately losing.

231
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,814
I'm having
a very off night.

232
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:57,332
Losing on purpose
is a form of lying.

233
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:00,001
You're only as good
as your word.

234
00:08:00,036 --> 00:08:01,052
You want a word, Ron?

235
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,604
I have a word for you.

236
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:04,889
I will do anything
I can to get Jamm's vote

237
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,541
so that he will
keep this course open,

238
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:07,792
and it will be good
for the community...

239
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,894
stop!
I know it's more than one word.

240
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:11,129
Shut up.

241
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:12,547
â™ª Remember...

242
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,382
Hi, Mona-Lisa?

243
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:15,567
Hi.

244
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:16,568
I'm Ann Perkins.

245
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:18,386
- I used to date Tom.
- Oh, okay.

246
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:20,972
We can do this,
but I will bite you.

247
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,225
Is that a screwdrive...
no, I do not want to fight.

248
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,359
- No.
- Okay.

249
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:26,194
I just wanna
talk to you woman-to-woman

250
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:29,014
because I know Tom
pretty well.

251
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:29,965
Do you know his ATM pin?

252
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:31,016
'Cause I cannot crack

253
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,083
that little bitch's code.

254
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:33,618
I don't.

255
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:35,270
You know what
used to drive me nuts?

256
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,138
He is a total control freak.

257
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:39,857
I mean, you have to put
a coaster down on every surface,

258
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,376
and the worst part is,
they're all

259
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,578
made out of pictures
from Diddy's Instagram.

260
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,530
Diddy's on Instagram?

261
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:49,084
How did I not know that Diddy
was on Instagram, you jagweeds?

262
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:51,536
- Who are you yelling at?
- The jagweeds.

263
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,622
Why are you
still in front of me?

264
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:56,691
â™ª Everything that used to...
- I'm done with that band.

265
00:08:56,726 --> 00:08:58,793
I mean, I'm an adult now,
you know?

266
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:01,696
I work two part-time jobs.
Hello.

267
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:02,981
I don't need the stress

268
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:05,050
of playing guitar
with my friends every few weeks.

269
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,802
Yeah, plus look how bad
they are without you.

270
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:09,354
Burly's terrible.

271
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:11,723
He actually has
a really beautiful voice

272
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:12,974
for a backup singer.

273
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:14,742
Right,
that's what I meant.

274
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:17,145
I love Andy,
but to be perfectly honest,

275
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:18,663
Mouse Rat's music
is not my thing.

276
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:21,015
I really only listen to,
like, German Death Reggae

277
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,835
and Halloween sound effects
records from the 1950s.

278
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:25,086
And Bette Midler.

279
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,222
Obviously.

280
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,073
You know what,
I'm retiring from music.

281
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:30,725
- Andy. Andy.
- Done.

282
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:32,010
But not without first

283
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:35,980
a monster farewell
performance solo

284
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:38,316
on this stage tonight,
everybody.

285
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,518
I'ma show these idiots
what a big mistake they made.

286
00:09:40,553 --> 00:09:43,404
I need piece of paper, I need
a pen, I need four more beers,

287
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:46,057
I need a computer fan, I need
a lightning bolt of inspiration.

288
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:47,158
It's song writing time.

289
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,143
What do you need
a computer fan for?

290
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:52,263
Sometimes when you use
a computer, it gets hot,

291
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:55,366
and the fan
cools it down.

292
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,452
You know,
I think it's great

293
00:09:57,486 --> 00:09:59,587
that you're cool
with Tom's financial situation.

294
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:00,638
What are you talking about?

295
00:10:00,689 --> 00:10:03,291
Tommy owns his own business.

296
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:05,176
Yeah, but he had
to borrow a lot of money,

297
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,161
and when you're not around,

298
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:09,897
Tom drinks tap water.

299
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:11,115
What?

300
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,151
Excuse me.

301
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,969
You're broke?

302
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:17,405
Uh, yeah, super broke.
Are you upset about that?

303
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:20,191
Mm, yeah, 'cause I don't
eff with poorsies.

304
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:23,211
But thanks to a warning
from my new best friend,

305
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:24,562
I don't have to, okay?

306
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:26,647
We're done,
you're awesome,

307
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,800
and I don't even usually
like Puerto Rican chicks.

308
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,501
I'm not... I mean,
it shouldn't matter, but I'm...

309
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:32,053
You're breaking up
with me?

310
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:35,073
- Oh, man, that sucks.
- That's right. It's over.

311
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:36,541
Let's go dance.

312
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:37,761
Help.

313
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:42,830
Ugh, I cannot catch
a break.

314
00:10:42,864 --> 00:10:44,682
You better find
your stroke, Knope.

315
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:46,234
Guys, I'm gonna
let Julie go home.

316
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:48,503
It's getting late, and Jeremy's
eaten all the syrup.

317
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:49,704
Thank you.

318
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:50,772
It's been an honor
working alongside you.

319
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:52,490
- Thanks.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up.

320
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,192
Snow cones
are half the fun.

321
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:55,626
Yeah, Julie,
could you stay, please?

322
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:57,511
I have calculus homework.
I...

323
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,564
Oh, well, math is worthless
in real life.

324
00:10:59,598 --> 00:11:01,633
I mean, there's an app
for calculating tips.

325
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,616
That's all you need.

326
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:03,801
Math is very important,

327
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:05,269
especially for young women.
Stay in school.

328
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:08,139
I've made my point.
Leslie has made hers.

329
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,425
Which way are you voting,
Councilman?

330
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:12,020
Uh, well, I'm kind of
still on the fence

331
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,394
about this budget thing,

332
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:16,130
but I do love watching
you guys squabble over me.

333
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,082
You sure make a guy feel
like a real lady.

334
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:19,117
Weird.

335
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:20,701
All right,
how about this?

336
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,286
You two play each other.

337
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,455
Nine holes.
Winner gets my vote.

338
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,607
I'm game. Ron?

339
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,493
An athletic competition
where both parties

340
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:31,162
are competing their hardest
is certainly more honorable

341
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:32,747
than whatever
this charade is.

342
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:34,182
Sudden death playoff

343
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:36,017
on the very course
that hangs in the balance.

344
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:38,236
I could literally faint

345
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,804
if I didn't
have impeccable blood pressure.

346
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:43,107
Oh, hey, everybody.

347
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:45,209
My name is Andy Dwyer.

348
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:47,695
You probably know me
as the artist formerly known

349
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,530
as the lead singer
of Mouse Rat.

350
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:53,184
Well, after tonight, you'll only
know me as the former artist

351
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:56,738
formerly known
as the lead singer of Mouse Rat.

352
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:58,473
I'm retiring from music.

353
00:11:58,507 --> 00:12:01,759
This is my swan song.

354
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,148
â™ª Once I was
a golden swan â™ª

355
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:09,400
â™ª swan of a man

356
00:12:09,451 --> 00:12:11,669
â™ª now that swan's name
was Andy â™ª

357
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,072
â™ª and he started
a rock and roll band â™ª

358
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:16,991
â™ª he made
incredible nachos â™ª

359
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,677
â™ª that everybody claimed
they loved â™ª

360
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:22,814
â™ª and then the band mates
dicked him over â™ª

361
00:12:22,848 --> 00:12:26,100
â™ª with a massive
rock and roll shove â™ª

362
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:28,553
â™ª this is my swan song

363
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:30,088
â™ª watch me fly

364
00:12:31,122 --> 00:12:32,974
- Tom.
- What happened to you?

365
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:34,442
Mona-Lisa happened to me.

366
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,677
She covered me in glitter
and Anna Nicole body spray.

367
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,613
Why do they still
even make that?

368
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:40,331
They don't... she's had
the same bottle for years.

369
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:42,233
She just mixes in
water and baby oil.

370
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,984
Now it's your turn
to help me, okay?

371
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:46,270
You need to break things off
with me and Mona-Lisa.

372
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:48,189
Uh, Ann,
this might be a battle

373
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:49,173
you need to fight yourself.

374
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,291
I try not to get involved

375
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:51,325
in other people's
personal relationships.

376
00:12:51,343 --> 00:12:52,810
Aah! Don't hurt me.

377
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,262
Get me
out of this friendship!

378
00:12:54,296 --> 00:12:56,164
â™ª I'm gonna find a place

379
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:58,049
â™ª where I can be
the beautiful duckling â™ª

380
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:02,153
â™ª I always was inside

381
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:05,173
â™ª whoa

382
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:07,842
â™ª whoa

383
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,428
â™ª whoa

384
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:16,267
Why is there a gorilla
guarding this gingerbread house?

385
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,685
Because mini-golf
is awesome.

386
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,679
It's cute, and it's fun,
and it needs to be saved.

387
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:22,192
Less talk.
More competing for my vote.

388
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:27,127
Wow.

389
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:28,446
This is it.

390
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,930
Ron leads by one.

391
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:31,799
If he hits the ball
into the dragon's mouth,

392
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:32,950
he gets Jamm's vote.

393
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,385
Uh, bean sprouts.

394
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,437
Tofu.
Ralph Nader.

395
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:38,556
Ayn Rand
is a terrible writer.

396
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:41,576
Don't mess up, don't mess up,
don't mess up.

397
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:43,744
- Damn it!
- Hole- in-one!

398
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,029
Excellent win, Ron.

399
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,814
Even better loss, Leslie.

400
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:48,666
Ultimately, we learn
the most about ourselves

401
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,334
through the losses.

402
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:51,335
Swanson, I hate you.

403
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,753
Nothing will change that.

404
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,989
But I respect the hell
out of your short game.

405
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:57,157
You got my vote, hombre.

406
00:13:57,676 --> 00:13:59,794
Hey, you got
a hole-in-one on 18,

407
00:13:59,828 --> 00:14:01,345
so I'm supposed
to give you this.

408
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,498
No, he gets
the dragon too?

409
00:14:04,516 --> 00:14:05,666
A fine trophy.

410
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:07,101
I think I'll keep it
in the office.

411
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:08,335
No, you won't.

412
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:09,520
- Here, kid, want this, huh?
- Yeah.

413
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:11,556
Take it and run.
Run!

414
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:16,196
Tom, she's coming!
Tom!

415
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:17,831
Okay, desperation time.
Follow my lead.

416
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,882
What lead?
What do you mean?

417
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,867
What are you...
oh.

418
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:25,539
What the mother-effing, c-ing
ess-ing, effing k-ing eff

419
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,957
is going on right now?

420
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,075
Sorry, Mona-Lisa.

421
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:29,559
We can't keep our hands
off each other.

422
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:30,927
That is accurate.

423
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:32,946
Oh, it's all
finally very clear.

424
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,848
All the times
that you were like,

425
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:36,183
"Oh, no,
Tom's no good for you."

426
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:38,285
And all the times you tried
to break it off with me...

427
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,020
- I finally get it.
- Mmhmm.

428
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:41,988
You guys want
a threesome.

429
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:44,307
What? No. We do not wanna
have a threesome with you.

430
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:46,259
Well, let's not
rush to judgment.

431
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:48,662
- I mean, I say we hear her out.
- Gross.

432
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:49,729
Tom, good luck.

433
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,181
You still owe me
a blanket.

434
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,501
She's got a screw loose,
am I right?

435
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:55,469
Actually she's not the one

436
00:14:55,503 --> 00:14:56,937
in my life
I would call crazy.

437
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:58,488
Look, I still don't
think we should date.

438
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,623
Oh, me neither.

439
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,624
I've been single
for an hour now,

440
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,976
and it's the tits!

441
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,127
I'd still like
to hook up though.

442
00:15:04,662 --> 00:15:09,166
Yo, do you wanna have
a threesome with us?

443
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,484
Yeah, okay.

444
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:11,718
- Cool.
- Sweet.

445
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:12,769
- All right.
- All right.

446
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:13,838
Yo, what up?
My name is Mona-Lisa.

447
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,407
Well, hello,
fellow employees.

448
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:19,142
Co-workers,
I bid you adieu.

449
00:15:19,177 --> 00:15:21,128
Whoa, fancy Andy.

450
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,245
Oh, me?
No.

451
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:24,014
This is just
how I dress now.

452
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,717
Funny goofball music Andy...

453
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:29,252
is gone.

454
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:31,588
You're left
with the professional remains.

455
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:32,923
I'm an adult now.

456
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:34,341
I'm gonna focus on business,
which is good.

457
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,259
Give me more time
to play video games.

458
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:41,314
Babe, you love that band
that I also love so much.

459
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:43,450
They're important to you.

460
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,169
Come on, call Burly
and ask him to let you back in.

461
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,521
Why, so they
can steal my swan song?

462
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,706
Ha, joke's on them.
I forgot it.

463
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,975
No, business
is my life now.

464
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:54,411
- Okay, what's in there?
- I don't know.

465
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:55,812
I-it's locked.

466
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,931
- Yeah, that's my briefcase.
- Is it?

467
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:00,500
Good gravy.

468
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:01,618
Oh, hello, Ron.

469
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:03,220
I believe
you know this gorilla.

470
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,056
It used to bring joy
to hundreds of Pawnee families,

471
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,991
but then you got rid
of its habitat, so it died.

472
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,744
Your office shall serve
as its monkey tomb.

473
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:12,495
- How much did you pay for this?
- Irrelevant.

474
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,931
I would pay any amount
of money to properly shame you.

475
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:17,184
Leslie, you should know by now
that I live my life

476
00:16:17,218 --> 00:16:19,002
according to a certain set
of principles,

477
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,271
and I do not deviate
from them.

478
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:23,874
Right, I mean, God forbid
you're flexible in any way.

479
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:26,075
You should just stick
to your stupid, rigid,

480
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:27,777
anti-government principles.

481
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,679
But you know what?
Those principles stink.

482
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:31,114
They're not
the right principles.

483
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:32,899
You may think so.
I do not.

484
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,135
Thank you
for my new silver-backed friend.

485
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,003
I like him very much.

486
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:41,458
I will call him "$9,000
of taxpayer money the gorilla."

487
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:44,061
That is a terrible...
his name is Mr. Fuzzyface!

488
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,481
Hey.

489
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:52,302
How did your wild dirtbag
fantasy night work out?

490
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:54,788
Well, Mona-Lisa and the random
girl she grabbed after you left

491
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:57,357
got into a fistfight
in the parking lot.

492
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,992
Eventually, Mona-Lisa
threw a cinderblock

493
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:00,076
through the girl's windshield.

494
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:01,878
She dives in,
steals her purse,

495
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:04,564
doesn't go for the money,
steals all her birth control pills,

496
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,116
and says, "Bitch,
you're gonna get pregnant."

497
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,568
She then pretends
those are ecstasy

498
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,139
and sells it
to a bunch of college kids

499
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,472
that are drinking
GoldschlÃ¤ger at a gas station.

500
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:14,691
You have to break up
with her.

501
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:15,875
I tried. Again.

502
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,177
It did not go well.

503
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:18,762
Did she assault you?

504
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:22,215
- No, this was a sexual injury.
- Okay, gross.

505
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:24,050
Anyway, here's
your chenille blanket.

506
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,035
You earned it.

507
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:25,986
Thanks for your help.

508
00:17:26,037 --> 00:17:27,287
Tom, thank you.

509
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,939
Eh, be nice
to Chenille O'Neal.

510
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:30,106
I will.

511
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:31,107
It needs
to be brushed regularly.

512
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:32,102
Never use a lint roller.

513
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:34,094
- I'm dead serious.
- Okay.

514
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,095
And keep it out
of direct sunlight.

515
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:36,947
If I see this
at one picnic, I swear...

516
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:38,198
Okay, you know what,
I don't even want it anymore.

517
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:39,432
Yes!

518
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:40,934
Thank you!

519
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:43,503
What's up, yellow head?

520
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:45,522
Jamm, are you here
to rub it in my face

521
00:17:45,556 --> 00:17:46,973
that I lost
your vote last night?

522
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:51,661
Well, I was, but it doesn't
have to go down that way.

523
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,813
You shook Ron's hand
and told him

524
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:55,448
that you were gonna vote
to close the putt-putt.

525
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:57,033
My word is garbage.

526
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,084
Everyone knows that.

527
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,386
Let's talk deal.

528
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:03,006
What can you offer me
to change my mind?

529
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,276
Wow, Jamm, even for you,
this is pretty sleazy.

530
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,577
Hey, don't act
so shocked.

531
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:10,113
A few months ago,
you traded me your office

532
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:11,531
for that stupid
swimming pool bill.

533
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:13,616
Last night you bring in
a teenage girl

534
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,319
to pump me
full of snow cones.

535
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:20,173
This is simply
how people like us operate.

536
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,842
I have six things
to say to you.

537
00:18:22,877 --> 00:18:25,829
One: You drive me nuts
with your rigid code of honor.

538
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,248
Two: Congratulations,
putt-putt has been defunded.

539
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:30,667
And only because Jamm
was going to double-cross you,

540
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:32,402
and I made him
stick to his word.

541
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,205
Three: I am furious that
putt-putt has been defunded.

542
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,539
Four: I am sorry
that I said

543
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,907
the gorilla's blood
was on your hands.

544
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,292
'Twas Leslie killed
the beast.

545
00:18:39,343 --> 00:18:42,045
Five: Putt-putt is for children,
and they are the future,

546
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,763
and I have already written
a ballot measure

547
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,515
that will save it,
and it will pass.

548
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,935
And six: Your rigid code
of honor, which drives me nuts,

549
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:50,520
makes you
a wonderful human being,

550
00:18:50,554 --> 00:18:51,521
and I am proud
to call you my friend,

551
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:53,089
and don't ever change.

552
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:55,525
- You want a drink?
- Very much.

553
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,204
Burly,
I just want to say I'm sorry

554
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,506
that I haven't been to rehearsal

555
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:04,675
and that I won't
let you sing or write songs

556
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:06,393
or walk out onstage
in front of me.

557
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,228
Man, I love playing
with you guys.

558
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:10,481
And I want back in
if you'll let me.

559
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:11,865
Well, we never
wanted to kick you out.

560
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,367
It's just, you didn't
show up for practice,

561
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:14,651
- and we like to play.
- Right.

562
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:17,454
If you wanna come back in,
you can.

563
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,739
I'm more
of a backup singer anyways.

564
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:19,773
You can say that again.

565
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:20,741
No, no, no.

566
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:22,042
Hey, you got a great voice.

567
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:23,043
Yeah, Ben!

568
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:24,611
God, don't say that.

569
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,279
- Welcome back, buddy.
- Yes.

570
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:28,382
All right!

571
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,083
Hey, I'll even try melting
the cheese on the nachos.

572
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:31,084
All right.

573
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:32,252
It won't work.

574
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:34,588
You're gonna look
like such an idiot.

575
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:37,207
I have been in the city
council for almost a year,

576
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,465
and I'm proud
of what I've done.

577
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:40,560
But every once in a while,
I end up in a situation

578
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:42,045
that makes my stomach queasy.

579
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:44,347
You're in politics.
What did you expect?

580
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,516
Frankly, I hoped it would
be like dealing with you.

581
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,937
People with strong opinions
hashing it out respectfully.

582
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:53,156
And then you either
realize that I'm right

583
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:56,026
or you get hungry
and go home and I win.

584
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,477
There are
a lot of Jeremy Jamms

585
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:59,279
along the path
you're walking.

586
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,164
I suppose you just
need to figure out

587
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,417
whether it's a path
you truly wanna walk.

588
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:06,586
Yeah.

589
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:08,171
I'm taking
that gorilla with me

590
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:09,256
and putting it back
in the putt-putt

591
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,842
- when it reopens.
- Sorry, no.

592
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:13,427
That gorilla was a gift

593
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,379
from a very determined co-worker
whom I respect.

594
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,548
And there's
a certain code of honor

595
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,916
that accompanies gift-giving.

596
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:22,602
God, you're the worst.

597
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:25,655
Ladies and gentlemen,

598
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:28,141
welcome to Mouse Rat's
Reunion Show,

599
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,994
featuring me, Andy Dwyer,
and for the first time,

600
00:20:31,028 --> 00:20:34,247
Andrew "Burly" Burlinson
on lead vocals.

601
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:36,383
That's right,
two lead vocalists.

602
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,718
Name one other band
that's done that.

603
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:41,154
The Beatles.

604
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:42,839
Three, four!

605
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:50,263
â™ª Oh I know
we had bad times â™ª

606
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:54,267
â™ª but we had good times too

607
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:58,267
