1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,704
Ted! Ted! Ted! Ted! Ted! Ted!

2
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:11,773
Article Two, Section Two
of the Pawnee Charter reads,

3
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:14,793
"Be it decreed:
Should the taxation of tea

4
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:16,628
"rise to an unacceptable level,

5
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:19,982
citizens shall dump Ted
into Ramsett Lake."

6
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:23,268
Does anyone object?

7
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:25,070
As always, I object.

8
00:00:25,104 --> 00:00:26,855
Nay, enough dithering!

9
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:28,440
Dump the miscreant!
Boo!

10
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:33,812
Today is Ted Party Day,
where we commemorate

11
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:36,181
the great Pawnee tea dump
of 1817.

12
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:37,583
Historical fun fact...

13
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:39,635
when the Founding Fathers wrote
the charter,

14
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:41,236
their old-timey script made

15
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:43,005
one of the "a's
look like a "d,"

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,573
so "tea" became "Ted."

17
00:00:44,607 --> 00:00:45,941
It's just one
of those little things

18
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:48,727
that reminds us of Pawnee's
rich and vibrant past.

19
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:50,362
Plus, we get to go find
a guy named Ted

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,763
and throw him
in a lake.

21
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:53,315
One!

22
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:54,633
I don't even go by Ted!

23
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:56,485
- Two!
- I go by Theodore!

24
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:58,436
- Three!
- Aah!

26
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:23,412
Hey, Ted.
Great job today.

27
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:24,680
You were so funny

28
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:25,681
when you were like,
"My cell phone,

29
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:27,099
I left it in my pocket."

30
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:29,234
Then you checked it, remember,
and it didn't work.

31
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:30,235
Yeah, that was hilarious.

32
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:31,753
Listen,
I am just here to say

33
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:33,488
that I am done
with Ted Party Day.

34
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:36,108
- Ha! Classic Ted.
- I'm serious.

35
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:37,592
I'm not getting dumped
in that lake anymore.

36
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:38,944
And I talked
to the other Teds in town,

37
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:40,362
and they're not doing it
either.

38
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:41,797
Come on, Ted Party Day
is protected

39
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,265
by Article Two
in the town charter.

40
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,684
And we have the right,
nay, the obligation,

41
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:47,436
to dump Ted into the lake
every year.

42
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:48,770
That's the way
it's always been done.

43
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:49,955
Okay, first of all,

44
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:51,156
"That's the way
it's always been done"

45
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:52,774
is not a good reason
to keep doing something.

46
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:55,860
Second, it was a misprint.
They clearly meant "tea."

47
00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:57,129
I just think you need
to be careful

48
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:59,497
about speculating
what the Founders meant

49
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,450
when they were writing
the town charter.

50
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:02,668
Okay, fine.

51
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:03,535
You want to enforce
every single old law

52
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:04,720
we have on our books?

53
00:02:04,754 --> 00:02:05,888
Hey, can I see your keys
for a second?

54
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,306
Here's a quarter.

55
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,825
I own your car now.

56
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,576
- Wha...
- Sorry.

57
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:14,146
The Pawnee Charter clearly
states that any white citizen

58
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,198
has the right to seize
any Indian property

59
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,666
for 25 cents.

60
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:19,818
That is an outdated
and racist law.

61
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:21,987
And obviously they meant
"American Indian."

62
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,488
Whoa, I think
we should be careful

63
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,140
when we speculate
what the Founders intended

64
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:26,441
when they wrote the charter.

65
00:02:26,476 --> 00:02:28,410
Okay, Ted.
I know what you're doing.

66
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:29,895
You're quoting me back to me.

67
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,380
But I'm gonna quote me
back to you and say

68
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,265
that Ted Party Day
will never change.

69
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:34,399
Uhoh.

70
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,085
You, a woman,
just raised your voice

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,369
to a landowning male.

72
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:41,056
According to a Pawnee statute
passed in 1868,

73
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,760
I get to do this.

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,514
I was not aware
of that statute.

75
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,367
Ron, you have to help me.

76
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:53,752
Chris is making me do

77
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:55,654
some stupid management
training leadership course.

78
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:57,489
Now that you run
the Animal Control department,

79
00:02:57,523 --> 00:02:58,857
you have qualified

80
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:00,811
for the Chris Traeger
Management Training Seminar

81
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:02,427
or "Ka-tumts."

82
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,780
It's not a great acronym,
but it is a great seminar.

83
00:03:04,814 --> 00:03:06,381
Can you get me out of it?

84
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,866
Yes.

85
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:09,551
Normally, if given a choice

86
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:11,269
between doing something
and nothing,

87
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:12,671
I'd choose to do nothing.

88
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:13,772
But I will do something

89
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,390
if it helps someone else
do nothing.

90
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:16,508
I'd work all night

91
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:18,510
if it meant nothing got done.

92
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,228
Ron Swanson
and April Ludgate,

93
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,714
literally my two favorite people
in the catalogued universe.

94
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:24,816
April will not be
participating

95
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,318
in your pointless course

96
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:28,186
because she has
more important things to do

97
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:31,990
like not participating
in your pointless course.

98
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:33,942
I just want April
to become as great

99
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:35,527
a department head
as yourself.

100
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:37,329
Which is why
this is pointless.

101
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:39,898
I've been head of the Parks
department for 12 years,

102
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:42,601
and I never had any
"management training" course.

103
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:45,370
Ron, you've never been
"ka-tumtsed?"

104
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:46,704
I am legally required

105
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:48,840
to ka-tumts
every department head.

106
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,809
Otherwise, we are open
to all kinds of liability.

107
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,377
What are you saying?

108
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:53,678
I'm saying that tomorrow
during the seminar,

109
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,213
April is going to have
a classmate.

110
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:56,598
And spoiler alert...

111
00:03:56,632 --> 00:03:58,366
- it's Alf.
- It's you.

112
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,169
This went poorly.

113
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,589
What, no.
Damn it!

114
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:06,224
What are you bidding on?

115
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:07,526
It better not be
Terrence Howard's tank top

116
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,527
from Hustle & Flow.

117
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,295
- It is not.
- Good.

118
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:11,529
'Cause I am bidding on it

119
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:12,881
and I am ready to spend
an amount

120
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:14,716
that my accountant calls
"Dangerous and irresponsible."

121
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:17,369
JJ's diner put an old
waffle iron up for auction.

122
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,704
It's the perfect breakfast
day gift for Leslie.

123
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:20,889
"Breakfast day"?

124
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:22,924
Leslie has anniversaries
for everything.

125
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:25,243
"Zoo day," first time we went
to the zoo together.

126
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:26,628
"Double date day,"

127
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:27,629
it was the first time
we went on a double date.

128
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:28,913
"Daniel Day-Lewis day.

129
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,048
"Talk-like-a-pirate day.

130
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:31,566
Talk-like-a-Pittsburgh-pirate
day,"

131
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,368
which why and how?

132
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:36,338
This calendar was last year's
calendar day present

133
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:37,606
celebrating the first time

134
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,975
she ever bought me
a calendar.

135
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:43,195
You have to buy a present
for every one of these?

136
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,413
She always tells me not to,
but then she buys me something

137
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,432
that's awesome and thoughtful,
and then I feel terrible.

138
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,426
But that's the thing.
This is the perfect present.

139
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:51,253
I just keep getting outbid
by someone named

140
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:52,988
"Tall Tie-ree-on Lannister."

141
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:54,890
What kind of name is
Tie-ree-on anyway?

142
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:57,776
You're kidding, right?
Tyrion Lannister?

143
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,161
Lord of Casterly Rock?
The Half-Man?

144
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:01,930
You don't watch
Game of Thrones?

145
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:03,899
- No. You do?
- Hell yeah.

146
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:05,934
Have you seen
those Dothraki dudes?

147
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:07,485
They can get it.

148
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,323
Everybody on that show
can get it.

149
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:13,475
I think I know
who I'm bidding against.

150
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:16,311
I now realize
that I was wrong,

151
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:18,363
and it's time
that we purged the books

152
00:05:18,397 --> 00:05:22,083
of many of our town's
outdated and obscure laws.

153
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:23,334
The bill that I have written

154
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:25,020
with the full support
of the city council

155
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:28,123
will repeal 110 obsolete laws

156
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:30,842
such as all menstruating women
shall be confined

157
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:31,927
to their bathtubs

158
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:35,413
and Article Two,
aka, Ted Party Day.

159
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,649
The floor is now open
for public comments.

160
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:38,884
Oh, here we go.

161
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:40,418
Thank you.
My name is Garth Blundin,

162
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:42,771
and I object
to your ridiculous proposal.

163
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:46,524
The Pawnee Charter
shall not be changed.

164
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:47,993
Not today, not ever!

165
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:49,578
Wow, a lot of passion,
Mr. Blundin.

166
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:50,962
Thank you so much.

167
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:52,547
Your objection is noted
and officially in the record.

168
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:55,200
- Shall we proceed to a vote?
- No. No, we shall not.

169
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:57,535
Article Seven,
Section Three allows

170
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,204
for a "Citizen filibuster."

171
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:02,874
If I stand here
and refuse to yield my time,

172
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:05,360
you are prohibited
from voting on the bill.

173
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:08,113
That section defines
"Buffalo meat"

174
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:09,497
as acceptable currency.

175
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,882
- Is that the Buffalo meat one?
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:14,953
I meant Article Three,
Section Seven.

177
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:18,440
Let the filibustering begin.

178
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,041
I would now like to share

179
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:23,695
some ideas I have for
J.J. Abrams' seventh chapter

180
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:25,430
in the Star Wars' saga.

181
00:06:25,464 --> 00:06:28,466
Pan down from
the twin suns of Tatooine.

182
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:31,469
We are now close on the mouth
of the Sarlacc Pit.

183
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:32,821
After a beat,

184
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:36,691
the gloved Mandalorian
armor gauntlet of Boba Fett

185
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:39,644
grabs onto the sand outside
of the Sarlacc Pit

186
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:42,664
and the feared bounty hunter
pulls himself

187
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:45,583
from the maw
of the sand beast.

188
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,752
Ugh, he's right.
He can do this.

189
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:50,088
This is exactly why we need
to modernize these laws.

190
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,258
This kind of thing made sense
when we had council in a barn

191
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,826
and there were
80 people in the town,

192
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,012
but now this is nuts.

193
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:58,430
If he holds
the reality gem,

194
00:06:58,464 --> 00:07:01,716
that means he can jump
from different realities.

195
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,435
This will be our link

196
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:05,553
to the Marvel Universe
from the Star Wars Universe.

197
00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:09,853
Imagine those who
were up against Chewbacca

198
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:12,930
'cause that's gonna happen.
After a beat, Luke says,

199
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,115
"Darth Vader was my father,
but Ben Kenobi was my master."

200
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:17,450
And he cuts Hannibal Lecter
in half.

201
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:18,601
Mr. Blundin,

202
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:20,570
look, the laws
I'm trying to get rid of

203
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:22,455
have no more relevance
in modern society

204
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,040
and they're embarrassing
to Pawnee.

205
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:27,077
Repealing them would show that
we're changing with the times.

206
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,696
You can't just change
the charter willy-nilly.

207
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,698
You start by casually repealing
a couple of "old laws,"

208
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:35,185
the next thing you know,
your jack-booted storm troopers

209
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:37,654
are kicking in my door
and arresting my wife

210
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:39,172
for no reason
if I were married.

211
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:40,406
By "jack-booted
storm troopers,"

212
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:41,975
do you mean
the Pawnee Police Department?

213
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,310
- Hey, Clyde.
- Hi, Leslie.

214
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:45,762
Good Danish today.

215
00:07:45,796 --> 00:07:48,965
The Pawnee charter is not
a "living document," Ms. Knope.

216
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:51,101
You have no respect
for the traditions of this town.

217
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:52,652
I absolutely do.

218
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:55,205
I used to give tours
at the Pawnee Historical House.

219
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:57,090
Three times,
"Employee Of The Fortnight."

220
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:59,743
Oh, big deal, you put
on a costume for a couple hours.

221
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:02,395
By that logic, every time
I go to bed at night,

222
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:03,880
I am Wolverine.

223
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:05,548
You bought
X-Men pajamas?

224
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,817
I won them, madam,
in a raffle.

225
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,569
The point is is that
our Founding Fathers

226
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,164
were brilliant
and they were courageous,

227
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:12,722
but they also had
wooden teeth

228
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:14,174
and pooped in holes
in the ground.

229
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,176
It was a more primitive time.

230
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,877
It was a better time.

231
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:20,797
You wouldn't have survived
two weeks in their day.

232
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,949
Oh, really?
How about a little wager?

233
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,384
How about you and I go live
in that historical house,

234
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:28,621
no modern technology,
1817 rules.

235
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,457
If you last longer,
I withdraw my bill.

236
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:32,642
I win,
you stop this nonsense.

237
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:36,329
You have yourself a deal.

238
00:08:36,363 --> 00:08:37,530
Please write down

239
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:39,516
what you hope to gain
from the seminar,

240
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,817
seal it in the envelope,

241
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:42,235
and then we'll open it
when it's over.

242
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:44,120
When is this over?

243
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,155
As soon as you learn
to embrace

244
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,657
the power
of positive motivation.

245
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,425
It's a nine-hour seminar
over two days.

246
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,077
- Whoa!
- Oh, good.

247
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:52,178
All right, let's begin.

248
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:54,531
Hop on board
"The Management Train."

249
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,916
First stop...
Motivation Station.

250
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,385
All aboard!

251
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:02,889
Stop bidding on
my waffle iron.

252
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:04,474
You're FutureMrsTigerWoods?

253
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:05,842
I made that profile,
like, ten years ago.

254
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:07,036
I don't know how
to change it.

255
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:09,012
The point is I'm getting
that waffle iron

256
00:09:09,063 --> 00:09:10,864
for Leslie
for breakfast day.

257
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:11,948
Uh, no, you're not.

258
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,583
I'm getting it for her
for waffle day.

259
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:15,135
Wait, you have
a breakfast day too?

260
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,969
- Mine's in June.
- Please, Ben.

261
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:18,688
This is the celebration
of the anniversary

262
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:20,023
of the first time
we hung out at JJ's,

263
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:22,192
which she considers
the beginning of our friendship.

264
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:24,043
Well, imagine
being married to her.

265
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:26,679
It's like being smothered
with a hand-quilted pillow

266
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:28,398
filled
with cherished memories.

267
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:29,732
I can't believe
I'm complaining about

268
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,167
how thoughtful my wife is.

269
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:32,952
Sorry, honey.
I love you.

270
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:34,120
Look, I have known her
for longer,

271
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:36,005
I have five years' worth
of anniversaries,

272
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,190
so I have seniority.

273
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:38,257
Oh, God. Oh, no.

274
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:39,742
- We've lost the auction.
- What-no.

275
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:41,297
Somebody swooped in
at the last second,

276
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:44,047
- and now we're both screwed.
- No.

277
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:46,633
Okay, Tyrion Lannister,
why don't you just cast a spell

278
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,817
and get us
the waffle iron back?

279
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,219
Oh, okay.

280
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:50,620
I don't even have time to tell
you how wrong you are.

281
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:52,388
Actually, it's gonna bug me
if I don't.

282
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:54,140
The Lannisters,
while very wealthy,

283
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:56,175
do not possess
the magical abilities

284
00:09:56,193 --> 00:09:58,111
of, say, the warlocks
of Qarth for example.

285
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:01,865
This is why
we don't hang out.

286
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,733
Think of yourselves
as engineers

287
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:05,735
steering
a locomotive of positivity

288
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:07,170
that runs on team power.

289
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:09,923
First of all, you don't
"steer" a locomotive.

290
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:10,940
The tracks do.

291
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,026
Second,
there are only three ways

292
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,795
to motivate people...
money, fear, and hunger.

293
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:16,996
Oh, I disagree.

294
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,566
What about encouragement,
appreciation,

295
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,618
and smiles.

296
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:23,069
When people feel supported,

297
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,787
they will literally explode
with productivity.

298
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:26,823
Can you guys just figure out
which way is better

299
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:28,274
and tell me so we can leave?

300
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,475
Thank you
for your input, April,

301
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:30,944
but the ka-tumts requires
that we follow

302
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,128
a very specific syllabus.

303
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,630
You're not being
very inclusive, Chris.

304
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,632
I feel like my input isn't
being appreciated.

305
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,283
You've killed my spirit.

306
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,852
My spirit blood is
on your hands.

307
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:42,689
My God, I've taught you
so much already.

308
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:44,857
Ron, I propose a challenge

309
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,559
to see whose
motivational methods

310
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:47,727
are more effective.

311
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:49,629
Challenge accepted.

312
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,631
I don't want to seem
overdramatic,

313
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:54,684
but this is literally
a battle for April's soul.

314
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:56,786
I don't want to seem
overdramatic,

315
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,472
but I don't really care
what happens here.

316
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:01,674
Oh, God.

317
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,342
I hate this place.

318
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,695
Everything is old.
Old things are dumb.

319
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,647
It's like, just be new.

320
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,115
I don't know, Tom.

321
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,017
I think there's some pretty
cool things from back then.

322
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:12,068
That is a dope bonnet.

323
00:11:12,102 --> 00:11:14,187
Oh, just getting here,
I see.

324
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:15,855
Yikes.
Did you sleep here last night?

325
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,324
Indeed. I want to be here
when the cock crows

326
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:19,459
to get the chores done.

327
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:20,960
Already, I've done
the preserves

328
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:23,863
and chased off
an interloping cable installer.

329
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:27,166
Okay, well, let's put
all modern devices in this pail.

330
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:30,753
Nothing can be used
that was invented past 1817.

331
00:11:30,804 --> 00:11:32,639
Andy, Tom,
you will be our referees.

332
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:33,673
Thank you for volunteering.

333
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:34,774
Definitely didn't volunteer.

334
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:35,858
I had much better things
to do.

335
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:37,110
Leslie said she'd pay me
100 bucks.

336
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,344
And I had nothing better
to do.

337
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:39,445
I'm doing it for free.

338
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,331
There's no way
I'm losing this contest.

339
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:42,832
Old-timey dress? Check.

340
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:44,617
Extensive knowledge
about early prairie life?

341
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:45,618
Right here.

342
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:46,703
Rickets? Cured.

343
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:47,854
Don't need to worry
about rickets.

344
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:50,723
Antiperspirant?
Not allowed.

345
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:53,393
Might get a little rough
in there.

346
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,979
I was wondering
if you could help me out.

347
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:57,480
Say no more.

348
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:59,265
Here's a bunch of guns.

349
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:00,283
Nope.

350
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:01,617
Different thing.

351
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:02,935
I saw that you recently won

352
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:05,038
an auction for
the JJ's diner waffle iron.

353
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,239
And I'd like to...
that's it right there.

354
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:09,025
- I'd like to buy it.
- You and everyone else.

355
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:10,977
Hello, Ben.

356
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:13,997
Seems like I love Leslie
more than you do.

357
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:15,915
- Get in line.
- Yeah.

358
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:17,133
Get in line, pal.

359
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,584
- Who are you?
- I'm Roz.

360
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:20,803
I'm Leslie's mailwoman,
and I need to get her

361
00:12:20,854 --> 00:12:23,272
a Mail Day present
by next Wednesday.

362
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:24,857
It's the anniversary
of the first...

363
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,010
Time you delivered
her mail. Yeah, we get it.

364
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:28,494
Looks like
we've got ourselves

365
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:31,130
an old-fashioned pawnshop
waffle iron bidding war.

366
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:34,150
Let's start the bidding
at $650,000.

367
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:36,452
Okay, I'll counter
with 100 bucks.

368
00:12:36,487 --> 00:12:37,570
200.

369
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:38,738
I'll let you take anything

370
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,073
- out of this bag.
- I'll tell you what, Ann.

371
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,228
I'll give it to you
if you go

372
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:42,842
- on a date with me.
- Oh, God.

373
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:45,011
I can't believe
I'm about to do this, but fine.

374
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,697
One date. But let me make
one thing perfectly clear...

375
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:49,415
- 500 bucks.
- Sold.

376
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,250
- What?
- You still want to go out?

377
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:55,004
I just come into some money.
$500 buys a lot of nitrous.

378
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:57,140
Yeah, nothing warms
the blood

379
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,809
like an old whirly-bout
with the old butter-gyre,

380
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,310
- eh, Leslie?
- Indeed.

381
00:13:01,345 --> 00:13:03,763
Man, this guy's tougher
than I thought.

382
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,565
I don't know how either
of you guys are doing this.

383
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,283
One time my refrigerator
stopped working,

384
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,901
I didn't know what to do.
I just moved.

385
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,653
I just don't think
he's ever gonna quit.

386
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:12,071
He has that look
in his eye

387
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,208
that Ben gets
when he plays Risk.

388
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:19,011
Oh, wow.
That is really good.

389
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:20,246
- Andy.
- No, I'm sorry.

390
00:13:20,264 --> 00:13:21,464
This tastes great.

391
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:23,349
All my favorite foods
have butter on 'em.

392
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:26,636
Pancakes, toast,
popcorn, grapes.

393
00:13:27,888 --> 00:13:30,189
Butter is my favorite food.

394
00:13:30,224 --> 00:13:31,424
Well, then you're gonna love
what I'm churning up.

395
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:32,475
Take a look at...

396
00:13:32,526 --> 00:13:33,860
Oh, my God.
This is horrifying.

397
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:35,611
Nobody eat that.

398
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,063
I think I'm in over my head.

399
00:13:37,097 --> 00:13:38,931
Garth really knows his stuff.

400
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:41,150
He planted
an entire field of barley.

401
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,436
How long is
he planning on staying here?

402
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:47,440
Hey, um, aren't we husband
and wife in this scenario?

403
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,275
- I mean, like, shouldn't you...
- Not a chance.

404
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,277
Okay.

405
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:56,217
Wait, what's that?

406
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,820
Do you guys feel that?

407
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,889
Aah!

408
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,391
How long was that under there?

409
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,942
Man, Garth is a machine.

410
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,961
He brought his own whale
blubber to light the lamps.

411
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:07,896
I thought he was gonna last
an hour max.

412
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,315
It's like he's getting stronger
the longer he stays here.

413
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,869
Whee!
Look at my hoop, Leslie.

414
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:15,354
Look at my hoop!

415
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,638
Ugh! Who could live like this?

416
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,041
No one.
That's why we've moved on.

417
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,242
It's fun to be here on,

418
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,944
like, a school field trip
or something.

419
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:23,979
- It's so, so, so fun.
- So, so fun.

420
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,181
But to live like this
is insane.

421
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:28,233
He must have cheated somehow.

422
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,018
I mean, there's no way a man
who's into X-Men that much

423
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,887
can stay away
from the Internet that long.

424
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,255
We should check his phone.

425
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,474
♪ Goodness, how delicious

426
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,609
♪ eating goober peas

427
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,578
Jerry Gergich.

428
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,563
I need you to stop whatever
it is you're doing

429
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,199
and file as many of these
as you can.

430
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:48,287
Wow, Duraflex cut-top A350s
in deep maroon?

431
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,439
The honor is all mine.

432
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,541
Well, I knew you were
the man for the job.

433
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,910
You are smart and capable.

434
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,646
And I believe
you can accomplish anything.

435
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,198
Thank you so much.

436
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:01,383
You got it, champ.
Get filing.

437
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,718
Aye, aye, Captain.

438
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,305
That is
one motivated worker bee.

439
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:07,873
You guys doing experiments
on Jerry?

440
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:08,957
Yes.

441
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,926
Cool.

442
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,365
Got it.

443
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,866
Okay, now let's not
read anything.

444
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,184
That's an invasion
of his privacy.

445
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,835
Let's just look
at his browser history

446
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,422
and his inbox and his outbox
and his Facebook page.

447
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,623
Yeah, he doesn't
have any new emails.

448
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,174
Oh, my God. It's true.

449
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,643
He hasn't gotten an email in...

450
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,778
12 days!

451
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:30,829
Is he a ghost?

452
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,614
The only ones
he gets are spam.

453
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,633
And he responds to them.

454
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,724
I think I'm gonna be sick.

455
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:37,853
Oh, man.
This guy has no friends.

456
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:40,172
I don't know. Seems like
he's friends with that mule.

457
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,810
What's that?

458
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,528
Well,
since I can't give her

459
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:48,029
a waffle iron
for breakfast day,

460
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,948
I am making her
a miniature Leslie

461
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,650
- out of breakfast food.
- Good lord.

462
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:52,985
Well, listen,
I've been thinking.

463
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,186
How would you feel
about going in

464
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,421
- on the waffle iron together?
- Seriously?

465
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:57,589
That would be great,

466
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,658
but whose holiday
are we celebrating?

467
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,043
Well, I think
I may have a plan

468
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:03,411
that'll get us out of
breakfast day and waffle day

469
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,046
and all the other days
without making us

470
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,115
seem like ungrateful people
who are annoyed

471
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,667
at how amazing Leslie is.

472
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,103
Dude, whatever it is,
I'm in.

473
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,138
- Okay, great.
- What should I do with this?

474
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,140
Just burn it
and bury the ashes

475
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,976
and pray
it doesn't haunt you.

476
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,062
Jerry,

477
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:22,514
stop filing
those red folders at once.

478
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,333
Begin filing
these blue ones.

479
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,418
Oh. Sorry, Ron.
I promised Chris that...

480
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,086
This is the top priority.

481
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,755
I need these blue folders
done now.

482
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,824
You can eat
when you have finished.

483
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,109
File!

484
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:36,628
Oh, my goodness.

485
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,499
Money, fear, hunger.

486
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,536
Hey, there, Garth.
Whatcha whittling?

487
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,520
A birthing stick.

488
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:46,705
What's that?

489
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,874
- You do not want to know.
- Oh, my God.

490
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,075
You look beautiful.

491
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,910
I mean, you changed clothes.

492
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,679
Violation.
I-I challenge

493
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,497
- you are bonnetless!
- Yes, you're right.

494
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,349
I admit, I can't take it
anymore. You win.

495
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,402
Huzzah!
The day is mine.

496
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,272
- I'm gonna miss saying "huzzah."
- Yeah.

497
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:06,341
Garth,
I have another proposition.

498
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,110
Yes, I will go out
on a date with you,

499
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:10,195
but I realize
you're a modern woman,

500
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,430
so I will let you pay.

501
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:12,831
No.

502
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,499
I was wondering
would you like to join

503
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,134
the Pawnee Historical Commission?

504
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,437
Those clowns?
No thank you.

505
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:20,605
They haven't answered
a single one of my complaints

506
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,608
about their anachronistic use
of fonts in their newsletter.

507
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,676
Well, I'm a member,

508
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,111
and I think
we could really use you.

509
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,614
But the only problem is
there's tons of meetings,

510
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,351
lots of work with people
who also love history,

511
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,138
and many social occasions that
you're gonna have to attend,

512
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,773
like cocktail parties
and such.

513
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,324
I can understand
if it's something

514
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,375
you don't want
to commit to.

515
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,177
Just sounds like such
a big bite

516
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,428
out of my soap-making time.

517
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,231
My cousin's arraignment
is in May.

518
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,399
But that's a day.

519
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,984
I just fly out,
I come back the same day.

520
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,318
On a trial basis, yes.

521
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:51,670
Yes, yes.

522
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,289
Great.
Welcome to the team.

523
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,374
Garth dropped his protest,

524
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:56,625
and we were able
to get rid of

525
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,510
all the outdated laws
in the town charter.

526
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,629
I mean, the charter is
a wonderful document,

527
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,797
but we've had the benefit
of almost 200 years

528
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,599
of learning and advancing.

529
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,401
Seems to me
we ought to use it.

530
00:18:06,436 --> 00:18:08,904
I did not change
Article Two, though.

531
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,155
I just couldn't vote

532
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,656
against a good, old-fashioned
lake dunking.

533
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,641
Though Garth and I did come up
with a compromise

534
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,577
that I think will make
everybody happy.

535
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:16,828
From this year hence,

536
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:19,114
a volunteer will represent Ted

537
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:22,334
in our town's most historic
and cherished tradition.

538
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:25,387
This year, the honor
goes to Mr. Garth Blundin!

539
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,626
Huzzah, I'm Ted! I'm Ted!

540
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,011
I'm Ted too, guys.

541
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:34,312
- Andy!
- Yeah!

542
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,815
He's naked, everybody!
Put that away!

543
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,768
- We're all Ted! Yeah!
- No, Andy!

544
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,655
Whoo!

545
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,657
Thank God.
I don't know how to swim.

546
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:48,795
Okay, final tally.

547
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:53,029
- Jerry filed 268 red files.
- Yes!

548
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:55,865
And 384 blue files.

549
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:57,167
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.

550
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,234
How is that possible?

551
00:18:58,252 --> 00:18:59,336
Well, he was so happy

552
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,520
when you told him
he was doing a great job

553
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:01,621
that he spent 20 minutes
on the phone

554
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:02,789
telling Gayle about it.

555
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:05,625
- And the prosecution rests.
- Not so fast.

556
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,060
He may have filed
more blue ones,

557
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:08,378
but they're almost
all filed wrong.

558
00:19:08,412 --> 00:19:10,714
Not surprising
since he was a mess

559
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:11,965
after you talked to him.

560
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,184
Another fascinating edition
of "ka-tumts."

561
00:19:14,218 --> 00:19:16,753
We may never know conclusively
which way works better.

562
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:18,254
But I do know this...

563
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,856
When we first started
the seminar,

564
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,693
I hoped to be able to engage you
in the process.

565
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:25,612
And by that measure
I succeeded.

566
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:27,447
And I predicted that
I would learn nothing

567
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:30,033
from this process.

568
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,235
Mission accomplished.

569
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,603
What did April write?

570
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:35,705
Where is April?

571
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:40,710
"I will pit Ron and Chris
against each other.

572
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,545
They'll argue about dumb stuff

573
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,247
that doesn't matter,
and I will bail.

574
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,216
Then I'll steal $20
from Chris's wallet

575
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,950
and buy pizza with Andy.

576
00:19:47,968 --> 00:19:51,421
Oh, and I'll also steal
Ron's watch, just for fun.

577
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,624
I think April will be
a fine manager.

578
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:56,226
I agree.

579
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,894
It's my favorite kind
of battle...

580
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:01,731
Two men enter,
one me leaves.

581
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:04,651
- Happy waffle day.
- Happy breakfast day.

582
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:06,269
Oh, my God!

583
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:08,471
You guys,
this is the best

584
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:09,989
Breakfast Day/Waffle Day
joint present

585
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:11,858
I have ever received.

586
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,943
Wow.
Thank you so much.

587
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:15,028
You're welcome.

588
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,197
But Ann and I wanted
to tell you

589
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:20,200
that this is the last
Breakfast Day and Waffle Day

590
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,251
we'll be celebrating.

591
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:22,585
Wait, what?

592
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,454
Oh, my God.
You're both dying.

593
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:27,707
No, no. We just can't keep up
with all the anniversaries.

594
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:30,159
It's too much, especially 'cause
you're so good at them.

595
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:31,628
I'm no better at them
than you are.

596
00:20:31,662 --> 00:20:33,797
That's ridiculous, I'm so
much better. Point taken.

597
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:35,531
But we have a compromise.

598
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:38,251
Every year, there will be
one day, "Ann Day,"

599
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,062
where you can celebrate
all of Ann's holidays

600
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:43,256
and "Ben Day" where we can
celebrate all of ours.

601
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:45,558
What about
Ann Month and Ben Month?

602
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:47,393
How about a week?

603
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:49,479
Fine.

604
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,214
We went in with a day,

605
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:52,849
figuring she'd counter
with a month.

606
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:54,400
We were fine with a week.

607
00:20:54,435 --> 00:20:56,269
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

608
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,386
But there will be
a third week.

609
00:20:57,404 --> 00:20:58,788
It will be called Friend Week.

610
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:00,607
It will be commemorating
this week,

611
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:01,891
the week that
my two best friends

612
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:03,109
became each other's
best friends.

613
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,028
I have a Friend Week present
for you right now.

614
00:21:05,062 --> 00:21:06,529
Here you go.

615
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:08,898
How did you already
have these?

616
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,399
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

617
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,399
