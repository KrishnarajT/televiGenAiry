1
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:03,000
It's because of you,

2
00:00:03,168 --> 00:00:05,586
our teachers, that every one
of these recreation classes

3
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:08,506
in this catalog shines like a jewel

4
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,574
in Pawnee's beautiful crown.

5
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,940
Unfortunately,
due to budget constraints,

6
00:00:15,065 --> 00:00:18,182
this year we will have to remove
five jewels from that crown.

7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,893
Excuse me?
Are you cutting our classes?

8
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:25,499
The city took away
$1,000 from our budget.

9
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:26,774
So I'm very sorry.

10
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:29,569
How will you decide
which classes to cut?

11
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:32,347
By attendance.
And student evaluations.

12
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:34,949
So just make sure
your students leave with a smile.

13
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:38,364
My class is called
"coping with terminal illness."

14
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:40,037
Hopefully your attendance is good.

15
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,415
Actually, no.

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,380
Hopefully it's bad.

17
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:46,502
Nobody's more upset about this
than me.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,700
I've been taking rec center classes
since I was in high school.

19
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:53,593
It's where I learned hair braiding,
how to make biscuits, french kissing.

20
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:56,929
It was just from a boy
in my biscuits class,

21
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,015
but either way, lesson learned.

My God.

28
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,246
You've never been to carnival.

29
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:24,822
- I wanna go.
- We have to get tickets in February

30
00:01:24,947 --> 00:01:26,500
to go to Rio De Janeiro.

31
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:30,586
I am on a date with Justin
in Indianapolis.

32
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,758
We've only been out a few times,
but every one of them has been amazing.

33
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:34,785
Cheers.

34
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,802
Last time,
we had a private tour and cocktails

35
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:39,877
at the indianapolis aquarium.

36
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:43,017
- That fish reminds me of my mom.
- Why?

37
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:45,895
It's just being really withholding.

38
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,689
Justin is the most interesting guy
I've ever dated.

39
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:52,276
- All I did was a little paperwork.
- He's being modest.

40
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:55,404
It is thanks to him
my family remains in this country.

41
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:57,272
And it was all pro bono.

42
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,367
You've got to try.

43
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:05,081
- That's really good.
- Isn't it great? It's camel stomach.

44
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:06,582
Is it?

45
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:08,459
I'm teasing. It's chicken.

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,879
Would you like to try it?

47
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,591
This is me.

48
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:18,302
So when am I gonna see you again?

49
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:21,722
I'm gonna be near Pawnee
on Tuesday.

50
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:24,183
Excellent.
I'll plan something exciting.

51
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,518
In fact,

52
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:29,313
Our date in Pawnee is gonna blow
Indianapolis out of the water.

53
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:30,481
All right.

54
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:33,859
- I'm gonna hold you to that.
- You better.

55
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:34,984
I will.

56
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:39,115
I've racked my brain

57
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:41,200
and I can't come up
with one exciting idea.

58
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,621
He once ate fried cockatoo
with a member of the Thal Royal Family.

59
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:49,001
Maybe just have him over
and cook him some chicken

60
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,168
and tell him it's Pawnee cockatoo.

61
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,130
A dinner party.
That's genius.

62
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,738
I'll invite
all my most interesting friends over,

63
00:02:56,863 --> 00:03:00,302
- we'll have this big rambling party...
- I meant more of a one-on-one thing.

64
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,627
I got it,
but I took your idea and made it better.

65
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:04,098
It's called a think tank.

66
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,642
- What is?
- Our lunches. Like think thanks.

67
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,676
Come over to my house at 2:00

68
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,029
and help me get ready.
Make sure that Mark's coming.

69
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:13,607
So much work to do.
You're my best friend, get out of here!

70
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,362
How many courses will there be?

71
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:19,488
Three.

72
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:21,390
Four.

73
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,618
- Not including dessert.
- So five courses.

74
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:27,246
Now it will be five courses.

75
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,566
If I wanted to bring
a large number of deviled eggs

76
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,286
but I didn't want to share them
with anyone else,

77
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:36,130
can you guarantee fridge space?

78
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:38,012
Just be there at 8:00.

79
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:41,942
I'm having an a-list dinner party
for Justin

80
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:45,054
and you, out of all my friends, come
from the most distant and exotic land.

81
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:46,472
South Carolina?

82
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,102
Save it for the party.
Can you make it?

83
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,275
For Justin, are you kidding?
I'm there.

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,468
Just don't invite
any boring people like jerry.

85
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:56,901
- What are you talking about?
- Don't worry about it.

86
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:03,824
Check it out.
Just practicing.

87
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:06,689
Isn't that polish gonna get
on people's butts when they sit down?

88
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:11,790
I'm having a party. And I thought
you could help me with serving

89
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,375
and taking people's coats.

90
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:14,877
Ten bucks an hour.

91
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:18,339
My guardian angel, I would love to.
Who's gonna be there?

92
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,685
Really fun people.

93
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:26,347
- Great. What's the occasion?
- Justin's coming to town.

94
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,964
Hey, it's me Justin.

95
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:33,395
Take my coat, but please be careful.
I got it from the king of Africa

96
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:36,563
when we were walking
on the Berlin wall together.

97
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:40,151
Really, Justin.
What instruments do you play?

98
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,311
Actually...

99
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:44,818
He's a pretty sick keyboardist.

100
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,034
I'm good to go.
That sounds great.

101
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,919
- Great.
- I'll see you there.

102
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,089
- Afternoon, Andy.
- Hi, Kyle.

103
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:53,874
Right before you sat down,

104
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,477
I noticed, did you have
some kind of stain on your ass

105
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:58,826
- or something, what was that?
- What?

106
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:02,207
You're good.

107
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,413
Welcome to my house.

108
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:10,138
I can't believe
you've never had me over.

109
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,233
Now I can.

110
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,820
I know, it's a little messy.
But I have a system.

111
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:25,823
I need you to help me
put the finishing touches on everything.

112
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,697
This newspaper's from November 1986.

113
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:32,072
The first rumblings of Iran contra.

114
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:33,414
Don't throw that out.

115
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:35,624
I think I need to call
child services

116
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:38,043
and have Leslie taken away
from herself.

117
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,798
Leslie, don't take this
the wrong way,

118
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,300
but your house
is like a crazy person's garage.

119
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:49,430
What is this birdhouse for?

120
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,747
Can we get rid of it?

121
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,505
- I might need it.
- What about this one?

122
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,397
If two birds come along.

123
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,067
Andy's gonna come over soon.
He can help us with all this stuff.

124
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:06,929
You need a team of professionals
to help.

125
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,765
I have an idea.

126
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,619
Is this Maria Portlesman

127
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,750
from "Organize your life
with Maria Portlesman"?

128
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:20,752
April, come here!

129
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:22,909
- What?
- Shake my hand.

130
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:23,964
Why?

131
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:27,843
To know if I've exfoliated too much.
I want Justin to respect my handshake.

132
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:29,428
Why do you care?

133
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,870
Justin is hip.

134
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,119
Pawnee is the opposite of hip.

135
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:36,739
People in this town
are just now getting into Nirvana.

136
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:40,886
I can't tell them what's going to happen
to Kurt Cobain in 1994.

137
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,278
It's like touching raw chicken.

138
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:49,031
Damn it.
Gonna have to re-foliate 'em.

139
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:53,464
I'll need some help
moving the boxes,

140
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,169
- but it's doable.
- Thank God.

141
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:58,165
- How much do I owe you?
- Please.

142
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,834
No charge.
I just appreciate the chance

143
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:03,921
to demonstrate how valuable my class is
to the rec center.

144
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,382
And I hope you'll keep that in mind.

145
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,260
I insist on paying.

146
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:13,389
I insist on demonstrating.

147
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,390
This isn't going
to affect my decision.

148
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:16,934
Of course not.

149
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,252
Stop winking.

150
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,855
What are you cooking?

151
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:22,940
Five courses.

152
00:07:23,373 --> 00:07:24,149
Of what?

153
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:26,360
Of what?

154
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,278
God.

155
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:33,575
So how's it looking?
It smells great.

156
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,619
The appetizers are almost ready.

157
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,997
They are a very good sampling
of what my level one class does.

158
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,668
Which I hope you'll keep in mind
when you're making your decisions.

159
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,712
- Tania, like I said over the phone...
- I know.

160
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:48,921
It won't influence your decision.
It's just that learning to cook

161
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:51,176
- is very important in this day and age.
- Is it?

162
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,984
Are you gonna be all right?

163
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:00,937
What?
'Cause of Mark and Justin?

164
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:03,938
They are just guests
at a really awesome dinner party

165
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,565
and I'll treat them as such.

166
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,520
That sounds very professional.

167
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,279
I promise I'll not spit in anyone's food
unless they should request that I do.

168
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,239
- Good.
- Did I do this right?

169
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,315
I don't know.

170
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:20,935
- Welcome to my humble abode.
- Well, thank you.

171
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:24,083
This is way cleaner
than the last time I was here.

172
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:25,251
You've been here?

173
00:08:27,185 --> 00:08:28,130
Right.

174
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:30,006
When was mark here before?

175
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:34,515
Sex.

176
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:38,370
I can't wait to talk
to Justin again.

177
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:42,699
Last time he told me how he snorkeled
with whale sharks in Madagascar.

178
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:47,274
That was after I told him
that I sometimes go swimming at the "Y".

179
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,299
Thank you, son.

180
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:54,446
I believe you've arranged accommodations
for these.

181
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:55,643
I have.

182
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:59,619
You didn't happen to hear about
the incident with mayor Gunderson's dog?

183
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,901
- It was a blood bath.
- No talking.

184
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:05,750
Everybody stop talking, until Justin
gets here. Don't use up your stories.

185
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:09,962
Somebody from animal services
is gonna get canned.

186
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,114
My God, what part of not talking
do you not understand?

187
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,057
Please have a good time
and shut your mouth.

188
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,845
I want this dinner party to go well.

189
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,432
There are very few things
I've asked for in this world.

190
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:23,739
To build a new park from scratch,
to eventually become president,

191
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,111
and to one day
solve a murder on a train.

192
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:28,359
I think it's fair
to add this to the list.

193
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,241
Guys, Justin's here.
That's Justin.

194
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,166
Everybody.
Start talking.

195
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:46,791
- I'm late.
- That's okay.

196
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:50,628
- Welcome to my very interesting party.
- Andy Dwyer.

197
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,713
Can't wait to catch up with him.

198
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:54,966
All right, Justin,
may I take your coat, sir?

199
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:56,684
Why, yeah. Thank you.

200
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:00,994
I finally get to hang out
with all your friends tonight.

201
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:03,120
It's gonna be super fun.
A blast.

202
00:10:03,245 --> 00:10:05,973
Really, the best and most exciting night
of your life.

203
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:07,998
I cannot overhype it enough.

204
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:10,815
All right, let's get started.

205
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:12,866
- What's up, J.?
- How are you doing?

206
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,632
- Justin.
- I have the swine flu.

207
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:15,695
She doesn't.

208
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,276
- Is that Justin's coat?
- Yeah. Isn't it awesome?

209
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:28,161
He got it in Cambodia
when he was hiking mount Everest.

210
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:31,252
- Let's put up gum in his pockets.
- That's genius. But I can't.

211
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:35,298
Leslie's being super cool to me.
Can't screw over her boyfriend's jacket.

212
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,741
I'll do it
when you're not in the room then.

213
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:39,836
That would be terrible.

214
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,682
I'm being sarcastic.
That would be awesome.

215
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:47,224
God, India is so amazing.
Let me tell you something.

216
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:49,627
That is my absolute
favorite place to travel.

217
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:51,646
Where did you say
your parents were from?

218
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:52,995
The south part.

219
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:55,520
The southern part's always
the best part of anything.

220
00:10:56,145 --> 00:10:58,853
Have you been to the Kanmian mosque,
down in Tamil Nadu?

221
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:01,947
Are you kidding?
My uncle practically runs the place.

222
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,576
I've prayed there.
It's sick.

223
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,599
Tell me everything, right now.

224
00:11:05,724 --> 00:11:08,183
One sec, I just gotta hit the loo,

225
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:10,416
as those bastard British imperialists
would say.

226
00:11:13,384 --> 00:11:15,870
Last time I was in India,
I was eight years old.

227
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:18,479
And I stayed inside the whole time
playing video games.

228
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:19,904
I gotta bone up.

229
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:23,227
Fourth largest coal reserves
in the world.

230
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,068
This is the best
old fashioned I have ever had.

231
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,000
Where did you find this bartender?

232
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:31,935
I think, I don't know.
Like maybe the yellow pages?

233
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:34,340
There's no way
that you're paying him enough.

234
00:11:34,465 --> 00:11:37,175
If you want, I could teach you
the secret to great...

235
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:40,529
Ann, get over here.

236
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:42,481
- I'm here, already.
- Good.

237
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:44,352
Do you think
this party's going well?

238
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:46,452
Can you see Justin?
Is he having fun?

239
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,746
Justin is over there
talking to Mark happily.

240
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:52,899
Okay, good.
Yeah, good.

241
00:11:53,024 --> 00:11:55,274
I'm just gonna casually make my...

242
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,006
So my face is literally on fire,

243
00:11:59,515 --> 00:12:02,809
but it's this weird chemical
so no one can see the flames.

244
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:05,346
I'm dancing around, freaking out.

245
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:08,535
I end up having to dunk my face
into a bucket of sand.

246
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,312
- Unreal.
- Unreal?

247
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:12,119
Oh, my God.
That is unbelievable.

248
00:12:12,244 --> 00:12:13,687
Isn't it, Ann?
Unbelievable.

249
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:16,821
It didn't happen to me.
It was a kid I knew from camp.

250
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,277
But a great story is a great story.

251
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:23,516
Plus the kid can't tell it.
His mouth melted.

252
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,743
Dinner is served.

253
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:29,718
Excellent.

254
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,171
I'm sorry, are we late?

255
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:40,141
What the hell are you doing?

256
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:42,740
How could you invite Wendy
when Ron's here?

257
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:45,191
He's gonna wrap her up
in his moustache and take her home.

258
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:47,562
We agreed to invite
interesting people for Justin,

259
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:49,249
and Wendy is an interesting person.

260
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:51,431
And I told you
that you should talk to her.

261
00:12:51,556 --> 00:12:53,677
- Now's your chance.
- That makes sense.

262
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:56,672
No, it doesn't!
Not cool. At all!

263
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:01,579
- He'll get over it.
- No, I won't!

264
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:05,542
The first course
is a mexican bean soup.

265
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:10,653
Are these peppers for consuming?

266
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:12,778
I wouldn't.
They're very hot.

267
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:14,549
I'm gonna give it a try.

268
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:19,477
- Hot.
- You're very brave.

269
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:22,070
Please. That was one of
the tiny ones.

270
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:24,044
This is how you eat it

271
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,509
Don't do that, Tom.

272
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:36,950
This is something.

273
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:38,564
Justin, Derek and Ben are gay.

274
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,630
But often on occasion,

275
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:43,230
April will have relations
with Derek.

276
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:46,109
Right? Crazy stuff.
Discuss that.

277
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:49,825
There's not much more to discuss.
You kind of explained it all.

278
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:53,787
Who else is gay?

279
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,957
Tom, I need your help.
There was a lull.

280
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,513
I saw Justin yawn.

281
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:01,445
Tell me this is a sign of excitement
in India or something.

282
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,671
Tom, focus.

283
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:04,381
God, you're no help.

284
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:07,798
Yes, just to be clear,
this will in no way influence me.

285
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:11,263
It won't affect my decision and it has
no bearing on the future of your class.

286
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,184
Hey, little buddy.
Everything okay?

287
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,073
That took a long time.

288
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,146
Poor Tommy.
He has a very frail colon.

289
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:21,631
I feel your pain, brother.

290
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:25,136
Hottest thing I ever put into my mouth
was in this remote village in Brazil.

291
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:26,404
This sounds good.

292
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:28,739
They take a little bit
of scorpion poison

293
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:30,530
and they serve it to you...

294
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:32,117
I wonder who that is.

295
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:33,954
- Who could that be?
- More people.

296
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,579
A belly dancer?

297
00:14:37,263 --> 00:14:38,263
What?

298
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:41,335
It's weird, but...

299
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:43,504
she just showed up.

300
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:46,090
I'm not the kind of person
that's gonna throw

301
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,932
someone out or, you know,

302
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:49,301
not let them in

303
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:50,928
if they randomly show up.

304
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:55,724
I don't know how they all got here.

305
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:59,144
You know, people hear
about a killer party at Knope's house,

306
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,252
at Knope's house,
they all come a-runnin'.

307
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,314
You don't do origami every day,
do you?

308
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,477
They brought in a little entertainment,
thank God.

309
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:12,075
'Cause that Justin is so boring.

310
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:14,654
What are you talking about?
He's incredible.

311
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,168
Yeah, he's not gay,

312
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,582
but if he were, I would totally
break up with Ben for him.

313
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,224
Yeah, I would understand.

314
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:22,461
- He's amazing, right, April?
- Right, April?

315
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,029
Don't we love him?

316
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,680
Yeah, he's actually kind of awesome.

317
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:31,992
You're underage.

318
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:34,665
I could lose my liquor license,
I'm sorry.

319
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,892
Are you having fun?

320
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:38,643
All I can say is this is not

321
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,456
not what I was expecting.

322
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:43,899
- I cannot believe there's more.
- There's not.

323
00:15:46,542 --> 00:15:47,592
Miss Knope.

324
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,239
I understand that you're currently
evaluating the rec center teachers.

325
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:53,092
You're doing what?

326
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:55,716
I demand an evaluation.

327
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:58,663
What course do you teach?

328
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:01,580
When it comes to choosing
accounting software,

329
00:16:01,705 --> 00:16:03,835
there's no accounting for taste.

330
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,013
The advantage of Quickbooks Pro

331
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:11,176
is that it's easy to assemble
a list of vendors...

332
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:12,877
Well, this is great.

333
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:14,935
I'm heading home,

334
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,647
so as not to have to be here
anymore.

335
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,009
My office first thing tomorrow.

336
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:23,107
Yeah, I think we're probably
gonna take off too.

337
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,440
The demonstration
takes another 45 minutes.

338
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:28,599
Yeah, guys, please.
Everybody, can you just stay, okay?

339
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,224
Justin, would you...

340
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:36,993
I promise you, Miss Knope,
this disciplinary committee will go over

341
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,870
every detail of what happened
last night

342
00:16:39,038 --> 00:16:42,429
and we will determine whether you are
guilty of abusing your power.

343
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:44,835
Do you have anything
to say before we begin?

344
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,443
Just that I'm looking forward

345
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:50,048
to the truth coming out.

346
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:52,249
I would like to say that Leslie

347
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:55,512
is incapable of using people
for her own gain.

348
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:58,324
But I can't because

349
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:00,611
Leslie loves using people
for her own gain.

350
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:04,729
If I may, Phil, I'd like
to say something to Tom on the record.

351
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,716
This has all been on the record.

352
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:09,372
I'm very sorry
that I invited Wendy to the party.

353
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:12,487
- Is Wendy one of the teachers?
- No, she's my soon-to-be ex-wife.

354
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,932
And hopefully
then-to-be future wife.

355
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:17,085
Look, I'm really sorry.

356
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,619
I put a new romance
in front of an old friendship.

357
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,389
I put a beautiful man

358
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:25,375
in front of an adorable man child.

359
00:17:25,543 --> 00:17:26,569
You're ruining it.

360
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:28,443
I put a big white stallion

361
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:30,297
in front of a little brown pony.

362
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:31,965
Totally uncalled for.

363
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:33,967
Ron Swanson will be next.

364
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,430
When it comes
to government hearings,

365
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,986
the only type of witness
I enjoy being

366
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:40,461
is a hostile one.

367
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:42,543
That's why I intend to answer

368
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:45,796
every one of their questions
with a question.

369
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,719
Were you aware
that all of the entertainment and food

370
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:51,276
was provided by teachers?

371
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,112
Would I have stayed if I knew that?

372
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,573
- I don't know. Would you have?
- Would you have?

373
00:17:57,194 --> 00:17:58,643
No, I wouldn't have.

374
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,204
Did you hear Leslie
make any promises?

375
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,329
What constitutes a promise?

376
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,873
A quid pro quo.

377
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:06,875
Do you know Latin?

378
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:11,598
Are we done?

379
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,144
Can I get a shine?

380
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,862
No, I'm sorry.
We're closed.

381
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:19,596
Due to betrayment.

382
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,682
I'm sorry. But I don't know
what you're talking about.

383
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:25,165
Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

384
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,234
- Whose name is Justin.
- Justin?

385
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,297
I would...

386
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,988
but he's probably too busy...

387
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,984
cleaning gum out
of his coat pockets.

388
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:43,745
Unbetrayed.

389
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:46,915
So you don't work
for the government,

390
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,000
and you had no idea
that these people

391
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,200
were teachers
from the local rec center.

392
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,553
I was simply attending a dinner party
at my friend's house.

393
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:57,373
- Why is he here, Ms. Knope?
- That will become clear.

394
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:59,761
Mr. Anderson, could you please
describe that evening?

395
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:02,353
Well, I had a very pleasant time.

396
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:04,734
And from my perspective,
there was no abuse of power

397
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:07,533
with respect to Ms. Knope
and any of her various guests.

398
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:09,187
Could you define pleasant?

399
00:19:09,517 --> 00:19:11,776
Did you have a good time?
Did you have a great time?

400
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:14,442
Be specific, and do you remember
that you're under oath?

401
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,402
I had an amazing time.

402
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:18,321
But you fell asleep.

403
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:20,949
God, I'm so sorry.
No... Look, I... you know,

404
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:24,132
I'd been given a case the night before.
So I had to stay up all night working.

405
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:27,038
- I didn't want to cancel.
- You should have told me.

406
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:29,707
Are you kidding me?
I had an awesome time.

407
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,795
Which had nothing to do
with the rec center teachers.

408
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:36,103
No further questions.

409
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:38,669
We're gonna take a break,

410
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,418
and we'll let you know
what we decide in about an hour.

411
00:19:41,976 --> 00:19:42,846
Great.

412
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:45,348
I will see you later.

413
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,851
I'm in the middle of official business
so I can't talk.

414
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,561
- But yes, you will.
- Great.

415
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,734
So did you get that?
He said "amazing" and "awesome".

416
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:59,077
So I'm gonna drive up
and see him next weekend.

417
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:01,509
There's some kabuki theater
festival happening.

418
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,818
Great.
You're so relaxed.

419
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,618
You're not freaking out at all?

420
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:08,872
We've reached our decision.

421
00:20:09,786 --> 00:20:12,250
We're not going to take
any further action at this time.

422
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,425
It really helped
that you asked for this hearing yourself

423
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,543
and that you made financial restitution
out of your own pocket.

424
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,468
But I think we both know
you skirted a line here.

425
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,094
You turned yourself in?
Why?

426
00:20:27,219 --> 00:20:29,964
Well, I did something wrong
and I felt bad.

427
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:33,395
So this morning, I donated
$1,000 to the rec center

428
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,266
so everybody
could keep teaching their classes.

429
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:39,444
- So why did you ask for the hearing?
- Are you kidding, Ann?

430
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,360
It's every girl's dream
to ask a dude

431
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:43,880
how their date went
under penalty of perjury.

432
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:45,314
I'm not proud of my actions,

433
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,748
but the most important thing is there is
an official government document

434
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,398
that proves my dinner party
kicked ass.

435
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:55,521
Tommy Hav.

436
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,332
- J-train.
- What's up, buddy?

437
00:20:57,501 --> 00:21:00,012
This might be none of my business,
but...

438
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,254
You need to ask Wendy out.

439
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,148
For reals this time.

440
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,384
Did Leslie tell you?

441
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:09,249
She didn't need to.

442
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:11,325
I saw it.

443
00:21:12,197 --> 00:21:13,262
I'm not gay,

444
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:15,754
but you're the most incredible man
I've ever met.

445
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:17,504
That doesn't sound gay at all.

446
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:19,561
See you later.

447
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,166
- Take care.
- Bye, brother.

448
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,496
You sure you don't wanna come
hang out for a minute?
