00:00:01,808 --> 00:00:02,797
Good morning.

2
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:06,551
Swiss family Ron-binson...
That hat is dope.

3
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:10,588
You mind if I rock
that bad larry on my dome?

4
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:13,516
Wear it, on my head?
Try it on the ladies?

5
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:16,561
Be my guest.

6
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:20,273
I'm Tom.
I have a raccoon on my head.

7
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:26,112
My friend was digging your trash,
and we may have a lot in common.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,815
I'm Tom. Would you like
to see a movie sometime?

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,324
Are you a raccoon?

10
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:33,754
Because you've been running
around my hat all da...

11
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,239
Head all day.

12
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:37,707
Girl, you're more precious
than precious.

13
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,450
Nice hat.
Want to bone?

14
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,010
That's you talking to me.

15
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:46,171
How about...

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,511
"Yes, I am a hunter,
and it's you season"?

17
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:54,140
That's great.
I got to get back out there.

18
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:56,615
You know what they say...
Animal on the head,

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,102
manimal in the bed.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,271
Damn, girl,
your hotness killed my raccoon.

21
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:02,855
I have a raccoon hat.
I'm an interesting person.

22
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,347
- Any luck?
- No.

23
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:10,505
Didn't work out
as well as I thought it would.

24
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,582
Well, better luck next time.

25
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:15,620
- I tried. It just didn't seem like...
- I love that hat.

26
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:17,997
Thank you, ma'am.

32
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,168
Hey, Ron, I have a surprise for you.

33
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:45,149
Meet me at Harvey James park
at 11:30.

34
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:47,026
- Why?
- It's a surprise.

35
00:01:47,285 --> 00:01:49,779
- What's the surprise?
- If I told you, it would ruin it.

36
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,114
- What's the surprise it would ruin?
- I can't tell you.

37
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:55,845
My first wife, Tammy, tried throwing me
a surprise birthday party.

38
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,080
When I saw my friends
hiding through the window,

39
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:02,124
I called the cops, and told them
people had broken into my home.

40
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:05,861
- Not big on surprises.
- But you're gonna like this one.

41
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,720
- What is it?
- I'm not telling you.

42
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,507
And I'm not gonna tell anybody.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,993
Okay, I'll tell you.

44
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,680
We're putting together
the parks department summer catalog,

45
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,670
and the big surprise
is I am going to reunite

46
00:02:19,795 --> 00:02:22,895
all the living, former
parks directors at a picnic,

47
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,780
record the whole thing, and write
about it in the welcome letter.

48
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:29,156
It's the biggest catalog
of the year.

49
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:33,285
Think of the September issue of Vogue,
but it's more important to Pawnee,

50
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:35,950
mainly because
we don't get vogue here.

51
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:39,132
I'm gonna move this yearning ad
to the centerfold.

52
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,863
Centerfold? Always the best part.
Am I right, Justin?

53
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:45,442
Damn. You broke up six weeks ago.

54
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,921
- Jerry, show me your softball pictures.
- Here you go, chief.

55
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:53,679
- Good job. Nice work.
- Wait. Isn't that that creepy guy?

56
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:55,261
Morgan, the pedophile?

57
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,722
Yeah, it is.

58
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:01,359
Come on, I didn't know that.
He seemed okay.

59
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:04,228
We had dinner together.

60
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:06,969
I don't know if I made it clear,
but I don't want any sex offenders

61
00:03:07,094 --> 00:03:08,406
in our parks catalog.

62
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,075
I will photoshop his face.

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,445
Can you photoshop your life
with better decisions?

64
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:15,519
April, enough.
Cover photo... Tom, you're up.

65
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:18,639
This catalog is basically like an ad
for the parks department,

66
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,619
and I love ads.

67
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,122
I love magazine ads
for flavored vodkas,

68
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:24,999
billboards for designer jeans.

69
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:27,585
I tivo through shows
to get to the ads.

70
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:29,795
I love ads.

71
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,256
What are we trying to do
with this catalog?

72
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,050
We're trying to sell Pawnee
on our summer classes.

73
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:39,428
How do we do that?
With one perfect, captivating image.

74
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:43,684
Modern life.
Where are we running?

75
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:46,771
Sometimes what we want
is not always where we are.

76
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:48,898
Next slide.

77
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:50,527
Are we alone?

78
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:53,052
Is the real winter
inside our hearts?

79
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,643
We're all struggling for definition

80
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,531
in a world that resists
our inquiries.

81
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,406
This isn't gonna work
for many reasons.

82
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,693
One... This is a summer catalog,
two... That was complete gibberish,

83
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,830
and three... That child
looks like it's abandoned,

84
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:06,582
so basically...

85
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,251
Next slide.

86
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,941
Weird.
How did that...?

87
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:16,608
That's a personal photo.

88
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,233
That's...
Shouldn't be... It must've...

89
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:21,038
You know, I got to say,

90
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:23,028
That could work as our cover photo.

91
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,533
I'm cool with it if you guys are.
It's a high-res photo.

92
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:28,437
I don't know if I have time for this,
so let's just pick a good photo, okay?

93
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:31,190
What do you want, Leslie?
Parents pushing a kid on a swing?

94
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,275
Yeah, exactly.
Get me that.

95
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:35,545
Okay, I got to go.

96
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,615
What is he thinking?

97
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:41,367
"Why is my cup so tiny?"

98
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,122
What are you doing here?

99
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,182
Happy six-month anniversary.

100
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:52,926
I got you a gift.
It's a chicken-salad sandwich.

101
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:56,005
And I don't want you to feel bad
about not getting me anything,

102
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:59,134
- because I never exp...
- Swiss army watch, mofo.

103
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:01,679
Well done, Perkins.

104
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,558
- You like it?
- Thank you so much. It's so nice.

105
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:09,917
Are you allowed to kiss me
in a hospital room?

106
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:12,021
Don't worry about it.
He's dead.

107
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:15,468
I'm just kidding.
He's sleeping.

108
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:19,196
Yeah, our relationship
is going well, really well.

109
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:22,469
That guy really seemed dead.

110
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:26,312
Nice!

111
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,430
Here, catch this.

112
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,516
You got me in the face.

113
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,836
That one hurt.

114
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:36,760
- You have a good arm.
- I played softball in high school.

115
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:38,507
I played baseball in high school.

116
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,347
- Shut up.
- That's the boy version of softball.

117
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:44,346
Guys, don't play with the food, okay?
We need this for the picnic.

118
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:46,633
- We have everything?
- Yes. Three picnic baskets,

119
00:05:46,758 --> 00:05:49,616
- assorted cheeses, grapes, wine.
- Smoked salmon?

120
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:52,724
April threw
the smoked salmon on the roof.

121
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:54,857
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,947
Where's Leslie?
She just texted me from your phone

123
00:05:58,072 --> 00:06:01,067
and said she left her phone at home
and that I should come here immediately,

124
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:02,740
and why did I believe that?

125
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,873
Maybe in your heart,
you knew it was from me,

126
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,496
but you came anyway.

127
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,621
Nope.

128
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:11,238
Would you stop texting me that you
are having a city-planning emergency.

129
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:13,584
There's no such thing
as a city-planning emergency.

130
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:15,732
Look at you two.

131
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,354
Ann Perkins, Mark Brendanawicz.

132
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,729
Ann-danawicz...

133
00:06:19,937 --> 00:06:22,885
Or Merkins.
No, Ann-danawicz.

134
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:24,593
You two should be models...

135
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,402
Maybe on the cover
of the parks department summer catalog?

136
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,083
That's not the reason
you called me in here, right?

137
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,583
'cause I just finished a 12-hour shift.
If that's the reason...

138
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,573
It'd be a huge favor for Leslie.
You know how important this is to her.

139
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,448
- Well, I am in.
- Dude.

140
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:39,693
I am.

141
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:43,227
We don't have any pictures
of just the two of us.

142
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:46,617
Plus, I've always said
we should go on more dates with Tom.

143
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:47,991
Yeah, you have,

144
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,552
and thank God an opportunity
presented itself.

145
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,831
- See, win-win.
- You're gonna change, right?

146
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:54,233
I guess.

147
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:57,669
Would it kill you to put some lipstick?
Do you even own lipstick?

148
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,909
This is probably the 1st time in history
these four great men

149
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,050
have been in the same place
at the same time.

150
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,718
It kind of makes you...

151
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:07,642
What is this?

152
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:10,115
Sweater swap. She noticed.
You were right.

153
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,851
Somebody's here.
Okay, guys, just act normal, please.

154
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,058
Just be like normal people.
Hello. Hi, David Moser.

155
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:18,691
I'm Leslie Knope.
It is such an honor to meet you.

156
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:21,903
Right. How long is this gonna take?

157
00:07:22,362 --> 00:07:25,406
Not very long. I realize, of course,
you're a very busy man.

158
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,742
I love parks. I don't know
if that's something I've told before.

159
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,619
So having a picnic

160
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:33,857
with all the former, living
parks department directors...

161
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,542
Guess who just checked
something off her bucket list.

162
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,990
Clarence Carrington, David Moser,

163
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,255
Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson...

164
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:43,298
Gathered together on a beautiful day

165
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:44,675
in this beautiful park.

166
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,424
I think we should just take a moment
and appreciate how lucky we are.

167
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,954
I thought you were dead, Clarence.

168
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,967
No, I'm gonna outlive you,
then I'm gonna nail your wife.

169
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:57,019
- Screw you, you old coot.
- Classic David. You're worse than Ron.

170
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,856
Shut your damn mouth, Tansley.

171
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,624
Okay, great, let's go.

172
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,071
When I say "parks",
you say "department".

173
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:05,196
Parks.

174
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:06,931
Parks.

175
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:08,056
Apartment!

176
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,699
Oh, boy, this is taking a lot longer
than I thought it would.

177
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:14,595
Can you run up ahead
and set up the picnic?

178
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,667
Sure.

179
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,838
Where are they going with the food?

180
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:20,837
I'm starving.
I only had one breakfast.

181
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:21,837
Relax.

182
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:24,673
What was going on back there?
Why all the sniping?

183
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:27,637
I'm not exactly sure.
The only one I know is Michael,

184
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,697
and we're not exactly best friends.

185
00:08:29,822 --> 00:08:30,822
I'm hungry.

186
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,941
Don't be such a baby.

187
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:35,225
I cooked you some bacon
for a trail snack.

188
00:08:35,393 --> 00:08:37,373
- I ate it already.
- What?

189
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:39,813
I could smell it in your purse
before I even parked.

190
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:42,654
And now it's gone,
and I hate everything.

191
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,772
Good, good, good.

192
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:48,542
All right.

193
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:51,158
I think we got the boring,
cliché shot that Leslie wanted.

194
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,099
- That's it?
We're done?
- Not even close.

195
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,038
Now the real art begins.

196
00:08:57,582 --> 00:08:59,833
Step one...
Nail this photo shoot

197
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,709
with an amazing, iconic image.

198
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,879
Step two...
Book some outside gigs.

199
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,388
Step three...
Have sex with a model.

200
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:09,913
Step four... Step in front
of the camera, become a model.

201
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:14,306
Go, yes. Keep slithering,
keep slithering!

202
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:18,618
Ann, can you give me something,
anything in the face?

203
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:21,688
- What do you want me to do?
- Do what Mark's doing. He's great.

204
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:22,965
Keep slithering!

205
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,040
I'm not doing anything, so...

206
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:28,529
Clarence, why don't you describe

207
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:30,939
the first summer Pawnee catalog?

208
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:32,912
I remember.

209
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,702
That first year,
we offered four classes.

210
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,820
I actually taught homemaking.

211
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,332
Women were not allowed
to teach back then.

212
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,460
Really? I thought there were
female teachers way before then.

213
00:09:43,642 --> 00:09:45,087
Not in my department.

214
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,013
Well, times have changed.

215
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:51,380
I'm deputy director now,
but I'm hoping someday

216
00:09:51,505 --> 00:09:53,687
to be the first female director
of the department.

217
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:55,810
I don't think that's a good idea.

218
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:58,572
Women need a lot of blood

219
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,687
to flow through
to their baby centers,

220
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:05,232
which leaves less
to the brain, you see.

221
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:07,475
Sure.

222
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:09,966
I'd stay away from leadership roles,

223
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:11,786
for your own safety.

224
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,412
Maybe I should write
a song about a picnic.

225
00:10:18,586 --> 00:10:20,441
Where'd you come up with that idea?

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,667
The picnic we're having.
I already have the perfect title.

227
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,212
- "Life is a picnic."
- That's good.

228
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,735
How about "life is a picnic...

229
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:31,570
"with you"?

230
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,970
Then it could be about a girl...
Or Peyton Manning.

231
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:38,974
You want to help me
write the lyrics?

232
00:10:39,501 --> 00:10:40,701
Yeah, totally.

233
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:43,270
We should grab a drink
after this at tucker's.

234
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:46,541
Yeah, I would do that.
That sounds fun.

235
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,169
I just have to get my stuff
from the office.

236
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:52,185
But that's...
That would be cool.

237
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:56,783
David, what was it exactly
that called you to the parks department?

238
00:10:56,951 --> 00:11:00,519
I was in public works for eight years,
but the director was pretty young.

239
00:11:00,644 --> 00:11:02,936
Clarence was old and weak,

240
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:07,085
so I put in for a transfer,
swooped in, and pushed him out.

241
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,686
There was no other reason
you wanted the job?

242
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:14,885
Just the money and the pension.

243
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:17,557
The actual job's a nightmare.

244
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:20,779
I mean, who gives a crap
about this crap?

245
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,814
Well, David,
I think we've talked enough.

246
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:30,073
Mark, that's great.
Bobby, great.

247
00:11:30,198 --> 00:11:31,967
Ann, you look miserable!

248
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,542
Terrible, terrible!

249
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:35,714
Come on, Ann, what are we doing?

250
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,241
Maxim or Good housekeeping?

251
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:39,284
I'm not sure
which one is the insult.

252
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:41,330
If there's anyone
that's doing a photo shoot

253
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:43,558
about the dangers of eating
undercooked chicken,

254
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:45,540
I can give you Ann's phone number.

255
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,809
Okay, let's stop for a second.

256
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:49,906
Bobby, I love how you work.

257
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:52,311
Take as many
juice boxes as you want.

258
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:54,496
In fact, grab me one too.
Make it an apple.

259
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:56,760
Mark, great job.
You can have a juice box too.

260
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:01,483
Take a walk with me.
In a million years, I never thought

261
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,517
you would be the problem
with this photo shoot.

262
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,978
Didn't you just plan this,
like, two hours ago?

263
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:07,875
I just don't get it.

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,148
How could someone so hot
be so bad at looking hot?

265
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:12,442
I'm sorry I'm not
a professional model.

266
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,237
And screaming "make your face
better" doesn't help.

267
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:17,504
Well, I'm sorry.
Your face just isn't working.

268
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:20,367
And we need to do something
to distract from this boring area.

269
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,498
Now, I didn't want to have to do this,
but we may have to go nude.

270
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,832
Fair enough. I totally understand,
but we should get one for safety.

271
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,876
Okay, guys, we're almost there.
It's right up here.

272
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:33,844
You shouldn't be leading us. If you're
menstruating, you'll attract bears.

273
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:35,802
Holy God.

274
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,341
Here we are.

275
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:40,512
Eat.

276
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:45,041
It hasn't gone exactly as I'd hoped,
but I got them all here,

277
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,212
and we're gonna have
a beautiful picnic.

278
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:49,157
It's gonna...
It's gonna be good.

279
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,091
I just whizzed on a butterfly.

280
00:12:56,613 --> 00:13:00,407
As you know, I'm working
on my welcome letter for the catalog.

281
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:03,785
You should just copy the Eagleton one.
I used to just copy the Eagleton one.

282
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,114
Did you? I was hoping that maybe you
could talk to me a little bit

283
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,519
about how the department
has changed since you ran it.

284
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:12,669
I think you've done a wonderful job
maintaining the parks.

285
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:15,589
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate that.
Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?

286
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:18,307
In a way.
Pencil-pushing wasn't really my thing,

287
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,126
but I did love the parks themselves.

288
00:13:20,251 --> 00:13:22,886
- That was the best part of the job.
- Isn't it? I totally agree.

289
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,867
Well, thank goodness for you.

290
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,321
Yes, thank goodness for Michael.

291
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:30,087
Are you still on parole, by the way?

292
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:32,230
Very funny, Ron.

293
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,107
- Yes, Ron, I am.
- What?

294
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:38,089
He smoked pot in the office
and in all the parks constantly.

295
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:40,238
In fairness to me,
it was a different time.

296
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:43,009
It was the early '90s,
but also it's ridiculous

297
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:44,934
that marijuana is illegal.

298
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:47,599
Thomas Jefferson grew hemp.

299
00:13:48,096 --> 00:13:51,080
Alcohol is legal, but pot isn't?

300
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,790
That makes sense to you, Ron?

301
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,880
I'm sorry.
I can't hear hippies.

302
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:00,970
So if you had to sleep with one
of the old guys, who would it be?

303
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,655
- The super old one.
- Really?

304
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,977
I'm an eyebrow girl.

305
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:08,968
I want to make out with him
and chew his eyebrows off.

306
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:11,552
That is... really gross.

307
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:13,855
Anybody got any water?

308
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:16,867
"Oh, I want water. I'm so old.
I need to drink water."

309
00:14:16,992 --> 00:14:19,043
- Stop it.
- Stop taunting him.

310
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,862
I don't need your help, jailbird.

311
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,533
If there's any unclaimed meat or cheese,
I would like to claim it.

312
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:27,146
- Yeah, like you claimed my job?
- Yes, exactly like that,

313
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:29,872
- in that I wanted it, and I took it.
- You know what I would love?

314
00:14:29,997 --> 00:14:32,306
I'd love if anybody
just said something positive

315
00:14:32,431 --> 00:14:34,334
about... I don't know... Anything.

316
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:37,963
I agree. Let's just relax,
smoke another "j", and all calm down.

317
00:14:38,131 --> 00:14:38,932
Another?

318
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:41,591
By the way, it's ridiculous
that pot is illegal.

319
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:45,005
It grows...
In the ground.

320
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,406
I've planted marijuana
in community gardens

321
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:49,516
all over the city,
and it hasn't hurt anyone.

322
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:51,813
- What?
- Michael, you are one pot-loving

323
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:54,229
♪ mother *** pain in the rectum.

324
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:55,206
Stop it.

325
00:14:55,331 --> 00:14:57,441
You're all being
awful, horrible men.

326
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:00,360
Your little friend come to visit?

327
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:04,448
If you mention anything about women

328
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:06,232
or menstruation

329
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:09,911
or anything, I'm gonna take your face,
and I'll shove it in those brambles.

330
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,710
- Yes.
- No, you're next, buddy.

331
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:13,457
Andy!
Let's take this picture.

332
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,168
Get out of your seat, turds.
Line up over there.

333
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,920
Come on.
Just please try to look human,

334
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:20,290
and not so evil.

335
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,924
Everybody, looky here.
One, two, three... Thank you so much

336
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:25,260
for the wonderful memories.
Take your stuff and go.

337
00:15:25,428 --> 00:15:27,636
Can we do one funny-face one?

338
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:32,726
Do you have that picture that Andy took?
Maybe I'll run it without any text.

339
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,609
I tried to photoshop it
to make it look like they were happy.

340
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:39,024
It was really hard.
Their mouths are just so old.

341
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,276
God, look at these horrible men.

342
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,945
You know, I don't even know
if I want them in my catalog.

343
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:46,740
Would you like...
These men in your catalog?

344
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,945
Oh, my God, April.
That's disgusting.

345
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,203
What? Look how generous
they're being with each other.

346
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:53,082
And here's the obstruction series.

347
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,329
What do you think?
Amazing, right?

348
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,250
I call this one "the future."

349
00:15:58,316 --> 00:15:59,586
It's completely blurry.

350
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:02,096
Yes, it is, Ann.

351
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:05,759
And the ones we took on the swing...
The normal ones?

352
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,308
You mean the "unhappy wife" photos?

353
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:12,265
Oh, my God.
These are even worse somehow.

354
00:16:13,298 --> 00:16:14,351
I look miserable.

355
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,061
You do look kind of miserable.

356
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:18,516
Now you know what I meant by,
"make your face better".

357
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:20,653
Was there something wrong, Ann?

358
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:22,984
Well, I'd just gotten off
a long shift.

359
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:25,695
- He was being really annoying.
- Mark looks happy.

360
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,199
Please don't use these, okay?

361
00:16:29,836 --> 00:16:31,486
Let's grab some dinner.

362
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:32,649
Sure.

363
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,541
You want me to read you
what I have so far in my welcome letter?

364
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:38,821
Nothing...

365
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:42,379
Because you and your jerk predecessors
didn't give me anything to work with.

366
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,877
Did you...

367
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:47,133
Print this out?
I heard the printer going.

368
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,302
You could've handed me
a blank piece of paper.

369
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,367
Oh, wisdom...
Finally.

370
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:52,639
Thank you so much.

371
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:55,401
You can also keep the photo.
Thanks for the memories.

372
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:57,018
Good God.

373
00:16:57,186 --> 00:16:59,886
- I don't remember this.
- That's the wrong one.

374
00:17:00,301 --> 00:17:02,190
But the real one's very bad as well.

375
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:06,811
I'm replacing the letter with this ad
for yearning by Dennis Feinstein.

376
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,147
So good-bye, distilled wisdom
of 50 years of experience.

377
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:12,075
Hello, disgusting fragrance flap.

378
00:17:13,205 --> 00:17:14,578
Let me buy you dinner.

379
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:16,705
I insist you buy me dinner.

380
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:19,597
Get a drink or whatever.
It's cool.

381
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:20,999
- I.d.?
- I'm 24.

382
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,374
No, you're not.

383
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:25,749
Okay, I'm 25...
No old jokes, please.

384
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:26,756
I.d.

385
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:36,435
It says right here you're 20.

386
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,103
You're not even
gonna show me a fake?

387
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,356
Sometimes the confidence
confuses people.

388
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,696
- You're good, bro.
- You know what?

389
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,312
I think I'll just...
I'm gonna...

390
00:17:48,988 --> 00:17:51,205
I know another bar
that always lets me in,

391
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,014
if you just want to go there.

392
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:56,703
Yeah, actually...
I should be going home.

393
00:17:57,194 --> 00:17:59,831
I got a lot of stuff to do,
so I should go home...

394
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,241
Clean and stuff.

395
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:06,498
Yeah, okay, cool.
Yeah, I got to...

396
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,757
- go home too, so...
- All right.

397
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,174
See ya.

398
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:15,096
Later.

399
00:18:17,658 --> 00:18:19,775
- The usual, Marta.
- Me too, Marta.

400
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:21,111
You got it.

401
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,040
I really made love
to the pooch on this one.

402
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:28,487
- Screwed the pooch?
- I don't like that term. It's vulgar.

403
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:34,949
That sucked today. I'm sorry.
There's no other way to say it.

404
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,527
They're a bunch
of career bureaucrats.

405
00:18:37,652 --> 00:18:39,238
What did you think?

406
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,775
"You are the next link
in a wonderful chain

407
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,748
"that links back
to when Pawnee was founded.

408
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:47,243
"And we believe in you, and support you,
and we'll be following your career.

409
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:48,855
"You are the chosen one."

410
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,923
Or something.

411
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,421
Well, okay, so that was the problem.

412
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:55,540
You know what the worst part is,
is I want to be parks director,

413
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:58,264
but every single person
who was parks director hated their job

414
00:18:58,432 --> 00:19:00,475
and hated everyone they worked with.

415
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,021
Are we gonna hate
each other someday?

416
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,626
I don't think so.

417
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:09,609
I think we're gonna be fine.

418
00:19:11,438 --> 00:19:12,765
Anyway, the point's moot,

419
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,322
because you're park director now,
and you're not going anywhere,

420
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,257
and I'm not making you go anywhere.

421
00:19:17,382 --> 00:19:19,627
I'm not gonna stab you
in the back or anything, so...

422
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:23,090
Maybe I should go somewhere.
Maybe I should move to Eagleton.

423
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,999
Oh, God, the thought of that.

424
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:27,711
Leslie, you don't have
to move to Eagleton.

425
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,713
When I become city manager,

426
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:31,131
my job is yours.

427
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:34,916
Of course,
my first act as city manager

428
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,941
will be to propose eliminating
the parks department,

429
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:40,515
although I expect
a spirited debate with Leslie.

430
00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:43,027
Who knows what the future
holds for me?

431
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:46,402
Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job
and become city manager.

432
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:48,955
Of course,
my first act as city manager

433
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,013
would be to double the size
of the parks department,

434
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:54,588
although I do expect
a fight from Ron.

435
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:57,405
But I'll win.

436
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:00,402
Thank you, darling.

437
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:02,954
Why would anybody ever eat anything
besides breakfast food?

438
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,483
People are idiots, Leslie.

439
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:13,020
The wait is over.

440
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,092
Look what's here.

441
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:17,844
What we got...

442
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:19,345
"My fellow Pawneeans,

443
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,144
"yes, it's here.

444
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,808
"The parks department's
summer catalog has arrived.

445
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:26,603
"And for the first time
in 20 years, tennis is back.

446
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:29,704
"Peruse this wondrous book
at your leisure

447
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,567
"and take advantage of everything
this great town has to offer.

448
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:35,756
"Time is fleeting,
my fellow pawneeans.

449
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,181
"Make the most of it while you can.

450
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:41,311
"I recently had the honor
of spending an afternoon

451
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:44,086
"with every living,
former parks director,

452
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,555
"and they taught me
a valuable lesson...

453
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,958
"There's nothing
more important than friendship."

454
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,167
- It's a little flowery.
- Shut up.

455
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:56,291
I got to hand it to Michael.

456
00:20:56,416 --> 00:21:00,306
His water-pipe-making skills
were most impressive.

457
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:03,626
I once saw him smoke pot
out of a 20-foot length of garden hose

458
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:05,105
and a milk jug.

459
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:08,346
That guy made a water pipe
out of a stuffed raccoon.

460
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:09,843
I'm not kidding.

461
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,900
He made a bong
out of a taxidermied raccoon?

462
00:21:12,115 --> 00:21:16,069
I caught him smoking pot out of it
now 3 feet from where we're standing.

463
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,306
Nice shot!

464
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,764
Right in Clarence's ancient junk.

465
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:24,929
In the neck!
