1
00:00:03,365 --> 00:00:06,284
- Can I run something by you?
- Sure. I love having things run by me.

2
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:08,800
I feel like you're being sarcastic.

3
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,756
No, no. I'm not.
I genuinely love it.

4
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,535
Run it by me.
Go ahead. Go go.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,591
So I've been worried
that Ann maybe thinks

6
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:17,307
that our relationship
isn't moving forward fast enough.

7
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:20,989
And so I'm wondering
if maybe I should ask her

8
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:23,361
if she would like to move in
with me.

9
00:00:23,486 --> 00:00:25,386
Good idea? Bad idea?
You tell me.

10
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:28,665
I would say that some women
won't consider moving in with someone

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,269
unless they think marriage
is in the future, which I know is...

12
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:32,994
I intend to marry her.

13
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:36,481
For realskies?

14
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,049
I'm not really quite sure
how I feel.

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,393
It's a little weird.
I'm happy for them. They're my friends.

16
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:44,702
I'm nauseous.

17
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:48,027
If I could just sum it up
in one word, it would be...

18
00:00:57,795 --> 00:00:59,420
- Feygnasse Team -

19
00:00:59,764 --> 00:01:01,208
La Fabrique ::.

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,042
Episode 221
94 Meetings

21
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:06,490
mpm - lestat

22
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:21,907
Parks and rec.

23
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:25,877
Confirming what?

24
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:28,885
That's not possible.

25
00:01:37,418 --> 00:01:40,586
Why are there six people outside
who say they're waiting to meet with me?

26
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:43,295
So you know how you love me
because you haven't had

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,925
a single meeting with anyone
since I became your assistant?

28
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:48,875
That's because
every time someone calls

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,596
and requests a meeting with you,

30
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:52,974
I always schedule it for march 31st.

31
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,394
- Why?
- I didn't think march 31st existed.

32
00:01:57,247 --> 00:02:00,660
30 days has September,
April, March, and November.

33
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,191
June and November.

34
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,278
Today is March 31st.

35
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:06,571
I know.

36
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:09,446
So then how many meetings
do I have today?

37
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:11,052
93.

38
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,373
- You know what to do.
- Right.

39
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,611
To me, this situation
is a blood-soaked,

40
00:02:20,736 --> 00:02:22,336
nightmarish hellscape.

41
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:24,756
However, to Leslie Knope...

42
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,339
How fun.

43
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:29,796
Why don't you take as many as you can
and I'll cover the rest?

44
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:30,887
I have an idea.

45
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:33,590
Why don't I try to rustle up
seven more meetings

46
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:36,267
'cause I think it would be cooler
if there were an even 100.

47
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:38,519
Why don't we stick to these 93
and see how it goes.

48
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,355
This is the perfect distraction.

49
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,021
So I have everything I need.

50
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:46,382
I have a fresh cup of coffee,
comfy, fur-lined boots.

51
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:48,154
I'll need them later.

52
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,187
Yeah, no problem. They're actually
a little narrow for me.

53
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:52,658
Leslie, here's a guy.

54
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:54,660
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope,
deputy director.

55
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:57,100
Bill Haggardy,
Pawnee historical society.

56
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:59,049
I'm supposed to be meeting
with Ron Swanson.

57
00:02:59,174 --> 00:03:00,833
I understand that. He's tied up.

58
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,293
I've been trying
to meet with him three months

59
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:04,925
and now he's not available.

60
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,409
It's probably too late now,
but some rich woman, Jessica Wicks,

61
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,905
has rented out Turnbill mansion
for a party

62
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,512
and she's making alterations.

63
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:14,228
"Alterations"?

64
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:17,683
Turnbill mansion is one of the most
beloved historical sites in Pawnee.

65
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:21,606
In 1867, the progressive
reverend Turnbill

66
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:24,401
officiated a wedding
between a white woman

67
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:26,882
and a Wamapoke Indian chief.

68
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:30,910
The secret ceremony
was beautiful and romantic.

69
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:35,031
But then word got out
and the reception was a bloodbath.

70
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,562
Fortunately,
there were two survivors.

71
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,417
Unfortunately,
they were both horses.

72
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:46,715
Hold up. Former beauty queen
Jessica Wicks?

73
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,258
Tom Haverford. I'm gonna
be running point on this, Bill.

74
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:53,275
- Why didn't you try to stop her?
- Her husband is Nick Newport, Sr.

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,097
From Sweetums. Everyone in this town
is afraid to say no to him.

76
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
Everybody just relax.

77
00:03:58,392 --> 00:03:59,642
What are the alterations?

78
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:03,526
Drilling holes. Painting.
Removing wainscoting.

79
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,398
She's tearing down the gazebo.

80
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,066
What? She's what?
No, she's not.

81
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:10,041
Okay, Tom, go get the car.

82
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,656
- Don't throw things at me.
- These are tight.

83
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,992
I'll devise an action plan

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,896
to help us coordinate better.

85
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:20,121
Will you? Great.
Thanks for coming in.

86
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:22,748
- Who's next?
- Tom, I'll meet you at the car.

87
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:25,169
Where are you going?
We have 91 more meetings.

88
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:27,033
Sorry.
As much as I would like to go

89
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:29,469
for the all-time, city hall
single day meetings record,

90
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:31,090
there is an emergency.

91
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:33,565
Someone is trying to alter a gazebo.

92
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,808
Sorry I can't hang out.
I have an emergency.

93
00:04:41,136 --> 00:04:43,072
I'm actually here to see Mark.

94
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:45,146
Right. Thanks for the coffee.

95
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:47,708
- That's also for Mark.
- I really need it though.

96
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,057
But next time more sugar.
Okay, thanks. Bye!

97
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:52,069
I postpone the rest?

98
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:54,428
Or I could set myself on fire
and create a diversion.

99
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:56,699
I'm gonna do all of these today.

100
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,117
Round up whoever's free.

101
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,808
I'm gonna need more Ron Swansons.

102
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:03,539
Look at that.
It's gorgeous.

103
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:06,563
What kind of monster
would want to change this?

104
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,970
Pre-zit.

105
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,525
Do you have any brown concealer
by any chance?

106
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,211
I need to look good for Jessica.

107
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,707
They may be rich,
but they can't just destroy history.

108
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:17,585
- Let's go.
- Right behind you.

109
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,690
I just need to spend a minute
on my cologne cloud.

110
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:24,442
- What is that?
- Attack by Dennis Feinstein.

111
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:27,188
When you want to attack the senses
of the lady you want to bed.

112
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:30,189
Door! Door! Door! Door!

113
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,314
Close it.

114
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,115
So basically,
we're completely swamped.

115
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,447
All hands on deck.

116
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,047
I don't even work here.

117
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,452
Don't care. I need anyone
with a pulse and a brain to pitch in.

118
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,746
Do you need help with anything?

119
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:46,582
No. We're good. Thanks.
In fact, you can head home early.

120
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:50,503
Right now the four of us
are gonna divvy up all these meetings.

121
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,397
Make 'em feel
like they've been heard.

122
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:53,959
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

123
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,184
Bert Macklin, FBI, on the case.

124
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:00,073
April, you take Leslie's office.

125
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:01,570
Andy, the conference room.

126
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,712
Ann, take your meetings
in the courtyard.

127
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:06,998
Just sit there
and don't ruin the city.

128
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:08,935
Dismissed.

129
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,586
What are you doing?

130
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:14,068
Can I get a badge?

131
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:18,280
Brought you coffee.
Help you get through the day.

132
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,740
Thanks, dude.

133
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:22,710
No problem, lady.

134
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:29,451
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

135
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:31,127
April is the best.

136
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,642
But she's 20.

137
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:35,206
When April was born,
I was already in 3rd grade.

138
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:39,066
So if we were friends back then,
I'd have been hanging out with a baby.

139
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:42,435
I don't know anything
about infant care.

140
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,932
My God, I could've killed her.

141
00:06:47,872 --> 00:06:49,372
Mr. Newport, sr.

142
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,242
I've just been informed
that you plan on altering this mansion.

143
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:54,375
And as a member
of the parks department,

144
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,547
as a Pawneean, and an American,

145
00:06:56,672 --> 00:07:00,406
I ask you to refrain
from harming this historic structure.

146
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,450
What?

147
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:05,634
- I'll take care of this, love nut.
- Biscuit.

148
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:09,999
I'm Jessica Wicks.
Miss Pawnee 1994.

149
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:13,044
We've met before. We were both judges
at the pageant last year.

150
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:16,016
Leslie Knorp.
Of course. How are you?

151
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:18,760
Jessica Wicks! Hey, boo.

152
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:21,093
Are you aging in reverse
'cause you look barely legal?

153
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:24,305
If you're not the most
charming man in Indiana.

154
00:07:24,473 --> 00:07:27,235
And this must be
the luckiest man in Indiana.

155
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,934
Sir, it is an honor to meet you.

156
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,040
Come here, you.

157
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:35,642
Tell me straight.

158
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,396
Are you a Chinese?

159
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:40,571
I'm one of the Indian people.

160
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:44,657
That floppy old bag of money
is gonna be dead in, like, a month.

161
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:48,332
And who's gonna comfort Jessica
and her millions of dollars?

162
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah, Jessica's a gold digger,
but I'm a gold digger digger.

163
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,512
So how did you and Mr. Newport meet?

164
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:59,381
Well, I was doing a ribbon
cutting at the hospital.

165
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:02,148
And he was there
because his blood doesn't work.

166
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,937
And we started talking.

167
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:06,162
And then I realized who he was.

168
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,225
Oh, my gosh.
It was love at first sight.

169
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,729
That sounds so romantic.

170
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:15,011
I know you've rented out this house
for a party,

171
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:18,164
but it's on the historical register
so we can't allow any changes.

172
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,628
I'm so sorry.

173
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,029
It's a little late for that,
sweetheart.

174
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,073
I told them
what I was doing months ago.

175
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:26,216
Where I come from there's a saying

176
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:29,203
- "what's done is done".
- That's a saying everywhere.

177
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,300
I've never heard it
it's a great saying.

178
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:34,083
Maybe we can limit the damage.
How much have you done?

179
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,657
You painted this?

180
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,818
Miami teal
is Nicky's favorite color.

181
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:42,019
We also replaced
some of the sconces,

182
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:45,121
got rid of the furniture,
painted these floors black.

183
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:47,243
These were
the original hardwood floors.

184
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:50,237
They were all scratched up.
I did you a favor.

185
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:52,309
I'll show you
what we did in the sitting room.

186
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,298
After you.
I'd hate to miss the view.

187
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:58,797
You little devil. I should just pay you
to follow me around.

188
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,878
If that's a job offer, I accept.

189
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:04,591
Why did you have to drill holes
in the wall?

190
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:06,887
To hang my birthday present
to Nicky.

191
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:09,273
My heavens.

192
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:12,334
Isn't there a way that you...
Oh, my.

193
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:15,011
History is important.

194
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,800
You can't go around
changing everything all the time

195
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,740
or else next thing you know
they'll be painting the White House...

196
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:22,612
Not white.

197
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:26,586
I'm so angry,
I can't think of another color.

198
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:28,554
Green.

199
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,739
So your department banned me
from attending games

200
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,708
just because I yell
"you suck" at the players.

201
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,360
According to the complaint,
you yelled it at five-year-old girls.

202
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:41,695
Who suck!

203
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,436
Why is that so hard to understand?

204
00:09:45,072 --> 00:09:47,367
I thought I was having
this meeting with Ron Swanson.

205
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,912
I'm afraid that Ron Swanson's
currently dead.

206
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:53,759
I'm his daughter.
April Swanson.

207
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:58,336
And it's his last wish
that I have this meeting with you.

208
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,669
I represent the ultimate
Frisbee league.

209
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:02,879
Pawnee has an ultimate league?

210
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:04,968
Yes, and we keep running
into conflicts...

211
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,469
You won me over.

212
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:07,874
I will join your team.

213
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:10,056
I'm sorry, what we need...

214
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:12,384
When does practice start?
You provide the jerseys?

215
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,119
What color are the jerseys by the way?
What's our team name?

216
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:16,537
Are we "the lightning"?

217
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,826
Now, I have to tell you, I don't work
in the parks department.

218
00:10:20,951 --> 00:10:22,751
- I'm a nurse.
- Seriously?

219
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:27,032
That's great news.
I have the weirdest thing on my arm.

220
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:29,576
Can you see?

221
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,995
Every time.

222
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,545
Well, thank God you haven't
torn down the gazebo yet.

223
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,831
Don't remind me.

224
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:39,627
The demolition people couldn't
get here until this afternoon.

225
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:42,069
I've had to look at that ugly thing
all day long.

226
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:43,628
Ugly thing?

227
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,450
Let me tell you a little something
about this ugly thing, ma'am.

228
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,573
150 years ago, an interracial couple

229
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:52,702
was married here
and slaughtered by their own families.

230
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:55,166
It's one of the most beautiful stories
in Pawnee's history.

231
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:58,808
- Why are you trying to destroy it?
- Don't tell me about Pawnee history.

232
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,463
The Newports made this town.

233
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:04,743
And tonight, we're gonna celebrate
my husband's 85th birthday

234
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:07,428
without this mushy,
old, pile of rot.

235
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:09,581
Your husband's a mushy,
old, pile of rot.

236
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:12,598
You were a stick in the mud
when we judged that beauty pageant

237
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,907
you're being a stick in the mud now!

238
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:16,687
I am not a stick in the mud!

239
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,733
I just want to stop a party
from happening.

240
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:25,703
I have a gazebo update so ignore
all my previous voicemails and emails.

241
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:28,199
Leslie, I haven't relieved myself
in five hours.

242
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:29,974
So if you'll excuse me.

243
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:33,128
I'm sorry, but this can't wait.
Jessica Wicks refuses...

244
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:34,803
Leslie, what the?

245
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,059
Councilman Howser!
Nice to see you again.

246
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:40,077
Not that I saw anything
other than your face.

247
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:42,553
And I would like to talk to you
about this gazebo thing.

248
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:45,508
- You know, the p...
- Enough of this.

249
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:48,302
Do whatever you want.
Alert the media. Call Fema.

250
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:51,615
I don't care.
Do not bother me with this again.

251
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,971
- Miss Knope.
- Councilman Howser.

252
00:11:58,276 --> 00:11:59,626
I saw your penis.

253
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,441
There are eight swings
at ramsett park

254
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:04,703
and every single one of them
is broken.

255
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,570
Can you please just fix one of them?

256
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:09,883
Ron told me I can't
say yes to anything.

257
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:12,308
But it's such a reasonable request,

258
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,870
I can't just say no.

259
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:18,315
So that's a "yes"?

260
00:12:21,253 --> 00:12:23,882
Are you saying "yes"?
Just say out loud "yes" or "no".

261
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:31,929
Yeah, they do look
a little bit swollen.

262
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:34,258
Just follow the pen.

263
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:36,809
Follow the pen t...

264
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:39,520
Does that hurt?

265
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,191
This ordinance can't go through.
Too much red tape.

266
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,886
- This gridlock drives me nuts.
- Tell me about it.

267
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:49,070
You're gonna have to make
an end run, you know?

268
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:50,906
Go right to the commissioner.

269
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:53,452
I hadn't thought of that.
That is a really great idea.

270
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:55,213
I'm gonna do that.

271
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,955
Your last resort is probably
gonna be city council.

272
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:01,206
- Good luck there.
- Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

273
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,460
I have no idea what I was saying.

274
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:04,587
I ask you,

275
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,881
is this too revealing
for a public pool?

276
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,426
Kindly get your groin off my desk.

277
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,677
So my body makes you
uncomfortable too?

278
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:17,890
I'm kind of freaking out
about this historical mansion thing.

279
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:20,603
- Can I talk to you?
- I'm actually headed right out the door.

280
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:23,105
You're going on a date with Ann?

281
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,232
I was gonna surprise her.
Take her to restaurant.

282
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,700
- Don't worry. Have a good time.
- You sure?

283
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,004
- How we doing?
- Pretty good.

284
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:34,329
I may have promised
a new aquatic center to somebody.

285
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,369
Is that a problem?

286
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:38,996
I diagnosed two melanomas.
They're both benign.

287
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,206
- How many more meetings?
- 20.

288
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,627
April was supposed to be the moat

289
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:47,463
that kept the citizen barbarians

290
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:48,983
away from Swanson castle.

291
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:52,536
Instead, she blew up the castle
and stabbed me in the face.

292
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:55,721
I hired you to do one thing.

293
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:57,766
Just one.

294
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,100
I don't care that you text all day

295
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:02,978
and sleep at your desk.
In fact, I encourage it.

296
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:06,078
But only because you were doing
that one thing...

297
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:08,692
Keeping this crap off my desk!

298
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:13,102
Give me five minutes
before the next one.

299
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,987
That guy is scary when he's angry.

300
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:22,512
Yeah, God, I know.

301
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:24,328
Hey, sorry, dude.

302
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:27,024
I don't need your sympathy.

303
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,087
Or yours.

304
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:30,632
I wasn't offering my sympathy.

305
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:35,264
- Thank you for meeting me here.
- Sure. What's up?

306
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:38,681
- I need you to get this word for word.
- It's a tape recorder so it will.

307
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,327
Gazebo?
More like "ga-zoinks-bo".

308
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,046
She may be a former beauty queen,

309
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,647
but today she's the king
of destroying history.

310
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,475
Could you talk normally?

311
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,341
Okay, fine.
Ga-zoinks-bo.

312
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:53,933
Jessica Wicks is throwing a party
for her husband, Nick Newport, sr.,

313
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:57,032
- at the Turnbill mansion tonight.
- I'm gonna stop you right there.

314
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,327
Nick Newport, Sr.
Is the former CEO of Sweetums.

315
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:01,358
So?

316
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,606
Sweetums owns the Pawnee journal.

317
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:05,181
Crap on the cob.

318
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:07,710
I will take it into consideration.

319
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:10,352
Thank God!

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,007
- That was it, right?
- No, there's one more.

321
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,133
Damn it to hell!

322
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,261
It's with me. And it's right now.
And it's about me quitting.

323
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:19,332
I quit.

324
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:23,923
I have no other choice.

325
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,301
This is the only rational way
I know to prevent this tragedy.

326
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:30,232
Here they come.
Throw away the key!

327
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,372
- Seriously?
- Yes, throw it!

328
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:36,865
- Out of the way!
- Sir, sorry, but you're a little late.

329
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,159
You're gonna have to turn around
'cause you're not getting in here.

330
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,997
My God. Tom, stop him!
Jump in front of it!

331
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:46,976
Sacrifice your tiny body!

332
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,844
I really thought that gate
would open in the middle.

333
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:02,112
The gazebo has been destroyed.

334
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:04,837
And the thing that bothers me
the most...

335
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:08,287
- Cut it out, Tom.
- It never gets old!

336
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:11,970
Ann and Mark are coming!

337
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:14,270
Guys, not so close.
You're gonna...

338
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:16,145
Don't go past the sensor!

339
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:19,006
Sensor.

340
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:22,217
- Sorry if I ruined your evening.
- It's totally fine.

341
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:23,427
I chained myself.

342
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:25,137
- I can see that.
- Are you okay?

343
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,205
Nothing's bruised but my ego

344
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:30,225
and my arm a little
from the mechanized gate.

345
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:32,784
Thanks again for letting me
take those meetings.

346
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,939
I've never really had a meeting before.
They're awesome.

347
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:38,293
- You're welcome.
- Have you seen April around?

348
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:39,988
She comes by at the end of the day.

349
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:41,771
You might want to check her house.

350
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:42,905
She quit on me.

351
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,531
What? Why?

352
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,538
She screwed up my entire life today.

353
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:50,370
That was one mistake.
She's perfect for you.

354
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:53,920
There's no one in the world
who's gonna do a better job for you.

355
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,612
Either you hire her back or I quit.

356
00:16:57,737 --> 00:17:00,469
- You don't work for me.
- And I never will, sir.

357
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:02,453
Good day.

358
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,007
So what'd you guys
talk about at dinner?

359
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:12,189
Was it fun?
Any big decisions arrived at?

360
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,900
- It was fine.
- Do you need a ride home?

361
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,903
No, Tom's gonna take me.
You guys go on ahead.

362
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,699
I'm glad you're okay.
Call me.

363
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,758
Well, hello there.
You must be Ron Swanson.

364
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,582
Welcome to castle Ludgate!

365
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:33,293
- Hello, Mr. Ludgate.
- Call me Larry.

366
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:35,962
- Larry, who is it?
- It's zuzu's boss.

367
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,940
Rita Ludgate.

368
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,030
You have no idea
how nice it is to meet you.

369
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:46,347
Come in, for gosh sake.
What can I get you to drink?

370
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,172
Could you take
your shoes off, please?

371
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:50,435
Thank you so much.

372
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:53,939
Nothing to drink.
Thanks.

373
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,768
Is April around?

374
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,449
Zuzu, you have a guest!

375
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:02,286
I'll fetch her.
She's probably on the internet again.

376
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:04,236
I'll come with you.

377
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,501
You make yourself at home.

378
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,416
You must be April's sister.

379
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:15,662
I'm Ron.

380
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:22,634
Nice to meet you.

381
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:25,845
No offense, but I think
the normal grieving time

382
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,614
for gazebo destruction has passed.

383
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,602
Well, maybe that's not entirely
what I'm upset about.

384
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:36,690
Mark and Ann are gonna get married.

385
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:38,003
Really?

386
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:42,071
Why does that bother you?
I should be the one that's upset.

387
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:45,189
It was supposed to be me and Ann,
or me and Jessica,

388
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:47,664
or Ann and Jessica with me watching.

389
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:52,530
Every time a couple gets married,
two single people die.

390
00:18:53,726 --> 00:18:55,644
I'm about to lose two good friends.

391
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:56,626
Come on.

392
00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:00,346
They drove over here
and cut you down from a gate.

393
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:04,384
You don't have to worry about them
abandoning you once you get married.

394
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:06,761
Yeah, I know that.
In my brain.

395
00:19:07,468 --> 00:19:10,432
- Can we go?
- I just need to go do one more thing.

396
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,057
Loving smiles

397
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,609
And smiling tears

398
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:24,789
The midnight of my heart

399
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,064
- Is you
- Okay, I'm sorry, everyone.

400
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:30,993
Excuse me. Excuse me.
But I need to say something.

401
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:33,603
Is that gate lady?

402
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:35,359
I know you're probably thinking

403
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:37,855
"There's that crazy gate lady
from outside back again."

404
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,606
And to some extent, you're right.
I am the gate lady.

405
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:43,506
But the only thing I'm crazy about
is leaving the past behind.

406
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:47,453
So I would like to apologize
and raise a glass

407
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,806
to change, and forgiveness,
and the future,

408
00:19:51,974 --> 00:19:54,184
and Ann and Mark, and happiness,

409
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:55,902
and Nick Newport, Sr.

410
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,272
May all your future gazebos
live long and prosper.

411
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:00,972
Please leave.

412
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:04,438
Is it weird if I ask
to take a piece of cake with me?

413
00:20:04,563 --> 00:20:05,813
- I won't.
- Go.

414
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:09,035
Why are you here?

415
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:11,638
Come back to work.

416
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,620
Come back.

417
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,290
I want you to come back.

418
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,729
Well, I don't want to come back.

419
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:22,962
- The end.
- I was talking to Andy about you.

420
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:26,716
And he made me realize
that I need you back at work.

421
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:29,052
- What did he say?
- Don't recall.

422
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,429
- Fine. I'll come back.
- Good.

423
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,699
I'm leaving.

424
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:37,182
Bye, Zuzu.

425
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,688
Bye, Duke Silver.

426
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:46,224
My mom has all your albums.

427
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,321
I recognized you the day we met.

428
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:50,448
Have you told anyone?

429
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,319
Good girl.

430
00:20:58,198 --> 00:20:59,196
Excuse me.

431
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,443
I had a meeting
with Ron Swanson yesterday,

432
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:04,874
- but I have a little car trouble.
- Sorry, he's busy right now.

433
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,658
- Well, can I reschedule?
- Sure.

434
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,860
How about June 50th?

435
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:15,046
Do you think you could
come back today at 2:65?

436
00:21:15,171 --> 00:21:17,584
- He's available then.
- What is going on?

437
00:21:18,002 --> 00:21:20,695
The only other day he has open
is march-tember one-teenth.

438
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,230
Does that work, sir?

439
