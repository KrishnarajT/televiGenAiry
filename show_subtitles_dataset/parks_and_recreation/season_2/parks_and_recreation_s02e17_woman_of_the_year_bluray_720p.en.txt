1
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:04,496
- I was here first. Get lost.
- We were here first.

2
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,302
But we're scheduled for this time.

3
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:08,864
This is no way for adults
to act in front of children.

4
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:10,973
You're not only coaches,
you're role models.

5
00:00:11,827 --> 00:00:13,726
I would hardly call
what he does coaching.

6
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:19,523
Excellent role modeling.

7
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,919
The girls' team does not have a field
assigned to them for practice,

8
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,545
but the boys' team does.

9
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:26,844
Not on my watch.

10
00:00:27,273 --> 00:00:30,576
Every child has the right to play,
no matter how boring the sport.

11
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,205
Could you just share the field
with the girls today, please?

12
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,999
I'm the girls' coach.
She's the boys' coach.

13
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:39,084
- Sorry.
- That's sexist.

14
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:41,126
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, it kind of is.

15
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:43,435
Why don't the boys
take the field today

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,674
and then I will make sure
that the girls

17
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:47,927
get a place to practice
by the end of the week?

18
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:49,637
And that, little lady,

19
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:52,389
- is a Leslie Knope promise.
- I'm a boy.

20
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:54,850
Good, 'cause I was talking to you.

21
00:00:55,018 --> 00:00:56,393
You're a girl, right?

22
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,224
She.

23
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,518
- Feygnasse Team -

24
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,273
La Fabrique ::.

25
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:05,149
Episode 217
Woman of the year

26
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:07,553
mpm

27
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:09,281
lestat78

28
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:20,416
Mail's here.

29
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:26,465
You got soup all over our mail.
You jerk.

30
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:29,610
My God. It's an envelope
from the I.O.W. awards office.

31
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:31,085
Nobody freak out.

32
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,907
Do you know what this means?

33
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:36,657
I am Pawnee's woman of the year.

34
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:39,937
The I.O.W.
is the Indiana Organization of Women.

35
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:42,807
I have been a dues-paying member
since I was nine.

36
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,895
And every year,
they choose one woman to win

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,644
the Dorothy Everton Smythe
female empowerment award.

38
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,769
Winning is every girl's dream.

39
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:51,453
But it's my destiny.

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,325
And my dream.

41
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,954
Can you read it, please?
Where my ladies at?

42
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,317
Here we go.

43
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:02,918
The I.O.W. is proud to announce
this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe

44
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:05,714
female empowerment award winner:

45
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:07,172
Ronald Swanson.

46
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,883
- Pretty funny.
- It says Ronald Swanson.

47
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:11,481
What?
No, it doesn't.

48
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:12,854
I... That... No.

49
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,282
They only honor women,
and Ron's the opposite of a woman.

50
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:19,560
What's going on?

51
00:02:19,728 --> 00:02:22,486
You're Pawnee's woman of the year,
it looks like.

52
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,811
Well, it's about time.

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,945
They've obviously made a mistake.

54
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:31,196
Bully for me.

55
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,070
Congratulations, Ron.

56
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:35,576
- It's very exciting.
- It's awesome.

57
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,155
Awards are stupid.

58
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:40,929
Which is why I fully intend
to decline this nonsense

59
00:02:41,054 --> 00:02:42,931
and recommend it go to Leslie.

60
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:45,706
Because she works really hard
and I don't.

61
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:48,088
However,

62
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:51,417
she cares way too much
about crap like this,

63
00:02:51,542 --> 00:02:55,532
which is why I can't pass up
this opportunity to tease her about it.

64
00:02:56,971 --> 00:02:58,682
We can't stand around all day

65
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,152
congratulating me
on receiving an award

66
00:03:01,277 --> 00:03:03,397
from some lousy
women's organization.

67
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:05,172
Back to work, everyone.

68
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,488
Hey, Freddy.

69
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,009
Good news.

70
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:17,271
Your liquor license renewal got go.

71
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:19,685
What do you mean by that?

72
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,299
I got you temporary approval
from the liquor board

73
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:25,005
pending full-board authorization
and council review.

74
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:26,469
Got got.

75
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,878
Thank you so much.

76
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:30,964
No worries. You know the Snakehole's
my favorite Pawnee hot spot.

77
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:34,848
I wanna open up my own club one day.
Maybe call it like Club-a-dub-dub

78
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,373
or the Clubmarine,

79
00:03:36,786 --> 00:03:38,886
sort of a submarine-themed club.

80
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:41,328
Or Tom's bistro.

81
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:43,477
The word bistro is classy as ***.

82
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,896
We are looking for

83
00:03:46,064 --> 00:03:48,607
a few top quality guys like yourself

84
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,510
to become part owners.

85
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:54,321
With your political connections,
I think you'd make a great asset.

86
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:57,324
I agree. That's why I got
into public service, to help me.

87
00:03:57,492 --> 00:03:59,392
All right.
$10,000 a share.

88
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:01,120
Need the money by Friday.

89
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,498
$10,000.
That's chump change.

90
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:07,956
I will see you Friday with...

91
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:10,879
- $10,000.
- All right, partner.

92
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:16,593
I just don't get why the I.O.W.
would give that award to Ron.

93
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:18,887
- That's a bummer.
- One, he's not a woman.

94
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:20,055
And two,

95
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:22,710
they mention the Camp Athena project
in that letter.

96
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:25,706
That's my project. I started that.
It was my brainchild.

97
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:28,272
Why would Ron
start a camp for troubled girls?

98
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:30,024
- He wouldn't.
- Exactly.

99
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:32,549
I deserve that award.
That award is mine, not his.

100
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:33,569
It's mine.

101
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:35,946
- You should do...
- I know, I started a list.

102
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:37,748
"Write an email to Barack Obama.

103
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:40,346
"Lock myself in my office
and scream until I lose my voice."

104
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,680
That's all I have.

105
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:43,787
I was gonna suggest,
you go and talk to him.

106
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:47,082
You're only gonna get more resentful
if you don't.

107
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:54,097
I have so much
I need to tell you right now.

108
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:57,529
Leslie would like to talk to you
for a moment, is that all right?

109
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:58,479
Good.

110
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,721
Jean-Ralphio.

111
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:03,891
Big T, what it do, nephew?

112
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,382
I have a hot investment opportunity
that you are gonna wanna jump all over.

113
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:12,505
Hit me with it.

114
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,564
- The Snakehole lounge...
- Heard of it.

115
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,998
- Is looking for investors.
- No way.

116
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,521
Yesterday I would have said no,
but thank God my grandfather died

117
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:24,292
so I am Fluh-ush with cah-ash

118
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,121
Awesome.

119
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:29,625
I have 4,000 bucks.
All I need you to do is kick in 6gs

120
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:33,783
and then you and I are part owners
of the hottest nightclub in Pawnee.

121
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,464
Also, sorry about your grandpa.

122
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:37,834
No worries, he was a dick.
Here's the thing.

123
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,881
I can kick in 5gs.
That should be enough, right?

124
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,269
No, it's not enough.
I just said I need 6gs.

125
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,397
- Your trust fund?
- My parents had it amended.

126
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:46,624
Nothing 'til I'm 50,

127
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:49,945
which is a waste, 'cause I'll be
a billionaire in Costa Rica by then,

128
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,489
eating dolphins and hanging out
with lady singers.

129
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:54,233
It's not a huge deal.
Sit tight.

130
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:56,985
- I'll take care of it.
- You wanna come home with me?

131
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,311
Don't you work at Lady Foot Locker?

132
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:01,615
Look, if you're not gonna pay rent,

133
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:03,726
at least clean up your dishes.

134
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,592
Is that all?

135
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:10,662
Also, the bag of smells was fun,
but it has to stop.

136
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:14,407
Come on. Now... No, we're finally
starting to get serious results.

137
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:16,547
Andy, dude, I love you.

138
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:18,090
But shape up or move out.

139
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,728
- What's going on?
- My guitarist is driving me crazy.

140
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:25,525
He's such a control freak.

141
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,947
That's not a working fireplace.

142
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:29,945
Stop writing phone messages
on the wall, Andy.

143
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,897
Dude, seriously, I love you, but stop
digging that weird hole in the backyard.

144
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,497
Is Mouse Rat gonna break up?

145
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:38,485
We're not Mouse Rat anymore.
We changed it to Tackleshaft.

146
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:42,197
- I should just get my own place.
- You should.

147
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:44,700
- I'll help you.
- You could help me?

148
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,261
Yeah, that'd be fun.

149
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,912
You're like an angel with no wings.

150
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,539
So like a person.

151
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,130
- What's in the envelope?
- Nothing.

152
00:06:57,826 --> 00:07:01,206
- You wanted to see me?
- I think the Pawnee chapter of the IOW

153
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:02,980
has a made a little mistake.

154
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:04,887
Really?

155
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:07,725
You're saying a women's organization
made a mistake?

156
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,443
I was as surprised as you were.

157
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:12,686
But the fact is,
they only give that award to women.

158
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:16,440
Well, it definitely said
Ron Swanson in the letter.

159
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:18,740
Yeah, but it also mentioned
my camp project.

160
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:20,315
Ah, yes, camp Xena.

161
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,904
Athena. Camp athena.

162
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:25,167
- You don't even know the name.
- I almost got it. It was pretty close.

163
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,283
Look, Leslie.

164
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:30,078
Your job, which you're great at,
is making me look good.

165
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:32,398
Which you've clearly done well

166
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:34,532
because I'm getting an award.

167
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:35,709
Right?

168
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,081
Be proud of yourself.
I mean, you deserve an award.

169
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:43,014
Not this one, obviously.
This one belongs to me.

170
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,575
But some other one.

171
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,178
Some other lesser award.

172
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,170
And if the shoe were on the other foot
and you won,

173
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:51,516
I would have congratulated you.

174
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,058
Congratulations.

175
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,233
- What's that?
- You heard me.

176
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,360
You promised the girls a field
by the end of this week.

177
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:05,197
Well, it's a man's world,
winston, get used to it.

178
00:08:05,604 --> 00:08:06,573
I'm a man.

179
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,698
You know who you should talk to?
Ron Swanson.

180
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:14,252
He's an award winning public servant.
He's the guy that's gonna help you out.

181
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:15,715
Go on in there.

182
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,913
'Scuse me.
Ron, someone's coming in.

183
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,201
Leslie said I should come over here.

184
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:26,117
If you don't get credit for your work,
why bother doing it?

185
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,907
Because I love it.

186
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,605
But I'm gonna make a point.

187
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,310
This VIP card gives you
exclusive access

188
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:38,021
to the investment opportunity
of a lifetime.

189
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:41,084
Where?
Multipurpose room F.

190
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,732
When?
3:00 p.m.

191
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:45,618
Dress code?
Black tie optional.

192
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,201
Just like life.

193
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,609
Hey, you want to see me?

194
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,495
Yes, yes, just hang on one second.

195
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,958
I'm doing my official portrait
for the I.U.D. awards dinner program.

196
00:08:58,307 --> 00:08:59,167
I.O.W.

197
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:02,923
No, this portrait
is not official in any way.

198
00:09:03,048 --> 00:09:04,631
I'm paying for it myself.

199
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,351
Did you need me?

200
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,913
Because some of us
actually do work around here.

201
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:12,188
Work that often goes unrewarded.

202
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:14,471
I need your opinion.

203
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,801
Which of these objects
most represents women for this portrait?

204
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:20,480
A pot?

205
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:24,804
Or this deputy director Barbie?

206
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:29,819
Isn't it adorable? She's got
a little briefcase, her cell phone...

207
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,440
I'm going to help my boss
win an award.

208
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:35,934
How's the scheduling conflict
with the soccer teams going?

209
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,445
- Take care of that, did you?
- Nope. Passed the buck to Donna.

210
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,487
That's not really the attitude
I expect from an award winner.

211
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:45,275
Everything I do is the attitude
of an award winner

212
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,158
because I've won an award.

213
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,221
So what kind of place
are you looking for?

214
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:53,347
I can afford, like,
300 bucks a month.

215
00:09:53,781 --> 00:09:55,840
I've always wanted
a doorman named Ernie.

216
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,337
That would be awesome. Or Kipp.
I'm pretty flexible on that.

217
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,585
Here's a great one.

218
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,457
It's a Tudor mansion,
it's got seven rooms,

219
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,201
four bathrooms,
it's got a tennis court,

220
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,277
a pool, and a three-car garage.

221
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:08,258
What?

222
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,253
And it's only $20,000 a month.
And it's in Chicago.

223
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:15,369
That close.
It was almost perfect.

224
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:18,121
Actually, there are
a couple cool places in here.

225
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:19,831
- Let's go look at them.
- Now?

226
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,166
- Let's roll.
- Okay.

227
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:31,659
Thank you all so much
for joining me today.

228
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,678
I have two questions for you.

229
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,399
One: are you ready for the investment
opportunity of a lifetime?

230
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,727
Two: do any of you have pacemakers
or a history of epilepsy?

231
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:41,812
Yes, both.

232
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,104
- Anybody, no? Right.
- Both.

233
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:49,737
Ladies.

234
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,790
Jay-z. Rihanna.
Audrina Patridge.

235
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:59,538
Jon Gosselin. Lady Gaga.
Snooki.

236
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,608
Are these real people?

237
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,933
Cash Warren.
And Dennis Rodman.

238
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,663
These are few the celebrities

239
00:11:06,788 --> 00:11:09,658
that wish they could invest
in Pawnee's hottest club.

240
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:11,758
But they can't!

241
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,038
And you can for the small price
of only $1,000.

242
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,750
The only question is,
who's gonna be my partner?

243
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,147
Mark, I'm talking to you.

244
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,606
Donna, I'm talking to you.

245
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:29,734
Jerry, I'm talking to you.
Mark, I'm talking to you.

246
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:34,531
26 certificates, plaques,
ribbons, trophies,

247
00:11:35,038 --> 00:11:36,366
medals, and miscellany

248
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:39,956
certifying that I deserve recognition
for my achievements.

249
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:41,920
What do you have, Ron?

250
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:45,539
I have the Dorothy everytime
smurf girl trophy

251
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,502
for excellence in female stuff.

252
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,754
Dorothy Everton Smythe.
I swear to God...

253
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:52,656
Before you continue,

254
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,259
please read this.

255
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:57,457
Another organization giving you credit
for something you didn't do?

256
00:12:00,703 --> 00:12:03,194
"I, Ron Swanson, recognize that...

257
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:07,130
"Leslie Knope should have received
the I.O.W. Award

258
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:10,901
"for all the hard work she has done,
especially for the camp Athena project.

259
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,111
"However, in my opinion,

260
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,059
"she is far too concerned
with institutional gratification."

261
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:18,284
No, I'm not.

262
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,254
"So I'm gonna let her dangle

263
00:12:21,737 --> 00:12:24,918
"in order to show her
that awards are bull..."

264
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:28,487
Come on, Leslie,
you know I'm not sexist.

265
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,086
I love powerful women.

266
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:32,756
Well, you do attend
a shocking number of WNBA games.

267
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:36,021
I'm just saying
that awards are political.

268
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,046
And everybody has an agenda.

269
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:41,139
If you spend your life chasing them,
you'll drive yourself nuts.

270
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:42,387
Yeah, all right.

271
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,566
But Dorothy Everton Smythe
was a trailblazing feminist.

272
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,626
She was the first woman in Pawnee
to wear pants on a Sunday.

273
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,398
She spent 4 years in jail for that.

274
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:52,776
I know I'm not supposed to care
about these things,

275
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,487
but this one means a lot.

276
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,974
I know you've been changing

277
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:03,540
The acoustics in the bathroom
are insane.

278
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:05,956
So, how much is this one again?

279
00:13:06,473 --> 00:13:08,625
This one is $425 a month
plus utilities.

280
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:12,402
I like it.
It seems to have...

281
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:14,902
a lot of potential and...

282
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:18,093
a lot of advantages, per se.

283
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:22,097
Could definitely picture myself
doing something over there.

284
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,934
You hear that?

285
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,216
What is that?

286
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,523
- It's still on.
- Light a match to get rid of the smell.

287
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:33,721
I feel really good about this.

288
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,805
- Really?
- It screams Andy Dwyer.

289
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:39,651
And I live nearby, so we could, like,
carpool to work or something.

290
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:41,074
Are you serious?

291
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:42,951
The scream just got louder.

292
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:46,705
- So what do you think?
- I don't know, make me an offer.

293
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:50,590
Okay.
First come, first served.

294
00:13:50,715 --> 00:13:52,002
Who's in? Jerry.

295
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:53,959
Geez, Tom.

296
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,423
If I spend any more than 25 bucks,
I gotta ask my wife.

297
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:57,893
Jerry, get out.

298
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:01,160
Mark, what are we doing tonight?

299
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,883
I don't know, Ann.

300
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,943
We could do the usual boring stuff

301
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,189
like eat some chicken salad
with some crackers

302
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,863
or watch the pay-per-view.
Or...

303
00:14:10,622 --> 00:14:12,439
We could go to my nightclub

304
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:13,928
and do some dancin'.

305
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,275
I don't think so, man.

306
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:17,360
You'd never have to beg
for sex again.

307
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:19,785
I don't wanna get into this, really,

308
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,656
but I don't beg for sex now.

309
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,700
Forget about that.
Are you in or out?

310
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:25,744
Just not really my thing.

311
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:27,245
Bye, Mark.

312
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
Cindy.

313
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:33,793
Maybe. I like the Snakehole.

314
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:38,211
Plus, I would look good pulling into
my owner's parking space in my Mercedes.

315
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,760
To be clear,
you wouldn't be an owner per se.

316
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:44,183
You, me, and my boy Jean-Ralphio
would each own part of a share.

317
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,848
- Will that be cash or check?
- Not so fast.

318
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,643
I need to know who I'm in business with.
I wanna meet your boy.

319
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,063
Come here.
This lady's here.

320
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:56,649
Hi. I'm Elise Yarktin.
I'm with the I.O.W.

321
00:14:56,877 --> 00:14:59,652
I'm... woman of the year,
Ron Swanson.

322
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,729
Yes, I know.

323
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:03,657
We are very excited to be presenting you
with the Smythe award.

324
00:15:04,138 --> 00:15:05,596
That's what I want to talk about.

325
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,453
I don't know if I can take
all the excitement.

326
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,827
So I think the award
should go to Miss Knope here.

327
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,582
She's the one
who really deserves it.

328
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:17,337
Camp Athena was her idea,
she did all the work.

329
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,887
You made a mistake.

330
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,763
We didn't make a mistake.

331
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:24,867
We made a very conscious
decision this year to choose a man.

332
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:26,218
Why?

333
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,930
Every year we give it to a woman,
and frankly nobody cares.

334
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:33,978
The media has all but written us off
as a niche interest group.

335
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:37,248
But if you give a woman's award

336
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:41,027
to a mustachioed,
masculine man such as yourself,

337
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:43,321
well, then,
eventually people take notice.

338
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:46,616
- I don't want the damn thing.
- Well, we're giving it to you.

339
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:48,730
So you're gonna take it.

340
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,120
Like a man.

341
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,910
So congratulations.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,640
The I.O.W. is
a bunch of sexist jerks

343
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,858
who need to get back
in the kitchen where they belong

344
00:15:57,983 --> 00:16:00,358
and leave the real feminist
work to actual feminists

345
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:01,876
like Ron Swanson!

346
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,870
Oh, my God, what is happening?

347
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:07,755
Now do you see
how silly these things are?

348
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,348
- Unbelievable.
- Obviously, I'm just gonna decline it.

349
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:11,422
No, accept it.

350
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:14,227
I want you to go to the podium
and talk about how stupid awards are.

351
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,303
And how they're superficial
and meaningless.

352
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:18,815
I want you to rip awards
a new a-hole.

353
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:20,921
Now we're talking.
I'll tell you what.

354
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,981
You write the speech,
don't pull your punches.

355
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:26,448
I won't. I'm gonna push my punches.
As far as my fist can extend.

356
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:27,538
Atta girl.

357
00:16:28,097 --> 00:16:29,097
Kind of.

358
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,190
What up, big T?
Stop.

359
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:34,961
This must be the lovely Donna.

360
00:16:35,086 --> 00:16:36,086
Enchanté.

361
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:39,548
Listen, beautiful,
let's cut the bull. Right?

362
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:40,942
Right? You want this.

363
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:43,627
I definitely want this.
T.H. wants this.

364
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,130
Let's seal this devil's threeway
right here, right now.

365
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:49,179
Step one: we buy into this club.

366
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:51,060
Step 2: we roll over to the club,

367
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:53,933
either in your Mercedes-Benz
or my pre-owned Acura legend.

368
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,798
Step 3: I dagger you
on the dance floor,

369
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:58,487
just bounce, bounce, bounce.

370
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,691
And now all the ladies say
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

371
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,235
- What do you say, sexy?
- I'm out.

372
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,714
- Why?
- I hate that guy.

373
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,144
Hi, welcome to the I.O.W. Awards,

374
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:16,319
and congratulations on winning.

375
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:20,043
Well, here is your awards packet,

376
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,116
and if you will just follow me,

377
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,130
we're gonna have
a little meet and greet.

378
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:29,266
No, I'm sorry,
this area is for award winners only.

379
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:30,804
Get over yourself, Elise.

380
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:34,337
Work on the speech.
Let's nail these women.

381
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:36,643
You know what I mean.

382
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:39,729
I don't know. What's it all about?
What's the secret?

383
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:43,768
Why is it so hard to become a mogul?

384
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:46,513
All I want in life is to own a nightclub
on every continent.

385
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:49,634
Have my own line of upscale sweat suits
and a cologne called Tommy fresh.

386
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:51,458
And I fell $1,000 short.

387
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:54,014
Seriously?
That's all you needed?

388
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:55,995
I have $1,000. You can have it.

389
00:17:56,498 --> 00:17:59,207
- Thanks, but I can't take your money.
- I'm a singer-songwriter.

390
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:01,835
The two lines I put
into every song I've ever sang,

391
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:05,296
"Spread your wings and fly"
and "You deserve to be a champion".

392
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,892
You're telling me that all you need
is $1,000 to do your dreams?

393
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,136
Then I want you to have it.

394
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,296
Are you sure about this?

395
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:19,004
- Maybe.
- You know how happy you just made me?

396
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:22,144
He's the director of the Pawnee

397
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,107
Parks and Recreation department.

398
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:25,827
He is also the recipient

399
00:18:25,952 --> 00:18:29,923
of this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe
female empowerment award.

400
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:32,657
Please put your hands together
for Mr. Ron Swanson.

401
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:49,758
Every award from the smallest trophy

402
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,375
to the Nobel prize

403
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,622
is nothing more than...

404
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,272
Is nothing more than a great way
to honor someone.

405
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:06,825
So I would like to present
this year's

406
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,408
Dottie English whatever award

407
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,948
to the person
who actually deserves it.

408
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,863
Leslie Knope.
Come on up here, Leslie.

409
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:23,671
I don't know what to say.

410
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,685
Honestly, I'm just very honored

411
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:30,287
to work for someone
as insightful and kind as my boss.

412
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,341
So I would like to present
this year's

413
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,366
Dorothy Everton Smythe award

414
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:37,963
to Ron Swanson.

415
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,964
I don't want it.
Just take the damn thing.

416
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,313
- You deserve it.
- No.

417
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:47,607
- You deserve it.
- Really, but I don't want it.

418
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:51,235
- But you won it, and you should win it.
- After that whole conversation...

419
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:53,687
- Could someone please just take it?
- Okay, I'll take it.

420
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,808
Who do I speak to
about getting this changed?

421
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:57,333
Get off the stage.

422
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,676
I still think awards are stupid.

423
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,774
But they'd be less stupid
if they went to the right people.

424
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:12,905
- You gave Tom all your money?
- Yeah. Well, I'm investing.

425
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,780
I'm like Warren "Buffay".

426
00:20:15,526 --> 00:20:18,221
I feel like it would have been
good for you to have your own place.

427
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:19,622
Yeah, I know.

428
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,264
But I feel like Tom
really needed the money.

429
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,146
And small sacrifice to see one
of your best friend's dreams come true.

430
00:20:31,837 --> 00:20:34,404
- They cropped you out.
- Figures.

431
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:36,618
So where are you gonna put it?

432
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:38,074
I have an idea.

433
00:20:57,854 --> 00:20:58,678
What's up?

434
00:20:58,846 --> 00:21:00,642
Hey, guys.
How long did you wait in line?

435
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,348
I didn't wait. I'm a part owner.

436
00:21:02,825 --> 00:21:04,472
Freddy. I'm back.

437
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:07,311
Tom Haverford, part owner.
Let me know if you need anything.

438
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,689
Keep this booth warm for me
every night.

439
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,015
I'm gonna live in this booth.

440
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:15,034
Yes, sir.

441
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,078
- What are you doing here?
- I bought three shares.

442
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:23,851
Thanks for the tip.
