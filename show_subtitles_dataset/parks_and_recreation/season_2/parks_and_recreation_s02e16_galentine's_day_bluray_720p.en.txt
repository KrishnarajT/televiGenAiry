1
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:04,756
If you look inside your bags,
you'll find a few things.

2
00:00:05,097 --> 00:00:08,260
A bouquet of handcrochet
flower pens...

3
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:12,097
A mosaic portrait of each of you

4
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:14,809
made from the crush bottles
of your favorite diet soda,

5
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:17,184
and a personalized 5,000-word essay

6
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:20,021
of why you're all so awesome.

7
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:21,723
What's Galentine's day?

8
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:24,067
It's only the best day of the year.

9
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:25,652
Every february 13th,

10
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,739
my lady friends and I leave our husbands
and our boyfriends at home,

11
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:31,116
and we just come and kick it,
breakfast-style.

12
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:33,001
Ladies celebrating ladies.

13
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:36,098
It's like Lilith fair,
minus the angst.

14
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:37,971
Plus frittatas.

15
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:41,042
So to conclude our
Galentine's day breakfast,

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,421
it is time
for the greatest story ever told.

17
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:47,215
What's the story?

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,467
It's the most romantic story ever.

19
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:52,770
It makes The Notebook
look like Saw V.

20
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,587
Go, mom, go.

21
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,280
It was 1968.

22
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:59,895
I was 18, and our family
went on a vacation to Bermuda.

23
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,606
And on the first day,
I went for a swim

24
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:03,924
in the ocean,

25
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:08,654
and I got caught
in a very strong current.

26
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:12,313
- You've heard this story before, right?
- Yes, but the drama.

27
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,833
The next thing I felt

28
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:18,497
were two very powerful arms

29
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:20,916
whisking me to safety.

30
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,043
And he looked down at me,
and he said,

31
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:26,588
"Are you okay?"

32
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:29,049
and I looked up at him, and I said,

33
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:30,397
"I am now."

34
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,648
So they sneak out to meet each other
and walk on the beach,

35
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,929
and, two weeks later,
he asked her to marry him

36
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:38,604
and move to Illinois.

37
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,520
But her parents thought
she was too young, so she said no.

38
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,564
And then they lost touch,
and, a few years later, she met my dad.

39
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:48,018
I got to take lifeguard courses.
Those guys get all the action.

40
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,055
- Am I right, Justin?
- We got to find this guy.

41
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,447
Frank?
He's probably married. Or dead.

42
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,908
What's the difference?
Am I right, Justin?

43
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,887
At least let me try and find him.

44
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,348
Imagine how much better
that story would be

45
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:00,914
if we actually reunited them.

46
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,931
I think Justin's right.
You should let him do this.

47
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:06,156
Okay. Do it.

48
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:08,002
But if you find him and he's weird,

49
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,856
like a ventriloquist or a puppeteer

50
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:12,431
or anyone who pretends toys
are people,

51
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:13,927
then abort the mission.

52
00:02:14,095 --> 00:02:15,145
Absolutely.

59
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,579
You.
You're the best girlfriend ever.

60
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:43,495
Happy valentine's day.

61
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,561
I knew, eventually, somehow,

62
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:48,044
being in a relationship with you
would totally pay off.

63
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,464
I bought him some actual towels.

64
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:52,182
He was using a bathrobe.

65
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:55,036
And I bought him some other things
that humans usually use,

66
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:56,311
like shampoo.

67
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,965
Troops, gather around.
Great news.

68
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,601
The senior center valentine's dance
is tomorrow from 5:00 to 9:00.

69
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,437
Are we talking a.m. or p.m.?

70
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:07,162
Those people are old!
Am I right, Justin?

71
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,775
Justin's not here.

72
00:03:09,943 --> 00:03:12,944
It isn't just a job, gang.
We'll learn a lot from these seniors.

73
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:16,812
Some of them
have been married for half a century.

74
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:20,160
And, no offense, but everybody here
is terrible at love.

75
00:03:20,328 --> 00:03:21,328
Divorced,

76
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:22,954
dating a gay guy,

77
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,437
divorced twice,

78
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,574
jury's still out on you two.

79
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:28,277
And, Jerry, who knows?

80
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:32,255
I've been happily married for 28 years.
You've met my wife Gayle many times.

81
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:35,717
Whatever. Finally, Ann and
Mark are our special volunteers,

82
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:38,178
and they will be available
whenever needed.

83
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:39,721
I didn't volunteer.

84
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,348
Yeah, too bad. You got drafted.

85
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:45,475
Ask not what
your old people could do for you.

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,729
Ask what you could do
for your old people.

87
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:50,732
- Terminator.
- What? No. JFK.

88
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,708
This meeting has been terminated.

89
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,211
That is the Terminator.

90
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,336
Nice.

91
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:58,799
Where am I going?

92
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,173
- Well, hello there.
- Well, hey. I got your message.

93
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:05,747
You wanted to talk?

94
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:07,078
Yes, I do.

95
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:09,702
Have a seat.

96
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:14,089
- Some champagne?
- No, thanks.

97
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:16,633
Come on. This is Armand de Brignac.

98
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:20,053
- Jay-z drinks this.
- He doesn't have to perform surgery.

99
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:22,389
You don't know Jay-z's schedule.
He's a renaissance man.

100
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:24,766
Okay, fine.

101
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,351
This is for you.

102
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:29,429
It's almost valentine's day,

103
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:32,399
so I thought it would be
a good day to tell you...

104
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,319
Let me just stop you right there.

105
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,580
Look...

106
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,911
I just want you to know
I'm so grateful

107
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,073
for everything you did for me.

108
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:50,500
- But I only see us as friends.
- For now.

109
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:54,034
But think about how much better
our friendship would be

110
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,172
if we added doing it.

111
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,694
Seriously. I know our marriage was fake,
but there's something between us,

112
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,738
and we should give it
a shot for real.

113
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:07,517
I just don't feel
that way about you.

114
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,341
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,253
So there's that one, I guess.

116
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:37,380
You sound ready
for the dance tomorrow.

117
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:39,549
I don't know
about these old fogey songs, Leslie.

118
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:43,330
Why can't we just do our originals?
I just wrote a new song, okay.

119
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:45,507
Bottom line: it's called sex hair.

120
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:47,828
It's about how youknow
when someone's just had sex

121
00:05:47,953 --> 00:05:51,559
'cause of how their hair gets
matted up in the back. It's awesome.

122
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:52,935
Think of it this way.

123
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,264
These song are exactly like
the songs you usually play,

124
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,278
except instead of modern rock,
they're jazzy standards from the '40s.

125
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,826
- You got a point.
- Yeah. You're gonna do great.

126
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,401
All right, guys.

127
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:11,831
I've been here for a half an hour.
Can I get my shoeshine?

128
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:14,834
Kyle, I'm gonna lose my **** on you
if you ask me one more time.

129
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:18,324
I found him.

130
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:20,878
Frank Beckerson.

131
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,589
63, lives in a little town
called Bridgeport.

132
00:06:24,753 --> 00:06:25,753
Illinois.

133
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:29,381
Divorced, no kids,
worked as a lifeguard when he was 20.

134
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:35,230
I need a half a day off
for a secret mission of love.

135
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:38,233
You're asking my permission
to take a nooner?

136
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:39,789
Sure. I don't know.

137
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:43,029
Maybe. Justin and I need to go
on a romantically inspired road trip.

138
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:44,679
So it is a nooner.

139
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,656
We're planning to leave around noon,
so I'm not quite sure...

140
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,952
It's not a nooner.

141
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,202
I tracked down
this old flame of Leslie's mom.

142
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,412
We're gonna go pick him up,
and reunite them on valentine's day.

143
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:56,501
A great story or what?

144
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,709
Yeah, great story indeed.

145
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,584
Enjoy your half day off.

146
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:04,676
- Pick you up tomorrow around noon.
- For our nooner, which is a cute word.

147
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,679
- Explain it to her later.
- Explain what?

148
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:10,065
Happy valentine's day.

149
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,999
First off, a bear in a paper bag

150
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:15,103
and a heart-shaped balloon.

151
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,126
I love bears and bags.

152
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,397
Well, you'll like this then,

153
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,653
because this is a giant teddy bear

154
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:23,528
holding a red heart.

155
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:26,239
Festive.
What's this?

156
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,742
I don't know.
It's a heart-shaped box of chocolates.

157
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,159
That's a dozen red roses
in a heart-shaped arrangement.

158
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,245
See that. Perfume.

159
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:35,987
For the lady.

160
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:39,399
Yearning, by Dennis Feinstein.

161
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,468
Finally, the heart of the ocean.

162
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:48,846
Gorgeous.

163
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,380
I never had a chance to get a girl

164
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:56,463
a cliched valentine's day
gift before,

165
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:58,354
so I got you all of 'em.

166
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,609
Thank you. That was very sweet.

167
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:06,110
Do you think they'll get married?
My God. What if they get married?

168
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:09,574
- That would be amazing.
- Would I call him dad then?

169
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:13,962
No, that'd be too much.
Maybe I'll call him pappy. Pop.

170
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:15,784
Poppy. Papa.

171
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:18,750
Look at me,
I'm getting ahead of myself.

172
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:20,319
You never know.

173
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:22,972
I'm gonna call him poo-paw.

174
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,216
How often do you get
to reunite soul mates?

175
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:29,227
What if I told you that you
could reunite romeo and juliet?

176
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:31,808
Or Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston?

177
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,954
Jen, I really want you to be happy.

178
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,646
Stay away from John Mayer.

179
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,030
I cannot believe I'm gonna
meet Frank Beckerson.

180
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,309
I feel like
I've known him my whole life.

181
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,852
My God!

182
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:53,108
- Marlene.
- No, poo-paw. Poo-paw, no.

183
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:54,619
I'm not marlene.

184
00:08:56,684 --> 00:08:58,839
I'm so sorry.
I should really wear my glasses.

185
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:00,014
Come on in.

186
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:08,675
I was wondering, my mom always said
that you wanted to be a lawyer.

187
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:11,341
- Did that work out?
- No. Never did.

188
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:13,555
Though I did once act
as my own lawyer.

189
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:17,684
You know what,
I found some pictures of Marlene and me.

190
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:19,978
Look.

191
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,369
Look how young she is.

192
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:27,121
- These are amazing.
- Probably shouldn't show you this one.

193
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,408
No, thank you.

194
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,189
You mom was such a firecracker.

195
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:36,828
Smart, funny, sharp as a tack.
Such firm breasts.

196
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,445
That was inappropriate.

197
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,866
I'm just, all of a sudden,

198
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:46,254
so nervous to see her again.

199
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,049
I'm gonna throw up real quick,
and then we can leave.

200
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:57,098
Valentine's bash at the Bulge tonight.
We can get you a drink bracelet.

201
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,848
I can't. I've got to work

202
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,561
at this senior center
valentine's day dance thing.

203
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:03,771
That sounds amazing. Can we come?

204
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,982
I don't know why you would want to.

205
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:09,110
- Because old people are funny.
- It'll be like The Golden Girls.

206
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:11,112
I have to go get ready.

207
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:15,950
So, where have you been
for the past 40 years?

208
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,936
You know, here and there.
You know, Grenada for a while.

209
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:23,586
Then Panama. Then Afghanistan.

210
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:25,752
- So you were in the military?
- Nope.

211
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,650
You know,
I always wonder how different

212
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:31,681
my life would have been
if your mother had married me.

213
00:10:31,806 --> 00:10:34,636
It would have been better.
I'll tell you that much.

214
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:40,708
- Frank, are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm good...

215
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:45,939
I am just so nervous to see her.

216
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:49,816
- There is nothing to be nervous about.
- Have you got a bag or something?

217
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,945
- Do you have a bag?
- I have a purse.

218
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:54,269
- Give him your purse.
- All right.

219
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,279
I mean, that sucked, didn't it?

220
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:20,930
Maybe if you sang it
like Louis Armstrong?

221
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,464
Maybe. Yeah.

222
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,400
I mean, here's the thing, though.

223
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:25,942
Who is that?

224
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:30,104
My problem is I don't know

225
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,474
how to tell if we're doing good

226
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:35,327
because, when you play rock,
it's easy to know if you're doing great

227
00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:37,828
because chicks
will flash their boobs at you

228
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,815
when you're up on stage.

229
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,774
You're like, oh, that must
have sounded pretty good.

230
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,737
But I can't... If that happens here,
my eyes will fall out of my head,

231
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:47,012
and I'll die.

232
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:55,388
Frank, are you okay?

233
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:00,763
Maybe we should...

234
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:14,867
I might be crazy,
but I have this weird suspicion

235
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:17,286
that things are going well with us.

236
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:20,283
You know,
I have that same suspicion.

237
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,828
But, having never been in something
like this before, I need to ask,

238
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,080
how am I doing?

239
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,620
Come on.

240
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:32,628
No, I'm sort of serious.

241
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:35,625
All right, fine. Forget it.

242
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,885
I'm just saying, you know,
it seems to me on paper

243
00:12:41,138 --> 00:12:44,766
- that this thing we've is pretty great.
- Yes, nerd, on paper,

244
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,983
this thing we have is pretty great.

245
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:48,478
Mark is a great boyfriend.

246
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,569
I have no complaints at all.

247
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:53,089
Everything is good.

248
00:12:57,535 --> 00:13:00,029
I don't know.
I don't feel right about this.

249
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,654
Are you kidding me?
This is so much fun.

250
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:05,401
Look, we took a road trip today.

251
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:08,172
We chased your mom's
long-lost love down a freeway.

252
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:09,564
He's a loon, Justin.

253
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,223
So he freaked out a little bit.
He got nervous. You would too.

254
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:13,841
And he was fine inside the car.

255
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:17,446
Yeah, well, he cried himself to sleep.
I don't know why you're pushing.

256
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:20,716
Why do you want him to spend time
with my mom? How would that help her?

257
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,554
I don't think this is gonna work.
I'm calling this off.

258
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:26,474
Come on. Look, we're here.
Just see what happens.

259
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:29,010
- What happens is I drive him home.
- Now, you need to breathe.

260
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:30,735
I'm breathing, okay...

261
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,155
There you are.

262
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,178
So what's the big surprise?

263
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,493
You gonna try to check me
into an old folks' home?

264
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:49,245
It's a long story. One that we'd love
to tell you over a cup of coffee

265
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,370
somewhere far from this place.

266
00:14:01,221 --> 00:14:04,053
I can't believe it's really you.

267
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:07,190
Want to catch up?

268
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:10,168
Sure.

269
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,079
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

270
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:21,815
Do you think we should stand by...

271
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:23,873
She's fine.

272
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,341
Let's just let this unfold.

273
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:32,239
Come here, sonny.
Let me tell you about the civil war.

274
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:34,917
Grandpa, leave me alone.
You smell like death.

275
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,643
I'm gonna get some punch.

276
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,393
You guys are really adorable.

277
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,452
That's really nice.

278
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:55,064
So Leslie's like, "that's it.
I'm taking him home."

279
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,616
So we look over,
and he's not even in the car anymore.

280
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:00,617
- You're kidding.
- No. It's insane.

281
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,988
What does Leslie
think about all this?

282
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:08,045
Oh, God, Leslie, I don't even know.
I lost track of her in all the chaos.

283
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,454
Anyway, so now he and Marlene
are off somewhere, doing God knows what.

284
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,901
I don't want to know.

285
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:21,380
You're suing me for alimony?

286
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:25,657
When we were married,
I got accustomed

287
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:29,180
to a certain lifestyle, and I'm entitled
to money to maintain that lifestyle.

288
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,848
This is insane.

289
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:32,820
Yeah, it's insane,
but it's all I got.

290
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:36,270
And you could make it all go away
if you just gave me a chance.

291
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:38,105
- What?
- Three dates.

292
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:41,369
One date.

293
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,903
Coffee?

294
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:46,586
So your plan was to sue me

295
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:50,159
and then to use that to blackmail me
into falling in love with you?

296
00:16:00,786 --> 00:16:02,289
You guys sound good.

297
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,262
You really think so?

298
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,985
It's impossible to tell.
It's like bizarro land out there.

299
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,471
As soon as we finish a song,
it's dead silence.

300
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,641
What do you expect, you know?
They're like a million years old.

301
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,228
Well, I'm glad you like it.
You were a big supporter of the band.

302
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:19,412
Hey, break's over.

303
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,607
Ludgate, cracking the whip.

304
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,804
Yeah, well, these old bags
paid for some entertainment,

305
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:25,929
so get...

306
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,158
- You're right.
- Up there.

307
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:32,034
You should play The Way
You Look Tonight. That's a good one.

308
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:35,215
Next one's going out
to a special little lady

309
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,665
named April Ludgate.

310
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:49,388
Are you guys...

311
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:50,979
Never mind.

312
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,625
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

313
00:17:01,648 --> 00:17:04,066
Now what about you?
What do you do for a living?

314
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,031
Well, it's been an interesting ride.

315
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:11,802
I got a job at a grocery store
right out of college.

316
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:13,868
Just for a way to make money.

317
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:17,079
Here I am, 40 years later,

318
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:18,956
completely unemployed.

319
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,326
What do you say...

320
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:27,969
we pick up where we left off?

321
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,593
You're not serious, right?

322
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,561
Serious as a heart attack.

323
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,388
Of which I've had four.

324
00:17:58,163 --> 00:18:02,041
- Are you okay? Did Frank leave?
- Yeah, he stepped away for a second.

325
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:04,629
- I'm so sorry we brought him here.
- Oh, it's okay.

326
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:06,545
It was very thoughtful, sweetheart.

327
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:08,589
It's not your fault
that he turned out to be...

328
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:15,429
My name is Frank Beckerson.

329
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:19,073
Marlene, you...

330
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,061
blew it.

331
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,811
Take one last look, Marlene,

332
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:29,940
because you'll never see
this body again.

333
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:33,944
What happened between you two?

334
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,950
Tell me everything.
I want every detail.

335
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,316
We're almost done,
so we can leave soon.

336
00:18:39,617 --> 00:18:43,621
I'll take you for an ice cream malt,
and then we can go choose our caskets.

337
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:47,962
Why does everything we do
must be cloaked in 15 layers of irony?

338
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:52,425
Here's something unironic.
Since you know that meathead,

339
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:54,593
you've become completely lame.

340
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,595
We're breaking up.

341
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:02,309
- You can't make out with me anymore.
- Fine. Then I'll make out with Ben.

342
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:04,622
- Pass.
- No, he's my boyfriend.

343
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,851
You can either make out
with both of us or none of us.

344
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:08,926
- Fine. None of you.
- Fine.

345
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:25,082
Everything okay, Knope?

346
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:27,609
My boyfriend is a lawyer,

347
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,640
and he's smart and interesting,

348
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:32,292
and there's a lot
of things about him I like.

349
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,717
But he acted like a real jerk today.

350
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:37,428
I don't know.
There's something about the way

351
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,805
he treats people or something.

352
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:41,891
He's a tourist.

353
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:44,853
He vacations in people's lives,

354
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:48,353
takes pictures,
puts 'em in a scrapbook, and moves on.

355
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:51,108
All he's interested in are stories.

356
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:56,762
Basically, Leslie, he's selfish.

357
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:00,952
And you're not.
And that's why you don't like him.

358
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:05,915
I told you so.
It's Duke Silver.

359
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,751
Duke, can I have your autograph?

360
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,319
I love your music.

361
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:13,839
You're mistaken, ladies.
Move along.

362
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:22,807
Yeah, go Mouse Rat!

363
00:20:26,328 --> 00:20:28,187
I thought you were just terrific.

364
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,480
Seriously?

365
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:31,190
You sound like Dean Martin.

366
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:34,822
If I were 50 years younger...

367
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:39,448
Wait, who's Dean Martin?

368
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:42,919
If I'm not mistaken, that was
the old lady version of flashing.

369
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,829
Nailed the gig.

370
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,037
Look, it's sad. I know.

371
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:49,166
But we'll still be friends.

372
00:20:49,524 --> 00:20:51,397
We're gonna see
each other all the time.

373
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:55,035
- I come into town every other weekend.
- No. You guys can't break up.

374
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,424
- We can fix this. Let me talk to her.
- Tom, it's over.

375
00:20:57,736 --> 00:21:00,811
- She doesn't want to see me anymore.
- Is it my fault? Did I do something?

376
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:04,440
Seriously,
this has nothing to do with you.

377
00:21:04,756 --> 00:21:07,226
- Can we still go suit shopping?
- Of course.

378
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,103
Armani's having a sale right now.

379
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:12,398
- Time to get you a pocket square.
- All right.
