1
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:06,238
Okay, everybody,
time for the hummingbird lottery.

2
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:11,092
You know how it works.
Write your name down on a paper.

3
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:12,748
No, they don't win a hummingbird.

4
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,542
I installed hummingbird feeders
in all of the parks.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,889
So the winner
gets to refill those feeders.

6
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:20,214
Scientifically,

7
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:22,682
hummingbirds
are the world's cutest animals.

8
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:24,635
They're so small,

9
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:26,051
they have tiny beaks.

10
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:27,888
And they only eat sugar water.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,919
I mean, what beats that?

12
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:33,121
Come on.
Baby monkeys in diapers?

13
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:37,272
They do.
Baby monkeys in diapers are the cutest.

14
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:39,817
- Okay, who's it gonna be?
- Not me. Not me.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,771
You can stop by tomorrow morning,
before work.

16
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,365
This is my 3rd time in a row.

17
00:00:46,892 --> 00:00:50,077
It's just a bad luck streak. Next time,
I'm sure it'll definitely be one of us.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,739
But it won't be me
because I always write...

19
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:00,392
No. I always write my own name.

20
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:01,823
But,

21
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,491
just to be safe, I do add

22
00:01:04,788 --> 00:01:06,348
20 extra Jerrys.

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,846

Finally, we're going to kick off

29
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:31,042
the children's concert series
this weekend

30
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:33,328
with a performance
by Freddy Spaghetti.

31
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:36,573
- I thought Freddy Spaghetti O.D.'d.
- No. That's Mr. Funny Noodle.

32
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:38,459
He didn't O.D.
His drummer shot him.

33
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:40,613
Where's Jerry, by the way?

34
00:01:40,738 --> 00:01:43,112
Why isn't he back? How long does it take
to fill bird feeders?

35
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,300
Maybe he fell into the toilet.
Remember when he fell into the toilet?

36
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,857
"Sorry, guys. I'm late.

37
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:52,347
"I got confused and took a shower
after I got dressed 'cause I'm Jerry."

38
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:57,270
David Meyers,
the Jewish guy who works at city hall,

39
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:58,903
once told me something.

40
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:01,461
A schlemiel, is the guy

41
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:03,935
who spills soup at a fancy party.

42
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,137
A schlimazel,

43
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:07,056
is the guy he spills it on.

44
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:12,387
Jerry is both the schlemiel and
the schlimazel of our office.

45
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,663
"And then I put my underwear on my head
instead of my butt."

46
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:20,424
Okay, guys, that's enough.

47
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:22,753
Unless somebody has another one.

48
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:34,014
Jerry, are you okay? Ann, is Jerry okay?
What's wrong with your arm?

49
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:36,183
What's wrong with his arm.
Jerry, talk to me.

50
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:38,715
- Ann, get Jerry to talk to me.
- He's okay.

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,897
He's got a couple of scrapes
and a dislocated shoulder.

52
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:43,065
What happened?

53
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,442
- You guys are just gonna laugh.
- Why?

54
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,320
Did you throw it out trying to swing
a honey pot off your hand?

55
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:49,446
I was mugged.

56
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:53,075
My God.
I'm so sorry, Jerry.

57
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:55,744
I was on my way
to the hummingbird feeders,

58
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,454
and I was walking Lord Sheldon.

59
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,993
Is that code
for some kind of weird sex act?

60
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,626
Lord Sheldon is my dog.
My wife named him.

61
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,565
These kids came out of nowhere.
They pinned my arm back,

62
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,791
grabbed my wallet,
and knocked me to the ground.

63
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,345
How did you counterattack?
Fist to the throat?

64
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,828
Hit in the beanbag?

65
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:15,488
There's no shame
in attacking a criminal's beanbag.

66
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,933
No, I just curled up
and laid still till they left.

67
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,490
Well, that's another way to play it.

68
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:24,315
Did any of them have weird tattoos
or scars or anything?

69
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,150
If even one of them had a unique scar,
we got 'em.

70
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,862
- I didn't get a good look.
- Damn it, Jerry.

71
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,114
You're the victim.

72
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:33,073
Sorry.

73
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,087
I feel we're responsible for this.

74
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:38,012
Why?
We didn't mug Jerry.

75
00:03:38,913 --> 00:03:40,366
Why was he in the park?

76
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,374
'Cause we tricked him.
I don't see the link.

77
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,371
This is on us. It's karma.

78
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:47,417
Wouldn't it be karma
if we got mugged?

79
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:50,674
That's how pathetic Jerry is.
He can't even get karma right.

80
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:53,093
That's not funny.

81
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:59,850
Our friend got mugged this morning.
And we will not let that happen in vain.

82
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:01,435
He doesn't have a black eye.

83
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:03,701
The whole department
has a black eye.

84
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,451
This is our wakeup call, guys.

85
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,357
Jerry's face
is the symbol of failure.

86
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,903
Our failure.
To keep the parks safe.

87
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,753
I have some folders.
Inside are some assignments.

88
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,074
And some homemade taffy.

89
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:20,677
April, check in
with our police liaison.

90
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,456
Donna, go to Ramsett park.

91
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:25,228
- Tom, you're with me.
- So when you say,

92
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:28,670
check in with the police liaison,
you mean hook up with him, right?

93
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,715
Just check in with him.
Everybody dismissed.

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,630
Wait. I want to help.

95
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:38,586
I'm gonna teach everybody self-defense,
so you can defend yourselves.

96
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:41,518
We need it 'cause we certainly
are a bunch of weaklings.

97
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:43,995
- Especially Tom.
- I am not a weakling.

98
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,420
- Arm-wrestle me right now.
- Okay.

99
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:49,886
I think I'm more
than holding my own here.///

100
00:04:58,304 --> 00:05:00,369
- Hey. How you doing?
- Not too bad.

101
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:04,122
I was dropping off Jerry.
He was mugged in the park.

102
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,755
No. Jerry?

103
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:09,252
The black guy
with the looney tunes ties? I love him.

104
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:11,129
Jerry who works with Leslie.

105
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:14,506
That Jerry?
He got mugged?

106
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:18,675
That's kind of a bummer too.

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,711
While you here,
what do you think of this?

108
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:24,935
Scrotation Marks.

109
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:27,980
I don't know what you're talking about,
but my gut says no.

110
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,398
New band name.

111
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:33,399
'Cause, Mouse Rat, it's a great name,
but, at the same time,

112
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,808
it sucks.

113
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,738
So we have to change it
one more time.

114
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:39,036
Dude, you've got to stop doing that.

115
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:41,326
How are people gonna become fans
if they don't know

116
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:43,407
the name of the band
they're listening to?

117
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:44,997
Good point.

118
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:47,730
I always had fun with Andy.

119
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:51,284
But, when you're his girlfriend,
you're also his mother,

120
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,343
and his maid, and his nurse.

121
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:57,792
He's completely helpless.
He's like a baby in a straightjacket.

122
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,716
Baby in a straightjacket.
That's a good band name.

123
00:06:01,078 --> 00:06:02,341
I should tell him that.

124
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,060
- Really funny. Where's the real banner?
- We only had an hour.

125
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:09,078
So did I.
Look what I did.

126
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,233
Welcome back.

127
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:17,195
Really. You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

128
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,948
It's no trouble for our buddy.
Here you go.

129
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,491
Today is Jerry day.

130
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:24,578
We'll do whatever you want to do.

131
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:28,098
Honestly, what I would like to do
is have everything go back to normal.

132
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:29,595
That sounds good to me.

133
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,842
I believe you were going
to do a presentation?

134
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,888
Yes, sir, I was.
I will go set up.

135
00:06:36,316 --> 00:06:38,986
Remember, you guys,
no jokes, no comments,

136
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,373
nothing but support.

137
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:42,055
He needs a lot of support.

138
00:06:43,723 --> 00:06:45,387
I'm talking about a bra for a man.

139
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:49,028
Seriously, that was the last one.

140
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,063
So as we know,

141
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,974
spring hunting season is upon us.

142
00:06:54,758 --> 00:06:56,408
Anyway, here's the info

143
00:06:57,104 --> 00:06:58,757
about the new licensing system.

144
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:03,492
I don't think
your computer's plugged in.

145
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,451
Sorry.

146
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:07,597
Just gotta power up.
First thing we should have

147
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,940
is my graph about the season.

148
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,833
What? Wait a minute.
No.

149
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:15,512
That's not the graph. That's a picture
from my vacation in Muncie.

150
00:07:16,256 --> 00:07:18,799
You went on a vacation,
and you chose Muncie, Indiana?

151
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:20,634
My wife and I have a timeshare.

152
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:22,456
In Muncie?

153
00:07:23,392 --> 00:07:25,092
Muncie is a lovely city.

154
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:28,765
Anyway, hunting and fishing season
is winding down.

155
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,923
And we all know that it's already
closed season on twout.

156
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:32,771
So...

157
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:35,023
I said "twout",

158
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,525
instead of "trout".

159
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:38,026
It happens to everyone.

160
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:40,153
My marbles are full of mouth today.

161
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:42,171
You know what,

162
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:45,195
has anybody seen my glasses?
I don't even think I can...

163
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:56,086
It says here 1:00 meeting.
Who are we meeting with?

164
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:58,839
- Don't worry about it.
- Please no.

165
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:00,917
It's important to meet
with the park rangers.

166
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,926
They are the first line of defense.

167
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,802
What's up, pencil pushers?

168
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:10,600
Good to see you, man.

169
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:14,771
Is it hot in here? I feel hot.
Are you guys hot?

170
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,440
How you guys doing? I'm good.

171
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:17,983
You guys got any snacks?

172
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:21,236
Carl is the head
of all outdoor security.

173
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:23,982
Why was he transferred
from his indoor desk job, you ask.

174
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:25,497
- Listen.
- It's so sweet.

175
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,544
Hey, Leslie, have you seen Avatar?

176
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:29,269
I never saw Avatar.

177
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,353
I wanted to read the book first,

178
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:34,496
but then I realized
there's no book version of Avatar.

179
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:36,756
What'd you guys do
for St. Patty's day?

180
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,753
I was wearing this t-shirt that said :
"Kiss me. I'm Irish."

181
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,548
But no one would kiss me.

182
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:43,804
So...

183
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:48,305
you're too important for me
until one of your own gets attacked.

184
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,464
I just feel like there's more we can do
to keep the parks safe.

185
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:54,836
You think you know how to do my job?

186
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:57,365
You might not be so confident
once you've walked a mile

187
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,890
in my size sevens.

188
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:01,577
Kind of small feet.

189
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:03,570
Seven is the worldwide average.

190
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:09,568
Welcome to the emergency
self-defense class.

191
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:13,079
I'll be showing you how to escape
from a variety of situations

192
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:16,500
while inflicting maximum damage
on your attackers.

193
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,360
Do you think that maybe
I should put Mark in a headlock?

194
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:22,685
That way I can show everyone
how to escape a pervert.

195
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:26,161
In the scenario you just laid out,
you're the pervert.

196
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:28,136
You understand that, right?

197
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,721
- You wish.
- Enough.

198
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm gonna start off simple

199
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:35,439
and demonstrate how to extract
oneself from a wrist grab.

200
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,511
Andy, Ann, step up here.

201
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,825
I watch a lot of lifetime movies.

202
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,070
There was this one,
How far is too far enough:

203
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,328
the Teri Palliber Lonergan story.

204
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:48,502
This woman had agoraphobia,
and her therapist was obsessed with her.

205
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,747
And he hid in her house,
and then he attacked her

206
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:52,535
and tried to eat her toes.

207
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:55,121
Also, her daughter
was having sex way too young.

208
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:59,265
So yeah, free
self-defense class, I'm there.

209
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,518
And just twist your weight.

210
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:04,798
Very good.
Very good. Well done.

211
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,849
What's up now, mugger?

212
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,802
That was awesome.
That was really good.

213
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:13,974
I don't know, Leslie.
I'd rather be back at the office.

214
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:17,697
I know this is painful for you, Jerry,
but you have to be strong.

215
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:20,438
You guys ready?

216
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,122
Oh, boy, yeah.
Okay, we're ready.

217
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:27,153
I'm gonna show you guys
all the problems we've been facing.

218
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:29,698
I'm gonna show you
we've been doing everything we can.

219
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:31,887
I'm looking forward
to working together, Carl.

220
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:34,244
And after that, I'm gonna
show you this log I found.

221
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,714
It's got, like, 50 worms on it.

222
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,060
I call it worm log.

223
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:43,162
Yeah, I've always been
a bit of an outdoorsman.

224
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:45,347
When I was a kid,
my parents used to make me hang out

225
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:48,632
in the backyard a lot
and just run around till I got tired.

226
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:52,909
But if there's any criminals
out there watching, I never get tired.

227
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:55,146
And ladies too.

228
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:01,322
- This thing is a mess.
- We used to have three carts actually.

229
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:04,479
The first one got pushed into the creek
by some kids.

230
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:08,373
The second one raccoons got onto.
There was urine everywhere.

231
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:10,697
And the third one
was recently stolen.

232
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,836
- What's this one?
- This is the second one.

233
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:14,511
The raccoon piss one.

234
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:18,413
All right, so we're gonna
just head out.

235
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,461
I think we got too much weight.

236
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,881
That's Tom probably.

237
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:31,365
- Are you serious?
- Tom, can you get off please?

238
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:33,752
Just run alongside the cart, okay?

239
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,055
Okay, here we go.

240
00:11:36,804 --> 00:11:39,179
So let me tell you
a little bit about the park.

241
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:40,447
Up here on the left

242
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:43,222
is one of our most beautiful
grass fields.

243
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:45,974
It's primarily grass.

244
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:49,615
I'm gonna make a hard left here.
Stick with us, Tom.

245
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:52,118
Okay.
Lesson learned.

246
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:54,324
Next, Andy.

247
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:58,322
Impressive.

248
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:02,290
I'm gonna engage Andy in an attack hold,
and he's gonna try and break free.

249
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:05,293
Cool.
Now I don't want to hurt you, Ron.

250
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,629
Don't worry about that.
Just try to escape my attack.

251
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:10,894
Now when I get out,
am I allowed to counterstrike?

252
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,534
Sure.
When you get out,

253
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,145
you may counterattack.

254
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,420
But just promise me you'll be ready
because, I mean,

255
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:21,943
I don't want to destroy you.

256
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:25,937
I see where we're going with this.

257
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,773
Now when your arms
are pinned to your sides,

258
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,277
use your legs to break free

259
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,738
instead of your neck,
which is what Andy's trying to do.

260
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:37,483
Okay, hold on.

261
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,109
Let him go.

262
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:50,922
Any of this looking familiar?

263
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,665
Yeah, it happened right over there.

264
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:56,595
I'm not surprised.

265
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:58,138
Take a look at this path.

266
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:01,349
With budget cuts,
we can't afford a single safety light.

267
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:03,603
There's been ten assaults
already this year.

268
00:13:03,728 --> 00:13:04,736
Really?

269
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:07,067
- Can't you station a park ranger?
- We have.

270
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,262
Who do you think they're assaulting?

271
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,526
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell.

272
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:15,044
One way or another, I'm gonna get money
so you can protect Jerry

273
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,991
and all the other helpless,
pathetic people in this town.

274
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:22,662
You guys got to slow down.

275
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:25,221
- Can I just take a rest for a minute?
- Sorry. No can do.

276
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,844
Sun's going down.
It's dangerous.

277
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,369
- Let's roll, Carl.
- Okay, going fast.

278
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:34,674
What day is it today?

279
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,511
- I don't know.
- Okay, but to be fair, you never know.

280
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,911
That's kind of true.
I'm super bad at days.

281
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:45,059
But honestly I'm fine.

282
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,811
Sorry I squeezed
your lights out there, son.

283
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:50,681
No worries. Will you show me
how to do that move, though?

284
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:52,614
Sure. I can teach you right now.

285
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:54,798
You shouldtake it easy, I think.

286
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:58,023
Do you want some more water
or maybe some pancakes?

287
00:13:58,439 --> 00:13:59,783
No, no, no.
I'm fine.

288
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:04,204
- What's the first move in any fight?
- Punch to the balls.

289
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:07,165
We've all heard the old saying,

290
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,380
"Parks are supposed to be fun,"

291
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:11,753
but sometimes muggers
have their own ideas.

292
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,643
Leslie Knope is with us again

293
00:14:13,768 --> 00:14:15,762
from the parks department.

294
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,334
Tell us your story.

295
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:21,054
This is my coworker Jerry Gergich,

296
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
diabetic,

297
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:24,724
sloppily out of shape,

298
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,267
friend.

299
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,137
He was mugged this morning

300
00:14:28,312 --> 00:14:29,521
in Ramsett park.

301
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:32,774
Who's next?
Your frumpy uncle?

302
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:34,601
Your simple neighbor?

303
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:36,989
Your unpopular coworker?

304
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,227
Head of security Carl Lorthner
is doing his best

305
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:42,534
to keep the parks safe,
but he's failing.

306
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:45,036
So what is the solution to fix this?

307
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,185
To make it right

308
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,164
and not bad?

309
00:14:50,148 --> 00:14:53,336
We need money from city hall,
and it's not coming through.

310
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:55,841
And, Pawnee, I am sorry to say this

311
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:58,007
but your government is failing you.

312
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:01,838
Up next, ten objects
you didn't know you can eat.

313
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:05,747
What possessed you to do that?

314
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,993
I'm sorry, Paul, but one of my guys
got mugged in the park.

315
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,318
I don't care how upset you are,

316
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:14,774
you do not badmouth
your own government on TV.

317
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,861
I'm sure you'll be happy to know
your little stunt worked.

318
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,614
The mayor's going to divert $2,500

319
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:24,576
to the parks for security upgrades.

320
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,766
There'll be an announcement tomorrow
at 10:00 in the press room,

321
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,832
so make sure you bring the doofus
that got his ass kicked.

322
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:35,537
I don't know who you're referring to.
We treat everyone with respect.

323
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:41,634
Good morning.
As many of you know,

324
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:45,696
there was an incident
involving a government employee

325
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,650
in Ramsett park.

326
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:51,144
Jerry, are you nervous?
Just talk about how hard it was for you.

327
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:53,438
Speak from the heart.
You'll be fine.

328
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,233
I wasn't mugged.

329
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:05,319
- Jerry, why don't you step on up here?
- No, no, I will get up here.

330
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:09,954
I'm gonna speak for Jerry.

331
00:16:10,122 --> 00:16:13,495
He can't talk right now
because he has hysterical muteness.

332
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:16,252
- From trauma.
- Correct.

333
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:21,149
What about this?
Is this fake?

334
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:23,718
This is real.
I really dislocated my shoulder.

335
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,553
Were you even in the park yesterday?

336
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:27,889
Look, I was on my way
to feed the hummingbirds,

337
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:30,066
and I stopped
for a breakfast burrito.

338
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:31,749
The farting.

339
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:34,206
And, lord Sheldon,
he lunged at a bird,

340
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:37,023
I dropped the burrito, and it
lands on a log in the creek.

341
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:39,070
So I go to reach for it,
I lose my balance,

342
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:41,027
and I fall on my shoulder
really weird.

343
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:43,193
Why didn't you
just tell everybody the truth?

344
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,616
Are you kidding me?
Imagine what Tom would have said.

345
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:50,619
Damn, Jerry,
you jumped in a creek for a burrito?

346
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:53,054
What would you do for a Klondike bar?
Kill your wife?

347
00:16:53,988 --> 00:16:57,126
Block the opponent's punch
and counterpunch to the jaw.

348
00:16:58,478 --> 00:16:59,478
Shoeshine?

349
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:04,264
Ann Perkins in the shoe shouse.

350
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:07,677
I wanted to check in.
I brought some stuff from the hospital.

351
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:10,835
Water, compress,
aspirin, some lollipops.

352
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,020
- I know you love those.
- You know, thank you,

353
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,020
but I'm really... I'm feeling great.
I took a couple of aspirin

354
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:18,513
and slept right through the night and...
Hold on a second.

355
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,650
Ludgate!
What the hell?

356
00:17:21,186 --> 00:17:23,361
I got you
those muffins that you're always eating.

357
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,567
Score.

358
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:27,248
- Tastes like a rug.
- Shut up.

359
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,704
- Good, I'm glad you're feeling better.
- I am. Thank you for that.

360
00:17:33,238 --> 00:17:34,488
That's so cool.

361
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:37,605
Since when did he start doing stuff
for other people?

362
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,762
Now I actually am worried
that something happened to his brain.

363
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,810
People change, I guess.

364
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:47,844
Wouldn't you rather the money
go to keeping the parks safe?

365
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:50,388
Yes, but now we have the money
under false pretences.

366
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:52,849
I actually think
that you have a bigger problem.

367
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,017
What?

368
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,397
There is someone in your department
who is willing to lie

369
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:59,522
about being mugged because
he's afraid of his coworkers.

370
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:09,365
Carl, what are you doing here?

371
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:14,037
Well, since you decided
to drag my name through the mud on TV,

372
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:15,936
I figured why not return the favor?

373
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,832
Carl, could you quietly quiet down

374
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:20,974
for a second and please tell me
what's going on quietly?

375
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,437
In a quiet voice.

376
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:27,131
A citizen handed in
a very interesting home video

377
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:31,095
that I think the people of Pawnee
will find very interesting.

378
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:32,894
Take a peek at this.

379
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:37,767
Keep your eyes on the creek.

380
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,238
There he is.

381
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:43,274
This is my favorite part.

382
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:46,486
Not willing to share with a dog.

383
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:50,323
So it would appear that park security
was not to blame after all.

384
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,563
Okay, look,
I have a proposition for you.

385
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,229
Fine. I'll have sex with you
in exchange for the tape.

386
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:58,884
That's not what I'm saying!
Okay?

387
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:02,318
Just listen to what I have to say.

388
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,902
The Ramsett park mugging story
continues

389
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:08,966
with a shiny new twist.

390
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,888
Ranger Carl Lorthner is here today.

391
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:17,058
Now I understand
that you have a bombshell

392
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:20,079
to drop
that you are just sitting on.

393
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,605
Yes, that's correct.

394
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:26,692
I came on today because I have
some important information to share.

395
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,734
I finally saw Avatar,

396
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,823
and I thought it lived up
to the hype.

397
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:35,643
I'm not sure
what that has to do with the mugging.

398
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,917
Leslie, counterpoint.

399
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:40,540
I disagree with Carl.

400
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:43,507
I have seen avatar as well.

401
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,729
And I think it exceeded the hype.

402
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,002
What?

403
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:48,368
Oh, boy.

404
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,984
- We...
- Disagreement.

405
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,763
Well, things are
really heating up in here. Aren't they?

406
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:57,014
We should probably take some calls.

407
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:59,719
That segment was a disaster!

408
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:04,389
Don't you ever **** me like that again.
This is Pawnee ***** today.

409
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:08,492
Do you know that for you I bumped a cat
that can stand up on its hinders?

410
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:10,945
You disgust me, Knope.
Get out of my sight.

411
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:12,735
- Yes, ma'am.
- Go.

412
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,452
Don't make me chase you.
You want to go eat something.

413
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:21,747
I am part of a great team.

414
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:25,152
And sometimes the best way
to maintain a strong team

415
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:28,520
is just by letting someone know
that he is still a part of it.

416
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:30,579
This is the only copy.

417
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:32,704
And I am going to destroy it.

418
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:36,661
Right after I watch it
one more time.

419
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:40,721
I'm sorry, but it is so good.

420
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:46,397
- I got you a peppermint latte.
- Seriously?

421
00:20:47,712 --> 00:20:50,082
- My goodness. I love a pepp...
- I know.

422
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:53,360
Jeez.

423
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,031
Go ahead.

424
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,947
We should just directly
apply the food to your clothes.

425
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,697
Making fun of Jerry's back.

426
00:21:02,664 --> 00:21:06,184
They can laugh at me all they want.
Because two more years until I retire

427
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,210
with full benefits and pension.

428
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:11,130
And my wife and I, we have bought
a little cottage on a lake.

429
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:14,222
And I'm gonna make myself
a stack of mystery novels,

430
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:18,122
a box of cigars and I could sit back
and enjoy my life.

431
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:24,163
April was double-checked the lunch order
you want the salmon or the twout?

432
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,511
Twout! Twout! Twout!
