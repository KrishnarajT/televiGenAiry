00:00:03,485 --> 00:00:06,141
We, now, go live
the councilman Bill Dexhart

2
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:09,323
who's giving a press conference
about his sex scandal.

3
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:16,456
You are getting a rare glimpse
at this exclusive,

4
00:00:16,624 --> 00:00:17,998
government-only event.

5
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:20,285
Each December,
one department puts on a show

6
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,086
that spoofs
what happened in our town.

7
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:24,286
Prepare to laugh your Asnov!

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,418
Sid Asnov
is a former city councilman.

9
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:31,512
Some of the jokes
are sort of inside.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,097
Councilman Dexhart,
you're involved in yet another scandal?

11
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:38,222
That's crazier
than mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus.

12
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:45,084
Yes, there is a new one,
and it's a doozy.

13
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:47,894
I don't want to go into the details,
but let me just say

14
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:50,119
that it involves multiple women,

15
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:52,576
a love child, nurses,

16
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:55,380
rabbis, priests.

17
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:00,931
I hope you can all join me
at my fundraiser tonight.

18
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:02,726
I am being supported, of course,

19
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:05,501
by the glitter factory
and 1-800-mattress.

20
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:09,624
Classic.

21
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:13,703
Pawnee is a city that ain't very pretty
and good government is our goal

22
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:16,389
We may not be big
and our mayor wears a wig

23
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:19,018
But at least the Raccoon infestation
is under control

24
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:20,978
It's the most wonderful time

25
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:26,255
In Pawnee

26
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:34,242

Christmas Scandal

lestat78

31
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,638
Lot 48 was once
a horrible and disgusting pit.

32
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,308
And now it's the site
of Pawnee's winter wonderland.

33
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:01,835
This couldn't be more perfect
if I'd planned it myself.

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,010
Which I did.
And it's awesome.

35
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:06,774
So let's talk schedge.
The kids are gonna come

36
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,543
at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday,

37
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:10,861
and everyone's gonna do Santa
for two hours.

38
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:13,675
So I would just advise everyone
before you get in your costume

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,309
to go to the bathroom
so we can avoid what happened last year.

40
00:02:16,434 --> 00:02:17,827
It was just farts.

41
00:02:17,995 --> 00:02:19,954
6:00 p.m.,
caroling with the youth choir.

42
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:22,540
And I am proud to announce
for the first time ever,

43
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,502
this year, our tree-lighting ceremony
will be simulcast on internet radio.

44
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:31,285
- That's a really big deal.
- It is.

45
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,742
Listening to that tree lighting
is gonna be dope!

46
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:36,596
Any questions, direct them to me?
Dismissed.

47
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:42,142
There was a message for you
on the work voicemail.

48
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:45,144
Councilman Dexhart
wants to meet with you at 9:00 p.m..

49
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,315
- The boardwalk lounge.
- Shut up.

50
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,611
I'm not scared.
I got nothing to apologize for.

51
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:54,614
I could have been a lot harder on him.
He got off easy.

52
00:02:55,338 --> 00:02:56,338
And often.

53
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,827
Thank you.
I'll be here all week.

54
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,425
Tell me about him.
I don't know anything.

55
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:05,203
He's 23, he's kinda my boyfriend.

56
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:08,412
He's gay. Last year we got drunk
and he took me to the Ice Capades,

57
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:10,129
and I didn't get him anything.

58
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:11,631
And he's gay?

59
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:13,966
Brokeback mountain dvd.
Fellas love that.

60
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,260
- Does he have chaps? Assless chaps?
- Forget it.

61
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,598
Why are you asking me?

62
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:23,382
Because, there's no one else to ask.

63
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:25,394
And you're kind of young.

64
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:28,320
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna think about it.

65
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:31,178
I'm gonna mull it over.
It's all I'm gonna think about.

66
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,528
I'm gonna come up
with something really good.

67
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:35,613
- All right.
- You got that?

68
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:41,202
Councilman Dexhart,
I'm Leslie Knope.

69
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,983
- Thank you for meeting me.
- It's my pleasure.

70
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:46,417
I am assuming
this is about my performance

71
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,663
in the government follies
last night.

72
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,499
I'd just like to say
that I have nothing to apologize for.

73
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:54,882
- Except for perhaps being too incisive.
- I don't want you to apologize.

74
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:58,238
I want to know who told you.

75
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,105
Who told me? Nobody.

76
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,190
Nobody told me nuttin'!

77
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,188
- What are we talking about?
- Based on that skit,

78
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,980
I know you've heard about
the new scandal that's about to break.

79
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:11,163
Who told you?

80
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:14,652
Was it the babysitter?
The nurse who delivered our love child?

81
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,986
Stop playing dumb.

82
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,990
You know damn well what happened.

83
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:19,737
I got the babysitter pregnant.

84
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:23,231
Then, when she was in the delivery room,
I had sex with not one,

85
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,830
but four nurses in a supply closet.

86
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:29,533
As well as a woman whose husband
was getting a liver transplant.

87
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,648
Which one of them told you?

88
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,214
Was it the liver lady?

89
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,214
Well, I... no one...

90
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,636
I haven't heard any of this ever

91
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,296
in my whole life.

92
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,515
I would have remembered this.

93
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,509
In that case,

94
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,819
everything I just told you
was just a funny prank.

95
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,779
How was your meeting?

96
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:00,523
It was fine.

97
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:02,408
Pretty straightforward.

98
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:04,478
Short meeting.
You know, he's a busy guy.

99
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,412
Yes, very busy.
Look at this article.

100
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:11,643
What the...

101
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:17,098
The story of this story is
that it won't stop developing.

102
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:19,550
The mystery woman
who met with councilman Dexhart

103
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:23,471
appears to be a government employee
named Leslie Nope.

104
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:24,822
My God.

105
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:27,565
According to unconfirmed reports
in the Pawnee Sun,

106
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,893
the two bent an elbow

107
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:31,896
at this local watering hole.
And although they left separately,

108
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:34,023
no one knows where they woke up

109
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:35,024
together.

110
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:36,554
Perd Hapley, Channel 4 News.

111
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:43,366
All I did was write and perform
in one amazing skit.

112
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:44,997
It's the Pawnee sun.

113
00:05:45,122 --> 00:05:47,244
It's a tabloid.
Nobody else has written about it.

114
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:50,620
No one believes that garbage.
Nobody even reads that thing.

115
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:53,209
Leslie, what?
Nice work, girl.

116
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:57,227
How do I fight back?
Give me some options.

117
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:59,852
Do you want me
to seduce Perd Hapley?

118
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:01,676
How would that help?

119
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,965
I don't know.
I want to see if I can do it.

120
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:08,933
I don't think it's something worth
losing your virginity over.

121
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:13,603
I don't know if this is important
or not, but I have heard a lot

122
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:15,940
of very interesting chatter
around the shoeshine stand.

123
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,818
- My God, really? What have you heard?
- A lot of things.

124
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:23,114
Like, "can you believe it?"
And "the Parks lady boned Dexhart".

125
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,034
And "of course she did.
She's totally good to go".

126
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:28,427
And one guy was like,
"I wouldn't hit that".

127
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:31,706
The other guy was like, "me neither".
Then this third guy was like, "I would".

128
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:34,948
So I don't know
if that's helpful at all.

129
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,941
- Keep your ear to the ground.
- Okay. I'll just...

130
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,485
I'm not gonna let these people
intimidate me.

131
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,966
I'm gonna do my job.

132
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,212
I would be lying
if I said that I never thought

133
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:48,492
I would be involved
in an incident like this.

134
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,204
Except I always assumed
that I would be the politician,

135
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,089
and the man would be accused
of sleeping with me.

136
00:06:54,688 --> 00:06:56,812
And that man would be
the vice president.

137
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,144
And I would be the president.

138
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,872
You look good.
You need to put some tights on.

139
00:07:02,997 --> 00:07:05,182
Keep your neckline nice and high.

140
00:07:06,224 --> 00:07:09,611
Alexa Softcastle, Pawnee sun.
Can I ask you a few questions?

141
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:13,176
- Don't say anything.
- I'm not afraid to say anything.

142
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,573
I have nothing to hide.

143
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:18,474
I've never met him before yesterday,
and that's all I say about the matter.

144
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:19,917
This isn't the first time

145
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:22,090
that you've had sex
with a married councilman.

146
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:23,966
Who's saying that?

147
00:07:24,713 --> 00:07:27,563
- Some people.
- Okay, this interview is over.

148
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,162
Go home, lay low,
the truth will come out.

149
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:33,387
I can't.
I have too much work to do.

150
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,009
This department
is not gonna deputy-direct itself.

151
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:39,899
I think we can manage. Give me
your schedule and we'll cover for you.

152
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:45,019
I've made copies
of Leslie's daily work schedule.

153
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,741
So we'll just split into teams,
and each team will take...

154
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:54,222
Ten items...

155
00:07:54,566 --> 00:07:56,082
And we'll knock this out.

156
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:59,099
I swear to you, I never even met the guy
before last night.

157
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:01,024
It's okay.
I believe you.

158
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,380
- You do?
- Of course.

159
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:06,718
I think I know you pretty well.
That doesn't sound like you.

160
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:10,596
If I see that guy, I'm gonna punch him
in the face.

161
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,808
That's sweet.
Use your night stick.

162
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,351
Which meeting is this?

163
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:18,371
The organization
of local auditing systems.

164
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,274
- Kill me.
- All right.

165
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,242
First order of business...

166
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:26,377
Where's Leslie?

167
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:29,228
I gave her the day off, Paul.

168
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:31,576
- I thought that was best.
- That's good.

169
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:34,203
So you'll be making
the presentation then.

170
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:43,732
That kind of brings us
to what I wanted to talk to you about.

171
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:45,587
You know, my...

172
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:47,771
Army reserve unit...

173
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:50,951
We got called up to active duty.

174
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,847
I ship out in four days.

175
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:55,767
My God.
Where are you going?

176
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:57,185
San Diego.

177
00:08:57,461 --> 00:08:58,435
My God!

178
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,012
It's not dangerous.

179
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:03,773
It's mostly maintenance.
But I'm going for, like, a year.

180
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:05,409
Maybe 18 months.

181
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:07,435
And I was kind

182
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:10,813
of hoping that maybe
you'd want to come with me.

183
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:13,743
Like on a permanent-type basis.

184
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:16,521
I don't know,

185
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:18,844
It's kind of a weird question.

186
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:22,555
I mean, I joined
to put myself through college,

187
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,806
I'm just a desk jockey,
but it's rewarding.

188
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:33,386
So I guess I'm in love
with the army.

189
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:38,247
That makes a lot more sense.

190
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:40,999
I'm definitely in love with Leslie.

191
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:43,147
It's affirmative.

192
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,317
I know this seems kind of fast,

193
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,986
but I feel like
we got something here.

194
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:51,155
I do too.

195
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,820
You don't have to answer right away.

196
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:57,620
But you kinda do.
I mean, I need to know soon.

197
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,459
Are you gonna go?

198
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,839
This Dexhart thing is not making me feel
very attached to Pawnee, right now.

199
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,591
San Diego, jeez.

200
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:12,677
You could learn how to surf.

201
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,073
I know how to surf.

202
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,681
I took lessons when I was a kid.
I'm actually pretty good.

203
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:18,540
I bet you are.

204
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,962
I would Miss Leslie like crazy.

205
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,146
Sorted out that payroll issue...
this is done.

206
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:30,270
"Bring a case of beer to sanitation."
Why?

207
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:32,394
Let's skip it.
They can buy their own beer.

208
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,064
I'm hungry.
Let's eat.

209
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,449
Have you found
what you're getting Ann for Christmas?

210
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:39,132
I got her a pretty great
computer bag.

211
00:10:39,257 --> 00:10:41,357
Yeah?
That's a terrible gift.

212
00:10:41,503 --> 00:10:42,938
No, no, Tom, she needs one.

213
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:46,183
She mentioned it to me two months ago,
and I wrote it down.

214
00:10:46,308 --> 00:10:48,546
That's what's called being
an amazing boyfriend.

215
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,381
Have you seen Ann?

216
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,070
You know how hot she is?

217
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,688
Men give women of that caliber
speed boats,

218
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:57,638
private jets...
Not computer bags.

219
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,432
What should I get to her?

220
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,961
- Diamonds. Can't go wrong with that.
- Diamonds?

221
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:04,103
There isn't a woman
who doesn't love diamonds.

222
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,110
Even the super-left-wing chicks
that saw Blood Diamond and cried...

223
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,805
When they get one, they're, like,

224
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,583
"Yeah, bitch, gimme more
of them blood diamonds!

225
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,987
"Make 'em extra bloody".

226
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:14,231
Trust me.

227
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:17,700
We are here looking at a videotape.

228
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,276
This is back in April, 2005.
We're looking at councilman Dexhart...

229
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,311
Leslie, you should see this.

230
00:11:23,436 --> 00:11:28,377
And he's now about to shake hands
with Leslie Knope, the alleged sex toy.

231
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:30,802
For cripes sake.

232
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:33,335
Look at the way
she's smiling at him.

233
00:11:33,786 --> 00:11:36,636
And then almost unconsciously
touching her hands to her hips.

234
00:11:36,977 --> 00:11:38,512
See that? Right there.

235
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:42,266
It's like she's sending him a message
that she's ready for childbearing.

236
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:44,417
In a 24-hour news cycle,

237
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,521
the tiniest story gets dissected
over and over again.

238
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:51,390
In 2004, a kid from Pawnee
went to the Olympics,

239
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:54,015
and it was reported on
for over a year.

240
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:56,321
He wasn't even competing.

241
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:59,533
He just was going, literally,
to watch the Olympics.

242
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:09,442
It was way too easy
to get this guy here.

243
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:12,134
Councilman Dexhart,
this has gone far enough.

244
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:15,068
I want you to hold a press conference
and clear my name.

245
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,968
- No, thanks.
- Why not?

246
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,845
- What's in it for you?
- To be honest, being linked to Leslie

247
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:22,466
is a lot less damning
than the real story.

248
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,776
You're like a glass of whole milk.

249
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:27,269
What are you, Lutheran?
I love Lutherans.

250
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,730
Councilman, with all due respect,
get a grip.

251
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,134
If you don't hold a press conference,
I'm gonna tell the whole story.

252
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:34,527
It won't do you any good.

253
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:37,505
Take it from me, denying
only makes things worse.

254
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:38,919
Listen, I gotta go.

255
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,075
I'm expected at two different
maternity wards.

256
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:43,077
But before I go,

257
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:45,273
I'd be remiss if I didn't ask...

258
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,242
Should we?

259
00:12:48,494 --> 00:12:50,751
People already think we did it.
You've got nothing to lose.

260
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,670
- I'm very good.
- Get outta here!

261
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:53,979
All right, fine.

262
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:55,154
Shoe shine.

263
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,094
I've been thinking about
your gay boyfriend.

264
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:02,718
- I have got some awesome ideas.
- Okay.

265
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:06,392
First idea:
spray tan gift certificates.

266
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,273
Trip to Germany.
Germany is awesome.

267
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:13,899
And expensive.

268
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:16,569
Good call.
I didn't think of that.

269
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:18,308
Okay, you know how people say

270
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:20,998
that you should give gifts
that you would want to get yourself?

271
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:22,491
What would you want?

272
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:24,486
Indianapolis Colts
Reggie Wayne jersey...

273
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:26,240
Number 87, double-XL, home blue,

274
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:29,915
signed by Reggie right after he catches
a touchdown to win the Super Bowl.

275
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:32,834
Okay, never mind.

276
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:36,380
Hip-hop Abs dance fitness DVD.

277
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:39,436
We just received
these exclusive photos.

278
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:41,677
We have pictures
of city councilman...

279
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:45,084
Oh, my God!
I cannot believe it!

280
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,392
The big issue now is
who is this mystery woman?

281
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:52,313
She and Knope are standing
very close to each other.

282
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:55,135
And anytime you see two women
standing very close to each other,

283
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,735
- you immediately assume...
- Don't say it. Please don't.

284
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,451
- Lesbian.
- Oh, of course.

285
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:00,749
What?

286
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,950
It is a veritable storm
of information

287
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,951
coming in to the studios here today.

288
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:08,036
Leslie Knope, I would like Joan

289
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:10,539
to clear all of her guests tomorrow
because I'm coming.

290
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:14,471
If you think that you can drag us
through the mud, then you've got...

291
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:15,710
Yes, I'll hold.

292
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:17,987
It's unbelievable.

293
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:21,235
- What happened?
- Got a call from morning joggers.

294
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:24,773
Apparently sanitation
didn't empty this dumpster,

295
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,648
to the raccoons' delight.

296
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:30,267
- I thought raccoons were nocturnal.
- Not in this town, sweetheart.

297
00:14:30,435 --> 00:14:32,352
In this town, they're 24/7.

298
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,900
We can't have raccoons
for the Christmas thing.

299
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:37,175
They'll hunt the kids for sport.

300
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:40,184
Fess up, guys.
Who dropped the ball?

301
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:44,038
- "Bring a case of beer to sanitation."
- "Bring a case of..."

302
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:47,256
Yeah, this one's our fault, Ron.
And we will take care of this for you.

303
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:50,251
Okay good,
because I have to run a public forum,

304
00:14:50,376 --> 00:14:52,345
supervise the maintenance crews,

305
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,823
and teach crafts
at the senior center.

306
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:56,368
Simultaneously.

307
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,547
Joan, I just wanted to say thank you
for letting me be on your show.

308
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,841
I'm happy
to have the chance to clear my name.

309
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,290
Sure. I see you brought
your girlfriend for support.

310
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:06,965
- That's nice.
- What?

311
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,317
- No, she's not...
- And in five, Joan...

312
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,655
- She's a... we're...
- Four, three...

313
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,277
You've got it wrong.

314
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:17,208
Sex. Drugs, possibly.
Rock and roll?

315
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,517
We'll find out on Pawnee today's

316
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:21,638
exclusive interview with the woman

317
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:25,363
at the center of the Dexhart
sex scandal, Leslie Knope.

318
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:30,551
Leslie, my first question has to be
when did the affair start?

319
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:35,366
I spoke with councilman Dexhart
for the first time that night.

320
00:15:35,491 --> 00:15:37,790
We met for about 15 minutes,

321
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:40,670
and then I went home alone,
and that's the whole story.

322
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,464
Leslie, we all saw the tape

323
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:44,257
from four years ago,

324
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:47,552
and you were flashing
some serious "do me" eyes.

325
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:50,966
- That's just my opinion.
- I don't understand why I'm on trial.

326
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:53,433
You should be grilling
councilman Dexhart.

327
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,020
You know what,
that's a really good idea.

328
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:59,208
Let's bring him out.
Councilman, come on out.

329
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:00,690
Hi, sweetie.

330
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:05,487
- Why didn't you tell me he was here?
- I thought it'd be more exciting.

331
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,239
You look great.

332
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:11,952
It's like I'm invisible.

333
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,662
Okay, my name is Ron.

334
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:16,113
You don't need to know my last name.

335
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:19,859
Whoever wants to talk, go ahead,
and we'll be out of here in a tight 15.

336
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:22,603
I found a sandwich
in one of your parks,

337
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:25,728
and I want to know
why it didn't have mayonnaise.

338
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,560
What's so funny?

339
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:31,277
Kids shouldn't be allowed
on the playground equipment.

340
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:34,334
Okay, we've been over this.
If you're worried about swine flu,

341
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:35,651
use hand sanitizer...

342
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,278
I'm not worried about swine flu.
I already had the swine flu.

343
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:39,968
I'm worried about the turtle flu!

344
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:41,690
- The turtle flu...
- Turtle flu.

345
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,276
Turtle flu.

346
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,993
Joan, this whole Pawnee sun story

347
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,281
is "gotcha journalism" at its worst.

348
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,701
Honey, let's just keep our private life
in the bedroom where it belongs.

349
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,802
We do not have a private life.

350
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:58,081
Stop saying that we have a private life.
The fact is we never slept together.

351
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:00,476
And if we did, you would have proof.

352
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,335
And we would have seen it by now.

353
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:03,538
Councilman?

354
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:05,004
I can prove it.

355
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:08,174
She has a mole on her right buttock.

356
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:10,188
What?

357
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,097
That is a total lie.
You've never seen my butt.

358
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:16,683
What are you talking about?
He has never seen my butt.

359
00:17:18,474 --> 00:17:21,509
Well, I guess it's your word
against his.

360
00:17:21,634 --> 00:17:23,349
- I mean...
- That's right.

361
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:25,006
Fine.

362
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:29,261
- Here, why don't you look for yourself?
- Is this happening?

363
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:31,472
Wait...

364
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,116
there's no mole.

365
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,840
There is no mole!

366
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:36,888
This exclusive story...

367
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:39,634
There is no mole on Miss Knope!

368
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,142
I can't believe it.
This is utterly humiliating.

369
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:45,237
Councilman, care to make a comment
about no-mole-gate?

370
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:51,051
I really didn't think that Miss Knope
would pull down her pants on TV.

371
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,345
But since she did,

372
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,681
I will admit
that the rumors of our affair

373
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:58,975
are indeed false.

374
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:00,393
- Thank you.
- However...

375
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:02,435
I have no plans to resign.

376
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:05,483
Oh, great.
Okay, councilman, you're a class act.

377
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:08,437
I thought you did great.

378
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:10,812
When you get all feisty like that,

379
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:12,364
it gets my heart racing.

380
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:14,616
Like I'm on a stairmaster.

381
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:18,036
Except more like in a sexual...

382
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:20,955
context.

383
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,400
I can't go to San Diego with you.

384
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:29,464
My life is here.

385
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:31,716
My friends, my career.

386
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:35,610
I thought, with everything
that happened, you'd want a fresh start.

387
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:39,349
I know, I...
I really care about you, Dave. I just...

388
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:42,368
I love this town.

389
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:45,313
I'm sorry.

390
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,746
- You want your ticket back?
- No. You know what, keep it.

391
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,828
You may want
to come visit me, right?

392
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:56,893
There's a $75 change fee,

393
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:59,603
but I could pay you that,
or I could reimburse you.

394
00:18:59,728 --> 00:19:01,984
There's a lot of ways
we could handle that.

395
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:17,449
Sorry I'm late.

396
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:21,296
Honey, I'm so proud of you.

397
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:25,352
That took guts,
mooning Joan Callamezzo.

398
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,120
Thanks, mom.

399
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:31,052
- Is something wrong with the tree?
- No, nothing wrong.

400
00:19:31,177 --> 00:19:33,486
But it's almost 9:00. It should
have been lighted up.

401
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,030
We waited for you.

402
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:43,324
Okay, everybody, countin' down!

403
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:05,226
It's gotten a lot harder
to work in government.

404
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:08,493
Winston Churchill ever had to pull
his pants down and show his butt?

405
00:20:09,783 --> 00:20:11,865
But would he have?
Yes.

406
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:13,859
Now, could he have?

407
00:20:13,984 --> 00:20:16,408
Maybe not towards
the end of his life,

408
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:17,739
but he would have.

409
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,308
Because he loved his job.

410
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:34,589
Reggie Wayne!

411
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:37,237
Dude!

412
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,542
You remembered me complaining
about my computer bag.

413
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:43,163
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's perfect.

414
00:20:43,598 --> 00:20:45,599
It's way better
than the gift that I got you.

415
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,852
It's pacers tickets.

416
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:49,687
They're not even good seats.

417
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,314
- This is awesome.
- It's not awesome.

418
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:54,822
I actually got you a second gift.

419
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:58,571
You don't have to come
to this game with me.

420
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:02,085
You don't have to.

421
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:05,003
- That's the nicest gift...
- Is that good?

422
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,123
Thank God.

423
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:11,055
There's a bunch of messages

424
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,377
about a bunch of things
I don't understand.

425
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:34,188
Hi, this is Leslie Knope
in the Parks department.
