1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:01,669
That's me.

2
00:00:01,869 --> 00:00:03,118
I'm George MacFayden.

3
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:05,559
I wanted to talk to you
about the amount of snow

4
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:07,008
in the parks.

5
00:00:07,626 --> 00:00:09,844
I've been getting a lot
of visitors recently,

6
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,578
thanks to...

7
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,412
a stupid, worthless, new push

8
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:17,287
to make government officials
more accessible

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,670
to the public.

10
00:00:18,904 --> 00:00:22,152
There is a disturbing
lack of benches in Ramsett park!

11
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:23,771
I want to sit more!

12
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:26,630
And another thing I like

13
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:30,329
is the layout of the hiking trails.

14
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:33,062
I made this in one
of your pottery classes.

15
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:34,568
It's terrible!

16
00:00:35,628 --> 00:00:36,928
This is my hell.

17
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:38,697
- Feygnasse Team -

18
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:40,041
La Fabrique ::.

19
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:01,604
Ann's friend, Justin.

20
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:04,607
Of course. Hi.
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.

21
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:06,702
- My pleasure. Not a problem.
- Have a seat.

22
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:09,528
I should warn you, land seizure
isn't my specialty,

23
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:12,281
- Any friend of Ann's...
- Is a friend of mine.

24
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,014
That's my motto too.

25
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,759
So, what is your specialty?

26
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,830
Is it locking up the bad guys,
or keeping them on the streets?

27
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:23,000
Neither.
It's civil litigation, mostly.

28
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:25,768
- That's interesting.
- Can be... I've got this crazy case.

29
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:28,637
Have you ever heard of this product,
fire in a can?

30
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,394
I love those commercials!

31
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:33,211
If you wanna start a fire
but you have to do it fast, then...

32
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:36,472
You shouldn't buy it. It'll literally
burn your hand clean off.

33
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:39,372
It is an aerosol can

34
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:41,529
with an igniter and a trigger.

35
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:44,054
It's essentially a blow torch.

36
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:46,088
And, if you can believe it,

37
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:48,847
it was invented
to warm up baby bottles.

38
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,976
This is my colleague, Tom Haverford.

39
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:53,224
How are you?

40
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:55,472
You are wearing the hell
out of that suit, sir.

41
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:57,716
- Banana 2-button.
- Let's go into the conference room.

42
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,912
- I got everything laid out.
- We should talk later.

43
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,143
12:15.
You're early today.

44
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:06,252
April, there's no paper
in the printer.

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,302
So?

46
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:09,964
So that's the one thing you do.

47
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,125
Attention.

48
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,805
April, stop doing that.

49
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:20,306
Jerry told me to,
so it's super-crucial.

50
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,344
More important than that,
and more important than anything

51
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:26,522
in this God-forsaken world
is finding me an assistant.

52
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,294
You get an assistant now?

53
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,633
I've always been able,

54
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,974
but I've turned it down
cause it's a waste of money.

55
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,397
In the 8 years I've been at the job,
I've saved the taxpayers of this city

56
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,824
more than 150 grand.

57
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:39,864
But now, I need the taxpayers' money

58
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:41,912
to save me from the taxpayers.

59
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,689
Post this at your college.

60
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:49,196
This looks like an ad for nothing.

61
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:51,595
Please be careful with it.
It's my only copy.

62
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,687
You are very organized, Leslie.

63
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:55,968
Yeah, I am.

64
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:57,433
Thank you.

65
00:02:57,558 --> 00:02:59,180
I love that.
You got the coolest job.

66
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:01,115
Let me guess.
This is our park.

67
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,201
I want to know
everything about this.

68
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:06,103
These green things represent trees.

69
00:03:06,543 --> 00:03:08,105
I come in, like, two hours late

70
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,164
because I had to finish
watching Swimfan

71
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,193
because it was... on.

72
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:14,594
And everyone, like,
jumped down my throat.

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,571
Oh, man.

74
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:19,313
Can't wait till my internship is over,
so I can get the hell out of here.

75
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,397
You're all set.

76
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,003
Free of charge, of course.

77
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,824
Why don't you
sell your band's CDs here?

78
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:28,699
That is a brilliant idea.

79
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:30,669
I cannot believe
I didn't think of that.

80
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,004
I have been

81
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,686
writing a lot of songs
about shining shoes lately.

82
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,211
I tend to write about
what I'm doing.

83
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,429
Talkin' 'bout

84
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:42,165
Writin' about what I'm doin'

85
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,728
Now I'm singin' about
talkin' about

86
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:49,557
Writin' about what I'm doin'

87
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:52,098
Companies make bogus claims
all the time.

88
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:53,468
You're gonna be just fine.

89
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:55,590
Thank you so much.
I know you're really busy.

90
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:58,906
Please, it's my pleasure.
Least this stuff is interesting.

91
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:00,763
It actually reminds me...

92
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:03,827
Two years ago I was in Borneo,
officiating a wedding,

93
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,510
and this enormous
medicine man showed up,

94
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,832
and he was there
to basically tell...

95
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,543
Hey, kiddo.
How you doin'?

96
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:14,286
- Good. I haven't seen you in forever.
- So good to see you.

97
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,371
You too.
Do you want to grab some dinner?

98
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:19,093
I would love to.
I cannot. I am swamped.

99
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:20,720
You're always so busy.

100
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:22,596
Next week, I promise.

101
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:24,070
Hey, I'm Mark.

102
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,100
Sorry.
Justin, this is Mark.

103
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:28,143
- This is the city planner.
- Oh, my God.

104
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,798
- It's such a pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure.

105
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:34,602
Anyway, Leslie, I have to go.

106
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:36,443
It has been a super pleasure
meeting you.

107
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,918
I am gonna get into this,

108
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:39,989
and I'll get back
on Monday about it.

109
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:41,019
Great.

110
00:04:41,144 --> 00:04:43,117
- See you, Justin.
- Tom, good seeing you.

111
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:44,887
I've been thinking.

112
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:47,320
It has been a while since Dave left.

113
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:49,456
And I think I might be ready
to start dating again.

114
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,126
That's great!
Oh, my God.

115
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,501
I have so many ideas.

116
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:54,747
I was only with Mark for one night,

117
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:57,256
and then I was hung up on him
for six years.

118
00:04:57,492 --> 00:04:59,373
I dated dave for three months.

119
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:01,364
So if I continue that pattern,

120
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:03,460
I won't be over him for...

121
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,662
500 years.

122
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,599
What is your ideal man?

123
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:12,479
He has the brains of George Clooney
in the body of Joe Biden.

124
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:14,523
Interesting.

125
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,108
Okay, just off the bat,

126
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,402
there is a couple of doctors
I think you would love.

127
00:05:18,897 --> 00:05:20,154
What about Justin?

128
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,092
I feel like
we kind of hit it off in there.

129
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:24,375
Yeah, I don't...

130
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:27,131
I have to think about that.
I'm not sure that would work.

131
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:30,502
- Is there something wrong with him?
- No, he's really, really, really great.

132
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:33,292
And you're so great, obviously.
I just do...

133
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,334
I don't know.

134
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,985
But I will find you someone.
I promise. And he'll be awesome.

135
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,800
- I'm gonna go do it right now.
- Good, great. Yes!

136
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:41,849
Go, Ann, go!
Just one rule.

137
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,729
I don't want to date a twin.

138
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:46,006
'cause I've been tricked before.

139
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:50,387
Yes, I understand your complaint.

140
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,194
I have to go now.

141
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,466
Please. Thank you.

142
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:55,840
Ron Solo.

143
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:58,692
I want to help you
with your search.

144
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,003
- Why?
- 'Cause I wan to do my boy Ron a solid.

145
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:04,713
I know exactly what you're looking for,
and I will find you a reliable person.

146
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,056
Now, get out there
and find me an assistant.

147
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,356
- Did you get my messages?
- No, I been running around all day.

148
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,924
- What's up?
- I found the perfect guy.

149
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:24,286
But he's going out of town,
so he can only do tonight.

150
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:26,407
So I came over here
right after work.

151
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:27,930
- Is that his blood?
- What?

152
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:30,682
- Damn. Now I have to go back.
- Who is he?

153
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,957
His name is Chris,
and he's an MRI technician.

154
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:35,396
And he's really cute and he's
very passionate about his job.

155
00:06:35,564 --> 00:06:37,856
And I told him all about you
and he's really interested.

156
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,818
So dinner tonight,
and here's the info.

157
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,681
Thanks.
Wait!

158
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,817
How is he gonna know it's me?

159
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:47,811
I'll wear a red rose in my hair.
No, I'll wear a giant, red hat.

160
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:50,369
I don't have one of those.
What should I wear? It's gotta be red.

161
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:52,162
I'll tell him what you look like.

162
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,247
Good call.

163
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:57,042
I'm Leslie.
Are you Chris?

164
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,853
- Sorry I'm late.
- Don't worry about it.

165
00:06:59,978 --> 00:07:01,351
You look beautiful.

166
00:07:02,549 --> 00:07:04,091
- Let me take your coat.
- Thanks.

167
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,259
Sure.

168
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:07,020
Well done, Ann.

169
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:09,972
- I actually heard that.
- What?

170
00:07:10,974 --> 00:07:14,124
I went to Wisconsin for both undergrad
and grad school.

171
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:17,095
- Go, Badgers.
- Indiana Hoosiers.

172
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,580
No, Badgers.

173
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:23,083
It's not important.
I'm just...

174
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,362
glad that we could make this happen.

175
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,050
Ann told me
how wonderful you are,

176
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,298
and I just had to see for myself.

177
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:31,160
She's my number one best friend.

178
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:34,040
Kind of wish she'd told me
that you went to Indiana, but whatever.

179
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:36,349
So you're in charge
of amusement parks, right?

180
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:39,510
- God, that's exciting.
- Actually, it's regular parks.

181
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,420
Like swings and slides and stuff.

182
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,796
Strike two.

183
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:46,216
Isn't it funny

184
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:49,020
how these setups
are always just so awkward?

185
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:53,248
Hey, watch this.

186
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:55,693
I will now extinguish this candle

187
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:56,935
with my bare hands.

188
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,114
- That really hurts.
- Are you okay?

189
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,611
God, it looks so much easier
on the Internet.

190
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:09,573
God, I gotta borrow
some of your ice.

191
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:12,576
German?

192
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:16,818
All right, later.

193
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,501
Was that... Justin?

194
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,384
We are going to lunch tomorrow.

195
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,338
Great.

196
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,298
Did you guys ever date?

197
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:27,745
No, we never did.

198
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,344
He's just like...
a really amazing person.

199
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:31,824
Awesome.

200
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:34,447
Let's do this!
Marley & me.

201
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:37,184
- Puppies! Puppies, puppies.
- I know.

202
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:40,431
Let's... watch marley & me.

203
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:43,732
Brian.

204
00:08:45,522 --> 00:08:47,110
Technically, you'd be assisting Ron.

205
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:49,350
But Ron really doesn't
do much government work,

206
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,073
so you'd really be working for me.

207
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,492
I'm interested
in real world expertise.

208
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:56,230
I got a nightclub opening to go to.

209
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,038
Which tie do I wear?

210
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,966
I like the one on the left.

211
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:02,022
That was a trick question.

212
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:03,710
The answer is this one.

213
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:06,547
Tell me about you.
Tell me about your friends.

214
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,173
Be as superficial as possible.

215
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:10,573
I meet a girl at a bar.

216
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:12,321
She seems kind.
Could go either way.

217
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:15,191
I get her number. It's two days later.
What do I text her?

218
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:17,262
- It was nice meeting you?
- No, zack!

219
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:19,184
I don't text her,
"it was nice meeting you."

220
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,771
I wait eight weeks,
and I text her, "what's crackin'?"

221
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:24,898
So do you enjoy it?

222
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,922
Being an MRI technician?

223
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:28,110
Great question.

224
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,166
Someone steps into the room.

225
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,073
Imagine a mother of three.
Maybe she's a teacher.

226
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:36,157
She knows something's wrong,
but she doesn't know what it is.

227
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:37,611
She's scared.

228
00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:40,525
In less than an hour,
I know what it is.

229
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,499
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

230
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:46,000
But the best part
about being an MRI technician is...

231
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,542
I can see inside everything.

232
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:50,509
See that guy over there?

233
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,334
Imagine being able
to look inside his head.

234
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:55,178
I know.

235
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:58,683
Could look inside the steak
or this butter or this bread.

236
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,269
You can look inside...

237
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:01,351
anything.

238
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,271
If you look inside this bread,
all you're gonna find is more bread.

239
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,565
I don't know.
I'd have to do an MRI.

240
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,353
Anyway, it's good
that you found your calling.

241
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,820
I've never even had an MRI before.

242
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:13,844
What?

243
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:17,744
I don't know about this.

244
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,704
I'm offering you a free scan.

245
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:22,722
Usually costs up to $2,000.

246
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,666
I'm kind of spoiling you here.

247
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,102
I am a little curious.

248
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,498
Good.
'Cause, frankly,

249
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,924
I don't want to invest in someone
who has 3 months to live.

250
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:38,683
I'm trying to think of this
as an adventure.

251
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:41,258
Just getting right back
on that horse.

252
00:10:41,864 --> 00:10:45,414
Even if that horse is crazy
and want to peer inside my body.

253
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,228
- How does that feel?
- Weird.

254
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:50,353
Perfect.

255
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,910
You're not on your period?

256
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,635
No.
Does that matter?

257
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:56,022
Not for this.

258
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:59,743
It's gonna be a little cramped.

259
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:02,373
Don't worry, I'll be right
on the other side of that glass.

260
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,000
Just your basic assistant stuff.
Taking messages, wakeup calls.

261
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:08,543
Muscle milk runs,

262
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,087
condom runs,
bottle service to the Snakehole Lounge.

263
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,382
- That kind of stuff.
- What do I get out of this?

264
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:15,812
Connections.
Plus 19 grand a year.

265
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:18,167
Minus my 10% headhunter's fee.

266
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,865
I have to pay you two grand
if I get hired?

267
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,232
I have a job to offer.

268
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:24,672
In the immortal words
of Rob Blagojevich,

269
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,896
it's a *** valuable thing.
You just don't give it away for nothing.

270
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:30,524
You never told me where you're from.

271
00:11:30,911 --> 00:11:33,276
- I'm from Pawnee.
- Keep still, please.

272
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:36,113
- What kind of music do you like?
- Can I answer that?

273
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,447
Sure. Keep still.

274
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,157
All kinds.

275
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,582
It's very important
that you keep still at this moment.

276
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,371
I've told you that a 1,000 times.

277
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,457
Did you ever break your arm?

278
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,868
You can answer that.
Here, I'll turn it off.

279
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:52,439
I was on my bike,
and some boys were making fun of me.

280
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:54,381
I chased them and I lost control.

281
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,216
I'm surprised you can see that.

282
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,260
It was like three years ago.

283
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,263
I turned the machine off for that.

284
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,974
You never had any kids?

285
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,728
You've got a great oven.

286
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,772
- Time to go.
- You've got ample room in there.

287
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,858
Honestly, if you wanted to,

288
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,736
you could go triplets
right off the bat.

289
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:19,031
You got a big,
industrial-sized oven.

290
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:20,574
So we're done?

291
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,079
How's the date going?

292
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:28,540
Good.
We just finished the MRI.

293
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,066
I said that I wanted
to get back out there,

294
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:32,501
but this guy is nuts.

295
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,558
Sorry, Les.
I'll find you somebody else.

296
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:37,382
Don't let this sour you on dating.

297
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:41,061
No cell phones!

298
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:43,597
What was that about?

299
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:47,100
I set Leslie up on a date.
I don't think it's going that well.

300
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,352
With Justin?

301
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,813
No, this guy I know
from the hospital.

302
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:53,732
Why not Justin?

303
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,346
I don't really see them together.

304
00:12:57,206 --> 00:12:58,992
Leslie got out of a relationship,

305
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:01,531
so I didn't want Justin
to be like her rebound guy

306
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:02,799
or anything.

307
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:04,824
That makes sense.

308
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:07,412
Leslie is a notoriously cruel
and thoughtless person.

309
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,498
- Why are we talking about this?
- We're not.

310
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,210
You got a large brain.

311
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:14,595
Thank you.

312
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:16,683
No, it looks pretty.

313
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,929
Hang on.

314
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,488
That's weird.

315
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,427
- What? What's weird?
- Your brain.

316
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,728
- You see that shadow right there?
- Is that bad?

317
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:29,127
I don't know, I'd have a doctor
look at that immediately, if I were you.

318
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,022
Are you serious?

319
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,410
Wait.

320
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:38,605
It was like a smudge or something.

321
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:40,644
Crazy.

322
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:42,114
Thank God I was here.

323
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:44,741
Mark, I've never gone out with him!
I swear!

324
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:47,702
There's something weird
about the way you talk about him.

325
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,940
I don't know
there was definitely times

326
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:52,497
when we thought
we would go out someday, but...

327
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:55,252
That's why you didn't set Leslie up,
because you're saving him.

328
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,682
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

329
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,290
You don't have someone in your life
that you think,

330
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:04,417
"I don't know, if things were different,
maybe someday... "

331
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,847
You know what?
You can't save somebody for the future

332
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,558
while you're in a relationship.
Even I know that.

333
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:12,185
- Come on, don't go.
- I'll talk to you later.

334
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,631
And, by the way,
the dog dies at the end.

335
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,693
- Did you want to go back to your place?
- Actually,

336
00:14:20,263 --> 00:14:23,321
it was nice to meet you, but I think
this is gonna be our last date.

337
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,449
I get it.

338
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,492
You get your MRI and get out?

339
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,744
- This was your idea.
- Clever lady.

340
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:32,500
Guess I'm not as good a tech
as I thought I was.

341
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,708
Should have noticed
that you're missing a heart.

342
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,717
Good-bye, Leslie.

343
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:43,407
Right.

344
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:44,968
I drove us here.

345
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,104
- Goody.
- Do you mind if we pick up my son

346
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,098
at his basketball game
on the way back?

347
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,477
This is really good.

348
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,897
"Cease and desist, burden of proof"?

349
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,566
Check out paragraph two,
where I dropped the F-bomb.

350
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:01,568
"Frivolous."

351
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:04,362
Definitely have
the city attorney look at that.

352
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,406
But that should be enough
to do the trick.

353
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,951
- Justin. I can't thank you enough.
- It's my pleasure.

354
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,745
Maybe I'll see you around.

355
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:14,831
I would lo...

356
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:17,078
I'll see you.

357
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,289
Damn, he is all right.

358
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,885
Why don't you hit that?

359
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:30,354
Well, frankly,
I would like to hit that.

360
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:33,975
But Ann's being
a little weird about it.

361
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:37,229
When you were dating Ann,
did you know this guy Justin?

362
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,803
I hate Justin.

363
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:42,025
Ann was obviously into him.
It was so annoying.

364
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:46,112
I would say, in terms of guys
that she's in love with, he's up here.

365
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:49,783
I'm up here,
and then you're down here.

366
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:52,235
I just wanted to make sure
that I wasn't crazy.

367
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:56,164
So naturally,
I came to you for reassurance.

368
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:59,626
Do me a favor. Don't tell Ann
that we talked about this.

369
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:01,127
Will do.

370
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:06,466
You should be ashamed of yourself.
What you're doing to mark is not cool.

371
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:08,483
Why are you talking to each other?

372
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:11,197
You know what? Forget it.
I'm not getting into this with you.

373
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:13,890
- You did something wrong?
- No! I didn't do anything wrong!

374
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:15,600
Come here.

375
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:18,770
This isn't your business. You don't know
what you're talking about.

376
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:21,556
Actually,
I do know what I'm talking about.

377
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,048
Every time I sit around all afternoon,
playing video games,

378
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:25,443
wearing my slippers,

379
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,711
all of a sudden, I would start
to feel bad about myself.

380
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,408
- And do you know why?
- Didn't you explain why?

381
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,481
I would feel bad about myself

382
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:35,954
because I would start
to think about this perfect guy.

383
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:37,998
Any time
you would talk about Justin,

384
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,971
I didn't feel very important.

385
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,918
That was rough.

386
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,795
I didn't know that.

387
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,755
If you had, I wouldn't have left.

388
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:49,363
But you do know now,
so you have to choose.

389
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:52,394
- It's either me or Justin.
- I'm not gonna choose.

390
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,752
- Wait, I'm dating mark!
- Are you, though?

391
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,391
That close.

392
00:16:58,372 --> 00:16:59,308
I've done it.

393
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:01,703
I found your assistant,
and he's dope.

394
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:03,678
His name is Jean-Ralphio.

395
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:06,257
Big-T.

396
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,418
Mr. Swanson, two things.

397
00:17:08,543 --> 00:17:09,428
One :

398
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:12,198
It is an absolute honor to meet you.
Two :

399
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,868
Who is that hot intern chick out there?
Because, honestly,

400
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:16,283
daaaamn!

401
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,524
- Take a seat.
- Right. Here we go.

402
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:22,792
So, Jean-Ralphio...

403
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:25,378
You got him right here.
Leave a message after the beep.

404
00:17:25,556 --> 00:17:27,756
Why do I want you as my assistant?

405
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:31,718
For starters, access to the illest club.
And that's just for starters.

406
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:34,054
I will work for you.
I will be on you, 24/7.

407
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:36,560
I'll be like your family.
I'm here when you get here,

408
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:38,495
tucking you into bed at night.

409
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,352
It's not gay.
Do we have questions?

410
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,424
I think our only question is
when can you start?

411
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:45,815
Right now. Let's do it.

412
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,870
Thank you for coming in.

413
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,380
We will talk.

414
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:51,321
Cool.
I feel good about this.

415
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:54,656
You can hit me up on Facebook any time,
day or night. You know that?

416
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:56,534
- Take care, buddy.
- Boom.

417
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:58,703
What do you think
of your new assistant?

418
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:01,770
I wanna punch you in the face
so bad right now.

419
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:02,707
What?

420
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:08,046
- Message received. I'll keep looking.
- Thank you.

421
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:10,006
Bring me the opposite of him.

422
00:18:11,505 --> 00:18:13,426
- What kind of music is this?
- Rock and roll.

423
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,554
Fast, smooth,

424
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:17,995
handsome rock.

425
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,476
That band is blowing up right now.
They're number one on itunes.

426
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,720
I'll take one.

427
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:28,358
Your change.

428
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:31,653
You are amazing.

429
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,846
I like when you hang out here.

430
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,661
- I want to be your assistant.
- Really?

431
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,455
- You hate it here.
- So do you.

432
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,762
I'll make sure you don't have to go
to any meetings.

433
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,378
If anyone comes to see you,
I'll scare them away.

434
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:49,712
Wait, April.

435
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,436
If you had to choose
between these two ties...

436
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,909
You're hired.

437
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:56,719
I just figured

438
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:59,389
I might as well get paid
for being here.

439
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:03,992
I was just calling you.

440
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:05,436
Here.

441
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,352
This is a prescription
for Denise Dogan.

442
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:10,877
My God, I'm sorry.

443
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:13,007
I'm so out of sorts.

444
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:14,969
Here.

445
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,199
Porter's grill at 7:00.
Justin's gonna meet you there.

446
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:22,287
I'm sorry Chris was such a jerk.
You deserve way better than that.

447
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,706
If this situation is weird,
or if you feel weird...

448
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:27,167
It's not weird.
You guys will really like each other.

449
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,559
- Thanks.
- I gotta run. I have another stop

450
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:31,814
on the pride-swallowing tour
of city hall.

451
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:32,805
Go get 'em.

452
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,156
That's where I never find things.

453
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:36,556
Hi, Ann.

454
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:39,081
So I just set up Justin and Leslie.

455
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:41,806
And I'm sorry.

456
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,571
I rented district 9

457
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:48,563
if you maybe wanted
to spoil that for me tonight.

458
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:53,943
My God!

459
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,445
Dark ending, right.

460
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:00,341
I'm back on the horse.

461
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,660
And this horse is a lawyer,

462
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:05,331
so I'm looking forward
to riding him.

463
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:07,884
No, wait.

464
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:10,612
Ten months ago, she was an intern

465
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:13,482
who could give a c-r-a-p
about local government.

466
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,924
Now, she's our newest employee.

467
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:17,227
To April.

468
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:18,473
Cheers!

469
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,678
Jerry, come and celebrate.

470
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:22,644
No, thanks.

471
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,390
Everybody, let's get back to work.

472
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:29,646
Where are you going?

473
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,701
I want to talk to Ron
about the size of my desk.

474
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:36,152
You have to schedule an appointment.

475
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:37,946
How about now?

476
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,228
- Ron's not here.
- He's right there. I can see him.

477
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:43,834
I'll let you know
when he's available.

478
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,249
Atta girl.
