1
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:04,391
We noticed abnormal activity
on your credit card,

2
00:00:04,516 --> 00:00:06,258
so we need you to confirm or deny

3
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:08,998
- some of the recent charges.
- Okay, thank you.

4
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:10,750
$20 to Netflix.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,004
- $20 to Blockbuster Online.
- Both?

6
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:17,715
I needed all 11 discs
of gossip girl at the same time.

7
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:19,925
$120 in tuition

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,900
to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

9
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:27,808
They give you a little wand
and a diploma, it's fun.

10
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,836
- What'd you major in?
- Potions.

11
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:33,041
I'm gonna take you off speakerphone.
Go ahead.

12
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,328
Jessica Simpson
clip-in hair extensions.

13
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:38,140
I wore those once.

14
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:40,618
It was a money-back guarantee,
but I forgot to return them.

15
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:42,865
Man-Pillow,
the pillow shaped like a man.

16
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,660
Also something called
"bucket of cake".

17
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:47,091
You know what?

18
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,955
I think someone stole my credit card
so cancel it.

19
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:52,184
Do you wanna hear
what else they purchased?

20
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,456
Don't refund anything.
Just cancel the credit card

21
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:56,644
and we'll all go on with our lives.
Thank you.

22
00:00:57,638 --> 00:01:00,174
So...
What does a man-pillow look like?

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,650
Daniel Craig.

24
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:04,637
It's for my lower back.

25
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:06,155
- Feygnasse Team -

26
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:08,307
La Fabrique ::.

27
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,945
Episode 206
Kaboom

28
00:01:11,966 --> 00:01:13,246
mpm

Lestat78

31
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,290
My name is Keith,

32
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:28,077
and I am your friend.

33
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:29,662
Are you guys my friends?

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,331
All right.

35
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:33,580
Awesome!

36
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:35,877
It is playground time!

37
00:01:38,394 --> 00:01:40,923
We're here in Eagletown,
it's two towns over.

38
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:42,925
And we're all volunteering
for Kaboom!

39
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:46,785
A service organization that says
it builds a playground in a day.

40
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:47,983
High five.

41
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:52,143
I never trust anything that quickly.
That's why I don't eat minute rice.

42
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:55,599
So this whole
build-a-playground-in-a-day thing,

43
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:57,535
- That's just a slogan.
- Nope

44
00:01:57,823 --> 00:01:59,624
One day, 24 hours.

45
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:01,349
That is so incredible.

46
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:04,697
I work in parks, and I know
how hard it is to get something done.

47
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:06,824
Not if you have the kaboom spirit.

48
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:09,073
You can look at a problem
and you can either go

49
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:11,518
"This is a problem",
or you can kaboom!

50
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:14,373
Blow it up
and turn it into something great.

51
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,841
You literally kaboom the problem.

52
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:18,794
Come on, people!

53
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:21,074
I see more ground than playground.

54
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:22,925
- Kaboom!
- Don't do that.

55
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:24,939
One, two, three.

56
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:27,720
This is tough.

57
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:30,431
But think of all the kids
that will swing on this swing.

58
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,475
Fat kids, skinny kids,
brainiacs, sluts,

59
00:02:33,644 --> 00:02:35,720
the gay drama kids, goths, jocks,

60
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:37,218
the alternative crowd.

61
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:44,747
- What are you doing here?
- I'm volunteering.

62
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,775
I love to volunteer.

63
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,673
The key to volunteering?

64
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,266
A lot of pockets.

65
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:51,870
For putting all the food in.

66
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:53,881
The red cross has amazing cookies.

67
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,569
I go there all the time.

68
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:57,613
Meals on wheels was a bonanza.

69
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:58,918
Suicide hotline,

70
00:02:59,207 --> 00:03:00,879
surprisingly lame spread.

71
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:09,136
Thought I'd give back
to those less fortunate than myself.

72
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,804
- You live in a pit.
- Not anymore.

73
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,492
Living with the drummer of my band.
Living indoors.

74
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:15,795
Pretty cool.

75
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,687
Not to brag.
Kinda hard not to.

76
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:19,533
Anyhow, gotta go.

77
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,767
Me and an old Asian lady
are double-teaming some monkey bars, so.

78
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,426
I got a remote control
and I'm controlling you.

79
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,575
Go faster!

80
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:31,283
"Go faster, Ron's the master."

81
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,666
You have been officially kaboomed.

82
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,262
Look at you two and your big kaboom!

83
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,503
Great job!

84
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:43,781
I got gifts.

85
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,968
There you go for you.
And one more for you.

86
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,993
So you guys gonna join us tomorrow
in Muncie?

87
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:53,140
No, I wish,
but back to the real world.

88
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:55,425
At least you guys will be
kabooming somewhere.

89
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,532
Remember...

90
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,413
Take a man kabooming,
he kabooms for a day.

91
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,470
But you teach a man how to kaboom...

92
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,567
Kaboom! Kaboom!

93
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,821
I'm so pumped!

94
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,679
God, I could take on the world.

95
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,392
I could prep, like,
1,000 diagnostic tests.

96
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,014
- In an hour!
- That's the spirit.

97
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,328
There it is, the pit.

98
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:20,983
There's something
I wish I could kaboom.

99
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:22,079
Well, we are.

100
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:24,079
It's just a slow boom.

101
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,941
A slower, more deliberate kaboom.

102
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,075
Totally.

103
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,799
See you tomorrow.

104
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:40,686
You know what this mess is?

105
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,946
This is a list of things
we have to complete

106
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:45,399
before we fill in
the pit behind Ann's house.

107
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:49,144
You know what this is?
This is a kaboomer.

108
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,020
Jerry, did you use
permanent marker again?

109
00:04:58,145 --> 00:04:59,388
I'm sorry, guys...

110
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,169
Forget it.
Let's all pretend Jerry wasn't born.

111
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:07,590
And this is clean.

112
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:10,422
How do we speed up the process?

113
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:13,370
How do we kaboom it?

114
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,090
Rules, codes, permits, red tape,

115
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,348
I never realized how frustrating it is
to be in the government.

116
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:22,332
In my next life,
I'm going into private industry.

117
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:25,022
Maybe strip mining.

118
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,368
Everybody take out
their thinking caps.

119
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:28,859
And rip them up.

120
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,018
Then take out your doing caps,
'Cause we're gonna do something today.

121
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:34,740
I have a couple in my wallet.

122
00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:37,326
- That's what I call condoms.
- Come on, Tom. Focus.

123
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:41,455
How do we cut through the red tape?
How do we get this pit filled in? Ideas?

124
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:44,224
We need to cut through the red tape
and get the pit filled in.

125
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,082
Good.

126
00:05:45,252 --> 00:05:47,721
Everybody else needs to participate.
Come on, guys.

127
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,255
These suggestions
aren't gonna suggest themselves.

128
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:53,965
This idea better be good.

129
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,404
- I support you.
- Good.

130
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:01,642
You could petition to expedite
the architectural review board process.

131
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,358
Mark, buddy...

132
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:05,237
You're not listening to me.

133
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:07,706
I want to kaboom it.

134
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,865
- Can I talk to you outside?
- Sure.

135
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:13,223
Mark's gonna help me,
so thanks for nothing.

136
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:14,464
Good job, Ann.

137
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:18,328
So you really wanna get
this pit filled in?

138
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:22,220
- And we'll do whatever it takes?
- I am so sick of moving like a slug.

139
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:23,922
I wanna move like a cheetah.

140
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:27,096
Or a slug driving
a remote controlled car.

141
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,211
Something more plausible than that,
but fast.

142
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,297
- Would you break the rules?
- I won't murder.

143
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,548
That's good to know.

144
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:36,908
But it's actually very simple.

145
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:39,680
If you wanna fill in the pit,
just go fill it in.

146
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,600
Don't ask for permission,

147
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:43,209
ask for forgiveness.

148
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:45,691
I like that.

149
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:49,398
So who gives me the go ahead
to not ask for permission,

150
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:50,882
because...
Is it Ron?

151
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:51,968
It's nobody.

152
00:06:52,093 --> 00:06:54,567
It's you.
You have to be bold.

153
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,366
You wanna get the pit filled in?

154
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:02,899
Then go rent a bulldozer
and fill in the freaking pit.

155
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,543
What's up?

156
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:12,754
Say you had a friend who wanted to do
something good, but a little risky,

157
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:14,256
and she was kind of nervous.

158
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,342
And this friend is me.
What should I do?

159
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:19,554
You should do it.

160
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,235
And ask your friend to help you

161
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,368
because your friend
totally has your back.

162
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,392
- And that friend is me.
- You'll help me?

163
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:28,286
Of course, I'll do anything I can
to help.

164
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:29,486
Let's do it!

165
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,868
What are we doing?
Is it dangerous?

166
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:35,736
We're not gonna murder anyone.

167
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:38,831
It was crazy.
I didn't get a single permit.

168
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:42,256
Nobody stamped anything,
all I did was order a backhoe,

169
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:44,303
and it came with a guy who runs it.

170
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:47,623
I've never rented a guy before.

171
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:50,117
Wish I knew about that during prom.

172
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:52,497
There was a girl at my prom
who was known as the backhoe.

173
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:55,005
Mary Dunbar,
she'd let anyone massage her back.

174
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,802
I'm so excited we're doing this!

175
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,287
And without permission.

176
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,010
We're giving ourselves permission.

177
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:02,729
Look!
I had these hard hats made.

178
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:04,654
Check it out..."kick ass".

179
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,393
I'll take that one.

180
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:08,657
Oh, my God!
Ann, this is so cool!

181
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:10,094
Do you feel giddy?

182
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:11,647
I'm so proud of us.

183
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:14,150
Ms. Montegue, you ready?

184
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,827
I didn't wanna tell him
my real name, you know?

185
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:22,278
First speech, easy...
important moment here.

186
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,560
We are about to fill this hole now.

187
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:29,016
Not with dirt,

188
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:32,209
but with the courage
of a thousand lions.

189
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,929
And the solemn memory
of all of our friends

190
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:37,659
who have fallen in this cursed hole.

191
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,217
Dump it!

192
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:51,395
What the ***?

193
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,613
I'm okay.

194
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:08,661
That beeping was sure annoying,
but this is even more annoying.

195
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:10,039
I'll handle this.

196
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:12,791
The monitor is not a toy, Andy.

197
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:15,303
Anything is a toy
if you play with it.

198
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:17,171
Chalk that up to your concussion.

199
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,724
Well, the good news
is your cat scan's clear.

200
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:22,343
Cool.

201
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:25,597
Andy, I'm really happy you're okay.
Leslie was worried too.

202
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:28,933
We should've checked before
to see if you were... home.

203
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:32,500
I moved out. I had to go back
'cause I forgot my headphones.

204
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,584
And I layed down
on this really comfy tarp

205
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,107
I saw an old cereal box
I hadn't read before,

206
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:38,776
so I must've drifted off.

207
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,260
Next thing you know...

208
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,943
Dirt.

209
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,408
Scoot up for one sec.

210
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,754
And back down.

211
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,620
There you go.

212
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,589
That is perfect.

213
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:55,115
It's like I'm lying on a cloud.

214
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:57,003
This is awesome.

215
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:00,299
Ann and Andy, just like old times.

216
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:05,563
The pit works in mysterious ways.

217
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,521
I'm sorry about Andy,
but I'm not sorry about what I did.

218
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,512
What's my crime?

219
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:13,709
I got bold?

220
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:16,191
And a little negligent?

221
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:19,483
My office, now!

222
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:23,904
- Can I smoke in here?
- You don't smoke.

223
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:25,617
Just asking if I can.

224
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,213
Are you high?

225
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,012
I'm high on kaboom!

226
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:31,838
Don't ask for permission,
ask for forgiveness.

227
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:35,111
That's right, you never did
ask me for permission, did you?

228
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:37,104
I'm sorry to burst your ka-bubble,

229
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:41,224
but I just had my ass ka-handed
to me by the city manager,

230
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,716
and now this entire
department is ka-screwed.

231
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:47,970
Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry.

232
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:51,056
What the ka-*** were you thinking?

233
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:54,246
I would prefer that
she ask me for my permission

234
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:55,819
so I can say no.

235
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:57,343
I like saying no.

236
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:00,798
It lowers their enthusiasm.

237
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:06,405
So I brought you some clean clothes
that I found at my house.

238
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:09,491
My God, my sexy sweater!
It has a hole cut out over the bicep.

239
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:11,326
- Thank you.
- No problem.

240
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,702
No, a-cakes, seriously.

241
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:16,596
Thank you.

242
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:17,750
You're welcome.

243
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:26,592
What do you... what do you
think is happening right now?

244
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:28,218
A tragic accident...

245
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,211
reignited feelings

246
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,886
you thought were long dead
and we are finally back together.

247
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:36,518
Andy...
we're not back together.

248
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,646
You know that
I'm kind of with Mark now.

249
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,732
God, is that still happening?

250
00:11:42,205 --> 00:11:43,275
I don't get it.

251
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,403
- What does he have that I don't have?
- Are you serious?

252
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:48,660
Everything.

253
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:51,283
He has literally everything
that you don't have:

254
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:53,186
a job, a car,

255
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,912
a steady income,

256
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:56,038
an address,

257
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:58,871
a second pair of shoes,
table manners,

258
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,135
the ability to say
"tampon" without giggling.

259
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:05,439
Mark has his life together.

260
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,368
I'll get you a different nurse.

261
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,494
It's awful what happened to Andy.

262
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,994
But sometimes when you make an omelet,
you gotta break a few eggs.

263
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:21,556
What's the alternative,
no omelets at all?

264
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:24,056
Who wants to live in
that kind of world?

265
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:25,286
Maybe birds.

266
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,136
Then all their babies would live.

267
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,927
Hi, Scott Braddock, city attorney.

268
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,286
- I didn't know that you were friends.
- I never met him.

269
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:39,787
What I do know is that he could sue us
at the drop of a hat.

270
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:42,793
I mean, right now
he is the most dangerous man in Pawnee.

271
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:44,759
Is that all you lawyers think about?

272
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:47,525
Lawsuits, and laws, and legalese?

273
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:49,967
You can relax.

274
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,955
All I'm gonna do
is go in and just say,

275
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,325
"We're so sorry,
it's entirely our fault"...

276
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:58,403
You can't say any of that.
It admits liability.

277
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,895
You can't say "I'm sorry",
or "I apologize." It implies guilt.

278
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:05,607
That's insane, I have to apologize.
Andy was the victim...

279
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,859
- Can't say "victim".
- Of an unfortunate...

280
00:13:08,027 --> 00:13:09,903
Can't say "unfortunate"
and "situation".

281
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:13,532
- I can't say the word "situation"?
- No, it implies there was a situation.

282
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:16,346
Can I give him the pig?

283
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,287
Pig's fine.

284
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:19,871
Hi, Andy.

285
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,435
Got this for you.

286
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,223
Hope you squeal better.

287
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:32,957
This is my friend, Scott.

288
00:13:36,121 --> 00:13:39,184
Andy, I just wanted to say,
I am so, so, so...

289
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:42,894
filled... with emotions.

290
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:44,855
As any person would.

291
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:48,276
What?

292
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:50,069
No miming.

293
00:13:52,085 --> 00:13:55,073
- You were in the pit.
- We're not conceding that point.

294
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,451
You were in a place...

295
00:13:58,308 --> 00:13:59,995
we're both here now.

296
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:01,439
The government...

297
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,697
- We gotta go.
- What?

298
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:06,585
- Come on.
- Wendell Adams.

299
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:08,353
I'm Andrew's attorney.

300
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:12,251
- It's my only option...
- Andy, stop.

301
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,928
I've advised my client
not to speak with you.

302
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:16,928
He's suing the city of Pawnee.

303
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,016
You're suing your home town?

304
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,876
- Can we just talk about this?
- Leslie, no.

305
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:27,159
- This is terrible.
- Don't say "terrible".

306
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,543
Don't look back.

307
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,541
Andy, it's Leslie.

308
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:39,222
Hello.
Andy, it's Leslie.

309
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:41,797
Psych!
Leave a message after the beep.

310
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:43,403
Andy, it's Leslie.

311
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:47,324
Look, what did you mean
when you said it's your only option?

312
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,034
I think we should talk.

313
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,703
Without lawyers present.

314
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:54,483
If you wanna meet, just put
a white chalk'x'on the mailbox

315
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,406
across the street from city hall.

316
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,392
Or call me back...
just call me back.

317
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:01,811
Why aren't you returning my calls?

318
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:04,184
Is it because of your lawyer?

319
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:07,593
Hey, Andy, it's your aunt.

320
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:09,926
Your mom or dad's sister.

321
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,413
I don't know how to tell you this,
but...

322
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:15,557
your uncle has passed.

323
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,410
He's with Jesus now.

324
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:22,761
So we're having a memorial
in 30 minutes

325
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,204
at city hall.

326
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,457
Hey, free guitars at city hall!
Everybody run!

327
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:30,760
Because of a local disaster,

328
00:15:30,885 --> 00:15:31,885
you...

329
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,528
Andy Dwyer...

330
00:15:33,994 --> 00:15:36,449
must go to the evacuation center

331
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:39,637
at Pawnee city hall...

332
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,224
That was weird.

333
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,574
How long have you been there?

334
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:51,231
I promise that Andy
isn't suing just for the money.

335
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:53,314
Leslie, the man lived in a pit.

336
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,788
He couldn't find a place to live
on the earth's surface,

337
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,346
so he went under the ground.

338
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:59,948
You're dealing with a grown man
who thinks like a gofer.

339
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:02,527
I feel like
if I could get past the lawyers,

340
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:06,121
and find out what's really going on,
I could get him to drop the lawsuit.

341
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,838
Ann, is that you?

342
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,069
We need to talk somewhere private.

343
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,088
Baby, I'm back.

344
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:23,602
Thank you so...

345
00:16:24,925 --> 00:16:26,224
Why are you naked?

346
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:28,466
Because of what you said,
we're getting back together.

347
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:30,470
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

348
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:32,480
You should've heard
the sexy stuff she said.

349
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:35,535
I said "hey, Andy, it's Ann,
can we talk at my house?"

350
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,434
That's not how you said it,
you were like, "Hey, Andy, it's Ann,

351
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:41,138
"can you talk at my house?"

352
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:43,825
My God, you're such a baby.
Literally.

353
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,534
Big naked baby, put clothes on.

354
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,998
You know what?
I should've seen this coming.

355
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,019
Has he showed up naked before?

356
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,498
Anniversaries, birthdays, holidays.

357
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,339
- Good luck.
- Where are you...

358
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:00,008
None of your clothes fit me,

359
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,701
so I'm putting an apron
over the front stuff.

360
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,302
Is she gone?

361
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,643
What did you mean
when you said this was your only option?

362
00:17:08,947 --> 00:17:10,797
Well, I'm completely broke.

363
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:14,105
And my lawyer said it could be
worth upwards of $100,000.

364
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,566
I can't believe that
you're suing for the money.

365
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,611
I want Ann back, and she said
she needs a guy with a lot of money.

366
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,322
- That doesn't sound like Ann.
- I can't really do her voice.

367
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:24,657
But she said she likes Mark
because he's a grown-up

368
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,887
with a bank account.
I put two and two together,

369
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,325
$100,000,
I can probably get a bank account.

370
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:32,916
Sometimes I think the right thing to do
is to not take shortcuts.

371
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,940
I tried to fill in the pit.

372
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:36,544
That didn't work either.

373
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,135
Fine.

374
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:41,216
I'll get a job.

375
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,009
Ann will respect that.

376
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:46,875
I can make six bucks a day
playing guitar in the street.

377
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,127
- I can't make six bucks a day.
- Wait a second.

378
00:17:49,252 --> 00:17:51,888
I know I just said
that shortcuts are bad,

379
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:54,842
but I kind of just thought
of an awesome shortcut.

380
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:58,864
Mr. Dwyer, we're very happy
that you're dropping the suit.

381
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:00,276
It's really terrific.

382
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:01,987
I have my conditions.

383
00:18:02,184 --> 00:18:04,602
Never, I will not negotiate
with greedy street people.

384
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:07,077
Wait, Leslie, let's hear him out.

385
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:08,862
We planned this.

386
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,000
All right, what's it gonna take?

387
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,125
One...

388
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:19,110
I want that pit filled in, sir.

389
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:26,177
Is there a two?

390
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,751
A guaranteed starting spot

391
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:32,689
on the Indianapolis Colts...

392
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:34,811
inside linebacker.

393
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:37,791
We can't accomplish that.

394
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,277
I think that Andy seems like

395
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:43,636
he doesn't care so much
about the second one.

396
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:48,229
And he would be fine
with us just filling in the pit.

397
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,372
What do you say, Scott?

398
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,387
- Eventually, we're gonna fill it.
- Eventually?

399
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,870
I've already been
injured in that thing twice.

400
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:02,213
And I can fall in ten more times
by "eventually".

401
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,898
Every time I walk past that pit,
I'm forced to relive

402
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:08,970
the most traumatic two separate days
of my life and wanna sue you again.

403
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:14,186
Well, I hate to say it,

404
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:18,089
but it really seems like Andy has us
over a barrel here, Scott.

405
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,533
This is really happening.

406
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,738
I can't believe it.

407
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:30,450
Usually in these situations
a person says "pinch me."

408
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:35,121
Is that Andy?

409
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,586
Just one of his conditions
for the settlement, I guess.

410
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:42,761
He settled?

411
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:47,191
Gave up $100,000 probably.

412
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,653
Just for one thing.

413
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:51,763
The city fill in the pit
behind your house.

414
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:53,111
Why?

415
00:19:53,724 --> 00:19:54,783
Who knows?

416
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:57,936
Who knows why that gopher
does what he does?

417
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,000
You always hated this pit!

418
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:05,955
Good-bye, pit...

419
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:08,279
hello, lot.

420
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,491
How does taking risks make me feel?

421
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:13,395
Amazing.

422
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,257
Tingling sensation
throughout my whole body.

423
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,799
I feel flushed.

424
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:22,356
My muscles feel relaxed,
yet I feel awake.

425
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:24,652
Just waves of pleasure.

426
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:30,427
I wish there was something physical
that can make me feel this way.

427
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:32,954
You did it.

428
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,423
You thinking what I'm thinking?

429
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,856
- There's so much more to do.
- We're so close!

430
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:41,834
I'm gonna call kaboom! And check on
their availability for next year.

431
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:42,959
Great.

432
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:45,608
Information.

433
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:47,763
Hi, I'd like the number for kaboom!

434
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:49,946
The national playground
building charity.

435
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:51,983
I hope they can work us in.

436
00:20:52,311 --> 00:20:54,332
Sorry, there's no listing
for that name.

437
00:20:54,457 --> 00:20:56,023
What? Are you sure?

438
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:00,185
Kaboom! Is a word I made up.
It's not in any dictionary.

439
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:04,190
I trick people into building playgrounds
in empty lots in their neighborhood.

440
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:05,625
It's an elaborate prank.

441
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,184
For my next prank,
I'm gonna build a hospital

442
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,009
in a poor part of China.

443
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:11,843
They'll never see it coming!

444
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:15,346
