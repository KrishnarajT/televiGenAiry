1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,429
Thank you old Gus,

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:06,954
for brightening our lives,
our hearts

3
00:00:07,223 --> 00:00:08,911
and most importantly, our shoes.

4
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:12,289
This truly is a day

5
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:13,912
of mixed emotions for me.

6
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:16,449
I'm sad that old Gus is leaving.

7
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:19,362
But it allows me
to help Andy restart his life

8
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,715
as pioneer hall's new shoeshine guy.

9
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:24,548
I've been listening
to your boring speeches

10
00:00:24,673 --> 00:00:26,182
for the last 50 years.

11
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:28,681
And now it's time for you
to listen to one of mine.

12
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:33,636
You know, a day like this
makes a man reflect upon his life.

13
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:37,758
And I've come to the conclusion
that I've completely wasted mine.

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,235
And just for the record,

15
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:43,830
I never ever liked
being called old Gus.

16
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:45,948
I didn't understand it

17
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:48,242
when I was in my 20's
and I sure hate it now.

18
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:50,661
So go to hell,
every single one of you.

19
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:53,702
Screw Pawnee
and screw your damn shoes.

20
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:58,806
Old Gus is classic.

Episode 208
Ron and Tammy

24
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,650
mpm

25
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:10,332
lestat78

26
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:22,526
So, I propose that we change

27
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:25,414
our name, from the Subcommittee
for Pit Beautification,

28
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:28,059
to the Subcommittee
for Lot Beautification.

29
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,784
April, stop that.
Who are you texting?

30
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:31,827
You.

31
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:34,647
She's texting me.

32
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:38,751
Sorry you're bored.

33
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,005
Hey, everyone.
Hey, Ann.

34
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,049
Can I talk to you?

35
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:48,135
Fine. Tom, you're in charge.
Keep the momentum going.

36
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:50,346
- Keep these minds working.
- Absolutely.

37
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,558
Would you rather be able to fly
or speak fluent French?

38
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:56,352
- Donna, go.
- French.

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,063
I don't wanna freak you out,

40
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:00,939
but another department
filed a planning claim for lot 48.

41
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,691
Who?

42
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:07,776
Damn it!

43
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:09,467
The library?

44
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:12,618
Pawnee's Library Department
is the most diabolical,

45
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:14,912
ruthless bunch of bureaucrats
I've ever seen.

46
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,657
They're like a biker gang.

47
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,124
But instead of shotguns
and crystal meth,

48
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:20,577
they use

49
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,057
political savvy.

50
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:23,455
And shushing.

51
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,840
It's gonna be okay.
It's not a done deal.

52
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:28,675
You're right.

53
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,427
Thanks for pulling me out.

54
00:02:30,677 --> 00:02:31,804
I need a good plan.

55
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:33,931
I don't want to cause a panic.

56
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,892
News flash, we're screwed.
We got a big problem with the library.

57
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,750
Punk ass book jockeys.

58
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:40,774
Why do we hate the library?

59
00:02:41,064 --> 00:02:43,273
It's the worst group of people
ever assembled.

60
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:45,275
They're mean, conniving, rude,

61
00:02:45,444 --> 00:02:47,528
and well read,
which makes them very dangerous.

62
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:50,614
And they're trying to steal lot 48
for a new branch.

63
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:51,782
What?

64
00:02:52,727 --> 00:02:54,110
- On 48?
- Yeah!

65
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:57,496
I actually think a library
would be nice that close to my house.

66
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:01,500
But I'm not about
to say that in there.

67
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:02,793
A new branch?

68
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:04,624
I hate them.

69
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,335
We need to make contact
with someone there.

70
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,759
Does anybody know anybody
that works at the library?

71
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:13,470
Well, we actually kind of do.

72
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:17,505
The new deputy director
of the department is Tammy Swanson.

73
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:19,422
Ron's ex-wife?

74
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:22,286
That's terrific.
Or is that awful?

75
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,280
He hates her, but he knows her.

76
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,733
Everything's okay.
Or is it just the same?

77
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:28,735
You're thinking out loud again.

78
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,242
Am I? I am.

79
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:31,738
Of course,

80
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:35,234
that bitch of an ex-wife
is working for the library now.

81
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,578
That is perfect.

82
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:40,506
The worst person in the world
working at the worst place in the world.

83
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,208
I have to go talk to her.
Give me something I can use.

84
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:45,043
Does she have any weaknesses?

85
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,547
What do you mean no?
Everybody has one.

86
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:49,865
Not machines.

87
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,001
I honestly believe
that she was programmed

88
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:55,127
by someone from the future
to come back and destroy all happiness.

89
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:56,013
I see.

90
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,625
Just, I knew that you had
two ex-wives named Tammy.

91
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,393
So, I was hoping that there was one
that you got along with.

92
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:02,993
I hate 'em both.

93
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:05,125
On my death bed,

94
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,692
my final wish is to have
my ex-wives rushed to my side,

95
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,479
so I can use my dying breath

96
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:13,304
to tell them both to go to hell,
one last time.

97
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:15,333
Would I get married again?

98
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,397
Absolutely.

99
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,911
If you don't believe in love,
what's the point of living?

100
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:23,352
I'm just looking forward
to a thoughtful debate with Tammy,

101
00:04:23,477 --> 00:04:26,627
about the relative merits
of Parks versus Libraries.

102
00:04:27,295 --> 00:04:30,539
And in case something bad goes down,
I wore my sharpest rings.

103
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,758
This one will tear you up.

104
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,900
I'm Leslie Knope.
I called a little while ago.

105
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,228
You have a lot of nerve
showing your face here.

106
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,650
Excuse me?

107
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:47,564
You have overdue book fees

108
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:49,358
totaling 3 dollars, Missy.

109
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:51,262
That is so typical.

110
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:54,947
I should've known you'd use a low blow,
dirty pool, B.S. move like that.

111
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,296
That's why everybody hates the library.
Here's your 3 dollars.

112
00:04:58,623 --> 00:04:59,743
See you in hell.

113
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,288
I was just kidding, dear God.

114
00:05:03,456 --> 00:05:06,566
You did have 3 dollars worth of fines,
but I cleared them.

115
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:10,546
We government gals have to watch
each other's backs, right?

116
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,408
I know this is a trap
but I don't know how.

117
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:16,176
Did you talk to Ron?

118
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,596
Ron tends to exaggerate

119
00:05:19,764 --> 00:05:21,148
when it comes to me.

120
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,587
I swear, I don't have cloven feet.

121
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:25,561
Sit down.

122
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:29,577
Shine, shine, shine your shoes?

123
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,919
What do you say, sir?
Ma'am, shoeshine?

124
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:33,569
I won't look up your skirt.

125
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,364
My gosh...

126
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:39,455
Crazy! What are you doing?
It's me.

127
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,785
So, Ann, how you been?

128
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,997
Good. Leslie told me
you were working here now.

129
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:48,083
Just trying the rat race.
Chasing the cheese. Racing the rats.

130
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,418
To get the cheese.

131
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:51,795
Enough business talk.
You look ravishing.

132
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,883
- Not a lot of customers.
- Business is a little slow.

133
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:56,686
It is definitely due to...

134
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:58,551
the economy.

135
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:03,890
I've been hearing a lot of people
say that a lot, about a lot of stuff.

136
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:08,270
You want those shoes shined?

137
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:10,859
I'll give you a discount
because you're a friend of Ann's.

138
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,734
- I'm more than a friend of Ann's.
- Not for long.

139
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,569
- I'm sorry?
- I don't know.

140
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:17,874
At least, he finally has a real job.

141
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:20,103
When we were dating,
the only job he had

142
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:23,076
was sending audition tapes
to Survivor and Deal or no deal.

143
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,121
Hi, my name is Andy Dwyer,

144
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:28,266
and I would be a perfect contestant
for deal or no deal.

145
00:06:30,927 --> 00:06:32,586
I want it to be a perfect park,

146
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:34,212
with a state of the art,

147
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,298
swing set and basketball courts.

148
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:38,655
And off to the side,
a lovely sitting area

149
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,343
for kids with asthma
to watch other kids play.

150
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,436
If I'd had a park like that
when I was growing up,

151
00:06:44,561 --> 00:06:48,018
I probably wouldn't have gone through
such a prolonged mall slut phase.

152
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:51,806
That's the goal.

153
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:52,939
Listen,

154
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:54,482
you got there first.

155
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:58,506
I'm gonna withdraw my request,
as a professional courtesy to you.

156
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,692
Government gals, right?

157
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,034
Government gals.

158
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,641
So, you talked to Tammy.

159
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:10,324
What's it like to stare
into the eye of Satan's butt hole?

160
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:12,668
She's changed.
She's a different person.

161
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:14,086
It would be healthy

162
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:16,562
for you to get a sense of closure.
Look at Mark and me.

163
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,799
We slept together, talked about it.
We're friends.

164
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,343
You slept with Brendanawicz?

165
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:25,382
Tammy and I don't work.

166
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,922
We are oil and water.

167
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:29,393
Or oil and TNT and C-4

168
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:31,718
and a detonator and a butane torch.

169
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:33,730
Nothing good will come.

170
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:36,296
Wait...

171
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,072
She's here, isn't she?

172
00:07:54,593 --> 00:07:56,044
Good.
Good start.

173
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,771
Sorry about this,
but I really want to talk to you.

174
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:03,635
Couldn't we go have a cup of coffee?

175
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,098
Let's get this over with.

176
00:08:11,102 --> 00:08:12,144
It means a lot.

177
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:13,812
You're a miracle worker.

178
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,758
- Do you know what you just did?
- Yes, Donna.

179
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:21,153
I got two people to put aside
years of hostility

180
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,447
and open a door
to the possibility of friendship.

181
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,697
You were not here
when they got divorced. I was.

182
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:27,322
Those two are crazy.

183
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,286
And you opened the gates.

184
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:30,824
To crazy town.

185
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,733
Frankly,
I think Ron was acting like a baby.

186
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:34,850
A little bit.

187
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,626
What is he afraid of?

188
00:08:37,023 --> 00:08:38,464
Tammy's just a woman.

189
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:39,739
A nice woman.

190
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:42,174
You know, she's not a murderer.

191
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:43,792
She's not a dragon.

192
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:46,136
It's really good to see you, Ron.

193
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,883
You've aged horribly.

194
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:50,636
You...

195
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:52,642
son of a bitch.

196
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,687
- That didn't take long.
- My God! What's your problem?

197
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:57,481
Nothing's changed.

198
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:59,149
Who set the bed on fire?

199
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:01,365
I did, okay!
Is that what you wanna hear?

200
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:02,569
We're fine.

201
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:04,613
Take it easy.

202
00:09:06,152 --> 00:09:08,303
When you meddle
in someone's personal life,

203
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:09,677
it's just so...

204
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:11,124
rewarding.

205
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:24,174
Gun it!

206
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,092
Usual place?

207
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:50,722
Good morning, Jerry.
That is a beautiful sweater vest.

208
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:54,094
You look like you could use $20.

209
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,747
- Am I right?
- Why?

210
00:09:56,176 --> 00:09:58,249
'Cause you're a kid
and kids always need money.

211
00:09:58,589 --> 00:09:59,751
I need money.

212
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,753
That's why you're my favorite.

213
00:10:01,921 --> 00:10:05,468
When Tiger Woods feels invincible,
he wears a red shirt and black pants.

214
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:06,883
Good morning, deputy.

215
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:09,260
Ron wears the same thing
after he had sex.

216
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:11,012
I'm a simple man.

217
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,896
I like pretty dark-haired women
and breakfast food.

218
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:17,614
But this stock photo,
I bought at a framing store, isn't real.

219
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:19,270
Today I got the real thing.

220
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,984
A naked Tammy
made me breakfast this morning.

221
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,167
I should've taken a picture of it.

222
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:29,255
What's up?

223
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,381
My girlfriend's ex is working
100 feet away from my desk.

224
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,874
And he's been pretty clear
out wanting her back.

225
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:36,670
What do I do with that?

226
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:40,083
That's a tough one. Break up with her
and tell her to go out with me.

227
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:43,730
Good. Can I ask you another question?
Why did I come to you for advice?

228
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:47,590
You should play this one cool, man.
Be the grown-up.

229
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,089
Take the high road.

230
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:51,025
Ann's a classy chick.

231
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,763
If you get down in the mud,
you're just gonna lose her respect.

232
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,529
You've just made a surprising
amount of sense.

233
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,527
I've never taken the high road.

234
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:02,035
But I tell other people to.

235
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,017
'Cause then there's more room for me
on the low road.

236
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:09,815
So how did your coffee
with Tammy go?

237
00:11:10,114 --> 00:11:12,254
Leslie, I can't thank you enough

238
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:14,367
for sticking your nose
where it didn't belong.

239
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:15,611
I knew it.

240
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:18,070
So what did you guys talk about?
Old times?

241
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:19,927
I love talking about old times.

242
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:22,125
New times too.
But there's something about old times.

243
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:24,427
- You know what I mean?
- We didn't talk.

244
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:25,586
We made love.

245
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:30,282
Good.
Well, spare me the details.

246
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:32,127
- I'm just happy...
- It was so intense.

247
00:11:32,252 --> 00:11:35,013
I didn't know where my flesh stopped
and hers began.

248
00:11:35,181 --> 00:11:36,731
You know what I mean?

249
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,944
Our marriage was always
a complete disaster,

250
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,645
but we did have that,

251
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:44,485
the two of us.

252
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,588
It's like doing peyote
and sneezing slowly

253
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:48,901
for six hours.

254
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,771
- This seems like a private matter.
- She knows her way around a penis.

255
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:59,162
Well, I'm happy that it went well
and that you enjoyed your coffee.

256
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:02,832
I truly believe that everyone
should be friends with their exes.

257
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:07,308
I can't even tell you how many
of my exes' weddings I've been to.

258
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,505
They're reading
their old divorce papers.

259
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:17,981
Three fistfuls of hair?

260
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,640
That's not even possible.

261
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,353
Well, I'm too classy
to say I told you so, donna.

262
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:25,452
So I wrote it on a post it.

263
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:33,722
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off.

264
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:38,066
I mean you spend so much time
worrying about this park.

265
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,141
But really, who cares?

266
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:42,073
I care.

267
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:43,348
I care a lot.

268
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,124
It's kinda my thing.

269
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,261
But at the end of the day
what does it matter

270
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:50,580
if the lot becomes a park
or a museum

271
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:52,860
or a mega church?

272
00:12:53,342 --> 00:12:54,383
Or a library.

273
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:56,911
Nobody said library.

274
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:00,264
You've been talking to Tammy
about the lot?

275
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:04,001
I swear on...

276
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,269
a grave.

277
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,800
Oh, my god!

278
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,523
Tell me the truth.

279
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,108
Are you giving her the lot?

280
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:12,228
Not giving.

281
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:14,779
We have discussed a trade.

282
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,230
For what?

283
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:18,366
Excuse me.

284
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,334
More sex.

285
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:26,249
Tammy, can I speak with you
for a second?

286
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,432
I know what you're doing.
You don't care about ron.

287
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,786
You're using him to get lot 48
for your library.

288
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,565
Leslie, that's crazy.

289
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,163
And correct.

290
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,759
Why are you doing this?

291
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:39,752
Les, there are two kinds
of women in this world.

292
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,130
There are women who work hard

293
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,383
and stress out about doing
the right thing

294
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:46,310
and then there are women
who are cool.

295
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,423
You could either be a Cleopatra

296
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:51,975
or you could be an
Eleanor Roosevelt.

297
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,281
I'd rather be Cleopatra.

298
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:56,773
What kind of lunatic would
wanna be Cleopatra

299
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,548
over Eleanor Roosevelt?

300
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:01,591
Haven't you ever messed
with a man's head

301
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,393
just to see what you could
get him to do for you?

302
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:06,879
We do it all the time
in the library department.

303
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:08,749
You should come join us sometime.

304
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:11,085
I would never work
at the library department.

305
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:13,104
I'm gonna tell Ron.

306
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,165
And this little game
is gonna be over.

307
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:17,920
Yeah, you better run.

308
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,969
We're no longer government gals.

309
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,299
Look, we need to talk.

310
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:26,434
The planning department
reprioritization document?

311
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:28,936
- Calm down. I haven't signed it yet.
- You're gonna.

312
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,809
Because Tammy wants you to
and you do everything that she wants.

313
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:34,233
She made some really good points
about libraries.

314
00:14:34,747 --> 00:14:37,755
Are you even listening to yourself?
You're defending the library now?

315
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:39,706
The library.

316
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:42,074
Of all the horrifying,
miserable things in the world.

317
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:43,826
Some people like libraries.

318
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:46,828
I can't even believe it.
Some people like libraries.

319
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,623
Ron, she's in your head.

320
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:51,852
You said she was a manipulative monster
and you were right.

321
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:53,836
Tammy's changed.

322
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,239
Look me in the eye
and tell me that she's changed.

323
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:58,925
Look me in the eye.

324
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:03,804
I'm so screwed now.

325
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:06,094
- Her hooks are in my brain.
- Yep.

326
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,819
She has all the power
and I have nothing.

327
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:11,145
I'm so little.

328
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:24,787
Why don't you just break up
with her?

329
00:15:25,307 --> 00:15:26,577
I don't think I can.

330
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:28,674
We would just end up naked.

331
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,249
And I'd give her your lot
and my house

332
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:32,909
and God knows what else.

333
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:34,684
I have no control over my actions.

334
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,748
- Like she's crawled up inside me...
- God, ron.

335
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:40,216
I don't want to hear about
your disgusting sex anymore.

336
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,050
Okay, now sack up.

337
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:45,680
You are Ron freakin' Swanson!

338
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,431
Not around her I'm not.

339
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,435
It took years of intense,
focused hatred

340
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,700
to get over her.

341
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,325
And now I've undone
all that great work.

342
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,692
You've gotta help me to break up.

343
00:15:58,143 --> 00:15:59,986
I shouldn't get involved in this.

344
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:02,893
Now you don't want to get involved?

345
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,075
"It's just coffee, Ron. "
"She's changed, Ron. "

346
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:08,536
"I let Mark nail me
and we're still friends. "

347
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:10,654
I never... I would never
use those words.

348
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,679
I never said... Point taken.

349
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,627
Let's go dump your ex.

350
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:17,972
Thank you.

351
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:21,595
Would you like to be in the room
when I tell her

352
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,697
- or would you rather wait outside?
- In the room.

353
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:25,984
I don't want her to think
I'm a wimp.

354
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:28,486
Here are the ground rules.
Don't talk to her.

355
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:31,862
Do not make eye contact with her.
Don't believe anything she says.

356
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:33,846
Just sit there like a potted plant.

357
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:35,353
Can you do that?

358
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:37,116
Come on.

359
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,738
So how's the shoeshine game?

360
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,364
I'm on a break.

361
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:48,864
One of the many advantages
of owning your own business.

362
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:51,224
You know that's not
your situation, right?

363
00:16:53,636 --> 00:16:54,693
Listen, Donna.

364
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:55,833
Quick question.

365
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,252
Ann is trying to decide
between Mark and myself.

366
00:16:58,668 --> 00:16:59,921
.- }If you had to choose,

367
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:02,130
who would you choose?
Right now, on the spot.

368
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,578
I'm not sure.
Why don't you spin around for me.

369
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:06,385
Can we talk privately?

370
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,532
- Sure.
- Just out here.

371
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:16,715
So, Tammy, for that
and many other reasons

372
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,440
Ron has decided to end
this relationship.

373
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:24,787
Wait a minute.

374
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:28,491
Ron brought you here
to break up with me for him?

375
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:29,951
She volunteered.

376
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:35,373
Ron doesn't want to break up
with me.

377
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,806
What Ron wants to do

378
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,852
is leave here right now.

379
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:44,264
Go to the sleaziest motel in town

380
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:48,312
and wrap himself around me
like a coiled snake.

381
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,347
- No, he doesn't.
- I'm pretty sure he does.

382
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,519
See? He's completely over you.

383
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:58,707
Look, I understand

384
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:01,772
that this Ann situation is awkward.

385
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:04,765
But I like you a lot as a dude.

386
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:06,761
And I hope that there is some way

387
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:09,991
that we can both be mature
and maybe be friends.

388
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:12,117
Yeah, I doubt it.

389
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:14,856
I mean, I think
you're a cool dude too.

390
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:16,580
I like you as well.

391
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:18,936
But I'm still in love with Ann.

392
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:22,461
I couldn't have been more upfront
about that.

393
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:25,901
Is punching allowed
on the high road?

394
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,317
I'm sorry, Leslie.

395
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:30,394
She wins.

396
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:32,980
I can't resist her.

397
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:34,390
But, you have to.

398
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,106
Stay out of this.
This is our relationship.

399
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:40,313
He's my man and we have
something twisted and beautiful.

400
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,276
You want Ron.
That's what this is all about.

401
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,183
No, that's insane.

402
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:51,157
Fine, I had one dream, but no, no.

403
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,659
Baby, don't you see
what's happening here?

404
00:18:53,827 --> 00:18:57,070
She's manipulating you
because she's jealous of me

405
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:00,291
and the things I get to do
to your body and face.

406
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:03,381
I'm here because Ron is my friend.

407
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:06,881
And I don't like seeing my friends
miserable. And you make him miserable.

408
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,967
So, Ron, you can give her
the lot or don't. Whatever.

409
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:11,917
Just please...

410
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:13,846
find a way to be happy.

411
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:20,271
No, wait.

412
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:22,143
Ron, it's okay.
Just sign the thing.

413
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:25,691
It's not okay. You just put my needs
in front of your own.

414
00:19:25,977 --> 00:19:27,902
No woman has ever done that
for me before.

415
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,384
I'm sure that's not true.

416
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,238
You see the kind of women
that I choose.

417
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,661
Look, just wait for me downstairs.

418
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:35,036
If I'm not down in 5 min,

419
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:37,977
it's only because I'm receiving
a pleasure so intense...

420
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,460
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:46,962
Andy and Ann's family shoeshine?

422
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,756
I thought it had a nice ring to it.

423
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:52,843
Mark has been really cool about this.
And you're throwing it in his face.

424
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:54,867
But I still have feelings for you.

425
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,308
I said it.
What do you want me to do?

426
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,600
Not mention those feelings
to your boyfriend?

427
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,878
And you might wanna take
these pictures down.

428
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,003
Oh, my God.

429
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,951
- Take those pictures down.
- What? It's fine. What did I...

430
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:08,506
- All of it!
- I'm gonna.

431
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:09,631
Now!

432
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,447
- Give me the bikini one.
- The teeny one?

433
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:14,699
Bikini one.

434
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,649
- You didn't give her.
- Let's get out of here.

435
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:27,837
- Is part of your moustache missing?
- Yes.

436
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:29,839
- Walk.
- There's a push pin in your face.

437
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:32,154
Leave it in.
Can't you walk faster?

438
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,379
My legs are shorter than yours.

439
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,440
We had a good run.

440
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,920
Thank you for saving my future park.

441
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,817
It must have been hard for you.

442
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:52,562
You didn't kill Tammy, did you?

443
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,216
I'm afraid she can't be killed.

444
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:58,117
To exes...

445
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,912
may they always stay that way.

446
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:02,837
Tammy is...

447
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:05,791
a mean person.

448
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,294
Come on,
you can do better than that.

449
00:21:09,261 --> 00:21:11,757
- She's a great A bitch.
- There we go.

450
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:15,092
Every time she laughs,
an angel dies.

451
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,303
Even telemarketers avoid her.

452
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,833
Her birth was payback
for the sins of men.

453
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,434
But, you know,
the worst thing about her,

454
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:25,394
She works for the library.

455
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,700
She works for the library.
