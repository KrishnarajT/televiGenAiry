1
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:04,776
And to my wife, I apologize.

2
00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:08,398
All I can say is,
I wasn't just having sex.

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:11,574
I was making love
to a beautiful woman...

4
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,117
and her boyfriend,

5
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:17,038
and a third person
whose name I never learned.

6
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:20,017
Furthermore,
it was wrong of me to say

7
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:22,620
I was building houses
for the underprivileged

8
00:00:22,745 --> 00:00:25,123
when I was actually
having four-way sex

9
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:27,211
in a cave in Brazil.

10
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:29,550
I bet cave sex is in-sane.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,187
- Why?
- The echoes and the humidity.

12
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:36,408
In my defense,
it was my birthday,

13
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:39,060
and I really wanted to do it.

14
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:40,895
I think it's a real shame

15
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:43,976
when people focus
on the tawdry details of a scandal.

16
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:48,225
Personally, all I care about
is councilman Dexhart's policies,

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,904
not whether he was high
on nitrous and cocaine

18
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:52,790
during the cave sex...

19
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:54,742
which, by the way, I heard he was.

20
00:00:55,231 --> 00:00:57,318
One more shocking revelation
in a story

21
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,163
that just won't stop unfolding.

22
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,458
It turns out councilman Dexhart
may have also had sex

23
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:04,765
with a prostitute in the limousine

24
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,190
on the way to and from
the press conference

25
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,872
where he apologized
for having an affair.

26
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:13,715
Why does anybody want to run
for public office?

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,472
You're just asking to have
your entire life exposed.

28
00:01:16,747 --> 00:01:19,938
Well, if you're squeaky clean,
like I am, there's no problem.

29
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:22,478
You're married, and you hit
on women constantly.

30
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,365
Yeah, but I've never
sealed the deal.

31
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,245
Just window shopping.

32
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,713
You can fly to Brazil,
just don't enter the cave.

33
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:30,838
Up top.

38
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:55,803
You think that you're clean,

39
00:01:55,972 --> 00:01:58,042
but I bet that we could find
something on you.

40
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:00,834
I changed my name, which is legal,
and once in high school,

41
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,269
a girl beat me in a wrestling match.
That's it.

42
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:05,980
I bet anything I can find
worse stuff on all you.

43
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,050
Are you suggesting a game?

44
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:10,151
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

45
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,778
- I'm out.
- Not an option, Jerry.

46
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,781
- You're going down.
- Seriously, I don't want to play.

47
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:18,456
No, seriously, you are playing.
We're gonna nail you.

48
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:20,411
I will play, too.

49
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:23,292
If only to prove
that I can find more dirt on you

50
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:24,707
than you can on me.

51
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,775
That's why we're all playing.

52
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,295
Your desk is over there.

53
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,756
I love games that turn people
against each other.

54
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:35,488
You will never believe
what I just found on Jerry's Facebook.

55
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,689
A friend.

56
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:37,836
Burn.

57
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,680
Okay, again,
I'd really rather not play.

58
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,535
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

59
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,479
Trying to see who has
the least dirt on them

60
00:02:44,604 --> 00:02:46,558
in case someone wants
to run for office.

61
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,066
Well, it ain't Jerry,
that's for sure.

62
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:52,193
He's got a couple of 3-5-9s on him.
Public urination.

63
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,223
I don't like this game.

64
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:55,798
Just don't like it.

65
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,493
He's probably gonna go
anger pee in the courtyard.

66
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,785
You crazy park people,

67
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,551
I'm out of here.

68
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,478
Leslie, I'll see you tomorrow.

69
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:12,213
Tomorrow will be
our first official... first date.

70
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:15,012
- Roger that.
- Copy. Over and out.

71
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,552
Dave and I are going
on our first date tomorrow.

72
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm not nervous.
Why should I be nervous?

73
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:23,656
We're just two people
going on a first date.

74
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,658
There's nothing to be nervous about.

75
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,439
That was my phone.

76
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:38,171
What are you...
what are you doing here?

77
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,992
Just having lunch with Leslie.
What are you up to?

78
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:45,124
I'm looking for scandalous information
about my co-workers

79
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,289
for a game that we're playing.

80
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:49,959
My taxes pay your salary, right?

81
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:52,824
Cool.

82
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,010
And he looked up at me,

83
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:01,009
and he said,

84
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:02,805
"Thank you. You saved my life".

85
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:07,054
Hey, listen, I'm really nervous
about this date tomorrow night.

86
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:09,520
Do you have, like, a first date
outfit I could borrow?

87
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,372
Like, I don't know,
pair of cargo pants.

88
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:14,192
I wouldn't go with a cargo pant.

89
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,000
What about, like, a sexy hat?

90
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,760
- I don't know what that even is.
- Helping already.

91
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,831
Do you want to come by
after work today?

92
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,408
Sure, yeah. Tonight?

93
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,559
Several hours from now?

94
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,583
Or you could just come over now?

95
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:32,543
I think that would better.
Let's go.

96
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,341
What you doing, guys?

97
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:41,124
Looking for dirt on me?

98
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,414
No point.

99
00:04:42,664 --> 00:04:43,846
Give up now.

100
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:46,437
Oh, wait, there is this.

101
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:48,672
Everybody,

102
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,312
I bought a croissan'wich
this morning.

103
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,360
This isn't even a real receipt,
just a scrap of paper.

104
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,209
Taliban robes!

105
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,805
What? Where'd you get
that photo from?

106
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,552
Nice taliban robes.

107
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:05,402
Those aren't taliban robes.
That's from Halloween.

108
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:06,814
I was dressed like a jedi.

109
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,802
I'm sure that the voters
would be able to tell the difference.

110
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,092
Looks to me
like you're in the taliban.

111
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,002
Did everybody know
that Ron's ex-wife Tammy

112
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,629
is actually his second ex-wife
named Tammy?

113
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:20,864
That's right.
Ron has two ex-wives,

114
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:23,119
each named Tammy.

115
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,290
Both of them bitches.

116
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,763
Yes, my mom's name is Tammy.

117
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:33,839
What's your point?

118
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,400
Tom! That was a jaeger-secret.

119
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:39,266
You just breached a jaeger-secret.

120
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:42,530
Damn!
This just heated up quick.

121
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:46,867
- That looks great.
- Yeah?

122
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:49,479
Will you be wearing it
out of the store today, madame?

123
00:05:49,604 --> 00:05:51,764
I think I will, good lady.

124
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:56,168
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot.

125
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:57,543
if I've been married?

126
00:05:57,714 --> 00:05:59,046
- Have you?
- No.

127
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:01,945
- Then say that.
- But he'll wonder why I haven't been.

128
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,990
You know what?
I'm gonna say that I was married,

129
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:06,118
but the question is,
should I say that I have kids?

130
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:08,174
Guy like girls
that have kids, right?

131
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:10,809
What if I get drunk
and I talk about Darfur too much?

132
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:12,935
Or not enough?

133
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:14,311
Leslie, relax.

134
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:20,818
I have a few more questions for you.
"What if he shows up with another woman?

135
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:22,986
"What if one of my sleeves
catches on fire

136
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:24,631
"and it spreads rapidly?

137
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:27,882
"What if, instead of tic tacs,
I accidentally pop a couple of ambien,

138
00:06:28,007 --> 00:06:30,011
and I have to keep punching
my leg to stay awake?"

139
00:06:30,136 --> 00:06:32,015
Those are all insane hypotheticals,

140
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,081
and I promise you they won't happen.

141
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:36,631
They have happened.

142
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,452
All of these have happened to me.

143
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,212
No, there's more.

144
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:44,374
One time, I accidentally drank
an entire bottle of vinegar.

145
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:45,885
I thought it was terrible wine.

146
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:49,425
Once, I went out with a guy
who wore 3-d glasses the entire evening.

147
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,599
One time, I rode in a sidecar
on a guy's motorcycle,

148
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:55,428
and the sidecar detached
and went down a flight of stairs.

149
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:58,681
Another time, I went to a really
boring movie with a guy,

150
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:01,655
and while I was asleep,
he tried to pull out one of my teeth.

151
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,603
I literally woke up
with his hand in my mouth.

152
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:07,365
We went out after that,
but then he got weird.

153
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,260
I know it sounds crazy.

154
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:12,786
I'm a grown woman,
but I'm just not good on first dates.

155
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:17,223
You have a problem,
and this is how we're gonna fix it.

156
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,257
I know what you're thinking.
I wear an earpiece,

157
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:21,927
you sit at a table nearby,
you speak into a mike,

158
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:24,740
you tell me what to say on the date,
but let me tell you, it never works.

159
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:28,308
We are gonna go to a restaurant
and have a practice date.

160
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,971
I will pretend to be Dave,
and you will practice on me.

161
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:32,973
That's a way better idea.

162
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,505
Hey, Dave, it's me.
It's Leslie.

163
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:41,023
Hi, Leslie, it's good to see you.
You don't want to do that quite yet.

164
00:07:43,557 --> 00:07:45,194
Let's begin our conversation.

165
00:07:47,512 --> 00:07:49,362
What's on the note cards?

166
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:51,310
They're possible topics
of conversation.

167
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:54,435
Whales, parades, electricity...

168
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:58,290
- And the rest are blank.
- I couldn't think of anything else.

169
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:00,645
Leslie's in worse shape
than I thought.

170
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:06,774
Is she practice laughing?

171
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:15,469
The Danish call it
oppe og nede apparat,

172
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:17,559
which literally translated means

173
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,285
"the up and down machine".

174
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:22,660
That's a thorough history
of the teeter-totter.

175
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:26,202
Now I'm gonna talk about the local flora
and fauna found in Pawnee.

176
00:08:26,353 --> 00:08:28,681
You know what?
Just ask me a question.

177
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:30,656
- Just try to get to know me.
- Okay.

178
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:36,453
I can't think of anything to ask you.
I'm sorry. My mind is blank.

179
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,455
Ask me the first thing
that comes to you.

180
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:39,823
How big is it?

181
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:43,476
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

182
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,179
You ready?

183
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:49,904
Yes, I am.
Just give me one second.

184
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,655
Donna, let me ask you something.

185
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:54,562
Do you hate black people?

186
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:55,687
Excuse me?

187
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:57,725
'Cause apparently in 1988,

188
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,251
you donated money

189
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:01,504
to the presidential campaign for...

190
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,877
David Duke!

191
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:04,005
The KKK guy?

192
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,026
I got a phone call.
They said he would lower taxes.

193
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:09,820
How's it feel to lose so hard?

194
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,781
I'm sorry, honey.
Let's get coffee.

195
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:15,598
Re-Ron, you remember
my wife, wendy Haverford.

196
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,495
Of course.
How are things at the hospital?

197
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,706
Very good, thank you.

198
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:22,207
I just got a pediatric
surgery fellowship.

199
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:23,274
Nice.

200
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,398
We're celebrating,
'cause she's super rich

201
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,347
and super hot also.

202
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:30,340
- Okay, come on, Tommy. Cut it out.
- You're super hot.

203
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,799
Everybody else has to deal with it.
Let's get out of here. See you later.

204
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:38,717
I've established
a scientifically perfect

205
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:40,934
ten-point scale of human beauty.

206
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,978
Wendy is a 7.4,

207
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:45,358
which is way too high for Tom,

208
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,593
who is a 3.8.

209
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:50,709
Ten is tennis legend Steffi Graf.

210
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,118
You're late, and I can see your nipples
through your dress.

211
00:09:58,287 --> 00:09:59,829
What? No. Really?

212
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,998
In nursing school, we took
a psych course on how to treat phobias

213
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:05,503
with a method called
exposure therapy.

214
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:09,316
So like if you were afraid of snakes,
they'd immerse you in a tank of snakes,

215
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:13,445
so I am going to immerse Leslie
in a tank of bad date.

216
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,080
You're 20 minutes late.
I almost left.

217
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:17,856
I was...

218
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:20,391
dropping my niece off.

219
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,767
- What's your niece's name?
- Torple. What? I don't know.

220
00:10:24,656 --> 00:10:25,771
That's not a name.

221
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,315
I don't have a niece.

222
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:30,359
- My niece's name is Stephanie?
- Stop lying!

223
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,385
Look, there's bread!
You want some...

224
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:35,781
I got flowers in your soup.
I'm so sorry...

225
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:38,691
Just... I have to go to the...

226
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:41,220
whizz palace.
You know, Dave, the...

227
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:42,787
the place where you...

228
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:44,762
you know, the toilet thing.

229
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,933
It's a bathroom!

230
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:51,547
It's called a bathroom!

231
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:58,364
A little birdy told me

232
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:01,415
that you have
one unpaid parking ticket.

233
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,430
That's funny,
because a little birdy told me

234
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:06,917
that your adoptive mother
was arrested for marijuana possession.

235
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:08,771
Snap!

236
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,986
- What?
- You didn't know that, huh?

237
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:15,360
I didn't know I was adopted.

238
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:23,241
- I'm so sorry.
- I really didn't want to play.

239
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,891
- That was not my intention.
- It's not your fault.

240
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:30,586
He totally baited you
with that unpaid parking ticket.

241
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,807
Tom, could you come into my office?

242
00:11:35,021 --> 00:11:36,467
Tom-mato sauce.

243
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
Ron-tanamo bay.

244
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,095
Do be seated,

245
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:42,973
and congratulate me.

246
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,601
- For what?
- Winning the game.

247
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:49,036
I just found out, through some pretty
impressive investigating,

248
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,431
that your wedding was a sham.

249
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,933
- It's a green card marriage.
- That's crazy.

250
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,544
I was born in south Carolina.
These colors don't run, baby.

251
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:59,046
Yes, but Wendy was born in Ottawa...

252
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:00,073
Canada!

253
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:03,800
Her visa was set to expire
the day after you got married

254
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:07,929
at the county courthouse
in front of 3 strangers and no family.

255
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:13,170
We met in college.
She wanted to work in the states.

256
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:14,880
She couldn't get a permit.

257
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:18,342
I knew it. I knew you couldn't
get a wife as hot as her.

258
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,351
Seriously, Ron, games aside,
you got to keep this between us.

259
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:24,389
- Don't tell anybody, please.
- Come on. I'm not gonna turn you in.

260
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,571
Just admit that when it comes
to digging up dirt,

261
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,138
I bested you in this game.

262
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:33,091
- Say it. Say "I bested you."
- Fine, you bested me. Is that all?

263
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,861
- I'll have your wife tonight.
- What?

264
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,389
I'm just kidding.

265
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:41,572
Get out of here.

266
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,658
Why would you say that?

267
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,370
That dog was like my
best friend, and when she died...

268
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:49,414
Hey, Tiffany.

269
00:12:49,842 --> 00:12:51,917
Yeah, I definitely
want to see you tonight.

270
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:55,754
No, I can't really talk right now,
'cause I'm a date with this drip.

271
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:57,832
I can ask.

272
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,425
Do you want to watch
a porno after this with me and my wife?

273
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:03,762
No, Dave, 'cause you're disgusting.

274
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:08,800
- So it's definitely a no?
- Why you're being so terrible?

275
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:12,239
We're 2 people trying to go on a date.
It's supposed to be fun. It's a date.

276
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:13,751
You're right, it is.

277
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,856
Well done.

278
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,694
I had to get all medical on you,

279
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:19,247
but now you see
that even if everything goes wrong,

280
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:20,528
you'll survive.

281
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,385
You coy bastard.

282
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:33,709
You hate Ron, right?

283
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:37,129
- No, I think Ron is fine.
- So we're on the same page.

284
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:40,173
You got to help me take him down.
There's got to be something on him.

285
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:43,104
I'm starting to feel
kind of gross about this game.

286
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,954
It's not about the game anymore.
Ron has some serious dirt on me.

287
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,521
I need to balance things out.
You must know how that feels.

288
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:51,226
You got tons of dirt in your past.
Please, you gotta help me.

289
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,501
There is a man named Duke Silver.

290
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:59,192
He hangs out at a bar in eagleton.

291
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,652
He's an old friend of Ron's.

292
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:04,280
- Maybe you should ask him.
- Thanks, man.

293
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,161
I'm gonna dig up so much dirt,

294
00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:08,886
there's gonna be worms
all over the place.

295
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,748
It sounded snappier in my head.

296
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,875
Ann is so awesome.

297
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,197
I'm lucky to have a friend
who would spend a whole day

298
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,589
being so mean to me.

299
00:14:20,716 --> 00:14:21,516
Catch.

300
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:23,927
I don't need your dress.
I'm gonna wear my own stuff.

301
00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:24,867
Me power.

302
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:28,013
Good.
You're officially first date-proof.

303
00:14:28,182 --> 00:14:29,277
Thank you, Dave.

304
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:33,478
Listen... It is impossible
that he's not gonna like you.

305
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:35,496
He's gonna freak out
about how awesome you are.

306
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:38,331
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is. He's gonna love you.

307
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:41,839
You're cool, and you're sexy,
and you're funny, and you're smart.

308
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:44,273
Any guy would be lucky to date you.

309
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,448
- Yeah! Hell, yeah!
- Hell, yeah! I am awesome!

310
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:49,117
- You are awesome.
- Yeah!

311
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,609
And you are, too.

312
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:52,204
- Thank you.
- You are, too.

313
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:54,139
- Thank you.
- You are, too!

314
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,416
You're awesome.

315
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:01,181
Help, police!

316
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:02,515
Help! Help!

317
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,987
Look, I know today is...

318
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:11,978
today... And it's not tomorrow
but I felt like you should know that

319
00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:14,434
I'm awesome,
and you're lucky to have me.

320
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:16,728
And I think
our first date tomorrow's

321
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:18,797
gonna go awesome, off the charts.

322
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:19,982
Amazing. Up top.

323
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,218
All right, let's do this bitch!

324
00:15:24,756 --> 00:15:26,006
I'm not scared.

325
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,572
Can I come in?

326
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:29,896
'Cause I walked here
'cause of the drinking.

327
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:31,774
- I don't know.
- I do know.

328
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,189
I'm coming inside, so move.
Okay?

329
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,873
You make a better door than a guy.

330
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:43,005
This is gonna sound weird.
I'm looking for a guy named Duke Silver.

331
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,382
Yeah, he goes on in a second.

332
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:49,352
Ladies, ladies, ladies,
it's just about that time.

333
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:52,232
It's with the jazziest pleasure
that I bring out for you

334
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:55,301
my man, Mr. Duke Silver.

335
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:01,940
Thank you, Dwayne.

336
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,321
As always, it is a thrill
to be here during

337
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,570
this witching hour
with you lovely ladies.

338
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:09,792
Now relax
and let the Duke Silver Trio

339
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,451
take you on a little journey...
to yourself.

340
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:29,932
Ann was helping me,

341
00:16:30,316 --> 00:16:32,637
because I was panicking
about tomorrow.

342
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,760
Did I say something
to make you worry about to...

343
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:36,850
No, just...

344
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,727
the whole idea of first dates

345
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,373
just kind of freak me out.

346
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:41,646
Not anymore.

347
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:45,866
I can't even believe that I was
scared to go on a date with you.

348
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:47,611
You should be scared of me.

349
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,531
I think I need
to return this sweater.

350
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,576
I think it fused with my shirt
in the dryer or something.

351
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,245
I think that's
a sweater-shirt combo.

352
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,062
I think it's going
pretty well with Dave.

353
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:05,592
He wants me.
I can totally tell that he wants me.

354
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:08,114
I'm right here.
You know I'm here, right?

355
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,509
Did you see my bra?

356
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,764
I'm wearing the hot one tomorrow,
the black one.

357
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,767
Can I use your bathroom?

358
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,268
Are you impressed
that I know what it's called?

359
00:17:20,437 --> 00:17:23,055
- I ought to give you a lift home.
- Good. Well, in London,

360
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,682
they call the elevators lifts,

361
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:27,486
- you're gonna give me an elevator home?
- OK, let's go.

362
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,823
Let's go down to the pub...

363
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,447
- That's right.
- Get a pint.

364
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:35,070
We'll put our knickers
in the beatle records.

365
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,535
This is an English accent.

366
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:39,393
What I cannot believe
is Dexhart's wife.

367
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,270
I mean, how clueless can you get?

368
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:44,057
How did she not know
this was going on?

369
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:46,525
More importantly,
how does she stay with him

370
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,900
after all this?

371
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,407
Can I help you at...

372
00:17:52,532 --> 00:17:53,782
11:48 PM?

373
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,596
OK, here's the whole thing.
Here are all my skeletons.

374
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:59,808
When I was 16, I had sex
with a married woman.

375
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,476
- Right.
- When I was in college,

376
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:03,744
I smoked a decent amount of pot.

377
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,485
- Nothing insane.
- What the hell are you doing?

378
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,443
I'm trying to tell you that I've done
some stuff that I'm not very proud of,

379
00:18:10,813 --> 00:18:13,321
and I like you, so I would rather
you not find out about this

380
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,365
from anyone but me.

381
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,783
This was a bad idea.

382
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,786
No, no, it's... It's fine.

383
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,579
I get what this is

384
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:23,146
and why you did it.

385
00:18:24,915 --> 00:18:27,377
Is there anythingyou would like
to share from your past

386
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:29,225
to sort of balance the scales?

387
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:32,249
One time, this guy rang
my doorbell at midnight

388
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:34,885
to brag about getting laid
when he was 16, so I shot him.

389
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:35,886
Good night.

390
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,765
It's been a real gift making
sonic love to you tonight.

391
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:44,762
If you want more of the Duke,
both my albums are for sale here...

392
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,049
Smooth as Silver and Hi ho, Duke.

393
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,894
And look for my new CD next month,

394
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:52,119
Memories of Now.

395
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:56,167
So come see me, come talk to me,
come love with me,

396
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:59,158
and maybe we can
walk through fire together.

397
00:18:59,387 --> 00:19:00,649
Thank you.
Good night.

398
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:07,352
Duke!

399
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:09,065
Huge fan.

400
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:17,593
Look, Tom, I imagine you'll want
to tell everyone about this,

401
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:20,749
but I have worked pretty hard
to cultivate a certain authoritative

402
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:22,699
or intimidating image
around the office.

403
00:19:22,824 --> 00:19:24,684
- Can I get a picture?
- Sure.

404
00:19:25,168 --> 00:19:28,073
- Say, "I bested you".
- I bested you.

405
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,431
All right.
Thanks for lovin' the Duke.

406
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:33,360
Lovely photo.

407
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:36,071
- Truce?
- Truce.

408
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,172
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

409
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:43,656
You showed up at the guy's house,
in the middle of the night, drunk,

410
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:45,871
you didn't sleep with him?

411
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,064
- Should I have?
- It never hurts.

412
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:59,383
You... You left quite a bit of stuff
at my place last night...

413
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:02,472
purse and earrings and a shoe.

414
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,265
I am so sorry about last night.

415
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:08,118
On my list of embarrassing things
that I've done in my life, that was...

416
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:10,027
numbers one through seven.

417
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:13,191
- I understand if you want to cancel.
- It's okay.

418
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,610
You can make it up to me tonight
on our second date.

419
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:17,542
2nd?

420
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,657
Last night was our first date,
so that would make tonight our second.

421
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:22,458
I'm looking forward to it.

422
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:23,544
8:00?

423
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:25,370
8:00.

424
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:28,373
- You like dancing?
- Yeah.

425
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,460
- I don't like dancing.
- We don't have to go.

426
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,713
Well, we went on our first date,
and I didn't even know it,

427
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,366
a.k.a. I nailed it.

428
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,627
No fires, no ambulances.

429
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,941
Just good old-fashioned showing up
drunk at a guy's house late at night.

430
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:47,859
However, I want to be clear.

431
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:51,062
I have no plans to resign.

432
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:55,819
Is it weird that my feelings are hurt
that no one's found any dirt on me yet?

433
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,201
Hello!

434
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,448
I drove a riding lawn mower
through a Nordstrom!

435
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,540
There's video that I took!

436
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:06,327
It's on the Internet.

437
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,040
Nothing.

438
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,161
Jerry, plastic surgery?

439
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:18,244
I got hit by a fire engine.

440
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,009
You are so lucky.

441
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:22,230
How?
