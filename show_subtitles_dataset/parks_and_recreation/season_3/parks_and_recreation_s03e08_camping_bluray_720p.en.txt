1
00:00:02,329 --> 00:00:06,597
Gee wheeze, the Harvest Festival
was a real triumph.

2
00:00:06,665 --> 00:00:09,850
We had over 80,000 people
in attendance.

3
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:13,337
Which surpassed our wildest
expectations.

4
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:16,857
I would like to specifically
single out Leslie Knope.

5
00:00:16,942 --> 00:00:19,310
I speak for the Mayor,
City Council,

6
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,579
and all of Pawnee
when I say

7
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,347
we can't wait to see
what the heck

8
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:25,449
you're gonna do next.

9
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:27,151
Ugh.

10
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,652
Step on up here, Les.

11
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:32,490
Thank you.

12
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:34,158
Paul, are you okay?

13
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:35,693
Uh...

14
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:38,913
Oh! Oh!

15
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,748
- Oh, my God.
- Holy...

16
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,749
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:46,904
That was... the second
most awkward way

18
00:00:46,972 --> 00:00:49,340
a man has ever
grabbed my breast.

20
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:10,945
All right, guys,
everybody listen up.

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,114
Just a few notes about
our camping retreat tomorrow.

22
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,316
We're all gonna meet here
and leave as a group

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,735
at 6:45 A.M., promptly.

24
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,236
Why are we doing this?

25
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,438
Harvest fest is over.

26
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:21,739
We do not want to have
a sophomore slump.

27
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:23,307
This camping trip
is our chance

28
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,443
to think of some really
big ideas.

29
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,545
Why don't you just tell us
what our next project is,

30
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:29,146
and I'll go camping
by myself.

31
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,915
Look, I have ideas,
Ron, okay?

32
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,450
I have like a hundred new ideas.

33
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,351
But the point is,
the pressure is on.

34
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:37,421
We only have one chance
to make a second impression.

35
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,024
What portion of this camping
trip will take place outside?

36
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,392
- All of it.
- Pass.

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,627
Can't pass,
it's a mandatory work retreat.

38
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:44,695
I have a question.

39
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:46,330
What if we're
scaling a cliff

40
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,132
and I start to fall?

41
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,934
Can I grab onto your boob
for support?

42
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,369
No, Tom, don't!
Her boob kills!

43
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:54,338
My boob does not kill.
Paul did not die.

44
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,441
He had a heart attack which
required an octuple bypass.

45
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,544
Besides, the Pawnee Sun
said that my chest

46
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:02,997
saved his life.

47
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,484
How's the best municipal
department in Pawnee?

48
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,668
That's you guys?

49
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,187
Paul is going to be recuperating
for a while.

50
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,224
So the Mayor asked me
to step in as city manager.

51
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,459
And I, of course,
accepted immediately

52
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:18,262
because Pawnee is literally

53
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,464
the greatest town
in the country.

54
00:02:20,532 --> 00:02:22,633
Of course, I am gonna miss
Indianapolis,

55
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,236
which is the most wonderful
city in America.

56
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:27,438
I'm so excited to be
working with you all again.

57
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:29,723
And, Leslie,
I cannot wait

58
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,025
to hear your new big idea.

59
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,543
I want to hit the ground
running,

60
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,278
and your new mystery project

61
00:02:34,345 --> 00:02:35,980
is going to be
the hydration pack

62
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,147
that gets me
to the finish line.

63
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,349
You're all my little
hydration packs.

64
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:41,685
I'm sure I am not.

65
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:43,571
Ron!

66
00:02:43,655 --> 00:02:44,889
You are too.

67
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,724
Hydration pack!

68
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,962
Hey, you gotta hear
this hilarious story

69
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,364
that he's telling me...
tell her what happened.

70
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,500
- My identity was stolen.
- His identity was stolen!

71
00:02:57,836 --> 00:02:59,637
Tell her about the accounts.

72
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:00,804
They were frozen.

73
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,507
Frozen.

74
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,342
Bye, Kyle.

75
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,777
Where you going?

76
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:08,211
Oh, my God.

77
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:09,897
Heh.
How's the coolest chick ever?

78
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,931
Not good.

79
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,249
What do you mean?

80
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,018
Leslie's making us go
on a camping retreat.

81
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:15,853
That's awesome!
Camping's the best.

82
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,187
Camping sucks.

83
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:19,273
It's super-boring.

84
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:21,258
And you can see the stars,
which I hate.

85
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,359
They're creepy.

86
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:23,427
I love camping.

87
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:24,828
I betcha I could get you
to love it too.

88
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:26,096
Why don't I meet you
out there?

89
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,831
If you hate it, we'll leave
and go make out.

90
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:30,668
But if you love it,
we'll stay and make out.

91
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,536
Either way,
a ton of making out.

92
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,104
You in?

93
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,107
- Anne Perkins!
- Chris.

94
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,410
Hey.
I heard you were back.

95
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:40,544
Yeah.

96
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,879
I didn't do this
because of you.

97
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,747
Uh, well, it looks great.

98
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:46,634
Yeah, you look great.
Am I right? It's...

99
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:47,801
So good running into you.

100
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:48,986
You know, we should
get together soon.

101
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:49,987
I'd love to catch up.

102
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:51,088
Me too!

103
00:03:51,156 --> 00:03:53,090
Ketchup and mustard.

104
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:55,592
Ketchup and mustard,
I just was...

105
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:57,094
Oh!

106
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:58,479
That is so delightful.

107
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:00,981
I relish your wit.

108
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,736
Well, I salsa...
your face.

109
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,706
I should hate him.

110
00:04:08,773 --> 00:04:09,940
He broke up with me.

111
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:11,792
Well, there was an ex
that I still liked

112
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,043
after he broke up with me,

113
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,845
but it was really hard
to stay mad at him.

114
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:17,181
He was an amazing dentist.

115
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:20,484
You know, when he saw me,
I swear his face lit up.

116
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,086
- Ann...
- What do you think

117
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:23,304
"we should get together soon"
means?

118
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,089
No, do not read into this.

119
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,725
Remember, this is the guy
that was so upbeat and positive,

120
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:28,859
when he broke up with you,

121
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:29,927
you didn't even know
it happened.

122
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,428
Yeah.

123
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:32,997
Come camping with us.

124
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,099
It'll be really fun.
You'll be away from Chris.

125
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,633
You can brainstorm.

126
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:40,571
I'll give you first dibs
on s'mores.

127
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:42,072
Okay.
That sounds fun.

128
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,326
Here is our official
retreat schedule.

129
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,944
It divides our time evenly

130
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,712
between work and play.

131
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,364
Come on, everybody,
let's hustle.

132
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:52,482
Let's get
to the brainstorming.

133
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:54,618
Great attitude, Ron!

134
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,537
I just wanna get the work
over as soon as possible

135
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,522
so I can do some fishing.

136
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,323
Fishing relaxes me.

137
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,059
It's like yoga,

138
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,211
except I still get to kill
something.

139
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:08,699
All right, I...

140
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,685
Call this wonderful spot.

141
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,853
You didn't bring a tent?

142
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,139
I don't really go camping,
ever, Jerry,

143
00:05:15,206 --> 00:05:17,741
so I'm not gonna spend
$150 on a tent.

144
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,509
Just gonna sleep
on the floor.

145
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:21,562
It's called the ground
when it's outside.

146
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:22,646
Whatever. Why?

147
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,514
Do you guys do this a lot?
Camping?

148
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,650
I've never been before,
but I think I'm gonna love it.

149
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,686
Why am I gonna love it?

150
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:30,621
Skymall!

151
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:31,989
Come check out my tent.

152
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,891
I ordered a bunch of crap
off Skymall.

153
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,577
I got my TV, my XBox, DVD.

154
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,245
Awesome bed right there.

155
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,164
DJ Rumba's in the mix.

156
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,532
Ah, it's like
I'm not even camping.

157
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:45,235
This is actually a dog couch,
but it's super comfortable.

158
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,141
It's really important to me
that April loves camping,

159
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,877
so I went ahead
and set up the ultimate

160
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:56,080
campsite love nest.

161
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,882
Complete with beautiful
starlight.

162
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,883
You got champagne.

163
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:01,351
Also, rose petals.

164
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:04,521
As you can see,
they smell terrific.

165
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,657
We need big ideas,
and we need 'em now.

166
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,025
Who wants to go first?

167
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,694
I propose that we take
all the money we made

168
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,362
from the Harvest Festival

169
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,431
and return it
to the citizens.

170
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,666
So how much would
that be per person?

171
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:18,435
About 83 cents.

172
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,204
Per household.

173
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,588
Before postage.

174
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,258
Are we done?

175
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,076
What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne,

176
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:27,294
and Drake
all have in common?

177
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:28,645
Oh, I know this one.

178
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:30,447
They are all rap-pists.

179
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,083
Oh, my God,
they're Rappers, Jerry!

180
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:35,219
What they have in common
is none of them

181
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,687
have ever
performed in Pawnee.

182
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:37,754
Why?

183
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:39,690
Because we don't have

184
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,775
an adequate concert venue.

185
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,261
Until now.

186
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:45,762
The Pawnee Amphitheater!

187
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:47,765
How much would that cost?

188
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:49,666
Not that much.
$200, $300 million.

189
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,568
- Right.
- Great.

190
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,104
Luxury Dog Park.

191
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:56,273
Do you wanna
tell us anymore?

192
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:57,975
Poodles only.

193
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,076
No pooping.

194
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:02,112
Hey. Where are you?

195
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:03,964
I'm here.
Where are you?

196
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,799
We're inside
the main entrance.

197
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,085
Near the sign that says
Pawnee campground.

198
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:09,786
Oh...

199
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:11,255
I'm in a totally
different place.

200
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,923
That's why we can't
see each other.

201
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,424
My God, Andy.

202
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:15,959
I don't even
want to be here.

203
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,294
The air is too fresh.

204
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,296
It's disgusting.
I can't breathe.

205
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:21,498
There's a brook somewhere
that won't stop babbling.

206
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,800
Shut up!

207
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,401
Sweetheart,
just hold tight.

208
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:26,403
And, uh, I'll be there.

209
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:28,338
Well, April is right here.

210
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,842
And I... Am
down here somewhere.

211
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,861
How 'bout we just
invest the money?

212
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:35,579
Make 4% a year.

213
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,480
You know, set up a nice little
nest egg for the city.

214
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:38,582
What do you think?

215
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,834
Great idea.
Thanks, white Urkel.

216
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,220
All right, maybe it's not
the sexiest idea, Todd,

217
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:44,788
but it's smart.

218
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,123
What are you even
still doing here?

219
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:47,591
Harvest Festival is over.

220
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,293
Shouldn't you be back
in Indianapolis?

221
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,762
Ben helped us launch
the Harvest Festival,

222
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,514
and he knows how
Chris's mind works,

223
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,232
and he's a valuable asset
to the team.

224
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,383
Thank you.

225
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:58,502
April has not presented
her idea... April.

226
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,536
I didn't come up
with anything.

227
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,021
- Why?
- Because!

228
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,139
I know that whatever
we come up with

229
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,273
isn't gonna be
good enough anyway.

230
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:04,674
We're just gonna
go with your idea.

231
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,343
She's got a point.

232
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:07,945
Leslie, just tell us
what your idea is,

233
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,512
so I can go back
to the thunderdome.

234
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:11,198
That's what
I'm calling my tent.

235
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,016
I am really disappointed
in all of you.

236
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:15,235
You know, the whole town
is looking at us right now,

237
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,421
and you're
letting them down.

238
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:19,289
Take an hour,
go clear your heads,

239
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:22,209
and see if you can come up with
a real idea that we can use.

240
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,760
And also see
if you're interested

241
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:25,062
in contributing
to this department.

242
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,664
And after that,
I will tell you my idea.

243
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:34,338
Wow, you really
let 'em have it.

244
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:35,439
Well, I had no choice.

245
00:08:35,506 --> 00:08:36,540
I didn't want to tell them
my idea.

246
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:37,674
Why not?

247
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:39,543
Because I don't have one.

248
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,878
I don't have an idea, Ann.

249
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,778
I'm so screwed, Ann.

250
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:47,178
The meeting is tomorrow and
I don't have anything.

251
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:49,678
Why don't you build the Park
on the lot behind my house?

252
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:52,266
Chris wants the new project
to generate revenue.

253
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:54,151
What about those binders
in your office?

254
00:08:54,235 --> 00:08:55,369
They're filled
with small ideas!

255
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:57,020
We need a big, juicy idea.

256
00:08:57,105 --> 00:09:00,140
I'm so desperate, I even
brought in my "Dream Journal",

257
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:02,192
hoping it would inspire me.

258
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:05,312
"I married Alf,
and we're pretty happy."

259
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,781
- Sounds nice.
- It was.

260
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:08,916
Okay, listen to me.

261
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,500
You are smart and creative

262
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:12,502
and talented,
and you're gonna be fine.

263
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:13,871
You're probably right.

264
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:17,190
I just need an hour, and...
and it'll come to me.

265
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:22,846
Hello?

266
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,464
Andy, you have to save me.

267
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:25,999
I'm camping with
people I work with.

268
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,184
Hello, April?

269
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:28,735
Hello?

270
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,004
Walk around in circles,
like I am,

271
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:33,907
help triangulate
the phone call.

272
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,142
Hello?

273
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:38,979
Hang on, I'm gonna try
to get to higher ground.

274
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:40,314
Agh!

275
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,982
Ow, I found some thorns.

276
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:45,619
I mean, yes,
my daughter might think

277
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,021
she is old enough to be sexually
active with her boyfriend.

278
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:49,623
But I'm sorry, 16.

279
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:51,925
That... that just seems too young
to be on birth control.

280
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,361
You know, I was 24
when Gayle took my virginity.

281
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,064
What's say we just
stand here

282
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,932
in silence.

283
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,335
And think of ideas...

284
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,903
for projects.

285
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:04,371
You know
what I should do?

286
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:07,540
I should lead
a teen abstinence workshop.

287
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,729
That might be
incredibly effective.

288
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:24,992
Hey, Tom.

289
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:28,362
One second, I'm just in
the middle of a head massage.

290
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:30,397
That's a good stopping point.

291
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:32,416
- What's up?
- Uh...

292
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,234
You wanna bounce some ideas
off each other?

293
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:35,535
Here's a better idea.

294
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,004
How 'bout I bounce my way
over to my dog couch

295
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,755
and watch a little season six
of Top Chef?

296
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,208
- All right.
- I know Leslie seems upset.

297
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,210
But the truth is, she's better
than us at this stuff

298
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:44,611
by a thousand miles.

299
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,595
So there's really no point.

300
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,047
Care for some fondue?

301
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:49,216
Yeah.

302
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,601
Hey, how do you
afford all this stuff?

303
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:53,270
I just return it
the next day

304
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:54,554
and claim it was defective.

305
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:55,772
The key is crying a lot.

306
00:10:55,857 --> 00:10:57,457
No one likes to hear
a grown man cry.

307
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:58,976
And then my hand accidentally

308
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,560
went in the panini press!

309
00:11:01,863 --> 00:11:03,280
Hey, you wanna
go for a walk?

310
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,314
Yeah.

311
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,702
Wow, the sky
is really beautiful.

312
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,971
It's pollution from
the sweetums factory.

313
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,972
It's gorgeous.

314
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,074
But is it worth the asthma?

315
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:15,776
No.

316
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,444
Ben, this new project idea,

317
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:18,779
it's not really a big deal.

318
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,630
I'm probably making
too much out of it.

319
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:22,416
No, no, no.
It's really big.

320
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:23,984
I mean, you've got
everyone's attention

321
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:25,085
with the Harvest Festival,

322
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:26,420
and now you're gonna
seal the deal.

323
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:27,971
It's the chance
you've been waiting for.

324
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:30,623
Well, what if the festival
was, like, a high point for me,

325
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:32,926
and I never do anything
better than that?

326
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:35,429
Then you wouldn't be
Leslie Knope.

327
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:38,365
So I have to keep thinking
about good ideas

328
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,667
all the time,
or I'm no longer myself?

329
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:41,902
No, no, no.
Not at all.

330
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:44,071
I... I've just honestly
never met someone

331
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,372
who works as hard
as you do.

332
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,858
I mean, you're like
the energizer bunny

333
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:50,610
of city government.

334
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:55,382
And when she looked
in the back of her car,

335
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,486
she saw that, even though
it was her own private property,

336
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:03,056
she would be forced
to take it in...

337
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:04,925
for a state inspection!

338
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:06,259
Okay, guys, listen up.

339
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,129
- What was that?
- That was me talking.

340
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,497
No, I heard it too.

341
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:11,515
Andy?

342
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,849
If that's a coyote,

343
00:12:12,934 --> 00:12:14,634
someone needs to pick me up
off the ground, now.

344
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:16,403
Oh, my God! Oh, oh!

345
00:12:16,471 --> 00:12:18,605
- Hey, guys.
- What are you doing here?

346
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:20,023
I was just out
for my nighttime run,

347
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:22,142
and I thought, "why not go
visit the Parks Department?"

348
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,210
How's everything going here?

349
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:25,479
Super great.
Really well.

350
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,481
We have a great idea.

351
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:28,848
Ooh, tell me now!

352
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,183
While I sit on this Boulder.

353
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:31,518
I'm much more receptive
to new ideas

354
00:12:31,569 --> 00:12:33,353
when my heart rate
is still elevated.

355
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:36,656
Chris, do you want to maybe
just talk for a minute

356
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,024
and let them work.

357
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,210
Oh! Oh, sure.

358
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,469
What was that?
What was that?

359
00:12:52,673 --> 00:12:54,558
Leslie, just tell us
your idea.

360
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:58,762
Los Angeles, season one,
isn't gonna watch itself.

361
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,447
Here it is.

362
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,752
What do you think?

363
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,289
I don't have an idea.
I'm sorry.

364
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:11,458
I thought if we all
worked really hard,

365
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:12,826
I-I could come up
with something.

366
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:13,860
But I don't have anything,

367
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:14,961
and we're totally screwed.

368
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,897
And what we need to do

369
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,066
is just keep working
and just work again, more,

370
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:21,802
and just do it and get it,

371
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,236
and then we got it
and we're good.

372
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:26,606
And go with that.

373
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,041
I think I'm gonna turn in.

374
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:29,776
You're not going anywhere.
No one's going anywhere.

375
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:30,844
No one's sleeping,

376
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,028
because this
is an all-nighter.

377
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:33,363
And that'll be fun.

378
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:35,015
We'll all stay up,
and then I'll be like,

379
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:36,182
"hey! No one sleep!"

380
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:39,653
Do you hear how loud that is?

381
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,254
You're not sleeping
through that.

382
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:42,422
Is there anything else
to eat?

383
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,824
The marshmallows
are all gone.

384
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,709
We have nothing to eat.

385
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:47,727
Jerry scared
all the fish away

386
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,830
with his loud
personal stories.

387
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,731
Uck, I wanna go home.

388
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,866
I miss my canopy bed.

389
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,368
Yeah, I'm fine
with not camping.

390
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:58,605
Especially since my stupid
boyfriend abandoned me!

391
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:00,440
I'll fire up the van.

392
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,511
You know, I've never
moved this slowly before.

393
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:07,564
It's almost like
being in quicksand.

394
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,282
Hey, um, listen...

395
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,400
When you dumped me,

396
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:13,086
it was really embarrassing.

397
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,288
You just kind of...
took off.

398
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,756
Oh, I'm so sorry.

399
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:18,692
I mean, I never meant
to hurt you.

400
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,928
And, well, um,
I'm back now.

401
00:14:21,996 --> 00:14:23,563
Hey, I have a great idea.

402
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:25,665
Why don't we go to this
rustic Diner that I know?

403
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,067
We can have
egg white omelets,

404
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,119
and we can continue
to talk about us.

405
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,837
Sounds good.

406
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,874
No, no.

407
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,128
Chocolate or butterscotch?

408
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,213
Uh, swirl me.

409
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:42,582
Dude, camping is awesome.

410
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,650
I love it.

411
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:45,585
Excuse me, gentlemen.

412
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:48,021
How long have you been
running power to this tent?

413
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,789
I don't know.
How long have we been here?

414
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:51,825
Ten hours.

415
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:54,794
No! I was Tivoing
Cupcake Wars.

416
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:56,096
This is ridiculous!

417
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:57,647
Look, I am used
to a certain level

418
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:58,815
of comfort in my life,

419
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,267
and I didn't want
to sacrifice that!

420
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,835
Okay, well, I packed
everything up,

421
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:03,853
so now you're telling me
I have to go unpack it.

422
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:05,038
Guys, this is a sign.

423
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:06,139
You wanted to leave,

424
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,141
and now you're stuck here
with me!

425
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:09,809
So we can work all night!

426
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,695
This is gonna be
so much fun!

427
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:12,946
All night work!

428
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,147
All night work!

429
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:15,348
All night work!

430
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,649
You know what?

431
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,051
There's a Bed & Breakfast
right up the road.

432
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,152
I'm gonna head there.

433
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:21,621
Yes! Let's keep
brainstorming.

434
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,056
I have a good feeling
about this B&B.

435
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:26,359
One day, there's gonna
be a plaque there that reads,

436
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:27,994
"this is where Leslie Knope

437
00:15:28,062 --> 00:15:33,333
"came up with
the amazing idea for..."

438
00:15:33,384 --> 00:15:35,135
Damn, I thought
that would work.

439
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,835
Welcome to
"The Quiet Corn".

440
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,211
I'm Elsa Clack.

441
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:43,113
Breakfast is served
between 5:30

442
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:44,781
and 6:15 A.M.

443
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:47,050
What if we sleep
to a normal hour?

444
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:49,369
Well, that would be
very rude of you.

445
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:52,005
May I take
your breakfast order?

446
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,674
We have hardboiled eggs,

447
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:59,463
homemade tomato slices
with dry seed and leek jam,

448
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,182
and your choice
of german muffin.

449
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:06,136
What the
Is a german muffin?

450
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:10,841
Oh, good lord.

451
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:12,442
I call the bed!

452
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:14,511
Ah.

453
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,612
Awesome.

454
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,980
I hate this place.

455
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:18,815
This place is the exact opposite
of Skymall.

456
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:19,816
Oh, listen to this.

457
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:21,518
"Dear Quiet Corn,

458
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:23,720
"thank you for
your beautiful Inn.

459
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:26,022
"My wife and I spent
three nights of ecstasy

460
00:16:26,074 --> 00:16:27,624
in this room."

461
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:28,692
Ugh!

462
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:29,743
Gyash!

463
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:33,463
There are no TVs anywhere.

464
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:35,882
This place is lamer
than outside.

465
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,501
I'm chillin'.

466
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:38,802
What is that?

467
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:40,037
Jim.

468
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:43,340
♪ Tou come sleepin'
in the tent ♪

469
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,374
Oh, my God.

470

471
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:48,895

473
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,986

474
00:16:56,054 --> 00:16:57,721
where have you been?

475
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,356
I told you I was gonna
take you campin', didn't I?

476
00:16:59,407 --> 00:17:00,657
Yeah.

477
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:02,159
Well, I'm taking you campin'.
Look at this.

478
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:03,727
This is what I had set up
at the other campsite.

479
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:05,912
Except for it
was way nicer there.

480
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:08,732
But this'll do.
I've got some champagne.

481
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:12,069
And I had to drink
most of it to survive.

482
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:14,871
So I'm kind of buzzed
right now.

483
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,907
I'm just glad you're here.

484
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:18,008
Can we make out now?

485
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:22,346
No, you have to understand

486
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,414
that at the time,
I genuinely thought

487
00:17:24,465 --> 00:17:26,583
that you and I would never
see each other again.

488
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:28,468
I completely understand.

489
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:30,020
Well, that's what
makes you so amazing.

490
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:32,255
- No.
- Ann Perkins...

491
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:33,307
Amazing.

492
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:37,995
Oh, no.

493
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:40,280
Oh, no?

494
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:41,531
Oh, no.

495
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,784
No, no, no.
I wasn't saying that...

496
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:46,403
I thought we should
get back together again.

497
00:17:46,471 --> 00:17:47,938
But you said that...

498
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:49,706
You indicated...

499
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:52,292
Oh, my God,
this is happening again.

500
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:54,378
I have to move, right?

501
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:56,279
Yeah.

502
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:57,547
I'm gonna leave the country.

503
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:00,116
Bye, everybody.
Bye.

504
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,455
Hey.

505
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:06,790
Hey. Couldn't sleep?

506
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:10,794
No. My room is filled
with cat hair and cat smell.

507
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:13,563
And actual cats,
roughly 12 cats.

508
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,798
Hmm, sounds delightful.

509
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,299
Leslie, what are you doing?

510
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:19,803
I am listening to
Steal my Sunshine by Len.

511
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:22,439
A one-hit wonder, like me.

512
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:23,640
You're not
a one-hit wonder.

513
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,808
Well, I will be.

514
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,510
I peaked at
the Harvest Festival, Ron.

515
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:27,844
Years from now,
people are gonna say,

516
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:29,112
"Remember that woman
who came up with

517
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,580
"the Harvest Festival idea
and never came up

518
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:31,782
"with another idea again?

519
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:32,749
"What happened to her?
What was her name?

520
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:33,950
"Kim? Anyway, who cares?

521
00:18:34,018 --> 00:18:35,585
"She's stupid,
and she's dead now."

522
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:36,753
For the first time ever,

523
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:38,188
the Parks Department
has real momentum,

524
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:39,656
and I'm gonna ruin it
for everybody.

525
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:41,758
You've done more
for this group of people

526
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:43,326
than anyone else.

527
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:45,962
You're the only reason we all
still have jobs.

528
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,514
I think we'll be okay.

529
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:49,165
Yeah, okay, well, I would
love to chit-chat about this,

530
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:50,500
but I need
to keep working, okay?

531
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:52,769
And keep pushing so that
my breakthrough will happen,

532
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:55,272
and I will be ready for it.

533
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,506
You know what?

534
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:59,309
I just had an idea
for a new project.

535
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:01,144
- Really?
- Yes.

536
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,680
Yes, I think... I think
this could be really good.

537
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:04,948
What is it?

538
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:05,949
Come with me.

539
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:07,617
Right through here.

540
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:08,652
Wait, what's happening?

541
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,620
Aah! Ron!

542
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:12,389
Ron, what are you doing?

543
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:13,740
This is my idea.

544
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:16,159
You're gonna shut your brain
down and go to sleep,

545
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,661
and I'm gonna stay out here
and guard the door

546
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,729
- so you can't leave.
- No! Ron!

547
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,031
You've been
thinking about work

548
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:22,666
non-stop for years!

549
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:23,867
It's time to rest!

550
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:25,552
All my binders
are downstairs!

551
00:19:25,636 --> 00:19:26,703
Shh!

552
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,105
All due respect,
Ms. Clack,

553
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:29,539
stick a german muffin in it.

554
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,641
Fair enough.
I'm just gonna go to bed.

555
00:19:31,709 --> 00:19:33,743
Just call it a night.

556
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:35,212
I already checked, Leslie.

557
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,813
The transom is painted shut.

558
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:39,349
Damn it!

559
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:42,052
Oh, my God, there's, like,
50 cats in here.

560
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,525
Where's Leslie?

561
00:19:48,593 --> 00:19:50,193
Not 100% sure.

562
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:51,745
Should we reschedule or...

563
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,330
nope, she'll be here.

564
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:54,331
Good morning!

565
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:56,166
So I just slept seven hours,

566
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,034
which is twice as long
as I usually sleep,

567
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,503
so I'm a little disoriented.

568
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,605
But I did wake up
with a million ideas,

569
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,256
and Ron would not
let me have any paper,

570
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:05,575
so I had to write them down
on this doily.

571
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:08,011
We should buy a telescope
and make the old ranger station

572
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:09,779
in Ramsett Park
an Observatory.

573
00:20:09,847 --> 00:20:10,881
That way,
we could sell tickets

574
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:11,948
and have class trips.

575
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,183
- I like it! We'll...
- Good!

576
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,267
Then have theme night
at the Park.

577
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:16,419
We could have singles,
um, date night,

578
00:20:16,487 --> 00:20:19,523
uh, seniors, and we could
have a citywide yard sale,

579
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,858
which would be part auction,
part Antiques Road Show.

580
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:23,093
And then we could have

581
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:24,528
the professors from
the Community College

582
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:25,929
come in and assign value
to the objects.

583
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:27,564
And then we could split
the profits for the school.

584
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:28,565
It'd be a lot of fun.

585
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:29,566
I'll see you boys later.

586
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:30,934
Bye, Ron!

587
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,736
They say you're only as good
as your last idea.

588
00:20:32,803 --> 00:20:35,472
I say you're only as good
as the people you work with.

589
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,407
Leslie Knope is back.

590
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,575
Ha ha!

591
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,877
Oh, my God,
my breath is so bad.

Yeah, she died, like,
20 minutes after that.
