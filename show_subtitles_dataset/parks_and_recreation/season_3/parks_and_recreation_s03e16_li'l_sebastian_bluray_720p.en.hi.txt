1
00:00:01,176 --> 00:00:02,208
Why? Why?

2
00:00:02,276 --> 00:00:03,243
You gotta stop screaming.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,444
I will I just get excited.

4
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:06,747
Why do we call it
entertainment 7/Tewnty?

5
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:09,149
'Cause you're willing to go
around the world twice

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,383
for your clients.

7
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:11,618
That is unbelievable!
But listen to me.

8
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:12,619
Listen to me.

9
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:15,622
I'm gonna need you on my team
to pull this off, all right?

10
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,890
I can't do this without you.

11
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,323
I don't know, man.
I-I can't.

12
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:20,292
I'd have to quit my job.

13
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,894
Okay I'll do it without you.

15
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:44,315
I have some very important news

16
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:46,250
about our favorite mini-horse,
Li'l Sebastian.

17
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:48,286
- Yea!
- Li'l Sebastian!

18
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:50,721
He died last night.

19
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,889
No.

20
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:54,158
But we can take comfort
in the fact

21
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:55,425
that he is in heaven now,

22
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:57,861
doing the two things
he loves doing the most.

23
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,230
Eating carrots
and urinating freely.

24
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:02,299
When I walked in this morning

25
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:03,801
and saw the flag
was at half-mast,

26
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:06,402
I thought, "All right."

27
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:09,638
"Another bureaucrat ate it."

28
00:01:09,707 --> 00:01:12,075
But then I found out
it was Li'l Sebastian.

29
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:14,043
Half-mast is too high.

30
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,846
Show some damned respect.

31
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:18,681
Because of all he's done
for the town,

32
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:19,682
we are gonna be holding

33
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,383
a small memorial service
for him.

34
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,718
But for now,

35
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:26,121
I think we should bow our heads
in a moment of silence.

36
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:31,292
♪ have a good time ♪

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,163
♪ the best thing
about being a woman ♪

38
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:39,499

39
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,635

40
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:43,104

♪ give him a lady # #.

42
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:47,307
I got it, thank you.

43
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,544
Well, the good news is
this is just tendonitis.

44
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:52,279
How is that good news?

45
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,947
The other option
was shoulder cancer.

46
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,949
- Really?
- No.

47
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,050
Look, you exercise a lot.

48
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,218
You're in great shape.

49
00:01:58,285 --> 00:01:59,819
Little things like this happen

50
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:00,820
with men of your age.

51
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,122
Men of my age?

52
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,322
How old do you think I am?

53
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,125
- 42.
- Ha.

54
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:08,294
I am 44,
and I plan to live to be 150.

55
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,528
Okay.

56
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,396
So. What's the cure?

57
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,465
Get a time machine.
Go back to being 20.

58
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:16,869
Dr. Harris,
you are literally

59
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,837
the meanest person
I have ever met.

60
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,505
So maintenance is gonna set up
the stage.

61
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,242
Ron will be laying
the ceremonial wreath.

62
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,843
Uh, Leslie, there's
a 13th century Italian poem

63
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,211
by Dante Alighieri

64
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:29,147
that would be very appropriate.

65
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:30,481
Oh, Jerry,
that sounds wonderful.

66
00:02:30,548 --> 00:02:33,684
Okay, Andy, I need you
to write a memorial song.

67
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:35,386
Something like
"Candle in the wind,"

68
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:36,888
but 5,000 times better.

69
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:38,256
Easy.

70
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:39,824
Hey, if you want a song
from Andy Dwyer,

71
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,425
lead singer of Mouse Rat,
you should know

72
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,393
he doesn't get out of bed
for less than $1,000.

73
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,560
We can give him 50 bucks.

74
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:46,396
Sold. Pow.

75
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:48,165
Okay, here is a memo
with some facts

76
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:49,565
about Li'l Sebastian.

77
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:54,304
I think you'll find yours
particularly interesting.

78
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,539
It's just a list of facts.

79
00:02:56,607 --> 00:02:57,940
What?

80
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:59,508
Okay, mine says,
"you have a cute butt."

81
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:00,843
Hm?

82
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,112
That's weird.
Must be a typo.

83
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,313
Yeah, Jerry,
it's probably a typo,

84
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,480
because it probably
should've said,

85
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:06,748
"you have a cube butt."

86
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,317
'Cause your butt's shaped
like a cube.

87
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,584
Yeah.

88
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:11,253
The question is,
why is my memo different

89
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,888
than everyone else's?

90
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:16,991
Cube butt, cube butt.

91
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,293
Cube butt, cube butt.

92
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,228
Cube butt, cube butt,
cube butt.

93
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:23,131
Okay, all the permits cleared
for the...

94
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,565
Horse funeral.

95
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:26,567
What was that tone?

96
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,636
What?
Oh, nothing.

97
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:30,237
Question!
Who's a genius?

98
00:03:30,305 --> 00:03:31,404
Tom Haverford.

99
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,841
Jean-Ralphio just started

100
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,943
an exclusive,
high-end production company,

101
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,444
and he's willing to put on

102
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,745
Li'l Sebastian's
memorial service

103
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:41,548
Pro Bono, just for the pub.

104
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:45,118
Pub is an abbreviation
for publicity.

105
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:47,720
Jean-Ralphio is a clown.

106
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:50,089
This is the memorial
for Li'l Sebastian,

107
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:52,291
not double-coupon night
at a strip club.

108
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,692
First off,
double-coupon night

109
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,894
is an incredible value.

110
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:57,363
Secondly, this guy just started
a business.

111
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,232
He's my friend.
It would really help him out.

112
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,799
Plus, I'm gonna oversee
everything

113
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,334
and make sure everything
goes great.

114
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:04,936
Okay, Tom, we trust you.

115
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,104
Make us proud.

116
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:08,573
Make him proud.

117
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,608
Why don't you just
Photoshop that out?

118
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,644
Oh, hi, Ann Perkins.

119
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,113
Hi.
How are you?

120
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:16,681
I'm dying.

121
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:18,148
What?

122
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,016
- Tendonitis.
- Oh.

123
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:22,919
I don't know if you should lead
with "I'm dying."

124
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:24,354
You're right, you're right.

125
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,522
So.

126
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,623
What's up with you?

127
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:28,558
I'm just helping Leslie plan

128
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:31,528
Li'l Sebastian's
memorial service.

129
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:33,463
Li'l Sebastian died?

130
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:34,498
He was old,

131
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,299
and he had a lot of ailments.

132
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:38,467
- Like tendonitis?
- I don't know.

133
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:39,969
I don't have his chart
in front of me.

134
00:04:40,037 --> 00:04:40,970
Could you get it?

135
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:42,171
W-what?

136
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,973
N... there's no chart.

137
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,341
Oh, my God.

138
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:47,710
Death is inescapable.

139
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:49,645
Goodbye, Ann Perkins.

140
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,647
Man, whenever I run
into that guy,

141
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:53,748
he always just throws me off.

142
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:54,783
Don't even talk about Chris.

143
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,051
Every time I hear his name,

144
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,886
I think about the fact
that he's gonna find out

145
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:00,355
about me and Ben,
and he's gonna fire both of us.

146
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:02,958
And about how much he hurt you.

147
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,359
- Yeah, there you go.
- Yeah.

148
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:06,395
Okay, I'm gonna see Ben in
in our secret meeting place

149
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:07,861
in a few minutes.
How do I look?

150
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,830
What are you going for?

151
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,940
Sophisticated
with a hint of slutty.

152
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:12,100
Bulls-eye.

153
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:14,085
So nice to see you
so happy about a guy.

154
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:15,670
Thanks.
I don't know.

155
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:17,004
When I look
at my life right now,

156
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:19,206
it feels almost perfect.

157
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:21,342
I mean,
we have to sneak around,

158
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,246
but weirdly, it's kind of fun
that nobody knows.

159
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:28,181
Hello, Leslie.

160
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:30,216
How long have you been sleeping
with Ben?

161
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,548
What?

162
00:05:34,946 --> 00:05:36,913
How long have you been
sleeping with Ben?

163
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,248
That's disgusting and wrong.

164
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:40,617
I don't even get...
why would... I...

165
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,285
I've never had sex
with anyone anywhere.

166
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:44,787
It's none of your...

167
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:46,655
you have h...
the nerve...

168
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:47,923
the audacity.

169
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:50,125
Ben is my boss, technically.

170
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:52,594
And he is terrible, facewise.

171
00:05:52,662 --> 00:05:54,496
And how... how...

172
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:55,564
Do I know, frankly,

173
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:56,999
that you're not sleeping
with him?

174
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,266
Maybe you are.

175
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,735
Maybe you're trying
to throw me off.

176
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:02,837
Hm, check and mate.

177
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,304
This is an outrage!

178
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:05,472
Who do I call?

179
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,274
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

180
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:08,643
- Hey.
- Hey, Ron.

181
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,444

189

would kiss.

194

Our countries have had
a very special relationship.

211

- Oh, no!

You've proven your point.

00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,675
Hey, why is Perd Hapley

369
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:16,143
unveiling the memorial stone?

370
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,245
Because Joe from sewage
had to hand out the armbands,

371
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:19,712
and Pert had to fill in
for Mortenson,

372
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,181
and Mortenson had to fill in
for Howser.

373
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:22,582
Okay, well,
why couldn't Donna do it?

374
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,584
Because Donna's reading
Jerry's Italian poem.

375
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,924
This is sort of a mess.

376
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:33,392
- No, it's okay, we're...
- What the hell, Leslie?

377
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,329
I thought I was supposed to lay
the ceremonial wreath.

378
00:13:36,396 --> 00:13:38,230
Why is Councilman Howser
doing it?

379
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:41,100
Because you are doing...

380
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,435
Something better.

381
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:45,271
You are lighting
the memorial flame,

382
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:47,538
which is the greatest honor
of all.

383
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:49,007
Oh, my God.
Ron, congratulations.

384
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:50,942
I saved it for you, Ron.

385
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,111
Who caught you guys?

386
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:54,612
A very nosy maintenance worker,

387
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,448
and we talked to him,
and now we're all friends,

388
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:57,548
and he's not gonna tell on us.

389
00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:58,549
It's totally fine.

390
00:13:58,617 --> 00:13:59,550
I think if you would know

391
00:13:59,618 --> 00:14:01,252
one thing about me,

392
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,153
it would be that I prefer
laying wreaths

393
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,056
to lighting torches.

394
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:08,625
I have cried twice in my life.

395
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:10,461
Once when I was seven,

396
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,229
and I was hit by a school bus.

397
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:14,965
And then again when I heard

398
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,401
that Li'l Sebastian had passed.

399
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:19,602
His memory will live on...

400
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,737
Hup, and...

401
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:22,805
As today we light a fire

402
00:14:22,873 --> 00:14:25,541
that will burn on for eternity.

403
00:14:27,478 --> 00:14:29,145
Okay, deep breath.

404
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:30,179
I think we got through it.

405
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:31,314
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

406
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:32,382
Hey, Jerry, you put propane

407
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:33,483
in the eternal flame, right?

408
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,884
No, they were out.

409
00:14:34,951 --> 00:14:36,885
So I just got a big thing
of lighter fluid.

410
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:37,952
It's kind of the same thing.

411
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:40,422
Oh!

412
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,290
Huh, ho!

413
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:43,492
We planned that!

414
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,626
Wow, wow!

415
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,261
Ohhhh!

416
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:49,164
- We planned that.
- Yea!

417
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:50,499
Wow.

418
00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:54,899
Jeez Ron I am...
very sorry...

419
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:56,610
I...

420
00:14:56,677 --> 00:14:58,645
I guess I put too much fuel
in the torch.

421
00:14:58,713 --> 00:14:59,946
Oh, I don't know, Jerry.

422
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:02,048
I think you're being hard
on yourself.

423
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,383
Are you mad at me?

424
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,185
'Cause without eyebrows,
I can't really tell.

425
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,622
Ron Swanson loves
his facial hair.

426
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:10,624
And we burned it off.

427
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:12,350
This thing that we're doing,

428
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,815
it's unsustainable.

429
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:14,911
What, you want to break up?

430
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,079
What? No.
I like you.

431
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:18,281
Well, then...
you want to tell Chris.

432
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:19,749
What? No.
I like my job.

433
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:20,917
Well, then, what do we do?

434
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:23,219
Okay, operation shutdown.

435
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:25,554
No more secret hand-holding.

436
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:27,756
No more smooching
in Ann's office.

437
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:29,024
In fact, when we're at work,

438
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,392
we just shouldn't talk
to each other at all.

439
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:31,960
Okay, well, that's gonna be
really hard,

440
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,128
and we could still get fired.

441
00:15:33,196 --> 00:15:34,129
I know.

442
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:35,597
But it's worth the risk

443
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:37,299
if I can be with you.

444
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,167
All right.

445
00:15:39,235 --> 00:15:40,769
Well, then, I'm in.

446
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:42,170
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

447
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:43,637
I'm sorry.
No, it's force of habit.

448
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:44,939
So what do I do, huh?

449
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,341
Do I stay here or roll the dice

450
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:48,575
with Jean-Ralphio?

451
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:50,244
You have no interest
in government work,

452
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:54,081
and you slow everything down
with your selfish attitude.

453
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,350
I'd love for you
to stick around, Tommy.

454
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:59,786
It'll be damn hard
to replace you.

455
00:15:59,853 --> 00:16:01,354
But I'll support you
either way.

456
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:02,688
Two of my lovers in one place.

457
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:05,491
What a coincidence.

458
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,526
Tammy.

459
00:16:06,593 --> 00:16:08,028
Hello, Ron.

460
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:09,762
Oop, what happened here?

461
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,298
And more importantly,

462
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:14,434
does the carpet match the face?

463
00:16:14,501 --> 00:16:16,335
If you're looking for trouble,
take it somewhere else.

464
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:18,037
An hour ago, a giant fireball

465
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:20,672
consumed my entire face.

466
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,807
And it was far preferable

467
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:23,875
to spending another second
with you.

468
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:24,977
Hm.

469
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:27,846
Tell that to your pants tent.

470
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:30,015
It's just the way I'm standing.

471
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,282
Go back to the library,

472
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,653
where you belong.

473
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,854
Hey, Glenn.

474
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:37,888
Wanna dance?

475
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:39,723
No, I'm okay.

476
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,492
Just one dance?

477
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,860
- No.
- With mommy?

usually caused by overuse.

482
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,470
Have you been working out
more than usual?

483
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:55,839
I did do 10,000 push-ups
last week.

484
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:57,374
Oh, really.

485
00:16:57,442 --> 00:17:00,743
That might have something
to do with it.

486
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,812
You need to relax.
You're in great shape.

487
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,347
For a 44-year-old.

488
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,816
Yeah.
That's how old you are, man.

489
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:09,918
You're right.
I've been overreacting.

490
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,854
I don't like thinking
about death.

491
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:14,823
Death is the opposite of...

492
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:17,060
Being alive?

493
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:19,094
Exactly.

494
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:20,228
Look at us.

495
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:22,230
Talking like friends.

496
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,698
Yeah.

497
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,533
What the hell.
Friends.

500
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:33,641
What's the point
in doing 10,000 push-ups

501
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,509
if you're gonna do them alone?

502
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:37,577
I'd much rather do
5,000 push-ups

503
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:40,014
with a wonderful woman.

504
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,849

Honey, we're already married.

No, this is way more important
than that.

Are you Leslie Knope?

00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:38,802
Yes.

530
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,303
My name is William Barnes.

531
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:41,737
Do you have a minute to talk?

532
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:42,805
Sure.

533
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:44,874
We really enjoyed the service.

534

That fireball
was truly amazing.

I'm glad.
'Cause it was planned.

536
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,380
And you were also responsible

537
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:51,747
for the Harvest Festival,
correct?

538
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:53,583
Well, a lot of people
contributed to that.

539
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,017
You don't have to be modest.

540
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,351
We know it was you.

541
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,120
You did an amazing job.

542
00:18:58,188 --> 00:18:59,588
Thank you.

543
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,523
We are part of a group
that tries to identify

544
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:03,425
potential candidates
for political office

545
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:04,726
here in town.

546
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:07,262
And we think that you
might fit the bill.

547
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,165
Oh.

548
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,200
Wow.

549
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:15,136
Which office in particular?

550
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:16,737
Well, there are a couple
city council seats

551
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:17,738
we think are vulnerable.

552
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:19,340
Mm-hmm.

553
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,442
And the mayor's term
is up next year.

554
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,543
Uh... um... huh.

555
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:24,579
All we need to know
right now is

556
00:19:24,646 --> 00:19:27,414
are you theoretically interested
in running for office?

557
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,216
Absotootly, I am.

558
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:30,984
Very sorry that I just used
that word.

559
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:32,586
But yes.

560
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:34,787
I just...

561
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:37,357
I've dreamed about this moment
for a long time.

562
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:38,858
Guess I'll be heading home.

563
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:42,629
Catching the number 12 bus
to Satan's butthole?

564
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:45,464
Actually, I prefer
the number 69 train...

565
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,932
To Humpsville station.

566
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,368
Red alert, Swanson.

567
00:19:49,436 --> 00:19:50,569
Your ex-wife is back.

568
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:52,037
No kidding, Donna.

569
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:53,205
Not her.

570
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:56,542
The other ex-wife.

571
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,977
Tammy One.

572
00:19:59,045 --> 00:20:02,747
She's in your office.

573
00:20:03,915 --> 00:20:05,450
Oh, [Bleep].

574
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,318
♪ so much better than one ♪

575
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,953
would I have to quit my job?

576
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:10,622
Look, that's a long way off.

577
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,123
- Of course.
- But listen.

578
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,392
When you run,
even in a local election,

579
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,161
your life becomes an open book.

580
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:19,463
So if you so much as stiff
a waiter on his tip

581
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:21,831
or use a government stamp
for personal mail,

582
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:23,600
it will come out.

583
00:20:23,668 --> 00:20:24,968
So before we go any further,

584
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:26,570
I need you to tell me...

585
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:28,572
is there a scandal out there?

586
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,041
Is there anything at all
you need to tell us

587
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:34,743
about your life?

588
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,847
Nope.

589
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:40,849
All right.

590
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:43,852
Well, we'll be in touch.

591
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,690
♪ no, no ♪

592
00:20:48,757 --> 00:20:50,958

595
00:21:05,277 --> 00:21:07,078
Yeah, I think we can do that
for a million.

596
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:08,396
Okay, we'll talk soon.

597
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:10,980
There was no one
on the other end

598
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,082
of that phone call,

599
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,650
but soon there will be.

600
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:15,684
Welcome to the Dreamatorium,

601
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:18,320
A.K.A. The headquarters
of Entertainment 7/Twenty.

602
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:20,389
We got a pool table,
a ping-pong table,

603
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:22,245
a couch with a ceiling on it,

604
00:21:22,342 --> 00:21:24,677
- In-house DJ.
- DJ Blunt.

605
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:25,744
And best of all,

606
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:28,247
former NBA superstar
Detlef Schrempf

607
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:29,282
is on retainer.

608
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:30,849
What's up, Detlef?

609
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,117
So Tom,

610
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:33,518
what does this
business do, again?

611
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,619
it's a multimedia

612
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,788
entertainment production
conglomerate.

613
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:37,989
I don't know, man.

614
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:39,357
You have a lot
of overhead here.

615
00:21:39,425 --> 00:21:41,426
Ever thought
about scaling back a bit

616
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:43,128
and focusing on building
your client base?

617
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:45,430
Thanks a lot, Forbes magazine.

618
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:47,364
But we didn't hire you
to give us business advice.

619
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,933
We hired you to look pretty
and shoot baskets.

620
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,035
So why don't you head over there
and do your thing?

621
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:52,703
We want people to see you
when the come in, Detlef.

622
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,938
Pick me!

623
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:57,174
Uh-oh, uh-oh,
uh-oh, uh-oh.

624
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:59,276
We're living the dream.
