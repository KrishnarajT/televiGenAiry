1
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:10,220
We're asking everyone
to do street parking.

2
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:12,255
I'm not street parking
my Mercedes.

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:14,090
Well, everyone is.
I'm doing it.

4
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:16,226
'Cause nobody wants
to steal a Saturn.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,362
All right, uh,
moving on to recycling.

6
00:00:21,232 --> 00:00:23,166
- You okay, Ron?
- Just a little tooth pain.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,368
I'm fine.
Continue.

8
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:27,737
Okay, each department
will be getting blue bins...

9
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:31,307
Do you need to go
to the dentist, Ron?

10
00:00:31,342 --> 00:00:33,009
I don't like dentists.

11
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,078
Just a second.

12
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:36,079
- Hey.
- No, no.

13
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:37,146
No!

14
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:38,281
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

15
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:42,819
Aah!

16
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:45,154
- Oh!
- What the?

17
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:46,489
Oh, my God!

18
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,791
I'm sorry, everybody.
What were we talking about...

19
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,793
Recycling?

20
00:00:50,828 --> 00:00:53,062
Dentist pulled
the tooth out yesterday.

21
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,465
But it's always a good idea
to demonstrate

22
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:57,600
to your co-workers
that you are capable

23
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:00,403
of withstanding
a tremendous amount of pain.

24
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:03,740
Plus, it's always fun
to see Tom faint.

26
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:28,932
Attention, everybody!

27
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:30,199
Everybody, listen up.

28
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:33,970
You are all officially invited
to a dinner party,

29
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:35,305
7:00 P.M. tonight
at our home,

30
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,507
which is officially
my friend Burly's home,

31
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,275
because I don't have a home.

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,643
That's it.
There's no more left.

33
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:41,945
Give it to him.

34
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,313
We've been dating
for almost a month,

35
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:45,014
so we just decided

36
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:47,317
that we wanted to do
something special.

37
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:50,954
And dinner parties do combine
two of our favorite things...

38
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:52,622
dinner and parties.

39
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,157
- Parties.
- Yeah.

40
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:58,461
It's like if you could have
a Xbox pancake.

41
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,163
Your invitations
include requests

42
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:01,864
for each of you to bring stuff,

43
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:03,366
'cause we don't have
a whole lot.

44
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,035
- Don't be late.
- Watch out.

45
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,471
"Dearest Tom,
please bring silverware."

46
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:11,341
- "Please bring cooked steak."
- This is ridiculous.

47
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,608
They're young.
They're in love.

48
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:14,410
They're ready to show it
to the world.

49
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:15,611
It's very sweet.

50
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:17,480
- And we're all going.
- What?

51
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,716
There's a boy's sale
at Dillard's today.

52
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,250
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

53
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:22,552
You going tonight?

54
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:25,388
Yeah. Apparently they want me
to bring Avatar

55
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:29,993
and 50 pairs of 3-d glasses
and a 3-d-capable television.

56
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:31,394
- Mm.
- Yeah.

57
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:33,329
Well, I will see you there,
with all of those things.

58
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:34,664
I was actually coming
to see you.

59
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:35,965
I wanted your advice
on something.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,067
- Oh, yeah?
- My boss in Indianapolis...

61
00:02:38,102 --> 00:02:40,436
He wants me back on the road
in a week.

62
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:43,906
But then this morning
Chris offered me a job

63
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:47,377
to stay here in Pawnee
and work for him.

64
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:49,779
- Do you want to do that?
- Well, I don't know.

65
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:51,814
I've been moving around so much
the past few years,

66
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:54,183
it might be nice to stay
in one place for a while.

67
00:02:54,218 --> 00:02:57,453
- What do you think?
- Well, this is a great city.

68
00:02:57,488 --> 00:02:59,255
You know, it's definitely
the best city in Indiana,

69
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,357
probably America,
possibly the world.

70
00:03:01,392 --> 00:03:02,892
Sure.

71
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,927
But on the other hand,
you've put in 12 years

72
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:06,929
with the state government.

73
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:08,398
So you think
I should say no to Chris

74
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:12,402
and head back
to Indianapolis or...?

75
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:14,937
It's a tough call.
You know what I would do?

76
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:16,873
You should make
a pros and cons list.

77
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:19,108
- That always works for me.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

78
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:20,910
Okay, maybe I'll do that.

79
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:22,879
Excellent.
Nice talking to you.

80
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,480
- Good stuff.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:26,082
Okay.

82
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,220
So how does this work?

83
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,822
All right, you just fill out
your name tag,

84
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:34,891
- and you're all set.
- Okay.

85
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:38,661
But I-I mean, do I just go up
and talk to anyone,

86
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,564
or do I wait for them
to talk to me, or...?

87
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:44,901
Are you asking me
how to flirt with men?

88
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:47,236
Okay.
All right.

89
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:48,638
It's a whole new Ann Perkins.

90
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:51,307
I'm putting myself out there,
meeting some new people,

91
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,676
having some casual fun,

92
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,779
and it is... awkward.

93
00:03:56,814 --> 00:04:00,283
Gayle went out and got me
this new party shirt.

94
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:02,652
So be honest...
What do you guys think?

95
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:03,920
You know what, Jerry?

96
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:07,523
I make fun of you a lot,
but credit where credit is due.

97
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:11,260
You know, I like how the...

98
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:15,698
Damn it. I was so close.
It's a terrible shirt.

99
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:18,267
Hey, guys.
Okay, everybody listen up.

100
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:20,937
April's friend Orin is here.

101
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:23,172
He's very intense
and very weird.

102
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:24,674
So if you end up
talking to him,

103
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,175
just make sure you don't reveal

104
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,944
anything personal
about yourself.

105
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,679
- Hey, gang.
- Hey.

106
00:04:29,713 --> 00:04:32,482
- What'd you bring?
- I was in charge of the cake.

107
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:35,218
To be fair, it's not a cake so
much as it is a vegetable loaf.

108
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:36,986
You got your mushrooms,
your alfalfa sprouts,

109
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,356
your spinach, and I had it
sweetened with fruit reduction.

110
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,726
But did they ask you to bring
a vegetable loaf or a cake?

111
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,028
No, a cake,
but this is so much healthier.

112
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:48,364
So not only
does this thing exist,

113
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,466
but now you have deprived
everyone of cake.

114
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,002
- Take a walk, Ron.
- Yep.

115
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:00,042
Donna.
Oh, my God.

116
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:02,178
I am so excited to see you here.

117
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:06,315
These things are horrible
when you're by yourself.

118
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,517
What?

119
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:09,719
Do you know
where you are right now?

120
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:12,221
We're in the jungle.
There are no friends here.

121
00:05:12,256 --> 00:05:14,724
It's every woman for herself.

122
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:17,493
- You're joking, right?
- Do I look like I'm joking?

123
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:20,596
Dating is a zero-sum game.

124
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:24,500
If you get a man,
I don't get that man.

125
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:26,169
I'm here because of advice
that you gave me

126
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,204
to be more adventurous
in my life.

127
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:32,008
Here's some more advice...
Beat it.

128
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:33,342
Hey.

129
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,478
Ben, heard you
might be leaving Pawnee.

130
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:38,781
I don't know.
I'm thinking about it.

131
00:05:38,815 --> 00:05:40,082
Well, you are a huge nerd.

132
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:41,884
But I'd be sorry
to see you go, man.

133
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,152
Thanks, Tom.

134
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:44,787
Okay, this party needs
a little help.

135
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:46,122
I'll be right back.

136
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:48,491
So are you going on, like,
a year-long walking tour

137
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:50,326
of the set
of The Lord of the Rings

138
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,460
in New Zealand?

139
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,462
To be honest with you,
I wasn't a fan

140
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:55,298
of, uh, Peter Jackson's
interpretation.

141
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:56,933
So you can put that one away.

142
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,969
Andy, I think you maybe
should put some more food out.

143
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:03,306
Totally agree. Just firing up
the bagel bites now.

144
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,107
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

145
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:06,609
What do you think?

146
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:08,110
April, you're not supposed
to let me see you.

147
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:09,478
No, come on.
You have to look.

148
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:11,814
This is important. You have
to tell me if I look good.

149
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,316
Hey, guys, what's going on?

150
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,885
Uh, it's supposed to be
a big surprise.

151
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,286
But tonight

152
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:21,023
me and April
are getting married...

153
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:22,792
To each other.

154
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:26,596
- Are you pregnant?
- Yes.

155
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,763
- Yes?
- No.

156
00:06:27,798 --> 00:06:28,998
Are you sick?
Are you terminal?

157
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:30,399
Is it like that movie
A Walk to Remember?

158
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:31,400
- Yes.
- What?

159
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:33,102
- No. God.
- Oh, God.

160
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:34,770
Why are you doing this?

161
00:06:34,805 --> 00:06:37,073
Why is this great thing
happening?

162
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:39,809
Well, I mean, it's actually
a really funny story.

163
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,143
We were hanging out.

164
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:43,813
And suddenly, I was like,

165
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:45,514
"What if we got married
tomorrow?"

166
00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:48,618
And she was like...

167
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:49,919
"Fine."

168
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:52,355
- She's fine.
- That is a great story.

169
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:54,290
But you guys haven't been
together very long,

170
00:06:54,324 --> 00:06:55,891
and you have no place to live.

171
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:57,226
We've been together
long enough,

172
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:58,494
and we'll find a place to live.

173
00:06:58,528 --> 00:06:59,695
Yeah.

174
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,430
Like, a house
or, like, a condo or something.

175
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:02,598
Probably a condo.

176
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,900
It's... you can't just get
a condo.

177
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:07,903
No, you're right...
house.

178
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:10,106
I love Andy and April
as a couple.

179
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,041
I want them
to stay together forever.

180
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,577
But relationships
need planning.

181
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:17,580
You just can't jump
into something without thinking.

182
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:20,883
It took me four years
to find the right hairdresser,

183
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:23,452
and we still fight
all the time!

184
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,388
Andy and April
are gonna surprise people

185
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:26,889
with a secret ceremony.

186
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:29,292
Whoa.
Secret wedding.

187
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,327
Julia Roberts
pulled the same move.

188
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:33,863
Is that that toothy girl
from Mystic Pizza?

189
00:07:33,897 --> 00:07:36,098
Ron, please, I need you
to help me knock some sense

190
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:37,266
into them.

191
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:40,336
It's not really my place
or yours.

192
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,039
- Hi. I'm Ann.
- Brian.

193
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:44,707
What's your occupation?

194
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:46,676
I'm a manager
at a sporting-goods store.

195
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,978
- No way. Me too.
- Seriously? Which one?

196
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:53,449
No, I'm not.
Um, I-I was just ribbing you.

197
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:56,185
- What are you drinking?
- Yeah.

198
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,688
- What?
- Oh, I don't know.

199
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:00,523
I-I couldn't hear you.

200
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:04,493
So you just laughed
and said, "Yeah"?

201
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:07,463
- Yeah.
- Excuse us.

202
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:09,332
That was the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life.

203
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,866
Did you grow up in the woods?

204
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:13,069
Are you Nell
from the movie Nell?

205
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,671
I told you I'm rusty.

206
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:17,306
All right, come with me.

207
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:18,874
- Hey, Andy.
- Yeah.

208
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,377
I know what's going down,
and I'm so happy for you guys.

209
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:22,712
Thank you, Tom.

210
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:24,180
Hey, something
just occurred to me.

211
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:26,582
- Can I be your best man?
- Yeah, dude, totally.

212
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:28,417
- Thank you.
- My best man.

213
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:31,954
One of my life goals
is to be a best man.

214
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:33,889
It's a baller position.

215
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:35,424
You get drunk.
You make speeches.

216
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:38,461
And you make love
to the prettiest bridesmaid,

217
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:40,730
usually standing from behind.

218
00:08:40,764 --> 00:08:43,065
Look, I know that
I cannot tell you what to do.

219
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,600
I know it doesn't work...

220
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:47,069
From all the times I've tried
to tell you what to do before.

221
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:48,404
But you know what would be fun?

222
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:50,840
Maybe we should make
a pros and cons list.

223
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:53,008
Let me take you home, and then
we'll go do that together.

224
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:54,009
It'll be a blast.

225
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:56,946
- Leslie, relax.
- You relax.

226
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,382
You relax all the way home
and get into bed.

227
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,917
- You need to go to bed.
- April.

228
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:03,419
Girl talk.

229
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:05,921
Hey, uh,
what's your middle name?

230
00:09:05,956 --> 00:09:07,890
The justice of the peace lady
needs to know.

231
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:09,625
You don't know
each other's middle names?

232
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,194
I don't want to say it
out loud.

233
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:14,463
- Ew!
- Shut up.

234
00:09:14,498 --> 00:09:18,033
- Roberta!
- Such a loser.

235
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:21,036
- Can't believe I'm marrying him.
- You don't have to.

236
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:23,572
I'm going to.
And then I'm gonna divorce him.

237
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,108
Then I'm gonna marry him again.

238
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:29,779
One time, I fell madly in love
with a Civil War reenactor

239
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:31,480
that I had only known
for six hours.

240
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:33,582
And then I found out
he wore those clothes

241
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,284
all the time.

242
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:36,452
And he was married.

243
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:39,155
But the clothes thing
really bothered me.

244
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,291
You always want
to scribble the name.

245
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:44,994
Make them read.
Draw them in.

246
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:47,296
- Make them work for it.
- Right.

247
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,798
Two shots of Jameson.

248
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:51,567
Don't make
too much eye contact.

249
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:54,570
You want to seem available,
but not too available.

250
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:56,372
Oh, thanks.
I think I'm good for now.

251
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,441
- I'm not gonna...
- Yeah.

252
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,647
All right...
Let's do this.

253
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,849
Ron, you are so amazing

254
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:10,519
with me and April, stuff.

255
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:12,354
I love you, man.

256
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,423
Would you be one
of my best men?

257
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:17,626
I'd be honored to, son.

258
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:20,429
Chris, you helped me
get April back.

259
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:22,264
Would you be my best man?

260
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:25,768
Nothing else in my entire life

261
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:28,170
would make me happier
as long as I live.

262
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:31,874
Jerry. Ah, I'm so glad
you made it.

263
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:33,042
This shirt is hilarious.

264
00:10:33,076 --> 00:10:36,479
Derek and Ben,
will you be my best men?

265
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,148
Got a little competition
for the best man, huh?

266
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:41,550
Well, you know what the best
best man does.

267
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:43,786
Excuse me!

268
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,155
Are there any strippers here?

269
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:47,957
Former strippers?

270
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:50,292
Non-dancers but you're feeling
a little bit drunk?

271
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:51,694
What are you doing?

272
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:53,762
I'm throwing Andy
an impromptu bachelor party.

273
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:55,397
It's my duty as best man.

274
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:56,966
The wedding's in four minutes.

275
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,434
It's that kind
of negative thinking

276
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:01,036
that makes you
a less good best man.

277
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:02,571
Hello?

278
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:03,672
Hi, Ann, it's Leslie...

279
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,441
Leslie Knope
from the Parks Department.

280
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:07,309
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?

281
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,111
April and Andy
are getting married tonight.

282
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,013
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

283
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,448
I need you
to get down here, Ann.

284
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:16,118
I need you to kiss him again
or kiss her or kiss somebody.

285
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:18,921
I don't know, Ann!
Help me, please!

286
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,990
Relationships
are like scuba diving.

287
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:23,993
If you come up too fast,
you get the bends.

288
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:25,327
And the reason why I know this

289
00:11:25,362 --> 00:11:26,729
is because I was dating
a guy once,

290
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:27,897
and we were scuba diving,

291
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,365
and I told him
that I loved him underwater,

292
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,967
and he shot up really fast,
and he got the bends.

293
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:35,971
No, Orin, I don't know
how I'm going to die.

294
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:37,973
Wait. Are you asking me
or telling me?

295
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,642
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

296
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:40,743
Yes, please.

297
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:42,811
April and Andy
are about to get married.

298
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:46,982
Wow. My Brita filter is older
than their relationship.

299
00:11:47,017 --> 00:11:48,918
Wait a second.
Should I change my Brita filter?

300
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:51,020
I don't know. It depends
on how frequently you use it.

301
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:53,022
- It's true.
- Stay focused, okay? Please.

302
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:55,591
The point is two boneheads
whom I love dearly

303
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,159
are about
to sacrifice their future

304
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,928
'cause they haven't thought
this thing through.

305
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:00,396
And nobody seems concerned
about this.

306
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,766
Attention, everybody.
Madames and...

307
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,335
Mis... Wahs.

308
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:09,505
If you would do me
the obligation

309
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:14,843
of having your honor heretofore
in the room

310
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:17,546
doth right over there,
uh, hence.

311
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:18,681
What?

312
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:20,683
Big event in that room,
15 minutes.

313
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:22,585
Oh, my God.
This is really happening.

314
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:26,455
I love April and Andy.
I want them to stay together.

315
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:29,658
And that is why I have to stop
their wedding.

316
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,796
Remember how I told you
there was going to be

317
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,297
a surprise later?

318
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:38,167
Well, the surprise is you're not
actually at a dinner party.

319
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,470
You're at our wedding.

320
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:47,009
All right.
Uh, let's do this.

321
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,067
Ladies and gentlemen,

322
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:13,636
we are gathered here today

323
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,642
to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer
and April Roberta Ludgate.

324
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:22,945
I guess I kind of hate
most things.

325
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:26,949
But I never really seem
to hate you.

326
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:29,518
So I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

327
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,620
- Is that cool?
- Yes.

328
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:34,890
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

329
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:38,193
"April, you're the most
awesome person I have ever known

330
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:39,261
"in my entire life.

331
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:43,799
"I vow to protect you
from danger.

332
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,001
"And I don't care
if I have to fight

333
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:48,504
"an ultimate fighter
or a bear or him,

334
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,939
"your mom...
I would take them down."

335
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:52,274
Andy.

336
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:54,376
I'm getting mad right now
even thinking about it.

337
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,711
- I'm telling you.
- It's okay.

338
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:58,847
I want to spend the rest
of my life...

339
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:00,082
every minute...
with you.

340
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:04,820
And I'm the luckiest man
in the galaxy.

341
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:07,956
And now the rings.

342
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:14,296
By the power vested in me
by the state of Indiana,

343
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,533
I now pronounce you husband
and wife.

344
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,241
- Go fly away.
- Fly. Fly.

345
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:28,077
- Wings of love.
- Oh.

346
00:14:28,111 --> 00:14:29,311
Okay. All right.

347
00:14:29,345 --> 00:14:30,813
So that one is dead.
We know that.

348
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,561
You wouldn't have been able
to stop it, you know.

349
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:48,964
I could've yelled something
or tackled someone.

350
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:51,433
But you didn't,
because deep down,

351
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:53,102
you knew
it wouldn't have mattered.

352
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:55,003
Those kids are gonna do
what they want to do.

353
00:14:55,038 --> 00:14:56,705
They may have just ruined
their lives

354
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,574
on an impulse decision.

355
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:00,576
Leslie, I got married twice.

356
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,078
Both times, I was a lot older
than those two.

357
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:06,815
And both marriages ended
in divorce...

358
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,517
And a burning effigy.

359
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:11,053
Who's to say what works?

360
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:14,389
You find somebody you like,
and you roll the dice.

361
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:17,192
That's all anybody can do.

362
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:19,461
Wait. Weren't you married
three times?

363
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:22,464
Oh, my God, you're right.

364
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,535
I get to burn another effigy.

365
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:29,204
The key to burning
an ex-wife effigy

366
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,373
is to dip it in paraffin wax

367
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:35,210
and then toss the flaming bottle
of isopropyl alcohol...

368
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,012
From a safe distance.

369
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:38,881
Do not stand too close

370
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:41,583
when you light
an ex-wife effigy.

371
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:45,187
My sister is lame,
but Andy's sort of cool.

372
00:15:45,221 --> 00:15:47,923
I guess I kind of see
why he'd marry her.

373
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,659
Also, if anyone finds
my gray hoodie, I lost it.

374
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:52,127
Thanks.

375
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,598
That was beautiful.

376
00:15:56,633 --> 00:16:01,503
You two remind me
of me and my husband, George.

377
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:03,405
I got to nail the speech.

378
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,941
So I brought in an expert...
Jean-Ralphio.

379
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:07,776
Can I throw something on you,
see if it feels good?

380
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:09,144
Sure.

381
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:10,345
Okay, this is what I would do.
I would start with a joke.

382
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,348
Joke, Vince Vaughn quote,
obviously.

383
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,984
Swingers Crashers?
Fred Claus.

384
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,786
Talk about
Andy's ex-girlfriends.

385
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:22,457
Quote from Love Actually.
Hold back your tears. Pause.

386
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:24,159
Drop the microphone.
Get out of that bitch.

387
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:28,030
I wish you the best of luck,
to both of you.

388
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,968
Aw, thank you, grandma.

389
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:35,804
How can anyone
ever possibly top that?

390
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,539
Am I right?

391
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:39,474
So thank you all
for all the talking.

392
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:41,276
Let's just get
back to dancing, huh?

393
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:47,082
Cool.
See you around maybe.

394
00:16:47,116 --> 00:16:50,018
- That went better, right?
- Yes, it did.

395
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:53,155
However, he proudly told me
that he "beat herpes."

396
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:55,390
I'm sorry, Donna.
I'm gonna go home.

397
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:57,659
I just found out
Andy's getting married.

398
00:16:57,694 --> 00:17:00,996
- So?
- So that's my ex-boyfriend.

399
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,598
We were together
for a really long time.

400
00:17:02,632 --> 00:17:05,133
- All right.
- What?

401
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:08,837
What? Listen, you are a hot,
young doctor.

402
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,906
- I'm a nurse, actually.
- Okay, I don't know you.

403
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,208
But I do know
that you can fix your attitude.

404
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:14,943
Do you want to go home
and feel sorry for yourself

405
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:16,445
about a man you didn't want
to marry?

406
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,046
Or do you want to go talk
to that cute boy

407
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:20,549
who has been looking at you
and give him your number

408
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:25,153
before I throw him in my Benz
for myself?

409
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:27,956
All right.

410
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:31,526
I just want to thank
my family, my friends,

411
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:34,463
most importantly,
my best best man,

412
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:35,964
Mr. Tom Haverford.

413
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,533
Oh!
Coolest guy I know.

414
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:40,469
And, ladies, he's single,
I think.

415
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:41,737
You're not still married,
are you?

416
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:45,040
- No.
- But you... you're straight?

417
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,009
- Yes.
- Jean-Ralphio's just a friend?

418
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:48,877
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

419
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:52,781
Anyways, oh, my God,
I'm married!

420
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:55,550
This is crazy.
What happened?

421
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:59,521
But, seriously,
life is short, right?

422
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:02,057
Uh, just... I really think
you should just do

423
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:03,358
whatever makes you happy.

424
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:05,994
That's what April and I did.

425
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,596
We are in love.

426
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,831
So we didn't overthink it.

427
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:14,202
I mean, seriously,
I cannot emphasize

428
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:16,171
how little we thought
about this.

429
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,839
Am I right?

430
00:18:17,874 --> 00:18:21,510
All right, well, this is a song
I wrote for you,

431
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:24,246
April Roberta Ludgate.

432
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,949
I love you.

433
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,905
Exactly. Mortality.

434
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,640
See, I like to take each day
at a time.

435
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:55,077
There's nothing in the world
we can't accomplish if we try.

436
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:56,345
I have to go.

437
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:59,481
It's been great talking to you.

438
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,184
- Hey.
- Don't worry.

439
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:03,752
I'm not gonna say another word.

440
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:04,886
This is your day.

441
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:08,824
I just wanted to say that...

442
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:11,426
I'm really glad you're here.

443
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:14,363
I think you're awesome,
and I love you.

444
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:17,099
Oh.

445
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,170
What's the deal
with that hot girl, April?

446
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:24,106
- What's the deal with her?
- Yeah.

447
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,608
Like, she good to go?
Like, she down to clown?

448
00:19:26,642 --> 00:19:29,945
She's married.

449
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:31,480
She got married,
like, 20 minutes ago.

450
00:19:31,514 --> 00:19:34,416
Oh, my God. That's the same
girl from the thing.

451
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,451
From the wedding ceremony,
yeah.

452
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:38,954
All the good ones
are taken, huh, bro?

453
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,692
Yeah.

454
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,032
Hey.

455
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:55,270
You should stay.

456
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:58,473
Don't go back to Indianapolis.
You should stay here.

457
00:19:58,508 --> 00:20:01,643
- You think?
- Yeah. Yes.

458
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:03,578
It's a great city here,
you know?

459
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:04,880
And there are great people.

460
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:06,381
And you've made a lot
of friends.

461
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,749
And what are you gonna do...

462
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:11,620
Go back to your old job
and hack up people's budgets?

463
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:14,456
Stay here.
Help us build something.

464
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,225
I already accepted the job.

465
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,196
- I'm, uh... I'm staying here.
- That's good.

466
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,565
Yeah, I think so.

467
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:27,803
- Orin's behind me, isn't he?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

468
00:20:27,837 --> 00:20:28,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

469
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:30,138
- So just keep your eyes on me.
- Okay.

470
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:31,506
Don't panic,
'cause he can smell fear.

471
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,574
Just keep talking to me.

472
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:33,909
- Hi.
- Hi.

473
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,577
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

474
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:38,046
- How was the wedding...
- Run.

475
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:44,019
"Hope we can get
together soon."

476
00:20:44,053 --> 00:20:46,188
Okay, now you write,
"Who is this?"

477
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:47,456
Ah.

478
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,491
Hey, you guys, we got a video
from April and Andy.

479
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:50,592
- Oh. Okay.
- Whoo!

480
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:51,860
Yeah!
How you guys doing?

481
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:53,762
- Hey, we're on our honeymoon.
- It is awesome.

482
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:58,533
We're at Burly's family
vacation house on Lake Michigan.

483
00:20:58,568 --> 00:20:59,868
We're having so much fun,

484
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:01,269
except for, uh, Roberta here

485
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:03,772
turns out sucks
at water-skiing so bad.

486
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:04,806
I'm gonna divorce you.

487
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:06,241
Andy sucks at driving a boat.

488
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:09,010
And I'm gonna divorce him,
probably right now.

489
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:11,913
Well, they're still together.
You owe me 20 bucks.

490
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:22,113
