1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,694
There is a crazy flu going around.

2
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:07,545
Lots of miserable
dehydrated people

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,187
with high fevers and diarrhea.

4
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:10,733
And one of those

5
00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:13,818
dehydrated, high-fevered
miserable people

6
00:00:13,855 --> 00:00:14,826
is April...

7
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:16,257
Who hates me.

8
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:22,461
- I want another nurse.
- Well, there are none.

9
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:23,832
We're stretched pretty thin
right now.

10
00:00:23,952 --> 00:00:26,123
Then I want a janitor.
They can do what you do, right?

11
00:00:26,574 --> 00:00:29,379
Yep, nurses and janitors
are totally interchangeable.

12
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,280
Except no one dresses up
like a janitor

13
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,210
when they want to be slutty.

14
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,043
I get the sense that maybe
you're angry at me

15
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:35,982
for kissing Andy...

16
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,658
No, I'm not. What are you talking about?
That's crazy.

17
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:41,011
And that you think it might be
fun to take it out on me.

18
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,535
Please don't do that.

19
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,672
"Do"?
I can't do anything.

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,203
I'm sick.

21
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:52,981
My blankets are on the floor.

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,070
So, JJ, we wanted

24
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:18,106
to talk to you
about the harvest festival.

25
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:20,375
Yeah, I heard you were
bringing that back.

26
00:01:21,643 --> 00:01:23,428
Sorry, I haven't been
feeling myself.

27
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,548
Well, I'm organizing
this huge harvest festival,

28
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:30,618
and I need
at least 80 local businesses

29
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:31,953
to participate.

30
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:33,588
And normally, this is
the kind of thing

31
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:34,856
I would love to do,

32
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:37,792
but I'm just feeling
really tired.

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,129
I think maybe my allergies
are acting up.

34
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:46,000
I've already vomited,
like, five times today.

35
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:48,069
We're having a meeting tonight
at the Chamber of Commerce,

36
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,704
and we're gonna go over
all the details,

37
00:01:49,772 --> 00:01:51,773
and we'd just love if you
could come and join us.

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,976
Sure, anything
for my favorite customer.

39
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:56,961
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

40
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:59,280
Oh, no, no.
Actually, you're my favorite.

41
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:04,969
You spent over $1,000 last year
on waffles alone.

42
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:07,855
Here.

43
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:09,657
I didn't know what
to bring you,

44
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:12,727
so I just got
some magazines and lipstick...

45
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:13,845
woman stuff.

46
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,263
Thanks.

47
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:18,466
All my parents got me was that.

48
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:19,984
Okay, well, I'm not very good

49
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,969
at visiting people
in hospitals,

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,105
so I'm going to go.

51
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:27,808
Hey, if you see Andy,
will you not tell him I'm here?

52
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,444
- Okay.
- Because of what happened,

53
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,012
- I don't want him to think...
- Stop.

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,181
Don't want to know.

55
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:35,583
The less I know
about other people's affairs,

56
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:36,751
the happier I am.

57
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,821
I'm not interested
in caring about people.

58
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,090
I once worked
with a guy for three years

59
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:44,092
and never learned his name...

60
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,794
Best friend I ever had.

61
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:49,997
We still never talk sometimes.

62
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,051
Mmm.

63
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:57,021
So we've developed
a revenue-sharing formula

64
00:02:57,106 --> 00:02:59,474
that will hopefully appeal
to most business owners.

65
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:00,708
Leslie!

66
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:02,643
Go home.
You're sick.

67
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,562
I'm not sick.
It's just allergies.

68
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,847
Come on, guys.
Just let me in there.

69
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:08,182
- No.
- You can't come in here.

70
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,517
You're not coming in.

71
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:11,486
Leslie, you look tired,
and you're all sweaty.

72
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,237
You look tired, and you're
all sweaty all the time.

73
00:03:13,322 --> 00:03:14,989
What's your excuse?
You want to go there, Jerry?

74
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,824
- No.
- Fine, I'm coming in.

75
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,993
Donna, barricade the door, now!

76
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:21,879
Donna, come on, just let me in.

77
00:03:21,964 --> 00:03:23,197
Un-uh.

78
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:25,333
Either go home,
or go back into quarantine.

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,034
I'm not going home.

80
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:28,869
Get out of here, Leslie.
Go home.

81
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,538
Hit the bricks.

82
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,743
Oh, come on.
No, no, no, no, no.

83
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:37,178
She's germing up all my stuff.

84
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,747
Aw, yuck.
Leslie!

85
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:44,068
- Ann Perkins.
- Hey.

86
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:45,269
How was your run?

87
00:03:45,354 --> 00:03:47,021
Ended
with a 51/2-minute mile,

88
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,239
my personal low.

89
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:50,608
I think the pavement
in this town is soft.

90
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:53,110
- What's with the mask?
- Flu prevention.

91
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:55,429
My body is finely tuned,
like a microchip.

92
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:57,165
And the flu is like
a grain of sand.

93
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:59,617
It could literally shut down
the entire system.

94
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:01,736
My body's like a chip too.

95
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:03,971
Potato chip.

96
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,089
No.

97
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:06,257
Speaking of potato chips,

98
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,242
you and I are on
for dinner tomorrow, yes?

99
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,410
Yes, definitely.

100
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,413
I'm super, super excited.

101
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,598
Looking forward to it.

102
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:15,416
Excellent.

103
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:19,554
Way to go, buddy.
Way to go.

104
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,189
We've been on a couple
of dates.

105
00:04:21,256 --> 00:04:22,440
I really like him.

106
00:04:22,524 --> 00:04:26,760
The problem is,
he's like a perfect human man.

107
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:29,597
I can't find one flaw.

108
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:32,766
There was one time
I thought he farted.

109
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,952
But it was me.

110
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:40,324
I need to find someone
to fill in for April.

111
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:42,843
Now, I know I'm not
gonna find someone

112
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:46,414
who's both aggressively mean
and apathetic.

113
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:49,850
April really is
the whole package.

114
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:51,819
But I think
I might know someone

115
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:54,555
who will be
just as ineffective.

116
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,645
Hello, Andrew.
What's new?

117
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,730
Um, a whole lot.

118
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:04,699
Check this out.
I just invented it...

119
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:05,933
super straw.

120
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:09,637
♪ ♪

121
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,205
Ahh.

122
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:14,442
So just sit here
and do your thing.

123
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:16,110
Do I have to tuck my shirt in?

124
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:18,012
Because, honestly,
that's kind of a deal breaker.

125
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,196
Let 'er fly.

126
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:20,581
Hey, wait.

127
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:21,982
Where's April?

128
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:23,551
Is she all right?

129
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:26,987
Yeah. I just gave her
the day off.

130
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,890
Would it be weird
if I asked for the day off?

131
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,343
Yeah, no. It's okay.
I didn't think so.

132
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:34,161
I'm sorry.
Are you leaving?

133
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,830
- I thought we had a meeting.
- No, we do.

134
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:37,865
It's just I think
it's a little chilly in here.

135
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,300
Are you okay?
Your eyes are glassy.

136
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:40,518
Oh, my God.
Oh, my...

137
00:05:40,602 --> 00:05:42,169
Is she... is she sick?
Are you sick?

138
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,273
- No.
- Yeah, she's sick.

139
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,907
That's why I'm wearing this

140
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:49,176
and misting myself
with hand sanitizer.

141
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:50,895
I am not sick.

142
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:52,680
I just have allergies, okay?

143
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,014
I took a Claritin,
and I threw that up.

144
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:55,716
So I took another one.
I threw that up.

145
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:57,702
And then I took a third,
and it stayed down.

146
00:05:57,786 --> 00:05:58,819
I'm getting better.

147
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,254
All right, you're burning up.

148
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:01,956
You're burning up.
What?

149
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,157
I have to get out of here.

150
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,042
I have 2.8% body fat.

151
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:06,410
My body's like a microchip.

152
00:06:06,495 --> 00:06:09,046
A grain of sand
could destroy it.

153
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:12,166
My body's a microchip.

154
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:13,200
Leslie, go home.

155
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,635
No, I can't.
I can't go home.

156
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:16,220
I have to get ready
for the Chamber of Secrets.

157
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,705
Commerce.

158
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,206
If this meeting
does not go perfectly,

159
00:06:19,274 --> 00:06:21,208
then the harvest festival's
gonna be over before it began.

160
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,543
I cannot go home.

161
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:25,896
- Okay, then who is your doctor?
- Ann's my doctor.

162
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,182
And she's the most beautiful
nurse in the world.

163
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,017
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

164
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:31,352
Now I'm hot.
Now it's really hot in here.

165
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,187
Okay, well, that's your fever.

166
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:35,856
Leslie, I typed your symptoms
into the thing up here,

167
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:39,610
and it says you could have
network connectivity problems.

168
00:06:39,695 --> 00:06:42,079
104.1.

169
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:44,365
Leslie, you're dehydrated.
I'm admitting you.

170
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,367
If I was sick, could I do this?

171
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:52,473
- What are you doing?
- Cartwheels.

172
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,808
Am I not doing them?

173
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,776
- No.
- Look, don't worry.

174
00:06:55,844 --> 00:06:57,778
I've done presentations
like this before,

175
00:06:57,846 --> 00:06:59,046
and Tom will be with me.

176
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:00,581
So you're in good hands.

177
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:03,551
It's not
that I don't trust Ben.

178
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:06,887
It's that I don't have
faith in Ben.

179
00:07:06,955 --> 00:07:10,391
And also, I'm starting
to forget who Ben is.

180
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:15,505
I'll handle the general outline
if you want to uh...

181
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,942
- Look.
- Just jump right in.

182
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,410
The worst thing you can do

183
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:20,446
with an important presentation
like this is over-prepare.

184
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:22,047
- Well...
- So...

185
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,816
I think it's best
if I go to the spa.

186
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:27,486
No, we promised Leslie
we'd prep for the meeting.

187
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:28,821
No, Ben, you promised Leslie.

188
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:31,106
See, I never promise
Leslie anything.

189
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,891
That way,
I never disappoint her.

190
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,043
I try to be considerate.

191
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,461
Well...

192
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:38,930
I am off for a soak
and a schvitz.

193
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,917
"Arrivederch."

194
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:50,275
Ron Swanson's office.

195
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:51,377
Yes.

196
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:53,379
I will transfer you.

197
00:07:57,851 --> 00:08:01,453
I just dropped another call.

198
00:08:05,842 --> 00:08:08,761
I thought you might like
a fresh set of pillows.

199
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:10,195
Are you trying to smother me?

200
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:12,464
Help!
The slutty nurse is trying

201
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:14,433
to smother me to death
with a pillow!

202
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:15,634
Okay, never mind.

203
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:17,519
Stay back, slut.

204
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,538
I know what she's trying to do.

205
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:20,939
She's trying to get me
to break.

206
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,941
And you know what?
I'm not gonna do it.

207
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,193
I'm gonna be professional,

208
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:26,045
and I'm gonna put on
a happy face,

209
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:27,613
and then I'm gonna
go into a supply closet

210
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,015
and snap a bunch
of tongue depressors.

211
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,818
Okay, so let's, um,
talk about your opening remarks.

212
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:34,553
Do you want me
to write you a rap?

213
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:35,854
I'll write you a rap.
No, you know what?

214
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:37,423
You're never gonna be able
to pull it off.

215
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,540
You're too white.

216
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,892
How about a show tune
or something?

217
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,961
I was just, uh, planning
to introduce myself...

218
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:44,296
Non-musically,

219
00:08:44,364 --> 00:08:46,532
and then get everyone
to refer to their packets,

220
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,500
and, uh, blah, blah, blah.

221
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,569
No.
No "blah, blah, blah," okay?

222
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:52,671
You need to go over
every single detail with me.

223
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:55,340
Leslie, I promise you,
I won't half-ass this, okay?

224
00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:56,775
Now get some rest.

225
00:08:56,843 --> 00:08:59,011
I have some great news.
I think my fever just broke.

226
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:00,696
Good-bye.

227
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:08,187
This came out.

228
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:09,388
Eh.

229
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:10,689
I am starving.

230
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,291
I haven't had lunch
since yesterday.

231
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:13,859
So I'm gonna head over
to Callahan's.

232
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,160
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go there.

233
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:16,695
They totally skimp on pickles.

234
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:18,530
Let me go
to Bighead Joe's for you.

235
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:20,999
They have
the most insane burritos.

236
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,935
I don't much go
for ethnic food.

237
00:09:23,002 --> 00:09:24,269
No, no, no.
Trust me.

238
00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:26,171
They have one that's called
the meat tornado.

239
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:28,424
Literally killed a guy
last year.

240
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:30,876
You had me
at "meat tornado."

241
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:36,014
What are you doing?

242
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,516
Hey, that flu medicine
really helped.

243
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,218
I feel
a thousand percent better.

244
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:40,652
Good as new.

245
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,654
Does this scarf look okay?
I don't want to look stuffy.

246
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,523
But I also don't want
to look too schlubby.

247
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:46,442
- Get back in that bed.
- So no to the scarf?

248
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:49,228
- Get back in the bed.
- No, I'm going to that meeting.

249
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:50,796
Either you get back in the bed,

250
00:09:50,864 --> 00:09:52,264
or I will strap you down.

251
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:55,033
I've done it before.
Don't test me.

252
00:09:59,956 --> 00:10:02,007
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.

253
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:04,243
Now, what superpower
would you rather have?

254
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,095
Would you rather be able to fly
or be invisible?

255
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,413
Ed, go first.

256
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:11,249
- Uh, fly, I guess.
- I forgot to tell you.

257
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,051
You can only fly five feet
above the ground.

258
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:17,589
I bring a certain panache
and spice

259
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:19,458
to the spa experience
for these guys.

260
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:21,894
Before I joined, they were just
three old white dudes

261
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:24,112
quietly boiling in hot water.

262
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:27,299
Would you rather live
in the pocket

263
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,935
of a giant kangaroo

264
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:33,539
or have a pocket
on your own stomach

265
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:36,441
that has a tiny kangaroo
in it all the time?

266
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:37,826
Preston.

267
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:40,245
Tiny kangaroo
in my stomach pocket.

268
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:43,282
Forgot to mention,
the tiny kangaroo is a racist.

269
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:47,619
Hey, Ann.

270
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,921
What happened?

271
00:10:48,972 --> 00:10:51,623
I just saw you a few hours ago,
and you were fine.

272
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,592
Not like, "damn, you're fine,"

273
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:55,227
but fine health-wise.

274
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:57,813
My body has no fat
to protect itself from disease.

275
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,898
Things happen very quickly.
Listen to me.

276
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:02,467
It's very important
that you replenish my body

277
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,986
with electrolytes

278
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,321
after every involuntary loss
of bodily fluids.

279
00:11:06,406 --> 00:11:08,073
- Oh, boy.
- My body tends to lose

280
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,909
a lot of fluids when it's sick.

281
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,828
My brain is on fire.
I'm dying.

282
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:15,814
Mm. Well, you definitely
have the flu.

283
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:18,250
Oh, my God.

284
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:20,452
The microchip
has been compromised.

285
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,423
Pierre Garcon
was a sixth-round pick.

286
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,259
Collie was the fourth round.

287
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:30,012
Indianapolis Colts
know how to draft so well.

288
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:31,263
They really do.

289
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,566
Andy, this was delicious.

290
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:35,801
It's awesome, huh?

291
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:39,304
It's a whole new
meat delivery system.

292
00:11:39,372 --> 00:11:40,639
Thank you, son.

293
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,507
What do you say
we go out to the parking lot,

294
00:11:42,575 --> 00:11:44,977
run a few pass plays
to burn off the calories?

295
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:48,180
You are an unstoppable
good-idea machine!

296
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:50,699
I like Andy.

297
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:52,718
I'm surrounded
by a lot of women

298
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:54,553
in this department.

299
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:57,022
And that includes the men.

300
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,826
Hup, hup, hup!

301
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:02,544
Peyton Manning
reading the defense!

302
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:03,862
Reggie Wayne, post corner!

303
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:13,889
Andy, wait up!

304
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:17,893
Hey, April.

305
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:20,879
I saw that you called for me.
What can I do for you?

306
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,182
- I need more flu medicine.
- Oh, an actual request.

307
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,118
Well, you can't have any.

308
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:28,353
That stuff is powerful...
no extra doses.

309
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:30,072
I didn't take any.

310
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:32,824
Leslie came in here
and stole it and left.

311
00:12:34,827 --> 00:12:36,078
Leslie?

312
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:39,748
Leslie!

313
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:41,300
Hey, have you seen Leslie?

314
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:42,868
I had a dream

315
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:45,070
that she came into this room,

316
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:48,607
stole my flu medicine,
told me not to tell you,

317
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:50,959
and then disappeared
through that hole in the wall.

318
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:52,644
The door?

319
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:55,413
Maybe we should get
a suite here for them, okay?

320
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:57,316
Ben Wyatt!
Hello!

321
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:58,750
Uh, hi, Leslie.

322
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,252
- Good to see you.
- You too.

323
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,604
Wow, you're really burning up.

324
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:03,805
Can I get some money

325
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,641
for the cab that I took
over here, please?

326
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:06,658
Sure.
How much?

327
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:07,659
I'm not sure.

328
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:08,860
I looked at the meter,

329
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:11,279
and it had
Egyptian hieroglyphics on it.

330
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,931
- Wow.
- Do you know the exchange rate?

331
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:14,816
So should we do this?

332
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:17,135
Oh, boy.
Hold on.

333
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:18,937
- Be careful.
- What?

334
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:22,441
The floor and the wall
just switched.

335
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:23,875
Okay.

336
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,078
Walk very carefully.

337
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:35,600
You know, I find it a little insulting

338
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,054
that you don't trust me
to handle this.

339
00:13:37,105 --> 00:13:39,390
It's not that
I don't trust you, okay?

340
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,159
It's just... This harvest festival
is my project.

341
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:44,295
It's my career on the line.

342
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:45,496
And I just need to make sure

343
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:48,933
that I've done everything I can
to make it work.

344
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,751
Okay.

345
00:13:50,836 --> 00:13:52,270
It's showtime.

346
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:53,871
Okay.

347
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:56,040
Good evening, everyone.
I'm Leslie Monster.

348
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,875
And this is Nightline.

349
00:13:57,926 --> 00:13:59,260
Okay, I wouldn't open
with that.

350
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:00,428
No?

351
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,280
- Why don't we sit down. Okay?
- Yep.

352
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:06,150
Libertarianism is all
about individual liberty,

353
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:07,551
and it should never be defined

354
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,937
by the terms "liberal"
or "conservative."

355
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,640
And communism is
no good, right?

356
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:13,641
That's right.

357
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,459
Big swing and a miss.

358
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:16,594
And what's the word

359
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:19,130
for when a few clerics are
in charge?

360
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:20,164
Religious oligarchy.

361
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:22,566
Holy [bleep].

362
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:24,952
- I can remember things.
- I guess.

363
00:14:25,037 --> 00:14:27,505
Mm, hey, keep mine rare.

364
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:30,658
A man after my own heart.

365
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:35,513
I vomited
somewhere in this room.

366
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,982
I don't remember where, though.

367
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,686
Wait. You might want to check
that drawer.

368
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:44,522
Stop...

369
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:45,990
Pooping.

370
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:48,159
You have to get up
off the floor now.

371
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:49,527
This floor is my friend.

372
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:52,096
Nothing like a complete
physical breakdown

373
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:54,899
to make a guy seem
less intimidating.

374
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,534
I love the flu.

375
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,019
And then I said,
"uh, you know what?

376
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:02,440
I think we need to get
these bananas out of here."

377
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:03,741
Have a seat, boys.

378
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:05,710
Oh, hey, Tom,
glad you could make it.

379
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:08,145
Uh, you have a nice day
with your spa buddies?

380
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:09,830
Actually, yes, Ben, I did.

381
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:11,515
And my spa buddies own

382
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:13,334
a couple of car dealerships
in town,

383
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:14,986
and they've agreed to donate

384
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:17,355
a fleet of vehicles
for harvest festival...

385
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:20,224
25 vans for the entire event.

386
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:22,560
Okay, Tom, I'm ready.
Get up there and introduce me.

387
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:23,928
You got it.

388
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:25,763
I can't let you
do this, Leslie.

389
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:28,799
Hey, this ain't
your call, McCluskey.

390
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:32,186
Hey, Ron,
can I ask you a question?

391
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,206
- Sure.
- It's about April.

392
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:38,509
I don't like to get involved
in people's personal...

393
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:41,729
I hurt her feelings,
and now she's pissed at me.

394
00:15:41,813 --> 00:15:43,347
I feel like
if I could just explain myself,

395
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:46,350
she'd understand,
but she's avoiding me.

396
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,586
It's making me miserable.

397
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:54,191
April's in the hospital,
sick with the flu.

398
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:55,209
What?

399
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:56,660
I knew it!

400
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:57,878
I didn't know that.

401
00:15:57,963 --> 00:15:59,830
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

402
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:01,665
You can go visit her
tomorrow morning.

403
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,217
But don't tell her I told you.

404
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:05,603
I won't.

405
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,372
No, no.
Nope.

406
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:09,373
Come here.
Ugh.

407
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:11,092
Ohhh!

408
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,545
Before we get started,
a quick announcement...

409
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:17,448
Every Thursday night
is ladies' night

410
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:20,851
down at the Snakehole Lounge
over on Burnham Avenue.

411
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:23,354
Ladies get two drinks
for the price of one.

412
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:24,922
Oh, no, that can't be right.

413
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,525
That's way too good of a deal.

414
00:16:27,576 --> 00:16:29,226
Nope.

415
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:31,278
That is what it says.

416
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:32,279
Wow.

417
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:33,748
That sounds like a fun time.

418
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,800
Anyway, uh,

419
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,501
it is now my great honor
to welcome to the stage

420
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:40,471
the woman responsible
for the entire harvest festival.

421
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,573
Ladies and gentlemen,
Leslie Knope!

422
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:56,920
Every one of you,

423
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:59,306
just by showing
up here tonight,

424
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,724
has already made history.

425
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:03,627
In days past,
the harvest festival

426
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:05,312
was the cornerstone

427
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,948
of Pawnee's
small-business community...

428
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,567
a weeklong showcase

429
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:12,903
for everything from textiles
to small farms.

430
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:15,122
By our estimates,
as many as 30,000 people

431
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:16,774
might attend the festival,

432
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:18,175
and the monetary value

433
00:17:18,243 --> 00:17:20,661
of that kind of direct
customer-to-business exposure

434
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:23,114
is, frankly, incalculable.

435
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,318
What?

436
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:28,853
Three, two, one.

437
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,304
And my shift's over.

438
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:32,289
What the [bleep]
is your problem?

439
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:33,958
Whoa, I thought
you weren't gonna lose it.

440
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,093
While I was on duty, I didn't.
Now it's just me.

441
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:38,529
I get that you're mad
that I kissed Andy, okay?

442
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:39,930
But it was a moment
of confusion,

443
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:41,298
and it was a mistake.

444
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:42,800
And I'm very sorry.

445
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:44,185
You want to hate me forever?

446
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:45,653
- Okay.
- Fine!

447
00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:47,037
You know what?
I don't care.

448
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:48,472
But you shouldn't take it out
on Andy,

449
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,974
because he really likes you,
and he did nothing wrong.

450
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:54,311
And just for the record,
I'm starting to hate you too.

451
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:59,783
That's the most
I've ever liked Ann.

452
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:01,869
The time is now.

453
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:04,004
The place is Pawnee.

454
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,323
Let's make history.

455
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,845
That was amazing.

456
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:12,496
That was a flu-ridden
Michael Jordan

457
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:14,698
at the '97 NBA finals.

458
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:16,333
That was...

459
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:18,135
Kirk Gibson
hobbling up to the plate

460
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:19,687
and hitting a homer
off of Dennis Eckersley.

461
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:22,840
That was...

462
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:25,576
That was Leslie Knope.

463
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:27,845
Thank you so much.
Any questions?

464
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:29,563
Yes, sir?

465
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:32,249
Are we going to get
the same sales-tax incentives

466
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:33,367
we used to?

467
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,286
That's a very good
question, sir,

468
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,355
and I would counter
with my own question, which is,

469
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:40,908
why is half of your face
all swirly?

470
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:42,393
Okay, um, unfortunately,

471
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,412
Leslie has another very
important meeting right now.

472
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:46,914
So if you have
any other questions,

473
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:48,699
you can just direct them,
uh, towards me.

474
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:49,917
Give it up, everybody,

475
00:18:50,001 --> 00:18:51,702
for Scott Bakula
from Quantum Leap.

476
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:54,138
All right.
Okay, let's...

477
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:56,006
Excuse me.

478
00:18:56,057 --> 00:18:58,609
Um, and to answer
your question, sir,

479
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:00,511
there will be
sales-tax incentives this year.

480
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,012
I think I should drive you
to the hospital.

481
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,681
Was I wearing a tiara
when I came in here?

482
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:05,216
Because if you happen upon it,

483
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:06,817
will you have Lady Pennyface
retrieve it

484
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:08,219
and send it posthence?

485
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:09,320
Chocolate-covered popcorn.

486
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,074
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, there.

487
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:16,327
I got you, uh,
some waffles here,

488
00:19:16,394 --> 00:19:18,195
courtesy of JJ's diner,

489
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:19,997
and chicken soup,
courtesy of me.

490
00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:21,916
- I'll take the waffles.
- Okay.

491
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,335
Thank you.

492
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:26,003
So how did the rest
of the meeting go?

493
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,923
Um, well, you said you needed

494
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:30,574
80 total businesses
to participate.

495
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,176
Yeah.

496
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:33,344
We have 110...

497
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,712
And counting.

498
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:37,080
So, uh, nice work, Leslie.

499
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,099
- Nice work to you too.
- Oh.

500
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:41,385
Uh, left the chicken soup there,
just in case.

501
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:43,637
It's an old family recipe.

502
00:19:43,722 --> 00:19:46,223
It's not a big deal, but...

503
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:48,392
- Thank you for that.
- Okay.

504
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:54,264
Hi, April.

505
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:56,150
It's me, Andy.

506
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,619
Just stay sleeping.

507
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:02,439
I am going to be here
when you wake up.

508
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:04,541
I will not leave your side.

509
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:13,834
You could be asleep for hours.
Maybe I'll come back later.

510
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:16,119
Hope you feel better.
Okay.

511
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:18,555
Oh, and I know you think
that I'm a jerk,

512
00:20:18,623 --> 00:20:21,258
but I hope you can forgive me.

513
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:26,563
Gross.
Your forehead is all sweaty.

514
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:28,148
That's gross.

515
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:32,069
But I still like you.

516
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:33,137
Okay.

517
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:35,138
Oh, that's disgusting.

518
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:43,774
Got your message.
What's up?

519
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,576
I got a call
from the boys upstairs.

520
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:47,826
And they have
a new assignment for us.

521
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,990
- Okay.
- Yeah.

522
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,487
And I feel like we should ask
for an extension to stay here.

523
00:20:52,806 --> 00:20:54,187
Yes, definitely.
You know...

524
00:20:54,307 --> 00:20:56,192
The festival thing's
getting pretty huge,

525
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,817
and, uh, couple loose ends
that need tying up.

526
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:01,177
Good, so I'll make the call,
then, to get the extension?

527
00:21:01,223 --> 00:21:02,680
- Yeah, they need our help.
- For the loose ends.

528
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,744
- Great.
