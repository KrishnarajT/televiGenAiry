00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:19,242
♪ Whoo-hoo! ♪

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,710
Hey, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:22,511
for the first time ever
in her new part-time job

4
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,179
in the Public Health Department
at City Hall,

5
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:26,181
it's Ann Meredith Perkins!
Yay!

6
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:28,282
Oh, Leslie, this is so nice!

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,284
I put a poisonous gas
in one of these balloons,

8
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:32,053
so if any of them pops,
you may die.

9
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:34,388
No, April, we would all die.

10
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:36,390
Gases fill the volume

11
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,860
of whatever container
they're in.

12
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:40,194
School.

13
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:42,896
We have activities every hour
on your first day.

14
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:44,865
10:00 A.M., Ann's first day
waffle explosion.

15
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:47,534
11:00 A.M.,
the start-paperwork jamboree.

16
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:48,869
And then 12:00 noon sharp

17
00:00:48,937 --> 00:00:51,839
is the inaugural
d-Ann-ce party.

18
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:54,108
Welcome to City Hall, cupcake!

19
00:00:54,175 --> 00:00:55,775
How many of you are in here?

20
00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:57,777
There are seven.
And you have an office mate.

21
00:00:57,845 --> 00:00:59,812
His name is Stuart,
and he's kind of a grouch.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,313
I have an office mate?

23
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:03,783
Get these [Bleep] balloons
out of here.

24
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:06,219
Hi. I'm Ann.

25
00:01:06,286 --> 00:01:16,286
Sync & corrections by Alice

26
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:27,538
- Hey.
- Hey.

27
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:28,939
Just to let you know,

28
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,608
I gave the senior center
project to Donna.

29
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,443
Sounds good.
The meeting's at 2:00?

30
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:33,944
Yes. Conference room "C".

31
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,013
Okay.
I think at some point,

32
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:38,683
you and I should probably
make out with each other.

33
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:39,917
Yeah, good call.

34
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:41,185
The best part
of any relationship

35
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:42,186
is the beginning.

36
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,155
No problems, no fights.

37
00:01:44,222 --> 00:01:47,056
Just white wine, cuddling,

38
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:51,295
and crazy amounts of
History Channel documentaries.

39
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,962
Hey, we should take
separate cars

40
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,063
to the restaurant tonight.

41
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,899
Chris is deadly serious
about this...

42
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,033
I know.

43
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:59,035
I just don't wanna talk
about it, okay?

44
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:00,136
I'll see you tonight.

45
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,937
Okay.
Oh, by the way,

46
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,508
I have a meeting
with Marlene Griggs-Knope.

47
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,810
Is that any relation?

48
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,145
- No.
- Oh, okay.

49
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,515
Just a coincidence.
We get it all the time.

50
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:13,683
We laugh about it.

51
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,217
But I've never met her.

52
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,718
- She's Filipino.
- Mm.

53
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:19,688
Okay, bye.

54
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,823
Why don't you ju t tell Ben
she's your mother?

55
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,024
Because Ben and I

56
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,026
are in this amazing
little bubble right now,

57
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:27,161
and there's no room in here

58
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,163
for Chris' stupid rules
about us not dating

59
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:30,532
or my ball-busting mother.

60
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,033
Oh, Leslie, I'm sorry,

61
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,701
but I don't think
you thought this through.

62
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:35,569
You know what I should do?
I should get my mother

63
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:37,571
a one-way ticket to London,
leaving today.

64
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,206
And that way,
Ben never has to meet her

65
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:40,874
and I could visit her
in London.

66
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,509
Everybody wins.

67
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:44,211
What if he sees
a picture of her on your desk?

68
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:45,546
What if Marlene says,

69
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:46,714
"Hey, have you met
my daughter Leslie?

70
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:48,181
She works
in the Parks Department."

71
00:02:48,249 --> 00:02:51,250
Stuart, please, could you
give us like 45 minutes?

72
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:53,519
- It's my office too.
- Stuart.

73
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:56,856
Boy, that guy was rude.

74
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:59,158
I feel that
some structural changes

75
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:01,594
could really unlock
this department's potential.

76
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:02,862
- Jerry.
- Hmm?

77
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:05,263
I believe you are capable
of much more.

78
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,265
- I'm not.
- Nonsense.

79
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,834
- Look in the mirror.
- What?

80
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:11,503
You are an intelligent,
charismatic,

81
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:13,538
beautiful superhero.

82
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:15,674
I'm making you
head of Public Relations,

83
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:18,176
which means you'll be leading
the daily briefing sessions.

84
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:19,711
Excellent idea.

85
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,379
This is my favorite part

86
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,381
about having
a new city manager.

87
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,383
They always try
to shake things up,

88
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,084
and their ideas are terrible,

89
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:30,388
and it brings City Hall
to a grinding halt.

90
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:32,055
I just grab a few donuts,

91
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:34,258
sit back, and enjoy the show.

92
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:37,126
April, you are too valuable

93
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:38,961
to just be Ron's assistant.

94
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:41,564
So from now on, you are
a multitasking executive aide,

95
00:03:41,632 --> 00:03:43,032
assisting the entire office.

96
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,300
Is this a nightmare?

97
00:03:44,368 --> 00:03:46,403
April, wake up.

98
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,771
Tom, I just wanna say

99
00:03:47,838 --> 00:03:50,273
that you are
a wonderful employee

100
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,241
and a terrific human being.

101
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,642
Meeting adjourned!

102
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:55,878
Tom.

103
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,546
I enjoy you.

104
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:00,048
You know what else I enjoy?
Your entrepreneurial spirit.

105
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,851
I did recently sell
my Chronicles of Riddick DVD

106
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,586
on eBay for $10.

107
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:06,588
Used the profits
to buy the Blu-Ray.

108
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:08,856
That's terrific.
I have an amazing project

109
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:09,990
for someone of your talents.

110
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:11,826
You are going to digitize

111
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:14,128
the entire city archives
up on the fourth floor.

112
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,530
No! I hate
the fourth floor!

113
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:16,997
Last time I was up there,

114
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:19,099
I saw someone buy crystal meth
out of a vending machine.

115
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:20,100
It's a bad place.

116
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,836
You won't be alone.
Andy.

117
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:23,170
Starting now,

118
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:25,104
you are nobody's shoeshine boy.

119
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:29,443
Starting now, you are
an administrative assistant.

120
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,645
For three weeks.
Then back to shoes.

121
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,647
Chris!

122
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:35,148
I wasn't super paying attention

123
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,416
to what you just said
that we'll be doing,

124
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,152
but I will give 110%!

125
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,486
Well, as soon
as you repeat yourself

126
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,187
in a more interesting way.

127
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,324
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, what's up?

128
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:47,359
Nothing much. Since I'm here,
I just wanted to let you know

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,794
that Marlene Griggs-Knope
is my mom.

130
00:04:48,862 --> 00:04:51,530
What? Wh.. why?

131
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:53,499
Also, she can be cruel
and difficult,

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
and she make snap judgments
about people

133
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,668
that she holds on to
for a very long time.

134
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:57,869
And she's kind of a bully.

135
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:59,604
Okay! Go in there
you're gonna be great.

136
00:04:59,638 --> 00:05:00,605
Oh God. Oh, my God.

137
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:02,640
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
Here... Sorry!

138
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,843
Hello.

139
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,644
I'm Mr. Ben Wyatt.

140
00:05:06,712 --> 00:05:08,446
Looks like you got some shirt
on your coffee.

141
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:10,114
Yeah. You know
what happened?

142
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:13,617
I spilled it,
but you know how it goes.

143
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:15,486
Fun anecdote.

144
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:17,087
The County School District

145
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:18,755
needs four new school buses.

146
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,524
I'm being stonewalled
by the board,

147
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,826
and I'm hoping your office
can help us out.

148
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:24,695
Okay.

149
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,530
Really? That's it?

150
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:30,032
Yeah.
Actually, no. It...

151
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,968
it's probably not possible.

152
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:33,970
Then I'm confused, Ben,

153
00:05:34,037 --> 00:05:35,538
because you
just told me it was.

154
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:36,772
Five seconds ago.

155
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,275
I got a second box of donuts,
if anybody...

156
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:43,713
What the [Bleep] is this?

157
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,347
This, Mr. Director,
is your new desk.

158
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,782
Okay...

159
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,283
This desk is the epitome

160
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:52,020
of the Swedish concept
of Jamstalldhet,

161
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:53,722
or "equality."

162
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,123
Imagine someone
needs your attention.

163
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,325
- Somebody say my name.
- Chris.

164
00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:58,827
Swivel!

165
00:05:58,895 --> 00:05:59,895
What is it, Jerry?

166
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:01,361
You told me to say your name.

167
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:02,963
And you did a great job,
superstar.

168
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:04,532
Someone else say something.

169
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:05,666
You look like a freak.

170
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,001
Swivel!

171
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:09,003
April, that is not
a very good attitude.

172
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,505
I will keep my eye on you

173
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:13,007
from my circular desk
where I can see everything.

174
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:15,475
Tiny swivel.
See how it works?

175
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:17,644
What about my office

176
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,913
and its many walls?

177
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,881
That becomes
a new public waiting room.

178
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,984
You're gonna be
more accessible than ever.

179
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,658
The fourth floor...
Small Claims Court,

180
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,059
divorce filings,
state-ordered drug tests.

181
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:36,528
It's somehow
both freezing and humid.

182
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,396
There's a whole room
on the fourth floor

183
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,566
where they store the knives
they've confiscated from people

184
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,768
who went to the fourth floor
to stab someone.

185
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,005
- You from parks and rec?
- Yeah.

186
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,006
I'm here to show you around.

187
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:50,775
Oh, nice to meet you, ma'am.
What's your name?

188
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:53,911
Ethel Beavers.
Follow me.

189
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,881
Okay, this is you.

190
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,183
Whoa!

191
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,652
Double computers?

192
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,353
I get my own office phone.

193
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:04,588
Hello, wall street.

194
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,890
Buy more stocks. Now.

195
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,424
This phone
kind of smells like a butt.

196
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,926
Try not to move things around,

197
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,327
'cause technically speaking,

198
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,096
this is still a crime scene.

199
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,098
Oh, here's your name tags.

200
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,967
Here.

201
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:19,502
Ethel, this shirt
is from theory.

202
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,403
Name tags make holes.
I'm not wearing this.

203
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:23,038
Well, do what you want.

204
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:25,340
Bye, Ethel!

205
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:26,541
Damn it.

206
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,143
Remind me next time
to ask her where she was

207
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:29,444
when Lincoln got shot.

208
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:33,215
Remind... Tom...
Ask... something.

209
00:07:33,282 --> 00:07:34,817
You got it, boss.

210
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,318
Hey! Somebody
made somebody a mix!

211
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:39,320
And I definitely heard
your feedback from last time,

212
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:41,322
so I only put five
Sarah Mclachlan songs

213
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:43,324
- on this one.
- Cool.

214
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:45,159
Should we talk about
how you claimed your mom

215
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,161
was a Filipino woman
you'd never met?

216
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:48,295
Should we?

217
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:52,066
I was just trying
to delay the inevitable.

218
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:54,601
If this turns
into something real,

219
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,137
then we are gonna have
to deal with Chris' rule,

220
00:07:57,204 --> 00:08:00,007
and parents,
and annoying flossing habits,

221
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,308
and a lot of un-fun stuff.

222
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:03,710
But not yet.

223
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:06,412
I just want to enjoy the bubble
for a little while.

224
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,615
I'm sorry.

225
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:09,949
Everything's good?

226
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:11,117
No, it's not.

227
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:12,618
I was completely flustered.

228
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,120
I came off like an idiot.

229
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,788
I mean, at one point,
for no reason,

230
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:18,691
I just took off my shoes
and held them in my hand.

231
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,859
I'm gonna go ask her
how it went,

232
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:21,527
and I bet she loved you.

233
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,329
I loved him!

234
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:27,331
He's a total pushover.

235
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,600
Very odd guy, though.

236
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,104
He's like a goofy,
spineless jellyfish.

237
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,174
Why do you ask, sweetheart?

238
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:37,842
No reason.

239
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:41,192
Don't worry about it.
It's totally fine.

240
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:42,460
No, it's not fine.

241
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:43,961
What if she starts going around
telling people

242
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,029
I'm a pushover?

243
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,196
No one's gonna believe that.

244
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:47,364
When I first met you,

245
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:49,233
I thought
you were a fascist hardass.

246
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,235
- What?
- A cute fascist hardass,

247
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,570
but still,
you give off a very...

248
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:55,439
Education department

249
00:08:55,507 --> 00:08:58,375
now officially requesting
ten school buses.

250
00:08:58,443 --> 00:09:00,076
I thought
they only wanted four.

251
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:03,246
Well, now that I'm a pushover,
why not ask for 10, or 20,

252
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:06,249
or 100 new school buses
and a fleet of school yachts?

253
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:07,517
- How about that?
- Hmm.

254
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:08,518
Here's what we're gonna do.

255
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,319
You are gonna tell me

256
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:11,987
everything there is to know
about your mom,

257
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,789
and I'm gonna have
another meeting with her,

258
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,158
and we're gonna have it out.

259
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:17,325
Or... we could go
to Belize

260
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:18,460
and go scuba diving.

261
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:19,861
And we could look
at the whale sharks.

262
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:23,065
You're certified, right?
Let's get you certified.

263
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:27,369
April, do you have
that usage report

264
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:28,636
that I asked for?

265
00:09:32,074 --> 00:09:35,176
- Anything for you, Jerry.
- Thank you.

266
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,678
Oh, come on!
Why?

267
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,513
Excuse me.

268
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:41,348
There's a sign at Ramsett Park

269
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,650
that says "Do not drink
the sprinkler water,"

270
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,086
so I made sun tea with it,

271
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,088
and now I have an infection.

272
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:48,921
Sir?

273
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,590
Sir, are... are... are...

274
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,092
are you listening to me, sir?

275
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,760
Sir, I'm talking to you!

276
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:55,928
Sir!

277
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,098
Sir, are you aware

278
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,433
that there is waste

279
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:02,469
in your water system?

280
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,670
Okay, you need to be strong,
powerful, decisive.

281
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,473
This is not a meeting.
It's a battle.

282
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,441
Normal meeting rules
do not apply.

283
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,775
I'll be my mom,

284
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,444
and I'm gonna be
very harsh with you,

285
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,313
and it's only because
I like you a lot.

286
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,615
- Okay.
- Go!

287
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,851
- Hello.
- Wrong.

288
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,185
- What?
- No preambles.

289
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,521
No introductions.
Just walk in and start talking.

290
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,757
I'd like to discuss
the new school bus.

291
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:29,627
I'd like to discuss
your rhyming, Dr. Seuss.

292
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,129
And you should be
sitting by now.

293
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:32,997
- Uh, what?
- Just walk in and take a seat.

294
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:34,332
Um...

295
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,066
"Um" is the sound
in "dumb."

296
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,634
That's what she says to people.

297
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,402
And now you've crossed your legs
like a woman.

298
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,737
God! Okay,
should we just start over?

299
00:10:40,804 --> 00:10:42,705
No. No, we need to put
a pin in this.

300
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,141
Here is a list

301
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,643
of my mother's top 100
favorite conversation topics,

302
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,844
starting with Persian rugs,

303
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:48,978
ending with Daniel Craig.

304
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:51,381
You have ten minutes
to memorize it.

305
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:53,582
- Deliverance the movie?
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,883
Oh, God.

307
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:57,586
So Jerry is,
like, basically my boss now...

308
00:10:57,654 --> 00:10:59,388
which I'm never
gonna work for him...

309
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,723
Ron's trapped
in this weird desk prison,

310
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,560
and I now work
at this traveling IV station.

311
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:06,895
This Mort Jansen's office?

312
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:08,130
Nope.

313
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:20,175
Tell Mort
I said "your move."

314
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,878
Oh, my God. I wanna work
up here with you guys.

315
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,046
This is awesome.

316
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:28,382
How many more of those stupid
documents do you have to scan?

317
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:29,883
Just this one,

318
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,719
and all the ones
in those boxes.

319
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:34,655
I gotta get out of here pronto.

320
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,823
Time to get those old ladies
to do my work for me.

321
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:37,924
How?

322
00:11:37,992 --> 00:11:39,293
By shining down on 'em

323
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,826
with the Haverford charm ray.

324
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:42,428
Wah-wah wah-wah wah-wah...

325
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:44,530
Well, well, well,

326
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:46,532
if it isn't Ethel Beavers.

327
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,367
What's up, beautiful?

328
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,869
Julianne Moore just called.
She wants her hair back.

329
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:55,040
Nobody named Julien called.

330
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,508
Never mind.
I just need to ask you

331
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:57,909
a couple of questions.

332
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:01,446
One, can you help me out
with this project we're doing?

333
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:04,449
And, two,
will you please invite me

334
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,585
to your 30th birthday party?

335
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:10,788
What are you doing?

336
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,289
I'm making a test call
to your phone

337
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,524
to make sure it's working

338
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:15,859
so you don't miss
any more calls.

339
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,027
You know what?
Don't bother.

340
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:18,362
Maybe I'll just find
an open window

341
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,365
- and plummet to my death.
- Okay.

342
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,869
This...
isn't gonna work.

343
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:28,505
Okay, you did not
just swivel away

344
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:29,272
while I was talking to you.

345
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,109
This spaceship keyboard
is driving me crazy.

346
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:34,944
I'm down to one word a minute,

347
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:36,479
and the word is
"perflipitusclub,"

348
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,048
because I can't fly spaceships.

349
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:41,351
Donna, you know as well as I do

350
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:43,553
these city manager shakeups
always Peter out.

351
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:46,255
- You just have to wait.
- Usually I'm with you.

352
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:48,990
But this is Chris Traeger,
the Six Million dollar Man.

353
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:50,325
He won't quit.

354
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:52,494
So you need to swivel your ass
down to his office

355
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,129
and have a word with him.

356
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:55,464
Mommy.

357
00:12:55,531 --> 00:12:57,132
Oh!

358
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,968
Oh, that is
so thoughtful of you.

359
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,470
Of course!

360
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:03,837
I just figured, hey,

361
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:05,973
why not put my mother
in a good mood?

362
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,409
So it's my understanding

363
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:10,778
that despite what I said
in our meeting,

364
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:13,113
you have somehow increased
your request

365
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:14,248
for more school buses.

366
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:15,583
Excuse me,

367
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:17,850
but I'm having coffee
with my daughter.

368
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,185
Maybe we could do this
another time.

369
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,220
No, we're gonna talk
about this now.

370
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:23,856
Or if you'd prefer,

371
00:13:23,924 --> 00:13:25,425
I could put a permanent freeze
on the education budget.

372
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:27,093
It's your call.

373
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:28,595
Wow, maybe you
should talk to him, mom.

374
00:13:28,663 --> 00:13:31,464
He seems
pretty self-assured.

375
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:34,132
There's nothing left.

376
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,467
It's over.

377
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:37,135
Hey, hey, hey, don't say that.

378
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:38,804
Now, come on.

379
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,306
Get yourself together

380
00:13:40,373 --> 00:13:41,707
and go out there
and be the woman

381
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,843
you always knew you could be.

382
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:48,613
Thank you so much.

383
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:50,114
Who was that?

384
00:13:50,182 --> 00:13:51,282
I don't know.

385
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,818
I saw her crying,
and so I helped.

386
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,120
What did you
wanna talk to me about?

387
00:13:56,188 --> 00:13:58,155
Look, Chris, I'm very flattered

388
00:13:58,223 --> 00:14:00,391
you thought of me
for this amazing opportunity,

389
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:03,127
but I don't really know
if this gig is in my wheelhouse.

390
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:05,662
I tend to work best
with young, attractive people.

391
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,332
Tom, I have made you
a project leader.

392
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,566
This is a big deal!

393
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,668
You should keep an open mind.

394
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:14,170
Let your brain unlock the door
to your heart's future.

395
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:16,340
I made that expression up
when I was 14.

396
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,342
Still in use today.
By me.

397
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,576
Gotta jam.

398
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:22,511
You know what?
It's just not possible.

399
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:24,179
And don't even bother trying
to outflank me either,

400
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:25,614
because you will fail.

401
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,883
Where did all this confidence
come from all of a sudden?

402
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,852
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's relax.

403
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,721
- You know, Ms. Griggs-Knope...
- Marlene.

404
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,988
There's probably
a compromise here.

405
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:35,424
"Compromise is usually
a sign of weakness."

406
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:37,158
Yes, it is,
according to Andrew Carnegie.

407
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,561
But your demands remind me
of a different quote,

408
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,995
from the great Bill Watterson...

409
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:44,566
"you need a lobotomy.
I'll get a saw."

410
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,235
I love Calvin and Hobbes.

411
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:49,871
Me too!

412
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:52,706
I gotta say,
this is some of my best work.

413
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,140
This could not
have gone better.

414
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,477
They are really hitting it off.

415
00:14:56,544 --> 00:14:59,580
Thank God.
Crisis averted.

416
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:03,660
Well, I am very glad
you came back up here.

417
00:15:04,544 --> 00:15:05,660
Oh...

418
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:06,741
Yeah, me too.

419
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,360
- Yeah, uh...
- So you have a deal.

420
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:10,028
Well, let me
mull everything over,

421
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:13,932
and then we can reconnect
and hash things out.

422
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,934
It might get rough,
but that can be fun.

423
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,603
- Ben can handle it.
- Yup, I can.

424
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:19,871
Okay, great.

425
00:15:19,905 --> 00:15:23,007
- It was a pleasure.
- Oh, mm-hmm.

426
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,110
What's so great
is she was impressed by you too.

427
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:27,945
I mean, you could tell instantly
that the way you guys

428
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,113
were connecting
was really amazing.

429
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,614
Now, what I'm thinking
is that maybe

430
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:31,749
we should go over
to her house...

431
00:15:31,816 --> 00:15:34,051
you two are
just the cutest things

432
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:35,118
on four legs!

433
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,254
- Aw.
- But why so much black?

434
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,055
It's like you're going
to a funeral.

435
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:42,025
- She's got a point, babe.
- So marry her then.

436
00:15:42,093 --> 00:15:43,760
I wish!

437
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:45,962
Hey, sorry to interrupt
the love fest,

438
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,764
but can you hand me that
folder there, please, Ethel?

439
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:50,200
Oh, great.

440
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:52,034
Why you gotta be
like that, Ethel?

441
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:54,203
Looks like someone got up
on the wrong side of the crib.

442
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:57,072
Stop laughing, Muriel.

443
00:15:58,308 --> 00:15:59,741
Stop it!

444
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:01,777
I gotta say, I'm a genius.

445
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:03,612
The only thing my mom loves
more than music boxes

446
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,214
is McSteamy
from Grey's Anatomy.

447
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:06,715
So I made her...

448
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,749
A McSteamy-style music box,

449
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,018
and I thought maybe
you could give it to her.

450
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,252
She would love you for it.

451
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,721
I think maybe
that's not such a good idea.

452
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:15,089
Why?

453
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:16,958
I mean, it's not
the best picture of him, but...

454
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:20,728
Your mom kind of...

455
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:22,630
Um...

456
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:24,831
Made a pass at me.

457
00:16:27,101 --> 00:16:29,336
So Webster's dictionary

458
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,538
describes a pork as a...

459
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:34,007
no, it's park... park.

460
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:36,776
I'm sorry.
Geez, okay. So...

461
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:38,845
You know what,
can we start over?

462
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,180
Let's... let's go from
the first thing I said... pork...

463
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:42,781
which, by the way,

464
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,451
they have a great pork sandwich
in the cafeteria today.

465
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,619
- Ron Swanson.
- Chris.

466
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:50,122
You have come up with a plan

467
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,191
so spectacularly horrible

468
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,327
that it might ruin
the entire department.

469
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:55,660
- Now, wait a minute.
- No, I mean that

470
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:56,727
as a compliment.

471
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,097
SO it pains me to say this...

472
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:01,499
My department has to go back
to the way it was.

473
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,168
Give 'em time.
They'll adjust.

474
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,636
No, they won't.
They're miserable.

475
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:09,040
Tom only performs
when there's someone to impress,

476
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,808
so marooning him
on freak island

477
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:12,209
isn't helping anyone.

478
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,979
And you made April
assistant to everyone?

479
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:17,147
You know who April hates?

480
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:19,116
Everyone.

481
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:21,718
And Jerry can only function
if no one's looking.

482
00:17:21,786 --> 00:17:22,987
You shine a light on him,

483
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:25,755
and he shrinks up faster
than an eskimo's scrotum.

484
00:17:25,823 --> 00:17:27,457
Well, that's
very perceptive, Ron.

485
00:17:27,524 --> 00:17:29,327
And... very graphic.

486
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,063
I understand your point,

487
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:33,363
but there's no way that
I get just rolled-over on this.

488
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,433
Okay.

489
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,402
You won't ever hear me
say this again,

490
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,737
so savor this moment.

491
00:17:43,306 --> 00:17:45,707
I may have a compromise.

492
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,942
Look, she was just
flirting a little.

493
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:50,412
I'm sure she's not
really interested in me.

494
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,414
Oh, my God. I can't even
have this conversation.

495
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:54,449
The whole thing
is screwed up now.

496
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:56,485
There's so many ways
to destroy a bubble,

497
00:17:56,552 --> 00:17:59,586
but my mom flirting with you
is number one on the list.

498
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:01,788
And I'm sorry,
I have to say this...

499
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:03,757
Were you asking for it
in any way?

500
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:05,126
No!

501
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:06,593
- How were you dressed?
- Oh, my God.

502
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:08,529
- I was wearing this.
- Here's what we do.

503
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:10,131
You issue
a government-wide memo

504
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:12,233
about sexual harassment,
and then you go to Mexico.

505
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,068
Just for a couple of weeks.

506
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,736
Where are you going?
Ben!

507
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:18,971
Ben! Wait.
Just k...

508
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,873
Hey.
Hi, mom.

509
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,309
- Hi again.
- Leslie and I are dating.

510
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:25,045
We haven't told anyone

511
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:27,480
because there's a rule
against office relationships,

512
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:29,115
but it's happening.

513
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:31,450
I'm sorry we didn't tell you
before you touched my knee,

514
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:33,118
and I trust
you won't tell anyone now,

515
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,254
since it could get
your daughter fired.

516
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:44,663
That is hilarious.

517
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,298
That's what we thought too.

518
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:49,800
Well...

519
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:52,470
Four buses.

520
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:55,273
- Two.
- Deal.

521
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:00,978
I like this one.

522
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:03,180
Me too.

523
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:05,348
You keep your hands off him.

524
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:09,018
Margaret's pecan squares.

525
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,455
They are like crack.
I brought you one.

526
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:12,956
How are you so happy
working here?

527
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,324
I don't know, man.
It's not that bad.

528
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:15,792
A year ago I lived in a pit.

529
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:18,528
Now I got a job,
and a kickass wife,

530
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:21,230
and my band is so good,

531
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:23,932
and are you gonna eat
that pecan square?

When life gives you lemons,
make lemonade.

533
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:34,510
I read that once
on a can of lemonade.

534
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:37,945
I like to think
that it applies to life.

535
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:41,382
Here you go.

536
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,618
Thank you.

537
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,625
Kind of figured you'd
be back in your office by now.

538
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:53,227
Well, you know
how new city managers are.

539
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:55,862
Seems like everyone else
is back to normal.

540
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:58,632
How long
do you have to do this?

541
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,900
A week.

542
00:20:00,968 --> 00:20:03,570
Citizen request.
Swivel, swivel, swivel.

543
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:06,406
Hello. I can help you
in here, sir.
