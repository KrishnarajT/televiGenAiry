1
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:59,657
I need you guys to come
to the Snakehole Lounge tonight

2
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:00,591
to help me with something.

3
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:01,939
Yeah, no, tonight's not good.

4
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:03,018
No can do.

5
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,185
I'm on a cleanse.

6
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:05,887
Please.
This is important.

7
00:01:05,955 --> 00:01:09,557
I'm launching my new high-end,
Kahlua-style liqueur,

8
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,059
"Snakejuice".

9
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:14,029
Sounds like you took a snake
and twisted it like a rag

10
00:01:14,096 --> 00:01:15,930
until its blood
and guts came out.

11
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:17,699
Ha ha ha.
Eww.

12
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:19,000
What does Kahlua-style mean?

13
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:20,402
I mix a bunch
of alcohol together,

14
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:22,570
I add some sugar and coffee
and some other junk,

15
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:24,272
and it kind of tastes
like Kahlua.

16
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,675
I can only drink warm
tap water with cayenne pepper.

17
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,176
Fine.
Then don't drink it.

18
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:30,011
Just get other people
to drink it, okay?

19
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,413
Meeting in one hour.

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,115
If you don't make it,
you're on my done-zo list.

21
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:36,184
Uh, what's a done-zo list?

22
00:01:36,252 --> 00:01:38,920
It means you and I
are done-zo...

23
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:40,789
Hanging out, getting food
together, done-zo.

24
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:42,557
You want to come over to
my house and play video games?

25
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,858
Done-zo.

26
00:01:43,926 --> 00:01:45,560
Hey, tom, you want to come play
putt-putt with me?

27
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:47,662
No, we're done-zo.

28
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,198
Babe, we got to make
that meeting.

29
00:01:50,266 --> 00:02:00,201

30
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:12,821
All right, let's start
with the personal stuff.

31
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:14,322
- How's jessie?
- Who?

32
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,291
- The photographer guy.
- Oh, yeah.

33
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:18,159
We broke up.
I didn't tell you that?

34
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:20,528
- Mm-mm! Why? I liked him.
- Yeah, I did too.

35
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:22,430
I just... I couldn't deal
with his face.

36
00:02:22,498 --> 00:02:23,932
Huh.

37
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:26,134
Do you think I could get that
book back that I loaned him?

38
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:29,037
Oh, well, I'm technically
"out of the country."

39
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:32,140
So I would have to call him
from a weird number.

40
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,541
- Oh.
- Sorry.

41
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:34,642
Never mind.

42
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,211
But I'm seeing
this new guy, Mattias.

43
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:38,813
You would love him.
He's a triple pisces.

44
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:40,648
Uh-oh, looks like someone's
gonna be late for her meeting.

45
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:41,950
I'll race you.

46
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:43,752
Really?
Isn't that a little childish?

47
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,520
Oh, ha ha ha.
Bye, Ann.

48
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,055
Sorry, got to go.
Hey, move!

49
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:48,556
Oh!
Councilman Howser, sorry.

50
00:02:48,624 --> 00:02:50,558
Nice to see you as always.

51
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:52,494
Bye.

52
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,696
Welcome to
Guerilla Marketing 101.

53
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:56,698
What is Guerilla Marketing?

54
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:58,566
A few ordinary schmoes...
no offense...

55
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:01,169
have a casual conversation
next to some guy

56
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,104
about how great Snakejuice is.

57
00:03:03,172 --> 00:03:05,273
Next thing you know that guy

58
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:06,875
orders an whole bottle
of Snakejuice,

59
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,276
and he has no idea why.

60
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:12,614
Ron is going to play our
exciting Snakejuice drinker,

61
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:15,717
AKA Brian Thunder.

62
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:17,619
Jerry, you'll be playing
a boring beer drinker.

63
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:18,953
Your name will be Jerry.

64
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:23,358
Your talking points are
high-end, VIP, lifestyle.

65
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,193
All right, let's run
through it once.

66
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:27,028
And action!

67
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:29,798
"The weather has been
so weird lately.

68
00:03:29,865 --> 00:03:31,866
Hey, let me buy
you all a drink."

69
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:34,869
"I'll take something basic
like a beer."

70
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,604
"Yeah, I'm pretty...

71
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:38,840
boring."

72
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,942
So I'll take a beer, too."

73
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,612
"Not me. I want this night
to get ca-razzy."

74
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,181
Ca-raaazy.

75
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:49,184
Like crazy.

76
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:52,921
"I want this night
to get ca-razy.

77
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,756
"Get me a shot of Snakejuice.

78
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,891
I hear it has
a dope aftertaste."

79
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,393
All right,
that's gonna be a cut.

80
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,162
Um, Ron, you got to say it
like you mean it.

81
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,031
I won't publicly endorse
a product

82
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:06,601
unless I use it exclusively
and I really believe in it.

83
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:08,336
My only official
recommendations are.

84
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:10,738
U.S. Army-issued
mustache trimmers,

85
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:13,708
Morton's Salt,
and the C.R. Laurence Fein

86
00:04:13,776 --> 00:04:17,045
two-inch, axe-style scraper
oscillating knife blade.

87
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:19,414
We need to find
a new PR Director

88
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:20,548
for the Health Department.

89
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:22,183
Dennis Cooper was fired today.

90
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:23,852
Why?

91
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,453
Short answer...
he went bananas.

92
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:28,089
Long answer...
his wife, Jan, had an affair,

93
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:29,691
gave him a venereal disease,

94
00:04:29,758 --> 00:04:31,726
and so he put signs about her
all through City Hall.

95
00:04:31,794 --> 00:04:32,894
I'm sure you've seen them.

96
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:34,195
Oh, yeah.

97
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:36,331
"Jan Cooper will give you
chlamydia,

98
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:38,099
brought to you by
the Pawnee Health Department."

99
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,935
"Chlamydia affects
nearly 100% of Jan Coopers."

100
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:43,805
"The department of health
congratulates Jan Cooper,

101
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:45,139
Miss Chlamydia."

102
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:47,475
"Jan, I love you.
Please come back.

103
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:50,111
"I realize
that I'm not blameless here.

104
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:53,848
"Please.

105
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,416
Brought to you
by the Health Department."

106
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:58,286
"Re-elect Jan Cooper,
Mayor of Whoreville."

107
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:01,289
Leslie, I want you to help us
choose a replament.

108
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,625
Parks and Health work closely
on outdoor programs

109
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,526
and exercise initiatives.

110
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:06,794
- Ann should do it.
- Ann Perkins?

111
00:05:06,862 --> 00:05:09,697
Pawnee is looking
for a new PR Director

112
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:11,065
for the Health Department,
and I submitted your name.

113
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:13,801
You have an interview tomorrow
at 9:00 A.M.

114
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:15,470
9:00 A.M. wow.

115
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:17,071
Yes, I know.
I couldn't get it earlier.

116
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:18,606
- I'm... I am...
- Grateful.

117
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:20,041
I know.
You can thank me later.

118
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,476
But first you need
to go over your homework.

119
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:23,044
These are all
the health initiatives

120
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:26,047
the city has ever undertaken
since the 1960s.

121
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:28,082
So you need
to partially memorize that.

122
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,918
And it's gonna be a long night,

123
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,286
so I got you some energy drinks

124
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:33,788
and some chocolate-covered
espresso beans

125
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,690
and the book Freedom
by Jonathan Franzen.

126
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:36,858
Why am I reading this?

127
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:38,259
Because I'm almost
done with it, Ann.

128
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:39,794
And I want to talk to you
about Patty.

129
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:42,163
Okay, deep breath.

130
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:45,266
Okay, I've been a nurse
for over 10 years.

131
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:46,801
It's not something
you just quit.

132
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:48,970
I understand.

133
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,006
I just think with this new job,
you could make a difference.

134
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:53,942
Make real change happen.

135
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,244
Plus, we'd be working
in the same building...

136
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:59,013
no more lightning-round
catch-up sessions.

137
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,449
It would be nice
to have an office.

138
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,084
And let's be honest,
it would be nice to not have

139
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:04,786
to pull strange things out
of people's butts every night.

140
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:07,021
You've mentioned that before.
That doesn't happen that often.

141
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,423
- It happened once.
- Just once.

142
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,325
That already is too many times.

143
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:13,494
Ugh. I hate talking

144
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:15,496
to people about things.
This is a nightmare.

145
00:06:15,564 --> 00:06:18,032
Ugh.
I'm grouchy.

146
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,767
Well, we have to support Tom.

147
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:22,136
Think about it
as role-playing.

148
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,772
That makes it sexy.

149
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,508
- That could be fun.
- Ha! Really?

150
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:29,610
Can I use a weird voice
and try to freak people out?

151
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:32,113
- Yes.
- Okay.

152
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:34,215
Then, uh, next time you see me,

153
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:37,118
I'll be a stranger.

154
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,853
Oh...

155
00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:43,091
Snakejuice!
What? Here?

156
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:46,194
High-end, VIP, exclusive.

157
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:48,930
- Hey, how's it going?
- I think it's going okay.

158
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:51,265
People better buy this stuff,
or else I'm gonna be screwed.

159
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,934
It's gonna be fine.
People will definitely buy it.

160
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:54,035
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

161
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:56,004
♪ "K" to the "N"
to the O-P-E ♪

162
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:59,774
♪ she's the dopest little shorty
in all Pawnee, Indiana ♪

163
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,342
Why didn't you just stop
at "Pawnee"?

164
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,945
Leslie Knope, seriously,
you get sexier every day.

165
00:07:04,013 --> 00:07:05,847
And that is not a line.
That is for real.

166
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:07,615
Aw, Jean-Ralphio.

167
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:09,851
Well, I-I know tonight's
gonna be a big success,

168
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:11,019
and I wish I could stay.

169
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:12,420
I really do,
but I have to go help Ann.

170
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:13,588
She's gonna be up all night

171
00:07:13,655 --> 00:07:14,989
cramming
for a big job interview.

172
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:16,324
She might be up all night,

173
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:18,159
but I think someone else

It's 140 proof,

But don't worry.

299
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,370

346
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:36,070
Good! It's not all my fault.
I'm not the stupid jerk.

347
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:37,872
I'm not the one who's being
a stupid jerk right now.

348
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:38,939
I didn't mean it like that.

349
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:40,374
You know
I didn't mean it like that.

350
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:41,909
I just meant you were
being stupid,

351
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:43,411
and you were acting
like a jerk.

352
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:46,147
Look, I'm sorry that I thought
about you for the job, okay?

353
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:48,416
But sometimes if I don't push
you in the right direction,

354
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:49,784
you end up standing still.

355
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:51,786
I was just trying
to do you a favor.

356
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:54,855
Enough with your favors, okay?

357
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:56,624
Stop.

358
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:02,963
Maybe we shouldn't work
together, then.

359
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,299
Maybe we shouldn't.

360
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:11,105
Every time I cleanse,
I can literally

361
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:12,940
feel the toxins leaving my body.

362
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:14,875
I know!
I feel so much healthier.

363
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:17,712
I've still got a full week
to go before the broth stage.

364
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,682
Mmm! Pre-broth
is an amazing stage.

365
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,350
It's when you're most alert.

366
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:25,386
Good. Someone
needs to be alert tonight.

367
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:28,355
This Snakejuice
is basically rat poison.

368
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,924
Everybody's wasted.

369
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:32,493
You don't even know one thing.
I didn't even say one thing.

370
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:33,861
And then she asked me
the whole thing,

371
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:35,229
and I didn't even do it once.

372
00:14:35,297 --> 00:14:37,264
I'm like an elephant, okay?

373
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:40,568
If I walk into a room,
it's like, okay, he's in there.

374
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:45,372
Baba booey.

375
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,141
Turn this music down.

376
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:52,079
♪ Farts and poop and love
and stuff ♪

377
00:14:52,147 --> 00:14:55,683
♪ macaroni salad ♪

378
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:04,692
♪ ♪

379
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,094
- Is this everybody?
- Ann took a cab.

380
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:09,430
Tom's in the trunk.
Jerry's on the roof.

381
00:15:09,498 --> 00:15:11,432
All right, where to first?

382
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,100
Your mother's butt.

383
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,271
I'm so alone.

384
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,774
If even one of you thinks
about dry heaving in my car,

385
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:21,342
you're all walking home.

386
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:27,289
Leslie.

387
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,639
I'm here.

388
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:32,874
We have to go hire
a new PR Director

389
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,142
for the Health Department.

390
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,044
Oh, my God.
I'm so hungover.

391
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:37,545
I've never been this hungover.

392
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,814
I feel great.
I ran 5k this morning.

393
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:40,882
Really?

394
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,884
No, I threw up in the shower.

395
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:44,986
Top of the morning, everyone.

396
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:48,690
I brought
some burgers and fries.

397
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:49,858
Eat up.

398
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:52,227
The protein soaks up the sugar.

399
00:15:53,763 --> 00:15:56,965
First, you take the cow
to the killing floor.

400
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,868
Well, I am out of questions.

401
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:03,872
Thank you.
We will let you know.

402
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,974
Then our heads will explode,
and we will die.

403
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:07,709
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

404
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:10,211
I cannot believe that fight
I had with Ann.

405
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,547
Look, I'm sure you guys
can work it out.

406
00:16:12,615 --> 00:16:15,717
I owe her, like,
a million apologies.

407
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:17,852
I think I owe you one, too.

408
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,622
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

409
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:23,091
I don't know.

410
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,759
Are you okay?

411
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:29,030
No, I'm sad.

412
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:37,372
- Say, thanks, chum.
- Ugh.

413
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,140
I'll get those papers
delivered for you...

414
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,809
Whatever.

415
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,511
Posthaste.

416
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:46,815
The doctor says it's probably
not serious, but it might be.

417
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:50,185
Oh, Kyle, please stop talking.

418
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,220
Why, isn't it Bert Macklin?

419
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:54,456
What are you doing here,
and who is this sorry Charlie?

420
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:56,324
I'm Janet Snakehole.

421
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,159
I demand answers,
and I want them now.

422
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,861
Honey, please.
I love you.

423
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:03,298
No offense, but Bert Macklin
died last night

424
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,567
after the tenth shot
of Snakejuice.

425
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:11,806
Okay, sorry.

426
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:13,808
Miss Snakehole.

427
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,979
You think I'd let you
get away that easily?

428
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:20,515
Bert Macklin may be dead,

429
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:25,286
but I'm his brother
Kip Hackman.

430
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,689
Why wouldn't you have
his same last name?

431
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:29,290
Shut up, Kyle.

432
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:32,026
I know you boosted
those paintings.

433
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:35,230
Maybe it was me, but I'll
never tell you where they are.

434
00:17:35,297 --> 00:17:37,632
And you'll never have
my body either.

435
00:17:43,172 --> 00:17:44,506
Sorry to hear the news, Tom.

436
00:17:44,573 --> 00:17:46,441
We're gonna miss you
around the club.

437
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:49,010
Hey, you own shares, too.
Why didn't Chris make you sell?

438
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:50,779
'Cause Chris doesn't know.

439
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,514
You know what?

440
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:55,083
Snitches get stitches.

441
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:58,319
- Donna, come on.
- Don't.

442
00:17:58,387 --> 00:17:59,687
I'm a natural moneymaker.

443
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:02,290
I got into government
for the connections.

444
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:04,793
This was supposed to be a thing
that led to the other thing.

445
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,594
It's like when Vin
Dboiler room.

446
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:08,163
That's what lead to him
being XXX and doing Furious.

447
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,497
And Furious.
Yeah, I know.

448
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,266
Listen, I don't like
all this negativity, man.

449
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:14,636
Why don't you turn that
frizz-own upside-dizz-ity?

450
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:16,337
Huh?
This sucks, man.

451
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,142
Oh.

452
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,578
You're wearing snow pants.

453
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,013
I got home last night,

454
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,315
and I thought
I might go sledding.

455
00:18:28,784 --> 00:18:29,884
Can I come in?

456
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:31,920
- Yeah, if you're quiet.
- Okay.

457
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:36,124
Uh, Leslie doesn't know
I'm here.

458
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:39,294
Oh, God.
So high school...

459
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,763
I can't believe that Leslie
and I got drunk in a bar

460
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:43,097
and fought about boys.

461
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,133
We're so much better than that.

462
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,535
I just keep having flashes
of things

463
00:18:47,603 --> 00:18:50,104
that we said to each other.

464
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,574
And she's so important to me.

465
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:54,476
I feel like such a dick.

466
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:56,177
I know she feels awful.

467
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:59,147
I mean, technically, we all do.

468
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:01,883
Yeah. What the hell
is in Snakejuice...

469
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,117
Demerol?

470
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,119
All I know is
Leslie's always talking

471
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,122
about how lucky she is
to have you as a friend.

472
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,861
And I just wanted you
to know that.

473
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:14,963
You're nice.

474
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,965
I can see why she likes you.

475
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,801
When did she say...
likes me?

476
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:21,402
Oh, God.
This is so high school.

477
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,739
Just rent a limo,
ask her to the prom.

478
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:26,074
I'm sure she'll say yes.

479
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:28,309
All right.
Thanks.

480
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:30,578
So let me get this straight.

481
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:32,914
Tom tries to get off
the Government teat,

482
00:19:32,982 --> 00:19:34,148
and we punish him.

483
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,917
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

484
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:38,152
I'm sorry.
Rules are rules.

485
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,255
I wish there was something
we could do.

486
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:42,390
Ben, is there something
we can do?

487
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,925
Damn it.
Ben's not here.

488
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:45,660
Tom's not scamming anyone.

489
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:47,996
He's not savvy enough to
manipulate the system like that.

490
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,199
He's just a kid
chasing a goofy dream.

491
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:55,236
I'm sorry.
My hands are tied.

492
00:19:55,304 --> 00:19:57,839
Jan Cooper was a terrible wife.

493
00:19:57,907 --> 00:19:59,707
I just want everybody
to know that.

494
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:01,543
Thank you, Dennis.

495
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,078
But we can't give you
your job back.

496
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:06,614
You sound just like her.

497
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:08,249
- That was unpleasant.
- Yeah.

498
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:10,852
All right, who's next?

499
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,953
You came.

500
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:14,455
Yeah, I had some encouragement.

501
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,692
Your sweater's on inside out.

502
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,028
And backwards.

503
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,596
It's been a tough morning...

504
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:24,365
lots of regret and shame.

505
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,635
That should be the official
slogan for Snakejuice.

506
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:30,371
Well, uh,
this committee would like to ask

507
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,106
if you are
the kind of candidate

508
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:33,675
who could forgive someone

509
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:35,843
after they've behaved
like a complete jackass?

510
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,246
This candidate could,

511
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:41,950
especially because
this candidate also behaved

512
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:43,384
like a total jackass.

513
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,053
Please, don't worry about it.

514
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,854
The committee
totally understands.

515
00:20:46,922 --> 00:20:50,058
Also, I can talk
about my qualifications

516
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,726
for this position.

517
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:55,396
But first, I am gonna go
throw up in a wastebasket.

518
00:20:55,464 --> 00:20:57,131
Would you mind if I joined you?

519
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:58,466
Not at all.

520
00:20:58,534 --> 00:21:01,903
Shall we?

521
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:03,137
Ann came in the next day

522
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:04,973
and had a second interview
with Chris.

523
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,808
She nailed it, of course.

524
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,977
But she doesn't want
to totally leave her job.

525
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:11,212
So they struck up a deal.

526
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,680
She works at City Hall
part-time,

527
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,983
and two days a week,
she still gets to be

528
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,384
the greatest nurse
in the world.

529
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:17,785
Win-win.

530
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:21,222
We need to remember
what's important in life...

531
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,292
friends, waffles, and work.

532
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,227
Or waffles, friends, work...
it doesn't matter.

533
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:27,729
But work is third.

534
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:29,817
So listen, Crazy Ira,
check this out, okay?

535
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:32,285
I'm at this club last night
just killing it...

536
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:33,586
the Snakehole Lounge.

537
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:35,855
Oh, yeah, is that a gay club?

538
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:37,824
Hello?

539
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:40,093
Shut up, ass.
Come on, man.

540
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,231
So I'm dancing on the floor
with this super-hot chick.

541
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,733
♪ Me so horny ♪

542
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,701
More like a dude, I bet.

543
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:50,637
Hello?

544
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:52,438
Did you wet your whistle?

545
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:53,773
I wish.

546
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,041
Me likey.

547
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,376
No, no, no, no.

548
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:57,977
She spent the whole night
talking to her friend,

549
00:21:58,045 --> 00:22:00,513
- arguing about their feelings.
- That's me!

550
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:02,581
Who knows?
She's probably a lesbian.

551
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:05,581
They were in the bathrom
a long time.

552
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:15,581
