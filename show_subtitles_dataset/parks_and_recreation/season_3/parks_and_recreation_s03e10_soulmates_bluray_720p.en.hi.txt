1
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:04,639
Pawnee is, as you all know,

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:06,499
the fourth most obese city
in America.

3
00:00:06,534 --> 00:00:07,968
Soon to be number three.

4
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,903
We're coming for you, San Antonio.

5
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:11,571
No, we are not.

6
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:13,306
We are slimming down...

7
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:15,208
Starting right here at City Hall.

8
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:16,343
I am implementing

9
00:00:16,377 --> 00:00:18,645
a government-wide health initiative.

10
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,814
We could have
a City Hall dodgeball league.

11
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:22,382
I have first pick, and my pick is Ron.

12
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,417
Great idea. Keep 'em coming.

13
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:25,952
Now, if anybody would like to join me,

14
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:27,621
I will be running backwards
up the big hill

15
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:28,655
behind the Wal-Mart.

16
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:31,458
Don't freak out,

17
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:34,661
but Joe from sewage just
unhooked your bra with his eyes.

18
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:37,797
What? Oh, boy.

19
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:39,766
Hi, Joe. What's up, Knope?

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,268
Looking good these days.

21
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:44,304
What do you say? Van's out back.

22
00:00:44,338 --> 00:00:45,605
Let's roll.

23
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,240
- Where's this coming from?
- I don't know.

24
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:48,775
You're putting out some vibe today.

25
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,110
It's just driving me crazy.

26
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:52,279
Listen, if you're looking
for a good time,

27
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:55,615
why don't you come on down
to the toilet party?

28
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,050
That's what we call
the sewage department.

29
00:00:57,084 --> 00:01:00,020
Great. Okay.

30
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:01,388
Liking the view.

31
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,858
- Still got it, Joe.
- No, you don't.

32
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:14,495
Corrected by www.addic7ed.com

33
00:01:25,946 --> 00:01:28,148
Christopher, got a second?

34
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:29,482
Oh, hey, Ron.

35
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:31,518
Listen, I've eaten
a commissary hamburger

36
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:33,320
for lunch every day for 12 years.

37
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:34,854
I just wanted to make sure

38
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,389
this pointless health crusade

39
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:39,426
won't affect the only part
of my job that I like.

40
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,061
Oh, no, those hamburgers are gone.

41
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:42,562
Red meat can cause sluggishness,

42
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,097
heart disease, even impotence.

43
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:46,700
Has the opposite effect on me.

44
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:48,335
You ever tried a turkey burger?

45
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,271
Is that a fried turkey leg
inside a grilled hamburger?

46
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:53,006
If so, yes. Delicious.

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,975
A turkey burger—you take
lean ground turkey meat,

48
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,044
and you make that into a
burger, instead of red meat.

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,713
Why would anyone do that
to themselves?

50
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:02,582
What if I told you that
I could make a turkey burger

51
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:06,186
that tastes better than any
other burger you've ever had?

52
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,688
Challenge accepted—

53
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:11,124
Cook-off later today in the courtyard.

54
00:02:11,158 --> 00:02:14,194
If I win, hamburgers remain
in the commissary.

55
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:16,029
What do I get if I win?

56
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,597
The rarest jewel of all—

57
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:20,233
Victory over me, Ron Swanson.

58
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,769
I like that. We're on.

59
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,371
You know, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

60
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:27,374
but I actually checked out that,
uh—that snow globe museum

61
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,809
that you recommended,
and it was pretty awesome,

62
00:02:29,844 --> 00:02:30,944
I have to say.

63
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,545
I mean, I did get in trouble
for shaking one.

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,381
Yeah, I'm not allowed there anymore.

65
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,149
So I have some ideas
for the health initiative.

66
00:02:36,183 --> 00:02:38,885
Okay. How about I swing by later,

67
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,920
and we'll just, you know,
maybe go over everything?

68
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:43,490
Or we could go out after work—

69
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:46,760
You know, go to JJ's
or something, grab a bite.

70
00:02:46,794 --> 00:02:48,995
Um, I-I don't think I can.

71
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:50,497
But why don't we just talk
about it later

72
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:53,733
in this building?

73
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:55,268
Okay? All right.

74
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:57,971
But, uh, you're great,
and you have great ideas,

75
00:02:58,005 --> 00:02:59,906
and...

76
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,243
Um...

77
00:03:03,277 --> 00:03:04,444
Uh, bye.

78
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:09,516
Bye, babe.

79
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,651
Hey, I brought
this cholesterol-testing kit

80
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:13,420
for the health thing.
Okay, let's do it.

81
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:17,123
So I asked Ben out to dinner,
and he said no.

82
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:19,426
What? He seemed really into you.

83
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,760
What did he say exactly?

84
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:23,163
He was like, "huh? What?
Huh? Oh. Bye."

85
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:25,331
And then he walked into an
office that wasn't his.

86
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:26,766
Oh. You know what?

87
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,301
If he doesn't want to go out
with you, he's nuts.

88
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:30,770
You're awesome, and there's a
million other guys out there.

89
00:03:30,805 --> 00:03:33,840
I have been having so much fun
just dating a bunch of people.

90
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:35,975
I know. Who was that guy
you were talking to out there

91
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,844
and then also kissing? I was—

92
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:39,813
Crap on a crayfish.
That really stings.

93
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,114
I haven't pricked you yet.

94
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:42,782
Oh, sorry. I was just picturing it.

95
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,884
You know what?
Maybe you need to cast a wider net.

96
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,286
Have you thought
about Internet dating?

97
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,687
Really? I don't think that's for me.

98
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:49,789
Aah! You're a monster.

99
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,558
Still haven't done it yet.
You know what?

100
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:53,159
I'll help you set up a profile.
It'll be fun.

101
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:54,994
All right, yeah, let's do it.
Okay, good.

102
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:56,529
- I'm glad that's over.
- Oh, it's not.

103
00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:59,532
You, Ann!

104
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:02,602
Who the hell is "Forp"?

105
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:05,004
I don't know.
I couldn't really hear him.

106
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,840
It sounded like his name was Forp.

107
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:08,741
- You get his number?
- No.

108
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:11,644
Good girl.

109
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,146
Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate.

110
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,181
Hey, I'm just gonna pop over
to grain 'n simple

111
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:17,250
to get the very best
ingredients for my burger.

112
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:20,086
- Do you want to come?
- What is grain 'n simple?

113
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,888
It's a health-food store.

114
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:23,490
Pawnee doesn't have
a health-food store.

115
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:26,192
No, but Snerling does, and
it's only a 40-minute drive.

116
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:27,560
What are you doing, Andy?

117
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:29,729
I'm getting healthier snacks
for the shoeshine stand.

118
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:31,231
Chris is a food genius.

119
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:32,932
Did you know that the food
you eat becomes energy?

120
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:36,669
Yeah. Boom! That's spaghetti.

121
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:38,538
Nachos.

122
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:40,406
That's a cookie.

123
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,609
That's my husband.

124
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:44,878
- See you tomorrow?
- Okay.

125
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:46,613
Is that a different guy from earlier?

126
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,615
- What?
- Never mind.

127
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:50,149
You ready to rock this profile?

128
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:51,217
All right.

129
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,919
Yellow-haired female

130
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:56,189
likes waffles and news.

131
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:58,091
Sexy, well-read blonde

132
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,059
loves the sweeter things in life.

133
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:01,194
Much better.

134
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,496
- Hobbies?
- Organizing my agenda.

135
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:04,764
Wait, that doesn't sound fun.

136
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,567
Um, jamming on my planner.

137
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,868
Favorite place?

138
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:11,738
Upstairs there's this mural
of wildflowers,

139
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:13,439
and I like to sit on a bench
in front of it.

140
00:05:13,474 --> 00:05:14,807
Really?

141
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:16,175
It could be anywhere in the world—

142
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,478
Paris, Hawaii,
the Grand Canyon.

143
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:20,914
No, just the bench
in front of the mural.

144
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,181
What about, like,
an actual meadow

145
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,550
- where wildflowers are?
- Ew, Ann.

146
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,652
I'm scared of bees. Mural.

147
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:26,986
Okay, what do you think of dogs?

148
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,054
Love.

149
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,122
- Cats.
- Love.

150
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:30,723
- Fish.
- Love.

151
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,358
Turtles.

152
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:35,194
No opinion.

153
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,729
They're condescending.

154
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:39,432
Describe your ideal man.

155
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,468
He's dark and mysterious,

156
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:45,338
and he can sing,
and he plays the organ.

157
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:48,174
I think you just described
the Phantom of the Opera.

158
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,109
Mm.

159
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,780
Ah, Nirvana. Hey, guys.

160
00:05:53,814 --> 00:05:54,914
Hey, Chris.

161
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,316
Amber, Annie, Bill, Johnny.

162
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,620
No, I don't plan to buy anything here.

163
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:03,690
I buy my burger ingredients
at food and stuff,

164
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:06,192
a discount-food outlet
equidistant from my home

165
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:07,527
and my work.

166
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:11,364
I came here for the same
reason people go to the zoo.

167
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,000
Shh.

168
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:17,937
Look at that thing.

169
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:20,773
Nature is amazing.

170
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:23,109
Okay. Oh, my God.

171
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,645
A 98% match.

172
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,013
That's a soul-mate-level match.

173
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:28,948
I've never seen anything
this high before.

174
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,784
Awesome.

175
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,853
Okay. I know what you're thinking.

176
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:36,022
And you know what?
You have to forget about Ben.

177
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:37,890
He had his chance, and he blew it.

178
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:41,628
This computer could have found
the future Mr. Leslie Knope.

179
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,896
Yeah. Okay...

180
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:46,299
Entire universe of guys
I might date,

181
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,534
let's see what you got.

182
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:49,702
Ah!

183
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,665
This is Craig at hoosiermate.com.
How can I help you?

184
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,843
Craig, your service is crap.

185
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:58,845
- Can you be more specific?
- Yes.

186
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,313
Your soul-mate match
was totally wrong for me.

187
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:02,081
I mean, I like him as a friend
and everything,

188
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,216
but I'd never go out with him.

189
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,684
He's like a little sister to me.

190
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:06,052
We have a very sophisticated algorithm

191
00:07:06,086 --> 00:07:08,021
that's paired up thousands of couples.

192
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:09,489
I actually met my wife on the site.

193
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:10,823
Really? Well, that's not gonna last.

194
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:11,991
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

195
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:14,027
Your marriage is a sham.
Good-bye, Craig.

196
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:17,697
See you, sweetheart.

197
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,098
Wow, he seems nice.

198
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:21,100
Eh. He kind of lives in a barn.

199
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:22,235
- What's up?
- What's wrong with me?

200
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:24,937
Why do good guys hate me
and gross guys love me?

201
00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:26,172
Diagnose me.
You're a nurse.

202
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,007
There's nothing wrong with you.

203
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:31,010
You are an intelligent,
classy, attractive woman.

204
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:33,446
But for whatever reason,
right now

205
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,015
only douche-y guys are buying
what you're selling.

206
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,919
So I should go and ask them
what they think I'm selling.

207
00:07:39,953 --> 00:07:42,422
A douche-vestigation.

208
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:43,456
Nice.

209
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,224
Hi, Joe.

210
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:46,959
I know you're gonna take this
the wrong way,

211
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:48,361
but can I talk to you
for a second?

212
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:51,364
You can do anything to me
for any number of seconds.

213
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:52,932
- Hmm.
- Would you like to talk outside

214
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:55,034
- in my van?
- No. Here's fine.

215
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,138
I was flattered
by what you said earlier.

216
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:02,108
And I was just wondering, what
do you look for in a woman?

217
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:05,144
She can't be in a wheelchair,

218
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,913
no canes, no gray hair.

219
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:08,247
So basically
you're just attracted to me

220
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:09,549
because I'm not an elderly person.

221
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,817
Yeah.

222
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:13,052
And as I aforementioned,

223
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,121
you have a killer dumpster.

224
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:19,792
What does this do?

225
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:28,167
Would you like to sample
our vegan bacon?

226
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:29,669
100% meatless.

227
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:31,704
Yes, please.

228
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:37,844
Another, please.

229
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:41,848
Sure.

230
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,449
S-sir, is there a problem?

231
00:08:43,484 --> 00:08:46,652
I'm just making sure
no one ever has to eat this.

232
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,955
I-I don't think
I can give you anymore.

233
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:50,223
I want one.

234
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:56,796
Yeah, I'm calling to lodge a complaint

235
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,532
about the seaweed and almond
under-eye cream

236
00:08:59,566 --> 00:09:01,167
I purchased from you guys.

237
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,436
Oh, my problem is it smells terrible.

238
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,671
Yeah, I even mixed it
with another under-eye cream,

239
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,274
and it still smelled,
so I ruined two eye creams.

240
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:11,644
Yes, I will hold.

Dragon fruit.

248
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:28,127
What's this?

249
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:30,196
A kiwano or horned melon.

250
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,965
- What's this?
- A peach.

251
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,668
I knew that.

252
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:36,969
Wow.

253
00:09:37,004 --> 00:09:40,473
Fresh lettuce
is my all-time favorite food.

254
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:41,474
What's your favorite food?

255
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:42,842
Oh, I take skittles,

256
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:45,511
and I put it between
two starbursts.

257
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:47,713
- You know what I call it?
- Skittle sandwich.

258
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,415
That's pretty good.

259
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,351
No, I call it Andy's mouth surprise.

260
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:56,556
It's nice because the flavor
of the starbursts

261
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,657
really bring out

262
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:03,229
a similar flavor in the skittles.

- Hey, Tom.

265
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:09,368
Um... What's up?

266
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:12,438
Do you want to go to lunch?

267
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:14,707
Uh, no, I don't really feel
like going to JJ's.

268
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:15,775
We can go anywhere.

269
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:17,410
Your choice. I'm buying.

270
00:10:17,444 --> 00:10:19,846
Can I get apps and 'serts?

271
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,781
'Serts are what I call desserts.

272
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,282
Tray-trays are entrees.

273
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:26,686
I call sandwiches Sammies,
Sandoozles, or Adam Sandlers.

274
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,455
Air conditioners
are cool blasterz, with a "z."

275
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:31,023
I don't know where that came from.

276
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:32,959
I call cakes big old cookies.

277
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,127
I call noodles long-ass rice.

278
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,530
Fried chicken is fry-fry chicky-chick.

279
00:10:37,564 --> 00:10:39,599
Chicken parm
is chicky-chicky parm-parm.

280
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,968
Chicken cacciatore— Chicky catch.

281
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:44,770
I call eggs pre-birds or future birds.

282
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:46,806
Root beer is super water.

283
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,641
Tortillas are bean blankies.

284
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:50,910
And I call forks...

285
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,445
Food rakes.

286
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:55,815
Yeah, you can get
as many 'serts as you want.

287
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:58,050
Well, let's get in my go-go mobile.

288
00:10:58,085 --> 00:10:59,452
Car.

289
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:01,120
This'll be fun.

290
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:03,289
Let's say you rub a bottle
and a genie comes out

291
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:05,424
and gives you three wishes—
What would those wishes be?

292
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,260
- Come on, Leslie.
- This'll be a fun game.

293
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:08,394
Three wishes. Go.

294
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:10,930
Okay, first wish,
I have a huge house

295
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:12,298
with a ton of balconies.

296
00:11:12,332 --> 00:11:13,833
Yeah, okay.

297
00:11:13,867 --> 00:11:15,668
And I would just stand out
there observing my empire,

298
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:17,303
like a drug dealer
in a Michael Bay movie.

299
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:20,673
And I'll just spend my time
out there reading my iPad

300
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:23,075
and drinking espressos
in a terrycloth robe.

301
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,011
Wish number two.

302
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:29,315
Okay, I'm the CEO
of the Spike TV Network.

303
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:31,951
And my best friend / personal assistant

304
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,320
is Oscar winner Jamie Foxx.

305
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:37,056
And we create
a raunchy animated series

306
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:41,327
based on our friendship called
Tommy and the Foxx.

307
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:43,362
Okay, we don't have
to do this anymore.

308
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:44,463
No, no, I'm into it now.

309
00:11:44,498 --> 00:11:45,665
Wish number three—

310
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,233
They remake Point Break.

311
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:49,201
I play both roles—

312
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:51,170
Keanu and Swayze.

313
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:53,272
I think if you continue
cross-training the way you have,

314
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:55,608
you're gonna—

315
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:57,109
I don't see any ingredients.

316
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,578
- Have you bought ingredients?
- Nope.

317
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:02,048
- Do you need help shopping?
- No.

318
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,482
Are you hurt?
Can you move?

319
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:04,684
Never felt better.

320
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:07,119
Chris!

321
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:08,487
Can I get these?

322
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:09,789
I said one thing.

323
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:11,891
Eh. Honey?

324
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,392
Pinwheel.

325
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:16,996
Let's play a different game.

326
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,798
I'm gonna say stuff about me,

327
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:20,132
and you say,
on a scale from one to ten,

328
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,901
how interested in
that thing you are.

329
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:23,903
Ready? Okay.

330
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:26,372
I love sunshine and fresh
air and early-morning walks.

331
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:27,406
- One.
- I have read

332
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:28,741
five biographies
of Eleanor Roosevelt.

333
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,109
- One.
- I work

334
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:31,477
- at the parks and recreation...
- One.

335
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:32,845
- That's what you do.
- One.

336
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,380
I once kissed
a girl in college...

337
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:35,982
Eight.

338
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,616
Where I graduated
Summa Cum Laude in history.

339
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:38,818
One, zero, negative a billion.

340
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:41,087
Don't talk about it
anymore, please.

341
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:47,193
I love food and stuff.

342
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,663
It's where I buy all of my food...

343
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:53,833
And most of my stuff.

344
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,401
Hey, can I get these?

345
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:56,769
How much are they?

346
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:58,704
Two bucks apiece.

347
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:00,906
Good deal.

348
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,708
Anything else?

349
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:06,612
Nope. Just the crows and the beef.

350
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,948
So the only thing that's
important to you is hotness?

351
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:11,717
Wendy, Lucy. All you cared about
was the shape of their boobs?

352
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,185
No. I really liked them,

353
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,421
and they happened
to have nice breasts.

354
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:16,622
You're acting really weird.

355
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:18,024
W-what'd you even
buy me lunch for—

356
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:20,126
Just so you could yell at me
for what I like about women?

357
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,028
Okay.

358
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,362
Promise not to tell anyone?

359
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:25,231
- Sure.
- This is insane.

360
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:28,834
But you and I got matched up
on hoosiermate.com.

361
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:31,904
98% match.

362
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:36,375
Soul-mate-level match.

363
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,444
You want to date me.

364
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:39,578
This is a date.

365
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:41,213
This is not a date, okay?

366
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:43,215
Uh, you took me to a
fancy restaurant.

367
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,817
You paid for my meal.

368
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:46,419
And you're trying to get
to know me better.

369
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:47,820
I was just trying to figure out

370
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:50,156
why only sleazy guys
are into me right now.

371
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,458
Nice try. You love me.

Hey, Tom, I'm just printing
out these health tips.

379
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:16,782
- Can you grab them for me?
- One second.

380
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:19,285
I'm just looking
at some real-estate listings.

381
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:21,187
Oh, this is perfect for us—

382
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:24,623
Three bedroom,
and, oh, God, Les,

383
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,760
it has that dream closet
you've always wanted—

384
00:14:27,794 --> 00:14:30,162
- A walk-in closet.
- Oh, God.

385
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,031
Hey, hey, Boo.

386
00:14:32,065 --> 00:14:35,701
What's wrong? Where'd you go?

387
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:37,636
- Come back to me.
- Stop it.

388
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,005
Don't disappear on me.
I need you, Boo.

389
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,110
All right.
Uh, let's get into it.

390
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,113
What do you guys have
for health tips?

391
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,347
Ben, if it's okay with you,

392
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:50,516
Leslie and I are gonna lead
the meeting today

393
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,852
because of our deep
spiritual connection.

394
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:54,920
Oka— All right.

395
00:14:54,955 --> 00:14:56,722
Is everything okay?

396
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:57,890
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

397
00:14:57,924 --> 00:14:59,191
Everything is great, Ben.

398
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:02,328
Les and I just had
something magical happen today

399
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:03,829
at lunch.

400
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:06,398
There is some weird juju
in this room right now.

401
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,834
Office yoga.
We do stretches at our desk

402
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:10,503
or next to our desk
or in a chair—

403
00:15:10,537 --> 00:15:12,071
always good for you.

404
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,472
Um...

405
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:16,008
We give everyone pedometers,

406
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,243
and we have a contest—

407
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:20,212
Whoever takes the most steps
wins a prize.

408
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,414
You know, anything to get
their heart rate up.

409
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,017
You know what else
gets people's heart rate up?

410
00:15:25,051 --> 00:15:26,919
Doing it.

411
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:29,889
Talking about sex with my boss.

412
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,058
Can you excuse us for a second?

413
00:15:33,093 --> 00:15:34,093
Yeah.

414
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:35,461
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

415
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:36,896
Ow! Let me get out of the chair!

416
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,831
Hey! What is wrong with you?

417
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:40,533
Leslie, it's the workplace.

418
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,034
You're being a little bit
too feisty right now.

419
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,236
You are being a little bit
too much of an ass right now.

420
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,704
Okay? Knock it off.

421
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:48,107
I can't fight this feeling anymore.

422
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:49,708
You and I—

423
00:15:49,743 --> 00:15:52,878
We're dating.

424
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:57,283
You should be so lucky.

425
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:58,417
- Leslie.
- Huh?

426
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:01,654
Tom.

427
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:06,725
They should fix that.

428
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:09,725
It was all— just a joke.

429
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:11,564
I can assure you, there's
nothing romantic going on

430
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:13,332
- between me and Tom.
- I have a very strict policy—

431
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:14,800
No office relationships,

432
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,503
particularly between
a supervisor and an employee.

433
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:18,871
The taxpayers pay us,

434
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:20,439
so we can't have anything

435
00:16:20,473 --> 00:16:22,007
appearing even
remotely scandalous.

436
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,809
I'm just saying, if you can't
keep your mouth to yourself,

437
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:26,912
- I'm gonna have to suspend you.
- I understand.

438
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:29,582
Look. Cucumber flower.

439
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:31,750
Wow. That's so cute.

440
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:33,819
Wait, that's a garnish.
You're not supposed to eat that.

441
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:35,221
What?

442
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,889
So just type up
those ones we talked about,

443
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:38,490
and we'll get it
finalized tomorrow.

444
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:40,292
Yep.

445
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:41,627
- Hey, Tom.
- Yep.

446
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:43,729
Um...

447
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:46,632
What was all that stuff
with you and Leslie?

448
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,235
Girl likes Indian food.
What can I say?

449
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,636
Fine.

450
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,938
We got matched up
on an online dating site.

451
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:55,274
And I was messing with her.
She got pissed.

452
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,610
So she took me out
in the hallway and kissed me

453
00:16:57,644 --> 00:16:59,645
- out of revenge.
- Really?

454
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,814
And as much as it pains me
to admit this,

455
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,249
it was not disgusting.

456
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,517
Okay, well,
I don't need the details.

457
00:17:05,552 --> 00:17:07,453
I'm just saying,
she knows what to do.

458
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:10,089
- All right.
- Like, I was impressed.

459
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:12,157
- Yeah.
- It was stirring.

460
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:13,659
- Good-bye.
- It felt like—

461
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,094
- Can— Yep.
- All right.

462
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:17,796
- Just— All right.
- Anyway, like I was saying...

463
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:19,865
I humbly place before you

464
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:22,668
my east meets west patented
Traeger turkey burger—

465
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:24,169
An Asian fusion burger

466
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:26,572
made with Willow Farms
organic turkey,

467
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:28,274
a toasted tallegio-cheese crisp,

468
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:31,176
papaya chutney,
black truffle aioli,

469
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:33,612
and micro-greens
on a gluten-free brioche bun.

470
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:35,648
- Enjoy.
- Mmm.

471
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:38,083
This tastes as delicious
as Beyonce smells...

472
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:39,351
I'm guessing.

473
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:41,553
What is this in here— Saffron?

474
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:43,722
Wow, somebody's got a sharp palate.

475
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:45,824
I love the umami flavor.

476
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,893
Stop being so pretentious, Kyle.

477
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,795
- Sorry.
- Here's mine.

478
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:53,699
It's a hamburger
made out of meat on a bun

479
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,234
with nothing.

480
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:57,036
Add ketchup if you want.

481
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,805
I couldn't care less.

482
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,241
Ron, I'm so disappointed.

483
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,510
I thought that you and I were
gonna have a real challenge.

484
00:18:04,544 --> 00:18:06,178
Never mind. This is better.

485
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:08,080
- Way better.
- Mmm. Yep.

486
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:09,081
Mm-hmm.

487
00:18:09,115 --> 00:18:10,382
Kyle?

488
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,217
Sorry, Andy. Ron's is better.

489
00:18:12,252 --> 00:18:14,820
Damn it, Kyle.

490
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:17,189
Oh, my God, it's so much
better, it's crazy.

491
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:19,892
Turkey can never beat cow, Chris.

492
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:21,393
Sorry.

493
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:23,228
I don't understand.

494
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:25,731
I-I-I've tinkered
with this recipe for years.

495
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:28,467
Granted, it's been a long time
since I've had hamburger.

496
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:37,009
This is better.

497
00:18:37,043 --> 00:18:38,510
The commissary will
continue to serve

498
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:41,046
horrifying,
artery-clogging hamburgers.

499
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:48,454
Man, we spent, like, 50 hours
working on those burgers.

500
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:50,723
I know. Hard work never pays off.

501
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:53,192
Cooking is dumb.

502
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:55,594
I swear on this dead crow

503
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:57,930
that I will never cook for you.

504
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:01,700
I love you.

505
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,669
I just wanted to make sure that
there were no hard feelings

506
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:05,037
after I forced you
to break up with Tom.

507
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:07,906
Oh, we weren't— No.

508
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:09,241
No hard feelings.

509
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:10,843
'Cause it's just
a real bugaboo of mine.

510
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:12,311
And it applies to everyone.

511
00:19:12,345 --> 00:19:14,179
Just the other day, Ben told me

512
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:15,748
that he might want to
socialize with somebody

513
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:17,349
from the government,
and I said, "I'm sorry"...

514
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:19,385
- "Not possible."
- Really?

515
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:20,953
Did he say who?

516
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:23,389
No, and I didn't ask,
'cause it's irrelevant.

517
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,923
He oversees every department.

518
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,458
It simply can't happen.

519
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:28,794
This is literally the best
thing I've ever eaten.

520
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:31,096
Mmm. And it's so bad for me.

521
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,664
I'm gonna have to jog
while I digest this.

522
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:35,901
Excuse me.

523
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:37,269
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

524
00:19:37,303 --> 00:19:40,472
Well, uh, I think
I'm allergic to chutney.

525
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:42,307
Also, what's chutney?

526
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:44,009
- No clue.
- Yeah.

527
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:45,511
Hey, I never got to tell you
the rest of my ideas.

528
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:47,646
You want to go somewhere
and talk about 'em?

529
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,181
Yeah. Yeah,
I'd love to.

530
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:51,150
Um, let me get some actual food

531
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,352
and then— do you know

532
00:19:53,386 --> 00:19:56,155
that wildflower mural
up on the second floor?

533
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:58,624
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

534
00:19:58,658 --> 00:19:59,691
You want to meet there?

535
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:01,527
- Yeah.
- Okay.

536
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:03,028
Sounds good.

537
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:05,130
I don't know
if the online thing is for me.

538
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:08,200
I prefer to meet people in person.

539
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:10,169
It's like door number two

540
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:12,971
on Let's Make a Deal.

541
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:14,540
Do you want the thing that you have,

542
00:20:14,574 --> 00:20:15,974
that you know you like

543
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:18,610
but isn't perfect,

544
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:23,482
or do you give it up for
what's behind door number two?

545
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:26,885
I think I like what I have.

546
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,555
I'm gonna try to make it work
with Tom.

547
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,156
I'm kidding.

548
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:35,794
How did you and I get matched up?

549
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:37,262
I made 26 profiles,

550
00:20:37,297 --> 00:20:39,431
each designed to attract
a different type of girl.

551
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:42,367
Tom A. Haverford,
sporty and sexy.

552
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:44,870
Tom B. Haverford,
smooth and soulful.

553
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:46,505
Which letter did you get?

554
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:48,440
"N." Tom N. Haverford.

555
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:51,310
The "N" stands for "Nerd."

556
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:52,411
I never even check that one,

557
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:53,612
'cause no one ever responds to it.

558
00:20:53,646 --> 00:20:54,847
Okay, well, whatever.

559
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:57,115
Tom N. Haverford collects globes.

560
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,350
Great. That's enough.

561
00:20:58,384 --> 00:21:00,285
His favorite movie is books.

562
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,353
Donna.

563
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:09,228
Every time I want you
to shut up from now on.
