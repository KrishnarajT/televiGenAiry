1
00:00:02,823 --> 00:00:05,190
Okay, Jerry, what have you chosen

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:06,258
to put in the time capsule?

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,325
These are my mother's diaries.

4
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:09,527
Wow.

5
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:10,995
Yeah, she lived in Pawnee
all of her life

6
00:00:11,062 --> 00:00:12,930
and recorded everything
she ever did.

7
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:14,064
Yeah, so it's, you know,
kind of like

8
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,699
a living document about the town.

9
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:16,901
Hmm.

10
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:19,069
A disappointingly
good idea from Jerry.

11
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:20,504
Better than good, Jerry.
Perfect.

12
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:22,106
Give me that.

13
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:24,775
"January 18, 1964.

14
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:27,878
"Jerrold starred in his school
production of Peter Pan.

15
00:00:27,946 --> 00:00:29,880
He was a beautiful
Tinker Bell."

16
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,150
It was an all-boys school.

17
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:40,157
Jerry!

18
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:41,258
Hey, Leslie, I have an idea.

19
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:43,127
Why don't we put Eduardo in there

20
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:46,797
and seal the top so
that he suffocates and dies?

21
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,033
Okay, Tom, you're up.

22
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,335
For my item, I chose a picture

23
00:00:51,403 --> 00:00:53,470
of my ex-girlfriend Lucy

24
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:55,372
with a mustache drawn on her face

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,775
and stink lines coming off her,
'cause she stinks.

26
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:00,344
She broke up with me.
Didn't really tell me why.

27
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:01,645
Luckily, when you're the guy,

28
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:03,213
you can just tell people
she's crazy.

29
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:05,583
"Hey, Tom, I heard you
and Lucy broke up."

30
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,252
"Yeah, man.
Turns out she's crazy."

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,588
That's what they always do
on Entourage.

32
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,022
Ron?

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,390
I am submitting this menu

34
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,993
from a Pawnee institution,
JJ's diner,

35
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,295
home of the world's best
breakfast dish,

36
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,965
the four horse meals
of the egg-pork-alypse.

37
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:22,566
Wendy loves it too.

38
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:25,269
And I am submitting this.

39
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,372
A brief history of everything
that has ever happened

40
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,640
since Pawnee was founded.

41
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,609
Not like you get
extra credit for this,

42
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,077
but I did type it from memory.

43
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:34,812
And for the first
time ever compiled,

44
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,281
it includes a complete list

45
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,650
of every official town slogan
we've ever had.

46
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:40,985
- Oh, my God, Leslie.
- I know. Can you believe it?

47
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:42,620
- That's crazy.
- Isn't it?

48
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,089
"Pawnee:
The Paris of America.

49
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:47,992
"Pawnee: The Akron
of Southwest Indiana.

50
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:50,694
Pawnee:
Welcome, German soldiers."

51
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:53,864
After the Nazis took France,
our mayor kind of panicked.

52
00:01:53,932 --> 00:01:56,200
"Pawnee: The factory fire
capital of America.

53
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,869
"Pawnee: Welcome,
Vietnamese soldiers.

54
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:01,038
Pawnee: Engage with Zorp."

55
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:02,706
For a brief time in the '70s,

56
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,575
our town
was taken over by a cult.

57
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:07,177
"Pawnee: Zorp is dead.
Long live Zorp.

58
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,279
"Pawnee: It's safe
to be here now.

59
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:11,949
Pawnee: Birthplace
of Julia Roberts."

60
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:14,251
That was a lie, she sued,
and so we had to change it.

61
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,353
"Pawnee:
Home of the world-famous

62
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:17,921
"Julia Roberts lawsuit.

63
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:20,624
Pawnee:
Welcome, Taliban soldiers."

64
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:22,526
And finally, our current slogan:

65
00:02:22,594 --> 00:02:26,096
"Pawnee: First in friendship,
fourth in obesity."

67
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:49,287
Yes, Pawnee has had
its set of problems,

68
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:52,382
but this time capsule
is our way of saying

69
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:55,485
that Pawnee is gonna be around
for a long time...

70
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:56,653
Capsule.

71
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:58,682
And you can quote me on that.

72
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:00,350
Oh, I'm actually gonna
quote you on all of this,

73
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:01,718
'cause it's a newspaper article.

74
00:03:01,786 --> 00:03:02,919
- I thought of a great headline.
- Great.

75
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:05,622
It's time to encapsulate
the future.

76
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,123
- Good one.
- Sub headline:

77
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:08,692
The parks department
cuts the crapsule,

78
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,126
buries the time capsule.

79
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:11,528
I'll be back tomorrow
with the photographer.

80
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:13,063
Okay.

81
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,931
Leslie, this guy's here.

82
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:16,666
Hi.
Can I help you?

83
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,068
I'm Kelly Larson.

84
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,636
I read online
about your time capsule,

85
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,171
and I'm here to make
a suggestion.

86
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,739
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're not taking sugges...

87
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,140
The Twilight books.

88
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,009
It's a beautifully-told saga
of vampires,

89
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:27,510
werewolves, and romance.

90
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:29,346
Ah, you are the person
that's been emailing me

91
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:30,981
about Twilight.

92
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:33,116
I thought you would be younger...

93
00:03:33,184 --> 00:03:34,451
And a girl.

94
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:36,286
Well, I'm not.
I'm older and a boy.

95
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:38,722
But I feel very strongly
that these should be included.

96
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:40,824
Can I tell you why?

97
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:41,891
Sure, Kelly.
Have a seat.

98
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,460
- Awesome.
- And plead your case.

99
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:46,396
Thanks.
Okay, Christmas Eve, 1973.

100
00:03:46,464 --> 00:03:48,365
Author Stephenie Meyer,
nee Morgan,

101
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:49,833
was born in Hartford,
Connecticut.

102
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,936
Oh, you're going all
the way back to her birth. Okay.

103
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:55,205
So basically, Ann kissed me

104
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,874
and then April kissed me,
and I told April,

105
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,210
because of honesty is important.

106
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:01,845
That's so true.

107
00:04:01,912 --> 00:04:03,346
But now she's gone
and gotten herself

108
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,248
a Venezuelan boyfriend
who's, like,

109
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:07,150
the handsomest dude
I've ever seen.

110
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:08,818
Present company excluded.

111
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:10,387
Oh, thank you.

112
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:12,322
Uh, I was talking about me.

113
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,024
Hey.

114
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:15,225
Ann Perkins!

115
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:17,027
Andy just gave me
a phenomenal shoeshine

116
00:04:17,094 --> 00:04:19,629
and I did not know that
you two once lived together.

117
00:04:19,697 --> 00:04:21,498
Yes.
Yes, we did.

118
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:24,401
Thank you for catching him up
on our history.

119
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,269
Andy, that was
an amazing shoeshine.

120
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:30,573
I can literally see my face
in my shoes.

121
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:31,941
See you later!

122
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,243
He didn't...
he didn't pay me.

123
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,611
Why are you hanging out
with Chris?

124
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,845
He just sat down.

125
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:37,247
What am I supposed to do?
He's my boss.

126
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:39,115
- No, he's not.
- He isn't?

127
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:40,884
God dang it.

128
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:43,186
I cannot figure out
who my boss is.

129
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:44,554
Andy, I like this guy.

130
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:47,524
Please don't do anything weird,
I beg you.

131
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,360
I just started dating Chris,
and I don't know how,

132
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,162
but Andy's gonna screw it up.

133
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,897
Andy screws everything up.

134
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:55,832
When we were dating,
I bought him a fish

135
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,434
and I don't want to get into it,

136
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:01,204
but somehow that fish ended up
dead in a cowboy boot.

137
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:02,739
And combined,
they have sold more than

138
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:05,108
100 million copies worldwide.

139
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:07,277
Now, have you seen any
of the Twilight movies?

140
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:08,645
No, I have not.

141
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:10,680
Well, let me describe them
to you shot-for-shot.

142
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:12,816
Movie number one.
Twilight.

143
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:15,118
We slowly pan up over a mossy log

144
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:17,220
to see a deer drinking
crystal-clear water.

145
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:19,522
Okay, Kelly, this time capsule

146
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,659
isn't just a barrel full
of stuff that people like.

147
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:25,829
It's about life in Pawnee
at this moment in time,

148
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,864
and there is nothing
in Twilight

149
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:29,632
that is specific to Pawnee.

150
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,000
I disagree, okay?

151
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:33,403
The town of Forks, Washington
is exactly like Pawnee,

152
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:36,740
except for the climate
and the vampires.

153
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,308
I'm sorry.
I have to say no.

154
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:39,976
I beg you to reconsider.

155
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:41,311
And I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

156
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,314
Then I'm gonna have to do this.

157
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,254
He brought handcuffs with him.

158
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:52,756
This whole thing was planned.

159
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:54,357
I think it's kind of cool.

160
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:55,725
It's not cool.

161
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,627
It's trespassing,
and that is breaking the rules.

162
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,629
Cool people make the rules.
They don't break the rules.

163
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,064
And if those kids want you
to break the rules,

164
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:02,265
then they aren't
really your friends.

165
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,100
Whoa, who are you even
talking about?

166
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:05,368
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm just annoyed.

167
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:07,036
But while we're on the subject,

168
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:09,305
your friend Orrin with the long
black nails and the cloak?

169
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:10,306
He concerns me.

170
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:11,741
He's a genius.

171
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:14,010
I'll care of this trespasser.

172
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:16,012
Give me 30 seconds.

173
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,247
I'm just gonna call security.

174
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:19,783
Guys, can we push
the meeting an hour?

175
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,251
What's going on?

176
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:23,386
Some guy handcuffed himself
to a pipe in my office

177
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:24,988
because we wouldn't put
a copy of Twilight

178
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,122
in the time capsule.

179
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,358
Damn it. Again?

180
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:31,795
You look sad.

181
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:32,962
You look like a weird goon

182
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,564
who's obsessed with a kid's book.

183
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:35,765
It's a girl, isn't it?

184
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,467
I can tell.

185
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:39,035
It's the look that Mike
had on his face

186
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,904
when Bella turned him down
for the dance.

187
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,505
Oh, yeah? Is it?

188
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:43,873
What look did your mom
have on her face

189
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:46,042
when she realized her son
was a complete failure?

190
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,011
Okay, I'll be quiet.

191
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:50,313
But I do know something
about heartbreak.

192
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,714
And you know who else does?

193
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:54,451
- Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds?
- No.

194
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:57,754
A little lady named Twilight
author Stephenie Meyer.

195
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,789
Trust me.

196
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:01,224
You should listen to him.

197
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:03,092
Those books are good.

198
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,562
Oh, I love any book
about vampires,

199
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,198
werewolves, monsters, zombies,

200
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:12,368
sorcerers, beasties,
or time-traveling romances.

201
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:14,804
And if I had an hour alone
with Robert Pattinson,

202
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:17,006
he would forget all about
Skinnylegs McGee.

203
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:18,041
I'll tell you that much.

204
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:19,709
Okay, buddy, time is up.

205
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:20,977
Give us the keys.

206
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:22,946
They're hidden somewhere
very far away.

207
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:24,314
Then we're gonna have
to cut you loose.

208
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,682
Why?
I'm not doing anything wrong.

209
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,584
Yes, you are.
You're trespassing.

210
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:30,119
Well, the fact remains
this is perfectly legal.

211
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:31,754
No, it's not.
You're trespassing.

212
00:07:31,822 --> 00:07:33,957
Look, I really don't want
to cause any trouble,

213
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,758
but I am not gonna leave
until you

214
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:37,126
put Twilight
in the time capsule.

215
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:38,962
This muscle-headed
storm trooper

216
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,129
doesn't scare me.

217
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:42,265
Go ahead, Artie.

218
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,766
No! No! No! No! No!

219
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:47,036
Please! No! No! No! No!
No! No! Get him away from me!

220
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:48,438
I am very scared of you!

221
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:49,772
All right!

222
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,307
Okay! All right! All right!
All right!

223
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,642
Stop.

224
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,776
If he wants to stay in there,

225
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:54,878
I'll let him stay in there.

226
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,679
In two hours,
he's gonna be so hungry

227
00:07:56,747 --> 00:08:01,518
and freaked out,
he's gonna be begging me to...

228
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,453
He brought a pillow.

229
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,888
Hey, Leslie, I'm making
some sleepytime tea.

230
00:08:04,955 --> 00:08:06,990
You want any?

231
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,931
Hey, dude, wake up, man.

232
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:14,119
Oh, morning, Tom.

233
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:16,488
Twilight is dope.

234
00:08:16,556 --> 00:08:18,590
- I told you.
- I couldn't put it down.

235
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:20,692
It was like she was peering
into my soul.

236
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,761
Sing it, friend.
Here.

237
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:25,630
Book two.
Twilight: New Moon.

238
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,032
Get cracking.

239
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:28,366
There's a second book?

240
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:30,669
And a third and a fourth.

241
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:33,672
No [bleep] way.

242
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:35,440
- It's fantastic.
- Yeah.

243
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,542
I worked really hard.
I did every pair that I could.

244
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,312
I didn't know
what to do with these.

245
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,447
- I think they're gloves.
- No, no, no, no.

246
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:43,682
Those are sports sandals.

247
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,150
They're for adventure racing.

248
00:08:45,218 --> 00:08:47,385
They perfectly contour
to the human foot,

249
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:50,388
and the human foot
is the ultimate technology.

250
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:52,090
Dude, that is
the coolest sentence

251
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,859
I've ever heard somebody talk.

252
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,528
So you love April,

253
00:08:56,596 --> 00:08:57,863
and she has a new boyfriend,
right?

254
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,031
You got all of that
from a picture?

255
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:02,133
No, you told me yesterday.
Andy...

256
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:06,004
I want to help you win her over.

257
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:07,305
Why do I want to help him?

258
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,007
Because he's a good person.

259
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:10,642
I love good people.

260
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,144
Hey, you know who should
wear these shoes?

261
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:15,146
Monkeys.

262
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,818
Well, this is an interesting
turn of events.

263
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:21,052
Is it?
I-I don't know.

264
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,420
I mean, I guess
it's kind of interesting.

265
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:23,488
What the real story is

266
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,657
is how wonderful
our time capsule is

267
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:28,226
and how it perfectly
encapsulates...

268
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,694
a word I really
think you should use...

269
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:31,730
what our town is all about.

270
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:33,265
Hey, how's this for a headline?

271
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,867
"Parks department
foiled by pipe dreams."

272
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:38,003
God, that's an amazing headline,

273
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,671
but please don't
write that story.

274
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:42,707
The key to April's heart
is within you, Andy.

275
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:44,576
You need to tap in to the aspects

276
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:47,412
of your personality
that she once found attractive

277
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,849
to make yourself the best
version of yourself.

278
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:51,950
What's great about you?

279
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:53,485
I'm nice.

280
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,053
Good! Nice.

281
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:56,588
What else?

282
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:57,722
I'm in a band.

283
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,991
Band!

284
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:03,828
- What else?
- That's it.

285
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,764
Am I Team Edward?
Yes.

286
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:09,100
Do I share his concerns
about turning Bella, though?

287
00:10:09,168 --> 00:10:10,502
Absolutely not.

288
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,071
Edward's primary goal
at all times

289
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,506
is Bella's protection.

290
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,676
Can you please,
please be quiet?

291
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:18,977
Sorry. Sorry.

292
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:21,313
Please keep it down.
Be considerate.

293
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,681
Look at it this way, Tom.

294
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,683
Bella's love for Edward
is being tested.

295
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,284
By Jacob?

296
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:27,585
Mm. Not exactly.

297
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:28,753
- The volturi?
- Yes.

298
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:29,955
Okay, you know what?
All right.

299
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:31,222
I'm gonna go do my work
in the conference room,

300
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,291
'cause you guys are the worst.

301
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,260
You seem tense, Leslie.
You know what you should do?

302
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:36,528
Read Twilight?

303
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,529
Read Twilight.
Here.

304
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,998
Yeah, thanks.

305
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:42,000
Sometimes I think
she's in the volturi.

306
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:47,806
Good morning, Kelly.

307
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:49,474
Oh, morning, Leslie.

308
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,409
Hope you don't mind I moved
myself over to this pipe.

309
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:52,477
It's a little more comfortable.

310
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:53,645
No problem.

311
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:54,713
Did you have a nice night?
Sleep well?

312
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,281
Mm, it was all right,
considering.

313
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:57,382
Picked you up some coffee.

314
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,650
Thank you so much.

315
00:10:58,718 --> 00:11:00,085
Well, you seem pretty chipper
this morning.

316
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:01,252
I am, Kelly,

317
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,723
because I know why you're here.

318
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,458
You know what I did last night?

319
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,226
Read Twilight,
and it transformed your life

320
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,828
and you're gonna put it
in the time capsule?

321
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:11,429
Well, I read the first ten pages.

322
00:11:11,497 --> 00:11:12,964
I couldn't really
get into it, though.

323
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:15,066
More of a Harry Potter
girl myself.

324
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:16,334
What?

325
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:17,802
But I looked at the inside cover,

326
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,538
and I saw this.

327
00:11:20,606 --> 00:11:22,707
Did a little research,
and Liz Waverly

328
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,576
is 12 years old,
a straight "A" student

329
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,744
at King Philip Middle.

330
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,946
She's also a member of many

331
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:29,647
Twilight Internet
message boards

332
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:32,283
and I'm guessing your daughter?

333
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:34,786
Is that why you did this?

334
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,488
To impress your daughter?

335
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:40,091
Liz's mom and I divorced
a couple years ago,

336
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,593
and it's been really hard on her.

337
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,129
And she loves Twilight
and so...

338
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:45,964
I read about your time capsule
and I thought

339
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:47,432
that if I could somehow
convince you

340
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,001
to get it in there,
I'd be a big hero.

341
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,003
That's really sweet.

342
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:54,973
You should have told me you were
doing this for your daughter.

343
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,841
I didn't want
to drag her into it.

344
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,610
I'm sorry.
This is a mistake.

345
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,845
You don't have to put Twilight
in the time capsule.

346
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,883
I think we should put Twilight
in the time capsule.

347
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,384
Leslie, no.

348
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:08,253
We don't negotiate with weirdos.

349
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,388
Yeah, what happened to,
"a perfect encapsulation

350
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:11,823
of life in Pawnee"?

351
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,858
Well, for that guy,
life in Pawnee

352
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:15,994
is him and his daughter
reading that book.

353
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:17,929
Besides, I can get Shauna
on board.

354
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,798
It would make a great
human interest story.

355
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,366
Uh, if this gets out,

356
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:23,101
every time you want
to do anything,

357
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,736
some guy's gonna come
into your office

358
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,404
and handcuff himself to a pipe.

359
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:29,841
Well, yeah, that's a good point.

360
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:33,078
Then we shall
bring the pipe to them.

361
00:12:33,145 --> 00:12:34,145
Oh, no.

362
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,714
Oh, yes.

363
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:38,216
What does that mean?

364
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:40,251
Crackpot convention.

365
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,887
So that's what
today's forum is for.

366
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:44,489
We're gonna hear suggestions
from everyone,

367
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:47,225
and then whichever items
we generally agree on

368
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:50,095
will go into the time capsule.

369
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:52,097
Please remember this is
a government project,

370
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:54,999
so we need to refrain
from corporate promotion

371
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,234
and religious items.

372
00:12:56,302 --> 00:12:57,402
Who'd like to start?

373
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,904
I think we should
put in the Bible.

374
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:01,673
Great.

375
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:06,678
Eduardo.

376
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,012
Hi, Eduardo.

377
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,348
I want to apologize.

378
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,050
Just because
you're dating my soul mate

379
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:14,552
doesn't give me any right
to be a jerk to you.

380
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,887
Um, I promise from now on,

381
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:18,389
I'm just gonna be...
Super nice to you.

382
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:19,691
Thank you for saying that.

383
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,959
You're welcome.

384
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:22,560
Um, what, uh, CDs are those?

385
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:24,095
Mouse Rat.
My band.

386
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:25,997
It's our latest album.
Yeah.

387
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:27,966
You, uh, like music?
What are you listening to?

388
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,602
The Smiths.
Ugh. Very depressing.

389
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:31,903
April's making you listen
to that?

390
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:33,438
She's really
into that indie stuff.

391
00:13:33,506 --> 00:13:36,040
I'm more of
a Dave Matthews guy myself.

392
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,976
David Matthews!
Crash into me!

393
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:40,545
Yes!
I love that song.

394
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:42,614
Here you go, here.
Take one. Check us out.

395
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:45,150
We're amazing, so let me know
how much you like us.

396
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:46,417
Yeah, gracias.

397
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:48,386
That means "thank you"?

398
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,488
- Yes.
- Nailed it.

399
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:53,825
So we have one very moving
case for Twilight.

400
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:56,161
Anyone else?
Great.

401
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:57,996
- Two people for Twilight.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

402
00:13:58,063 --> 00:14:00,431
I'm Marcia Langman
from the Society

403
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,133
for family stability foundation.

404
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,502
This book contains
pagan creatures

405
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,771
and strong sexual overtones.

406
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,374
There are girls quivering.

407
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,910
There are boys staring deeply
into girls' eyes

408
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,845
as they quiver and so forth.

409
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,647
There really is a tremendous
amount of quivering.

410
00:14:15,714 --> 00:14:17,348
It is anti-Christian,

411
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,384
it is pro-quivering,
and the government

412
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:21,286
has no business promoting it.

413
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:24,789
I totally disagree.

414
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:26,324
Well, now we have two people
for Twilight.

415
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:27,959
Absolutely not.

416
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:30,061
I'm with the National
Civil Liberties Association.

417
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:33,932
That book actually contains
overt Christian themes,

418
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,434
and as such, has no business
being associated

419
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,102
with any government project.

420
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,840
So too Christian
and not Christian enough?

421
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,175
Do you see the irony here?

422
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:45,810
No? Okay.

423
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:49,247
Uh, Donna, why don't you
put a question mark

424
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:50,381
next Twilight?

425
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:52,417
No!
You promised!

426
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:54,252
You promised?
That's not fair!

427
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,620
Wait, it's not a question
of fairness.

428
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:57,488
- It's secul...
- Go back to Russia, commie!

429
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:59,023
Hey, you go back to Russia!

430
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:00,458
And you go back to wherever
you came from!

431
00:15:00,526 --> 00:15:01,626
Why would I go to Russia?

432
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:03,061
I have no interest
in traveling to Russia.

433
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:04,295
Can I just say that?

434
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:07,040
Um, who else?

435
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,527
I would like to include
my favorite book:

436
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,796
Crazy from the Heat:
The David Lee Roth Story.

437
00:15:11,673 --> 00:15:13,173
Well, I think if we're
gonna be adding a book

438
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,108
to the time capsule,
it would probably be Twilight.

439
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:16,577
I don't care about Twilight.

440
00:15:16,644 --> 00:15:18,278
Why is this only about
his favorite book?

441
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:19,980
I want my favorite book in there.

442
00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:21,815
Okay, I have an idea.

443
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:24,051
Two time capsules.

444
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:27,187
One that totally encapsulates
what's happening

445
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,956
right now in Pawnee
in this moment in time

446
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,424
and the other one
that's just for items

447
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:33,060
of personal significance,
like Twilight.

448
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:34,895
No Twilight!

449
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:36,563
Yes, Twilight!

450
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:40,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

451
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:41,902
Thanks for coming.

452
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,371
I only have a second.
I have to get to work.

453
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,873
Bella's going on her first hunt.

454
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,611
I just don't get
why you broke up with me.

455
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:52,012
Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough

456
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,247
like the normal kids compared
to the vampires?

457
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:57,250
Is it an Edward-Bella-Jacob
type situation

458
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:00,253
where you like me but there's
someone else you like more?

459
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:04,591
Uh, it's nothing
to do with Twilight.

460
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:07,828
It just didn't work out.
Okay?

461
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,329
Well, what difference
does it make?

462
00:16:09,397 --> 00:16:11,164
If we stayed together,
you probably would have

463
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:12,165
just dumped me for Ron.

464
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,801
Actually, that's the reason.

465
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:17,070
I believe you when you say
that you're not in love

466
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,373
with Wendy anymore,
but you're definitely not cool

467
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,507
with her dating Ron.

468
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:21,842
You talk about it constantly.

469
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,810
Well, I can't help it, okay?

470
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:26,279
I mean, he's so manly,
and he's my boss.

471
00:16:26,347 --> 00:16:28,882
Imagine if your boss
was Angelina Jolie,

472
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,617
and then one day,
she just started

473
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:31,885
dating your ex-boyfriend.

474
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:33,220
Wouldn't that freak you out
a little bit?

475
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:35,856
Well, not if I had great
new boyfriend, dumbass.

476
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:37,858
Look, Tom, I like you.

477
00:16:37,925 --> 00:16:40,427
You're really cute
and you're funny

478
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:42,963
and you're small enough
for me to throw you around.

479
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:45,298
So if you ever work through this,

480
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,300
then give me a call.

481
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,575
My grandmother lived
in Pawnee for 60 years,

482
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:58,779
and I want to put her ashes
in the time capsule.

483
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:02,649
My cat, Turnip,
was the greatest cat ever,

484
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:05,385
and I'd like to put his ashes
in the time capsule.

485
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:08,488
For the last time,
and I won't say this again,

486
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:11,825
there will be no human
or feline ashes

487
00:17:11,893 --> 00:17:13,560
in either one of
the time capsules.

488
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:15,696
Except for Turnip.

489
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:17,731
Except for Turnip.

490
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,032
No chanting.

491
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,367
Look, we don't know
what the world

492
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:21,968
is going to be like in 50 years.

493
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:25,906
We could all have been wiped out
from disease or the flu.

494
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:27,874
So what's your suggestion?

495
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:29,943
I don't know.

496
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:31,611
I'm just scared.

497
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,046
Hey.

498
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:49,463
Andy!

499
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,565
I got two microphones,
a four-track recorder,

500
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:54,101
and every bass tab
to Dave Matthews ever.

501
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:55,302
- Vamos!
- We're gonna jam

502
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:56,770
for, like, nine hours.
Is that cool?

503
00:17:56,838 --> 00:17:57,838
- Yeah.
- All right.

504
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:00,006
That's ridiculous.

505
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:01,842
Now, why should
the bill of rights

506
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:04,511
be in the official time capsule

507
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:06,847
but this painting of my dog

508
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:09,416
is in time capsule seven?

509
00:18:09,484 --> 00:18:12,452
Well, I think pet paintings/ashes

510
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,321
are in time capsule four.

511
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:17,124
No, that's baseball cards.

512
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:18,892
No, baseball cards

513
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,628
are in time capsule nine:
Childhood memorabilia.

514
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:22,863
Honestly,
Twilight could go

515
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,464
in almost any of these
categories.

516
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,233
Oh, shut up, Kelly!

517
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,701
Make me, Bob!

518
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:30,203
Okay, let's take
a ten-minute break!

519
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,905
Oh, God.

520
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:34,975
This time capsule's
tearing this town apart.

521
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:36,109
You're leaving soon.

522
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:37,611
Can I blame it on you
in the press?

523
00:18:37,678 --> 00:18:40,313
Sure.

524
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:42,182
Well, I got to say,
I think it's kind of impressive.

525
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,483
I've been to a lot of towns.

526
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:45,218
Usually people don't care
about anything.

527
00:18:45,286 --> 00:18:46,753
I mean, don't get me wrong.

528
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:48,555
These people are weirdos,

529
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:52,392
but they're weirdos who care.

530
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:56,129
Excuse me, everyone.

531
00:18:56,197 --> 00:18:59,232
I realize things have gotten
a little out of control,

532
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,234
and that's Ben's fault,
and he's sorry.

533
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:03,069
But I have an idea,
and if you like it,

534
00:19:03,137 --> 00:19:06,006
I think we can end this
right now.

535
00:19:06,073 --> 00:19:07,808
"Dear Pawnee of the future,

536
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,643
"congratulations.

537
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,545
"You have found a time capsule

538
00:19:11,612 --> 00:19:13,580
"that was buried
over 50 years ago.

539
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:16,483
"We wanted to include
a collection of items

540
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:17,717
"that would best represent

541
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:20,387
"what life was like in our town
at that moment.

542
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:23,190
"Instead, you'll find
only one item...

543
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:26,893
"a video recording
of a public forum we held

544
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:30,130
"in order to determine
just what those items would be.

545
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:32,299
"This is truly
what life was like...

546
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:35,235
"a lot of people
with a lot of opinions

547
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:37,304
"arguing passionately
for what they believed in.

548
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:40,407
"So enjoy watching it.

549
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:43,143
"A-assuming you still have
electricity.

550
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:46,213
"And sorry about the weird
blank gap in the middle.

551
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,714
"A man named Jerry Gergich

552
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:50,250
"screwed up
the recording somehow.

553
00:19:50,318 --> 00:19:52,452
"He had one job to do.

554
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,956
Sincerely,
Pawnee of the past."

556
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:09,231
Is Eduardo coming?

557
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,886
No, he went back to Venezuela.

558
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,675
Oh, that sucks.

559
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:15,597
He was a really good bassist.

560
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,865
- I was actually started to like him.
- I know.

561
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:20,270
That's what made me start to hate him.

562
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,742
The nice and band totally worked.

563
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,295
Have you enjoyed your time with Andy?

564
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,379
Yeah, he's great.

565
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,675
And he told me how great you are...

566
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:42,545
And he told me that I would be crazy
to let you away.

567
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,953
- He did, huh?
- He did.

568
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:48,819
And also, there's a pretzel stand
over there that literally serves

569
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,044
the best pretzel I've ever had.
Would you like one?

570
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:52,245
Absolutely.

571
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:54,942
Hey guys.

572
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:59,146
Listen, I've never seen this before, so...

573
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,829
I'd really appreciated if no one
like talked or texted or anything.

574
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:03,970
Oh...

575
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:10,170
Hey.

576
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,522
- Hey, Leslie, thanks for setting this up.
- Dude, what did I just say?

577
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,579
- I was the guy who introduced you to...
- How about you shut up?
