1
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:02,592
- Hey, Leslie
- Hey

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:03,182
Thank you for that

3
00:00:03,183 --> 00:00:05,182
"You're over your maintenance"
cost analysis.

4
00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:06,982
- That was really helpful
- You're so welcome.

5
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:08,192
I think you may wanna
read it.

6
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:11,092
´Cause I was uhm...

7
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:13,292
'Cause I told you that
I wanted to read it?

8
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:14,492
Yeah

9
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:15,892
That's a good reason.

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,829
Oh, anyway, Chris wants to
see us in his office.

11
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:19,896
I guess we should head
over there.

12
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:21,231
- All right.
- All right.

13
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:22,532
- All right, cool.
- Great.

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,001
- See you there.
- I'll see you there, Benjamin.

15
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:25,302
- Ben.
- All right, Leslie-min.

16
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:26,987
Leslie.

17
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:29,239
Hi, Ben.

18
00:00:29,307 --> 00:00:32,009
Oh, hey, Ann.

19
00:00:33,578 --> 00:00:36,713
Wow, that was
the most sexual tension

20
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:38,582
I have ever seen
in a conversation

21
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:39,833
about documents.

22
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:42,169
It can't happen.
We could both get fired.

23
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:44,254
- That's a dumb rule.
- I know!

24
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:45,806
Well, if you have to follow it,

25
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,174
I would just suggest

26
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:51,128
avoiding one-on-one,
tension-y situations with him.

27
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:53,330
You're right.
Good plan.

28
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:55,515
I am sending you two on a trip.

29
00:00:56,768 --> 00:00:58,035
Really?

30
00:00:58,102 --> 00:00:59,736
The Indiana little league
baseball tournament

31
00:00:59,804 --> 00:01:03,373
is upon us, and Pawnee
hasn't hosted it in 20 years.

32
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:05,575
So, I would like you two
to go to Indianapolis

33
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:06,993
and state our case,

34
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:10,113
because you two
are my dynamic duo.

35
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:14,785
Put it here.
Eh, eh-eh, eh...

36
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:15,786
- Go team!
- Yeah.

37
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:25,789
Sync & corrections by Alice
www.addic7ed.com

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,475
Ann, everything you have
is too sexy.

39
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:40,644
This is actually the dress
that Julia Roberts wore

40
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,045
as a prostitute
in Pretty Woman.

41
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:44,197
I know.
I look really good in it.

42
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:45,866
I need, like,
a sweat suit or something.

43
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,285
I need to send out a signal
that nothing is gonna happen.

44
00:01:48,352 --> 00:01:50,070
Oh, this is insane.

45
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:52,656
It's so obvious
you're dying to be together.

46
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:54,057
And now you're going
on a road trip?

47
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,493
I mean, you guys
could literally "get a room."

48
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,161
Yeah, and I could
literally get a-fired.

49
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:00,547
All right, I will help you
anti-seduce him.

50
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:02,415
Just tell me
what else you need.

51
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,235
I need to think of unsexy,
boring conversation topics

52
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:06,503
we can talk about in the car.

53
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:08,505
I have a few ideas.

54
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:10,090
We could discuss
the New Yorker article

55
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:11,892
"The history of the ladder."

56
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:13,059
Okay.

57
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:14,561
We could talk
about different dorms

58
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:16,012
at Johns Hopkins University,

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,849
and I could read
from my Sonicare booklet.

60
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,884
- Oh, I have a good idea!
- What?

61
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:23,553
Why don't you ask him
about his penis?

62
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,525
Pawnee Zoo, monkey speaking.

63
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:33,029
Okay, everyone stop
what you're doing

64
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,081
and come with me...
all four of you.

65
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,033
- Where are you going?
- Leslie's not here today.

66
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:38,418
No boss.
We can do whatever we want.

67
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,036
I'm your boss.

68
00:02:40,104 --> 00:02:42,439
That's a good one, Ron.

69
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,624
Let's go, seriously.
Come on.

70
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,209
Here's the sitch.

71
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:47,811
I developed
a dope new game show

72
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,013
where I ask couples
scandalous questions,

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,015
and they have to guess
what the other one answered.

74
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,518
I call this Know ya Boo.

75
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:56,353
Oh, that sounds like
The Newlywed Game.

76
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,687
Shut up, Jerry!

77
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,055
It's not The Newlywed Game okay?

78
00:02:59,123 --> 00:03:01,791
It is totally
The Newlywed Game.

79
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:03,760
But big deal.
Everyone steals.

80
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,278
My favorite movie
is Love don't cost a thing,

81
00:03:05,363 --> 00:03:06,496
with Nick Cannon,

82
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:08,265
which is based on
Can't buy me love,

83
00:03:08,332 --> 00:03:10,500
which is based on
Kramer vs. Kramer

84
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:11,935
or something,
which I think was Shakespeare.

85
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:13,954
Don't know, don't care.

86
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:15,472
And what exactly
do you plan on doing

87
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,573
with this game show idea?

88
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:19,176
Are you going to
shove it up your butt?

89
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:21,645
No, I'm gonna test it out
on you four bing-bongs

90
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:23,146
and work out the kinks,

91
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:25,382
then hire actual attractive
people, and make a demo.

92
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:27,717
What network is gonna buy
a game show from you?

93
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:29,686
There's a million networks
out there,

94
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:30,954
and they all need programming.

95
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:33,890
Spike, G4, GSN, Fuse,

96
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,458
WoW, Boom, Zip, Kablam,

97
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:38,061
Slurp, Slurp Latin, Slurp HD.

98
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:39,629
I love Slurp HD.

99
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,431
Have you guys seen
Ultimate Battle Smoothie?

100
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:43,266
- That's a dope show.
- Oh, my God.

101
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:46,052
Yeah, so, basically
every dorm allows bed lofting,

102
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,854
but the students
have really taken to it

103
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,022
at Wolman and McCoy.

104
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:50,824
Did you go to Johns Hopkins?

105
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:52,742
No.

106
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,879
Do you wanna play some music?

107
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:59,115
Sure! Ann and I burned
an awesome CD for the trip.

108
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:01,318
Jimmy Carter's
Crisis of Confidence speech,

109
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:03,353
Learning to speak Mandarin,

110
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:06,523
16 minutes of
Old timey car horn,

111
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:10,760
and something called
Banjo Boogie Bonanza.

112
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:16,516
It's an amazing instrument,
the banjo.

113
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:18,301
Yeah.

114
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:20,553
I didn't realize
it... it could be this loud.

115
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:25,942
Hello?

116
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,811
Hello?

117
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:29,746
Can I help you?

118
00:04:29,814 --> 00:04:31,281
Hi. My class is here
on a field trip,

119
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:34,618
and I'm supposed to interview
someone for a school project.

120
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:37,020
Okay. You can wait
at that table,

121
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:41,057
and someone
will be here sometime.

122
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,792
But aren't you here now?

123
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:47,080
No.

124
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,798
♪ Ba na na na na na
na na na na ♪

125
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:51,701
It's time to know ya...

126
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:55,371
I don't have the instrumental
backing track yet,

127
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,906
but it's gonna say
"boo" right there.

128
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:58,308
Hey, everybody!

129
00:04:58,376 --> 00:04:59,893
Welcome Know ya Boo.

130
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,428
I'm your host, TomHaverford,

131
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:04,948
and with me as always
is my CGI puppy co-host,

132
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,683
Bobby the boo!

133
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:08,435
Hey, everybody!

134
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,487
All right, let's get to it.

135
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:12,572
First question...

136
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,941
fellas, which rock star
would your lady bang

137
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:17,360
if she could bang
one rock star?

138
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,912
Jerry!

139
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:23,133
I believe I have heard Donna
talk about Prince a lot.

140
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,284
What'd your boo say?

141
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:27,370
Ah!

142
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,538
- Impressive!
- Hee hee!

143
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:30,340
All right, Andy,

144
00:05:30,408 --> 00:05:31,941
which rock star
would your lady get with?

145
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,178
Um, this is
almost too easy... me!

146
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,813
Let's check in with ya boo!

147
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:39,182
- Yay!
- Oh!

148
00:05:39,249 --> 00:05:41,384
Sorry.

149
00:05:41,435 --> 00:05:43,103
Who is Jeff Mangum?

150
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:44,854
The guy
from Neutral Milk Hotel.

151
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:47,023
Oh! Oh.

152
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:49,492
Neutral Milk Hotel.
What is that?

153
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,694
That's my favorite band.

154
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:52,195
I've told you that,
like, a thousand times.

155
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:54,798
I don't remember.
Why wouldn't you pick me?

156
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:57,300
I don't know. You're
not technically a rock star.

157
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:59,119
Booyah!

158
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:00,737
Somebody don't know their boo!

159
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:02,238
That's the sound bite
that's gonna play

160
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:03,473
when a fight breaks out.

161
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,959
Look, little girl,

162
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,244
can we postpone this
for another day?

163
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:10,580
It's unsettling
having you just sit there.

164
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:12,582
But my report's due tomorrow.

165
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,018
- What's it on?
- Why government matters.

166
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:17,053
Really?

167
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,888
It's never too early to learn

168
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:21,091
that the government
is a greedy piglet

169
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:23,259
that suckles
on a taxpayer's teat

170
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:26,396
until they have
sore, chapped nipples.

171
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,500
I'm gonna need
a different metaphor

172
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:32,669
to give this nine-year-old.

173
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:34,070
What's your name, ma'am?

174
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:35,355
Lauren Berkus.

175
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,525
Lauren, my name is Ron Swanson,

176
00:06:38,609 --> 00:06:41,344
and I'm gonna tell you
everything you need to know

177
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:43,079
about the miserable,
screwed-up world

178
00:06:43,147 --> 00:06:45,415
of local government.

179
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:47,083
You have mustard
in your moustache.

180
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:50,687
Don't sass me, Berkus.
Let's get started.

181
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:54,891
"Life, liberty, and property."
That's John Locke.

182
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:59,179
What is this?

183
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,797
Whale sounds.

184
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:02,132
Okay.

185
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,850
You can change it if you want.

186
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:05,435
Yeah?

187
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:09,022
What the hell?

188
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:10,807
Oh, no, no, no.
This is such a great song.

189
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,612
Yeah, I snuck
an Al Green song in there.

190
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,414
I want them to get together.

191
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,782
Sue me.

192
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:19,949
Did you see this?

193
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:21,317
According to their rules,

194
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:23,403
we may not have enough
hotel rooms within city limits.

195
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,121
I know.
It's a silly rule.

196
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:27,290
But maybe they'll be
reasonable and not care.

197
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:29,025
Yeah, maybe we could
just point out to them

198
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:31,377
there are tons of hotel rooms
just outside city limits.

199
00:07:31,462 --> 00:07:32,712
Uh-huh.

200
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:34,831
Have you been to
the Grandville Hotel and Spa?

201
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:37,967
- Uh-uh.
- They have the softest towels.

202
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:40,303
Oh, I gotta tell ya.
I love a nice towel in my life.

203
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,554
Me too.
I know.

204
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,239
It's... I mean,
it's the simplest luxury,

205
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:44,591
but it makes
all the difference.

206
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:46,009
Their bath mats are amazing.

207
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,644
It's like stepping on a lamb.

208
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:53,183
Oh, hold on.
Hey, come here.

209
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:56,402
You've got an eyelash
on your face.

210
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,822
I got it.
Make a wish.

211
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,074
Learning to speak Mandarin.
Unit three...

212
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:02,926
- Get away from me.
- Sorry.

213
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:04,561
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

214
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:05,895
- Um...
- Um...

215
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:07,630
I'm allergic to fingers.

216
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,899
Where are you going?

217
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:11,634
Maybe we should just
not talk to each other

218
00:08:11,702 --> 00:08:13,002
for the rest of the trip,

219
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,088
and I'm just gonna concentrate
on the presentation.

220
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:16,405
Okay.

221
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:19,242
This is my little brother.

222
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:23,342
Next up.

223
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,242
The delegation
from Pawnee, please?

224
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,791
And, so, as you can see,

225
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,960
Pawnee has 12 beautiful
baseball diamonds,

226
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:33,496
and our seats
have extra cushioning

227
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:35,798
due to the massive size
of our average citizen.

228
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,967
I have to bring up
what happened

229
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,236
the last time Pawnee
hosted this tournament.

230
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:41,504
No, you don't.

231
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:42,738
Good evening.

232
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:44,740
We begin with
our first story tonight.

233
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:46,442
They're cute, they're cuddly,

234
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,210
but now they're wreaking havoc

235
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,912
at the State
Little League Championship.

236
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,315
Pawnee's raccoon infestation.

237
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,234
Have these
little bandits stolen

238
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,219
our sense of safety?

239
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,622
The raccoon problem
is under control.

240
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,906
They have their part
of the town,

241
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,241
and we have ours.

242
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:05,227
Muncie is larger.
Bloomington is more central.

243
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,730
What's the advantage
of doing it in Pawnee?

244
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:11,567
The advantage is
that it's a wonderful city.

245
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,036
I mean, look,
I've been to 40 some odd towns

246
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,938
in Indiana,

247
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,907
and Pawnee is special.

248
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,409
I mean, the people
are passionate and kind.

249
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,278
They love their city.

250
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:25,982
They take pride in their work.

251
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:29,352
It's a very,
very special place.

252
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:36,292
Hey, it's Tom Haverford
back here with Know ya Boo.

253
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,194
Let's move
to the next question.

254
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:41,614
Where is your favorite place
to smush ya boo?

255
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:44,266
- Donna!
- Back of my Benz?

256
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,569
Let's check in with ya boo!

257
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:47,737
Her said her Mercedes!

258
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:50,990
Jerry and Donna on fire.

259
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:53,876
- April?
- This question is gross.

260
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:56,112
That's kind of the point.
What's your answer?

261
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,749
- In our bed, I guess.
- Andy?

262
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,617
Where's your boo's
favorite place to smush?

263
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,919
At the Neutral Milk Hotel.

264
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,055
- Get over it.
- No, you get over it.

265
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:07,340
You like some other dude's
band more than me.

266
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:08,591
Do you even think
that Mouse Rat

267
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:09,925
is the greatest band
in the world?

268
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,460
'Cause it's starting
to not feel that way.

269
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,795
That band is
really important to me,

270
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,530
and, honestly, I've asked you
to listen to them,

271
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:16,098
like, a million times,
and you never have, so...

272
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,317
'cause their music is sad,
and depressing, and weird.

273
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:21,771
And art is supposed to be
happy and fun,

274
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,189
and everyone knows that.

275
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:25,140
You know what?
Whatever. Forget it.

276
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,778
Fine, forget it.

277
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,280
Damn!
This game's got juice.

278
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:34,583
This is your lunch.

279
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,152
Now, you should be able to do
whatever you want to with this,

280
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,254
right?

281
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,089
If you wanna eat
all of it, great.

282
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:41,657
If you wanna throw it away
in the garbage,

283
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,175
that's your prerogative.

284
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,178
But here I come,
the government...

285
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:53,002
And I get to take 40 percent
of your lunch.

286
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,207
And that, Lauren,
is how taxes work.

287
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:00,710
- But that's not fair.
- You're learning.

288
00:11:00,777 --> 00:11:04,547
Uh-oh,
Capital Gains Tax.

289
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:07,416
Well, Chris says
congratulations

290
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:10,185
and that together
we're unstoppable.

291
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,187
- Wow, cheers, sir!
- Yup.

292
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,522
- You did it.
- No, you did it.

293
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,524
No, normally I do it.

294
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,859
This time you did it.

295
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,461
- No.
- You should take the praise.

296
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,396
Can I get a shot of you guys?

297
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:21,797
- Yeah.
- Sure.

298
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,234
Uh, hey,
when this thing's over,

299
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:27,036
do you wanna grab some dinner?

300
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,637
Uh, Chris recommended a place.

301
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,407
- Sure.
- Yeah?

302
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:33,476
Um, hey, we were thinking
about going to dinner,

303
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:34,810
photographer.

304
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:36,645
You want in?
You wanna grab some grub?

305
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:39,432
- Uh, no, thanks.
- They have great burgers.

306
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,617
Well, you don't even know
where we're going yet, so...

307
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:43,569
I'm sure they have
great burgers there, though.

308
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:46,071
Come on, photographer.
Last chance.

309
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:47,923
Uh, okay.

310
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:49,608
Well, then, it's just us then.

311
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:52,528
- Yeah.
- Sure. Okay. I tried.

312
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:56,031
And that, Lauren,
is how FDR ruined this country.

313
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:59,067
Lauren, ready to head back?

314
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,570
Well, I guess it's time
for you to head home.

315
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,739
I've really enjoyed
talking with you.

316
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,925
You are...
and this is not a joke...

317
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:08,010
much smarter
than most of the people

318
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:09,378
who work in this building.

319
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:12,047
I liked talking
with you, too, Mr. Swanson.

320
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,549
Ron.

321
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,418
Hang on, hang on,
I have something for you.

322
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:21,090
This is a Claymore land mine.

323
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:23,759
Use that to protect
your property.

324
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,595
- Thanks, Ron.
- You got it.

325
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:31,700
Tommy Hilfiger
iPhone app finally.

326
00:12:31,768 --> 00:12:34,236
Hey, your stupid
Know your Boo game

327
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:35,905
made me and Andy
get in a big fight.

328
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,406
He just sold his guitar,

329
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:38,958
and he's, like,
quitting music now.

330
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:41,811
What do you want me
to do about it?

331
00:12:41,878 --> 00:12:44,814
Okay, welcome to the super
awesome bonus lightning round.

332
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:46,315
First question...

333
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:49,819
Andy, who did your boo say
makes the best mac and cheese

334
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:50,953
in the universe?

335
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,956
The universe?

336
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,659
Ooh. Kraft?

337
00:12:56,726 --> 00:13:00,663
- April said... Andy!
- Aw.

338
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,631
Best couple ever.
You just won 50 points.

339
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,132
Wait, why?
We got it wrong.

340
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,018
Next lightning round thing.

341
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:10,356
Who is the number one Colts fan
in the world?

342
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:13,876
Wait a minute.

343
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:16,011
You set this whole thing up
so I would be un-mad at you.

344
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,180
Well, guess what,
ain't gonna work.

345
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:20,315
You figured out
April's trying to trick you.

346
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,784
That's worth 100 points.

347
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:25,287
Wait, no.

348
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,322
Good-bye.

349
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,962
You were really great
in that presentation today.

350
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,196
Oh, thanks.

351
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:35,664
I liked the stuff
you said about Pawnee.

352
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,466
That was really nice to hear.

353
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,201
You know, Pawnee
is a really special town.

354
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,937
I, uh, love living there.

355
00:13:42,005 --> 00:13:44,640
And, um...

356
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,709
And I look forward
to the moments in my day

357
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:50,779
where I... I... where I get
to hang out with the town

358
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:53,482
and talk to the town
about stuff.

359
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,685
And the town has
really nice blond hair, too,

360
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,455
and has read a shocking number
of political biographies

361
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:01,323
for a town, which I like.

362
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:03,993
- Oh, God.
- I'm sorry.

363
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,461
And I know
we can get into trouble,

364
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:07,963
but I-I... I can't
take this anymore,

365
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:10,900
and I feel like we have to
at least talk about it.

366
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,469
I mean,
it's not just me, right?

367
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:16,205
No, it's not just you.

368
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Oh, God.

369
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,395
- What? Are you... are...
- Ugh.

370
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,180
- Are you all right?
- Perfect.

371
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,715
I'm gonna go see a man
about some porcelain,

372
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,083
you know what I mean?

373
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,485
I'm not buying cocaine.
I'm going to the bathroom.

374
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:30,986
The whiz palace,
as I like to call it.

375
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:33,388
And I'm not calling Ann, so...

376
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,591
Ann, we have
a serious code Ben.

377
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:37,326
Well, it's not really code
if you say his name.

378
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:38,794
He told me that he liked me,

379
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:40,596
and I'm gonna go make out
with him right now

380
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:41,931
on his face.

381
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:45,084
- That's awesome!
- No, no, read me the script.

382
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:47,002
- Seriously?
- Yes!

383
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,837
All right.

384
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,873
"Leslie, it's Leslie Knope
from the Parks Department

385
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,374
"speaking to you
through Ann Perkins,

386
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:53,592
friend and beautiful nurse."

387
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:55,010
Thank you.

388
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:56,512
"Do not do anything with Ben.

389
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,881
"Be responsible, no matter
how cute his mouth is.

390
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:00,883
Your job is on the line!"

391
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,685
- Shut up, Ann!
- You wrote that.

392
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:05,354
No, you...
then Leslie, Leslie,

393
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:06,722
you don't know
what you're talking about.

394
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,357
I care about him very much,

395
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,526
and I've had 21/2 glasses
of red wine,

396
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,944
and what that means is
I'm gonna go make out with him

397
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:13,429
right now,
and it's gonna be awesome.

398
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,980
Yay!

399
00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:16,765
No, you're supposed
to talk me out of this.

400
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,701
No, don't, stop.

401
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:20,569
Shut up, Ann,
I'm doing it anyway.

402
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:22,237
Yay!

403
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,075
Leslie!

404
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,075
When Ben told me
that you had won the bid,

405
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,869
I was wildly ecstatic,

406
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:34,771
and I had to come up here
and celebrate with you.

407
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:36,473
There is literally nothing
in this world

408
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:38,008
that you cannot do.

409
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:40,544
So, what's the plan now?
Should we take a long walk?

410
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,779
Mini-golf.

411
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,247
I'll probably...
do you...

412
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:45,782
shouldn't we
just go back to Pawnee?

413
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,117
- Yeah.
- Nonsense.

414
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:49,453
There's no reason to drive
all the way back home.

415
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,571
I've got a perfectly good condo
right here in the city.

416
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:53,190
Oh, we couldn't
put you out like that.

417
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:55,425
Double nonsense. I would love
to have you stay with me.

418
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:56,910
Leslie, you can take
the guest room,

419
00:15:56,995 --> 00:16:00,364
and, Ben, you have to sleep
on my couch.

420
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:02,199
It is literally

421
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:03,867
the comfiest couch
you've ever been on.

422
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:10,540
This is weird.

423
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:12,208
We're on Chris' couch.

424
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,928
Yup, we are,
and I'm wearing his clothes.

425
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:22,919
- Uh, well...
- Well...

426
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:25,622
Sorry, I keep myself
very well hydrated,

427
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,758
and my bladder
is the size of a thimble.

428
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:30,060
I urinate
roughly 12 times a night.

429
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:34,297
I think I might go to bed,
too, actually.

430
00:16:34,365 --> 00:16:35,799
Oh, yeah?

431
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,034
Okay.

432
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:39,586
Um, well, look...

433
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:44,124
Good job, again, today.
It was...

434
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,625
- You too.
- Really?

435
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,843
Yeah.

436
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:48,311
Well, that was quick
and to the point.

437
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,080
- Here's a tip.
- Mm?

438
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:52,132
The key to
a healthy urethra... radishes.

439
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:54,317
Good, I'm gonna go to bed.

440
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:56,119
- Good night.
- Good night.

441
00:16:56,187 --> 00:17:00,023
Well, now I'm up.
You wanna boggle?

442
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:03,426
- Are you Ron Swanson?
- I am.

443
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:05,295
Okay, what exactly
did you teach my daughter?

444
00:17:05,363 --> 00:17:07,297
Oh, you must be
Mrs. Berkus.

445
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:08,765
Lauren was supposed
to do a paper

446
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:10,567
on why government matters.

447
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:12,069
This is what she wrote.

448
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:14,654
"It doesn't."

449
00:17:14,739 --> 00:17:16,573
Well said.

450
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:18,375
- Is this a joke?
- No, ma'am.

451
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,710
I legitimately believe that.
I'm a Libertarian.

452
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,946
Oh, that's nice.
Well, she is a fourth grader.

453
00:17:23,014 --> 00:17:24,664
And fourth graders
aren't supposed to have

454
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:26,316
their heads crammed
full of weird ideas.

455
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:27,968
They're supposed to do
cute reports

456
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,086
and get gold stars.

457
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:30,453
I'm very sorry.
I was only...

458
00:17:30,505 --> 00:17:34,091
and you ate her lunch?
And you gave her a land mine?

459
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:35,325
Really?

460
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:38,845
Well, it seemed appropriate
at the time. I...

461
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,098
How?

462
00:17:45,736 --> 00:17:47,737
You know this is
my house, right?

463
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:50,490
- Yeah, hi.
- Do you wanna come in?

464
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,010
- You okay?
- No.

465
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,545
Andy is totally mad
at me right now,

466
00:17:55,613 --> 00:17:56,913
and I don't know
how to deal with him,

467
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:58,682
so I thought I would ask you.

468
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:00,383
You know, Andy and I
broke up so long ago.

469
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:02,352
I... I don't think that
I'd be the best source to...

470
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,421
please.

471
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:05,856
What happened?

472
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:07,591
He doesn't think
I like Mouse Rat.

473
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:10,293
And all I said to him was that
this other band was better,

474
00:18:10,361 --> 00:18:11,761
but I don't know
why he got all mad,

475
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,463
because it's
like an indisputable fact

476
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:14,764
that they're better.
They're a real band.

477
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,216
Oh, boy. Okay.

478
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,102
Well, Andy just wants you to be
proud of him and his music,

479
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,972
so this isn't
really about being right.

480
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,241
It's more about
being supportive.

481
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:25,642
Oh, wow,

482
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,278
I didn't realize you were
a marriage counselor, Ann.

483
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:30,780
Sorry.

484
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,716
My instinct
is to be mean to you.

485
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:35,452
I understand.

486
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,737
O-M-G.

487
00:18:37,822 --> 00:18:39,372
Leslie, I read
that same article...

488
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:40,657
"The history of the ladder."

489
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,875
It's utterly fascinating.

490
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,493
- Ben, you're gonna love this.
- Really?

491
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,762
Do you know that
the original image of a ladder

492
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,914
is in a cave
in Valencia, Spain,

493
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,365
drawn over 10,000 years ago.

494
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:50,884
Oh, my God.
How about some music?

495
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,643
That's amazing.
What is this?

496
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,419
Oh, man, I love this song.

497
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:13,356
♪ The pit, I was in the pit ♪

498
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:15,025
Wait a minute.

499
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:18,028
♪ You were in the pit ♪

500
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,782
♪ we all were in the pit ♪

501
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,868
♪ the pit ♪

502
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:27,704
♪ I was in the pit ♪

503
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:31,041
♪ you were in the pit ♪

504
00:19:31,092 --> 00:19:36,463
♪ we all were in the pit ♪

505
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,134
- What is this?
- Living out my dream.

506
00:19:41,219 --> 00:19:44,221
Playing a show
with the greatest band ever.

507
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:45,255
That's my guitar.

508
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:46,773
You bought it back
from Sewage Joe?

509
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:50,110
I actually stole it
from his office,

510
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:51,628
but whatever.

511
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:53,029
He's a weirdo.

512
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:57,667
Maybe April doesn't think
that we're the greatest band

513
00:19:57,735 --> 00:19:59,869
in the world,
but, man, she loves me,

514
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:02,038
and I love her.

515
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:03,673
So, you know, who cares.

516
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:06,376
I got the greatest wife
in the world!

517
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:08,444
- Stop.
- We're married!

518
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:12,582
We're totally
gonna do it later!

519
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,634
Oh, my God.

520
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:18,088
Well, actually, I think
it's good that Chris showed up,

521
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:19,589
'cause I wasn't
thinking clearly.

522
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:22,158
I love my job,
Ben loves his job,

523
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:24,194
and it's just
not worth the risk.

524
00:20:25,262 --> 00:20:26,363
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

525
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,331
Chris just wanted me
to drop off these receipts.

526
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,400
Oh, well, he's not here.
He took off.

527
00:20:30,467 --> 00:20:32,185
Okay.

528
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:45,682
Uh-oh.

529
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,192
All I'm saying is...
keep an open mind for a while.

530
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,192

and read all the books you can.

531
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:59,092

00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:08,092

00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:11,492

- Sure.
