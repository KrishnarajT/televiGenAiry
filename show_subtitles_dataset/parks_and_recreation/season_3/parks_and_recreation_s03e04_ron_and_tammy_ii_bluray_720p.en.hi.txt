1
00:00:02,721 --> 00:00:03,795
Ron?

2
00:00:04,056 --> 00:00:05,655
Jack Cooper, from the controller's office.

3
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:06,942
Got a... got a second?

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,461
Sure, what can I do you for?

5
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:09,879
Frankly, this is
a little awkward.

6
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:12,481
We've received this letter
from a collection agency

7
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:13,816
about an outstanding debt

8
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:15,951
from the Pawnee Public Library.

9
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,186
It appears
you have an overdue book.

10
00:00:17,254 --> 00:00:18,587
Oh, do I?

11
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:20,689
It's Not the Size of the Boat:

12
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:24,693
Embracing Life with a Micro-Penis.

13
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,395
Tammy.

14
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:28,397
My ex-wife Tammy
likes to check in

15
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:30,299
every so often and make sure

16
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,801
I'm doing okay.

17
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:35,671
And if I am, she tries
to [bleep] everything up.

18
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,606
Okay, I pre-dialed 911,
so all you have to do

19
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:38,674
is press send.

20
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,109
You're worrying over nothing.

21
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:41,744
If she binds your hands
and you can't reach your phone,

22
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:43,546
just try to chew yourself free.

23
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,950
Whale tale.
Whale tale.

24
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:50,019
She's flashing a whale tale.
Abort. Abort.

25
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:51,971
Hello, Tammy.

26
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:54,156
Oh.
Hello, Ron.

27
00:00:54,224 --> 00:00:55,958
I didn't see you come in.

28
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,993
I was just checking myself
for scoliosis.

29
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:00,312
- And?
- Straight as an arrow.

30
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,932
Just like somebody else I know.

31
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:03,966
Jerky?

32
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,868
Call off the dogs.

33
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:07,336
You and I both know

34
00:01:07,404 --> 00:01:09,138
that in my entire adult life,

35
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:12,675
I have never checked
a book out of the library.

36
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:15,027
Oh, my God, she's amazing.

37
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:17,997
Ooh...
Mmm.

38
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:20,382
I admit there was a time
when that sort of behavior

39
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,501
would've driven me wild.

40
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:25,521
But I am in a healthy
relationship now, Tammy.

41
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:28,457
A relationship?
With whom?

42
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:30,559
A lovely, intelligent,
self-possessed

43
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:31,927
pediatric surgeon named Wendy.

44
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:34,430
Sounds like a real whore.

45
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,832
Clear the late charges
and cut the crap.

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,035
Good day.

47
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:41,504
Good day, Leslie.

48
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:44,390
Good... good day.

49
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:57,401
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

50
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:05,728
Okay, so we're ordering them

51
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,581
a total of 30 pizzas
so let's talk toppings.

52
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:10,065
Sausage, onion, and peppers.

53
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:12,301
Scientifically proven
to be the best toppings.

54
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:13,586
Nice.

55
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,204
Should we throw in some salads

56
00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:16,872
for a healthy option?

57
00:02:16,923 --> 00:02:19,475
Wow, don't be such a Jerry, Ben.

58
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:21,410
Yeah, Ben, these guys
are cops, not ballerinas.

59
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,078
So we are throwing
a little shindig

60
00:02:23,146 --> 00:02:25,414
for the police department
because we're asking them

61
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:28,050
to volunteer as security
during the harvest festival.

62
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:30,736
I don't know what it is
about big outdoor gatherings

63
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,422
that makes everyone
want to urinate

64
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,426
all over everything, but it does.

65
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:38,928
And they do.

66
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:42,081
Okay, how about some calzones?

67
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:43,899
Calzones are like pizzas
but they're harder to eat.

68
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:46,635
They're dumb
and so was that idea.

69
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:49,972
- Seriously?
- This is embarrassing for you.

70
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,174
Sorry to interrupt.
Ron, you ready?

71
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:53,609
Absolutely, my dear.

72
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:55,578
I am off to have
a mid-morning pre-lunch

73
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:57,046
with my lady friend,

74
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:58,797
but I will be back
in time for lunch.

75
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:01,283
All right.

76
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,618
Oh, Ron's girlfriend's pretty.

77
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:07,273
Tom's ex-wife.

78
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:10,025
Oh.

79
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:11,310
I don't want to
see them together.

80
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:12,695
It's like they're
rubbing it in my face.

81
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:15,164
So all I can think about
is Captain Mustache

82
00:03:15,232 --> 00:03:16,432
plowing my ex-wife.

83
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:17,566
And you imagine
he's wearing a cape

84
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:19,118
while he's plowing her?

85
00:03:19,202 --> 00:03:20,502
What?

86
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,987
No, just, Captain Mustache?

87
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:24,039
I mean, if all you can think of
is Ron, you know...

88
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:25,708
Maybe put him in some tights
and a cape

89
00:03:25,775 --> 00:03:27,076
and then... and then
it would be funny.

90
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:31,446
Now, I'm imagining a cape.

91
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:32,648
April?

92
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:35,651
Did you call me?

93
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,286
I did call you.
Good ears.

94
00:03:37,337 --> 00:03:40,990
Chris's assistant
went back to Indianapolis,

95
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:44,460
so he's borrowing me
for a few days.

96
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:45,995
Yay.

97
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:47,630
I'd like you to get me
some more post-its.

98
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:49,265
I'd like them in multiple colors.

99
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,699
I'd like green.
I'd like yellow.

100
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,668
Do not buy orange.

101
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:54,637
I do not want orange.
I have plenty of orange.

102
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:55,971
Got it.

103
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,873
You want five million
orange post-its.

104
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:00,859
That's hilarious.

105
00:04:00,944 --> 00:04:06,481
Oh, wait!
I have a post-it for you.

106
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:09,118
- It says, "great job."
- Mmm.

107
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,753
- Great job!
- Mmm.

108
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,788
There you go.

109
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,061
They're getting really old
and I'm an only child.

110
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:21,163
I just feel like
the right thing to do

111
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:24,366
is to move back home.

112
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:26,735
I'm sorry to see you go.

113
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:32,007
I've really come to think
of you as...

114
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:35,477
A companion.

115
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:39,982
Hey, I don't suppose
you'd want to move to Canada?

116
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:45,454
Canada.

117
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:49,074
No, I don't suppose I would.

118
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,093
Hey, I hate to nag,

119
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,578
but shouldn't
we be talking strategy,

120
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:56,665
like, when to ask the chief
for this huge critical favor?

121
00:04:56,716 --> 00:04:58,533
Yes. I know exactly
when we should do it.

122
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:00,469
Post pizza, pre ice cream,

123
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:01,870
between his third
and fourth beer.

124
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:03,839
He'll be full but not stuffed,
tipsy but not drunk.

125
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,040
Should be around 9:00.

126
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:07,276
Okay, so you've
thought this through.

127
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:10,813
Just sit tight.
I'll get you a beer.

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,766
Can I have two beers please?

129
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,067
Hey, you okay?

130
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:17,052
Wendy and I are over.

131
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,887
She's moving back to Canada.

132
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,722
It's too bad.

133
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:23,359
I just taught her how to whittle.

134
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,779
She made me this
tiny sharpened stick.

135
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:29,531
Look, I'm gonna tell you
what I tell all my girlfriends

136
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:31,467
when they get dumped.

137
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:33,035
Men are dogs.

138
00:05:33,103 --> 00:05:34,953
Thank you, Leslie.

139
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,873
That does not apply
to this situation at all.

140
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:40,242
But thank you.
I appreciate it.

141
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:41,977
This is a disaster.

142
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:44,646
You're not into football?

143
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:47,249
I knew there was something
wrong with you.

144
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,585
I knew it.
I knew it, knew it, knew it.

145
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:51,970
Honestly, I haven't felt
this good in years.

146
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,806
And it's not just because
of the supplements

147
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,974
he has me taking
and the soluble fiber

148
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:57,426
and the increase in regularity.

149
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:58,727
It's him.

150
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:00,796
He's, uh, moving back
to Indianapolis

151
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:03,265
in a couple of weeks,
which sucks.

152
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,768
But if he asked me
to move with him,

153
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:08,270
I think I would.

154
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:09,671
I would like a local beer.

155
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:11,490
I'd like it in a bottle.

156
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,075
I'd like the bottle to be cold.

157
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:14,993
I would like
a glass of white wine.

158
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:16,662
I would like it to be chardonnay.

159
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:18,447
And I would like that
with one ice cube.

160
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,949
Thanks.

161
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:23,385
- Chief Trumple?
- Hey, Knope.

162
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:26,305
You know Ben Wyatt
from the State Budget Office.

163
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:27,523
- Yeah, how's it going?
- Hello.

164
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,007
Thanks for the party.
Good pizza.

165
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:32,177
Great. So, yeah, the pizza's
dynamite, isn't it?

166
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:34,029
I just said it was good pizza.

167
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:36,698
It's good.
Pizza's good.

168
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:40,602
You, uh, you know what I like?

169
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,438
Calzones.

170
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:44,306
What the hell
is wrong with this guy?

171
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:45,991
It's all right.
We'll check in with you later.

172
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:47,776
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, will do.

173
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:48,911
What is wrong with you?

174
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:49,995
I was getting somewhere
with that.

175
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,163
Yeah, great small talk
over there.

176
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:52,214
Okay, let me handle this.

177
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,332
I get a little nervous with cops.

178
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,618
- I'm in control.
- What's up?

179
00:06:56,686 --> 00:06:58,504
Tom Haverford's in the building.

180
00:06:58,588 --> 00:06:59,721
Whoo!

181
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:01,823
Tom, what the hell are you doing?

182
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,126
Same thing you're doing,
celebrating Pawnee's finest.

183
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:06,128
I believe you know
my date, Tammy Swanson.

184
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:07,129
Hiya, Ron.

185
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,381
- Oh. Hiya, Ron.
- Hey, Ron.

186
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:10,732
I'm sorry.

187
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,302
Is seeing your ex-wife
on my arm

188
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:14,470
making you uncomfortable?

189
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:17,573
Gee, I can't imagine why.
Or can I?

190
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,892
Ooh, I like this song.
Do you wanna dance, Tammy?

191
00:07:19,976 --> 00:07:20,976
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

192
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:23,395
Ooh. Uh.

193
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,814
I know Tammy seems scary.

194
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:28,150
But really, she's just
a manipulative, psychotic,

195
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:31,053
library-book-pedaling,
sex-crazed she-demon.

196
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:36,682
- I think that's enough.
- Tammy.

197
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,851
Uh. Oh, hi, Ron.

198
00:07:38,902 --> 00:07:41,070
I was just tasting
my new boyfriend, Glenn.

199
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:42,405
Tom.

200
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:43,756
You don't know
what you're mixed up in, son.

201
00:07:43,824 --> 00:07:46,058
This isn't about you.
It's about me.

202
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:48,911
Typical Ron Swanson.
Always thinking about yourself.

203
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:51,697
- Maybe we like each other.
- Yeah, maybe we do.

204
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:53,966
Ah-eey! Okay.

205
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:55,251
Let's take it easy.

206
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:57,703
Tammy, leave him out of this.

207
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,271
Oh, so it's okay for you
to have a girlfriend,

208
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,706
but I'm not supposed
to see anybody?

209
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:02,074
Damn it, woman.

210
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:04,076
Just crawl back in to
the dank hole you came from

211
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:05,544
and leave my friends alone.

212
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:06,846
Oh! Okay, okay.
Let's settle down.

213
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:08,264
What seems to be the problem?

214
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:09,782
- What seems to be the problem?
- Is there a problem here?

215
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,251
Basically what we had here was
a dispute of a domestic nature.

216
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,021
- White male, 40, 45.
- Caucasian male.

217
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:17,456
- Stocky build.
- Approximately 5'10".

218
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:20,126
Verbal altercation transpired
at approximately 8:55 P.M.

219
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:21,394
with a female unsub.

220
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:23,062
Appears to be slightly
intoxicated.

221
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:24,764
Claims to be an ex-spouse.

222
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,399
Real piece of work.

223
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:27,900
- Real piece of work.
- Real piece of work.

224
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,468
Real piece of work.

225
00:08:29,536 --> 00:08:30,903
I know why you're doing this,

226
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:32,121
and you're making a huge mistake.

227
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:33,572
Fight fire with fire, Leslie.

228
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,007
He dates my ex, I date his.

229
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:36,742
Ron and Wendy aren't
even dating anymore.

230
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:38,594
She's moving back to Canada.

231
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,463
- What?
- Uh-oh. Oh, God.

232
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:41,964
Okay, hey.
What's happening here?

233
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,350
Ron and I are going
to get a cup of coffee

234
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:45,351
and talk things out.

235
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,936
It's time for Tammy and me

236
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,022
to bury the hatchet
once and for all.

237
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,092
Everything will be fine.

238
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:01,317
It's been like this for hours.

239
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:02,535
Right there.
Right there.

240
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:04,303
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, Swanson!

241
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,873
Snap out of it!

242
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:09,441
Leslie.

243
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:10,776
Congratulate us.

244
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:14,380
Ron's got one
just like it on his penis.

245
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:16,281
Oh, yeah.

246
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,050
What the hell happened to you?

247
00:09:18,118 --> 00:09:20,386
Well...

248
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:31,180
Thank you.

249
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:35,518
Rock and roll!
Yeah, baby!

250
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:36,819
- I got it!
- Uh!

251
00:09:36,903 --> 00:09:38,154
You may now kiss the bride.

252
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:48,531
♪ ♪

253
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:51,033
It's been kind of a crazy night.

254
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:52,334
Come back, come back.

255
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:56,872
April, could you
come in here a second?

256
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:59,358
April, way to come in.
Great initiative.

257
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:01,326
You called me in.

258
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:03,028
Listen, could you please
call Ann Perkins

259
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:04,880
and tell her that I will be
unable to enjoy lunch

260
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:07,233
with her today,
as I am just swamped.

261
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,267
All day.

262
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:10,836
Copy that.

263
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,172
Hi, Ann.
This is April.

264
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:14,840
I'm just calling to let you know

265
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:16,859
that Chris can't
make lunch today.

266
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:20,729
I knew you wouldn't care.
Good-bye.

267
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,314
They started having sex
at the court house.

268
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:23,616
We had no choice.

269
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:25,584
Oh, well,
I completely understand.

270
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:27,853
Chief, I need to ask you
a huge favor.

271
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:29,121
Leslie.

272
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:30,739
Ron is a good man

273
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,291
who just got caught up
in something terrible.

274
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,794
And I was hoping that maybe
you would

275
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:38,430
reduce his charges and
release him into my custody.

276
00:10:38,498 --> 00:10:39,882
All right.

277
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,134
But keep him away
from that crazy librarian.

278
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:43,803
I'll do my best.

279
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,920
In fact, I don't want him

280
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,072
within 500 feet of the library.

281
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,641
That's good advice for all of us.

282
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:49,892
Nothing but trouble there.

283
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:52,611
- Thanks a lot, bro.
- Hey, stop.

284
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,597
Sorry.

285
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:57,433
Take me back to Tammy.

286
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:59,151
For the millionth time, no.

287
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:01,403
That was not the favor
we needed to ask for, Leslie.

288
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:03,489
If we don't get the police
for the harvest festival,

289
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:05,324
there is no harvest festival.

290
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:06,942
I know.
I'll figure it out later.

291
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:09,912
Can you turn the radio off.
This is our song.

292
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:11,730
Your song is
Dancing on the Ceiling

293
00:11:11,781 --> 00:11:13,749
by Lionel Ritchie?

294
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,334
Oh, wow, look at that.

295
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:16,535
You shaved off
part of your mustache.

296
00:11:16,603 --> 00:11:17,636
That's lovely.

297
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:21,173
I didn't shave it off.
It rubbed off...

298
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,541
From friction.

299
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:23,676
Uhh!

300
00:11:23,743 --> 00:11:25,044
Uhhh!

301
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:26,128
Uhh!

302
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:28,247
Ron Swanson,
this is an intervention.

303
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:30,482
You have been spending
the last 24 hours

304
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,552
sipping on joy juice
and tripping on Tammy.

305
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,804
Well, the people in this room
are your methadone.

306
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,473
And we're here to get you clean.

307
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:39,942
Congratulations.

308
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:43,312
Holy matrimony,
there's the man of the hour.

309
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:45,447
Jerry, what is this?

310
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:46,565
That is the set of tumblers

311
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,133
that I got from the registry.

312
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:49,969
This is an intervention.

313
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:51,287
I thought you said on the phone

314
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,538
it was a reception.

315
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:54,607
Okay.
All right, let's begin.

316
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:57,493
I would like to address
the goofy-looking,

317
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:00,646
dirty-kimono-wearing,
corn-rowed clown in the room.

318
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:05,251
If you see Ron Swanson,
can you give him this message?

319
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:07,519
You used to be a man.

320
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:09,622
You need to get
your house in order.

321
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:11,590
Look, I love you like a brother

322
00:12:11,658 --> 00:12:13,759
but right now, I hate you

323
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,661
like my actual brother,
Levondrious,

324
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,963
who I hate.

325
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:18,981
Okay, Tom.

326
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:20,966
Ron, you look great.

327
00:12:21,017 --> 00:12:23,235
Your skin is glowing.
I've never seen you so happy.

328
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,237
Okay, sit down.

329
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:27,472
Andy.

330
00:12:27,524 --> 00:12:30,576
Ron, I do not really understand

331
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:32,578
what is going on right now.

332
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:37,833
But no matter what,

333
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:40,352
you must keep going.

334
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,687
No.

335
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:44,490
You must stop.

336
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,458
I love you, buddy.

337
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:49,561
Follow your dreams.

338
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:51,363
Powerful stuff.

339
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:56,501
April?
What are you doing here?

340
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:59,571
I work for your boyfriend.
What are you doing here?

341
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,007
I came to see why Chris
stood me up for lunch,

342
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,442
but I think I just
figured it out.

343
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:04,660
Because he doesn't like you.

344
00:13:04,744 --> 00:13:06,211
No, I'm pretty sure
that's not it.

345
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:09,214
Actually it's because
I didn't call you deliberately.

346
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:11,717
Which, if you ask me,
is a fireable offense.

347
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:13,319
So I would tell him that.

348
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:15,955
Also, he's not into you sexually.

349
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:17,756
- Mmm.
- Ann Perkins.

350
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:18,974
April Ludgate.

351
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,226
Literally two of
my favorite people on earth.

352
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,628
I'm sorry that I had
to cancel lunch.

353
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:24,963
Not at all.
It's not a problem.

354
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:27,833
April here was very
apologetic on the phone.

355
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,268
She also sent me flowers.

356
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:32,071
April.
Nice touch.

357
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:38,110
Hello, Ron.
It's Ron.

358
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:41,747
If you're watching this,
it means that once again

359
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:43,649
you have danced with the devil.

360
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,617
Right now,
you're probably thinking

361
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:47,386
Tammy's changed.

362
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:48,988
We'll be happy together.

363
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:50,422
But you're only thinking that

364
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,624
because she's
a monstrous parasite

365
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,910
who entered through your privates

366
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:57,296
and lodged herself in your brain.

367
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:59,214
So you have two choices...

368
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,533
One, get rid of Tammy,

369
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:04,970
or two, lobotomy and castration.

370
00:14:05,038 --> 00:14:06,839
Choose wisely.

371
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:09,775
You stupid.

372
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:12,144
This is a waste of time.

373
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:15,547
You people have no idea
what you're talking about.

374
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,917
That was you on the tape.
That was you talking.

375
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:20,686
Ron? Ron!

376
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:23,856
Ron.
Oh, there you are.

377
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,992
Ah!

378
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,495
Ron. Stop it.
God, please.

379
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:33,115
- Ron, don't do that.
- Oh, it's done, Leslie.

380
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,800
Tammy and I are in love,

381
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:36,902
and we're gonna start a family
together.

382
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:39,171
In fact, she's ovulating.

383
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,706
So if you'll excuse us,

384
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:42,541
we're heading off
on our honeymoon.

385
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:45,978
- Wow. Where are you going?
- Jerry.

386
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:48,781
We're gonna spend 11 days
in my cabin in the woods.

387
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,716
We bought 10 cases of Gatorade

388
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:53,519
and a 40-pound bag
of peanuts for energy.

389
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:56,438
- Oh, God.
- Give me it.

390
00:14:56,523 --> 00:15:00,092
All right, okay.
Excuse me.

391
00:15:00,143 --> 00:15:02,094
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God.

392
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:04,949
Ann and I are headed out

393
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:06,403
and I just wanted to thank you

394
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,655
for everything today,
and I will see you tomorrow.

395
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:12,170
Hi, Chris.

396
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:14,538
Uh, Ron Swanson has sent me over

397
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,308
to deliver to you this document.

398
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,578
"To whom it may concern,
dear Chris,

399
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,381
"there is an emergency regarding
the Parks Department,

400
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,384
"and April may just be
the only person who can help.

401
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:30,255
"I can't get into details
because it's super-classified.

402
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:32,423
"Please release April
back to us permanently.

403
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:34,292
"God bless America.

404
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,396
Love, Bert Macklin, FBI."

405
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:39,497
What?

406
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,199
Okay. Well, bye.

407
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,733
April, listen.

408
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:44,569
If you don't want to work for me,

409
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:45,803
I'm not gonna force you.

410
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:47,071
You didn't have to do this.

411
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:48,406
She didn't do that.
That... that was...

412
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,174
Dude, I think it sounds
like it was Macklin's call.

413
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,409
Look, I get it.

414
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:54,879
You're young,
and trying isn't cool.

415
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:56,314
But I think you're smart.

416
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:59,050
I'm gonna be going back
to Indianapolis soon,

417
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:01,519
and I think you should
come work for me.

418
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,322
Wow, move all the way
to Indianapolis,

419
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,125
so I can pick up your
vitamins and supplements.

420
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:09,060
Everybody starts somewhere.

421
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:10,295
You'll travel,

422
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:12,664
and you will meet
interesting people.

423
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:14,565
Think about it.

424
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,835
Okay. I will.

425
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,737
Apparently he wants April

426
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:22,740
to move to Indianapolis with him.

427
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,209
So that's something.

428
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,347
I hope you're happy.

429
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:32,717
Look, I just wanted to
show him what it felt like

430
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,219
to have your ex-wife
date someone you know.

431
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,755
Whatever happened after that
is not my fault.

432
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:38,840
Yes, it is.

433
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:41,142
Tom, you did
a really crappy thing,

434
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:43,428
and I think deep down,
you know that.

435
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:47,598
Whatever happens
to Ron Swanson is on you.

436
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,773
Excuse me, chief.
Sorry to interrupt.

437
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:57,742
Hey, calzone boy, what's up?

438
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,811
Well, here's hoping that
that nickname doesn't stick.

439
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:03,581
Right?

440
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,616
But that's not why I'm here.

441
00:17:05,684 --> 00:17:09,520
Uh, Leslie Knope asked you
for a favor the other day,

442
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:11,522
but the real favor we need
is much bigger.

443
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,125
You mean,
like calzone-sized?

444
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:17,395
Ah! Sure.

445
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:19,464
We need the Pawnee police force

446
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:20,732
to volunteer as security

447
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,833
during the upcoming
harvest festival.

448
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,969
Now, the city won't let us
throw the festival unless...

449
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,571
Say no more.

450
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:28,373
Just send me a schedule of how
many officers you need and when.

451
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,742
Really?
Just like that?

452
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,111
Leslie Knope gets
as many favors as she needs.

453
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,046
Can I ask why?

454
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:37,365
Because she's
the kind of a person

455
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:39,217
who uses favors
to help other people.

456
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:41,152
And also, my buddy Dave

457
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:42,587
was the crankiest bastard
in the department

458
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:43,955
till he started dating Leslie.

459
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:47,691
Huh. So she...
Okay.

460
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:49,527
Are they still dating or...?

461
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:52,563
No. Moved to San Diego
a year ago.

462
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:54,465
Oh.

463
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,467
Was it a serious thing, or...?

464
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,636
What do you care?
You a pervert?

465
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,071
Nope, nope.
I'm all good.

466
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:01,672
Um, everything's fine.

467
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:03,674
This is fine.

468
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,544
Don't think I won't do it.

469
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:07,578
I'll wear this to work.

470
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:11,048
All right, we got a little one.

471
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,900
Ooh, what's in here, huh?

472
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:15,570
A new library card?

473
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:16,821
Read the name.

474
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,322
"Tammy Swanson Swanson."

475
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:21,659
You guys, that's amazing.

476
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,747
Well, you about ready
to go, my love?

477
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,231
- Yeah.
- Wait, Ron!

478
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,399
Stop!

479
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,334
Jerry, what the hell?

480
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,736
Don't do it.
She doesn't love you.

481
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,622
You don't know what
you're talking about.

482
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:35,673
What are you doing here?

483
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,909
Yes, I do, okay?

484
00:18:37,976 --> 00:18:38,926
When I asked her to be my date,

485
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,044
she cackled for a full minute

486
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:42,647
and said, and I quote,

487
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:45,550
"anything to make Ron
miserable."

488
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,585
It's not real, man.

489
00:18:47,636 --> 00:18:48,770
She's just messing with you.

490
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:51,522
He's lying, Ron.
Stay out of this, Glenn.

491
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,458
It's Tom.
And I'm not lying.

492
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:54,976
I'm not gonna let you
destroy Ron.

493
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,644
You're just gonna
have to... Ow!

494
00:18:56,728 --> 00:18:58,362
Ow! Aah!

495
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,465
Oh!
He's attacking me, Ron!

496
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,567
Kill him!

497
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:13,044
Yeah!
Do your worst, Glenn!

498
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,078
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

499
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:15,513
- Aaaah!
- Aah!

500
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:18,800
Why are you
hitting yourself, Glenn?

501
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:20,334
Stop hitting yourself.

502
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:22,386
Tammy, that's enough!

503
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,554
What?

504
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,339
Hey, baby.

505
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:27,658
You almost had me.

506
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:29,794
Again.

507
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:31,863
But seeing you pick
on this pathetic,

508
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,097
defenseless little man...

509
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:34,332
Hey.

510
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:36,968
Reminded me what kind
of a monster you are.

511
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,135
You're a joke.

512
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:40,104
You're not even a man anymore.

513
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:42,156
Oh, and by the way, last night,

514
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,192
I faked four out of the seven.

515
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:47,211
Hmm. So did I.

516
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,163
Let's go, son.

517
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:57,722
- Hey.
- Hey.

518
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:58,956
Sorry about the whole mess.

519
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:00,675
The crisis has been averted,

520
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,793
so let's go talk to the chief.

521
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:04,095
Oh, I already talked to him.

522
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,997
They'll give us the hours
we need, no problem.

523
00:20:06,064 --> 00:20:08,533
- Great. What a relief.
- Yeah.

524
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:12,720
Hey, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten.

525
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:13,871
You know, yeah.

526
00:20:13,939 --> 00:20:14,872
There's a really great
calzone place

527
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,107
over in Idiotville.

528
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,842
- Oh, really?
- Down on Terrible Idea Avenue.

529
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,310
Okay. That's weird.

530
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:23,581
'Cause I thought it was on
beating-a-dead-horse boulevard.

531
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,216
Calzones are pointless.

532
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:27,351
They're just pizza
that's harder to eat.

533
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:29,554
No one likes them.

534
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:30,955
Good day, sir.

535
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,875
Leslie, I...
you know, I...

536
00:20:33,959 --> 00:20:35,626
I'm just kidding.
Let's go.

537
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:36,860
Oh.

538
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:38,963
Okay. That was funny.

539
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:44,420
High and tight.

540
00:20:44,505 --> 00:20:46,506
Do you think
it's gonna leave a scar?

541
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:48,241
Tom, women like scars.

542
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,043
Shows you survived an attack,

543
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:53,079
and they'll assume
the attack was from a man.

544
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,216
Sorry, Ron, about everything.

545
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:57,584
Ah.

546
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:59,118
To true love.

547
00:20:59,186 --> 00:21:00,937
May we both find it.

548
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:03,456
I'll drink to that.

549
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:05,625
Nice glasses.

550
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:07,760
Wedding present from Jerry.

551
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:08,761
You're not gonna return them?

552
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,997
Nah.
Too much hassle.

553
