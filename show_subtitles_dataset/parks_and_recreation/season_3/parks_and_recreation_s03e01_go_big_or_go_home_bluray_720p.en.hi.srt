1
00:00:03,482 --> 00:00:05,366
Giddyup, giddyup!

2
00:00:05,451 --> 00:00:06,584
Meet Leslie Knope.

3
00:00:06,652 --> 00:00:07,852
Whap!

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,220
I am the pants queen!

5
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:10,872
Leslie loves whipped cream,

6
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:12,257
dancing with friends,

7
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,125
and working hard
for the Parks Department

8
00:00:14,176 --> 00:00:15,210
of Pawnee, Indiana.

9
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:16,494
Cut it out, Tom.

10
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:17,512
It never gets old.

11
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:18,680
She also loves her coworkers

12
00:00:18,747 --> 00:00:20,048
at City Hall,

13
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:22,800
Ron Swanson...

14
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:24,102
Tom Haverford...

15
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:27,222
Tommy Timberlake.

16
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:28,356
April Ludgate...

17
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,108
My mom's Puerto Rican.

18
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:32,143
That's why I'm so lively
and colorful.

19
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:34,395
And Andy Dwyer.

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,547
Uh-oh.

21
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:36,781
Nailed it.

22
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:39,117
April and Andy like each other.

23
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:40,718
But Andy accidentally kissed

24
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:42,654
his ex-girlfriend,
Ann Perkins...

25
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,788
Ooh.

26
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:46,074
- April left.
- April!

27
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:47,292
And he hasn't seen her since.

28
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,960
In the midst of all this love,

29
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:51,329
two black hats rode
into town...

30
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:52,931
Scientists believe
that the first human being

31
00:00:52,998 --> 00:00:54,032
who will live 150 years

32
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:55,867
has already been born.

33
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:57,502
I believe I am
that human being.

34
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:00,889
And they brought with them
some disturbing news.

35
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:02,040
Effective tomorrow morning,

36
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:03,441
the entire government
will be shut down

37
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:04,842
until further notice.

38
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,911
What will Leslie do next?

39
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:10,181
Will April and Andy
make up and make out?

40
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:12,150
Find out this season
on Parks and Recreation.

41
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:13,785
Starting right now.

42
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:22,994
Ron... We're back.

43
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:24,078
Bully.

44
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:25,630
The bankrupt government
of Pawnee

45
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:27,999
has been shut down all summer,

46
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,334
so it's been three months
of no work,

47
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:31,920
no meetings, no memos,
no late nights, nothing.

48
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,504
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

49
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:35,590
Oh, rounding up the team.

50
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:37,175
So exciting.

51
00:01:37,242 --> 00:01:40,461
I have goosebumps.
Feel.

52
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:43,147
And that's why they call me
Prince Charming.

53
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:44,449
'Cause I always find
the glass slipper

54
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,767
for my Cinderella.

55
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:47,118
These are way too tight.

56
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:49,020
Well, the real Cinderella
didn't have hippo feet.

57
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:50,271
Tom, we're back.

58
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,524
Jeremy!
Suck it!

59
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:54,993
By the way, I've been
giving away free sports bras

60
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,629
to the girls
at hot dog on a stick.

61
00:01:57,696 --> 00:01:59,430
Look, we can dance all day,

62
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:00,698
but it's time to step up.

63
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:03,067
Are you buying
4,000 rubber nipples from me

64
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:04,986
or not?

65
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,154
Dee, you have a visitor.

66
00:02:06,238 --> 00:02:07,488
We back?

67
00:02:07,573 --> 00:02:08,606
We're back.

68
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:09,607
All right.

69
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,495
- Jerry.
- Oh, my gosh.

70
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,047
Look who's here.
Leslie.

71
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,966
The nightmare's over, Jerry.
We're going back to work.

72
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,802
You're not gonna need
this anymore.

73
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,504
Come on!

74
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:28,926
I called shotgun.
Everybody heard me.

75
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:41,564
Sync by honeybunny

76
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:50,531
Well...

77
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:53,751
I am usually not one
for speeches.

78
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,752
So good-bye.

79
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,337
Break's over, mofos.

80
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:57,422
Okay, here's the situation.

81
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,707
We are operating
on a shoestring budget.

82
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,926
Park services
have been slashed.

83
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:04,212
But we are all still here.

84
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:05,763
And we have a job to do.

85
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,349
Make the world's biggest pizza.

86
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:09,801
No, make this town fun

87
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:11,102
for the people who live here.

88
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,103
Fine, but after that,

89
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,521
the pizza is our top priority.

90
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:14,772
No, it's not.

91
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,357
We're getting pizza?

92
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:19,694
April, hey.
It's me, Andy.

93
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:21,179
Dwyer.

94
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:24,115
Uh, this is, like,
the 200th message I've left you

95
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:25,750
without a response.

96
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:26,901
So...

97
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:29,320
If you're trying
to tell me something,

98
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:31,122
I do not know what it is

99
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,558
because you won't call me back.

100
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,593
It is truly great
to see all of you.

101
00:03:35,661 --> 00:03:37,128
Huh?

102
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,696
It's great news.

103
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:41,199
Okay, I have to run.
Ben.

104
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:44,268
The bad news, which...

105
00:03:44,336 --> 00:03:46,571
I get to deliver, is this:

106
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,206
Your only work
for the time being

107
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:50,541
will be existing
park maintenance.

108
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:51,709
So that just means

109
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:52,710
that we're in maintenance mode!

110
00:03:52,778 --> 00:03:54,145
Yeah!

111
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,097
Jerry.

112
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:57,915
Okay, see, I've spent
the last few months

113
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:58,933
brainstorming,

114
00:03:59,017 --> 00:03:59,934
and I have
some really great ideas,

115
00:04:00,018 --> 00:04:01,552
and I put them
in my idea binders.

116
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:03,221
I mean, they're color-coded,
for God's sake.

117
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:04,322
Okay, actually, yeah.
There is...

118
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,074
There is one thing
that you will be doing.

119
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:07,492
Apparently, in Indiana,

120
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,993
if you don't provide
a basketball league,

121
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,411
people get very upset.

122
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,463
And, quite frankly,
throw things at you

123
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:14,065
and call you names.

124
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,967
Like turd boy.
I... whatever.

125
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:18,202
Point is, I reinstated
youth basketball.

126
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,954
It says here you only have
money for two teams.

127
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:22,290
Yeah, they're gonna develop
a great rivalry.

128
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:25,877
Under my tutelage,
you will grow

129
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:27,245
from boys into men.

130
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:29,847
From men into gladiators.

131
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:33,101
And from gladiators
into Swansons.

132
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:35,136
Behold.

133
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,522
The Swanson pyramid
of greatness.

134
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:40,358
I've been developing
the Swanson pyramid of greatness

135
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:41,459
for years.

136
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,778
It's a perfectly
calibrated recipe

137
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:45,763
for maximum personal
achievement.

138
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:47,565
Categories include:

139
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,817
Capitalism, God's way
of determining

140
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:51,903
who is smart, and who is poor.

141
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:54,906
Crying, acceptable at funerals

142
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:56,307
and the Grand Canyon.

143
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,843
Rage, poise, property rights.

144
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,962
Fish, for sport only.

145
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,213
Not for meat.

146
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,998
Fish meat is practically
a vegetable.

147
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:04,999
Haircuts.

148
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,116
There are three
acceptable haircuts.

149
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:07,785
High and tight,

150
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:10,188
crew cut, buzz cut.

151
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:12,623
Are the scissors broken
in your house, son?

152
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:14,826
So you happy
to be back at work?

153
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:16,894
Well, our budget's
been slashed to zero.

154
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:18,479
I tried to buy fertilizer
the other day

155
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:19,630
for the soccer field.

156
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,182
Request denied.

157
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,934
We literally can't buy shit.

158
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,702
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, I mean, look.

159
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,003
When we were kids,

160
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,172
the Parks Department
would do these big projects.

161
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,442
Winter Jamboree,
the Harvest Festival.

162
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,578
It's like they don't have faith
in us anymore.

163
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:35,246
I'm not a paper-pusher,
Ann.

164
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:36,747
I need to be out
in the streets,

165
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:38,315
planting trees
and cracking skulls.

166
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,218
Leslie Knope.
Ann Perkins.

167
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,319
How are my two favorite people
in this entire town?

168
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:43,538
Not good, Chris.

169
00:05:43,622 --> 00:05:44,989
There's a whole line of people
in my office

170
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,057
complaining that
all their programs

171
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:47,375
have been slashed.

172
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,593
Yeah, I know.
It's terrible.

173
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,596
Is there anything
we can do about that?

174
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:52,697
- No.
- Damn, sorry, Leslie.

175
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:54,665
Ann, could I talk to you
for a minute?

176
00:05:58,203 --> 00:06:00,071
- So how's it going?
- Save it, okay?

177
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,106
I know you don't have
faith in me

178
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:03,441
and my department,
and that's fine.

179
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:04,742
But don't expect me to sit here

180
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,110
and chit-chat with you.

181
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:07,745
All right, fair enough.

182
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:08,880
Go the other way.

183
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:11,048
But I'm just going to that...

184
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,617
All right, uh...

185
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:14,619
Look, I'm very flattered.

186
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:15,620
But again, I don't think

187
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:17,288
I should go out with you.

188
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:18,856
Can I ask you why not?

189
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:20,024
Because I thought
we had a great time

190
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:22,193
the night you got drunk
and kissed me.

191
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:24,629
And you did use your tongue.

192
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,464
I just don't think
I'm in a place

193
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,399
to go out with anyone
right now.

194
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,867
Okay, well,

195
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:30,885
if you change your mind,

196
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:32,420
you know where
to find me, Ann Perkins.

197
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:34,038
Leslie Knope.

198
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,007
Yes.
Did he ask you out again?

199
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,892
He did, he did.

200
00:06:37,976 --> 00:06:40,094
He is nothing
if not persistent.

201
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,846
And hot.

202
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:43,915
He's ver...
he's pretty hot.

203
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:44,932
Yeah, he's hot.

204
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:46,100
But he's intense.

205
00:06:46,184 --> 00:06:47,485
But he's really, really hot.

206
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:48,603
But he's your boss.

207
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,154
Oh, my God,
I just thought of an idea

208
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:51,555
of how we can save
the Parks Department.

209
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:52,890
Great.

210
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:53,991
Let me ask you one question.

211
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,826
Would you be cool doing things

212
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:56,894
that a prostitute does?

213
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:58,663
Uh...

214
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,897
Minus the money.

215
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,116
Definitely yes, then.

216
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,301
Thanks, Ann.

217
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:05,286
Looking sharp.
Beautiful.

218
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,171
The backboard is your friend.

219
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:10,474
Aaaa, bam!

220
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,842
Boom!

221
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,629
I'd say my coaching style
is centered

222
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:15,947
around fundamentals,

223
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:17,181
with an emphasis on fun.

224
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:18,933
Hey, watch this.

225
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,601
Go get it!

226
00:07:20,686 --> 00:07:24,121
And a second emphasis
on mental.

227
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:25,856
Yeah, it can be hard work,

228
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:26,857
but every time I look

229
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,593
one of these kids in the eyes

230
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,095
and he calls me coach...

231
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:34,315
That's how I know
I agreed to be a coach.

232
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:35,933
Mouse rat!

233
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:38,369
Carnage!

234
00:07:38,436 --> 00:07:39,954
Okay, gentlemen, it's time

235
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:42,106
for the pregame coin toss.

236
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,941
There's no coin toss
in basketball.

237
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:45,326
Are those women's sneakers?

238
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,111
Yes, they are, Ron.
You know what?

239
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:49,664
They fit better.
I got an employee discount.

240
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:50,681
And the best part is,

241
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:52,049
no one can tell.

242
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:53,951
All right, let's do this.

243
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,954
Match point,
touchdown, et cetera.

244
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:00,808
Yeah, go my team.
All right.

245
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,226
Okay, I like
what you're wearing,

246
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:04,228
but I need it to be
300% sexier.

247
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:05,463
Do you have any of those shirts

248
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,398
that look wet all the time?

249
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,633
Or... or, like,
a metal bikini?

250
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,267
Oh, you know what's
always sexy?

251
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:11,802
Fingerless gloves.

252
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,905
What about if I wear
this normal, sane outfit?

253
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:15,973
Yeah, okay,
but you're gonna have to eat

254
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,658
something sexy, then,
like a banana.

255
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:18,859
For dinner?

256
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:19,944
Well, what's sexy food?

257
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:21,245
Asparagus?

258
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:22,530
No, you know what's sexy?

259
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:24,448
Turkey chili.

260
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:25,983
- Mmm.
- Yum.

261
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:27,451
And how, exactly,

262
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,521
am I supposed to casually steer
the conversation

263
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:32,323
towards the Parks
Department budget?

264
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,691
Okay, it's totally easy.

265
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,559
Tell you what.
You be Chris.

266
00:08:35,627 --> 00:08:37,294
I'll be you.
I'll show you how it's done.

267
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:38,512
Okay.

268
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:39,730
Ann Perkins.

269
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:41,265
You are wonderful and amazing,

270
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,667
and I'm happy
to be here with you.

271
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:43,668
Thank you, Chris.

272
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,903
I'm wearing a tuxedo vest

273
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:47,855
with no shirt on underneath.

274
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:49,006
Uh-oh.

275
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:50,207
Can I get you a drink?

276
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,226
I love every single beverage
in the world.

277
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,778
I would like some wine.

278
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:56,614
And, oops, my vest popped open.

279
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:59,450
Just like the budget
needs to pop open,

280
00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:01,585
and you need to pour it

281
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:03,554
into my Parks Department.

282
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,222
Great.

283
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,325
I am so excited
that you finally agreed

284
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:09,694
to go out with me.

285
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,462
What a magnificent
flip-flop.

286
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,032
You're a magnificent
asker-outer.

287
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,568
Tell me every single detail
of your day.

288
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,270
I love dates.

289
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,871
I love connecting with someone.

290
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:22,640
I love engaging them.

291
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,742
I love being surprised by them.

292
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,243
I have never had a bad date.

293
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:28,946
They've all been either great
or phenomenally great.

294
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:31,315
Nurses are the most
undervalued members

295
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:33,050
of our society by far.

296
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:35,319
I think all of you
should make as much money

297
00:09:35,387 --> 00:09:36,320
as the CEO of Google.

298
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:39,790
Wow, thank you.
I agree.

299
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:41,409
Can I ask you a question?

300
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,727
Why am I so positive
all the time?

301
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:46,831
Yes, that's exactly
the question.

302
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,799
I was born
with a blood disorder.

303
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,234
And my parents were told

304
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,902
that I had three weeks to live.

305
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,904
And here I still am,

306
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:57,241
some 2,000-odd weeks later.

307
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:02,880
And I have enjoyed
every one of them.

308
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:04,381
I think it's going well.

309
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:06,717
He's actually
a really nice guy.

310
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:07,968
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:09,220
Okay, so have you asked him
yet about the money?

312
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:10,471
Well, it's a date, you know?

313
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:11,789
It's kind of hard
to casually bring up

314
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:12,957
the Parks budget
when you're talking

315
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:14,141
about your favorite movies.

316
00:10:14,226 --> 00:10:17,445
Jurassic Park,
parks are so great,

317
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:18,729
the Parks Department
needs money.

318
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:19,947
I just did it in three moves.

319
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,031
Well, then, why don't you
just come here

320
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:22,032
and do it yourself?

321
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,234
- Okay.
- Holy crap.

322
00:10:24,326 --> 00:10:27,193
What? Chris and Ann?
What are you two doing here?

323
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:28,229
We are on a date.

324
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,330
And it is going phenomenally.

325
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:31,914
Thanks, but I'll stay
for just one drink.

326
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,883
I'm so happy I ran into you

327
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:35,451
because I wanted
to speak to you...

328
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
- Well, well, well.
- Ben.

329
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:40,006
- What a fun surprise.
- Oh, that's right.

330
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,758
You were coming here tonight
on a date.

331
00:10:41,825 --> 00:10:43,826
And, hey, Leslie is joining you

332
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,145
on this wonderfully
romantic occasion.

333
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,563
How 'bout that?

334
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,232
- Fantastic.
- It is.

335
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:50,566
Can I talk to you?

336
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:51,901
- Sure.
- What are you doing here?

337
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:53,403
I'm just confirming
a suspicion I had, Leslie.

338
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,537
What are you talking about?

339
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:55,855
I had nothing to do
with this date.

340
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,073
- Uh-huh.
- They're both so beautiful.

341
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,541
They probably just want
to see each other naked.

342
00:10:58,609 --> 00:10:59,976
Okay, well, I know
what you're trying to do.

343
00:11:00,044 --> 00:11:01,344
And you're not that good
at being sneaky.

344
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,162
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

345
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:04,764
- I'm great at being sneaky.
- Clearly you're not.

346
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:05,915
Hey, you guys.

347
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:07,950
Let's all have dinner together.

348
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:09,385
The more the merrier.

349
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:11,387
- Great.
- Great.

350
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,389
Good job, guys.
Yep.

351
00:11:13,457 --> 00:11:14,490
All right, Eric, taking a rest,

352
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,792
or are you hurt?

353
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,710
Taking a rest?

354
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,128
Smart.

355
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,179
Destroy them, gentlemen.

356
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:23,332
Feel no sympathy.

357
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,270
Yes, Ron Swanson is dating
my ex-wife, Wendy.

358
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:29,272
Big deal.

359
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,273
My girlfriend, Lucy,

360
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,774
is the sexiest woman in town.

361
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,376
She's Cuban, she's got tattoos,

362
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:34,744
and she's into me,

363
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:36,062
which, as far as I'm concerned,

364
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:38,815
is the sexiest quality
a woman can have.

365
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:40,016
Oh, I have an idea.

366
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:41,751
You know what would be
really fun after dinner?

367
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,953
We should take a walk
by the pond in Ramsett Park.

368
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,555
Walking in parks can be
very romantic.

369
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,623
Yeah, too bad the park's
always closed, though.

370
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:49,559
Okay, well,
you two are on a date.

371
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:53,880
So Leslie and I
should probably get going.

372
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,715
Uh, well, I'm actually
having a good time

373
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,716
with everyone.

374
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,418
Chris?

375
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:00,069
Oh, me, too.
I'm having a fantastic time.

376
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,070
What do you say we take
this whole

377
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,572
date-plus-two-
other-people thing

378
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,756

00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:13,766
Great call, Leslie Knope.

385
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:14,784
Thanks.

386
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:17,420
Look, even Ben's dancing.

387
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,023
That's the way
to shoot the ball, Chignoli.

388
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,024
Hustle back.

389
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,464
Uh...

390
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:29,599
It's a foul.

391
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,284
What?
On whom?

392
00:12:31,368 --> 00:12:32,318
Your team.

393
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:34,437
Number 50.
He was double dribbling.

394
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,438
He's on defense.

395
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,323
Exactly.

396
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:38,608
It's a technical difficulty,
so that means

397
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,259
Andy's team throws the ball

398
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,410
from the stripey thing.

399
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:42,428
Let's go.

400
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,297
The stripey thing?

402
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,638
Hey, there.

403
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:54,256
How's it going?

404
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:56,292
Great, thanks.

405
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,276
Can I buy you a drink?

406
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:00,029
Oh, I'm very flattered,

407
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,981
but this is my
stunningly gorgeous date,

408
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:02,999
Ann Perkins.

409
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:04,834
Oh, hi.

410
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:06,786
- Hi.
- Sorry.

411
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,237
Oh, no problem.

412
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,323
In fact, let me buy
all of you a drink

413
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:11,657
for being so welcoming today.

414
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:12,792
Waiter.

415
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:18,181
I think I may
actually like Chris.

416
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:19,382
On the house, Leslie.

417
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,667
Oh, thank you.

418
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,653
I'm sort of a gay hero.

419
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,455
Last year, I married
two penguins at the zoo,

420
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:27,657
and it turned out
they were both gay.

421
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,225
- Penguin wedding.
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:32,011
- That's cute.
- It was so cute.

423
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:33,262
But enough about how
cute it was.

424
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,564
Why don't you think
I should have the money?

425
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,299
Good lord, really?

426
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:37,650
Look.

427
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,868
When I was 18,

428
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:41,871
and I became mayor
of my hometown,

429
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,539
I used every last dollar we had

430
00:13:43,607 --> 00:13:45,808
to open a giant
winter sports complex.

431
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:47,076
Called it Icetown.

432
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,511
And it turned out great,
and everyone loved it.

433
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,512
Uh, yeah, kinda.

434
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,880
It was never completed,

435
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:53,082
and I got impeached.

436
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,217
Newspaper headline was,

437
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:57,553
"Icetown costs ice clown
his town crown."

438
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:58,588
Yuck.

439
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,523
They were big into rhymes.

440
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,124
Well, I don't know.

441
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,359
I think Icetown sounds great.

442
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,660
And the point is,

443
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:07,213
at least you tried something.

444
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,683
Foul!

445
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,018
Foul on number three

446
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,719
for taking a number two
on number four.

447
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,172
Roughing the passer.

448
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,691
Double dribbling.
That's a foul.

449
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,776
That's a foul for touching
the basketball.

450
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:21,944
What are you gonna do about it?

451
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:23,112
Nothing.
You fouled.

452
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,247
You can't do anything.

453
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:25,865
Okay.

454
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,066
You're ejected.
You're ejected.

455
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:30,620
Oh, what's the matter
there, Ron?

456
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:31,621
No players left?

457
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,357
Yay, Andy's team!

458
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:36,025
- Look at 'em go!
- Come on.

459
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,211
Now you're openly
cheering for the other team?

460
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,962
- Put my boys back in.
- You made me the ref.

461
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,047
Deal with it.

462
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,398
You know what?
Take this uniform off.

463
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,367
- Hey, hey.
- You don't deserve to wear it.

464
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:47,436
Ron's ejected
for molesting the ref.

465
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:48,537
Oh, yeah?
I'm ejected?

466
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:49,555
- Yes, you are.
- Tom, what are you doing?

467
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,873
I'm ejecting you.

468
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,541
You're ejected, too.
Everyone's ejected.

469
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:53,542
Oh, yeah?
She's ejected?

470
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:54,543
Yeah.

471
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:59,232
Rrrraaaagh!

472
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,284
Go ahead, go.

473
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:03,319
Well, that's a forfeit.
Andy's team wins.

474
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,487
No way!

475
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,772
We won!
Oh, man!

476
00:15:06,857 --> 00:15:08,624
Eat it!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

477
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:11,127
Andy, Andy, Andy!

478
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,246
Yeah!

479
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,498
Ah-ha-ha!
Yes!

480
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,433
I dedicate this victory
to April Ludgate.

481
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,434
It feels good.

482
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:21,037
And it feels sticky.

483
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:22,788
From the Gatorade.

484
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,540
We're barely able to function.

485
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,842
We could really use that money.

486
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,377
But you know,
I don't know if it's because

487
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,912
I'm in such a good mood,

488
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,314
or because of the charming
Ann Perkins,

489
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,215
but I am going
to seriously consider that.

490
00:15:33,283 --> 00:15:35,217
Really?
That's great.

491
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:36,218
Mission accomplished.

492
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,453
Let's boogie.

493
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:38,654
Mission accomplished?

494
00:15:38,722 --> 00:15:41,891
Uh-oh.

495
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,125
Yeah.

496
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:47,063
There's a mission, uh,
that Ann had thought of.

497
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,097
It was both of our ideas,

498
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:49,465
but it was mostly Ann's.

499
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,651
We...

500
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,653
I had mentioned to Ann
that it would be fun

501
00:15:53,737 --> 00:15:55,104
if you two went on a date.

502
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:56,205
So then...

503
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:58,958
You could, uh,
talk about the money

504
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:03,212
and then, you know,
maybe give it to me.

505
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,915
Wow.

506
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:09,986
I've just had
my first bad date.

507
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,088
Ann Perkins.

508
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,827
Not that sneaky.

509
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:28,045
April!

510
00:16:30,816 --> 00:16:31,732
April.

511
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,350
Where have you been?
Oh, my God.

512
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:35,186
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm okay.

513
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:36,353
I'm dying to see you.

514
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:39,473
I called and texted you,
like, a billion times.

515
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,926
Oh, I'm sorry.

516
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:42,960
I was in Venezuela.

517
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:44,862
Oh, really?

518
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,030
Wow.

519
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,449
Across the pond.

520
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,967
Wow.

521
00:16:50,035 --> 00:16:51,135
I thought maybe
I woulda heard from you

522
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:54,755
at least once
because of what happened.

523
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,173
Ann kissing me?
I'm so sorry about that.

524
00:16:56,241 --> 00:16:57,291
It was so stupid,

525
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,110
and it meant nothing.

526
00:16:59,177 --> 00:17:02,263
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's totally fine.

527
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:03,764
Hey.

528
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:06,517
This is my boyfriend, Eduardo.

529
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:07,885
No, it's not.

530
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:10,387
- ¿Listo para lonche?
- Si.

531
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,956
That means we're going
to lunch.

532
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:13,724
How do you say
have a great time,

533
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:14,725
don't choke on anything?

534
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,893
Bye.

535
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,565
Leslie asked me
to do her a favor,

536
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:24,568
and I love her, so I did it.

537
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:27,071
I'm sorry, and I'm here
to eat crow.

538
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:28,572
I like you a lot.

539
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,608
Let's go out again.

540
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:36,380
Ann Perkins.

541
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,799
Budget solution number 28.

542
00:17:38,884 --> 00:17:43,637
Use grazing sheep
to mow grass in parks.

543
00:17:43,722 --> 00:17:47,558
Note: Tired sheep
could become food

544
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,093
or sweaters.

545
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,997
Well, I got my answer.

546
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:54,365
About April.

547
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:55,733
She hates me.
Yeah.

548
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,801
And she got a boyfriend,
I guess,

549
00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:59,270
from some city in Mexico.

550
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:00,971
So...

551
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:03,007
What do I do?

552
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:04,241
Okay.

553
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:06,010
Well, when your back's
against the wall

554
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:09,113
and odds are stacked
against you,

555
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:10,981
you just...
you...

556
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:12,817
You swing the hardest, damn it.

557
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,168
You go big, or you go home.

558
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:16,453
And you don't seem like
the kind of guy who goes home.

559
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:17,955
I'm not.

560
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:19,089
I don't even really
have a home.

561
00:18:19,157 --> 00:18:20,591
- Go get her, Andy!
- Okay.

562
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:22,793
Okay, thanks, Leslie!

563
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:28,132
Okay, so we know the people
who run this government

564
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
have no faith in us.

565
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:30,667
My plan is gonna change that

566
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,203
and bring the budget back.

567
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,537
And the answer's been
right in front of us

568
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:34,522
the whole time.

569
00:18:34,606 --> 00:18:36,557
Ew, check your testicles?

570
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:37,608
No, not that.

571
00:18:37,676 --> 00:18:39,109
Although that is
very good advice.

572
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:40,110
I'm looking at you, Jerry.

573
00:18:40,178 --> 00:18:41,378
No, what's gonna save us

574
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:44,949
is right there.

575
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:46,550
Gentlemen, I realize
that times are tough,

576
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:48,285
and the budget is tight.

577
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:51,155
But if the people of this town
have nothing else to do

578
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:53,891
but sit in their houses
and play video games,

579
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:56,193
then Pawnee will die.

580
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,463
And we refuse
to let that happen.

581
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,582
Now.

582
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,751
This town was historically
known for two things.

583
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,971
Widespread obesity

584
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,758
and the annual
Pawnee Harvest Festival.

585
00:19:10,842 --> 00:19:12,610
People from all over Indiana
would come

586
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:13,944
and gaze in wonderment

587
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:15,512
at how fat our citizens were.

588
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,730
And while they were here,

589
00:19:16,815 --> 00:19:18,282
they would also attend
the festival.

590
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,751
A full week of corn mazes,

591
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:22,570
hayrides, ferris wheels,

592
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:24,521
pumpkins the size of jeeps.

593
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:27,558
We lost that festival
a few years ago,

594
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:29,093
due to another round
of budget cuts.

595
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,463
And I propose
we bring the festival back.

596
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,398
With ticket sales
and corporate sponsorship,

597
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:35,699
we'll earn all that money back.

598
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,034
And believe me,
people will come.

599
00:19:37,102 --> 00:19:38,535
What if they don't?

600
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:41,505
Well...

601
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:43,841
Then you eliminate
the Parks Department.

602
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:46,477
And you guys are all
on board with this.

603
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:48,112
- Aye.
- Yes.

604
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,314
Look, we're not
just pencil pushers.

605
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:53,517
We are a reflection
of the community.

606
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:57,021
And we believe that we can
strengthen that community.

607
00:19:57,088 --> 00:19:59,023
Because in the end,

608
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,725
the reason why we're all here

609
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:04,528
is to bring people together.

610
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:07,732
♪ ♪

611
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:09,075
That...

612
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:11,244
Literally...

613
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:14,514
Is the most moving thing
I've ever heard.

614
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:18,685
And a good idea.

615
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:19,686
Yeah, all right.

616
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:21,020
Excellent.

617
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,106
Great, okay, so everybody,

618
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,557
we're gonna party hard
for 15 minutes.

619
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:28,027
Then we're gonna have
our first brainstorming session.

620
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:33,656
Hello, April.

621
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:35,824
Do you like the flowers?

622
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,243
What are you doing?

623
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,061
All due respect, Eduardo.

624
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,529
You seem like a great guy.

625
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:42,264
But I like April,
and I'm coming after her

626
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:44,316
with everything I've got.

627
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,302
So do you want
to go out with me?

628
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,388
No.

629
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:50,606
I thought you were gonna
say yes,

630
00:20:50,674 --> 00:20:51,674
but that's okay.

631
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,559
Because I'll be back tomorrow
to ask you again.

632
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,461
And again the next day.

633
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:56,645
And the next day.

634
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,646
Not Friday.

635
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:58,764
I have to go visit my cousin.

636
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:00,316
But I will be back after that

637
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,801
to ask you again.

638
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,380
Ah! You should do it.

639
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:16,315
Uh, follow you dream.

640
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:18,517
Oh, my God.
Really?

641
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:19,518
That's awesome.

642
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:22,788
I'll see you tomorrow.

643
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:26,958
