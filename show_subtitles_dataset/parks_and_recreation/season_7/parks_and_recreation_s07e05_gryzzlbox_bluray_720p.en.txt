1
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:04,140
But they're just a company,
they're not that powerful.

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,543
Whoa!

3
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:09,045
"Open your door"?

4
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,214
Ah!

5
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:13,683
Oh, my God, Ben!
We're about to die.

6
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:15,285
- Good lord!
- Oh, my...

7
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,753
The robots have come for us.

8
00:00:16,787 --> 00:00:18,188
I made fun of you
when you said it would happen

9
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:19,789
but your novel has come true.

10
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:20,857
Hey, Leslie Knope!

11
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:22,559
Please enjoy this free gift,

12
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,594
courtesy of Gryzzl.

13
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:26,829
Okay,
so they also have a squadron

14
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:30,400
of flying robots giving presents
to everyone.

15
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:31,935
We're screwed.

17
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:53,957
New dish we're working on.

18
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,425
Tell me what you think.

19
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:58,394
It's a red and white heirloom
red bean pasta,

20
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,630
with an imported
Tuscan walnut herb sauce,

21
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:03,199
infused with shaved heritage
Pecorino Romano.

22
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:04,200
What?
You're done?

23
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:05,935
Mmm.
Really good.

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,903
Why are you doing new dishes?

25
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:11,641
Lucy is visiting her boyfriend
Conrad in Chicago,

26
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:13,076
so I'm just trying to distract
myself with work

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,944
so I don't think
about the marathon bone sesh

28
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:15,945
they're probably having.

29
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,913
Hey, you know what, dude?

30
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:17,947
You gotta take your mind
off of them.

31
00:01:17,982 --> 00:01:19,716
Check this out.

32
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,417
It's a contract.

33
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:23,119
It came from the station manager
where I do my show,

34
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:25,288
Johnny Karate.
He wants me to sign it,

35
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:28,291
but is says that they'll own
the character, "Johnny Karate."

36
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:30,793
And I want to own the character
Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me.

37
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:32,896
Wait, this says they only pay
you a hundred bucks a week?

38
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,565
Yeah, but all I really do
is goof around all day.

39
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,267
Write, produce,
and direct a TV show.

40
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,403
Plus, I act in it,
and I do sets, props, wardrobe.

41
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:42,238
At the end, I drive everybody
home, so I mean,

42
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:45,041
a hundred bucks a week...
that's pretty fair.

43
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:46,943
This is perfect.
I'll be your agent!

44
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:49,612
I'll put all my energy into
renegotiating your contract.

45
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:51,381
I won't even think
about Lucy and Conrad

46
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:55,051
and his stupid crunches
that he probably does.

47
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,987
I should probably do some
crunches.

48
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:59,022
Let's go!

49
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:01,758
Ow!
Andy, my tum tum!

50
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,060
Knope, I need to talk to you.

51
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:05,161
What's up?

52
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:06,930
I know I technically work
for Gryzzl,

53
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:08,832
but these fools
have crossed a line.

54
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,333
Have you gotten one of these
GryzzlBoxes?

55
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,335
Well, yeah,
but I haven't opened it yet.

56
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:15,171
Planning on sending it back
after I wrote a sternly-worded

57
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:17,874
letter about how I cannot be
bought with free gifts.

58
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,410
These are my free gifts.

59
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,245
Two honey bears...

60
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:24,848
and a canister of sugar plums.

61
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:27,483
"Honeybear" and "Sugar Plum"
are the special names

62
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:28,918
Joe and I call each other.

63
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:30,086
Aww.

64
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,388
Yeah, we're adorable,
but this is creepy.

65
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:34,057
Because we only call each other
these things

66
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,959
on the phone or in texts.

67
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:38,494
How do they even know?

68
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:41,297
Leslie, open that box
they sent you.

69
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:44,367
Ooh! Joe Biden's book,
"Biden the Rails:

70
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,603
1001 Poems
Inspired by My Travels

71
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:48,071
Through Amtrak's Northeat
Corridor."

72
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,272
A thousand?

73
00:02:49,306 --> 00:02:51,808
A poster of the Supreme Court
Justices

74
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:54,344
sipping the Friends milkshake!

75
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:55,845
This stuff is perfect for me.

76
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,414
Yeah, exactly.
They must be data-mining.

77
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,216
Searching our texts and emails

78
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,918
and gathering profiles
on all of us.

79
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:04,087
This is a huge invasion
of privacy,

80
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,588
not to mention illegal.

81
00:03:05,623 --> 00:03:07,690
When they installed their free
Wi-Fi in town,

82
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:10,660
I made sure that there was
language preventing this.

83
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:12,374
I never would have agreed
to work with them

84
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:14,564
if I had known they were gonna
be snooping in my biz.

85
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:16,533
Gryzzl is going down.

86
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,101
You wanna put me on blast?

87
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,502
I'ma put you on Front Street.

88
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:20,703
I don't understand what
that means,

89
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:23,206
but I think I get the context,
and I love it.

90
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:26,609
April, the new Parks interns
start today,

91
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:28,978
and I was wondering if you would
deliver a little welcome speech.

92
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:30,813
No, go away.

93
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:34,184
Watermelon, martinis, exposed
brick, Keri Russell's hair.

94
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:36,219
Why did you just say those
weird things?

95
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,655
On the advice of my therapist,
Dr. Richard Nygard,

96
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,924
whenever I feel like yelling,
I just take a deep breath

97
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,226
and say three great things
about being alive.

98
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,229
- Gross.
- Please talk to my interns.

99
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:48,264
Fine.
Whatever, I'll do it.

100
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,966
I started here when I was 20,

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,869
and now I'm old and gross
and directionless.

102
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:55,472
Those kids are me ten years ago,

103
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:57,941
and this internship
is the videotape from The Ring.

104
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,276
It's too late for me.
I've seen too much.

105
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,745
But maybe I can save them.

106
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,682
You're all gonna die in here!

107
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:07,116
Hello, everyone.

108
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,586
We are here today
to discuss Gryzzl,

109
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,454
and whether or not they
are invading our privacy.

110
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,489
They sent my husband
three boxes of genital cream

111
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,991
to his office.

112
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,827
My husband's splotchy genitals
are no one's business,

113
00:04:17,862 --> 00:04:21,431
except for his, mine,
and his many genital doctors.

114
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:26,502
They sent me a bunch of toy
pigs dressed like movie stars.

115
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:27,904
That's my private hobby.

116
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:31,241
No one knows I collect toy pigs
dressed like movie stars,

117
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,842
except now all of you people.

118
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:34,077
Which one is that?

119
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:36,279
This is actually
Ham-uel L. Jackson

120
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:38,581
from the movie, Pork Fiction,
it's extremely rare,

121
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:39,949
and I am keeping it.

122
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,385
But still, they no right to give
me something I will treasure

123
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,087
the rest of my life.

124
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:46,456
I opened my box
in front of all of my friends,

125
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,259
and it was a bunch
of Virginia Woolf novels.

126
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:51,728
Now Miley and Haley
know I like to read.

127
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,129
What if they tell Evan?

128
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:55,632
I like their phones,
but they've gone too far

129
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,600
sending this stuff
to our houses.

130
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:00,203
Gryzzl has no right
to search our private data.

131
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:03,973
So wait, you guys are not
against us on this?

132
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,742
We're not against you on this.

133
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:08,378
We're not against you on this.

134
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:10,246
We're not against you
on this.

135
00:05:10,281 --> 00:05:12,582
Finally, after months
of searching for a way

136
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:16,019
to defeat Gryzzl, we have found
its Achilles' heel.

137
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:18,755
The town is behind us,
Donna is on our side,

138
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:20,456
and the next domino to fall?

139
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,525
Ron Swanson.

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,162
Actually, this is Tom Sell-oink,
but, you know, close enough.

141
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:27,564
Actually,
I'm gonna need that back.

142
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:28,598
Oh, yes, of course.

143
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,542
February 2016... I think
you're gonna really enjoy

144
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:35,029
this month's photo album.

145
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:38,272
It includes such hits as:
"First Trip to the Dentist,"

146
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:39,926
"Sonia Tries Pizza,"

147
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:42,396
and "Waterpark Vomit
Chain Reaction."

148
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,097
Why would you take pictures
of that?

149
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:45,832
- Why would you not?
- As you requested,

150
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,969
here's a picture of my son
at a recent moment in his life.

151
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:51,404
So cute...

152
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,474
What are you doing?
- Protecting my son's privacy.

153
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:56,410
What, I'm just gonna carry
around pictures of my child

154
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:57,744
where anyone could see them?

155
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,713
Well, it's funny you should
mention privacy

156
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:01,381
because that's our next topic.

157
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:03,717
Ron technically works
for Gryzzl.

158
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:05,485
And when he finds out
what Gryzzl is doing,

159
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,855
he is going to lose. His. Mind.

160
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:12,526
- I have no reaction to this.
- What?

161
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,161
I do not pass judgment
on the workings

162
00:06:14,195 --> 00:06:15,562
of private businesses.

163
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:17,064
I just build their buildings.

164
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,699
And frankly,
if people are foolish enough

165
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:20,167
to carry around a doodad

166
00:06:20,201 --> 00:06:22,702
that lets Gryzzl
track their every move,

167
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:23,870
this is what they get.

168
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,639
But it's illegal.

169
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,073
I don't believe that's true.

170
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:28,208
I've spent a fair amount of time

171
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,563
with Gryzzl's high-priced
lawyers,

172
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:32,479
and they do seem to,
as they say,

173
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:34,281
"keep it 100."

174
00:06:34,315 --> 00:06:36,616
Well, those fools
still think I work for them.

175
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:38,785
So I can get you a private VIP
tour of the building.

176
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,355
Maybe you can snoop around.

177
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:43,056
Hey there, homies, I'm Roscoe.

178
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:44,558
Psyched to give you guys a tour.

179
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,993
Yes, hello,
I'm Darlene Johannsen,

180
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,096
and this is my
assistant-turned-lover,

181
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,730
Gregory Strong.

182
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:53,867
Ours is a new romance,
but one that sent shockwaves

183
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,569
through my architecture firm.

184
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:57,337
- But it feels so right.
- Steady.

185
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:01,108
We love Gryzzl, and we would
love to see how it all works.

186
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:04,311
Sweet.
Let's get loco.

187
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:07,481
Okay, so, let's get to know
each other.

188
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,182
Talk about why you're here,

189
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,617
whether you're throwing
your lives away,

190
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,285
stuff like that.

191
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,753
Uh, you, what brought you here?

192
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,055
I love the Parks department.

193
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,189
I grew up near Ramsett Park

194
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,457
and I used to go
to tons of stuff there.

195
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:18,859
Okay, that doesn't help me.

196
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:20,060
Uh, Mork?

197
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,495
Oh, it's Mike.

198
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:23,463
I love parks,
more than anything,

199
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:25,866
and I've been a summer camp
counselor since I was 13.

200
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,200
Ugh. Gross.

201
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:29,102
What about you?
Why are you here?

202
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:31,071
The only thing I love more
than parks is recreation.

203
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:32,072
Really?

204
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:33,173
No, I just needed college
credit.

205
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:34,207
What are you studying?

206
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:35,208
Nothing.
College is stupid.

207
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:36,476
Then who made you do this.

208
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:38,378
- My parents.
- What are they like?

209
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:40,533
Well, my mom's the devil
and my dad's a dumb doctor.

210
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:42,482
- Oh, my dad's a doctor.
- Shut up.

211
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:43,950
- Jen is it?
- Yeah.

212
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,285
Let's take a walk, Jen.

213
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,387
I feel like you have
almost zero potential.

214
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:48,622
I think that's cool.

215
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:49,990
And action!

216
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:53,126
We meet again,
Puppy-Hating Dan.

217
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:54,661
You stole my guitar.

218
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:56,963
And you put farts in my lunch.

219
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,533
You've really done it this time.

220
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,435
Puppy Army, attack!

221
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:02,669
Yeah!

222
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:04,171
What? No!

223
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:05,839
I hate puppies.

224
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,507
I'll admit to everything.

225
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:09,076
You win again, Macklin.

226
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,811
Another mystery solved!

227
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:14,114
We'll be right back after this
with some more Johnny Karate.

228
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:15,215
Okay, that's lunch, everyone.

229
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:16,983
We're back in 30 minutes.

230
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:18,452
Great job, bud, you crushed it!

231
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:19,920
I love being Andy's agent.

232
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:22,756
He does all the work, and I get
10% just for showing up.

233
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,825
It's like a chef
at a restaurant,

234
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:27,160
making all the food, and then
the owner gets a profit...

235
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:29,229
which is my other job!

236
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:31,598
Man, I really got things
figured out.

237
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:32,866
Let's make this quick.

238
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,235
Andy's show gets huge ratings
in three cities.

239
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,938
His GryzzlTube page
has millions of views.

240
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:39,940
If you don't Andy walking over
to your rival station

241
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:43,110
in Snerling, I think you should
start taking this seriously.

242
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:45,412
Right. Okay,
here's what we're gonna do.

243
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:47,347
I'm gonna upgrade
the parking spot.

244
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:49,483
But my son gets a role
as one of the kid ninjas.

245
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,351
All right?
He's gonna love me for it.

246
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:53,420
It's gonna drive
my ex-wife crazy.

247
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:54,888
So far, so good, but, uh,

248
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:56,162
in the words of Jerry Maguire...

249
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,758
- "The human head weighs
8 pounds."

250
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,093
No.
"Show me the money."

251
00:09:00,128 --> 00:09:02,229
Andy, do you know how lucky
you are to work here?

252
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:03,563
I'm a kingmaker.

253
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:07,901
Pep Wiley, Chuck Warschank,
Selena Gomez... I made them.

254
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:09,669
You discovered Selena Gomez?

255
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:10,971
Different Selena Gomez.

256
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:12,672
Look, I don't have the money
for a raise.

257
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:15,175
Uh, yeah you do.
I've seen profit reports.

258
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,045
The show's a bonanza.
Andy starts making 500 a week.

259
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,147
Now.

260
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:21,815
Get the hell out of my office,
both of you...

261
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:23,216
- Sit down.
- I don't...

262
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,319
Look, dude, this internship
leads nowhere.

263
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:30,123
It'll just screw up
the rest of your life.

264
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:32,125
- What do you love doing?
- Texting.

265
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,261
What did you want to be when
you were little?

266
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:37,264
A scary mermaid that lures
sailors to their death.

267
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:39,533
Okay, side note,
I'm gonna file papers

268
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:42,469
to adopt you as my child,
so keep an eye out for that.

269
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:45,539
But more importantly,
don't do this internship.

270
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:46,940
Go do something fun

271
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:49,476
like trying to control birds
with your mind

272
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,281
or posting internet comments
as Michael Jackson's ghost.

273
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:56,817
Okay.
Maybe you're right.

274
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:59,052
Thanks.

275
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:01,388
Hey, April, we finished those
questionnaires you gave us

276
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:03,090
about our hopes and dreams
for the internship.

277
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:06,526
Great!
Thanks, Mike!

278
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,131
Oh, I'm sorry this building
is so lame.

279
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,632
As soon as we get our new
headquarters built,

280
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,267
it's gonna be way, way, tighter.

281
00:10:14,302 --> 00:10:15,869
Check it.
Matty.

282
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:17,704
Okay, this is GryzzlVibe.

283
00:10:17,739 --> 00:10:19,072
It's this new app
that we're developing

284
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:20,974
that monitors your mood.
Tell them about it.

285
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:24,044
As you know, the cameras
on your phones are always on,

286
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:25,045
whether you're using them
or not.

287
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,546
I'm sorry, they are?

288
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:29,416
This app uses facial
recognition software

289
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,984
to track your expressions.

290
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,419
It's always watching.

291
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:35,255
Well, what do you do
with this information?

292
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:37,691
Well, if the camera senses
that you're in a bad mood,

293
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:40,060
then we can geo-match you to,
say, the nearest cup

294
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:41,695
of sweet pick-me-up java.

295
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:45,265
But if you're in a good mood,
then we could geo-nudge you

296
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:46,900
to, like, a sweet coffee shop.

297
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,169
Just keep the good times
rolling.

298
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:51,371
So it's really just a coffee
sales app.

299
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:52,672
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

300
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:53,807
Yeah, we're developing
with Starbucks.

301
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:54,808
Yeah.

302
00:10:54,842 --> 00:10:57,210
So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl

303
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:59,546
know all the things
that someone wants?

304
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,651
Are you guys... I don't know,
whatever... data-mining?

305
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,686
Oh, hells yeah, dog-man.

306
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:10,924
Our super rad algorithm searches
all your texts, calls, banking,

307
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,959
medical records,
blah, blah, blah,

308
00:11:12,994 --> 00:11:15,362
to learn what you really want.

309
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:17,431
You know, from snacks
to new books and movies

310
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:20,200
to when you ladies need to score
some new 'pons.

311
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:23,036
I mean, we might know you better
than you know yourself, Leslie.

312
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,172
How did you know it was me?

313
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:26,773
Oh, there's about
40 different ways.

314
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:29,743
I mean, geo-maps on your
different Gryzzl devices,

315
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:31,578
and, of course, we face-scanned
you when you came in.

316
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:32,646
Really glad you're here.

317
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,381
Okay, good.

318
00:11:34,415 --> 00:11:36,349
Just 'cause we're competing
for the Newport land

319
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:37,818
doesn't mean that we can't be
friends.

320
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:39,219
- No.
- Isn't that your motto?

321
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:40,933
"Wouldn't it be tight
if everyone was chill

322
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:41,922
to each other?"

323
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:42,923
Totes.

324
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:44,491
And I hope that you can see now

325
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,693
that there's nothing scary
about Gryzzl.

326
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:49,196
I mean, we just wanna learn
everything about everyone

327
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,470
and track them wherever they go

328
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,632
and anticipate what they're
about to do.

329
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,901
These are really interesting
issues, Roscoe.

330
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:57,771
I think maybe we could debate
them, you know?

331
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:00,374
- On TV.
- TV. Retro.

332
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:02,075
I love it.
All right.

333
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,112
I'm gonna GryzzlPad out of here.

334
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:06,146
Later, chillerz.

335
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:12,050
This is The Perdples Court,

336
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:15,120
a legal debate show
about issues facing residents

337
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:16,621
of Southern Indiana.

338
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:19,658
With your host,
Judge Perd Hapley.

339
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:21,426
Tonight, on The Perdples Court,

340
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,428
we will have the guests
that have been booked

341
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:24,863
for tonight's show...

342
00:12:24,897 --> 00:12:27,599
the plaintiff, Leslie Knope,
who has some big allegations

343
00:12:27,633 --> 00:12:28,733
against Gryzzl.

344
00:12:28,768 --> 00:12:30,802
The defendant,
Gryzzl Vice President

345
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,270
Roscoe Santangelo.

346
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:34,072
Who will win?
I don't know yet.

347
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:36,041
Which is what makes
this a court show.

348
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:38,143
We have public opinion
on our side,

349
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:40,211
and we have proof that Gryzzl
has been data-mining.

350
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:41,880
But there's one more thing
we need.

351
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:46,184
The one thing that Americans
respect more than anything else:

352
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:49,554
public humiliation
on live television.

353
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:52,524
Leslie, don't humiliate
yourself on television.

354
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:53,858
Swanson, what are you doing
here?

355
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:56,761
This is the 27th version
of the Pawnee-Gryzzl

356
00:12:56,796 --> 00:12:59,097
free wireless internet thing
agreement.

357
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,333
Check out the page I marked.

358
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,969
Yeah, "Gryzzl is not allowed
to collect and use customer data

359
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:06,438
for any purpose."
It's pretty clear. See?

360
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:10,008
Look closer, amendment "C,"
addendum 14.

361
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:14,012
It directs you to this appendix,
which reroutes you to this one

362
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:17,515
which says, in a sub-footnote:

363
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,617
It says here
they can gather and use

364
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:20,518
any information they want.

365
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:22,320
How did I miss this?

366
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:23,521
Look at the revision date.

367
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:26,291
December 18, 2015.

368
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:29,561
That was the opening day
of Star Wars: Episode VII.

369
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:31,997
You were muttering that date
in your sleep for months.

370
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,933
They knew you'd be distracted.
That's how they slipped it in.

371
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,534
I did this to the town.

372
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,303
It's my fault.

373
00:13:38,337 --> 00:13:42,574
It's Ice Town all over again.

374
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:47,112
Is Star Wars the one
with the little wizard boy?

375
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,514
Okay, this is what
I can give you.

376
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:52,717
No more janitorial duties,
better parking spot,

377
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:55,520
unlimited Mike and Ikes
from the vending machine,

378
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:57,956
and for salary,
we're at 500 a week.

379
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,424
500 whats?

380
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,959
Dollars, man.

381
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:02,427
What about the rights
to Johnny Karate?

382
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:03,728
We own the rights
to Johnny Karate

383
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:05,030
I can't bend on that one.

384
00:14:05,064 --> 00:14:06,498
But I invented the character.

385
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:07,499
Well, invent another character.

386
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:10,335
Uh, here you go:
Kung-Fu Billy.

387
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:11,770
Jeremy Punch-Guy.

388
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:13,071
Ed Kick.

389
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:15,040
Those are actually pretty great.

390
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:17,509
But Johnny Karate
is special to me.

391
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:21,513
If we can't get the rights,
I'm gonna walk.

392
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:23,415
He's making the biggest
mistake of his life.

393
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:25,116
He's walking out on Hank Muntak?

394
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:27,285
I have six Lower Great Lakes
Emmy Awards.

395
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,321
I once sat in the original
Batmobile.

396
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:32,590
James Woods follows my niece
on Twitter.

397
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,992
He's gonna regret this.

398
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:36,061
All this work,
everything I've done

399
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,296
for this city,
it's all a wash now.

400
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:39,698
Everyone's gonna hate me again.

401
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,466
Some of us are already there,
Wyatt.

402
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,736
This is not your fault.
Ron, talk some sense into him.

403
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,105
Ben's right.
This is Ice Town all over again.

404
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:48,239
- I...
- Ron!

405
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:49,507
If you're gonna sign

406
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:50,876
a legally binding document,

407
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,477
you need to read it thoroughly.

408
00:14:52,511 --> 00:14:54,212
That's why the only contract
I've ever signed

409
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:56,781
is my Mulligan's Steakhouse
club card.

410
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:59,117
And even then,
I used a fake name.

411
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:00,452
Les.

412
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,320
Les Vegetables.

413
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:03,622
Don't worry, okay?

414
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,290
You're not gonna take the fall
for this.

415
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:08,259
Ron, make sure that Donna
doesn't hurt him.

416
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:10,829
You wanted to see me?

417
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,931
Yes, can you tell me where
Jennifer is?

418
00:15:12,965 --> 00:15:14,199
I convincer her to quit.

419
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,334
Martha Stewarts apron line,

420
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:18,970
my tomato plants...
oh, God, I'm out!

421
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,238
Where is my emergency list?

422
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:22,007
Recently, I've been feeling

423
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,409
like I've wasted
the last ten years of my life,

424
00:15:24,443 --> 00:15:26,144
and it all started
with this internship,

425
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:29,147
and I don't want those kids to
make the same mistake, okay?

426
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:31,716
April, you spent the last
ten years doing amazing things

427
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,151
with this Parks department,
and learning

428
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:34,886
from the greatest teacher
in this or any business,

429
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:36,688
Leslie Freaking Knope!

430
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:38,323
You'd be a checkout girl
at a gas station

431
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:40,659
if it wasn't for that
internship.

432
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:44,829
Sweet potato pie, unlikely
animal friend pairings,

433
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:47,198
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

434
00:15:47,233 --> 00:15:48,800
You're lucky to have worked
here,

435
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,102
no matter what you want to do
with the rest of your life.

436
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:53,271
And I think you know that.

437
00:15:53,306 --> 00:15:58,343
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go find a new intern.

438
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:00,745
Now Leslie, I understand
that what you've brought

439
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,981
to the show
isn't a box of objects

440
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:05,817
but rather a symbolic box
of allegations.

441
00:16:05,851 --> 00:16:09,154
- Well, Perd...
- It's "Judge Perd."

442
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,990
Okay, uh, I think there are
certain questions

443
00:16:12,024 --> 00:16:17,429
about certain aspects of certain
parts of this situation

444
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:22,534
that require an evaluation
about whether or not

445
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:25,503
this is or is not a valid
argument.

446
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:27,239
Extremely well-put.

447
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:28,940
Excuse me, Judge Perd?

448
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:30,742
I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager.

449
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:33,578
What Gryzzl is doing with our
private information

450
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:38,516
may not technically be illegal,
but it's definitely not chill.

451
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:41,119
Whoa! That's a serious
allegaysh, homie.

452
00:16:41,153 --> 00:16:42,320
We are hella chill.

453
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:44,756
And frankly,
if you don't like our vibe,

454
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,124
you don't have to use our shizz.

455
00:16:46,158 --> 00:16:48,059
Well, we kind of do.

456
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,995
I mean, the internet
is no longer optional,

457
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,464
it's a necessity for everyone.

458
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:55,634
And I think you do know
that data-mining isn't chill,

459
00:16:55,668 --> 00:16:58,770
because you snuck it
into the 27th update

460
00:16:58,804 --> 00:17:02,741
of a 500-page user agreement.

461
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:06,211
A person should not have to have
an advanced law degree

462
00:17:06,245 --> 00:17:08,046
to avoid being taken
advantage of

463
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,782
by a multibillion dollar
company.

464
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:13,985
You should be upfront
about what you're doing

465
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,889
and allow people the ability
to opt out.

466
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:22,627
To be honest, Judge Perd
is stumped by this case.

467
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:25,597
I've also misplaced
my judge hammer.

468
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:27,165
I cannot render a verdict here.

469
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,535
Therefore, I must declare
a mistrial, which is a term

470
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:33,038
I've heard people use
in the movies.

471
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:35,373
Tap, tap, tap.
Case ended.

472
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:37,108
And we're clear.

473
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,227
All right, later, dudes.

474
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:44,229
Hey, good news!
I think I found a job.

475
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:45,230
There was an opening

476
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,230
for a janitor at the TV station.

477
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,933
Get this... they're gonna pay me
the minimum wage.

478
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,735
Put your mop down, bud.

479
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,103
I got you the rights
to Johnny Karate.

480
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,804
No way!
How?

481
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:54,817
Just a great agent I guess.

482
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:56,553
Please, man, please!

483
00:17:56,587 --> 00:17:58,821
Andy's my friend,
and I want to do a good job,

484
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:00,323
and there's this girl
I really like,

485
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:03,426
and she lives in Chicago,
and she's still dating someone,

486
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,928
- and I just feel like...
- Oh, God.

487
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,496
Do you want to eat
at my restaurant for free?

488
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,464
Every week, you could come once
a week, and it's free.

489
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:10,967
Okay, okay, fine.
J-just stop!

490
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:13,136
See?

491
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,504
I told you it was gonna
work out.

492
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:15,872
That's actually really good
advice for anything.

493
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:18,675
If there's something
that you want badly,

494
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:21,544
you just have to believe
that it's gonna work out.

495
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:28,117
Hey, I am sorry that I screwed
up your life.

496
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:31,521
I found a bunch of new potential
interns to replace Jen.

497
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:32,589
Hi.

498
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:33,790
How'd you manage that?

499
00:18:33,824 --> 00:18:35,992
I just thought,
"What would Leslie do?"

500
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:39,662
So I handed out flyers
and I canvassed the college.

501
00:18:39,697 --> 00:18:41,464
I even baked a bunch of cookies.

502
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:44,567
It was weird, I actually enjoyed
finding them.

503
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,136
And I enjoyed bullying Jen
into quitting.

504
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:49,091
Hmm. You should add
"telling people what to do"

505
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:50,840
to your "perfect job"
description.

506
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:52,141
Good idea.

507
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:53,910
You should up your therapy
to seven times a week,

508
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,679
stop dressing that way,
and give me your wallet.

509
00:18:56,714 --> 00:19:00,483
Victor Garber, James Garner,
Jennifer Garner.

510
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:02,185
I go alphabetical now.

511
00:19:03,387 --> 00:19:05,355
Hey, you're back!
How was the trip?

512
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:07,991
It was okay.
Kind of weird.

513
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:09,525
Oh. Weird couple of days
for me too.

514
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,128
Closed a bunch of deals,
did a bunch of crunches...

515
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:14,697
Yeah, I broke up with Conrad.

516
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:18,234
Which was a long time coming,
but still weird.

517
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:21,004
So yeah, uh,
do you want to talk about it?

518
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,673
Thanks. I don't think I'm
ready to discuss it just yet.

519
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:26,309
But what I would like to do
is have a glass of wine

520
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:27,877
and talk about that shade
Nicki Minaj

521
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:29,846
threw at Jesse Eisenberg
at the BAFTA awards.

522
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,915
- Mm. He deserved it.
- No. he didn't!

523
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:33,316
Uh, settle in,

524
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,919
because I have some very strong
feelings about this.

525
00:19:37,454 --> 00:19:39,455
They're all down.

526
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,558
Thank God.
Sometimes I think they're

527
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:43,426
somehow the first humans
who don't need sleep.

528
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,728
Look, this Gryzzl thing,
it's complicated.

529
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:48,197
But this isn't Ice Town.

530
00:19:48,232 --> 00:19:49,832
You have done so much
for this town,

531
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,901
and people know that.

532
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:53,369
I'm just sorry we couldn't
find something

533
00:19:53,404 --> 00:19:54,871
illegal on Gryzzl.

534
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:56,639
If we're gonna stop them,
and you're gonna beat them

535
00:19:56,674 --> 00:19:59,542
on the Newport land,
we need more ammo.

536
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:07,016
We need to talk.

537
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,251
What is that?

538
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:11,020
This is a flying robot
I just shot out of the sky

539
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:13,356
after it delivered a package
to my house.

540
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,159
I thought you didn't like
to pass judgment on business...

541
00:20:16,193 --> 00:20:19,062
- The package was addressed
to my son,

542
00:20:19,096 --> 00:20:20,997
who is four years old,

543
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,800
and does not own
a Gryzzl doodad.

544
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,313
Somehow the robots looked
at Diane's computer

545
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,167
and learned something about my child

546
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,899
and then brought him a box of presents,

547
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:31,999
so I destroyed the robot.

548
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,632
No one is safe from these bastards.

549
00:20:35,023 --> 00:20:36,660
Tell me what to do, Leslie.

550
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:39,623
I wanna help you take them down.

551
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:43,491
