1
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:17,084
Which brings us to 2005...

2
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,685
The Circle Park renovation was complete,

3
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,686
and a young man
named Thomas Haverford

4
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:24,855
was still two years away
from getting hired.

5
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:27,791
Perhaps we could skip ahead
and just hit the highlights?

6
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:30,160
I mean, I planned
a comprehensive retrospective,

7
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:32,329
but I guess I can just focus
on the really important moments.

8
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:35,532
Ah! The debate about getting
a pod-based coffee machine.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,368
Garry and I wrote a little
musical number about that,

10
00:00:38,436 --> 00:00:40,938
and it goes a little something
like thi...

11
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,405
Can't we just quickly
shake hands,

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,574
pretend we like each other,

13
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:45,121
- and get out of here?
- I'm all for that.

14
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:47,611
No, April, Ron,
we need to celebrate everything

15
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,146
that we've done together
as a group.

16
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:50,747
This is our last day here!

17
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:53,817
Who knows when we'll all be
together like this again?

18
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:55,252
Excuse me.
Hi.

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,653
There's a swing in a park

20
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,022
near my house that's been broken
for about three months.

21
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,791
Is it possible
to get that fixed?

22
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:04,695
Anything is possible
if you follow your dreams.

23
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:05,863
Johnny Karate.

24
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,665
Except getting a swing fixed.

25
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:09,262
None of us
actually work here anymore.

26
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:11,185
Come back in two hours
when the office is open.

27
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:13,320
- Thank you.
- Wait.

28
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:15,890
Actually, sir, we can help.

29
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:19,226
We can and we will because
when we used to work here,

30
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:21,028
helping people was our job.

31
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:22,429
Forget about these old stories.

32
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:23,631
Let's make a new one.

33
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:25,266
Let's fix a swing.

34
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,934
One last ride
for the Parks and Rec gang.

35
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:28,002
Who's in?

36
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:29,170
Yeah.

37
00:01:29,237 --> 00:01:31,205
♪ The vote
was four to three ♪

38
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:33,007
♪ Donna said to get rid of me

39
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:34,475
♪ But Ron was suspicious

40
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:36,610
♪ 'Cause my coffee
was delicious ♪

41
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:38,629
Come on, Garry,
you're the mayor now.

42
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:41,198
Have some dignity.

43
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,809
Sync by Alice | Thank you honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

44
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,538
Okay, so what
is our first step

45
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,273
on our quest to help this man?

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,674
Does anyone remember?

47
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:09,177
A parks and recreation
equipment requisition form.

48
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:11,045
Correct.
Five points for Hufflepuff.

49
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:12,613
Well,
everything's paperless now,

50
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:15,450
and none of us has a log-in,
so can't access the computers.

51
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:16,851
Hang on.

52
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,787
I have one right here,
thanks to Leslie's scrapbook,

53
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:22,223
"Thanks Form the Memories!"

54
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,559
Oh, I knew those scrapbooks
were gonna come in handy.

55
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:27,862
You came through
like you always do.

56
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,130
God, I'm gonna miss you.

57
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,549
Your confidence,
your joie de vivre,

58
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,818
that crazy story about you
getting kicked out of En Vogue.

59
00:02:33,886 --> 00:02:36,120
Technically I kicked them out.

60
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,388
When do you leave for Seattle?

61
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,123
As soon as I get
my local real estate license.

62
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,292
I'm married to a teacher,
and I love the man,

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,695
but I also love diamond watches.

64
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,196
Well, whatever happens,

65
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:49,701
I know you are gonna live
an exciting and full life.

66
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:57,759
3,400 square feet,
a beautiful view of Puget Sound,

67
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,107
and if you look out this window,

68
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:01,530
you can watch them build
the new Space Haystack

69
00:03:01,597 --> 00:03:02,831
around the Space Needle.

70
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:03,999
Wow.

71
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,767
I-I can hardly see
the needle anymore.

72
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:07,115
I know.
It's kind of the point.

73
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,539
So what are we thinking?

74
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:11,940
Wow.

75
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,909
It sold in two hours?

76
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,178
You cannot beat
the Seattle real estate market.

77
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,176
I think it's all that coffee
and legal marijuana

78
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,832
has people wanting to buy houses
quickly and irrationally.

79
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,934
Mm.

80
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,535
But the giant commission check

81
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,205
has me thinking
about Donna-Joe Adventure Quest.

82
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,041
Ooh, where are we going?

83
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,709
Well, it can't beat last year.

84
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,878
I mean, Middle Korea,
so beautiful.

85
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,229
Here's my idea.

86
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,631
- The Amazon.
- Oh.

87
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:38,033
Three weeks of the best
and most expensive places

88
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,035
South America has to offer.

89
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,170
I love it.

90
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:42,871
Honestly, with the way
work is going,

91
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,573
I just need this right now.

92
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,711
The school cut the math club
and math.

93
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,713
They just don't teach math
anymore.

94
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,349
Aw, my poor little
do-gooder teacher baby.

95
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,035
Why don't we cuddle up
on the couch, watch a movie,

96
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,871
and then maybe later
I'll wear that little red thing?

97
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,339
Yes.
The red thing.

98
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,475
Here, let me get this.

99
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,348
Call Satan's niece.

100
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,584
Hey, what do you want?

101
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,987
And this is me DJ-ing
a boat party in Venezuela,

102
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,989
kind of reminded me of the
two weeks you and I spent there.

103
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,257
Oh, yeah, that happened.

104
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,259
- Yeah, it did.
- April.

105
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,627
What are you doing here?

106
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,129
- Babe, have a seat.
- What's going on?

107
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,398
Recently I was thinking
for the millionth time

108
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,033
how lucky
I am to have found you,

109
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,538
so I've decided
to treat yo' self.

110
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,325
You're gonna buy me
a bunch of leather handbags?

111
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,377
Donna is going
to take some of the money

112
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,012
you usually use on your trips

113
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,713
and establish
an education program

114
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,315
through the foundation
I work for.

115
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,617
It's called "Teach Yo' Self,"
and you and the other teachers

116
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,552
will get money
for after-school programs,

117
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,956
for music, art, math,
whatever you want.

118
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:54,660
Baby, this is really generous,
but I love our trips,

119
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,929
and honestly it's your money.

120
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,431
You should spend it
how you want.

121
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,732
This is what I want.

122
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,567
I've had a lot of adventures.

123
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,604
I single-handedly started
that doorknockers earring trend.

124
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,572
I came in ninth
in Italy's Got Talent.

125
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,908
- Yeah.
- I served on a NASCAR pit crew.

126
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:13,580
I want a new kind of adventure,
and I want to take it with you.

127
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:18,401
Okay, I feel like it's time
for me to get out of here.

128
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,070
What is this mess?

129
00:05:21,138 --> 00:05:22,639
Why are you all in my office?

130
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:25,441
We are on one last mission
to help the people of Pawnee.

131
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:27,944
Craig, can you sign
the requisition form?

132
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:29,245
It'd speed things up.

133
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:31,233
You know, Craig,
when I first met you, I thought,

134
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,016
"There's a man
who loves his job."

135
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,919
And then I thought,
"Oh, wow, he's intense."

136
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,555
And then I thought,
"Oh, no, he's insane.

137
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:40,913
That person is psychotic,
and I need to call the police."

138
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:43,109
Yeah, that's usually the way
it goes.

139
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,179
But I just think
you've come so far,

140
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:48,315
and I'm so glad
that we are leaving

141
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:51,252
the Parks Department
in your hands.

142
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,655
♪ Funny, though it's true

143
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:59,225
♪ Those silly things you do

144
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:04,197
♪ They only bring me closer

145
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:08,868
♪ To you

146
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,073
Nice crooning, buddy.

147
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:15,976
The gentleman
over by the bar there

148
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:17,477
sent you over
this glass of wine

149
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,846
and his business card.

150
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:24,851
Okay, so as you all know,
Tom's Bistro...

151
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,421
Okay, fine.

152
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,340
We are gathered here today

153
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:32,810
to join Craig Middlebrooks
and Typhoon Montalban

154
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:34,144
in holy matrimony.

155
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:36,080
I don't know about this.
I'm very scared.

156
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:37,848
Oh, just relax,
you nervous Nelly.

157
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,916
You're right.

158
00:06:38,917 --> 00:06:40,317
We love each other,

159
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:42,720
and the tax break
is substantial.

160
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:45,589
Will the best man
please present the rings?

161
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,725
Good luck, you two.

162
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:55,432
Typhoon, my love,
happy anniversary.

163
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,001
Do you have any regrets?

164
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,370
Not one.
Not a single one.

165
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:00,637
Do you have any regrets?

166
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,573
Are you kidding?
Thousands.

167
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,775
Most recently this trout!

168
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:09,480
Okay, April and Andy,
I need to file this.

169
00:07:09,547 --> 00:07:12,049
Would anyone like to accompany
me to the fourth floor?

170
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:13,717
One last journey
to the weirdest place on earth?

171
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:14,818
- Yes.
- Shotgun!

172
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:16,153
We... we're just taking
the elevator.

173
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,661
I get to push buttons.
I called it.

174
00:07:17,722 --> 00:07:18,856
Oh...

175
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:20,483
- He called it.
- Yeah, I know, I heard.

176
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:26,677
Ethel Beavers,
we need this filed, please.

177
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,546
We've gone digital.

178
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,515
Get with the times,
you Luddite.

179
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,266
Man,
of all the places in Pawnee,

180
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:34,068
I'm gonna miss the fourth floor
the most.

181
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:38,106
The disturbing murals,
the ominous lighting...

182
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,340
the creepy people.

183
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,475
Hi, April.

184
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:42,377
I'm gonna miss the food
in Pawnee.

185
00:07:42,444 --> 00:07:45,246
Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut,

186
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,448
and most of all,
I'm gonna miss you, Leslie.

187
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:49,484
Aw, Andy,
all of those things,

188
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:53,154
including me, will still
be with you in Washington.

189
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,689
That is a beautiful sentiment.

190
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,658
It... I just want to say

191
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,794
that we are about to embark
on an amazing adventure,

192
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,763
and whatever happens,

193
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,799
just know that Ben and I
are always there for you.

194
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,839
Agent Macklin, I need you.

195
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,307
Some thieves
are trying to steal

196
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,042
the legendary
Snakehole Sapphire.

197
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,011
What the...
No!

198
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,612
That sapphire has the power
to activate

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,214
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

200
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:22,217
Damn it, Macklin!
I love it when you take charge.

201
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:25,020
Make love to me, you fool,
you animal!

202
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,558
Okay, rain-check that,
all right?

203
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:30,994
They're here.

204
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,095
Trick or treat!

205
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:35,231
Oh!
Look at them!

206
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:36,966
Here you go,
you little monsters.

207
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,134
I love this.
You guys are the best.

208
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:41,237
My love, we have to go.

209
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,472
Just put all the candy in a bowl
or something.

210
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,074
What's wrong?

211
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:46,976
- Did you eat all the candy?
- No.

212
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:48,043
- Did you?
- Yes.

213
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,278
But that's not what's wrong.

214
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:53,215
It's just, seeing all those kids
out there...

215
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,785
Babe...

216
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,220
I want to put a babe
in you, babe.

217
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,356
Andy, you know
where I stand on this.

218
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:02,825
Yes, I would love
all the awesome stuff

219
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:03,926
my body would go through.

220
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:05,862
I mean,
if all it meant was puking

221
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:08,798
and getting weird stretch marks
and veins everywhere,

222
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:10,166
then sign me up.

223
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:13,202
But at the end, we've brought
a child into the world.

224
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,704
- That's disgusting.
- No.

225
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:15,938
They wipe all
of the disgusting stuff

226
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,608
off of it immediately.

227
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:19,709
We're gonna be late
for dinner.

228
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:22,012
- Okay.
- Let's go.

229
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,646
- Hey.
- Come on in.

230
00:09:23,714 --> 00:09:26,216
Hey, always nice to see
Janet Snakehole

231
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:28,184
and Burt Macklin in the mix.

232
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:29,412
What are you guys dressed as?

233
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:32,823
Oh, I'm Sandra Dee O'Connor.
Get it?

234
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,292
Sandra Dee
plus Sandra Day O'Connor?

235
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,527
- Who's Sandra Dee?
- Who's Sandra Day O'Connor?

236
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:38,929
Forget it.

237
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,698
And I am the Lamplighter,

238
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:44,067
a character
from my new board game sequel,

239
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:47,037
"Cones of Dunshire:
Winds of Tremorrah."

240
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:51,608
Gameplay Magazine called it
"punishingly intricate."

241
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,110
Hey, where are the kids at?

242
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,878
I want to say hi and wrestle
all three of them at once.

243
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:57,481
Oh, they're trick-or-treating
in Georgetown with some friends.

244
00:09:57,548 --> 00:10:00,617
It's just us grown-ups tonight,
no kids at all.

245
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:09,694
Hey, Andy, why don't you
give me a hand in the kitchen?

246
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:13,096
So what do you need
a hand with?

247
00:10:13,164 --> 00:10:16,533
Oh, no, I just thought
you might want to talk.

248
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,603
Whoa.
Dude, that's really slick.

249
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:23,207
Oh, man, that's some
secret agent stuff right there.

250
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:25,643
So April's still
on the fence about kids, huh?

251
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,945
Yeah,
and I'm freaking out, man.

252
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,780
I want kids so bad.

253
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:31,715
You know,
yesterday I was at the park,

254
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:33,703
and I saw this group
of eight-year-olds laughing,

255
00:10:33,752 --> 00:10:35,653
playing, having a good time.

256
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,788
I almost started crying.

257
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:39,256
Granted, I'd just face-planted
on my rollerblades.

258
00:10:39,324 --> 00:10:40,724
That's what
they were laughing at.

259
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,693
Sure.

260
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:45,095
- All right, go ahead.
- What?

261
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,303
You're gonna lecture me about
how Andy and I should have kids.

262
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:48,699
You're gonna be like,
"They're so great.

263
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,902
"They change your life,
and yes, they drive you nuts,

264
00:10:50,969 --> 00:10:53,304
"but it's all worth it
for the beauty and the majesty

265
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:55,172
"and the glory of their little
faces in the morning.

266
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,507
Blah, blah, blah, and barf."

267
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:57,842
You know why it's so unfair?

268
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,377
Because you guys got so lucky.

269
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:01,579
You had sex one time,
and you had three kids,

270
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:04,682
and they're all, like,
smart and great and healthy,

271
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,084
and now your lives are perfect.

272
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,585
But our life
is pretty perfect already.

273
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:10,088
And you know what, kids act
the opposite of their parents.

274
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:11,489
That's why your kids
are so cool.

275
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:12,837
But Andy and I are cool already,

276
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,859
so our kids will be,
like, really lame and weird.

277
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,995
I'm sorry.
I just don't know what to do.

278
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,764
Please tell me what to do.
What do I do?

279
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:22,166
It's not about trying
to make your life perfect.

280
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:24,836
Nobody's lives are perfect.

281
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:29,107
You have kids
because you and Andy are a team

282
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:31,109
and you want to bring in
some new team members.

283
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:33,044
So you think we should?

284
00:11:33,112 --> 00:11:34,552
I don't know
if you should have kids.

285
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:35,914
I really don't.

286
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:38,651
But I do like your team.

287
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:42,988
All right, Ms. Ludgate,
we're getting close.

288
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:44,656
Babe, you look
more beautiful right now

289
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,191
than I have ever seen you.

290
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,592
Wow.

291
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,395
Just your luck that you're going
into labor on Halloween.

292
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:52,831
Can I get a warm towel
to get that makeup off?

293
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:55,534
No! I want it on!
That's the whole point.

294
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,769
I put the makeup on
after I went into labor.

295
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:59,404
Whatever blows your skirt up.

296
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:01,773
Okay, you ready to push?

297
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,342
Wait, no.
Babe, my birth mix.

298
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,545
♪ He did the mash

299
00:12:06,612 --> 00:12:08,580
Here comes a contraction.
Are you ready?

300
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:10,248
Okay, I'm ready.
Let's do this.

301
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:12,684
♪ It was a graveyard smash
♪ He did the mash

302
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:14,486
♪ It caught on in a flash

303
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,221
♪ He did the mash

304
00:12:16,289 --> 00:12:18,056
♪ He did the monster mash

305
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:21,560
♪ From my laboratory
in the castle east ♪

306
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:23,428
Burt Macklin Junior?

307
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:25,464
Mm, we need a Halloween angle.

308
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:30,135
How about...
Demon Spawn Baby Satan Dwyer?

309
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:31,670
Oh, I like that.
Yeah.

310
00:12:31,737 --> 00:12:33,705
Or maybe

311
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:39,244
Burt Snakehole Ludgate
Karate Dracula Macklin

312
00:12:39,312 --> 00:12:40,579
Demon Jack-o-Lantern Dwyer?

313
00:12:40,646 --> 00:12:42,314
We call him "Jack"
for short.

314
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:43,682
Hey. Hi.

315
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,950
Oh, I want to scream,

316
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,285
but I don't want
to wake up my godchild.

317
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:47,586
I'm assuming
it's my godchild, right?

318
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,414
- We can talk about it later.
- Congrats, guys.

319
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:51,190
I know it came
unexpectedly early,

320
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,558
but pretty cool he was born
in Pawnee.

321
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:53,926
Where do I put these?

322
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:55,628
I have so many presents,
it's weird.

323
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:59,465
Yes!
Oh, for the baby?

324
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,667
Just put them over there.

325
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,869
- What's his name?
- Jack.

326
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:06,906
Oh, that's good.

327
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,575
Welcome to the team,
little guy.

328
00:13:14,781 --> 00:13:16,682
Take this down to maintenance.

329
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,150
I know just where to take it,
Ethel,

330
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,286
and I know just the person
who should accompany me.

331
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:21,721
I'm a little busy right now.

332
00:13:21,788 --> 00:13:23,155
Not you, Kyle.

333
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:25,024
How many times
did you and I

334
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:27,893
deliver a form to maintenance
just like this?

335
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:30,129
Oh, so many great conversations,

336
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:32,398
bonding and mentoring moments.

337
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:36,903
It seems only right that we make
this journey one final time.

338
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:38,972
- What was that, boo-boo?
- Nothing.

339
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,640
Oh!

340
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,077
Tommy-T and Sexy Lexy Knope.

341
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:46,346
Ooh, what are
you two bad larrys up to?

342
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,181
Well, this is our last day
in Pawnee,

343
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:50,350
and we have one last problem
to fix.

344
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,951
Hold up.
You're leaving?

345
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,086
For truth?

346
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:55,822
I am gonna miss you so much.

347
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:57,457
What's going on?
You're not injured?

348
00:13:57,524 --> 00:13:59,125
Uh, yeah, I'm injured.

349
00:13:59,193 --> 00:14:00,293
I got a terminal case of

350
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,829
"Get me to the front of the line
at Six Flags"!

351
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:04,931
Shaaa-boosh!

352
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,400
It's a winter wonderland.

353
00:14:07,468 --> 00:14:10,303
I'm gonna be so sad
to see you go.

354
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:13,573
Will you do me
one final kindness?

355
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:17,243
Will you pretend to be my wife
for an insurance scam,

356
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:20,213
but then we
fall in love for real?

357
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:21,921
Also, can I have a pair
of your gym socks?

358
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,429
No, wait,
it's not for anything weird.

359
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:25,085
It's just a fetish I have.

360
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:26,753
- Jean-Ralphio...
- Yeah.

361
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:30,123
Although I truly hope
that I never see you again,

362
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:35,361
I do wish you
a long and happy life.

363
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:39,199
Today, we say good-bye
to Jean-Ralphio Saperstein.

364
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,935
As per his last will
and testament,

365
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:44,337
we will now listen
to his favorite song,

366
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:48,241

Okay, they bought it.
They bought it.

373
00:15:01,188 --> 00:15:02,455
- Do you have the insurance money?
- No doubt.

374
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:03,923
No doubt.
Let's hit it, bro.

375
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:06,259

Jean-Ralphio?

381
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:18,271
- Go! Tajikistan is off!
- Go, go, go, go!

382
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,241
Tajikistan is off!
Tajikistan is off!

383
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:24,878
So... Tom and I
have a swing to fix.

384
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:27,247
Let's go.

385
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:31,551
Leslie,
I've always loved you.

386
00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:33,620
I know.

387
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,593
Oh, man!

388
00:15:39,661 --> 00:15:41,541
I forgot that maintenance
was closed on Fridays.

389
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:43,063
What would
our last ride be

390
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,365
without one more
bureaucratic snafu?

391
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:48,235
Don't worry, boo-boo, Tommy will
solve this problem no sweat.

392
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:51,338
Can I just say, Tom,
you have accomplished so much.

393
00:15:51,405 --> 00:15:54,140
You have come so far.
Now you're so successful.

394
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,809
- Don't forget well-dressed.
- Yes.

395
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:56,977
And well-dressed.

396
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,546
I am so very proud of you.

397
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:01,181
Thanks, Leslie.

398
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:02,816
I'm proud of me too.

399
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,117
Nice crooning, buddy.

400
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:06,753
Uh, the gentleman
by the bar there

401
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:08,255
sent you over
this glass of wine...

402
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,493
and his business card.

403
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,296
Okay, so as you all know,
Tom's Bistro

404
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:18,932
has been presented with
a huge expansion opportunity.

405
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,333
I don't want to make a decision
until I hear

406
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:22,002
from my senior advisory board.

407
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:23,737
So is this a good idea?

408
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:26,473
- Accounting Nerd?
- I'm a congressman, Tom.

409
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,908
Can you at least call me "Ben"?

410
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,376
No can do, Accounting Nerd.

411
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:30,978
We all knew you
before you were a big shot.

412
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:32,512
Let's keep the whining
to a minimum.

413
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,681
Well, there are always
gonna be risks

414
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:37,484
when you open new restaurants,
but you've done your homework.

415
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,320
All the numbers line up.

416
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:40,788
Side note:

417
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:44,858
I would again strongly recommend
adding calzones to the menu.

418
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:47,261
Ugh. The worst.
Ron?

419
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:49,463
It's a bold,
capitalistic gambit, son,

420
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,366
but nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

421
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:53,200
Regal Meagle?

422
00:16:53,268 --> 00:16:54,702
Real estate is pretty cheap
right now.

423
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,304
If you're gonna do it,
this is a good time.

424
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:59,273
Okay, I'm doing it.

425
00:16:59,341 --> 00:17:00,574
Over the next five years,

426
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:03,744
there's gonna be
20 Tom's Bistros across America.

427
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:06,580
Look out, world,
Tommy's about to blow up.

428
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:09,183
And blow up he did,

429
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:10,951
but not in the good way.

430
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:12,720
He lost everything.

431
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:16,624
Today, Tom Haverford
is broke, destitute,

432
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:19,093
and worst of all, swaggerless.

433
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:20,861
Tommy,
you got to stop watching this.

434
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:22,697
I can't tear myself away.

435
00:17:22,764 --> 00:17:24,031
It's a whole documentary
about my failures.

436
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,200
That you made.

437
00:17:26,268 --> 00:17:27,769
I had to.

438
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:30,638
I have to remember every tiny,
awful aspect of this.

439
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:32,106
I lost everything, Lucy...

440
00:17:32,174 --> 00:17:33,808
The franchises,
most of my money.

441
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,743
I had to sell
my pocket square collection.

442
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,912
What are people's eyes
gonna be drawn to?

443
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,747
Look, you had a tough break.

444
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:42,583
The stock market tanked,
credit dried up.

445
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:43,584
Who could have predicted
that the country

446
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:44,652
would run out of beef?

447
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,454
You just got to move on.

448
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:47,602
That's the problem, though.

449
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:48,856
I've gone bust in the past,

450
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:50,558
but it was because
I did something reckless.

451
00:17:50,626 --> 00:17:52,227
This time
I was smart and careful,

452
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:53,361
and I still went broke.

453
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:55,130
What do I do now?

454
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,631
Well,
you and I are gonna be fine,

455
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,367
and you'll come up
with a new idea.

456
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:02,303
You always do.

457
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:04,639
I once started
an entertainment company.

458
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,841
It failed in four months.

459
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,877
I opened
a clothing rental store.

460
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:11,613
I built a restaurant empire.

461
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,181
They all failed,

462
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:17,185
but the story of America isn't
about second or third chances.

463
00:18:17,253 --> 00:18:23,191
It's about 4th, 5th,
6th, 20th, 50th chances.

464
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,727
That's how long it took me
to get where I am today:

465
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:27,729
Best-selling author of...

466
00:18:27,797 --> 00:18:30,999
Failure:
An American Success Story.

467
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:40,175
As you know
if you've read the book,

468
00:18:40,243 --> 00:18:44,379
I've outlined seven different
types of successful people.

469
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:50,085
You can be an Andy,
an April,

470
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:53,755
a Ben, a Leslie,

471
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,893
a Ron, a Donna,

472
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:00,729
or my personal favorite, a Tom.

473
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:03,765
But what do we definitely
not want to be?

474
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,267
A Garry!

475
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:07,669
That's right.
Do not be a Garry.

476
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:10,973
Oh, he's talking about me!

477
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,841
Hey.

478
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:15,177
Hey, thanks so much
for coming, guys.

479
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:16,245
Are you kidding?

480
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:17,813
Tom, this is incredible.

481
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,215
A best-selling book,
a 40-city tour?

482
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,650
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you.

483
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:23,419
Well, the book's
called Failure.

484
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:25,254
- I don't know how to take that.
- I'm serious.

485
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:27,256
You guys
have always supported me.

486
00:19:27,324 --> 00:19:29,491
Here, I inscribed you a copy.

487
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,026
Oh.

488
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:33,362
"When I think of success,
I think of you.

489
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,397
"You are a true inspiration
to me.

490
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,900
I love you,
Tom Haverford."

491
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,869
Oh, sorry, that's actually
for Kendrick Lamar.

492
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:42,805
Here's yours.

493
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:45,607
"Best wishes."

494
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,176
And I mean every word of it.

495
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:53,115
So how are we gonna
fix this swing?

496
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:54,550
Hold a public forum,

497
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:57,353
have a rally, smash that door,
and do some looting?

498
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,622
Actually, I think
there's a simpler solution.

499
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,760
We just need the help of
the most powerful man in Pawnee.

500
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:06,929
Jim, how the heck are you?
Yeah, look.

501
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,198
I hate to bother you, but I'm
here with my two best friends,

502
00:20:09,266 --> 00:20:10,900
Leslie Knope
and Tom Haverford...

503
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,535
Shh!

504
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,370
And we need the first floor
maintenance room open.

505
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:17,206
Mm. Okay, great, and best
to Louise and the girls.

506
00:20:17,274 --> 00:20:18,775
Okay, bye-bye.

507
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,977
- You guys are all set.
- Thank you, Mayor Gergich.

508
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,378
You really saved our butts.

509
00:20:22,446 --> 00:20:24,247
I am so happy
that you get to be mayor.

510
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:25,448
Are you enjoying yourself?

511
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,616
Oh, are you kidding me?

512
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,851
Leslie, I know
that this is purely ceremonial,

513
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,639
and it'll be over
in just a couple of weeks,

514
00:20:30,654 --> 00:20:32,488
but I just don't know
how my life

515
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:33,856
could get any better than this.

516
00:20:33,924 --> 00:20:36,559
Oh!

517
00:20:36,627 --> 00:20:39,562
In a turn of events
both shocking and unexpected,

518
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,199
interim mayor Garry Gergich
was officially elected today,

519
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,535
thanks to a massive
write-in campaign.

520
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:47,504
Mayor Gergich,
what are your plans

521
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:48,938
for your first actual term?

522
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,206
Oh, jeez, you know what?

523
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:51,608
I have no idea, Perd.

524
00:20:51,675 --> 00:20:53,543
I mean, this is so crazy.

525
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:54,911
I just hope I do a good job,

526
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:57,313
and I promise
I'm gonna try my best.

527
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,750
And faithfully serve the people
of Pawnee, Indiana.

528
00:21:00,818 --> 00:21:05,021
As president of City Council,
I, Councilwoman Brandi Maxxxx,

529
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:09,359
star of more than 11,000 adult
films in the last two years,

530
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:13,963
officially declare Garry Gergich
Mayor of Pawnee, Indiana,

531
00:21:14,031 --> 00:21:15,165
for the fourth time.

532
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,233
Thank you, Pawnee!

533
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:18,601
Okay, great.

534
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:20,370
Garry Gergich,
you are now mayor,

535
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:23,973
again, for the tenth time,
proving conclusively

536
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,342
that in these corporate states
of America,

537
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,512
it's the entrenched powers
who hold all the cards.

538
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,548
Thank you,
Councilman Morris.

539
00:21:31,615 --> 00:21:33,616
Thank you, Pawnee!

540
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:37,954
Happy birthday,
my sweet, sweet husband.

541
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:40,457
We all love you so much.

542
00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:43,593
I have had the perfect life.

543
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:45,929
I have had
the perfect marriage...

544
00:21:45,997 --> 00:21:48,365
- Oh!
- The perfect children,

545
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,836
and the perfect grandchildren
and great-grandchildren!

546
00:21:52,904 --> 00:21:56,573
And I just want you to know
how much I love you.

547
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:59,776
Okay, come on, everybody,
say, "Gergich!"

548
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:03,680
Gergich!

549
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:07,584
Mayor Garry Gergich
died peacefully in his sleep

550
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:09,586
on his 100th birthday,

551
00:22:09,654 --> 00:22:13,523
holding the hand
of his beloved wife, Gayle.

552
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:16,793
Man, Gayle looks amazing.

553
00:22:16,861 --> 00:22:18,195
Yeah, yeah.
I know.

554
00:22:18,262 --> 00:22:19,496
He will now be given

555
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:23,433
the Indiana Notary Society's
highest honor,

556
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,168
the 21-Stamp Salute.

557
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,146
Oh, rest in peace, friend.

558
00:22:36,214 --> 00:22:39,449
They spelled his name wrong
on the tombstone.

559
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:45,088
- Eh, close enough.
- Eh.

560
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,057
It's time to go.

561
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:52,284
Okay.
How's this for a headline?

562
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:55,487
"Still Swinging: Parks Gang
Reunites for One Last Bang."

563
00:22:55,555 --> 00:22:56,955
That's a little dirty.

564
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:59,124
Well, it's a headline, Shauna.
Sex sells.

565
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:00,425
Knope,

566
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:03,495
make yourself useful and hand me
that crescent wrench.

567
00:23:03,563 --> 00:23:07,165
Oh,
not bad craftsmanship, Ron.

568
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:09,135
It is perfect craftsmanship.

569
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:13,873
I calculate the cost
of my labor at $38.

570
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:17,409
I can send the bill to you?

571
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:19,711
So you think you're
gonna stick around Pawnee?

572
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:21,480
Oh, I imagine so.

573
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:23,882
Not sure where
I would go, really.

574
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,885
Well, we're gonna
come back here a lot.

575
00:23:26,953 --> 00:23:28,889
You know what they say.

576
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:32,192
Don't be a stranger.

577
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,661
Despite the recent
financial crisis,

578
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:39,598
Very Good Building Company
will finish fiscal year 2022

579
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,535
in excellent financial shape,
thanks in large part

580
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:45,371
to the stewardship
of your chairman, Ron Swanson.

581
00:23:45,438 --> 00:23:48,207
Mr. Chairman, would you like
to say a few words?

582
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:55,314
I resign as chairman,
effective immediately.

583
00:23:55,382 --> 00:23:58,284
Uh, would you
like to explain why?

584
00:23:58,351 --> 00:23:59,818
No.

585
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:02,221
Should we discuss
your retirement package?

586
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:04,456
Just give me whatever
the board thinks is fair.

587
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:07,426
- Agreed.
- Best of luck.

588
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:10,062
Don't get emotional, Vaughn.
You're embarrassing yourself.

589
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,600
What just happened?

590
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:20,239
Ron, your family is beautiful.

591
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:22,175
They're a handsome bunch.

592
00:24:22,242 --> 00:24:25,678
Diane and I are especially proud
because Ivy was just accepted

593
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:26,746
at Stanford University.

594
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:27,914
Wow.

595
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:29,215
Yeah, it's gonna cost
an arm and a leg.

596
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:30,550
You take my advice?

597
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:32,051
I did.
Thank you, again.

598
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,453
I sold some of my gold

599
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,523
and officially diversified
my portfolio.

600
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,058
Congratulations.

601
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,660
You now own 51%
of the Lagavulin Distillery.

602
00:24:40,728 --> 00:24:42,088
Pleasure doing business
with you.

603
00:24:42,096 --> 00:24:43,196
And with you.

604
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,766
Sláinte.

605
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:49,404
So, Ron,
what brings you here?

606
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,907
I am at something
of a personal crossroads.

607
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:56,510
Yes!
I love personal crossroads.

608
00:24:56,577 --> 00:25:00,514
I once made the mistake of not
talking to you at such a moment,

609
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:03,617
and I do not intend
to repeat that error.

610
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:05,085
Well, let's take a walk.

611
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:07,922
There's a cute,
little park nearby.

612
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,525
I suppose I had simply

613
00:25:11,592 --> 00:25:13,460
accomplished everything
I wanted to,

614
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:16,563
and there seemed to be
little point in continuing.

615
00:25:16,631 --> 00:25:19,399
So what do you want to do now?

616
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,134
Well, that's the problem.

617
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:22,669
I'm not sure.

618
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:24,638
My kids are growing up.

619
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:27,541
My days in an office
feel like a waste.

620
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:32,579
I would like to turn
my attention to something...

621
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:35,649
that would make me feel useful,

622
00:25:35,717 --> 00:25:40,354
but for the life of me,
I cannot figure out what.

623
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:44,024
And there are not many people...

624
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:46,594
I mean, we were workplace
proximity acquaintances

625
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:49,029
for many years,
and so I thought...

626
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:50,164
I thought maybe...

627
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:52,766
Say no more, you big softie.

628
00:25:52,834 --> 00:25:54,835
I'm gonna spend
every waking moment

629
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,938
trying to figure this out
for you.

630
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:58,939
You want to stay for dinner?

631
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,474
- We're having steak.
- Mm?

632
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:02,142
But we're also hosting
several members

633
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,145
of the House Subcommittee
on Foreign Affairs.

634
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:06,581
I'll take that steak to go,
please and thank you.

635
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:15,857
Hey, there you are.
Thanks for meeting me here.

636
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:16,924
Well, if you'd have
held them here

637
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,126
instead of that conference room,

638
00:26:18,193 --> 00:26:19,927
I would have come
to more meetings.

639
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,298
I got to tell you, Leslie,
establishing this national park

640
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:27,068
right next to Pawnee
is quite an accomplishment.

641
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:29,370
This is a fine piece of land
you saved.

642
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:31,272
Thank you, Ron.

643
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,608
You want to run it?

644
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,144
The superintendent
of Bryce Canyon retired,

645
00:26:36,211 --> 00:26:38,146
and I convinced
the superintendent of this park

646
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:40,281
to transfer,
shuffled a few things around.

647
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,517
The point is someone needs
to take care of this place now.

648
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,452
Thought it should be you.

649
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,121
I...

650
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,756
Well, first of all,
I would be working

651
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,124
for the federal government.

652
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,560
Your job would be
to walk around the land alone,

653
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:54,529
you'd live in the same town
you've always lived in,

654
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:55,897
you'd work outside,
you'd talk to bears.

655
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,165
Next argument?

656
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:59,501
There must be dozens of people
gunning for this job.

657
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:01,870
I wouldn't want you
to ruffle any feathers.

658
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,104
Am I even qualified?

659
00:27:03,172 --> 00:27:04,773
Well, a few people
might be annoyed,

660
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,874
but they'll get over it.

661
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,675
And as far
as your qualifications,

662
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:09,145
you're Ron Swanson.

663
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,215
Stop being a dummy and accept.

664
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:15,550
- When do I start?
- Oh, today.

665
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:16,818
I already accepted for you.

666
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,254
I still remember
how to forge your signature.

667
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:20,824
Let's go meet your staff.

668
00:27:23,092 --> 00:27:24,926
Pawnee National Park rangers,

669
00:27:24,994 --> 00:27:28,931
this is Ron Swanson, your new
superintendent and boss.

670
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:34,803
Rangers, my name
is Ronald Ulysses Swanson.

671
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:38,740
Your job and mine
is to walk this land

672
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:40,976
and make sure no one harms it.

673
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:43,845
If you show up on time,
speak honestly,

674
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,547
and treat everyone
with fairness,

675
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:48,283
we will get along just fine.

676
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:49,818
Though hopefully not too fine,

677
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:52,320
as I'm not looking
for any new friends.

678
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:53,889
End of speech.

679
00:27:53,956 --> 00:27:55,357
Well said.

680
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:01,163
Thank you, Leslie.

681
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,432
You're welcome, Ron.

682
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:09,538
Okay.

683
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,240
Time to go to work.

684
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,144
♪ Laugh with me, buddy

685
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:19,681
♪ Jest with me, buddy

686
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:24,586
♪ Don't let her get the best
of me, buddy ♪

687
00:28:24,654 --> 00:28:27,723
♪ Don't ever let me start

688
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,092
♪ Feeling lonely

689
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,261
♪

690
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,901
Well, I have to make
a couple more adjustments.

691
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,673
Babe,
I don't want to seem dramatic,

692
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:46,608
but I've just reconsidered
every decision

693
00:28:46,676 --> 00:28:47,943
that we've made
over the last year,

694
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:50,145
and I think we need
to stay in Pawnee forever.

695
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:51,580
I know.

696
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:52,814
But we have to pick up
the kids,

697
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:53,982
and we have a flight to catch.

698
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,517
But when is this group
of people

699
00:28:55,585 --> 00:28:57,686
ever going to be
all together again?

700
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,288
That's all I want,

701
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:01,990
all of these people in
the same place at the same time.

702
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:03,959
It'll happen someday.

703
00:29:04,027 --> 00:29:05,627
What's gonna happen
between now and then?

704
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:09,531
A lot,
and it's all gonna be great.

705
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,466
- You promise?
- I promise.

706
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:19,942
This is a nice house.

707
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,044
You say that every time
we're here.

708
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:23,245
I'm just trying
to distract you,

709
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:25,314
so you don't have
a nervous breakdown.

710
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:27,149
I think I am past that point.

711
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:28,417
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

712
00:29:28,485 --> 00:29:30,286
Hey, folks, welcome back.

713
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,521
Great to have so many
good friends and colleagues.

714
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:35,257
We're looking forward to a great
conversation and a good dinner.

715
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:38,994
As usual, there's only
one rule: No shop talk.

716
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:40,763
So if you want
to discuss politics,

717
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,765
you're gonna have to wait
until after dinner.

718
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:44,333
I'm looking at you, Leslie.

719
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:47,536
Okay, well, as long as we get
to play charades later.

720
00:29:47,604 --> 00:29:49,471
Okay.

721
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:52,708
Last time we played charades,
she spent 31/2 hours here.

722
00:29:52,776 --> 00:29:54,096
You're just mad
'cause you lost.

723
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,844
Oh, come on.

724
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:03,590
Damn!
That food was good.

725
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:05,258
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again...

726
00:30:05,326 --> 00:30:08,028
Joe Biden knows his way
around a seafood risotto.

727
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:09,863
You've said that before?

728
00:30:09,931 --> 00:30:13,066
Anyway, the point is, yes,
I do like working at Interior.

729
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:15,635
I love it, but I'm always
looking for new challenges.

730
00:30:15,703 --> 00:30:16,970
Why do you ask?

731
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:19,106
There's a rumor
the governor of Indiana

732
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:22,075
isn't going to run again,
and my friends at the DNC

733
00:30:22,143 --> 00:30:25,312
are very interested in you
as a candidate.

734
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,748
- For governor of Indiana?
- Mm-hmm.

735
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:29,975
Someone's been reading
my kindergarten dream journal.

736
00:30:29,984 --> 00:30:31,285
So what do you think?

737
00:30:31,352 --> 00:30:32,819
I'll call you next week,
and we can talk about it?

738
00:30:32,887 --> 00:30:35,289
O-okay, great.

739
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:37,090
Well, this is exciting.

740
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:38,592
I'm gonna take this energy,

741
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,594
and I'm gonna go crush Joe Biden
in charades.

742
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:43,065
Dr. Jill, let's pick teams.

743
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,934
Oh.
Move.

744
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:49,269
Need the congressman.
This is time-sensitive.

745
00:30:49,337 --> 00:30:51,305
Hey, Jen,
I didn't know you were here.

746
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:52,406
I'm everywhere.

747
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:54,341
You want to be
governor of Indiana?

748
00:30:54,909 --> 00:30:55,809
What?

749
00:30:55,877 --> 00:30:57,311
Colquitt's not gonna
run again.

750
00:30:57,379 --> 00:30:59,079
It's a rumor for now,
but my gut says it's for real.

751
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:00,547
You're the perfect candidate.

752
00:31:00,615 --> 00:31:02,716
Local hero,
state government experience,

753
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:04,318
blah-blah-blah-
blah-blah-blah-blah.

754
00:31:04,386 --> 00:31:05,753
I mean,
the only potential problem

755
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,355
is that devastatingly nerdy
"Cones of Dunshire" thing.

756
00:31:08,423 --> 00:31:10,257
Uh, that's a problem?

757
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:11,592
I'm sorry,

758
00:31:11,659 --> 00:31:13,761
but it's the ninth-highest
selling multiplayer

759
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:18,599
figurine-based strategy
fantasy sequel game in history.

760
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,268
Please don't bail on me
because of what just happened.

761
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:24,705
So...

762
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:26,173
I had a pretty interesting
conversation

763
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:27,521
with Janet from the DNC tonight.

764
00:31:27,576 --> 00:31:28,709
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

765
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:30,578
She said
that Governor Colquitt

766
00:31:30,645 --> 00:31:32,379
might be stepping down,

767
00:31:32,447 --> 00:31:35,816
and the DNC thinks
that I should run for governor.

768
00:31:35,884 --> 00:31:40,354
Oh, God.
That... kind of sucks.

769
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:41,689
Really? Why?

770
00:31:41,757 --> 00:31:43,524
No. I mean, that's...

771
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:44,759
That's amazing.

772
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:49,063
It's just, Jen Barkley kind of
approached me about running.

773
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:51,433
Oh!
Oh.

774
00:31:52,501 --> 00:31:55,336
Well, I mean, obviously...

775
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,606
Right.
Yeah, no, no.

776
00:31:58,674 --> 00:31:59,707
I mean, obviously...

777
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:01,576
Yeah, I mean, obviously...

778
00:32:04,947 --> 00:32:07,182
Okay, pros of you
running for governor:

779
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:09,083
You would be a great governor,

780
00:32:09,151 --> 00:32:10,718
we could make Pawnee
our home base,

781
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:12,320
kids could go to school
in Pawnee,

782
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,589
and it would be
a huge career move for you.

783
00:32:14,657 --> 00:32:17,825
The pros of me running
for governor are the same thing.

784
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:19,327
- It's the same list.
- Right.

785
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,329
The only con of you running
would be

786
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,565
that I don't get to run
and vice versa.

787
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:27,335
Good.
So we've solved it.

788
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,237
Ugh.
Look.

789
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:30,745
We're going back
to Pawnee in a week.

790
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:32,641
Why don't we just
talk about it after that?

791
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,009
Good idea.

792
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:35,810
Hey, maybe we can drop by
the old stomping ground,

793
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:37,979
see how the Parks Department
has changed.

794
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,047
I love it.

795
00:32:39,115 --> 00:32:40,749
Okay, are you ready?

796
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:43,018
No, but we don't have
a choice, do we?

797
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:46,021
Kids, dinner!

798
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,288
Hey, I'm gonna eat in my room
because I have to study.

799
00:32:48,324 --> 00:32:49,324
Can we go to Bobby's house
to watch the game?

800
00:32:49,392 --> 00:32:50,625
Hey, dude, stop.

801
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:51,860
- Did you finish your homework?
- Yes, all of it.

802
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,161
- Okay, don't forget to...
- That's mine.

803
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:54,362
- We'll be back by 8:00.
- Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom.

804
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,830
- Bye.
- Okay, get your ice skates!

805
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:56,998
- You have a lesson tomorrow!
- Bye, Mom.

806
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,300
- Bye, Dad.
- Just-okay.

807
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,970
Bye.

808
00:33:02,238 --> 00:33:04,806
- Want some broccoli?
- Ugh, no.

809
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:07,409
You know, now that I'm here,

810
00:33:07,477 --> 00:33:10,278
it's giving me an idea
about this governor thing.

811
00:33:10,346 --> 00:33:12,447
Maybe we need fresh eyes,
you know,

812
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:13,915
other people to weigh in.

813
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:18,820
We should talk to Ron or Tom
or April or Donna or Andy even.

814
00:33:18,888 --> 00:33:20,956
- Sometimes he can be wise.
- Oh, good idea.

815
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:22,624
Let's call them.

816
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:24,259
Or you know what else
we could do?

817
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:25,894
Just talk to them in person.

818
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,764
Hey!

819
00:33:28,831 --> 00:33:31,466
Surprise!

820
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:33,035
Oh, wow.

821
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:34,222
It's what you wanted, right,

822
00:33:34,237 --> 00:33:36,705
everyone in the same room
at same time?

823
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:39,041
I can't believe you.

824
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:42,544
We're all here together
in the same room...

825
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:45,647
in this room.

826
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:48,283
I don't think
I could be happier right now.

827
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,351
Want to bet?

828
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:51,620
- Hi.
- Oh, Ann's here!

829
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:53,488
Ann.
Ann's here!

830
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:54,890
- Hi!
- Oh!

831
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:56,091
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

832
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,793
- How you doing?
- Oh, good.

833
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,728
- You guys, Ann's here.
- Aww.

834
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:01,196
- Should we move away from here?
- Yeah, yeah.

835
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:03,865
- This could go on for some time.
- Ohh!

836
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:09,593
Your hair looks amazing,
by the way.

837
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:11,194
You look like
a cartoon princess.

838
00:34:11,262 --> 00:34:13,430
Oh, thank you! That's from the pills
I was telling you about.

839
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:14,665
I took some of those,

840
00:34:14,732 --> 00:34:15,899
but I don't know,
they didn't do anything,

841
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,301
and they kind of upset
my stomach.

842
00:34:17,368 --> 00:34:18,735
No, no, no.
You're supposed to crack them

843
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:20,838
and leave them on your hair
overnight, not eat them.

844
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:22,373
Oh, no.

845
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,009
Well, it's confusing
'cause they're delicious.

846
00:34:25,076 --> 00:34:27,278
Because my first book
was such a smash,

847
00:34:27,345 --> 00:34:29,385
I had to come up with
a new angle for the follow-up.

848
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:32,416
Then it hit me...
Failure 2.0: Failing to Fail.

849
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:34,151
- Love it.
- How's everything?

850
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,259
You properly treating yourself
out there in Seattle?

851
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:37,388
In a manner of speaking.

852
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:39,223
Joe and I spend most of our time
on the foundation.

853
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,983
I can't believe
you went nonprofit.

854
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:42,994
I mean, I love you.

855
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:44,395
You're one of my best friends,

856
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:46,564
but you have betrayed me
and everything we stand for.

857
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:48,366
- You've changed.
- Maybe you're right.

858
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,468
By the way, what time is it?

859
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:53,004
Oh, it looks like
it's half past spla-Dow!

860
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:54,305
What?

861
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:55,606
I take it all back.

862
00:34:55,674 --> 00:34:56,874
That's a lot of diamonds.

863
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:58,662
Give me, give me, give me,
give me, give me!

864
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:01,412
Hey, Oliver.
Hey, Leslie.

865
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,181
- Hello, Ann.
- Hi, April.

866
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:05,383
Your kids are,
like, surprisingly awesome.

867
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:06,451
Thank you.

868
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,685
Did you use an egg donor

869
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:10,121
or give Chris a hall pass
for a night?

870
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:12,690
Once again,
they are my biological children.

871
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:14,826
Once again,
I don't believe you.

872
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:18,463
Ann, you rainbow-infused
space unicorn.

873
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:22,033
Ann, you beautiful,
sassy mannequin come to life.

874
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:24,436
Ann, you opalescent tree shark.

875
00:35:24,504 --> 00:35:26,905
Leslie, you are the master
of the metaphor.

876
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:28,306
Oh.

877
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:30,742
I recently compared her
to a nutrient-rich chia seed.

878
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:31,977
What's that thing
on your wrist?

879
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:33,545
Oh!

880
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:38,183
You are extremely healthy.

881
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:40,952
I do that literally
50 times a day.

882
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,189
Aren't you afraid that thing
might give you cancer?

883
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:45,824
Well, I am now.

884
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:47,826
Well, there he is.

885
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:50,662
Chip Traeger,
you old son of a gun.

886
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,197
Andy, it's Chris.

887
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:54,366
Is it?

888
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:55,801
Ha! Huh.

889
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,004
Hello, Jack.
Ron Swanson.

890
00:35:59,072 --> 00:36:00,339
Strong handshake.

891
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,207
- Well done, you two.
- Thank you.

892
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:03,942
So are you
gonna have another one?

893
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,044
Um...

894
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,949
- Shh.
- Shh.

895
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:13,685
'Cause...
'cause he's sleeping?

896
00:36:13,753 --> 00:36:15,220
How can you tell?

897
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:16,722
Oh,
it's a common misconception

898
00:36:16,789 --> 00:36:18,557
that the Oculus
holds all of the power.

899
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:19,892
It's actually the Lamplighter.

900
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,693
Ann! Oh, my God!
It's happening.

901
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:24,390
It's totally happening.
Our kids are falling in love.

902
00:36:24,397 --> 00:36:25,798
This is good.
Okay, remember.

903
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:28,100
If this is ever gonna work, we
have to pretend to disapprove.

904
00:36:28,168 --> 00:36:30,069
Yeah, right, good call.

905
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:31,537
Hey!

906
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:32,905
- Leslie, no.
- Oh.

907
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:35,608
Who cares?

908
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:38,444
Ann Arbor, Michigan,
is literally the greatest city

909
00:36:38,511 --> 00:36:40,346
that I have ever lived in,

910
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:42,781
but Pawnee is better,
so we're moving back.

911
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:44,016
- That's great.
- Yeah.

912
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:46,085
I'm gonna run admissions
at Indiana.

913
00:36:46,152 --> 00:36:47,820
I'm trading Wolverines
for Hoosiers.

914
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:50,323
Well, you're getting
the better end of that deal.

915
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:52,391
Tom!

916
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:55,461
I took the quiz in your book
about what kind of person I am.

917
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:56,662
I'm a "Ron."

918
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,431
Ha!
I'm usually a "Tom,"

919
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:00,266
but sometimes I'm a "Donna."

920
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:02,335
Last time I took it,
I was a "Tom."

921
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:05,171
What?
No.

922
00:37:05,238 --> 00:37:06,372
No, no, no!

923
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,907
Take it again!

924
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:10,176
I got to go recalibrate
the quiz.

925
00:37:14,763 --> 00:37:18,100
♪ Things I really want to do

926
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:20,735
So did anyone
have any insights

927
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,404
on our "running for governor"
situation?

928
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:24,392
I've been so busy
catching up with everyone,

929
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,800
I haven't had a chance
to ask them.

930
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,309
- Yeah, me neither.
- Okay, here's what I think.

931
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:29,010
I hate
when we're on opposite sides.

932
00:37:29,078 --> 00:37:30,745
It stinks.

933
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,081
Plus, if one of us runs,
it doesn't mean we're gonna win.

934
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:35,684
Right, and it's not like
this is the only career option

935
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:36,885
for either of us.

936
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:39,120
So all that matters
is that we are good.

937
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:42,057
Right,
which is why I have an idea.

938
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:44,592
I think we should flip a coin.
I mean it.

939
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,896
Let's literally flip a coin,
because whoever runs

940
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:50,665
is gonna do a great job,
and whoever doesn't run

941
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:53,268
is gonna be right alongside
the other one,

942
00:37:53,336 --> 00:37:56,004
offering advice and support
and whatever they need.

943
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:57,238
So it doesn't matter.

944
00:37:57,306 --> 00:37:58,707
So let's flip a coin.

945
00:37:58,774 --> 00:38:00,675
Okay, you, Leslie Knope,

946
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:05,080
the queen of planning and
binders and pro-and-con lists,

947
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:08,416
you want to leave this
to chance?

948
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:14,122
Yes, because whatever's next,
you and I are in it together.

949
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,591
So let's go tell everybody,
and they can participate,

950
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:18,426
and they can sign the coin,
and then, you know, the coin

951
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:21,198
will eventually make its way
into the Smithsonian.

952
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:25,050
Okay, everybody, gather around.

953
00:38:25,118 --> 00:38:27,819
First of all, I just have to say
that all of you in the same room

954
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,488
at the same time
with your children here,

955
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:30,889
it's like
it's the greatest thing

956
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:32,797
that's ever happened
in the history of America.

957
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:35,294
And secondly,
Ben and I have an announcement.

958
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:37,663
Leslie's running
for governor of Indiana.

959
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,532
What?

960
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,934
Bully for you, Knope.

961
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:43,102
That's amazing.

962
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:44,803
Yeah, she got approached
by the DNC,

963
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:46,972
and they think she has
a great shot to win.

964
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,808
Indiana native,
supremely qualified,

965
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:52,478
and she wrote
that she wanted to be governor

966
00:38:52,545 --> 00:38:55,314
in her kindergarten
dream journal.

967
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:58,083
Just makes sense.

968
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,488
So I'm running for governor.

969
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,190
Yeah!

970
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:05,958
Ben is gonna be
running my campaign

971
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:07,393
because he's a super genius,

972
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:10,429
and he's got a tight,
compact, little body

973
00:39:10,497 --> 00:39:13,432
like an Italian sports car.

974
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,701
But right now I'd like
to make a toast.

975
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:19,105
When we worked here together,

976
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:22,808
we fought, scratched,
and clawed

977
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:25,678
to make people's lives
a tiny bit better.

978
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:28,347
That's what public service
is all about...

979
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:31,083
Small, incremental change
every day.

980
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:33,419
Teddy Roosevelt once said,

981
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:36,555
"Far and away, the best prize
that life has to offer

982
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:40,359
is a chance to work hard
at work worth doing."

983
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:44,764
And I would add
that what makes work worth doing

984
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:47,467
is getting to do it
with people that you love.

985
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:50,002
I started my career
more than 30 years ago

986
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,471
in the Parks and Recreation
Department

987
00:39:51,538 --> 00:39:53,973
right here in Pawnee, Indiana.

988
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,209
I've had a lot
of different jobs

989
00:39:56,276 --> 00:39:58,578
including two terms
as your governor,

990
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:02,815
and soon a new,
unknown challenge awaits me,

991
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:07,086
which to me, even now,
is thrilling

992
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,387
because I love the work.

993
00:40:08,455 --> 00:40:11,023
Not to say that public service
isn't sexy,

994
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:13,226
because it definitely is,

995
00:40:13,294 --> 00:40:16,229
but that's not why we do it.

996
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:17,964
We do it
because we get the chance

997
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:21,701
to work hard
at work worth doing...

998
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:25,038
alongside a team of people
we love.

999
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:30,176
So I thank those people
who've walked with me,

1000
00:40:30,244 --> 00:40:33,179
and I thank you for this honor.

1001
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:35,648
Now, go find your team,
and get to work.

1002
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:44,224
In addition to Governor
Knope's honorary doctorate

1003
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,059
from the School
of Public Policy,

1004
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:49,729
in recognition of all she's done
for the people of Indiana,

1005
00:40:49,797 --> 00:40:53,967
the campus library
will henceforth bear her name.

1006
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,739
[under breath]
A [bleep] library?

1007
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,545
Yeah, that should do it.
The swing is fixed.

1008
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:08,048
- Yeah!
- All right.

1009
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:10,216
Well, there you have it, sir.

1010
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:12,586
Another problem solved
by the hard work

1011
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:15,188
of dedicated public servants.

1012
00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:17,290
Okay, great.

1013
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:18,892
Bye.

1014
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,027
Yeah, that's about right.

1015
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,096
Okay, well...

1016
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,232
Hang on.

1017
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,500
Gayle made me promise

1018
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,569
to get a quick picture
just for old times' sake.

1019
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,773
Good idea.
Garry had a good idea.

1020
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,207
Oh, the lighting's all wrong.

1021
00:41:34,275 --> 00:41:35,595
I'm gonna
send you a glamour shot.

1022
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,843
Just Photoshop me in later.

1023
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,412
I'm not gonna show up
in that picture anyway

1024
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:39,813
because I'm a vampire.

1025
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:42,081
Hey, babe, for this picture,
should I be Burt Macklin,

1026
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:44,518
Johnny Karate,
or my new character,

1027
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,187
Sergeant Thunderfist, MD?

1028
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,522
Where did you get that?

1029
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,709
I found it in the sandbox.

1030
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,891
Ew!

1031
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,192
Go Macklin.

1032
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,161
- Macklin's the hottest.
- Get on with it.

1033
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:56,363
I can't hold this smile forever.
I look ridiculous.

1034
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:58,376
Okay, hang on.
Okay.

1035
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:03,083
You ready, babe?

1036
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:05,820
Yes.

1037
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:08,916
