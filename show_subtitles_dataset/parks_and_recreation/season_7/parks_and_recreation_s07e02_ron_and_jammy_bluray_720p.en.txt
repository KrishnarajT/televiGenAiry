1
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,769
Knopey, my girl, what up?

2
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:31,604
- I just farted.
- Oh, Jeremy.

3
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:33,172
I truly thought that
I would never have

4
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:34,207
to interact with you again.

5
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:35,374
I missed you too.

6
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,843
The city council is voting

7
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:37,810
on whether to rezone

8
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,779
the Newport land
for commercial use.

9
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:43,071
If I win, stupid Gryzzl
and stupid Ron

10
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,540
can't build anything there,
and then I'm sitting pretty.

11
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:50,245
Sadly, the deciding vote
is from my old city council mate

12
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:55,049
and human equivalent of
gas station Sushi, Jeremy Jamm.

13
00:00:55,084 --> 00:00:58,119
So I am here to talk to you
about why you should vote "No"

14
00:00:58,153 --> 00:00:59,520
- in the zoning issue...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:00,855
Hold up, little chica.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,525
Before we go any further,
I need to ask my girlfriend

17
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:04,626
how she wants me to vote.

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,095
Why?
Who's your girlfriend?

19
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,964
Hello, Leslie.

20
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:11,032
Tammy!

21
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:24,003
Sync & corrections by honeybunny

22
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:34,122
Wow, Jamm and Tammy.
Jammy.

23
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:35,824
Jammy.

24
00:01:35,858 --> 00:01:37,625
You guys are so cute.
When did you...

25
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,262
why would either one of you,
uh, you know, why?

26
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,397
Dear God, why?

27
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,566
Hit it off at karaoke.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,035
She saw me nail
Gangsta's Paradise.

29
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:48,970
I saw her bite the door guy...

30
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,873
She then let me buy her
a bunch of purses,

31
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:54,042
- and the rest is history.
- A bunch.

32
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,743
Wait a second,
this is great news,

33
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:57,979
because Ron is my opponent
in this,

34
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:00,114
and you live to torture Ron.

35
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,116
Vote for me

36
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,684
so that you can screw Ron over.

37
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:04,752
Maybe you're not
a blonde bimbo after all.

38
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:06,821
- Thank you.
- Well, let me mull it over.

39
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:09,190
Sure, I'm aligning myself
with terrible people,

40
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:11,759
but think
of all the wonderful people

41
00:02:11,794 --> 00:02:13,795
who will benefit
from a national park!

42
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,331
It's worth it,
and you can trust my opinion

43
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,533
because I have a lot to gain
by being right,

44
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,669
and I have severe tunnel vision
about achieving my goals.

45
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:25,006
Joan, on behalf of the entire
city, congratulations.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,675
I do want to apologize for not
being able to accommodate

47
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,977
- some of your requests.
- Oh.

48
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:31,145
For example,
we couldn't get a bottle

49
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,082
of Chateau Marmont
because it's a hotel

50
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:36,217
in Los Angeles, not a wine.

51
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:38,720
Well, did you at least get
buddy holly to sing?

52
00:02:38,754 --> 00:02:43,057
No, because he's been
famously dead for 60 years.

53
00:02:43,092 --> 00:02:44,692
- What?
- Hi, Joan.

54
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:46,995
Hi, my name is April,
and I'm your biggest fan,

55
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:48,129
- and I pretty much hate everyone.
- Oh.

56
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:49,998
Will you sign
your ninth memoir for me?

57
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:52,267
Well, it would be my pleasure.

58
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:53,568
You said your name was Glenn?

59
00:02:53,602 --> 00:02:56,604
- Yes, I did.
- That's pretty.

60
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,606
Joan has always been
kind of a train wreck,

61
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,943
but the last three years,
she's gone off the deep end.

62
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:04,245
She did a string of shows
from rehab.

63
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,482
Victoria Herzog,
you were a successful attorney

64
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:08,449
from Wilmington, Delaware.

65
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:09,951
Then you hit rock bottom.

66
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:11,653
This is supposed to be
anonymous.

67
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:14,255
She once gave every member
in her audience a car.

68
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,891
One car, that they all
had to fight for.

69
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:18,626
Oh, and last year she did a show

70
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:20,262
where she called
all of her ex-boyfriends

71
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:21,796
while sitting
on a washing machine.

72
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:23,565
Well, Erik,
if you didn't give it to me,

73
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,866
then who did?

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,768
I love her so much.

75
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:29,537
I hope she's my real mom.

76
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:31,773
"Entrepreneur-bachelor
Tom Haverford

77
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:34,609
"is making quite a splash
in the culinary world.

78
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:38,780
We expect even bigger things
from him in 2018."

79
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:41,850
Tom, what does "culinary" mean?

80
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,318
Means this is a cause
for celebration.

81
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,386
Round of drinks for everyone
on the house.

82
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:46,454
Yeah!

83
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:47,889
Oh, let me also get
a chicken parm

84
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:48,990
and a lasagna on the side.

85
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:51,493
And a spaghetti to go.
On the house!

86
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,895
Yes.

87
00:03:55,164 --> 00:03:56,364
That's the fourth engagement
this month.

88
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:58,733
I'm tired of being
an entrepreneur/bachelor.

89
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,702
I need to find someone.

90
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:02,837
Are you bummed, Tom?

91
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,339
Hey, I got a quick fix for that.

92
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:06,241
Let's get hammered.

93
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,409
Everything here is free.

94
00:04:08,444 --> 00:04:10,578
Ron.

95
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:14,649
Ms. Knope.
How's that $0 bid coming along?

96
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,885
You know, in my experience
with capitalism,

97
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,254
people normally expect money
in exchange

98
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:20,722
for their goods and land.

99
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:24,125
In my experience
with buttfaces, you are one.

100
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:27,762
We will now hear arguments
about the Newport property.

101
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:31,099
First, on behalf of Gryzzl,
Mr. Ron Swanson.

102
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:32,901
Thank you, councilman.

103
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:36,137
When you vote tomorrow,
we believe you should vote

104
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:38,940
to rezone the land
for commercial use.

105
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:41,976
Well, I'm convinced.
Tomorrow I'm voting for Gryzzl.

106
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:43,144
What?

107
00:04:43,179 --> 00:04:45,113
I didn't even get a chance
to say my plan.

108
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:46,915
Your plan?

109
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:48,283
You know who else had a plan?

110
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:49,450
Please don't say Hitler.

111
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:51,920
Adolf Hitler.

112
00:04:51,954 --> 00:04:53,388
I'm with Swanson.

113
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,623
It's a stache thing.
Stache bros.

114
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:57,258
You wouldn't understand.

115
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,627
We're done here.

116
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:01,996
Well, that was easy.

117
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,565
What the hell just happened?

118
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,100
Thank you, Commissioner Gordon,

119
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:07,168
people of Gotham.

120
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:09,237
Okay, she thinks
she's in Batman.

121
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:12,240
People often ask me,
"Joan, how do you do it?"

122
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:14,142
It's simple.

123
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:15,843
I love being on TV.

124
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,579
I've known
what I've wanted to do

125
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:19,114
since I was ten years old.

126
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:22,250
That is the key
to living a good life.

127
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:26,321
If you don't absolutely love
what you do with a true passion,

128
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:28,456
then what's the point
in doing it at all?

129
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:29,891
On a separate note,

130
00:05:29,925 --> 00:05:31,960
I think that America
should have a purge night.

131
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:34,329
Let me explain why.

132
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:37,565
Do I even like my job?

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,401
I must be the first person ever

134
00:05:40,436 --> 00:05:43,838
to have money, power,
and notoriety

135
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:46,474
but still feel empty.

136
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:48,243
I need someone to share
my life with.

137
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:52,614
What if your future wife is
somebody that you already know?

138
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:55,550
Let's open your Gryzzl page.

139
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,784
What about her?
She's cute.

140
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,686
- Date her.
- That's my cousin.

141
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:00,321
Oh. How about her?

142
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,876
That's my dad!
What's wrong with you?

143
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:02,924
I'm drunk, okay?

144
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,759
Why are you only friends
with your family?

145
00:06:04,794 --> 00:06:05,827
Ooh, look,
you just got a message

146
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:07,829
from somebody named Lucy
in Chicago.

147
00:06:07,863 --> 00:06:08,997
She looks familiar.

148
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:10,698
Yeah, we used to date.
I was super into her.

149
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,435
No, that's not it.
Was she in Destiny's Child?

150
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,672
"Hey, Tom.
Saw the article, you boss!

151
00:06:17,706 --> 00:06:20,208
Let's catch up soon.
Miss you."

152
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:22,810
Do you realize what's happening?

153
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:24,179
We have been sitting here

154
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,446
searching for your soul mate
this whole time,

155
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:27,482
and then Lucy just
Gryzzl-texts you out of nowhere?

156
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:28,917
It's a sign,
and we have to catch it.

157
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:31,686
We are going to Chicago.

158
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,223
Andy, think about what
you're saying right now,

159
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:37,525
'cause it's the smartest idea
anyone's ever had.

160
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,594
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

161
00:06:39,628 --> 00:06:41,863
Ron, what did you do?

162
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:44,232
I delivered
a flawless presentation

163
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,034
and secured tomorrow's vote.

164
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:48,503
No, you got all sneaky
and snuck around

165
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:49,904
and snooked that vote away
from me.

166
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:53,341
And I know this because earlier
I sneaked and snooked around,

167
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,243
and Jammy was supposed
to vote for me.

168
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:57,812
The snooker has become
the snorked.

169
00:06:57,847 --> 00:07:01,483
What are you talking...

170
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:03,151
She's near.

171
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:04,586
Hey, Ron.

172
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,720
Tammy.

173
00:07:05,754 --> 00:07:07,288
So you two are together now.

174
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:10,024
- My condolences to both of you.
- Mm.

175
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,159
You guys
were supposed to vote for me.

176
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:13,895
Leslie, I would never
do anything to help you.

177
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:15,697
You've always been
against me and Ron.

178
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:17,899
You're a big part of the reason
that he and I aren't together

179
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,068
and I had to settle
for this placeholder.

180
00:07:20,102 --> 00:07:21,869
I love you so much.

181
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:23,738
So you thought
if you voted for Ron,

182
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:25,373
you could actually win him back?

183
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:26,541
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:27,976
Did it work, baby?

185
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,745
Are you horny with gratitude?

186
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:35,150
You two more than deserve
each other.

187
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,786
Good luck.

188
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,387
The vote is tomorrow.

189
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:41,789
If I don't get Jamm
out from Tammy's clutches,

190
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:42,991
I'm doomed!

191
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,059
It's like rescuing a bunny
from a lion,

192
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:47,890
but that lion is
a demonic sociopath

193
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,597
with really nice cleavage.

194
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,064
All right, we're here.

195
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,665
Sir, where the hell are we?

196
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,933
Chicago.

197
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:59,102
That'll be $830.

198
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:00,136
Oh, no.

199
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:01,972
- This is so dumb.
- Awesome!

200
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,766
Turn the car around.
We're going back home.

201
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,808
No way.
Pay me.

202
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,276
And get the hell out of my cab.

203
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,245
Pay the man.

204
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,114
Chicago!

205
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,883
The Big Apple!

206
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:14,951
- Well, that's where Lucy works.
- Yeah.

207
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,453
Must have given the cabbie
the address.

208
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:17,988
Let's just get something to eat
and fly home.

209
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:19,756
What? No!
We came all this way.

210
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,191
Tom, we should at least say hi.

211
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,393
No. You can't not talk to
someone for five years and then

212
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:26,129
show up unannounced where
they work in a different city.

213
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:28,098
That's what murderers do
before they murder someone.

214
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,199
Tom?

215
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:30,767
I thought that was you.
What are you doing here?

216
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,569
Oh, uh...

217
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:34,471
You're not going
to murder me, are you?

218
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:39,509
No.
I'm here doing stuff, um...

219
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:41,611
Lucy, hey.
Andy Dwyer.

220
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,113
- Remember me?
- Yeah.

221
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,182
He's here helping me
find a place to live.

222
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:46,783
I just got a job here,

223
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,385
and then when you hit him up
on Gryzzl,

224
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,153
he was like,
"Let's go say hi to Lucy

225
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:52,522
since we're already here
in Chicago."

226
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:53,890
Yeah.
That's the deal.

227
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,258
Cool.
What job is it?

228
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:57,294
Head coach of the Chicago Bulls.

229
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,296
No, he's, uh,
working at a nonprofit.

230
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,264
No, what?
Am I?

231
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,732
Aw, that sucks.

232
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,201
Well, um, listen,
I got some stuff I got to do

233
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,869
in the office,
but I want to hang out.

234
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,237
Do you want to meet me here
in, like, an hour?

235
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:08,772
Yeah.
That sounds great.

236
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:09,773
We'll, uh, got get a little

237
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,208
Chicago deep dish pizza

238
00:09:11,242 --> 00:09:12,742
- and go watch the Bears.
- No.

239
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:14,411
I'm sorry I started doing that.

240
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:18,782
Hey, April.
How's it going?

241
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:19,916
Fine.

242
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,219
Except hearing Joan
talk about her passion

243
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:23,453
and doing what you really love,

244
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:24,888
like, totally freaked me out.

245
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:26,890
Eight years ago,
I accepted a random internship

246
00:09:26,924 --> 00:09:28,058
at the Parks Department,

247
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:29,893
and then Leslie told me
to do a bunch of stuff,

248
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:32,462
and now I'm executive director
of regional whatever...

249
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:33,830
I don't even know what it means,

250
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,266
and I never even asked myself
if I even really like it.

251
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,201
I mean, it's like
what is my purpose in life?

252
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:40,904
What do I even care about?

253
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:42,239
My insides are dying.

254
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:44,741
So, not fine.

255
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:46,443
I don't know what to do.
I have to quit.

256
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:47,644
To do what?

257
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:49,246
I'm just gonna go
live under a bridge

258
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,680
and ask people riddles
before they cross.

259
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,815
Okay, hold on.

260
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:53,650
Do you remember what Joan said
at the ceremony?

261
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:55,252
That is doesn't count
as stripping

262
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:56,520
if no one pays you?

263
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,488
Yes, she did say that, but no.

264
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:01,224
She knew she wanted to be on TV
when she was ten.

265
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,294
So what did you want to be
when you were ten?

266
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,999
It says here
the future of caskets

267
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,535
may just be
biodegradable plastic.

268
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,537
Oh, you don't say.
Hey, are you chilly?

269
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,638
I'm a little chilly, I think.

270
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:16,339
- No.
- Hey, guys.

271
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:18,141
Welcome.
I'm Dan.

272
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,943
Hi, I'm Ben.
This is April.

273
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:21,978
And I'm scared of death.

274
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:24,881
I'm just really interested
in learning what you do.

275
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,982
You're gonna love it here.

276
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:29,019
People are dying to get in.

277
00:10:29,053 --> 00:10:30,187
Come on, come on.

278
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:33,156
We'll start
down at the cadaver chute.

279
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,926
The cadaver chute.
Come on!

280
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,661
So this is where
you want to eat lunch?

281
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,895
In a steakhouse?

282
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,764
Don't you have
irritable bowel syndrome?

283
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:42,098
God, I hate that I know that.

284
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,934
Yeah, it's murder
on the old plumbing,

285
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:47,504
but, uh, Tammy only wants me
to eat steak and whiskey.

286
00:10:47,538 --> 00:10:50,474
She has my stool analyzed
just to keep me honest.

287
00:10:50,508 --> 00:10:52,609
I don't think this
relationship is that healthy.

288
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:55,779
I mean, it seems like Tammy
is trying to turn you into Ron,

289
00:10:55,813 --> 00:10:58,248
and you're Jeremy Jamm,
I mean, come on.

290
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,650
You love Porsches
and spiked iced tea,

291
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:02,452
and you have
a Hooters platinum card.

292
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,788
Yeah, Tammy doesn't really
let me do that stuff anymore.

293
00:11:04,822 --> 00:11:07,090
But, uh, you know, it's good,
you know?

294
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,225
I'm better now.

295
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,693
I mean, sure, I'm depressed,

296
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:11,995
and, uh, I'm constantly sick,

297
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,730
and nothing
really brings me joy,

298
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,899
but it just feels right.

299
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:19,202
Oh, God.

300
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:21,571
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, help me, Knope.

301
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,240
Oh, I used to be so great.

302
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:24,941
Remember?
Everybody thought so.

303
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,543
Well...

304
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:27,978
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

305
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:30,247
This is worse than I thought.

306
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:33,083
You're broken.
She has broken you.

307
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,918
You need to get away from her.

308
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:36,232
Oh, God. Whoa, hey.
Look at that.

309
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:40,991
More hair came out.

310
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:46,068
Yeah, I think you're really
going to like it here.

311
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:48,031
And obviously everyone's
in a really great mood now

312
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,599
because of the Cubs
winning the series.

313
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:50,901
Yeah, it seems really nice.

314
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:52,869
I mean, I am gonna miss
Pawnee, though.

315
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:54,871
My wife's there,
for crying out loud.

316
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:56,027
Yeah, tell me about Pawnee.

317
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,401
It sounds like
it's really changed.

318
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:59,128
Oh, yeah.
There's a ton of new businesses.

319
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:00,377
Gryzzl came in.

320
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:03,447
They gave everyone free tablets
and wi-fi and phones.

321
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,916
You can watch Hitch 2
anytime, anywhere.

322
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,584
Finally, that's the dream.

323
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:09,686
Part of me wants
to go back, you know?

324
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,521
I always kind of liked it there.

325
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,124
Man, you got me
really missing Pawnee now.

326
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:16,827
I don't know what to do.
Am I making the right decision?

327
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,831
Hey.

328
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,200
- Why are you here?
- I'm calling a temporary truce.

329
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:25,102
You need to help me
break up Jamm and Tammy.

330
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:26,503
Forget it.

331
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,538
You just want Jamm
to switch his vote.

332
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,707
What is this,
revenge for Morningstar?

333
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:32,209
No, it is not about that.

334
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:33,510
It is not about the vote.

335
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,178
There is a guy in real trouble,

336
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,546
and you might be
the only one who can help him.

337
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,248
This is
about saving someone's soul.

338
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:41,251
He is a monster.
Monsters do not have souls.

339
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,320
Uh, have you ever seen
Monsters, Inc.?

340
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:44,955
- No.
- Damn it, Ron.

341
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:46,723
Engage in the culture
once in a while.

342
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,625
Jamm, get in here.

343
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:55,032
Good God, man.
What happened to you?

344
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,500
Tammy happened to him!

345
00:12:56,534 --> 00:12:58,535
Remind you of anyone, Ron?

346
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,270
We need to put our issues aside

347
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:03,607
and defend
this miserable person.

348
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:06,009
Jeremy, this is a gold bar.

349
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:07,177
You keep that in your desk?

350
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:09,046
I will give you this gold bar

351
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,349
if you say one
unflattering thing about Tammy.

352
00:13:12,383 --> 00:13:15,152
If I do...

353
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:16,953
does Tammy get to keep the gold?

354
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:18,155
Oh, my God.

355
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:19,623
When it comes to Tammy,

356
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:21,992
the code is the same as that
of the battlefield:

357
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:24,060
First, you leave no man behind.

358
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,795
Second, you must
protect yourself

359
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,465
against chemical warfare.

360
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:31,835
Tammy does not abide
by the Geneva convention.

361
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,581
I made
this Tammy de-programming kit

362
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,156
in case I ever fell victim
to her again.

363
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:41,378
First, this is a chastity belt
that I made by hand.

364
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:43,380
It might be a couple sizes
too big for you,

365
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:45,315
but you can just pad it.

366
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,018
The first step
is to cut out all sex.

367
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:49,319
That won't be necessary.

368
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:50,587
We haven't done the deed yet.

369
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,390
She lets me rub up
against her leg sometimes.

370
00:13:53,424 --> 00:13:54,958
Well, all the more reason
to wear it.

371
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:57,227
She knows she has that card
left to play,

372
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:59,062
and you best believe she will.

373
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:01,131
We're also gonna try
a Pavlovian technique.

374
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,735
Ron is holding
Tammy's perfume, Girth.

375
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:05,869
Oh.

376
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:08,605
Oh, smells good.
Oh!

377
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,040
Again.

378
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:11,441
Tammy.
Oh!

379
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,910
How many times
are we gonna do this?

380
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:14,578
Until the bottle is empty.
Again.

381
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:15,779
Twice.

382
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,980
Tam...
Ahh!

383
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:17,981
Ahh!

384
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:19,917
It's going well so far,

385
00:14:19,951 --> 00:14:24,521
but it's too early to tell.

386
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,356
- Oh.
- He was pretty far gone.

387
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:30,194
Hopefully we get
a body in today,

388
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:33,063
so I can show you guys
the really fun part:

389
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,164
Draining.

390
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,532
Oh, God.
I hate this so much.

391
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,100
Cool.
Can I touch a dead body?

392
00:14:37,135 --> 00:14:38,869
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, eager beaver.

393
00:14:38,903 --> 00:14:40,971
That doesn't happen
for at least a year.

394
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,673
Why?
How did you become a mortician?

395
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:43,907
Can't I just sign up?

396
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:45,042
Oh, gosh, no.

397
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:46,443
You need two years of school

398
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:47,744
and a year-long apprenticeship.

399
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:51,315
First few years
are mostly paperwork and filing.

400
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,884
Ugh! Why is every job
just paperwork?

401
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:56,153
Hey, it's a living.

402
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,988
Yeah, I think
we're just gonna go, Dan.

403
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,058
Um, the reality of your life
is incredibly depressing.

404
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:02,593
I'm just gonna stay
at my current job

405
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:05,195
until I get old and die
and then end up here

406
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,563
being embalmed by some weirdo

407
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:08,198
who had to go to school
for three years

408
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,900
just to cut my guts open.

409
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:11,935
- Let's go.
- Oh, thank God.

410
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,371
Okay.
Have a good one.

411
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:15,939
Okay, we're gonna do some scenes

412
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:18,408
and demonstrate ways
that you can resist Tammy.

413
00:15:18,443 --> 00:15:20,844
I will play Tammy.
Ron will play you.

414
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,880
Hey there, horsey.

415
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:25,883
Time to mount up
and ride on into Bonertown.

416
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:29,453
What do you say we get stanky
in that pet store bathroom?

417
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:32,022
- Huh, Jamm? Hmm? Huh? Huh?
- Do it.

418
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,891
There will be
no sex today, Tammy.

419
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,159
Oh.

420
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:37,060
Instead, why don't you go
into the pet store

421
00:15:37,095 --> 00:15:38,962
and feed yourself to the snakes?

422
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:41,899
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

423
00:15:41,933 --> 00:15:43,467
Hey, you big hunk
of wiener meat.

424
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:46,703
I've got 40 handtowels,
some energy bars,

425
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,539
and a Chinese finger trap.

426
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,240
Let's get gross.

427
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:51,942
This gambit has failed.

428
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:54,278
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

429
00:15:54,312 --> 00:15:55,412
What are you wearing?

430
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:57,381
It's a crotch-blinder
of my own design.

431
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,951
In this scenario, she will be
coming at you pants-less.

432
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:02,386
Okay.

433
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,588
Doors are locked.
Window is secured.

434
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:06,924
There is no way
Tammy's getting in here.

435
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,258
Jamm.

436
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:10,861
Strip down, you sex maggot.

437
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,596
And hold!

438
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,764
What was your mistake?

439
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:16,366
You didn't check the armoire.

440
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:18,335
Tammy once camped out
in my attic

441
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,838
for six days
awaiting my arrival.

442
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:23,240
She survived on rats
and rainwater.

443
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,609
Let's run it again!

444
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:27,643
I gotta say, hanging out
with Lucy's been so fun.

445
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:28,812
She's the best.

446
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,747
And I love
that she's buying us stuff.

447
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,516
Dude, make your move.
Ask her out.

448
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,884
I don't know.
She lives here.

449
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:36,687
- How would it even work?
- Life is about taking risks.

450
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:39,122
Look at me, Tom.
I'm moving to Chicago.

451
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:40,657
It's just us right now.

452
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:41,959
Do you really think
you're moving here?

453
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,861
One double XL, one kid's XL.

454
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:45,763
- Hey, you remembered my size.
- Yeah.

455
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,397
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

456
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:48,966
Hey, Lucy,
can I ask you something?

457
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,967
Of course.
What's up?

458
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:50,934
I was wondering,

459
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:54,805
would you want to maybe...

460
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,306
come work for me in Pawnee?

461
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:59,576
I have the company,
and it's growing so fast.

462
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:01,578
I can't do it all myself,
and I need a manager,

463
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:03,113
and you're a perfect candidate.

464
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,315
Wow.
Really?

465
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,118
That does sound kind of awesome.

466
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,120
And it'd be super fun
to work with you.

467
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,689
I mean, I have to talk to my
boyfriend about it first, but...

468
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:14,625
Yeah, of course!

469
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,959
This is all perfect,

470
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,895
and everything's worked out
just as I'd hoped.

471
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,166
Hey, this is why
they call it Beantown, huh?

472
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:25,135
Hey, Jere-bear.

473
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,404
What are you doing
with these two jabronis?

474
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:30,340
Tammy, I've given this
a lot of thought.

475
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,075
We should break up.

476
00:17:34,979 --> 00:17:36,179
What's the matter, little boy?

477
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,282
Did the bad people get to you?

478
00:17:38,316 --> 00:17:41,285
They just made me realize how
unhealthy this is, literally.

479
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,654
All the steak and whiskey...
I have to wear a diaper.

480
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,956
That's 'cause
you're my widdle baby.

481
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,191
We drilled you on this, Jamm.

482
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:48,458
Baby talk, what do you do?

483
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:51,228
I'm not a baby.
I'm a big boy!

484
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:53,497
Yeah, okay. That...
well, that wasn't terrible.

485
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,333
Don't listen to Leslie.
She's trying to manipulate you.

486
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,669
All she cares about is herself,
and I can prove it.

487
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,737
How's this, Leslie?

488
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:04,041
You leave us alone,
and we swing the vote to you?

489
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:07,811
Help you get your park.

490
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,546
No. Nice try.

491
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:11,415
Stay strong, Jeremy.

492
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,150
- It's over, Tammy.
- Tell you what.

493
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:15,185
It's been long enough.

494
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,289
What do you say we
consummate our relationship...

495
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:20,924
tonight?

496
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,660
Huh?
Let's do it.

497
00:18:23,695 --> 00:18:27,731
And the last card is played.

498
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:30,501
- What are you doing?
- Shh! This is a library.

499
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:31,735
Do you see
what's happening here?

500
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,637
Ron, I need
that crotch-blinder.

501
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:36,640
No, you don't.
Just end it.

502
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:38,775
- Look at my boobs.
- No.

503
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,977
- Look downstairs.
- No.

504
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:41,211
There's a prize inside for you.

505
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,179
It's over, Tammy.

506
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:43,247
What?

507
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:46,383
To hell with you, woman.
Good-bye.

508
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:49,920
How dare you?
Are you kidding me?

509
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,156
You'll be back!
They all come back!

510
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,258
Well done, Jeremy.

511
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:57,427
Turns out the crotch-blinder
was inside you all along.

512
00:18:57,462 --> 00:18:59,877
Everybody,
who wants to get it on?

513
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:01,074
I'm naked!

514
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:04,525
Donna, what do I do?

515
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,827
If working around corpses
isn't even right for me,

516
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,562
then nothing is.

517
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:11,131
I feel totally lost.

518
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,434
- Saturn's return.
- What?

519
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:16,770
Saturn's orbit around the sun
takes roughly 29 years,

520
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:18,839
and when it gets back to where
it was when you were born,

521
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:21,242
lots of turmoil,
self-discovery.

522
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,376
When I was your age,

523
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,545
I got banned
from every riverboat in Germany.

524
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:26,814
Donna, April,
what are you up to?

525
00:19:26,848 --> 00:19:29,350
Oh, you know,
just regionally directing

526
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:31,151
the Midwest whatever
of who cares.

527
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:32,253
Oh, isn't it great?

528
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,522
Can you believe
that they pay me for this?

529
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,724
Because I would do this
for free.

530
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,692
Aw, jeez!

531
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:42,196
I do miss you, Terry.

532
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,731
Let me get you some napkins.

533
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,234
April, you looked
at one horrifying job.

534
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,702
I've got a few more ideas.

535
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:50,571
We'll find you
something you like, okay?

536
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,139
Okay.

537
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:53,841
But you can't tell Leslie
I might leave.

538
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,676
She'll have a heart attack.
Promise?

539
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,877
I promise.

540
00:19:56,912 --> 00:19:58,479
Why are you
so into helping me right now?

541
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:01,048
Because I'm finally doing
what I love,

542
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,350
and I know how hard it is
to get to that place.

543
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:08,022
And I want you to be happy
because you're my friend.

544
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:11,525
No, I'm not.
I've never cared for you.

545
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:17,865
Wait, wait.

546
00:20:17,899 --> 00:20:21,735
You're behaving very strangely.

547
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,671
Saturn's return.

548
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:25,272
Hey, Brokemons.

549
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,507
I just wanted to let you know

550
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,109
that I will be abstaining
from the vote today.

551
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,278
You are
my two all-time best friends,

552
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,580
and you brought me back
from the brink,

553
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,748
so I can't choose sides.

554
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:37,384
Although if I had to pick
one side, it would be

555
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:39,520
Lucy Liu's backside.

556
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:45,259
Without Jamm,
the vote's two-two.

557
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,228
This was all for nothing.

558
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:48,696
I thought it was very big of you

559
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,792
to not bend when Tammy
promised you the vote.

560
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:54,597
Well, I thought it was very big
of you to help him at all.

561
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:56,632
You didn't have to do that.

562
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,260
Okay, back to work to figure out
how to destroy you.

563
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,374
Same. Good bye.

564
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,834
Dude, thank you so much for this.
I really owe you one.

565
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:07,719
No, you don't.

566
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,440
You're smart and qualified
and we're totally lucky to have you.

567
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:11,748
Okay, let's do this.

568
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:15,589
Still don't know what claiming
allowances means. I always put 6.

569
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,787
- So far so good.
- Dude, you are totally going to jail.

570
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,637
This couldn't have worked out any better.

571
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:24,744
There was a guy eating lunch in here
who didn't finish his spaghetti.

572
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,641
Oh, also, Tom and Lucy
are totally going to fall in love!

573
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:30,331
Five second rule!

574
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:35,873
