1
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:08,765
We need to go over the schedule
leading up to the primary.

2
00:00:08,802 --> 00:00:10,401
- Let's talk shop.
- Ooh, shop talk!

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,145
One of my five favorite
types of talk,

4
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:14,399
along with pillow, girl,
real, and TED.

5
00:00:14,434 --> 00:00:16,001
Why are you wearing a poncho?

6
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:19,338
Oh, because every surface area
in your house is sticky.

7
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:22,007
Last time I was here, I found
a melted crayon on my blazer.

8
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,142
Okay.

9
00:00:23,176 --> 00:00:25,677
I have a photo op
with Gryzzl tomorrow.

10
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:27,813
Between now and then, we
have a ton of stuff scheduled.

11
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:30,582
Looks like we're gonna have
to skip the pie-baking event

12
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:32,184
and the ceremonial squash toss.

13
00:00:32,218 --> 00:00:33,152
- Oh.
- Oh, really?

14
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:34,420
We have to skip that?

15
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:36,655
I love watching those squashes
fly through the air.

16
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:37,923
I kind of like
the way they land.

17
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:38,924
Me too!

18
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,160
Okay, excuse me,

19
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:44,530
but I have to get back to a city
where things happen.

20
00:00:44,564 --> 00:00:45,664
Okay.

21
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:47,399
This campaign is about to start
in earnest.

22
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:49,535
Things are about to get
real intense.

23
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:50,736
Leslie, you ready?

24
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,804
- Me Leslie?
- Yeah.

25
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:53,605
Well, I was an actual candidate,

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,741
so I think I can handle
being a candidate's wife.

27
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,309
I know all the issues
inside and out.

28
00:00:57,343 --> 00:00:58,810
Mm.
See, that's the problem.

29
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:01,280
Being the wife of
is a minefield.

30
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:02,448
If you were just
a ding-dong,

31
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,016
I would just
slap a flag pin on you.

32
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,551
I'd pour some Valium
down your throat

33
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:08,520
and just shove you behind
the podium way upstage.

34
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:11,223
It's the smarties
that freak people out.

35
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:12,925
I think you're underestimating
the voters.

36
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:18,497
I don't think that is possible.

37
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,765
Stephen, be careful!

38
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:24,369
Poncho!

39
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:35,380

40
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,959
I know you normally
hate foundations,

41
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:49,328
but this one
I think you'll actually like.

42
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:51,697
We take people that don't know
what they want to do

43
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:54,533
and then put them to work doing
cool stuff all over the world,

44
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,875
and I start in a couple months.

45
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:59,171
Well, I had hoped you'd choose
a more dignified trade

46
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:01,473
like masonry or logging,

47
00:02:01,507 --> 00:02:03,475
but you are
out of local government,

48
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,444
and that's a step
in the right direction.

49
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:07,880
It's definitely
the job I wanted...

50
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:13,919
But it means that we
have to move to Washington.

51
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:17,523
Well...
then bully for you.

52
00:02:17,557 --> 00:02:19,291
If you intend to move,

53
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:22,394
I suppose you should return
the spare key to my house,

54
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:25,531
the one I gave you years ago
when you were my assistant,

55
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:27,433
for emergencies.

56
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:28,500
Okay.

57
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:30,836
Good talk.

58
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,040
This neighborhood

59
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:37,092
has been mostly abandoned
for years,

60
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:39,546
but now, thanks
to the new Gryzzl headquarters,

61
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,815
this district will soon
transform

62
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,918
into a hub of innovation
for decades to come.

63
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:45,919
Mr. Wyatt!

64
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:47,654
Your campaign released
a schedule,

65
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:50,123
and it looks like your wife
is skipping the Pie-mary.

66
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:51,458
Care to explain?

67
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:54,060
The Pie-mary
is a Southern Indiana tradition

68
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:55,628
where Congressional
candidates' wives

69
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,098
face off
in a pie-baking contest.

70
00:02:58,132 --> 00:02:59,633
The last contest winner

71
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,668
was June Hartwell's
buttermilk meringue.

72
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:05,105
Last contest loser
was all women.

73
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,207
Leslie would be the first
candidate's wife

74
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,842
not to enter the Pie-mary.

75
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:11,478
What kind of a statement
are you making by skipping it?

76
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:13,380
We're... I'm not making
any kind of statement.

77
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:15,415
We're just focusing
on bigger issues,

78
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:20,053
like Ben's $150 million
revitalization project.

79
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,254
Pardon me.
I need to get through.

80
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,255
Pardon me. Excuse me.

81
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,323
Mike Patterson here.

82
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:24,557
Leslie, you've
made it pretty clear

83
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:26,352
that you don't think homemaking
is important.

84
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,028
Do you ever cook
for your children,

85
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,530
and who's even watching
your children right now,

86
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:32,098
while you're out
God only knows where?

87
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,214
What are you talking about?

88
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:34,701
I'm standing right here
in front of you.

89
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:36,536
Okay. Take it easy.
Let's not get emotional.

90
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,938
Okay.
We have to run.

91
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:39,706
We'll see you all
at my economic address.

92
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,907
Thanks for coming, everybody.

93
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:42,776
What other traditions
are you against, Leslie?

94
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,511
Baseball?
Hugging your children?

95
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:46,212
How much did that haircut cost?

96
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:48,381
None of your business,
and thank you for noticing.

97
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:50,650
My desk was right here,

98
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,319
sitting right on top of it
this whole time.

99
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:53,353
How much money is it?

100
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:54,387
It's not money.

101
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:55,789
I told you, it's Ron's key.

102
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:57,223
I hid it in here years ago.

103
00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:58,558
Ah! Wait!

104
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,859
Yeah, no. No key.

105
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:02,896
Just a note and a movie ticket
stub and four teeth.

106
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,251
"If you are looking
for Ron's key,

107
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:06,032
"I moved it,
and you'll never find it.

108
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,367
Cordially, April."

109
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:08,668
Well, where'd you put it, then?

110
00:04:08,703 --> 00:04:10,203
I don't know.
It was eight years ago.

111
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:11,638
Oh, God.

112
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:14,240
A key to Ron's house is lost
in a government building.

113
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:15,356
That's his worst nightmare.

114
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:16,309
Listen, babe.

115
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:17,811
All we got to do

116
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:20,714
is train Champion
to sniff out Ron's key.

117
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:22,082
Okay.

118
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:24,184
All we need is Ron's key
to give him a scent.

119
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:26,252
So give me the key,
and I'll get you that key.

120
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:31,625
No, You're Wrong
with Mike Patterson.

121
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:32,726
Welcome back to the program.

122
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,427
My guest is June Hartwell,

123
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:36,863
wife of incumbent Congressman,
Paul Hartwell.

124
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,064
Now, June, we all know

125
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,619
what Ben Wyatt's wife
is really saying.

126
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:41,034
By skipping the Pie-mary,

127
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:44,337
she's saying women who love
their families are stupid.

128
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,773
Well, Mike, we all
make certain choices.

129
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:49,042
Ms. Knope chose
to try to have it all.

130
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:51,011
I chose to put my family first.

131
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:52,325
Well, I'm just speculating here,

132
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:54,014
but do you think
that Leslie Knope's actions

133
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:56,383
indicate that she actually hates
her family?

134
00:04:56,417 --> 00:05:00,420
Well, it only took three hours
for Jen to be right.

135
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:01,988
I'm officially a distraction.

136
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:03,189
I'm gonna enter
that Pie-mary.

137
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:05,091
This is just nonsense.
It'll blow over.

138
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:07,794
And the Pie-mary
is ridiculous and antiquated.

139
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:09,195
But the more
they talk about this,

140
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,398
the less they're gonna talk
about your economic plan.

141
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:13,033
Besides,
I'm good at making pies,

142
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:15,769
so I'll win,
and then I can promote

143
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:18,672
my self-published women's rights
barbecue cookbook...

144
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:20,206
The Feminine Mesquite.

145
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:21,708
Everything's fine.

146
00:05:21,742 --> 00:05:23,343
I had it in a safe place,

147
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:25,478
and then I moved it
to protect it,

148
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:27,300
and I don't remember where.

149
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:28,324
I see.

150
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:29,792
Don't be mad, Ron.

151
00:05:29,826 --> 00:05:32,061
She hid it too good,

152
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:34,096
and she left a string of clues.

153
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,400
It's an impossible puzzle,
and I love puzzles!

154
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:41,537
A minimal, unhelpful note,
these appear to be human teeth,

155
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:42,538
and what is this?

156
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:43,839
Twilight: New Moon.

157
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:46,342
It's a movie,
but I've never seen it.

158
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:48,110
It's, like,
about lame werewolves

159
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:49,378
and vampires and stuff.

160
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,680
Donna likes those things!

161
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:53,449
Dollars to doughnuts
this points us her way.

162
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:56,652
Finally, a scavenger hunt
worthy of my time.

163
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:57,720
Onward!

164
00:05:58,722 --> 00:05:59,855
Okay.

165
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,991
Snacks given, kids tucked in,
books read,

166
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:04,259
three simultaneous meltdowns
for no reason,

167
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:05,861
kids tucked back in,

168
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:08,264
one of them briefly
got outside somehow,

169
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:09,231
kids back in bed.

170
00:06:09,265 --> 00:06:10,499
They're all napping.

171
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:13,469
Okay, I got everything
you need for pie domination.

172
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,571
I even got
an extra whipped-cream can.

173
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,907
One for baking,
one for directly-into-mouth.

174
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:20,543
Oh, you know me so well.

175
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:24,480
That might be one of the kids.

176
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:25,514
Hi, Leslie.

177
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:26,682
Elise Yarktin

178
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,517
from the Indiana
Organization of Women.

179
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,920
Oh, my goodness!
Elise, please come in.

180
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:32,187
Wait!

181
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:34,490
Are you here to give me
the Woman of the Year award?

182
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,791
I have a speech prepared.

183
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:37,426
Would you like
to see it right now?

184
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,427
No.

185
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:39,862
Leslie, we were thrilled

186
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,031
to find out you were boycotting
that ridiculous Pie-mary,

187
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:43,899
but we just got word
you've decided to enter?

188
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,367
Yeah.

189
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:48,203
Well, I agree that it's dumb,
but this is not about me.

190
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:51,674
It's about Ben, and he will do
more for women than Hartwell.

191
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,542
So, you know, lose a battle,
win the war.

192
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,010
That kind of thing.
It's the way to go.

193
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,712
Look, the Pie-mary
is retrogressive

194
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:58,914
and misogynistic,
and if you participate,

195
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:00,015
we will have no choice

196
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,251
but to protest you and Ben
at the event.

197
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,420
Hope you like pies...

198
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,388
in yo' face.

199
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:08,123
Metaphorically.
We'll be civil.

200
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:11,427
Elise, there is no bigger
defender of gender equality

201
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,429
than Leslie Knope,
and my husband, Ben,

202
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:16,565
is a progressive champion
of women's rights.

203
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,133
Babe, the oven's ready.

204
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:19,835
Chop-chop!
Time to get baking.

205
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,504
Daddy want pie!

206
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:24,282
Hi. Ben Wyatt.

207
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,256
We have a wonderfully
small number of clues.

208
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:30,709
One is this ticket.

209
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:33,612
Did you see this movie
about vampires and such?

210
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:34,546
New Moon?

211
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,215
Yeah, I saw it with April.

212
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,050
She was so hopped up
on painkillers

213
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:39,451
from getting
her wisdom teeth out,

214
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:41,020
I convinced her
to see it with me.

215
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:42,922
The teeth!
They're yours.

216
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:44,557
You were super out of it.

217
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,992
You kept yelling,
"Team Voldemort!" at the screen,

218
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:48,160
and we were kicked out.

219
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:49,828
I was furious.

220
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:51,697
You only get to see
the second Twilight film

221
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,065
for the seventh time once.

222
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,234
Do you remember anything
about a key

223
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:58,037
or April doing
anything unusual that day?

224
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,539
She did make us stop
by the shoe-shine stand

225
00:08:00,574 --> 00:08:01,974
before she left,
because she wanted

226
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,642
to drop something off for Andy.

227
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,411
She had a real bad crush on him.

228
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:09,248
Oh, babe! You had a crush on me!

229
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,516
That's embarrassing.

230
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,483
We're married.

231
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:12,785
Still!

232
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,386
To the shoe-shine stand!

233
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,956
- Stop! Stop!
- Ooh, chase me!

234
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,361
Garry, what the hell
are you doing?

235
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:23,529
Oh, gosh.

236
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:25,798
Well, I dropped my wedding ring
down this grate,

237
00:08:25,832 --> 00:08:27,233
and then I was trying
to get it out,

238
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,968
and I dropped my keys
down there too,

239
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:31,003
so I can't leave.

240
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:32,738
Damn. This takes me back.

241
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,206
You mind if I stay and watch?

242
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,207
Oh, not at all.

243
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,642
Appreciate the company.

244
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,610
The I.O.W.
does not mess around,

245
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:39,945
which, normally,
is why I love them,

246
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,313
but now I'm on the other side.

247
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:42,481
Oh, my God, Ben!

248
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,516
I gave them $100
in their annual pledge.

249
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:47,119
Do you know how many anti-me
signs that could buy?

250
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,955
You just don't do
the pie contest, obviously.

251
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,523
Then we're just back
where we started.

252
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:52,879
Then it just seems
like I'm saying

253
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm better
than the women who bake.

254
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:56,362
What should we do?
Should we get a divorce?

255
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:58,130
Well, how about this?

256
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:00,099
What if I register
for the contest?

257
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,367
I bake the pie.

258
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:03,002
I act as my own wife.

259
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,236
Oh, that could work.

260
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:06,271
We sidestep the controversy,

261
00:09:06,306 --> 00:09:09,308
we refocus the campaign
onto the actual candidate,

262
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:12,144
and then we flip the antiquated
tradition right on its head.

263
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,713
Exactly, but more importantly,

264
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:18,951
we change the idea
of what a pie is.

265
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:20,686
I feel like
that's not more important,

266
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,088
but I-I like the energy
that we have, so let's hear it.

267
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:24,256
Okay. Picture this.

268
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,926
Crust on the bottom,
filling, crust on top.

269
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,061
What am I describing?

270
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:30,229
A pie.

271
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,665
No, but you're
in the right zone.

272
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:33,666
Oh.

273
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,367
- Calzone!
- Sure.

274
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:38,003
Pies are just
sweet calzones, honey,

275
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:40,005
and I'm good at making calzones.

276
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
You're amazing.

277
00:09:41,074 --> 00:09:42,308
I can win this thing.

278
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:43,809
Of course you can, baby!

279
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:45,244
Get in there and start baking!

280
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:47,446
♪ Talk about the highway ♪

281
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,849
♪ To the calzone-zone! ♪

282
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:54,320
I am having
some serious déj? vu.

283
00:09:54,354 --> 00:09:55,955
How many times have you lost
your wedding ring?

284
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,856
Oh, G...

285
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:00,092
Too many times to count.

286
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:01,827
And it causes
real trouble with Gayle.

287
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,301
Yeah, I mean,
anytime I lose my ring,

288
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,364
she turns
into a real grumpy goose.

289
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:06,899
- Is that so?
- Oh, yeah.

290
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,834
She'll say, you know,
"Garry, you'd lose your head

291
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:10,302
if it wasn't screwed
on tight."

292
00:10:10,337 --> 00:10:12,037
And then she makes me go

293
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:14,173
for the fresh oranges
for the morning OJ.

294
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:18,143
Yeah, I mean,
she says, "Hey, Mr. Forgetful."

295
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:19,578
Well, I mean,
those words...

296
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:21,008
I mean, they rattle
around here for hours.

297
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:22,734
That's why
I've got to be extra careful

298
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:24,890
with this replacement ring,
because if I lost...

299
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:32,768
I'm gonna order us some dinner.

300
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:37,426
The shoe-shine stand
is gone...

301
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:40,062
or maybe it was never here.

302
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,977
They must have moved
it during the remodel.

303
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,066
It's probably
in basement storage.

304
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,101
To the basement!

305
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:51,040
- Tighter!
- Are you sure, dude?

306
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:52,842
Yeah, dude. Tighter.
I can do it.

307
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:53,976
Do what exactly?

308
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:55,678
Nothing.
We're not doing anything.

309
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:57,947
And we definitely
do not live down here now.

310
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:00,283
Guys, where's the old
shoe-shine stand from upstairs?

311
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:01,717
We don't know anything
about that.

312
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:02,752
Boys, think.

313
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:03,920
We are on a quest,

314
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,155
and we are not leaving
until we get an answer.

315
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,057
Well, we're on our own quest,

316
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:10,259
which is to squeeze this
just tight enough

317
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,994
to make my eyes bulge out
a little bit,

318
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,629
but not so tight that I die.

319
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:14,745
Oh, I've been there.

320
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:16,232
That's a real tightrope walk.

321
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:18,267
Oh! Hey!

322
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,838
Last week this real scary ghost
came down here looking for it.

323
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:24,841
It had black hair, but you could
see through its skin,

324
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,309
and it didn't like me,

325
00:11:26,343 --> 00:11:28,711
but that's just 'cause
I got a soul of a Ghostbuster.

326
00:11:28,745 --> 00:11:30,012
Yeah, it said something

327
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:32,782
about how it was worried
Brett was gonna mug it.

328
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:35,752
Okay, so we're looking
for a racist ghost

329
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,987
with black hair
who likes shoe shines.

330
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,388
I think I have the answer.

331
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:41,657
The chase continues!

332
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:43,960
Okay, wait.

333
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,895
The time that you told us you
were mugged in the park,

334
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,430
what were you
reaching for in the river?

335
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:49,398
- A burrito.
- That's right!

336
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:52,368
You fell in the river
reaching for a burrito.

337
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:54,570
Yes, ma'am, that was not
one of my finer moments.

338
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,507
Ooh, it's getting late.
We need to bounce.

339
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,776
- I can give you a ride.
- Oh, thank you, Donna.

340
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,677
Probably gonna get an earful
when I get home tonight.

341
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:05,047
Gayle might even call me
the B word.

342
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,149
"Bozo."

343
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,750
- Wow.
- Mm.

344
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:10,186
We are very different people.

345
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:12,855
Did you hear back from Elise?

346
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,257
Oh, yeah, we're good.

347
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,858
The I.O.W.
is not gonna protest us.

348
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:17,760
How's your pie?

349
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,862
I don't know.
I didn't make a pie.

350
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:20,863
Okay.

351
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:22,431
How is your dessert calzone?

352
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,566
It's ready.

353
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,202
The question is, are they?

354
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:27,637
All right.

355
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:31,007
Our next contestant is candidate
Ben Wyatt's wife, Leslie.

356
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,843
Let's see what Mrs. Wyatt
has baked up for us, shall we?

357
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:35,745
It's actually Ms. Knope,

358
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,014
and, actually, right now
it's Mr. Wyatt.

359
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,615
Leslie has her own busy life,

360
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,784
and I happen to be
an excellent pie maker,

361
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,886
so we figured
we'd switch it up a bit.

362
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:45,822
Now, pack your suitcases,

363
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:48,991
because we're going
to a little town

364
00:12:49,026 --> 00:12:52,662
called a-Napoli
in Ital-y.

365
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:55,498
Free Ben Wyatt! Free Ben Wyatt!

366
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:58,034
Excuse me.
Free me from what?

367
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,936
From the tyranny of women.

368
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,304
We are the Male Men.

369
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:03,039
We are a men's rights
activist group,

370
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,507
and we are fed up!

371
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,242
I'm sorry.
What's happening now?

372
00:13:06,276 --> 00:13:11,714
Behind every successful woman
is a man she has oppressed.

373
00:13:11,748 --> 00:13:14,684
First, Leslie Knope
poaches her husband's campaign

374
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:16,352
by making it all about her.

375
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:18,454
Now she's forcing him
to bake pies

376
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:20,289
and enter a contest for her?

377
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:21,357
Oh, excuse me!

378
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:22,692
I'm not forcing him
to do anything.

379
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:23,926
He loves to cook.

380
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:26,696
He... he has five
personalized aprons.

381
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,865
Oh, so I guess
he was asking for it

382
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:30,366
because of the way
he was dressed.

383
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:35,472
We are sick and tired
of this feminized society!

384
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:38,160
Men have had
a very rough go of it

385
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:42,398
for... just recently,
and it ends now!

386
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:44,133
Male and proud!

387
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,830
Male and proud! Male and proud!

388
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:51,140
Leslie Knope exemplifies

389
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,562
the feminist attack
on our values.

390
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:54,930
She could learn
a little something

391
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,765
about traditional
family structure

392
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,667
from me and my husband,
Marshall.

393
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,802
Um, fierce alert!
Eat 'em up, honey!

394
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:02,204
The idea that feminism

395
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:04,773
is an attack on family values
is absurd.

396
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:07,142
Ooh, so you're
defending Leslie Knope.

397
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:08,610
No. Absolutely not.

398
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,212
Frankly, I don't
think she's done enough

399
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:13,048
to distance herself
from this misogynistic lunacy.

400
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:15,684
Let's turn,
now, to Sasha Dunkirk.

401
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:19,087
She is head of the group
Women Against Feminism.

402
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:20,956
What a surprise!

403
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,559
The woman is only talking
to other women.

404
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:27,195
Can we have one conversation
about feminism

405
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,997
where men get to be in charge?

406
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:30,665
I actually agree with him.

407
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,634
I don't need your pity.

408
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:35,804
Joan, Leslie Knope and I
are united

409
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,839
in our disgust
of this week's events.

410
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:41,643
Leslie, if you're watching,
I, Brandi Maxxxx,

411
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:45,714
star of 69 Jump Street
and 50 Shaved Old Gays,

412
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:47,115
have your back.

413
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,183
Oof!

414
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:50,085
Really stepped in it
this time, Knope.

415
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:51,753
Why isn't
the other candidate's wife

416
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,255
being scrutinized like this?

417
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:56,858
Because June Hartwell
is a lukewarm bowl of nothing.

418
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:58,293
She started
an awareness campaign

419
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,561
called "Bring a Sweater."

420
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:01,129
She calls it
goose-bump prevention.

421
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:02,597
Come on, you guys,
you know the drill.

422
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:04,366
Just ignore the fact
that you're right,

423
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,936
put on your blandest outfits,
so that one, hopefully,

424
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,930
and then just go out there
and publicly apologize.

425
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:10,906
Done.

426
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,874
- What?
- Apologize for what?

427
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,787
Doesn't matter.
Just say you're sorry.

428
00:15:14,907 --> 00:15:16,122
It's like taking
a shot of tequila.

429
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:17,744
You just got to force it down.

430
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:20,013
Suddenly, the world feels
so much more pleasant.

431
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,548
I do three shots every time
I have to enter this house.

432
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:28,187
Donna, what are you
doing here so early?

433
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:29,389
I come bearing gifts.

434
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:31,324
First off,
I got a dude in maintenance

435
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:32,759
to open up that grate
this morning.

436
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:37,196
So here's your rings,
keys, credit cards,

437
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:38,898
and I found some heart medicine
I assume is yours.

438
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:41,034
Yeah, no, that's mine.
That's mine. Oh, my gosh.

439
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,502
Also, I thought I'd bring over

440
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:44,370
some fresh oranges
for you and Gayle.

441
00:15:44,405 --> 00:15:46,572
Okay, well,
that is just so kind, Donna.

442
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:47,707
Thank you.

443
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:49,876
- You're one of a kind, Garry.
- Oh.

444
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,478
And I just want to thank you
for taking me down memory lane,

445
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:53,880
you big B word.

446
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:56,182
- Oh.
- "Buddy."

447
00:15:57,818 --> 00:16:00,553
So much has
changed around here.

448
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:03,756
Uhh, I just wanted to remember
the good old days,

449
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,925
when a shoe shine was two bits

450
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,562
and there were no Mexicans
in the music business.

451
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:11,497
If you don't mind,
Councilman Milton,

452
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:13,666
we just need
to search this stand.

453
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:15,535
Yes! Found it.

454
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:21,941
"Hi, Andy.
I hate people, but you are okay.

455
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:23,943
It's weird. Woof, woof.
April."

456
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,411
Oh, my God, babe,
you were so into me.

457
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:26,679
That's hilarious.

458
00:16:26,714 --> 00:16:27,880
That's it.

459
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:30,516
It's a dead end.
No more clues.

460
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:34,320
See me in my office.

461
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:36,055
If it makes you feel any better,

462
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,125
I had a big crush on you too.

463
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,462
It does make me feel
a little better. Thanks.

464
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:44,097
Oh, thank God.

465
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:46,165
Get off my boat!

466
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:48,568
Good afternoon.

467
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:50,770
I'm here today
to share with you all

468
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:54,274
my vision for the economic
future of Southern Indiana,

469
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:58,311
but first, Leslie Knope,
my wife...

470
00:16:58,345 --> 00:16:59,512
has a brief statement.

471
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:00,546
Hello, everyone.

472
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:01,681
Thank you. Wow.

473
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:03,616
How about this weather
we're having?

474
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,051
Very temperate.

475
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:06,052
Okay.

476
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:08,087
Recently,
I made an attempt to...

477
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:09,622
Actually, hang on. Stop.

478
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:13,793
I'm sorry. This whole thing
just makes me queasy

479
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:17,397
I love how independent
my wife is,

480
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:20,433
and because of that,
I will not let her speak.

481
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,901
That came out wrong.

482
00:17:21,935 --> 00:17:25,438
The point is
Leslie is a great mother,

483
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:28,274
public servant,
all-around person,

484
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,711
and I am tired of everybody
constantly telling her

485
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,880
that she's making
the wrong choice.

486
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:36,916
So you can say
whatever you want.

487
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:39,585
I couldn't care less about
the political consequences.

488
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,622
Thank you, Ben.

489
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:44,991
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is say sorry.

490
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:48,961
I'm sorry that the spotlight
is on me and not on Ben,

491
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:51,931
because he is going to make
a great congressman.

492
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:53,499
Second, the Male Men.

493
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:54,867
Where are you? Ah!

494
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:56,869
You're ridiculous,
and men's rights is nothing.

495
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:59,272
Third, I'm now gonna give you
permanent answers

496
00:17:59,306 --> 00:18:01,874
to all the silly questions that
you're gonna end up asking me

497
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:04,210
and every other woman in this
election over the next few months.

498
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:06,045
Why did I change my hairstyle?

499
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,281
Well, I don't know, I just
thought it would look better.

500
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:10,116
Or my kids got gum in it.

501
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,718
Are you trying to have it all?

502
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:14,087
That question makes no sense.
It's a stupid question.

503
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:15,622
Stop asking it.
Don't ask it.

504
00:18:15,656 --> 00:18:17,290
Do you miss your kids
while you're at work?

505
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:18,958
Yes, of course I do.

506
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:20,360
Everybody does.

507
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:22,795
And then, you know,
sometimes I don't.

508
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,198
Yeah, and by the way, no one's
ever asked me that question.

509
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:27,100
No one asks me,
"Where are your kids?"

510
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:28,434
Or "Who's taking care
of them?"

511
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:30,403
By the way, who is taking care
of the kids right now?

512
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:31,537
My mom, babe.
Everything's fine.

513
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:32,539
Right.

514
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:33,973
So maybe Leslie doesn't fit

515
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:37,043
your personal idea of what
a candidate's wife should be.

516
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,611
So what?

517
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:40,380
That's good,
because there shouldn't be

518
00:18:40,414 --> 00:18:41,547
just one idea anyway.

519
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:42,715
That's right.

520
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,083
If you want to bake a pie,
that's great.

521
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:45,785
If you want to have a career,
that's great too.

522
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,987
Do both or neither.
It doesn't matter.

523
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,957
Just don't judge what
someone else has decided to do.

524
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:53,459
I mean, we're all just trying
to find the right path for us

525
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:57,130
as individuals on this Earth.

526
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:04,537
I'd say that's 50/50
boos and cheers.

527
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:05,738
Yeah, that seems about right.

528
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:08,775
Let Ben speak!
Let Ben speak!

529
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:09,742
He just spoke.

530
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:11,711
Oh. Sorry.
I-I just got here.

531
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:12,979
I had a broken bike chain.

532
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:14,247
My bad.

533
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,653
So I guess we are celebrating

534
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:21,576
that you trusted me
and I let you down.

535
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:22,711
Great.

536
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,014
I change my house locks
every 16 days.

537
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:27,549
That key has been useless

538
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,086
since the second Tuesday
after I gave it to you.

539
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,522
What matters is that I trust you

540
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,091
and admire you as a person.

541
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,094
I will be sorry
to see you leave this town

542
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:41,663
for many reasons...

543
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,131
not the least of which

544
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:46,835
is that you created a puzzle
that even I couldn't solve.

545
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:51,373
And boy, oh, boy,
did you love Andy.

546
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:55,744
"Woof, woof."

547
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,612
It really is embarrassing.

548
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,714
Oh, my God.
I totally know where the key is.

549
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:09,591
How'd you remember?

550
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,060
"Woof, woof."

551
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:13,295
Bark.

552
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,564
Why here?

553
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:19,601
Because this tree
reminds me of you.

554
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,703
It's strong and quiet

555
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,410
and always here when you need it...

556
00:20:26,983 --> 00:20:28,392
or whatever.

557
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,158
I have always felt a
certain kinship with April,

558
00:20:32,193 --> 00:20:33,673
and this is proof
that I was correct...

559
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,368
not the nice things
she said about me,

560
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,837
the fact that I buried
a large amount of gold

561
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,939
under that same tree years ago.

562
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,943
I've since moved it.

563
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,878
Or have I?

564
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,115
- Elise.
- Oh...

565
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:51,683
What did I do wrong now?

566
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,185
No, actually,
we at the I.O.W.

567
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,887
loved what you said
in your speech.

568
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,155
Really?

569
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,725
But what we loved even more
was how you, Ben,

570
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,029
gave Leslie a platform
in which to speak her mind.

571
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,334
Congratulations, Ben Wyatt.

572
00:21:07,454 --> 00:21:10,769
You are this year's I.O.W.
Woman of the Year.

573
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,389
Son of a bitch.

574
