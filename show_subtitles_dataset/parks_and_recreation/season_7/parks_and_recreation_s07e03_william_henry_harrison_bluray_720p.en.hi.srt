1
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:18,746
So, gentlemen, you have evidence

2
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:20,381
that the Newport land
should be preserved.

3
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:21,916
Absolutely.

4
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,118
You see, I'm a ninth level
Octopriest

5
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:25,987
in the Church
of the Reasonableists.

6
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:26,954
Oh, boy.

7
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:29,724
The land is sacred
in our religion.

8
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:32,760
Because it's the place where all
human souls will be transmuted

9
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:34,695
when Zorpe the Lizard God
passes through

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,564
Jupiter's sphincter.

11
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:38,666
- Hail, Zorpe.
- Hail, Zorpe!

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,235
I'm looking for anything
to strengthen my case

13
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,371
that the Newport land should
become a park,

14
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:44,839
and not a corpate campus.

15
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:47,174
Religious reasons,
animal conservation,

16
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:48,342
historical significance.

17
00:00:48,377 --> 00:00:49,377
Anything.

18
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:51,646
So hold on to your straws,
everybody.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,048
'cause Mama's going graspin'.

20
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:57,285
In 1980, there were more
than 600 million

21
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:00,354
Indiana brown ants
in that forest.

22
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:04,592
Today, there are only
595 million.

23
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:08,596
At that rate, they'll all be
gone by the year 2030.

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,732
- 60.
- 200 and 3,060?

25
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,101
- 200,000 years from now?
- Yes.

26
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:16,170
That doesn't seem like
an immediate crisis.

27
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,172
I got a different idea
for that land.

28
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:20,908
An amusement park
with rides and food

29
00:01:20,943 --> 00:01:22,777
and sexy cartoon characters.

30
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:26,180
- I call it Disneyland.
- How did you get in here?

31
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:28,082
Broke a window.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,124

33
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:50,784
Oh, hey, guys.
Come on in.

34
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:53,052
You guys, I am Roscoe.

35
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:55,574
I am Vice President of
Cool New Shizz here at Gryzzl.

36
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:58,136
Feel free in this meeting
to break out your vapes

37
00:01:58,264 --> 00:01:59,430
and just kick back.

38
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:00,698
Now, peep this.

39
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:02,634
Leslie Knope has been meeting
with people

40
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:04,702
to try to sexy-up
her presentation.

41
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:06,704
So we had this far-out
brain tornado.

42
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:08,072
Good idea.

43
00:02:08,107 --> 00:02:11,075
We should get a brity to come
kick it with us small time,

44
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,810
and then just be like,
"Hey, chumps.

45
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:13,811
Let's get tight with Gryzz."

46
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,246
We need a celebrity.

47
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:17,282
As a minority owner,
it'll strengthen Gryzzl's bid.

48
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:21,686
Is a celebrity necessary?
I prefer quality over flash.

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,489
That's why I refuse to write
my signature in cursive.

50
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:26,658
Celebrities can help
with this kind of thing.

51
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:28,893
The Nets wouldn't be in Brooklyn
if it weren't for Jay-Z.

52
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:31,262
And the sales for Chick-fil-A
went through the roof

53
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:32,297
once Elton John bought 'em.

54
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,331
Exactly.

55
00:02:33,365 --> 00:02:35,033
Gryzzl is an outsider here
in Pawnee,

56
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,035
so a local celebrity
is gonna make everyone

57
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,703
feel more at ease with us.

58
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,939
And that's why we called on you
home court chillers

59
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:42,273
to frack your braniums.

60
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,876
Since we're locals, they want
us to think of ideas.

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,111
- I got it in context.
- Okay.

62
00:02:47,146 --> 00:02:50,648
I have no interest
in consorting with celebrities.

63
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:53,318
The only celebrities I recognize
are furniture maker

64
00:02:53,352 --> 00:02:56,020
Garry Knox Bennett,
designer of the notorious

65
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:59,223
16 Penny Nail Cabinet,
and Magnus,

66
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:02,760
the five-by-five bull elk I saw
near my cabin two years ago.

67
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:05,930
Took a shot at the bastard
and he stuck his antlers

68
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,832
through the door
of my meat shed.

69
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:11,669
One day, Magnus.
I will wear you as a jacket.

70
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:15,540
Have you thought about this.
You could be an airline pilot.

71
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:18,910
- I don't like heights.
- What about a submarine pilot?

72
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,179
- I don't like depths.
- Mm.

73
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:22,647
I don't like anything, okay.

74
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:23,915
You're not gonna be able
to find a career for me,

75
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:24,882
so just give up.

76
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,751
No way, babe.
We can do this.

77
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:28,152
Let's play a game.
Okay?

78
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,855
You say a word, I say a word.
We see if it makes a profession.

79
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:33,258
- Executive.
- Trampoline.

80
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:35,860
- Computer.
- Trampoline.

81
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:38,096
- Trampoline.
- Pass.

82
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,464
Hey, Leslie?

83
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:42,600
I need both you and Ron to sign
this city point of sale document

84
00:03:42,635 --> 00:03:45,336
since the land you're gunning
for lies within city limits.

85
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,338
Can we run over to Ron's office
and take care of this?

86
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:49,641
Well, I love it when you talk
point of sale doc,

87
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:51,676
'cause you know it turns me on,
but, no, no.

88
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,445
There's no way that I will be in
the same room with Ron Swanson,

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,382
unless it is during a police
lineup when I am pointing

90
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,983
him out as the man
who betrayed me.

91
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:00,919
That's him, officer.
Ronald Swanson.

92
00:04:00,953 --> 00:04:02,320
Thank you, Leslie.

93
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:03,755
That's the fifth crime you've
solved this month.

94
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:05,523
I'm not supposed to do this,
but let me give you a badge

95
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:06,791
and a siren for your car.

96
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:08,860
Could you please focus?
It'll take two minutes.

97
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:11,429
And all signatures need to be
notarized, and I really don't

98
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:14,466
want to have to schedule two
different notary appointments.

99
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,403
Uh, not to eavesdrop,
but I have a crazy story.

100
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:20,205
I recently had a bit
of a health scare,

101
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,472
just a couple weeks
in the hospital.

102
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:24,242
Oh, God.
This story's terrible so far.

103
00:04:24,276 --> 00:04:26,377
Anyway, I became really
motivated once I got out

104
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:29,247
to finally live life
to the fullest.

105
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:33,017
So... I fulfilled one of
my lifelong dreams.

106
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:35,253
And I became a notary public.

107
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:37,121
So if I go with you,
Ron and Leslie

108
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:38,389
can sign the document
separately.

109
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,325
Yeah, see?
Ben, it all works out.

110
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:43,561
I'll sign the documents here
and then you can bring it to Ron

111
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:45,430
and he can sign it there,
and then you can tell Ron

112
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:46,698
to rot in hell.

113
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:48,766
How long are you two gonna
go on like this?

114
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,235
You're acting like a little kid.

115
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,903
No, I'm not.

116
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:54,138
And infinity plus one year.

117
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:56,274
Andy?
Bring me the next person.

118
00:04:56,308 --> 00:05:00,378
Perd Hapley.
Crazy Ira and the Douche.

119
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:01,946
Tom Haverford?

120
00:05:01,981 --> 00:05:03,414
That's nice, but I don't know
if you can really consider me

121
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:04,582
a celebrity.

122
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:06,017
Yeah, that's your handwriting.

123
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,719
These are all great options,
but I think we need

124
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:10,955
to go after Pawnee's
biggest fish...

125
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,223
Annabel Porter from Bloosh.

126
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,691
That horrifying
lifestyle newsletter

127
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:16,861
filled with vegan recipes
and pointless tchotchkes?

128
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:19,197
Forget it.
That woman is my nightmare.

129
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,100
Um, she's a big deal, Ron.

130
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:25,270
Bloosh just won the Pulitzer
Prize for Best Top Ten Listicle

131
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:27,105
two years in a row.

132
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:28,540
Hi, Leslie.

133
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:31,309
Bill Haggerty from the Pawnee
Historical Society.

134
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:33,511
Oh, yes, Bill.
I remember you.

135
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:35,346
I heard you were looking
for information

136
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,816
on the Newport land, and I have
some very exciting news for you.

137
00:05:38,851 --> 00:05:42,220
It concerns William Henry
Harrison.

138
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:44,489
We claim William Henry
Harrison as a hero

139
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:45,690
because he was
the first governor

140
00:05:45,724 --> 00:05:46,925
of the Indiana territories,

141
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,127
and then President
of the United States.

142
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:50,662
We're also a little ashamed
of him

143
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:53,331
because he didn't wear a coat
at his inauguration,

144
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,467
caught a bad cold
and died 32 days later.

145
00:05:56,502 --> 00:05:58,169
He's an embarrassing footnote.

146
00:05:58,203 --> 00:06:00,705
But he's our embarrassing
footnote.

147
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:03,641
I've recently self-Published
a biography about Harrison

148
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:06,611
entitled, Barely A President.

149
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:10,114
William Henry Harrison's
32 Days In The White House."

150
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:11,983
I discovered that Harrison had

151
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:14,486
a heretofore
unknown hunting lodge

152
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,188
on the very land you're trying
to acquire.

153
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:20,425
Um, spoilers much?
Now I'll never read that book.

154
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:22,894
If a U.S. President had
a house on that land,

155
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,029
it could qualify for historic
landmark status,

156
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:27,065
and we could really stick it
to Ron's team.

157
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,299
Which would be icing
on the cake,

158
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,901
not the reason
why we're doing this.

159
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:31,803
Okay.
Show me this incredible lodge.

160
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:33,037
Let's go.

161
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:35,106
That book sounded so boring,
I cried a little.

162
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:37,709
Oh, babe.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

163
00:06:37,743 --> 00:06:39,043
You're safe now.

164
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:40,178
Hey, Ron.

165
00:06:40,212 --> 00:06:41,613
Sorry to bother you,
but I need you to sign

166
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,781
this point of sale document.

167
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:46,217
And please sign it in cursive.

168
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:47,819
It raises a lot of red flags
if you...

169
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,455
- No.
- Okay.

170
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:52,857
So...
what's Leslie up to?

171
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:54,559
Well, I don't think I should
discuss that,

172
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:56,227
given that you're in
competition.

173
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,997
- Need to remain neutral.
- Fair enough.

174
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,698
Terry, what's Leslie up to?

175
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:03,101
She is trying to find
a historical to earmark

176
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:04,102
the land for preservation.

177
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:05,637
Terry, come on, man.

178
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:08,473
Leslie, you little sneak.

179
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,775
If Leslie's going for a hook,
we should too.

180
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:14,412
Let's get Annabel Bloosh Person.
Yes!

181
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:15,947
Glad to see you
finally come around

182
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:17,215
after these two minutes
of insanity.

183
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:19,417
Now will you please consider
investing

184
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:21,719
in that toddler cologne
I've been bugging you about.

185
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:22,887
Toddler cologne.

186
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:25,290
Baby... tsst tsst...
you smell good.

187
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,327
Here we are.

188
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,697
Here we are, like, "Here's
the place where I buried the map

189
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,699
that will show us the way
to William Henry Harrison's

190
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,100
awesome hunting cabin?"

191
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:39,571
- No, this is all that's left.
- This place is awesome.

192
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:41,906
Hey, we should sell our dumb
house and buy this one.

193
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,676
Okay, you know, I love William
Henry Harrison as much,

194
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,479
if not slightly more than the
next guy, but this is garbage.

195
00:07:48,514 --> 00:07:51,149
I mean, literally, there's a bag
of old hamburgers over there.

196
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:53,985
What?
Ohh.

197
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:56,387
We're running out of time
and we need to beat Ron.

198
00:07:56,422 --> 00:08:00,325
So... we're gonna have to use
this old pile of bricks.

199
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,394
I need to gather everything
I can on William Henry Harrison.

200
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:06,397
Let's head to the Harrison
Museum over in Vincennes.

201
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:08,066
I volunteer there part time.

202
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,102
I just found an artifact!
Historical artifact.

203
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,471
William Henry Harrison's wig.

204
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:17,500
- Andy, put that down.
- Cool.

205
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:20,692
You've got to be kidding me.

206
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,876
No, I'm sorry, but there's
a page missing from the document

207
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,291
so then the signatures
are invalid.

208
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,259
Can't we just say it was there?

209
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:29,495
You're asking a notary to lie.

210
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:31,063
I signed an oath, Ben.

211
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:34,366
And then a different notary
notarized the oath I signed.

212
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,937
William Henry Harrison
is totally ridiculous.

213
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,106
They can't even fill a small
museum with real stuff

214
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,007
about his life because
he was so lame.

215
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:45,578
The "If He'd Worn A Coat Room"
explores how great America

216
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:49,515
would have been if Harrison had
worn a coat at his inauguration.

217
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:51,083
And not died.

218
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:52,585
This room is called

219
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,221
"Other Things That Were
Famous for One Month."

220
00:08:55,255 --> 00:09:00,292
Oh, and side note, admission
to this museum costs $14.

221
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:03,128
And while you're here,
why not visit

222
00:09:03,163 --> 00:09:06,165
the "Other Famous Harrisons"
exhibit.

223
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,135
Okay, guys, this is so great.

224
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:12,071
During the election campaign
of 1840, William Henry Harrison

225
00:09:12,105 --> 00:09:16,742
supporters rolled this ten foot
tin and paper ball

226
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:19,478
down country lanes all across
America.

227
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,514
And... And they would sing along
with a jug band,

228
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:23,015
and it was just so exciting.

229
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,583
People would come for miles
just to see it.

230
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:27,586
Why, was there something
inside this stupid ball?

231
00:09:27,621 --> 00:09:29,221
Ooh, like a giant hamster?

232
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:31,824
This is what we have
to work with, okay.

233
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,260
We are up against a very flashy
internet company,

234
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:37,129
and we should be aiming
for quantity over quality.

235
00:09:37,164 --> 00:09:39,932
So we're gonna throw a bunch
of Harrison facts at them

236
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:42,935
and a big pile of bricks
and whatever else we can find.

237
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:45,438
Quantity, people.
Quantity!

238
00:09:45,472 --> 00:09:47,706
Wow.

239
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:50,609
This is exactly what I imagine
Heaven looks like.

240
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:53,546
Right down to the unisex
linen tunics.

241
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,314
- Annabel, ma cherie.
- Hi.

242
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:57,249
I'm sorry I'm late
for our coven.

243
00:09:57,284 --> 00:10:00,453
I was polishing my oyster forks
with a cage-free olive oil rub.

244
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,087
Apology accepted, and then

245
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:05,057
I have no reaction
to anything else you said.

246
00:10:05,091 --> 00:10:07,993
I can't help but ask,
what's in right now?

247
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,196
Well, this season I'm intrigued

248
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,566
by... asymmetrical overalls,

249
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,836
angora toothbrushes,
and locally sourced

250
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,170
Italian flip flops.

251
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:21,540
Also, there's a flirty trend
in beverages.

252
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:23,709
So you've had soy milk
and almond milk.

253
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:29,348
Now try the hottest
new craze... beef milk.

254
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:33,786
It's like almond milk that's
been squeezed through tiny holes

255
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,089
in living cows.

256
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:38,524
It's fucking milk.

257
00:10:38,558 --> 00:10:41,026
- No.
- No.

258
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,528
Milk cost $3 a gallon.

259
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:43,883
Annabel's authentic,
hand-strained

260
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:45,531
teat-to-table beef milk,

261
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,900
that costs $60 a gallon.

262
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,436
Yeah, and there's a wait list.

263
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,838
This woman knows business.

264
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:55,141
And I'd be extremely jazzed
to be a part of the Gryzzl bid.

265
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:59,145
Shall we discuss it in my yurt?
Great.

266
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:03,149
Ron?
Okay, let's try this again.

267
00:11:03,183 --> 00:11:07,920
All pages accounted for,
just sign right here.

268
00:11:07,954 --> 00:11:10,055
How is Leslie doing
with her quest?

269
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,725
Again, I don't want to talk
about her plan with you,

270
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,260
nor yours with her.

271
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,428
- Sure you understand.
- Absolutely.

272
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:18,197
Terry, what is Leslie up to?

273
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:19,698
Oh, getting ready for a big
press conference.

274
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,400
Terry, come on.

275
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:22,668
A press conference.

276
00:11:22,702 --> 00:11:25,805
So she's found something
to strengthen her bid.

277
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,542
Ms. Porter,
no need to discuss any further.

278
00:11:29,576 --> 00:11:31,711
You will be the face
of the Gryzzl bid.

279
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,012
Smashing.

280
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:36,282
Well, this calls for a
celebratory dram of aged grappa.

281
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:37,650
- Okay, so I just sign here?
- No.

282
00:11:37,684 --> 00:11:39,552
No, no!
Aw.

283
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:42,455
Great.
There you go.

284
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:45,224
- Yeah, that's invalid now.
- Yeah, I know.

285
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:47,193
Excuse me, Mr. Haggerty?

286
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:49,795
I just wanted to say that
I really like your museum.

287
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,800
It's weird and sad
and unnecessary.

288
00:11:54,835 --> 00:12:00,372
Is there, like, a museum curator
position I could apply for?

289
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:03,476
Sorry, everyone here
is a volunteer.

290
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,511
Though you do get
a yearly stipend

291
00:12:05,545 --> 00:12:08,581
of 50,000 Harrison Bucks.

292
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:12,485
Accepted only
at that vending machine.

293
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:15,354
- Thanks.
- That's a bummer.

294
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:16,722
But, hey, hey, listen.

295
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:19,825
Maybe you could start
your own museum.

296
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,160
About what?

297
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:23,929
I'm sorry,
but I am not like you.

298
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,097
You love everything.

299
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:29,035
The only things I like are dogs,
sleeping late,

300
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,836
and weird birthmarks.

301
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:32,872
You can't make museums
about those.

302
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:34,673
- This is another dead end.
- Guys?

303
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,908
Let's keep it going, right?

304
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,309
Somebody grab
the reading glasses,

305
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:38,624
somebody grab
that walking stick.

306
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,279
Grab everything you can.

307
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:43,482
I'm officially dubbing this
Operation Quantity.

308
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:44,950
Oh, thank God you're still here.

309
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:48,020
I cannot believe the weird
notary hell

310
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:49,288
I've been trapped in.

311
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:51,357
Been more like heaven for me.
I mean, what a day.

312
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:53,592
- What's Ron up to?
- Okay, I am not...

313
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:55,227
- No, no, you have to tell me
because you legally vow yourself

314
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:56,228
to me in marriage.

315
00:12:56,263 --> 00:12:57,863
- Sucker.
- Okay, fine.

316
00:12:57,898 --> 00:12:59,899
They got Annabel Porter
to be the celebrity face

317
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:00,900
of their group.

318
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,134
Little rat.

319
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:03,803
Okay.
Two can play this game.

320
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:06,972
Bill?
Operation Quantity needs a face.

321
00:13:07,007 --> 00:13:08,607
Does William Henry Harrison
have any direct descendants

322
00:13:08,642 --> 00:13:09,842
in the area?

323
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:14,146
One... a distant nephew named
Zack Harrison.

324
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:16,816
This is our guy.
American royalty.

325
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,286
His veins pulse with the blood
of our storied forefather.

326
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,621
Zack Harrison?
I went to camp with this guy.

327
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:23,723
Ha ha!

328
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:25,257
No one would ride
in the boat with him

329
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,892
'cause he had terrible B.O.,
and then he went with Janine,

330
00:13:26,927 --> 00:13:28,828
our counselor, and he fell
asleep and got a boner.

331
00:13:28,862 --> 00:13:30,863
Well, he's
American royalty, okay?

332
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,198
And we need him for the press
conference, and we need

333
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:34,233
all of this stuff.

334
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:38,170
So help me God, I will make a
mountain out of this mole hill.

335
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:42,463
- Leslie, I do...
- Quantity, people.

336
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:47,890
Notary public's can trace
our origin all the way back

337
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:49,191
to ancient Rome.

338
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:50,993
- No way.
- Calvin Coolidge was a notary.

339
00:13:51,027 --> 00:13:52,327
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:13:52,362 --> 00:13:53,962
And so was Calvin Coolidge's dad

341
00:13:53,997 --> 00:13:56,331
and so was Calvin Coolidge's
paternal grandfather.

342
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:57,533
Uh-huh.

343
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,935
It's 2.5 pounds of pressure
is what you need

344
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,570
to get the perfect stamp.

345
00:14:01,604 --> 00:14:03,289
They have this monthly...

346
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,176
Well, it's a notary
email newsletter

347
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,144
and, oh, my gosh...

348
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,545
- All right.
- Ben, it's fun.

349
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,047
It's just fun.

350
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,242
Babe?

351
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:12,153
I have been thinking a lot about
what you said.

352
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:15,309
I made a list of everything
that I know you like.

353
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:17,278
Playing with our dog,
staring contests,

354
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:19,179
sex with me, et cetera.

355
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:21,815
And then, I lost the list.

356
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,450
So I had to make a new list.

357
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:25,286
I didn't have any paper,
so I wrote it on my leg.

358
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,755
And that's when my leg fell
asleep...

359
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,757
- Okay, could you just skip
ahead a little?

360
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,192
What do all the things on
that list have in common?

361
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:34,295
They're one-on-one.

362
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:38,999
You like dealing with people,
or dogs, one-on-one.

363
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:41,802
See, we don't make a list
of the things that you love,

364
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:44,438
we make a list of the reasons
why you love them.

365
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:47,441
And then we find something
that fits that list.

366
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:49,643
You're the best husband ever.

367
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:54,748
Hi, Zack Harrison.

368
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:56,450
You wanted to meet with me about
a press conference?

369
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:57,685
Oh, yes.
Hello, Zack.

370
00:14:57,719 --> 00:14:59,954
Yes, I am Leslie.
It is an honor to have you here.

371
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:03,390
You are Indiana's last living
link to this great man.

372
00:15:03,425 --> 00:15:04,591
Look, I really don't think

373
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,493
you should make a big deal
out of this.

374
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:08,662
I just happen to be
a descendant of a guy.

375
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:10,431
You could be the descendant
of George Washington.

376
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:11,966
- I wouldn't know.
- Do you...

377
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,167
- No, that was just
a hypothetical.

378
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:14,301
Could that be possible?

379
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:15,402
Because, you know,
I have always thought

380
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:18,138
that we shared very similar
jaw lines.

381
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:19,807
Wow.
That is something to chew on.

382
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:21,342
Anyway, okay.
It doesn't matter.

383
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,043
I need this to be
very impressive.

384
00:15:23,078 --> 00:15:27,214
So head on in there and be
presidential... ly descendant.

385
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,482
Just go in there.
Okay?

386
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:29,583
- Just walk, walk, walk.
- I don't...

387
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:31,118
- Quiet down.
Walk in.

388
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,120
Zack.
Camp Wamapo, you got a boner.

389
00:15:33,154 --> 00:15:35,089
We'll catch up.
What a dick.

390
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,725
Hey!
No.

391
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,927
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What... Ron?

392
00:15:39,961 --> 00:15:41,028
What are you doing here?

393
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:42,462
Setting up for our
press conference,

394
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:44,531
which will take place
immediately after yours.

395
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:46,133
Are you crazy?
You can't do that.

396
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:47,735
- Do you want me to bite him?
- No.

397
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,503
Ignore them.

398
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:51,972
We start in ten minutes.

399
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,942
Swanson, you didn't say
anything about ambushing

400
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:56,577
Leslie's press conference.

401
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:57,911
I didn't think it was relevant.

402
00:15:57,946 --> 00:15:59,813
Come on, man.
This isn't cool.

403
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:02,550
This is a competition.
We need to win it.

404
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:05,252
Please do your jobs.

405
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,620
Good evening.

406
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,523
Pawnee is a place of culture,
history, and heritage,

407
00:16:09,557 --> 00:16:11,692
and the National Park Service
is proud to say

408
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:13,994
that we've discovered a new
chapter in the life

409
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:17,097
of local hero and president,
William Henry Harrison.

410
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:18,899
A heretofore unknown

411
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:22,069
hunting lodge was recently
discovered

412
00:16:22,103 --> 00:16:25,372
smack dab in the middle
of the Newport land.

413
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:28,108
What great historical moments

414
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:30,477
took place within
these hallowed halls?

415
00:16:30,512 --> 00:16:33,647
Did Harrison plan his
presidential campaign

416
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:35,349
while sitting around the hearth?

417
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:37,117
Which used to be there.

418
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:38,953
Did he write letters
to Thomas Jefferson

419
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:40,321
on his roll top desk?

420
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:42,389
Which, you know, I don't know,
might have existed.

421
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:45,025
The point is,
William Henry Harrison

422
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,230
would have wanted this land
preserved as a national park.

423
00:16:49,264 --> 00:16:51,599
Don't believe me?
Let's ask him.

424
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:56,403
In the form of his direct
descendant, Zachary.

425
00:16:58,673 --> 00:17:02,209
Hi, I'm Zack.
Harrison.

426
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:03,510
Amazing.

427
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,446
Zachary, what is it like being
a descendant

428
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,348
of William Henry Harrison?

429
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,717
Uh, Harrison's
a pretty common last name.

430
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,785
Okay, sit.
Now.

431
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,755
Travel back in time with me
to 1840

432
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:17,358
when William Henry Harrison,
Old Tippecanoe,

433
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:18,859
runs for president.

434
00:17:18,894 --> 00:17:23,864
And his campaign rolls this
giant tin and paper ball

435
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:28,035
from town to town, while
Americans everywhere sing along.

436
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,069

Said some boring idiot
from 200 years ago.

449
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:02,169
Who cares about some dumb
grandpa and a tin ball?

450
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:04,371
That's the past.
Gryzzl is the future.

451
00:18:04,406 --> 00:18:07,408
The Newport land will become
the Midwest headquarters

452
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:10,044
of America's most dynamic
technology company.

453
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:13,714
Here to introduce our vision
is Annabel Riordan from Bloosh

454
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:15,649
and the sexy ladies
known in Pawnee as

455
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:19,353
The Somebody's Daughter Dancers.

456
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:22,389
Fresh.

457
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:25,392
Innovative.
Place-Making.

458
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:29,163
Disposable duvets.
Growth-Hacking.

459
00:18:29,197 --> 00:18:31,932
Super-Moon
Gryzzl.

460
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:37,438
Now come with me as we binge
watch the future.

461
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:44,178
That was sickening.
All flash and no substance.

462
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:47,148
It was exactly as substantive
as your presentation.

463
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:48,582
No, it was not.

464
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:50,451
We had way more quantity
than you.

465
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:52,319
Please.
Please.

466
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:55,322
For the love of all
that is holy, both of you,

467
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:58,926
please sign this form.

468
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,094
Not that it matters.

469
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:01,629
I'm definitely gonna wake up
tomorrow morning

470
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:04,465
with these same forms for you
to sign because I've died

471
00:19:04,499 --> 00:19:07,668
somehow and now I'm a ghost
living in Purgatory

472
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:09,803
until I complete
my unfinished business.

473
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:11,572
Okay, I'm not signing anything
he's signing.

474
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:13,841
Did you just hear what I said?

475
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,310
No, of course, you didn't,
because I'm a ghost.

476
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:18,545
You know what?
I can't stand you.

477
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,483
I can't stand your stupid
mustache and your stupid shirt,

478
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,718
and your stupid name, Ron.

479
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:26,720
Ron.
It's not even a word.

480
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:27,888
Well, I have had
just about enough

481
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:30,090
of your stubborn behavior.

482
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,692
Ever since
the Morningstar incident,

483
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:33,794
you have been completely
unreasonable.

484
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,262
You are the unreasonable one!

485
00:19:35,297 --> 00:19:37,665
You've been unreasonable
way before Morningstar.

486
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:40,067
You're the most unreasonable,
stubborn person I have ever met.

487
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:41,769
And I am never gonna change
my mind on that,

488
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:45,239
no matter what anybody says!

489
00:19:45,273 --> 00:19:47,575
You're not that good
at scrapbooking.

490
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,519
What?

491
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:53,914
Okay, would you just sign
right here?

492
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:56,216
And I will need your
thumbprints.

493
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:01,773
Man, those two really
hate each other.

494
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,908
That feud's like
Biggie-Tupac level.

495
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:06,277
Maybe even Morgan Freeman-
Shailene Woodley level.

496
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:08,279
Nah, it's bad,
but it's not that bad.

497
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:11,349
This is like when the triplets
fight, except I can't just give

498
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:14,986
Leslie and Ron stuffed animals
to make them calm down.

499
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,455
Actually, that might work.
Have we tried that?

500
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:18,823
They've always butted heads.

501
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:20,658
I really... I don't think
they hate each other.

502
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:23,695
I just think they're very
different people and they just

503
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:26,049
drifted apart once they stopped
working in the same office.

504
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,935
You okay?

505
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,805
Yeah, well I ordered 60
veggie pizzas to Ron's office,

506
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,206
so that calmed me down a little.

507
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:38,743
I know you're furious at him.

508
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:42,680
But please, come to a neutral
site and sit with Ron

509
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:45,750
for 30 seconds so I can get
this dumb document signed.

510
00:20:45,784 --> 00:20:47,152
Ugh.

511
00:20:47,186 --> 00:20:48,586
I'll let you rename the triplets

512
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:51,322
Ruth, Bader, and Ginsburg.

513
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:54,592
Okay, fine.
But I get to sign first.

514
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:55,760
Oh, my God.

515
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:57,562
All right, let's just
get this over with.

516
00:20:57,596 --> 00:20:59,030
Oh, let me get that for you.

517
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,938
- Got 'em.
- What?

518
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,740
What's going on?
What's going on?

519
00:21:08,774 --> 00:21:11,109
- Let us out immediately.
- No.

520
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:12,644
You guys are being ridiculous.

521
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:15,547
This has gone too far, and
you are not leaving this office

522
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:18,983
until you've made peace.

523
00:21:19,018 --> 00:21:20,952
Nooo!

524
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:25,657
No, no, no.

525
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,959
Sorry, Ron, doors are locked.

526
00:21:27,993 --> 00:21:30,028
We've taken your key cards
and your phones,

527
00:21:30,062 --> 00:21:31,863
and the automatic timer
won't go off

528
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:33,431
until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.

529
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,465
You're trapped in there.

530
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,867
We told security
not to disturb you

531
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:37,969
under any circumstances.

532
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:39,070
And the phones and internet?

533
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:40,304
Oh, they've been disconnected.

534
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,807
And I left a rusty hacksaw
on the table,

535
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:45,443
so the first person who hacks
their face off gets release.

536
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:46,945
That's not... what?

537
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:48,212
Is that true?

538
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:50,548
Guys, this is insane, okay?
Let us out.

539
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,584
Oh, my God, babe.
Game of Thrones is on tonight.

540
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:53,985
It's the series finale.

541
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:56,387
Khaleesi is marrying
Jack Sparrow.

542
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:58,723
Oh, God, that show has really
gone off the rails.

543
00:21:58,757 --> 00:22:00,325
It makes sense
if you've read the books.

544
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,560
Look, our baby monitor
is on the table.

545
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:04,462
If you guys can talk this out

546
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:06,898
and settle your differences
like grown-ups,

547
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:09,767
turn it on, and I will come
to get you from my office.

548
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:12,937
Otherwise, we will see you
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

549
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:14,739
I am going to break out of here,

550
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:17,075
then I am going to snap you
in half.

551
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,076
Hey.

552
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,777
This is not his fault, Swanson.

553
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:22,313
Be a man,
and get your house in order.

554
00:22:22,348 --> 00:22:24,148
You too, Knope.

555
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:25,383
Good luck, you guys.

556
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:27,252
I really hope you can work out
your differences.

557
00:22:27,286 --> 00:22:29,354
Terry, look at me.

558
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:31,422
Is this what you want to do?

559
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:34,759
Think very carefully, son.

560
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:36,060
There you go.

561
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:37,462
That's right, buddy.

562
00:22:37,496 --> 00:22:38,863
Come on.

563
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:41,733
For once in your life,
do something right.

564
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:43,234
Stop it, Terry.

565
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,802
Both of you.
Come on.

566
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:46,371
Damn it, Terry!

567
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:08,393
Okay, think.

568
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:09,928
There must be a way out of here.

569
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:11,362
I don't think there is.

570
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,565
They installed these magnetic
locks two years ago.

571
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,066
There's no way around them.

572
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,467
Yes, there is.

573
00:23:16,502 --> 00:23:18,536
I'll simply punch my fist
through a window.

574
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,605
Ron, there's security wire
in there.

575
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,040
You'll slice your arm open.

576
00:23:22,074 --> 00:23:23,875
I would rather bleed out
than sit here

577
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:26,544
and talk about my feelings
for ten hours.

578
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,512
There is another way.

579
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:29,080
We'll just wait a few minutes,

580
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:31,883
turn on this monitor,
and then we'll tell Ben

581
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,818
that we talked it out
and made up.

582
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:36,821
I'll just tell them that
I apologized for...

583
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:39,491
whatever,
heroically caring too much,

584
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,459
and you admitted that
you're a stubborn butthead,

585
00:23:41,494 --> 00:23:42,627
and everything's fine now.

586
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:44,796
Why do I have to be stubborn?

587
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,298
Why can't the problem have been
that I was reasonable

588
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,366
and you were at fault?

589
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,435
Because we want them
to believe us

590
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:51,903
and not laugh really hard

591
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:54,405
at a ridiculous
science fiction scenario.

592
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,274
We are not saying
I was the problem.

593
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:59,043
If we're gonna lie to them,
I will not let you lie to them.

594
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:00,278
Fine!

595
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:01,479
I'll tell them
that for the past three years,

596
00:24:01,514 --> 00:24:03,281
you've been a perfect gentleman
and scholar,

597
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:04,816
and I am an insane weirdo

598
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,351
who, despite being
the only reason

599
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:08,419
we even had a friendship
to begin with,

600
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:12,090
decided to ruin it out of
the blue for no good reason.

601
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:13,658
That sounds good.
Let's go with that.

602
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:16,661
What are you doing?

603
00:24:16,695 --> 00:24:17,862
I destroyed the monitor!

604
00:24:17,897 --> 00:24:19,297
What if we have an emergency

605
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:20,665
and have to get out of here?

606
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:23,501
I did not consider
that possibility!

607
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:29,874
Everything's different.

608
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,011
I mean, the furniture,
the pictures.

609
00:24:33,045 --> 00:24:34,979
Craig changed everything.

610
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:35,947
Did he?

611
00:24:35,981 --> 00:24:37,181
I tried not to notice anything

612
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:38,716
when I worked here.

613
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:40,018
Or talk to anyone.

614
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:41,786
Or learn anyone's name.

615
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:44,289
You, of all people,
should know that, Lauren.

616
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:47,158
Look, we are gonna be here
for ten hours.

617
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:48,660
We could either
talk about our issues

618
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:49,894
and work through our problems,

619
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:51,529
or we can just sit here
doing nothing.

620
00:24:51,564 --> 00:24:52,764
I choose "sit here."

621
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:54,165
Come on, Ron,
why don't we just...

622
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,733
- Sit here.
- Ron.

623
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:58,570
Sit here.

624
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:00,505
I bet I can make you talk.

625
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,006
I'll take that bet

626
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,042
at any odds,
for any amount of money,

627
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:05,410
over any length of time

628
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:08,980
stretching from now
into infinity.

629
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:10,281
Talk to me. Talk to me.
Talk to me. Talk to me.

630
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:11,449
Talk to me. Talk to me.
Talk to me. Talk to me.

631
00:25:11,483 --> 00:25:12,584
Talk to me. Talk. Talk. Talk.

632
00:25:14,353 --> 00:25:15,453
Talk to me!

633
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:19,757
Drip. Drip.
One word, and this is over.

634
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,993
I think wood is stupid,
and so does everybody else.

635
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:24,996
You guys, Ron loves plastic.

636
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,931
Last chance, Ron.

637
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:29,234
You want to talk? Huh?

638
00:25:31,237 --> 00:25:32,270
Aha!

639
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:34,038
Jackpot.

640
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:35,340
You know what this is, Ron?

641
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:39,210
This is a mix I made for
the summer Parks barbecue, 2007.

642
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:40,806
I asked everyone
in the Parks Department

643
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:42,180
to choose one song.

644
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:45,483
You chose Buddy
by Willie Nelson,

645
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:48,219
a fact I remember
because my mind

646
00:25:48,254 --> 00:25:50,355
is a steel trap
of friendship nuggets.

647
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:52,991
But I am not going to play
your choice.

648
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:54,826
I'm gonna play Jerry's choice.

649
00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:58,129
Ooh, that's right.

650
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,597
And I'm gonna sing along.

651
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:02,700
And I'm gonna maintain
eye contact the whole time.

652
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:05,503

Do you want to hear it again,
or do you want to talk?

664
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:23,588
No?

Great.

674
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:42,373
So...

675
00:26:42,408 --> 00:26:43,908
what would you like
to talk about?

676
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:44,909
Oh, come on, Ron.

677
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:46,077
We were friends for ten years.

678
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:48,079
We were work proximity
associates.

679
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:49,280
We were friends.

680
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:50,548
And now we're not.

681
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:54,118
And once again, it is up to me
to save our friendship,

682
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:56,754
and I will do so using
the most powerful tool

683
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,490
known to man:

684
00:26:58,524 --> 00:27:02,293
a well-organized chart.

685
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:05,630
Three years ago, I accept
a job at National Parks.

686
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:07,699
You and I see each other less,
admittedly,

687
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:08,800
due to my busy schedule

688
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,468
and your utter lack of interest

689
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,970
in maintaining
adult friendships.

690
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:14,472
Work proximity
associate-ships.

691
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,348
Three months later,
April comes to work for me.

692
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,342
We throw her a party.

693
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,910
At her request,
the party's theme

694
00:27:18,944 --> 00:27:21,546
is "Zombie Teenage Biker Gang
Pizza Jamboree."

695
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,514
I remember.

696
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:24,149
You made me wear
a leather jacket.

697
00:27:24,183 --> 00:27:25,917
That is the last time
you and I see each other

698
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:27,819
for more than five minutes.

699
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:30,188
Three months later,
you come and visit me

700
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:33,558
at my office on the third floor
for the very first time.

701
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:36,494
One week later,
I return from a trip,

702
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,964
and I find out you have quit
the Parks Department

703
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:42,467
and you have started
your own building company

704
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:45,270
without even bothering
to tell me.

705
00:27:45,304 --> 00:27:46,905
"Oh, well," I think to myself.

706
00:27:46,939 --> 00:27:48,439
"You know, it was only
a matter of time."

707
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:51,075
And then, two months after that,

708
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,011
Morningstar...

709
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:54,212
the final twist of the knife.

710
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,547
Oh, for God's sake.

711
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:56,714
I hear about Morningstar,

712
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:59,551
and I calmly saunter
down to your office

713
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:01,945
and attempt to have a rational
discussion with you about it.

714
00:28:01,954 --> 00:28:04,155
What the hell, Ron?

715
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,024
You're building
your stupid building

716
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,059
on the block
next to Pawnee Commons?

717
00:28:08,093 --> 00:28:10,862
The park that I built
from scratch out of a pit?

718
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,831
This building is gonna ruin
the views, you jerk.

719
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:15,166
And you're gonna tear
all the houses down?

720
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:18,102
- Yes.
- Ann lived there, Ron.

721
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:19,404
That's Ann's old house.

722
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:21,339
That's my best friend's
old house.

723
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:23,608
That was the house
where I put on my wedding dress

724
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:24,642
the night I got married.

725
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:26,411
That is the house where
April and Andy

726
00:28:26,445 --> 00:28:27,645
met for the first time.

727
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,547
That is the house
where Ann gave me

728
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,716
my first ever smoky eye look.

729
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,952
She hasn't lived there
for five years.

730
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:35,120
That's not the point.

731
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:37,689
This building is a monstrosity.

732
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:40,358
And what's it called?
Morningstar?

733
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:41,626
"Oh, dear.

734
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,828
"We live at the Morningstar.

735
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:46,564
That's so posh and
hibbley-fibbley-gibbley."

736
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,000
The world needs
apartment buildings.

737
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:50,502
The park you built is nice,

738
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:51,836
and people want to live
next to it.

739
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:53,204
That's not the point.

740
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,173
You knew that
I would be furious,

741
00:28:55,207 --> 00:28:57,909
and you didn't have the guts
to tell me yourself.

742
00:28:57,943 --> 00:29:00,278
Enjoy your new job, Judas.

743
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:04,115
You tear down Ann's house.

744
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,584
You spend the next two years
cutting down trees

745
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,121
and fighting zoning laws
that I helped pass,

746
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:14,058
basically spitting on everything
we did together at Parks.

747
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:17,629
That's not the whole story.

748
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:18,797
What does that mean?

749
00:29:18,831 --> 00:29:20,065
It means what it means.

750
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:21,299
That...

751
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:24,602
is not the whole story
of why I left.

752
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:29,140
Sorry, time is up.

753
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:30,141
Wait.

754
00:29:30,175 --> 00:29:32,076
Why then?
What was the reason?

755
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:33,178
Ron, come on.

756
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:34,612
Oh, my God, you made a key?

757
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,847
Ron, please, don't...

758
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:37,115
Come on, Ron.

759
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:38,816
Ron, just talk to me.

760
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:39,818
Ron, come on.

761
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:43,521
See you tomorrow morning.

762
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:44,989
Okay.

763
00:29:45,024 --> 00:29:46,024
Progress.

764
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,360
Is it that I sent you
a birthday card

765
00:29:49,394 --> 00:29:50,661
through the US mail,

766
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:52,663
so the post office
knew your address?

767
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:53,864
No. Go away.

768
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:56,566
Ooh, is it because
I had Food and Stuff

769
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,114
temporarily shut down
due to a health code violation?

770
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:00,670
That was you?

771
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,007
They had fresh produce out
right next to the roach spray.

772
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:08,478
The name of the store
is "Food and Stuff."

773
00:30:08,512 --> 00:30:10,513
They sell food,
and they sell stuff.

774
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,782
If you don't like it,
go to that new place,

775
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:14,183
Complete Food.

776
00:30:14,218 --> 00:30:16,419
It's called Whole Foods.

777
00:30:16,453 --> 00:30:18,521
- And is that really the reason?
- No.

778
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:21,924
How many more questions
are you going to ask me?

779
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:24,727
As many as I need to
to solve this mystery

780
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:29,198
and get us engaged in a deep
and stimulating conversation

781
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,800
about our friendship.

782
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:31,801
Ron, what are you doing?

783
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:32,969
I know I saw it.

784
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:34,036
Aha!

785
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:36,572
Detonator.

786
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:38,841
The partially defused
claymore mine

787
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:40,710
you gave me ten years ago.

788
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:43,312
I'm gonna use it to blow
a hole in this damn door

789
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:44,914
so I can get out of here.

790
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:48,084
- Ron, just wait a second.
- No.

791
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:49,652
I'm being held as a prisoner
against my will,

792
00:30:49,686 --> 00:30:52,355
and I have the right, as
a citizen of the United States,

793
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:54,957
to blow a hole
in that fucking door

794
00:30:54,992 --> 00:30:56,692
and walk out as a free man.

795
00:30:56,727 --> 00:30:58,161
It's in the Constitution.

796
00:30:58,195 --> 00:30:59,929
There's no cursing
in the Constitution.

797
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:01,931
Look, before you do that...

798
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:03,533
- Too late.
Here we go.

799
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:06,502
Fire in the hole!

800
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,140
Whoo!

801
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,812
I gave you that as a gift

802
00:31:15,846 --> 00:31:18,014
on your fifth anniversary
as Parks director.

803
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:20,249
You told me

804
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:23,953
this was a genuine partially
defused claymore mine.

805
00:31:23,987 --> 00:31:25,388
Well, it was.

806
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:28,024
I bought the empty shell
off of eBay,

807
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:29,592
and then I filled it
with, you know,

808
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,494
balloons and confetti and such.

809
00:31:31,528 --> 00:31:34,197
You mean to tell me
I have had a toy

810
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:36,599
on my desk for ten years?

811
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,034
You mean to tell me
you've thought

812
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:41,003
you've thought you had an actual
land mine on your desk?

813
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:42,805
Congratulations, Ron.

814
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,274
You've been doing
an explosive job!

815
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:49,178
Come on, Ron.

816
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:50,146
It's funny stuff.

817
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,615
Who gets angry at balloons?

818
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:53,983
Good talk.

819
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:00,123
What's all this?

820
00:32:00,157 --> 00:32:02,592
I'm just reading back through
some of our old projects,

821
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:06,095
trying to figure out what
happened that made you quit.

822
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,296
Good God, woman.

823
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:09,198
This is a code.

824
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:11,200
I am going to break it.

825
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:14,437
And this is my best shot.

826
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:16,038
Is that nuclear waste?

827
00:32:16,073 --> 00:32:18,741
No, this is my job application
from when you hired me.

828
00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:19,909
How did you get that?

829
00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:22,378
Freedom of Information Act
request.

830
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:23,946
But here's the thing.
I've never read it.

831
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:25,915
This application contains

832
00:32:25,949 --> 00:32:28,584
your very first impressions
of me.

833
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:30,686
It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron.

834
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:33,356
The beginning of
the whole shebang.

835
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:36,859
This is all you wrote?

836
00:32:36,894 --> 00:32:38,060
Three lousy lines?

837
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:40,396
Why would anyone need
more than three lines?

838
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:43,266
I'm describing a person,
not something complicated

839
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,369
like a wooden sailing ship
or proper dovetail technique.

840
00:32:46,403 --> 00:32:47,770
I forgot what I wrote.

841
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:49,105
Can I hear it?

842
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:50,773
Why don't you read it yourself?

843
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:53,276
"Leslie Knope
is an absurd idealist

844
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,343
"whose political leanings

845
00:32:54,378 --> 00:32:56,979
are slightly to the left
of Leon Trotsky."

846
00:32:57,014 --> 00:32:59,015
So far, so accurate.

847
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:00,283
"If we were to work together,

848
00:33:00,317 --> 00:33:02,085
"she would undoubtedly
drive me insane,

849
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,154
and it is possible that
we would murder each other."

850
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:09,585
You forgot the last sentence.

851
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:10,560
No, I didn't.

852
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:13,029
I remember that part.

853
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:15,765
It says, "Hire her."

854
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:17,900
Did you hear that?

855
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,535
Oh, it's...
it's a person.

856
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,070
It's another person!

857
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,438
Hello! Hello!

858
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:24,540
- Janitor!
- Hey!

859
00:33:24,575 --> 00:33:26,242
- Hey, we're trapped in here!
- Hey!

860
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:30,346
♪ The best thing
about being a woman ♪

861
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:31,681
♪ Is the prerogative ♪

862
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:32,815
Please, Mr. Janitor.

863
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,817
If you just look over here
for two seconds,

864
00:33:34,852 --> 00:33:35,785
I'll do anything.

865
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:36,853
Hey!

866
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:37,887
I'll watch a foreign film.

867
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:39,989
I'll talk to a man
with a ponytail.

868
00:33:40,023 --> 00:33:43,626
Oh, he's gone, Ron.
He's gone.

869
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:47,764
Why did you give me the job?

870
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:48,831
And that's what I don't get.

871
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:50,266
We should've never
worked together.

872
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,534
Why did you hire me?

873
00:33:51,568 --> 00:33:53,169
Because of your interview.

874
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:54,971
Okay, that doesn't make
any sense.

875
00:33:55,005 --> 00:33:57,106
I mean,
I remember that interview.

876
00:33:57,141 --> 00:33:59,976
You were wearing
that exact outfit.

877
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,945
And you said to me, "Ms. Knope,
I have one question for you.

878
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,448
What do you believe the role
of government is in America?"

879
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:07,250
You blathered on for ten minutes

880
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:10,653
about social safety nets
and honest governance

881
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:12,155
and improving lives.

882
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:13,523
Basic nonsense.

883
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,877
Then you said, "Everything
that just came out of your mouth

884
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:17,226
"is basic nonsense.

885
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:18,194
Good day."

886
00:34:18,228 --> 00:34:19,328
And that was it.

887
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:21,197
No, that was not it.

888
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:22,632
After I said
you were full of it,

889
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,134
you got very angry
and scrunched up your face

890
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:28,004
and said, "Excuse me, sir,
but I disagree."

891
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:31,441
Did you let me have it.

892
00:34:31,475 --> 00:34:33,743
That was one of
your top ten tirades, I'd say.

893
00:34:33,777 --> 00:34:35,912
You were pounding your fist
and shaking.

894
00:34:35,946 --> 00:34:37,814
You called me a heartless thug.

895
00:34:37,848 --> 00:34:39,449
I most certainly did not.

896
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:41,984
You were tough and honest,

897
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:43,886
and you stood up
for what you believed in,

898
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:46,522
even though it might've killed
your chance to get the job.

899
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:48,891
I would rather work
with a person like that

900
00:34:48,926 --> 00:34:52,762
than with
a milquetoast yes-man.

901
00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:54,797
Should be one more thing
in that file.

902
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:56,499
Aw, it's the thank-you note
I wrote to you

903
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:57,700
after the interview.

904
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:58,735
You kept it.

905
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,570
"Dear Mr. Swanson,
I'm sorry

906
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:02,738
"for raising my voice
in the interview,

907
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:04,533
and I'm sorry
I called you a heartless thug."

908
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,209
Oh, well, okay.
There you go.

909
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:07,877
"If it matters,
I promise I would never

910
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:10,246
raise my voice at you
if we worked together."

911
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,347
Liar.

912
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:13,583
Yeah, I was being
really optimistic.

913
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:15,318
"Please enjoy
these homemade brownies

914
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:16,486
"as a gesture of goodwill.

915
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,354
Leslie Knope."

916
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:20,923
That was the real reason
I hired you.

917
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:23,326
Those brownies were damn good.

918
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,661
Ron, look how far we've come.

919
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,363
We're doing so great.

920
00:35:27,398 --> 00:35:28,798
Let's just bring it home, okay?

921
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:30,166
Let's just talk about
our issues.

922
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,701
- Leslie, don't push it.
- Okay, fine.

923
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:34,604
If I guess and guess right,
you have to tell me.

924
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:36,506
Ready?

925
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,842
Two years ago, you found out
you were 1/4 French,

926
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:41,244
and you had a nervous breakdown.

927
00:35:41,278 --> 00:35:44,247
Okay, playtime is over.

928
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:46,382
I'm getting out of here
once and for all.

929
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,483
No, Ron! God, no!

930
00:35:49,853 --> 00:35:52,455
That alarm is just
for sprinklers.

931
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,556
April kept pulling it,

932
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,758
so the fire department
disconnected it.

933
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:56,993
I see.

934
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:06,105
Ron? I found some towels.

935
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,941
You okay?

936
00:36:08,976 --> 00:36:10,775
Wow.

937
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:13,294
Apparently,
Craig is studying yoga.

938
00:36:13,648 --> 00:36:15,649
These are the only
dry clothes I could find.

939
00:36:15,684 --> 00:36:17,385
Well, you look great.

940
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:18,586
I feel extremely angry.

941
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,054
Oh, come on.

942
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:21,555
Stop whining, you big baby.

943
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,624
I've seen you
with your eyebrows blown off.

944
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:25,292
I've seen you
without a mustache.

945
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:26,360
I've seen it all.

946
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:27,661
There's nowhere to run, Ron.

947
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:30,264
You have tried every possible
means of escape.

948
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:32,700
There's nothing to do but talk.

949
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:33,868
What happened

950
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:37,538
to these "workplace proximity
associates"?

951
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:38,706
Hmm?

952
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,342
Spill it.

953
00:36:41,376 --> 00:36:43,911
You left.

954
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:46,580
Then a month later,
you took Terry with you.

955
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:48,382
Yeah, well, we needed
a mindless factotum,

956
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,084
and he's the best there is.

957
00:36:50,118 --> 00:36:52,520
Amen.

958
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:54,956
Then you took April.

959
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,591
I didn't want her to go,
as she had become

960
00:36:57,626 --> 00:37:00,961
one of my closest
workplace acquaintances.

961
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:02,797
But your offer was too good
to pass up,

962
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:04,732
so I didn't try to stop her.

963
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,234
Then Tom left
to run his business.

964
00:37:07,269 --> 00:37:09,103
Donna left to run hers.

965
00:37:09,137 --> 00:37:11,105
One day, I looked up.

966
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:13,407
Just didn't recognize anyone.

967
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:16,310
So I made a decision.

968
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:18,546
An unthinkable decision.

969
00:37:20,215 --> 00:37:21,148
Hey.

970
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:22,616
Well, my, my, my.

971
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:23,651
Do my eyes deceive me?

972
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:25,319
Is that Ron Swanson?

973
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:27,121
Hello, Leslie.

974
00:37:27,155 --> 00:37:28,356
Hello, April. Larry.

975
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,357
It's Terry now.

976
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:30,624
Okay.

977
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:32,159
- As luck would have it...
- One second. Oh.

978
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:33,727
Did you talk to Randy
about the vote?

979
00:37:33,762 --> 00:37:35,863
Tell the Northeast that
we need to put pressure on them,

980
00:37:35,897 --> 00:37:37,198
or else we're gonna be waiting
forever,

981
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:38,499
and I'm tired of waiting
on them, okay?

982
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:39,900
Sorry.
This is a crazy day.

983
00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:41,296
So what's up with you,
you big lug?

984
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:42,436
Nothing important.

985
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:44,772
Just thought you might want
to have lunch.

986
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,207
- Tomorrow?
- I would love to.

987
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:49,176
It's been too long.
JJ's Diner, 12:30?

988
00:37:49,211 --> 00:37:51,145
- Excellent. See you then.
- Okay.

989
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:53,614
So Randy says
the House is voting tomorrow,

990
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:55,449
and they need us in Washington
to prep.

991
00:37:55,484 --> 00:37:56,584
Oh, my God, really?

992
00:37:56,618 --> 00:37:58,152
Okay, get us the first flight
out of here

993
00:37:58,186 --> 00:37:59,220
and grab the Missouri files.

994
00:37:59,254 --> 00:38:01,155
Meet me at my car.

995
00:38:01,189 --> 00:38:03,624
Hey, babe.
I got to go to Washington.

996
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:05,493
Can you pick up the kids?

997
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:07,294
Oh. Oh, no.

998
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,530
Ron, I stood you up for lunch.

999
00:38:09,564 --> 00:38:11,198
You did, yes.

1000
00:38:11,233 --> 00:38:13,167
I waited for a while,
but it was pretty easy

1001
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,635
to figure out what had happened.

1002
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,004
Your life seemed pretty hectic.

1003
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,006
Is that the rest of the story?

1004
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:21,308
That I stood you up?

1005
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:25,146
You were going to ask me
something.

1006
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,114
That's why you wanted
to have lunch.

1007
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:30,251
Ron, you were going...

1008
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:34,088
- I was gonna ask you for a job.

1009
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:36,390
In the federal government.

1010
00:38:36,425 --> 00:38:38,859
Just saying it out loud
feels dirty.

1011
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,997
You missed your friends,

1012
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,965
and you wanted to come up
to the third floor

1013
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,467
and work with us again.

1014
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:50,538
I can't even imagine how hard
that must have been for you.

1015
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:52,506
God, why didn't I see that?

1016
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,443
Ron, I am so sorry.

1017
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:57,678
I should've been
a better friend to you.

1018
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,448
Honestly, Leslie, it's fine.

1019
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:03,184
It was a punctuation mark
on a sentence

1020
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,418
that had already been written.

1021
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:06,687
My time in
government work was over.

1022
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:08,322
Sure, I loved
shutting things down

1023
00:39:08,357 --> 00:39:11,158
and bleeding the rotting beast
from the inside.

1024
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:13,461
Your metaphors are so beautiful.

1025
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:14,829
But it was time for me to leave,

1026
00:39:14,863 --> 00:39:16,964
and I didn't feel like
explaining why

1027
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:18,499
to you or anyone.

1028
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:20,301
Everything that happened
after...

1029
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:21,535
the fight we had,

1030
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,671
not giving you a heads-up
when my company took on

1031
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:25,106
the Morningstar development

1032
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,343
and bulldozed
the nurse's old house...

1033
00:39:29,378 --> 00:39:32,480
I do regret that.

1034
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:35,349
I had a good run here.

1035
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:40,321
But after you and Tom and Donna
and April and Terry left,

1036
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:42,556
when I looked around
this office,

1037
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:44,792
nothing was the same.

1038
00:39:44,826 --> 00:39:47,261
Yeah, well,
there's a way to fix that.

Well, this is different

♪ Fire ♪

1054
00:40:49,524 --> 00:40:51,959
Oh. Morning, guys.

1055
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,394
Good morning, Leslie.

1056
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:54,762
What did you do to the office?

1057
00:40:54,796 --> 00:40:56,530
Ron, you're wearing
my yoga clothes.

1058
00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:57,865
You're gonna stretch out
the elastic.

1059
00:40:57,899 --> 00:41:00,001
We're sorry.

1060
00:41:03,138 --> 00:41:05,273
♪ Fire and money and people ♪

1061
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,624
Hey.

1062
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:10,825
I moved our meetings to tomorrow

1063
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:15,282
because you are drunk
and hungover simultaneously

1064
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:16,650
at 2:00 in the afternoon.

1065
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:18,485
Yeah. Good call.

1066
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,553
Also, you have a visitor.

1067
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:22,088
No, whoever it is,
I have zero interest in...

1068
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:23,089
- Hello.

1069
00:41:23,124 --> 00:41:24,491
Ron!

1070
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:26,359
Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron.

1071
00:41:26,394 --> 00:41:29,062
We just spent 12 hours
together, woman.

1072
00:41:29,096 --> 00:41:30,196
Mm, don't care.

1073
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:31,731
I have three years' worth
of hugs

1074
00:41:31,766 --> 00:41:33,667
to force upon you
against your will.

1075
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:36,269
I have a small object for you.

1076
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:39,239
Call it an official
peace offering, I suppose.

1077
00:41:39,273 --> 00:41:41,575
Wow.
This is very sweet.

1078
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:44,444
But you do realize I gave you
this picture six hours ago.

1079
00:41:44,478 --> 00:41:46,346
The frame is the gift.

1080
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,115
When my company took on
the Morningstar development,

1081
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:53,019
and I realized it meant
bulldozing Ann's old house,

1082
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:54,788
I salvaged her front door.

1083
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:55,855
Then I stripped off

1084
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,525
all the terrible paint
and lacquer...

1085
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,227
people really don't know
how to finish wood properly...

1086
00:42:01,262 --> 00:42:03,797
and I made it into
this frame for you

1087
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:08,335
in the event that
you and I ever...

1088
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:09,369
Ron.

1089
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,404
You big, fat, giant sap.

1090
00:42:11,439 --> 00:42:13,373
That seems unnecessary.

1091
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:14,607
I love it.

1092
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:15,642
But I feel bad.

1093
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:17,477
I don't have anything for you.

1094
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:19,613
I... For the first time
in my life,

1095
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:20,914
I am present-less.

1096
00:42:20,948 --> 00:42:22,549
How 'bout you buy me a meal?

1097
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,550
You hungry?

1098
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:24,985
I'm starving.

1099
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:27,087
April, Ron and I
are going to JJ's

1100
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:28,455
to eat too much breakfast food.

1101
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:30,523
Why does anybody in the world

1102
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:33,393
ever eat anything
but breakfast food?

1103
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:35,161
People are idiots, Ron.

1104
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:38,261
