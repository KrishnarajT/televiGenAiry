1
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:22,816
Okay, the central question that the senators
are gonna be asking is,

2
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:25,308
"Why should we invest in
the National Parks Service?"

3
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,210
- April...
- Well, it is simple, Leslie.

4
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:28,745
In today's fast-paced society,

5
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,546
national parks are still
the best place

6
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:32,982
for full moon
werewolf transformations.

7
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:33,983
I know you're kidding.

8
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:35,418
But I also know that
you're prepared

9
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:37,086
and we are going to do great.

10
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,521
How psyched are you
about this trip?

11
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:41,257
April, are you super psyched?

12
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:43,793
Yeah. Also you have
lipstick on your teeth.

13
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:45,461
I do? Mm, okay.
Good looking out.

14
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,696
We're a great team.

15
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,364
Well, I never thought
I'd say this,

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,134
but I think I know
what's going on in your head.

17
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:54,137
Oh, well then,
welcome to the terror dome.

18
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:57,073
Okay, you need to tell Leslie
that you want to leave your job.

19
00:00:57,107 --> 00:01:00,076
No. She freaks out
when anything changes.

20
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,111
One time Andy told her that
I was getting rid of my bangs

21
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,513
and she called 9-1-1.

22
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:05,315
Okay, well, I can't
keep your secret much longer.

23
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:07,350
Anytime your name comes up,
I panic

24
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:09,619
and change the subject to
the Twin Peaks reboot

25
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:10,887
'til she gets bored.

26
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:12,221
So you talk for one second?

27
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:14,057
You're gonna spend
the next couple days with her.

28
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:16,159
If you talk to her
directly and honestly,

29
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,428
she can be
surprisingly open-minded.

30
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,629
Oh, really? Oh, okay.

31
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,764
Hey, Leslie, um, I was
thinking about changing

32
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,233
the font on the itineraries.

33
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:24,267
What do you think?

34
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,635
What? Why?

35
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,804
On what grounds?
Those... those fonts are perfect.

36
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,273
It's readable and compact,
it's all on one page.

37
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,108
That's insane.
Don't mess with that.

38
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,143
I mean, I appreciate
your initiative,

39
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:37,914
but itineraries are not
the right place to mess around.

40
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:41,918
Yeah. April, I told you,
that was an absurd idea.

42
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,073
I don't care what Ben says.

43
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:05,875
I'm not going to tell Leslie
I'm leaving my job

44
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,511
on this trip. She'll drown me
in the Potomac...

45
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,547
while she recites facts
about the Potomac.

46
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:13,016
Well don't fret, cookie.
We've made progress, haven't we?

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,218
We got a whole list of all
the things you need

48
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:16,553
out of a new job.

49
00:02:16,587 --> 00:02:19,422
Apple juice, barbeque sauce,

50
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,890
Count Chocula...
wait.

51
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,805
Oh, sorry, that's the list
of cool new nicknames

52
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:23,860
I want people to call me.

53
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,662
Here's your list.

54
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:26,796
How can I tell her I'm leaving

55
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:28,698
when I don't even know
what job I want?

56
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,467
Babe, I wish you
were coming with me.

57
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:33,002
I just decided what
I am going to do

58
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:34,118
while April is out of town.

59
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:36,974
I'm going to round up the team
and find her a new job.

60
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:38,676
Yeah, Ben Wyatt please?

61
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,813
Tell him it's Count Chocula.

62
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:45,549
Uh, no it's Andrew Dwyer.
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,117
So April wants to leave?

64
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:50,688
I always knew she
would tire of government.

65
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:51,855
Took long enough.

66
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,923
Well, both me and Ben

67
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,391
are trying to help April
find a new job,

68
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:55,960
and we thought maybe
she could work for you.

69
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:58,996
I feel like it would be
a perfect fit.

70
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,665
Although, I don't know exactly
what you guys do here.

71
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,535
I'm guessing...

72
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:05,736
it's a business?

73
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,205
Assassins? Hit men?

74
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,274
Doctors. You guys
are doctors.

75
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:12,109
We build things.

76
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:14,078
Come on, let me show you around.

77
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:18,649
This is a door.
These, of course, are walls.

78
00:03:18,683 --> 00:03:20,684
What else?
What else? Ah!

79
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,786
Meet our Vice President,
Don Swanson.

80
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,221
Don, this is Andrew
and Benjamin.

81
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:25,522
Pleasure to meet you.

82
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:28,325
Is this your brother?

83
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,761
You have a brother.

84
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,863
No.

85
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:36,267
Fine. Yes. I suppose
the cat's out of the bag.

86
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:39,203
I have a brother.
One brother.

87
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:40,971
All those years together
at the Parks department

88
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:42,606
and you never told us
you had a brother.

89
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,774
You worked at
the Parks department?

90
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,476
Tour's over!

91
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,480
Okay. Carry-on bag's packed.
Trashy magazines purchased.

92
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:52,783
Boarding passes in hand,
and we have 26 minutes

93
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,585
for unstructured chat time.

94
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,653
What do you want to talk about?

95
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:58,155
I don't know.
Nothing.

96
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,190
I thought maybe we could
talk about your future.

97
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:02,960
Wanna talk about your future?

98
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,529
Yeah. I've actually been
thinking about that

99
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:07,131
- a lot lately.
- Yeah, I figured.

100
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,633
It's hard, at your age,
to figure out your path.

101
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:10,868
- I know.
- Yeah.

102
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,569
I was gonna surprise you
with this in Washington,

103
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:13,637
but, you know, what the heck?

104
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:15,205
It's unstructured chat time.

105
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,008
So...
ta-da!

106
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,778
This is your clear,
definitive path

107
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:21,946
through the federal government.

108
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,715
It starts here today
with this flight

109
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:26,684
and it goes all the way to 2022.

110
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:27,951
Cool, right?

111
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,954
Wow. This is intense.

112
00:04:29,988 --> 00:04:31,689
I had to make some guesses about

113
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:33,390
your ultimate government
objectives

114
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,359
and your fashion choices,
etcetera,

115
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:37,161
but the point is with this

116
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,662
you don't have to worry.

117
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,398
I know!
I feel so relaxed.

118
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,666
Yeah! I know!

119
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,235
What's up with these shirts?

120
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,570
Gov Buds for Life?

121
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:48,639
Just a little fun I was having,
you know?

122
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:51,475
I didn't really make the shirts.

123
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:52,676
But did you though?

124
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,245
Yes, I did!

125
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,548
Ha-ha! Ta-da!

126
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,218
Oh, and also,
I have a middle seat.

127
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:05,289
April!
Group one is boarding!

128
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,795
Break it down. What will she be
doing at this job?

129
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:12,293
Well, she'd have about six
people reporting to her.

130
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,447
And if she started soon,
she could project manage

131
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,149
our new warehouse in Snerling.

132
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,284
Get to be my own boss.
So far, so good.

133
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,288
She also wants passionate
interest in subject matter.

134
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,924
So, what kind of building is it?

135
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,626
It's a large scale storage unit

136
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,328
for surplus vinyl sheeting.

137
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:31,698
Okay. So that's, uh,
boring.

138
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,666
Would she have
an opportunity to practice

139
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,602
any creative problem solving?

140
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:39,539
Creativity is for people
with glasses who like to lie.

141
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,509
Although, I suppose she could
use creative ways

142
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:45,078
to organize and stack
the vinyl sheeting.

143
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,546
No, that's insane.

144
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,182
We use the Towsend method.
It's tried and true.

145
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,884
I think this might
be a dead end.

146
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,485
I think you might be right.

147
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,254
But getting a good person
out of government

148
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,955
is a worthwhile endeavor.

149
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,425
I will help, but first
I'm gonna need some grub.

150
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,760
Ooh, yeah! Let's grab some
lunch and some ice cream!

151
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,495
Then maybe some
after ice cream tacos?

152
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,450
We'll just brainstorm and
maybe grab some snacks.

153
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,799
Vaughn, Lon.

154
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,000
Ron.

155
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,138
Okay, I think we're all set.

156
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,473
Even though I'm taking the lead
on these meetings,

157
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,941
- don't be afraid to jump in.
- Copy that.

158
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,377
April, when Randy brings up
the river project,

159
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,646
- that is your cue to...
- Distract the guards

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,749
so the Hamburglar can
make his escape.

161
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,951
We're meeting with
a lot of senators today.

162
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,186
- Is she going to be okay?
- Yeah.

163
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,788
It's just April.
Trust me.

164
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:31,491
And we hope you agree that
this is the best plan

165
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,692
to preserve
national parks' funding

166
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,360
into the next decade.

167
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,756
Well, so Leslie,
what do you think?

168
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:37,330
Is... is this the right move?

169
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,365
Well, I think it's the only
move, Senator Boxer.

170
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,402
I don't think this chance
is gonna come around again.

171
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,938
Well, you know,
if it's good with Leslie,

172
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,539
it's good with me.

173
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,341
Well, I have another great idea.

174
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,543
How about you and me,
April, Randy,

175
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,545
historical lamp posts of D.C.?

176
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,881
Walking tour
starts in 15 minutes.

177
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,249
Sounds great, but, uh,

178
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,352
I do have an appointment
with the President.

179
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:00,620
Can we come?

180
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,889
What kind of a business is this?

181
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,892
Is it like hit men
or astronauts?

182
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,994
It's an accounting firm.

183
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,163
But they recently opened up
a consulting wing.

184
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,798
And consulting is perfect
for April.

185
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,766
You think this Barney fellow
will listen

186
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,101
to what we have to say?

187
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:16,970
Ben! Ben is here!

188
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,471
Hi, Ben!

189
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,340
Ted! Ben is here!

190
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:24,210
Hey, it is actuarially very good
to see you guys.

191
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:26,513
Aah! Ha ha!

192
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,747
Ben!

193
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,884
- They like me here.
- You gotta hear this!

194
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:32,963
So we think we can
keep costs down

195
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:34,103
and still meet deadlines.

196
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,857
You know, I have to say
I'm really impressed

197
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:37,926
with what you guys are doing
over at Interior.

198
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,027
Thank you, Senator Gillibrand,

199
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:40,261
we really appreciate
your support.

200
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:41,996
Would you mind signing
a copy of your book?

201
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:43,364
Oh, of course, of course.

202
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,465
I took the liberty of
writing the inscription.

203
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,667
All you have to do is sign.

204
00:07:45,701 --> 00:07:48,469
"To Leslie, my inspiration,
my muse,

205
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:50,772
my partner in crime.
I owe it all to you."

206
00:07:50,806 --> 00:07:53,074
And there's room for a P.S.
if you feel

207
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:54,709
there's more you left out.

208
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:57,178
Well, I think I've said all
I wanna say right here.

209
00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:58,913
- Okay.
- Okay.

210
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:01,015
Yeah, well, I can't do
that right now.

211
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,551
Oh, boy.
I'll call you back.

212
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,653
Hello, Senator.
Do you have a minute to chat?

213
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:07,188
Oh, I can't right now.
I've got a meeting.

214
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:09,023
Well, actually, I checked
with your staff

215
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:11,459
and they said that
you have a free half hour.

216
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,027
Did anyone ever tell you

217
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:15,396
that your tenacity
can be intimidating?

218
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:17,599
Yes. Every month of my life
since fourth grade.

219
00:08:17,633 --> 00:08:19,601
Now, let's talk about
national parks.

220
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,970
Well, I just have to say
I'm very surprised

221
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:24,672
that the two of you are
seeing eye to eye on this one.

222
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:26,407
Well, Senator Buckner and I are
both concerned

223
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,443
about our nation's resources.

224
00:08:28,477 --> 00:08:30,845
And that absolutely includes
our national parks.

225
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,914
But that's not all we
have in common.

226
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:36,351
In fact, our real passion is...

227
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:39,254
Polynesian folk music.

228
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:40,755
W... what?

229
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,090
Polynesian folk music.

230
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:43,958
Our band is playing in
Georgetown tonight

231
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:44,969
if you'd like to come.

232
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:47,285
We're called
"Across the Isle."

233
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,254
Did you get that?
Aisle? Isle?

234
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,589
Like an island and then
across the aisle,

235
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:52,791
the political aisle.

236
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:54,759
It's like a pun.
It's a play on words.

237
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:55,960
- I do get it.
- Are you sure?

238
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:57,275
We are definitely
coming to this.

239
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,631
It's $8.00
if you buy your tickets now.

240
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,965
It's $10.00 at the door.

241
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,735
Fiscal conservative.
Love this guy.

242
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:04,736
- Love this guy.
- Yeah.

243
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,938
April Ludgate Dwyer.

244
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,339
She worked on the Gryzzl deal

245
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:10,041
that you guys did
the finances for.

246
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:12,877
Now, I know that you're
opening up a consulting wing,

247
00:09:12,912 --> 00:09:15,513
and we just think that April
would be a great hire.

248
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,716
Yeah, and here's the thing,
Barney.

249
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,951
We're obviously very familiar
with what consulting is

250
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:21,186
but why don't you go ahead
and tell my friends here,

251
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,488
because I don't think
that they know.

252
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,691
Well, it's really about finding
creative solutions

253
00:09:26,726 --> 00:09:28,860
to difficult problems.

254
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:32,297
Now, a lot of times
there's firings, so...

255
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:35,000
consultants aren't
exactly well liked.

256
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,268
Holy crap. This is the job
for her, I can feel it.

257
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:38,937
She'll take it!
Now let's talk perks.

258
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:40,405
Does she get the summers off?
Is it like school?

259
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:41,480
- Son, easy.
- Well,

260
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,252
what did she major in?

261
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:45,354
Economics? Accounting?

262
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,056
She designed her own major.

263
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:49,759
- "Halloween Studies."
- Trust me, Barney.

264
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:52,462
She's brilliant and
a very fast learner.

265
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:55,531
Does that, uh,
compound your interests?

266
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:57,166
Huh?

267
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,701
Ha ha!

268
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:01,137
So what do you say?
Huh, Barney?

269
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,840
- Oh, Ben, that was amazing.
- Thank you.

270
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:06,008
But it's too late
for her to apply.

271
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:08,978
I'm sorry but we're not really
taking any more applicants.

272
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:13,416
Though I could make an exception
for someone else.

273
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,385
Not interested.

274
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:17,587
Okay, so five
yeses and four nos.

275
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:19,222
Not a bad start.

276
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:20,490
So, Leslie, I was going to talk
to you about this

277
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:23,159
in a few weeks,
but Mike Norbert is retiring.

278
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:26,396
Oh, really?
'Ol Norbs is stepping down.

279
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,464
Couldn't handle the pressure,
huh? What a wuss.

280
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:29,799
His marriage is falling apart.

281
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,367
Oh... oh, okay.

282
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:32,635
She had an affair
with his best friend.

283
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:34,170
Ooh, okay, I feel bad about
what I said before.

284
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:35,204
Yeah, I get it, I get it.

285
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,906
So, anyway,
the good news for you is

286
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,141
we'd like to promote you
to Deputy Director

287
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:41,310
of Operations and Interior.

288
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:42,678
Wow.

289
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:44,480
You'd have to move to D.C.
and you have to complete

290
00:10:44,515 --> 00:10:46,883
the Senior Executive Service
Candidate Development program.

291
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,251
I have to enroll
in S.E.S.C.D.P.?

292
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,853
44 weeks of intensive courses
and note taking?

293
00:10:50,888 --> 00:10:53,423
Um, it's a dream come true.

294
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:55,425
And I have to warn you, there'll
be a confirmation hearing.

295
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,660
A confirmation hearing?
A freaking confirmation hearing?

296
00:10:57,694 --> 00:10:59,228
Excuse me a second.

297
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:00,596
What's that?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

298
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:02,698
Um, to the best of my
recollection,

299
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,667
yes, I accept the job.

300
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:06,035
Oh, excuse me, ma'am?

301
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,503
Do you mind if
I borrow your hat?

302
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,172
I just want to throw it up in
the air victoriously.

303
00:11:09,206 --> 00:11:10,840
- No.
- Ma'am!

304
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,577
I think that job's
perfect for April.

305
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:16,612
We just have to convince Barney
to give her a shot.

306
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:18,681
I mean, first problem,
she's not as qualified

307
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:19,982
as the other applicants.

308
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:22,085
Simple solution.
I break into her college

309
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,654
and I change her degree
to accounting. Easy.

310
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:27,490
On my way out, look up at
the blackboard, what is that?

311
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:29,292
Impossible math equation?

312
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:30,426
I solve it.

313
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:32,728
X equals Y, obviously.

314
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:34,330
Professor comes up to me
and says,

315
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:38,000
"I've been working on that
for 50 years.

316
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:42,071
Why don't you accept
this math trophy?"

317
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:44,273
By the time he turns around,
I'm gone.

318
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:46,542
We need to highlight
April's strengths.

319
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,111
I thought we could update
her resume.

320
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:50,480
This is the one
she applied to Parks with.

321
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:53,750
It's just a signed photograph
of a puppet named Alf.

322
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:56,018
Okay, so, we make
her an actual resume

323
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:57,487
then put on a big presentation.

324
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:00,089
Show Barney that
she's more than qualified.

325
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:01,390
Gonna need all hands on deck.

326
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:03,626
That's Craig, Donna,
and most importantly...

327
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:05,394
- Please no.
- Come on, don't do it.

328
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,296
Oh, you wanna photocopy?

329
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:09,732
You guys want to do
all the mindless work?

330
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,068
Yeah, I didn't think so.

331
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:16,072
Get me Garry Gergich.

332
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:19,008
Look around, April.

333
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,777
What do you see?

334
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:22,612
Fountains.

335
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:24,314
Water.

336
00:12:24,348 --> 00:12:25,982
Sky.

337
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,551
You... looking at me
like a crazy person.

338
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:31,821
I see a new home.
I am gonna take that job.

339
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:35,058
Ben's gonna run for Congress,
he will win eventually,

340
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:36,392
and then we're gonna
split our time

341
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:37,794
between Washington and Pawnee.

342
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:39,996
That's great. It looks like
everything is

343
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,997
falling into place for you.

344
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:42,365
For us, April!

345
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,733
- For us!
- Oh, God.

346
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,834
Whoa! What is that?

347
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:46,636
Over there, a lamp post?

348
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,910
Is that historic, do you think?

349
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,439
No. They put that in
in the 70s.

350
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,407
Look, I am so ahead
of my five-year plan.

351
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:54,477
Which means that you're gonna
need a new five-year plan,

352
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:55,812
And here it is.

353
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:58,414
Ow, it's hot! How did you
make this so fast?

354
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:01,084
I keep a local binder maker
on retainer in D.C.

355
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:04,187
We are about to embark on
such an amazing journey.

356
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:07,590
This is gonna be our city.
And this is gonna be our bench.

357
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:10,793
April, we have a bench
in D.C.!

358
00:13:10,828 --> 00:13:13,463
I'm sorry, Leslie,
I can't do this anymore.

359
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:15,298
I don't want to work
in government.

360
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:16,499
I quit.

361
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:21,070
What are you talking about?

362
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:22,672
You quit? Why?

363
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:26,175
Because, honestly,
I don't even know if I like

364
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,877
working in national parks.

365
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:29,078
Or government.

366
00:13:29,113 --> 00:13:31,581
I just fell backwards
into your world

367
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:34,717
and years have gone by,
and now I'm here

368
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:36,152
and... Andy and Ben have been
helping me

369
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:37,587
look into different jobs
to figure out

370
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:39,122
what I really want to do.

371
00:13:39,156 --> 00:13:40,723
Ben who? Ben Wyatt?

372
00:13:40,758 --> 00:13:42,792
He's been helping you
behind my back?

373
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:44,861
Wow, okay, you know what,
we had a good run,

374
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:46,195
- but he's dead to me now.
- It's just...

375
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,264
I've been on this weird path
my entire adult life,

376
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:50,400
and I need to figure out
what I really want.

377
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:51,934
I cannot believe
you're quitting.

378
00:13:51,969 --> 00:13:54,037
And I cannot believe this is the
first time I'm hearing it.

379
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:56,406
And on our bench...

380
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,425
of all places.

381
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,020
You know, it's just
so frustrating.

382
00:14:08,103 --> 00:14:09,370
I mean, I love her, but,
you know,

383
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:10,405
you spend so much time and
effort on someone's life

384
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:11,679
and she's just gonna quit on me?

385
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,708
It's like, what's the point,
you know?

386
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,141
Wow, Leslie. I haven't
seen you this upset

387
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,443
since you almost forgot
Ann's half-birthday.

388
00:14:18,478 --> 00:14:20,078
- Yeah.
- Tell me.

389
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:21,079
How many times have
we had lunch?

390
00:14:21,114 --> 00:14:23,749
Five.
Well, eight, if you count

391
00:14:23,783 --> 00:14:25,584
all those times I showed up
unannounced at your office

392
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:26,718
with mini-muffins.

393
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,654
And why have we had lunch
so many times?

394
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:31,690
Well, because, when I knew I
would be coming to Washington

395
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:35,027
to work, I wore you down until
you agreed to become my friend.

396
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,662
I'm so glad that you did.

397
00:14:36,696 --> 00:14:39,298
And you are wonderful friend,
but, sometimes

398
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,366
you're so focused and driven

399
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:42,801
that you forget about
people's feelings.

400
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:46,638
Ah, pfft! Name one time
I've done that.

401
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:48,240
Well, you were so wrapped up
in your story

402
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:51,043
that you actually ate my waffle.

403
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:53,111
Sometimes, all you can do

404
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:55,147
is give people
a little bit of advice

405
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:57,583
and a push,
but you have to realize

406
00:14:57,617 --> 00:15:00,085
April has to be able to
make up her own mind.

407
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:02,321
Ah, you're right...

408
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:04,189
once again, Madeleine Albright.

409
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:05,991
Can I have my pin back now?

410
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,559
Oh! Oh, yeah, sorry.

411
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:08,994
Thank you for letting
me wear it.

412
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,329
Just makes me feel
very powerful.

413
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:11,663
Me too.

414
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:16,668
Resume's done. I used bullet
points instead of numbers

415
00:15:16,703 --> 00:15:18,604
because I find it conveys
strength and confidence.

416
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:21,173
A binder of her accomplishments.

417
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,175
Photos of her
getting the job done.

418
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,143
And $500 cash,
in case you want to go

419
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:26,378
the straight-up bribe route.

420
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:27,646
Donna...

421
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,348
You put me on the team,
I find a way to win.

422
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:30,515
Okay, copies are made.

423
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,085
Um, everything has been
collated and stapled.

424
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,720
And all the research
has been double-checked.

425
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:36,388
I went through
quite a few staples.

426
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:39,124
I added a personal testimony
vouching for April's brilliance.

427
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:40,392
And this guy better
appreciate it because

428
00:15:40,426 --> 00:15:42,995
I do not compare people to
Mary J. Blige lightly.

429
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:44,563
Uh, no one should.

430
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:45,597
Do you want to go
to dinner tonight?

431
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:46,798
- I do not.
- Respect.

432
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,600
- I'm free.
- I have plans.

433
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:50,068
Well, great job, guys.

434
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:52,304
With all this, Barney will at
least have to give her a shot.

435
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:54,873
Sure, they did a good job,
but this isn't enough.

436
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:57,342
And I've been thinking
about it all day

437
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,910
and I have a plan

438
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,412
to go the extra mile

439
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:03,115
and make April seem like
the ideal candidate.

440
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:11,123
Give me the job!

441
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:14,559
My name's April Ludgate and my
talent is explosive!

442
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:18,997
Go U-S-A!
U-S-A!

443
00:16:19,032 --> 00:16:21,566
U-S-A!
U-S-A!

444
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:24,236
U-S-A! When should I tell April
to show up?

445
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,504
My car...

446
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:32,511
Hey.

447
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,112
Thank you for coming.

448
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:35,814
Yeah, well, I had to miss

449
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:38,250
the memorable rain gutters of
Washington walking tour,

450
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:39,585
so, this better be good.

451
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:42,688
I'm sorry I blew up
at you yesterday.

452
00:16:42,722 --> 00:16:45,324
I really want all of my friends
to be happy together,

453
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:49,461
but, more importantly,
I just want them to be happy.

454
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:53,065
If you feel like you need to
move on, I totally get it.

455
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,934
Okay.

456
00:16:55,969 --> 00:16:57,569
- Turn around.
- What? Why?

457
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,438
Because I'm about to say
something serious

458
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:01,173
and I can't do it if I have to
look you in the eye.

459
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,708
- Please.
- Okay.

460
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,612
Now take your shoes off
and wear them like mittens.

461
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:09,915
- April...
- Okay, sorry.

462
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:16,755
When I started working for you,
I was aimless

463
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:20,325
and just thought everything
was stupid and lame,

464
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,095
and you turned me into someone

465
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:26,365
with goals and ambition,

466
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:29,334
which is really the only reason
why I'm even thinking about

467
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,436
what I really want.

468
00:17:33,906 --> 00:17:38,277
I just...
wanna say thank you.

469
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,280
And I love you very much.

470
00:17:41,314 --> 00:17:45,417
Which is why I have decided not
to turn you into a sea urchin,

471
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:48,487
which I could do,
because I am an actual witch

472
00:17:48,521 --> 00:17:51,456
- with powers and I'm evil
- I know.

473
00:17:51,491 --> 00:17:53,458
- and I hate everything.
- I know you do.

474
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:56,461
I know.
Thank you, April.

475
00:17:56,496 --> 00:18:00,766
So you don't have any idea
what you want to do?

476
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,569
Well, here's the good news:
I am on the case.

477
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:06,772
I know some people who might be
able to help us. Come on.

478
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:09,541
April, this is Alyssa from the
American Service Foundation.

479
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:11,076
They take young people like you

480
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,878
who are trying to
explore a new path

481
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:14,946
and match them with one of
the thousands of jobs

482
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:16,949
across America
that help communities.

483
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,817
Alyssa, this is April Ludgate,

484
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:21,553
the single greatest
human being ever,

485
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:23,989
and you need to find her a job
that she will love and cherish

486
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:25,057
and make her life feel complete.

487
00:18:25,091 --> 00:18:26,158
Okay. I'm sorry.

488
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,526
I found this crazy woman
on the street

489
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,061
and she won't leave me alone.

490
00:18:29,095 --> 00:18:32,130
Oh, I'm very familiar
with Leslie's... enthusiasm.

491
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:33,732
They contacted us
last year because

492
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:35,767
they wanted to place some people
in national parks.

493
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:37,970
Two days later, we had
set up the entire program,

494
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:40,606
and she sent me a throw pillow
with my face stitched onto it.

495
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,774
Not my best work.
Plus, you changed your hair.

496
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:44,009
I'm gonna send you another one.

497
00:18:44,043 --> 00:18:46,745
Okay, go solve all of
your career problems.

498
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,946
I'll wait right here.

499
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:49,114
Sorry.

500
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:51,791
- That-a girl!
- Ugh, Mom!

501
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:55,210
I don't know, Madeleine.

502
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,431
They're taking forever and
I'm starting to lose it.

503
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:58,518
Talk to me, okay?

504
00:18:58,552 --> 00:18:59,652
Your voice makes me calm.

505
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:01,388
Tell me another Yeltsin story.

506
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:02,884
Okay, she's here.
I have to go. Bye.

507
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,095
Say hi to your daughters.
Hey. Hi.

508
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:06,482
How did it go?

509
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:10,185
I'm great. I know exactly
what I want to do.

510
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,921
Yes!
Is it Teach for America?

511
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:14,456
No! Habitat for Humanity?

512
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,425
No! It's working
with animals.

513
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:20,129
No. I want to work here.
At the foundation.

514
00:19:20,163 --> 00:19:21,964
I want to be like Alyssa.

515
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:23,265
I wanna tell people what to do

516
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,501
and then send them
far away from me.

517
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:26,535
It's perfect.

518
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,003
And it hits everything
on my list.

519
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:30,205
Creative problem solving,
working one-on-one...

520
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,342
I am 100,000%
in support of this idea.

521
00:19:33,376 --> 00:19:35,110
This is an amazing idea.
I love this idea!

522
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:36,345
And I love you!

523
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:37,513
So are they hiring?

524
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:39,148
What did Alyssa say
when you told her?

525
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:40,582
Um, nothing.
I didn't tell her yet.

526
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:44,019
I wanted to see if you thought
it was a good idea first.

527
00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:45,054
What?

528
00:19:45,088 --> 00:19:46,722
Bad idea?

529
00:19:46,756 --> 00:19:48,324
You wanted to run
something by me?

530
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,325
Oh, my God.

531
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,661
Yes. So, will you help me?

532
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:55,130
April, you don't need me.

533
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:56,565
You can get any job you want.

534
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,200
All by yourself.

535
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:00,603
Well, obviously I'm going to
vet your resume

536
00:20:00,637 --> 00:20:02,004
and we'll hold
some mock interviews

537
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,772
and I'll choose your outfit
and everything but...

538
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:07,343
you can get this sucker
on your own.

539
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:10,646
So, long story short, we might
have found you the perfect job

540
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,581
but also I might have blown it.

541
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:15,150
Ben and Ron are there now
to try to fix it.

542
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:17,853
And if they don't, I feel like
it's kind of on them.

543
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,588
Everyone is being
so nice to me lately.

544
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:22,291
It's weird. I feel like I need
to take a shower in pig's blood

545
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:23,692
to wash all the niceness off me.

546
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:24,860
It's because we love you.

547
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:26,061
We want you to be happy.

548
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,963
This consulting job could be
the answer.

549
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:30,499
Yeah, so about that...

550
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:35,253
Please don't hold anything Andy
did against April.

551
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:37,622
She is an exceptional human being,

552
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:39,777
who married a well meaning goof.

553
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:43,110
And I think that presentation
we put together says it all.

554
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,058
All we're asking is thatyou meet with her

555
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:47,765
and seriously consider her
for the job.

556
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:50,696
And if she disappoints you,
you can hold me...

557
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:52,987
accountable.

558
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:55,494
- Right?
- You know what?

559
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:57,714
If her friends are trying
this hard,

560
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,723
there must be something
amazing about her.

561
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,148
Tell her I'll meet with her tomorrow...

562
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:02,533
Uh, hold on. April?

563
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,745
Hey, we were just talking about you.

564
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:06,195
We got some good news.

565
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:10,079
Oh, boy.

566
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,766
Okay.

567
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:17,274
She doesn't want the job.

568
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:19,375
I see.

569
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:25,629
Well, this is uncomfortable.
