1
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:18,370
It's The Johnny Karate Super
Awesome Musical Explosion Show.

2
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:22,119
Now, to introduce your host,
Johnny Karate,

3
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:25,790
here is me, Perd Hapley!

4
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,693
Silence!

5
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:31,462
Welcome to the only show
that's all about learning,

6
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:34,065
music, animals, fireworks,
water skis,

7
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:37,268
and above all, ice cream, pizza,

8
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:39,036
ninjas, getting stronger,

9
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,405
sharks versus bears,
and above all...

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,608
- karate!
- Hiya!

11
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:46,544
Now, why don't you kids
help me sing The Welcome Song!

12
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:48,212
Let me just grab my guitar.

13
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,849
Someone has stolen my guitar.

14
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:57,221
This seems like a case
for Special Agent...

15
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,189
Burt Macklin.

16
00:00:58,223 --> 00:01:03,928
Sync & corrections by honeybunny

17
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,364
I don't give a crap, Batman.
You work for me.

18
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:10,068
Increase the perimeter!

19
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:12,270
Macklin, the President's
called six times.

20
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:13,704
If we don't get
that guitar back,

21
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:15,339
the peace in Iraq
will be canceled.

22
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:16,974
Get off my back, Chief!

23
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,376
I'm doing the best I can.

24
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,611
I don't play by the rules.

25
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:22,213
But I get results.

26
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:23,815
Dang it!
You're right again, Macklin.

27
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:25,082
And I'm sorry.

28
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:26,517
You're the best agent I've seen.

29
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:28,920
And I've worked with James Bond.

30
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:30,021
- This clue may help.
- Mm.

31
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:32,156
It was left at the crime scene.

32
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,091
You're dismissed.

33
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:38,396
This case just keeps getting
deeper and deeper.

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,531
I'm drowning
in the adult end of the pool,

35
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:43,201
and the lifeguard's off
in the bathroom pooping.

36
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,905
That's good writing.

37
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,941
Johnny Karate's guitar
has been stolen.

38
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:52,844
That instrument is worth
literally $900 million.

39
00:01:52,878 --> 00:01:55,413
But more importantly, he can't
play The Good-bye Song

40
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:56,380
without it.

41
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:57,949
So, by the time this show
is over,

42
00:01:57,983 --> 00:02:00,151
I will find who stole it,
and they will pay

43
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:01,652
the ultimate price.

44
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:05,490
A one-way ticket
to the Funky Monkey Dunk Tank!

45
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:06,958
All that and more,

46
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:12,029

So, karate masters, you are here

54
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:35,086
for an extra-awesome
and super-special episode

55
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,387
of Johnny Karate.

56
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,625
And that is because
it's my final show.

57
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:42,493
Aw.

58
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,928
Don't look glum.

59
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:46,864
In a couple of weeks, I'll be
moving to Washington, D.C.

60
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,301
It's the capital
of the entire world.

61
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:53,471
They have things there
like this white house

62
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:56,808
and this mental institution

63
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,444
and my very favorite,
the Lincoln Memorial.

64
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:02,613
It's this crazy statue
of this giant monster

65
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:03,781
sitting on a chair
that represents

66
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,216
all of America's enemies.

67
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,517
I'll be moving
to Washington, D.C.,

68
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:08,586
because my wife,
April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer,

69
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,121
has accepted
an amazing job there.

70
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:12,557
I'm very proud of her
and totally in love.

71
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:15,393
April, why don't you come on out
and talk to the children?

72
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:16,794
Take a bow for being so cool.

73
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,097
Hey, Johnny!

74
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:21,566
So, since it's your final show,
I wanted to do

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,969
one last extra-special
April's Animal Corner.

76
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:27,772
That's right.

77
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:30,575
This week
I brought one of the scariest,

78
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:33,244
weirdest animals
in the whole world...

79
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:36,047
a goliath
bird-eating tarantula.

80
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,849
Wow!

81
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,384
Ah!

82
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,853
Now, the name, "goliath"
means "giant."

83
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:45,123
And you can see that...

84
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:47,258
- Andy, where is it?
- What?

85
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,793
- Uh-oh.
- Where is it?

86
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:50,061
Don't look at me.
I don't know what happened.

87
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:51,863
I took it out to play
hide-and-seek.

88
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,097
I couldn't find it,
and then...

89
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,465
Oh, that's what happened.

90
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,301
Okay, well, once again,
April's Animal Corner

91
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:00,271
has turned into one
of our favorite segments...

92
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:02,106
Loose Animal in the Studio.

93
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,374
Yay!

94
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,376
And as always,
when we accidentally end up

95
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,944
doing
Loose Animal in the Studio,

96
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:09,547
we have to show you
this disclaimer.

97
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,249
Boring!

98
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:13,184
Here's a disclaimer,
I didn't read this disclaimer.

99
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,854
Ooh, good point.

100
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,689
Okay. Done.

101
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,792
Okay, kids,
so be on the lookout for a...

102
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:21,959
What's it called?

103
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:24,495
A goliath bird-eating
tarantula,

104
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,999
known locally to Venezuelans
as "the devil's fist."

105
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,802
Bye, kids!

106
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,004
Okay, kids, well,
we've got a lot of work to do,

107
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:35,873
performing the Five Karate
Moves to Success.

108
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,642

118
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,369
Hello, Carpenter Ron.

119
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:06,604
How are you doing?

120
00:05:06,638 --> 00:05:08,106
My contract is very specific.

121
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,475
I do not have to answer
that question.

122
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,010
This week I am making
a shadowbox frame,

123
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:16,647
which can be used to display
an object of great value.

124
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:19,517
This one is constructed
with American cherry wood.

125
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:22,286
Cherry, huh?
Now, I have just one question...

126
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:24,021
No, the wood does not taste
like cherry.

127
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,156
You cannot eat it.

128
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,125
I was not going to eat it,
Carpenter Ron.

129
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,193
I was going to lick it.

130
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,496
Always remember, kids,
when you find something new,

131
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,065
you must lick it
before you eat it.

132
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,660
That is incorrect
in a number of ways.

133
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:39,804
I sure have had some fun
making things with you, son.

134
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,439
Thank you
for everything you've done

135
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:42,840
for the children of this area.

136
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,142
You're welcome, Carpenter Ron.

137
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:47,245
Hey, kids, this, to me,
seems like a...

138
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,946
♪ Hug moment ♪

139
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,517
You are mistaken.
Remove the graphic.

140
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,586
Well, kids, it's time for our
next "Karate Move to Success."

141
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,121
Let's learn something.

142
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,895
Hello, Professor Smartbrain.

143
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,196
Hi, Johnny.

144
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,664
Listen, I don't know
if you got my email,

145
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,700
but I thought that
since this is our final show,

146
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,234
maybe we not use the...

147
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,470
Boring buzzer.

148
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,910
Okay, kids, today we're gonna
learn about geography.

149
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:22,046
Now, you, Johnny, are moving
to Washington, D.C.

150
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,482
I thought what we could talk
about is how fast

151
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:29,754
you could get there using
an airplane, a train, or a car.

152
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:33,458
Now, as you can see,
the airplane is the fastest.

153
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:35,827
Not the fastest.
What about teleporting?

154
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:38,563
Well, sure,
that would be really fun,

155
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,198
but it's impossible.

156
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:43,301
Nothing is impossible, kids.

157
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:45,770
Teleportation is impossible.

158
00:06:45,804 --> 00:06:46,938
It's about theoretical physics.

159
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,842
You know, you asked me
to do this. This was a favor...

160
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,481
Morning, Johnny.
Mail call.

161
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,751
Ya!

162
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,153
Hi, Mailman Barry.

163
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,354
Who brought me mail today?

164
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,324
Well, Johnny,
you got over 500 letters

165
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,659
from kids who love you, asking
for you and April to stay.

166
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,396
Aw, babe, did you hear that?

167
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,098
Now, Johnny, you also got
one very special letter.

168
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,466
It's from me.

169
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,535
And on the last day
of your show,

170
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:18,703
I thought I could read it
to you.

171
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,772
Aw.

172
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:24,675
"Dearest Andy, I have never
had a son of my own,

173
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,878
and I just want you to know
that for the past ten years"...

174
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,746
It's time to karate chop something!

175
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,486
Ninjas, attack!

176
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,522
Oh, jeez.

177
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,660
Disperse!

178
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,029
Remember, never attack
a real postal employee.

179
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,531
We're allowed
to attack Mailman Barry

180
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:49,033
because he volunteered to
help us with our karate moves.

181
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,802
I kind of thought
I'd be holding a piece of wood

182
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,804
or something, but, you know...

183
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,071
always happy to help.

184
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,746
Next up, we're going
to try something new,

185
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:57,054
with my good friend
Leslie Knope.

186
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:03,281
Hey, Johnny Karate,
I'm so happy to be here

187
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,216
on your last show ever.

188
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,517
Hi, Leslie.
I'm glad you're here

189
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,886
to teach us all how to be brave.

190
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,022
So, Leslie, what are you going
to be trying new this week?

191
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:14,592
I am going to be taking over
hosting my friend's TV show.

192
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:15,593
Huh?

193
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:17,095
Isn't that right, April?

194
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,896
That is right.

195
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,065
Johnny, you have made
so many kids

196
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,868
and so many parents so happy,
that we wanted to give you

197
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,236
a proper send-off.

198
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,972
Andy Dwyer/Johnny Karate,

199
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,909
this is your life.

200
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:36,214
Oh, my gosh, Leslie,
this is amazing.

201
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,483
I don't know what to say...

202
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:40,385
literally, because normally
I have a script

203
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:43,021
that I have to stick to, but...

204
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,190
I don't know what I'm supposed
to say right now.

205
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,425
It's kind of a nightmare.

206
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,560
Okay, you leave that
to us, Johnny.

207
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,629
Uh, when we come back,
we will take a look

208
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,598
at the journey of Andy Dwyer.

209
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,033
Stay tuned.

210
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,902
"Now listen to some words
from our sponsors,"

211
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:01,906
are the words I'm saying
right now.

212
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,409
Hire Very Good Building Company

213
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,843
for your construction needs.

214
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,844
Or do not.

215
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,013
I am not a beggar.

216
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:25,263
End of commercial.

217
00:09:28,446 --> 00:09:30,478
The Wamapoke people
have a saying...

218
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:33,081
"Only one who listens
hears the cry of the wolf."

219
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:38,052
That advice has been passed down
from generation to generation.

220
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:40,855
Today I give that advice to you.

221
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,992
Listen for Coinsy the Wolf
at Wamapoke Casino.

222
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:47,295
Twice a day, one lucky visitor
will hit the mega-wolf jackpot.

223
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:49,697
And Coinsy will howl for you!

224
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,878
The thing we return to now

225
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:06,981
is my Johnny Karate Show
return message.

226
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,951
Welcome back.
When I first met the man

227
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,387
standing next to me, he was not
a cultural phenomenon.

228
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:16,224
"Phenomenon" means
"to explore a cave."

229
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:17,792
He was going through
a tough time.

230
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:20,728
He had just broken both legs
from falling into a pit.

231
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,063
I was super wasted.

232
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,498
- It's a kids' show, Andy.
- Yes, good call.

233
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:24,899
- Kids' show.
- Good call.

234
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:28,770
That event set in motion many
wonderful things in my life,

235
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:30,405
including the building
of the Pawnee Commons.

236
00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:34,809
So, in a weird way, Andy,
I owe it all to you.

237
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:35,844
And now that the show is ending,

238
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:37,278
I'm gonna have to start
all over again.

239
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,447
Hopefully there's a pit
in Washington, D.C.,

240
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:40,682
that I could fall into.

241
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:43,418
Andy pulled his life together,
and he got himself a job

242
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:45,754
at the shoe-shine stand
in City Hall.

243
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:48,323
He then became
a bureaucratic assistant.

244
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,624
- Hi, honey.
- Hey. Hi.

245
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,559
He was always enthusiastic.

246
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:53,294
But he also kept track
of his appointments

247
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:55,330
by writing them on his arm.

248
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,765
Still do.

249
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,066
To commemorate that time
and to make sure

250
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,135
that you never miss
another appointment again,

251
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:03,938
we have brought you
a monogrammed day planner.

252
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:06,174
Guys...

253
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,776
So sweet.

254
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,777
Thank you.

255
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:10,512
Aw.

256
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,280
Oh, no.
I lost it.

257
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:13,615
The day planner's gone.
I can't find it anywhere.

258
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,751
What?

259
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:18,486
Fitting, really.

260
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:21,356
From then, Andy went
to England for a few months

261
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,991
to work for a nonprofit.

262
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:24,526
It was there that he befriended

263
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,328
the 14th Earl
of Cornwall-upon-Thames,

264
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:28,329
Sir Edgar Covington.

265
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:30,031
Ta-da!

266
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,200
Oh, my God, Eddie,
this is amazing!

267
00:11:34,703 --> 00:11:38,239
Andy, I am here in this weird,
flat place,

268
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:42,677
to name you a loyal and true
karate defender

269
00:11:42,712 --> 00:11:43,678
of the Queen's Realm.

270
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,384
Please get down on one knee.

271
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,821
This honor is bestowed on those
who have shown great achievement

272
00:11:52,855 --> 00:11:56,825
in fields of the arts, learning,
literature, and science.

273
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,928
Therefore, I hereby dub thee

274
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:03,431
a knight of the Order
of the British Empire.

275
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,900
Hang on,
can you actually do this?

276
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,902
Well, technically, only
the Queen can knight somebody,

277
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,839
but I'm so rich that she lets me
do what I want.

278
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:12,407
Would you like to be knighted?

279
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,842
Oh, no, no, no, no.

280
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:15,810
No, of course not.
It's Andy's day.

281
00:12:15,845 --> 00:12:16,845
Dude, I don't mind.

282
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,159
Oh, then, yes,
knight me, please.

283
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,248
Oh, my God, this is amazing!

284
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,118
Winter is coming
for Sir Ben Lightstorm.

285
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:24,419
Okay, you're both knights.

286
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,420
Cool.

287
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,856
Guys, this was so much fun.

288
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,292
Friend, coworker, musician,
husband, Andy Dwyer...

289
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:32,494
Sir Andy Dwyer.

290
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:34,396
Sir Andy Dwyer had become
so many things

291
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,497
to so many people.

292
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,532
But his greatest creation
was yet to come.

293
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:40,635
A salute to Johnny Karate
when we come back.

294
00:12:43,704 --> 00:12:44,905
We know what you want...

295
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:47,340
healthy, natural food
that still tastes great.

296
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,442
And we're here to tell you...

297
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,079
It doesn't exist.

298
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:53,713
Healthy food is for suckers.

299
00:12:53,748 --> 00:12:55,148
It tastes like garbage,

300
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:57,651
and if you say you like it,
you're a chump and a liar.

301
00:12:57,685 --> 00:12:59,986
Be honest.
This is what you want to eat...

302
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,257
It tastes amazing.

303
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,992
What's in it?
Who cares?

304
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:07,584
How many calories?
Shut up.

305
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,563
It's awesome.

306
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:17,626
One of Andy's
greatest achievements

307
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,702
was the success of his band,
Mouse Rat.

308
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,645
No one was doing
what we were doing.

309
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,780
Well, that's not really true.

310
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:24,015
I mean, we were basically
playing covers

311
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:25,449
of Dave Matthews songs.

312
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:27,818
So I guess you could say
Dave Matthews

313
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,387
was doing what we were doing.

314
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:31,789
Oh, to play in a band
like Mouse Rat

315
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:34,458
that brought such joy to so many

316
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:37,128
truly was a mitzvah.

317
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:39,330
I should mention
I'm a rabbi now.

318
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:41,032
For the full rockumentary, go to

319
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:44,402
TheJohnnyKarateSuperAwesome
MusicalExplosion.com.

320
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,203
And now, back to the show.

321
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:52,309
Every hero struggles
with failure,

322
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,578
faces something they cannot do.

323
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:56,847
Andy faced one of those moments
just a few years ago.

324
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:59,150
And I would've chugged
that entire gallon of milk

325
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:01,085
had I not started puking
out of nowhere.

326
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,753
No, you did not achieve
your dream

327
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:04,889
of becoming
a Pawnee police officer.

328
00:14:04,923 --> 00:14:05,923
Oh, right.

329
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:07,325
But you did create Burt Macklin,

330
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,927
a character who exemplifies
everything that is great

331
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:10,928
about law enforcement.

332
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:12,463
Take a look.

333
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:16,834
My name is rt Tyra.

334
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:24,909
I don't know
what the problem is, Sergeant.

335
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:27,011
Just drain the ocean.

336
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:41,959
Andy, on behalf of the entire
Pawnee Police Department,

337
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:43,861
I'd like to present you
with this genuine

338
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:45,429
- Pawnee police badge.
- Wow.

339
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:47,631
It's ensconced forever
in the shadowbox

340
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,266
- we made earlier.
- How about that?

341
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:51,869
No.

342
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,638
Son, we spent four days
making that.

343
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,808
This means so, so much to me.

344
00:14:57,843 --> 00:14:58,943
I'm a cop.

345
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:00,217
I should get some handcuffs too.

346
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:01,646
- Give me your cuffs, Randy.
- No, no, no.

347
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,880
- Give me your cuffs.
- It's an honorary title only.

348
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:04,582
- Stand down, sir.
- Stop it! Quit!

349
00:15:04,616 --> 00:15:05,983
Andy, now that you're
an official police officer...

350
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,585
He's not. I want to make
it clear... he's not.

351
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:10,454
You should be able to solve
the case of the missing guitar.

352
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:14,392
So grab your clue and head
on over to Professor Smartbrain.

353
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,995
Professor Smartbrain,
this piece of fabric

354
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,363
was found at the scene.

355
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:20,932
Look at it under your telescope.

356
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,032
Hmm.

357
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,068
It looks like there are
some tiny initials.

358
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:27,204
"J.C."?

359
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:30,341
President Jimmy Carter
stole my guitar?

360
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,542
But why?

361
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:34,345
I don't think
it's Jimmy Carter, buddy.

362
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,814
The champ is here!

363
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,618
Hi, kids, is everybody
having a great time?

364
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,654
I know I am!

365
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:45,156
John Cena in the house!

366
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,058
John Cena, you're my hero.

367
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:49,393
- Wait, you're Andy.
- Yeah, I'm Andy.

368
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:50,695
From the information I got,

369
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:52,430
I just assumed you'd be, like,
ten years old.

370
00:15:52,464 --> 00:15:54,965
- Thank you.
- Okay, great. Thank you.

371
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,568
Thank you so much, man,
for bringing martial arts

372
00:15:57,602 --> 00:15:59,737
and music to all the children...

373
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,005
Wait, wait,
what are you doing, man?

374
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,972
- Got you.
- Got me?

375
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:03,107
- What?
- He got my cuffs.

376
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:04,508
Wait.
What the hell is this?

377
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,310
John Cena, you're a great
inspiration, a true hero,

378
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:08,179
and this is the greatest moment
of my life.

379
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:09,146
But you're going down.

380
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:10,181
Going down?
What are you...

381
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:11,182
Whoa!
Hey, stop...

382
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,249
You stole Johnny Karate's guitar.

383
00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:13,564
I didn't steal his guitar, man.

384
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:14,685
I'm just doing this as a favor.

385
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,160
You're going
in the dunk tank, bud.

386
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,221
I don't want to go
in the dunk tank.

387
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:18,789
- Shut up.
- Is anybody in charge?

388
00:16:18,824 --> 00:16:20,358
A little help?

389
00:16:20,392 --> 00:16:23,160
And now it's time to celebrate
Andy Dwyer's greatest creation...

390
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:24,128
Johnny Karate.

391
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:29,500
He has brought so much happiness
to so many children

392
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:32,937
in southern Indiana that we
thought a piece of Johnny Karate

393
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:34,972
should stay here in Pawnee.

394
00:16:40,712 --> 00:16:45,583
♪ Everybody was
Kung Fu fighting ♪

395
00:16:45,617 --> 00:16:47,385
Raise it up.

396
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:51,589
♪ Those kicks were fast
as lightning ♪

397
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:54,025
This is awesome.
Can you believe it, babe?

398
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:57,728
♪ In fact, it was
a little bit fritening ♪

399
00:16:57,763 --> 00:17:00,798
That karate gi
will stay here forever.

400
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:03,367
Well, not here here,
because this studio

401
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,403
actually has a show
where divorced couples

402
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:06,837
work out their problems.

403
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,306
So that might be weird if that
thing was hanging over them.

404
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,473
But it'll be somewhere.

405
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:14,378
And the spirit will stay
with us forever.

406
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:17,181
Andy Dwyer's final good-bye
when we come back.

407
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,720
What powers us?

408
00:17:22,754 --> 00:17:24,689
What gives us the tools
to attain our goals,

409
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:28,192
face our fears, take
that next step into the unknown?

410
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:29,960
It's energy.

411
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,763
Verizon, Exxon, and Chipotle
are proud to announce

412
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,133
a cross-platform merger
of our three great brands.

413
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:38,536
Whether it's extending
your 6G coverage,

414
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,438
drilling natural gas
out of shale,

415
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:42,473
or perfecting
the chicken quesadilla,

416
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:45,843
we will give you the energy
to get you to the next level.

417
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:50,047
And with enough energy, America,
nothing can stop us.

418
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:53,184
The all-new
Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon...

419
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:56,428
proud to be one
of America's 8 companies.

420
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,235
I'd like to begin by saying
thank you

421
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:06,670
to anyone who has ever worked

422
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:10,273
on the Johnny Karate
Musical Explosion Show.

423
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:13,243
This has been the greatest job
I've ever had,

424
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:16,279
and today has been
the best day of my life.

425
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:18,415
And that's saying something.

426
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:21,051
I once found a rock that looked
exactly like Santa Claus...

427
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,653
hat and everything, so...

428
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:26,089
Before I say good-bye,
let's review our checklist

429
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:27,224
one last time.

430
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:29,459
We made something
with Carpenter Ron.

431
00:18:29,494 --> 00:18:31,762
We learned something
with Professor Smartbrain.

432
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:33,430
We karate chopped something...

433
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:35,365
old Mailman Barry's face.

434
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,301
And we tried something new,
even though it was scary to us,

435
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:40,237
with Leslie Knope.

436
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,773
That leaves just one more thing,

437
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,442
the most important one.

438
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:48,245
Be nice to someone.

439
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,714
And I think I know right now
who needs it the most...

440
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:55,519
my wife,
April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer.

441
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:57,621
Honey, come on out here.

442
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:58,889
Come here.

443
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:01,391
Babe.

444
00:19:01,426 --> 00:19:02,826
Hey, babe?

445
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,662
Wait!

446
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,264
Honey, where are you going?

447
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:09,066
Babe, hey, will you...

448
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,167
Hey, come here.

449
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:13,236
April, what's going on?

450
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:16,673
It's...

451
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:19,943
Every week, this show
is an amazing train wreck,

452
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:23,013
and you love doing it,
and you're the best host,

453
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,382
like, even better
than my all-time favorite host,

454
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,117
Tom Snyder, which is crazy.

455
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:29,052
And all those kids love you,

456
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:32,556
and you're doing
what you're meant to do.

457
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,891
And I can't be the person that
makes you lose what you love.

458
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,126
Yeah, but you're what I love.

459
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,295
You're the only reason
I have any of this.

460
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:41,164
You believed in me,
and you supported me.

461
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:43,400
You make me happy...

462
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:46,069
happier than I ever thought
I could be.

463
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:48,939
Without you,
I wouldn't be anything.

464
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,508
You're what keeps me going.

465
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:54,845
You're my
Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon.

466
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,981
As long as I'm with you,
I'm gonna be happy.

467
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:00,450
So we go to Washington, D.C.

468
00:20:00,485 --> 00:20:01,685
And then we figure out

469
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,888
the next cool and awesome thing
from there, okay?

470
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,159
Okay.

471
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:11,540
That was a very good
"Being Nice to Someone."

472
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,299
I did it.

473
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,797
I can go finish the show.

Hiya!

488
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:04,305
Good-bye, Pawnee.
I will miss you.

489
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:07,375
Guys?

490
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:08,376
Guys?

491
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,278
Guys!

492
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,613
Tarantula.

493
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:15,717
Could somebody get me
out of here, please?

494
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:17,185
I'll help you, John Cena.

495
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:18,920
No...
