1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,622
We're gonna have orchids
in all the pews, right?

2
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:23,545
Because orchids are Donna's
favorite flowers,

3
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:24,991
and she's my favorite flower.

4
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,559
Ha ha!
We real cute.

5
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:27,831
Of course there
are gonna be orchids.

6
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,567
Do you think this is my first
time working a side job

7
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:32,335
as a wedding planner
for a former co-worker?

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,567
- No?
- I'm so sorry.

9
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,071
I mostly have my rage problem
under control,

10
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:37,975
but planning is very stressful.

11
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:39,479
Please avoid my trigger words,

12
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:42,015
"flowers,"schedule,"vows,"

13
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:44,383
"bride,"groom,"food,"

14
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,951
"love,"happy,"church,"

15
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:48,789
"event,"wedding," and "Craig."

16
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:49,830
I am so sorry, Craig.

17
00:00:49,857 --> 00:00:51,719
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:51,753 --> 00:00:53,623
April, walk with me.

19
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:56,023
So I chose you
as my Maid of Honor because

20
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:57,759
you've become one
of my best friends,

21
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:59,263
- And I love you like a sister.
- Ew.

22
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:01,335
But also because you're tough.

23
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:02,703
My family arrives tonight.

24
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:04,199
I know.
And they're all set

25
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,807
with their welcome bags, and I
told your brother LeVondrious

26
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,407
that he is not welcome.

27
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:11,911
Good, but still, there's gonna
be 28 Meagles in one room,

28
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:13,647
which means
there's gonna be drama.

29
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:15,143
I will handle everything.

30
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:16,951
I actually care whether
you're having a good time

31
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:18,047
and are happy.

32
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:19,151
It's weird.

33
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:20,855
The Meagles
are a cold-blooded crew

34
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:22,823
of judgmental grudge-holders.

35
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:24,687
My cousin Winnie once forgot
to use a coaster

36
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:27,495
at my grandpa's house, and
he wrote her out of his will.

37
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:30,127
The last four Meagle family
Pictionary tournaments

38
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:31,599
ended at the hospital.

39
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,527
Legally, no more than
three Meagles are allowed

40
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,103
on an international flight
together.

41
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,599
But they give great gifts.

42
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:39,071
Gotta get that flatware.

43
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:50,638

00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:01,939
Tommy, I was at the nail salon
and I picked up

45
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:03,005
some geranium hand cream.

46
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:03,733
Do you wanna try it?

47
00:02:03,853 --> 00:02:06,211
Uh, yes.
Warm it up, please.

48
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:08,168
Oh, that smells nice.

49
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:09,178
I'm just gonna go
and make sure everything

50
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,484
is set for tonight, okay?

51
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,484
- All right, see you later.
- See you, Ron.

52
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:16,243
I've always liked that Lucy.
Glad things are going well.

53
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:17,124
Better than well.

54
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:18,334
And guess what I have planned
for tonight?

55
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:20,875
- No.
- As Donna's Butler of Honor,

56
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:21,709
I'm going all out.

57
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,165
Baby blue brocade.

58
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,810
As a surprise,
I got a matching dress for Lucy.

59
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:30,233
And do you believe Lucy will
be happy with this gift?

60
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,645
100%!
We're so in sync.

61
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:34,123
I finally feel like
I'm with the person

62
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:35,664
I'm gonna be with forever.
I'd marry her tomorrow.

63
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:38,100
Bully for you, son.
More importantly,

64
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,077
do you have tri-tip for tonight?

65
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,713
Because if not I brought my own.

66
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:45,837
I love weddings.

67
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,681
Good food, the celebration
of romantic love,

68
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,398
and most of all, churches.

69
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:52,730
Say what you will about
organized religion,

70
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:55,524
those bastards knew how to
construct an edifice.

71
00:02:57,412 --> 00:02:58,325
Okay, monsters.

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,392
Mommy and Daddy have to pack

73
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:02,593
because we are going to a hotel.

74
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:04,150
But Roz is gonna stay here
with you.

75
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,750
Yeah, and we are going
to have so much fun.

76
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:07,982
We're gonna play games,
we're gonna color,

77
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:11,127
maybe we're gonna even sit
quietly for 30 seconds.

78
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:14,160
Do you think
I could have 30 seconds?

79
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,632
- That's all.
- She's fading.

80
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,265
Roz, Roz, hey, hey,

81
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,633
you are a wonderful nanny.

82
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,433
- Oh.
- You're tough, and strong,

83
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:24,105
and you're an excellent
caretaker for our children.

84
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:25,473
Yeah, every time you
come to our house

85
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,240
we are so happy to see you.

86
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,743
I love you more than Ben.

87
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,206
I do.

88
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:33,342
If Ben left me, I would be sad,
but I would get through it.

89
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:36,016
But if you left me,
I would never recover.

90
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,785
Thanks.
That helps.

91
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,521
I'm so used to packing for them

92
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,855
I almost put in diapers
for myself.

93
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,089
Incoming call.

94
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,358
Jen Barkley.

95
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,726
Jen Barkley is calling again.
She is relentless.

96
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,162
Jen is a powerful
political operative.

97
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:52,825
Don't you even want
to know what she has to say?

98
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,896
She'll just say what she
always says, which is,

99
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:57,193
"Leslie, would you consider
running for state senate

100
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:58,634
or Congress?"
And I'll say,

101
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,099
"Jen, thank you very much,
that's very flattering,

102
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:04,507
but I love my job, and I get to
do it for the entire country."

103
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,138
The whole world is my park.

104
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,378
Besides, our lives are so
chaotic we can't run a campaign.

105
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:12,251
Well, if you really wanted
to do it, we'd find a way.

106
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,747
I mean,
things aren't that chaotic.

107
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,284
All three of them just bumped
into each other

108
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:17,956
and broke everything you own.

109
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,057
I... I don't know what that was.

110
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:25,392
Oh, would you look at that?

111
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:28,064
Sweetie, I think your best
friend Tom's

112
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,400
giving his ladyfriend a gift.

113
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:32,897
You know Gayle gives me a gift
each and every day.

114
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,869
Oh, I got
the greatest gift of all.

115
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,533
Being married to you.

116
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,372
Oh, sweetie.

117
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:42,003
Control yourselves, Gergiches!

118
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:44,204
Damn, Tommy, well done!

119
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:45,573
I knew you'd like it.

120
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:48,080
Get changed, baby, we gotta
dominate this party.

121
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:50,414
What do you think, Ron?
Tommy's the man.

122
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:53,350
I normally don't get involved
in people's personal affairs,

123
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:56,957
but something about a wedding...
I'll just say it.

124
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:59,556
Tom is quite taken with you.

125
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,291
He's taken with me, huh?

126
00:05:01,325 --> 00:05:02,258
Yes.

127
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:03,954
He said he'd marry you tomorrow.

128
00:05:06,794 --> 00:05:08,424
Seems silly to stay at a hotel

129
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,399
that's ten minutes
from our house.

130
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,494
Well, it's been three years.

131
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,293
We deserve one night away
together.

132
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:14,732
A little downtime,
little privacy,

133
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,626
maybe we make some more kids.

134
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:17,666
Don't even joke about that.

135
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,833
Let's just make, like,
three more,

136
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,367
so that each one of them
can have a friend.

137
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:23,063
Ugh.

138
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,535
Jen?
What are you doing here?

139
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:25,930
You idiots won't answer
my calls,

140
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:27,535
and what I have to tell you
cannot wait.

141
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,671
But...

142
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,110
What's that horrible sound?

143
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:31,309
Children.

144
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:34,013
Ugh, your life is gross.

145
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:35,444
My life is amazing.

146
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:36,812
Jen, thank you
so much for coming,

147
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:38,211
but we have to go.

148
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:41,250
I have never been late for
an event that requires an RSVP.

149
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:42,914
You guys live
in Pawnee, Indiana.

150
00:05:42,948 --> 00:05:43,984
Where do you have to go?

151
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:46,677
Putting up a new scarecrow?

152
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:48,578
Could you please
just get to the point?

153
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:49,945
Sure...
Paul Hartwell,

154
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:51,742
who's your congressional
incumbent from this district,

155
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,947
is a moron,
even by Washington standards.

156
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,743
But he wins every year,
because he's a horrible bully

157
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,875
and nobody opposes him.
Till now.

158
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,805
Indiana's 10th district
needs a new leader.

159
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,003
Someone who's made it a home,
who cares about our citizens,

160
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:06,842
and who understands
the local economy.

161
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:09,472
Jen, I told you, I have
a dream job, I don't want to...

162
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:12,143
A candidate named Ben Wyatt.

163
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,248
Sorry?

164
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,984
I'm dead serious, Ben.

165
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:18,415
I think you should run for
the House of Representatives.

166
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:19,582
Whoa!
What was that?

167
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:20,982
That was huge!

168
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:23,085
Hang on, this is Congress
you're talking about,

169
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:26,188
like, where bills become laws.

170
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:27,860
I am not qualified for that.

171
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:29,755
We're talking about the
House of Representatives, Ben.

172
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,026
You might be overqualified.

173
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,192
Hartwell's biggest weakness
is the economy,

174
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,390
which is your exact strength.

175
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:36,093
You're young, you're smart,

176
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:37,693
you're running the biggest city
in the district.

177
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:40,524
I saw you handle
that WiFi thing on TV.

178
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,960
My firm is ready to go as soon
as you say the word.

179
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:44,727
You in or you out?

180
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,522
Uh, Two of the three kids
are showering in their pajamas,

181
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:50,129
and most of Ben's ties
are in the toilet.

182
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:52,896
Just like, as an update
of where things are at.

183
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:54,327
I mean, this is chaos.

184
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:58,349
Guys, it happened
a really long time ago, right?

185
00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,885
And it was probably an accident.

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,821
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the Dig Dug
machine just unplugged itself

187
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,630
right before I was about to beat
his high score.

188
00:07:05,664 --> 00:07:07,396
Yeah, I'm sure
it was an accident.

189
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,524
Hey, status report?

190
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:10,963
The Meagles are weird.
The words that they say

191
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,003
sound passive,
but seem aggressive.

192
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:15,202
I feel like there should be
a term for that.

193
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:17,666
Like, "nicey-meanie."

194
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:21,001
Yeah, I just had to physically
separate two 80-year-old men

195
00:07:21,043 --> 00:07:23,375
who were arguing about whether
it was really Lena Horne

196
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,543
in that grocery store in 1970.

197
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:28,406
Okay, you stay on the Key Largo
and Denver Meagles,

198
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,510
and I will handle
the Berlin Meagles.

199
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:32,780
Done!

200
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:34,747
So you thinking
about Jen's offer?

201
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:36,778
Yes. I mean,
how would this even work?

202
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:40,849
Our lives are so busy, and if
I won, I would be a congressman.

203
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:42,520
Or woman.
I mean, equal rights.

204
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:44,184
No, that doesn't apply.

205
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:45,656
Okay.
Try this.

206
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,487
Tonight, just act like
you've decided to run.

207
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:50,558
And then tomorrow
at the wedding,

208
00:07:50,592 --> 00:07:52,220
act like you've decided
not to run.

209
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,691
See which one feels better.

210
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:57,226
Okay.
What do you think I should do?

211
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,858
Ben has to run.

212
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:00,625
I don't want to push it,
because it might backfire,

213
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:01,896
but he has to run.

214
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,231
He would be good for America,
good for the world.

215
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:07,796
Ben should be the Royal Archduke
Sultan Emperor

216
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,963
of All Inhabitable Lands
on Earth!

217
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:12,667
I'm completely neutral.

218
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,435
I will support you
no matter what you do.

219
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:19,371
You told Lucy
I want to marry her?

220
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,074
Damn it, son,
the small hamburgers.

221
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,114
Ron! You have to walk back
what you said.

222
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:24,885
Walk back sounds like lying.

223
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,917
Can you drop your strict life
codes for a second

224
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:28,117
and help me out?

225
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:29,684
Even though I've known Lucy
for years,

226
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,217
and can see myself spending
a life together with her,

227
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:34,552
having children, walking
the grounds of Tommy's Bahama...

228
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:36,822
a private island
I'll eventually buy...

229
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,925
that's way in the future, man.

230
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,460
Don't call me "man."

231
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:42,658
That's what you took away
from this?

232
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,657
Don't serve this man.

233
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,264
No more food until he fixes his
giant disaster he's created.

234
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,862
Okay, starting now,
you're in campaign mode.

235
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:53,333
So first up, meet and greet.

236
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,628
You remember
how this goes, right?

237
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:56,467
Your goal is to act like
everyone is interesting

238
00:08:56,501 --> 00:09:00,766
- and important.
- Hey, guys.

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,861
Nope, too hard.

240
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:04,865
- Let's try someone else.
- Okay.

241
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,263
Oh, there's Donna's parents.

242
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,261
- Okay?
- Okay.

243
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:08,596
- Work your magic.
- You got it.

244
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,226
Uh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Meagle,
I presume?

245
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,067
I am Mr. Meagle,
but we're divorced.

246
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,498
I'm Grace Callahan.

247
00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,202
Well, I'm sorry, Ms. Callahan.

248
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:21,170
It's Doctor Callahan.

249
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:24,040
Well, I hope that you are
a podiatrist or a dentist,

250
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:27,278
because I seem to have a case
of foot-in-mouth disorder.

251
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:32,139
Hey, guys.
How's everything going?

252
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:34,841
April, we couldn't be happier,
and you are an angel for asking.

253
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,881
Yeah, it's surprisingly
painless.

254
00:09:36,915 --> 00:09:40,551
No swiping,
no passive-aggressive comments.

255
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,318
No drama at all.

256
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:44,253
Here are all
the troublemakers, boss.

257
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:46,747
Thank you. Meagles!
I am not screwing around.

258
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:48,083
Okay?

259
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:49,881
Lauren,
no more discussion of Majorca.

260
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,488
Majorca is off limits.

261
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:53,551
Brian and Gloria,
stop making Horatio feel bad

262
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,786
- that your daughter went to Yale.
- No one gives a.

263
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:57,621
- And, Ginuwine?
- Yes?

264
00:09:57,654 --> 00:09:59,790
- Get it together.
- I'm sorry, April.

265
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:00,957
Kathy started this.

266
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,157
Kathy started...

267
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,524
I don't care!

268
00:10:03,558 --> 00:10:04,491
She doesn't mean it.

269
00:10:04,525 --> 00:10:05,730
Don't cry, Ginuwine.

270
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:07,594
It's okay.

271
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:09,530
Thanks, Andy.

272
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:11,401
Easy peasy.

273
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:14,599
Lemon sneezy.

274
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:17,898
Lucy,
I have something to tell you.

275
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:20,465
I am a liar.

276
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:21,766
What?

277
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,062
Well, no, I am not a liar.

278
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,469
I have never lied
about anything in my life.

279
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:29,470
Though I suppose you could
construe camouflage as a lie.

280
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,141
What is happening right now?

281
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:34,875
Tom wanted to convey
that he likes you a great deal.

282
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:37,944
So he said that he could imagine
marrying you.

283
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:39,741
And living on an island
with your kids.

284
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:43,644
Wait, now we're on an island?
With kids?

285
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:45,147
- Plural?
- Yes.

286
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:48,849
Now, do you know where I can
find those little ham balls?

287
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:51,018
Watch out for those riding
lawnmowers, man.

288
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:54,154
Babe, you are killing it!

289
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,784
I am, right?

290
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:57,152
- Yes!
- See, just thinking

291
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:59,591
I'm a congressman
makes me feel like one.

292
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:00,558
Yeah.

293
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:02,085
Oh, also,
I have a little secret.

294
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:03,492
I'm drunk.

295
00:11:03,526 --> 00:11:04,924
I am too.

296
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,260
Ever since we had our kids,
it only takes,

297
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:07,460
like, one sip of wine.

298
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:09,426
I feel so good
and "condifent."

299
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,694
- Mm-hmm.
- Con...

300
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:13,589
I feel "condifent."

301
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,751
You know what you should do?

302
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,123
You should give a toast.

303
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:17,595
Because if you were running
for Congress,

304
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:19,162
you have to give speeches,
right?

305
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,961
You want me to make a toast?
I'll toast it up.

306
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,529
Toast it, baby.
Roast it and toast it

307
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:24,800
till it's brown on both sides.

308
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,600
Hey, everybody.
I'm Ben Wyatt.

309
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:30,038
Listen, we, of course, are
here to celebrate Donna and Joe,

310
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:33,205
and I have to say, you know,
getting married is

311
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:36,509
the bravest,
most wonderful thing you can do.

312
00:11:36,543 --> 00:11:39,109
Because every day you come home
and you're just, like,

313
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:41,045
"What?

314
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,180
"It's you! I love you!

315
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:45,914
You're my sexy roommate.
We love each other."

316
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:48,048
Whoo!
He's talking about me.

317
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,647
Yes, I am, babydoll!

318
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:53,183
Look, Donna and Joe are great.

319
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:56,253
You all are great.

320
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,156
And this wedding
is gonna be amazing.

321
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,523
Let's get some music
and dancing going.

322
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:07,098
And I am Ben Wyatt, and I very
much approve this message!

323
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:14,834
You want me to shut that down?

324
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,305
No, I like it.

325
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:17,640
Let the little man dance.

326
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:18,904
Hey!

327
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,839
♪ It takes two to make
a thing go right ♪

328
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,475
Ah, my head.

329
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:28,043
Last night was so fun.

330
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:30,947
- But my head died.
- Yeah.

331
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:32,946
Yeah, mine's filled
with concrete.

332
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,777
Okay so...

333
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,249
Yesterday, you pretended
you were gonna run.

334
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:38,752
Today, you're gonna pretend like
you're not gonna run.

335
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:39,888
Oh, no.

336
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,255
Jen posted the campaign ad.

337
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:42,422
It's everywhere.

338
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:43,485
I'm running.

339
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,587
How could she do this to...

340
00:12:46,621 --> 00:12:48,050
Oh, God, I'm remembering things.

341
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,291
We called Jen last night,
didn't we?

342
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,058
- Yeah, we did.
- Ugh.

343
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:57,064
I also called 867-5309
100 times.

344
00:12:57,098 --> 00:12:58,760
Oh, God.

345
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:01,082
Bad.
What do we do?

346
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,294
There you are.
Surprise, surprise.

347
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:05,526
Whoa!

348
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:06,934
Oh, you guys should've
corner-boothed it.

349
00:13:06,968 --> 00:13:08,977
- 'Cause you look awful.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

350
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:10,262
You're gonna scare off
the other customers.

351
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:11,533
- Shh.
- Hey, Jen.

352
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:14,194
All those kids keep you up
all night?

353
00:13:14,236 --> 00:13:15,600
I'm so happy with my choices.

354
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:17,566
- Okay, Jen?
- Yeah?

355
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,099
Um, I know I left you
a message last night,

356
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,096
but I really do think you should
have checked with me

357
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,398
before throwing me into this.

358
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:25,965
No, Ben, I'm sorry,
you left me four messages

359
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,029
- last night.
- What?

360
00:13:27,063 --> 00:13:28,469
And they contained very specific

361
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,037
policy positions.

362
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:32,333
I want to come out strong
on education.

363
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,437
Then I'll tack hard
into fiscal responsibility.

364
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:37,644
- Oh, my God.
♪ 8-6-7-5-3-0-9 ♪

365
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:39,044
I love that song.

366
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:40,444
♪ Jenny, I've got your number ♪

367
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,413
Hey, babe, it's ringing!

368
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:46,380
Wow, honey, you were
a lot more lucid than I was.

369
00:13:46,414 --> 00:13:49,281
Wait, were you guys drunk?

370
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:51,384
That is hilarious.

371
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:52,783
- No, we weren't...
- Oh, you guys are gonna fit in

372
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:53,854
so great in Washington.

373
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:56,916
Most of Congress is drunk,
all of the time.

374
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,326
Okay, official presser
is tomorrow at 9:00.

375
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,324
You could bail if you want.

376
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,555
But it would be embarrassing.

377
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:02,586
It might derail your career.

378
00:14:02,628 --> 00:14:03,752
Might not.
Probably will.

379
00:14:03,794 --> 00:14:05,391
But you never do know though,
right?

380
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:07,725
So just let me know
what you want to do, okay?

381
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,021
- Will.
- I'm just gonna go

382
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:11,260
spend my time doing exactly
what I want to do,

383
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:13,427
because I don't have children.

384
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:17,330
Bye, guys.

385
00:14:17,364 --> 00:14:18,835
Ron?

386
00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:21,632
I'm Walden, with the Church's
historical archives.

387
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,302
You called about wanting
information on the building?

388
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:25,429
I did, indeed.

389
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,099
- Let's start with the facade.
- Mm.

390
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,865
Was the limestone
locally hand-hewn?

391
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:32,101
No.
In the late 1870s,

392
00:14:32,135 --> 00:14:35,530
it was actually cheaper to
import limestone from Michigan.

393
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:36,498
- Fascinating.
- Do you want to sit here?

394
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:37,571
- Or should I...?
- But tell me...

395
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:38,572
I'll do whatever you want.

396
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:40,141
I'm fine with whatever.

397
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:41,909
No.
Whatever you want.

398
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:43,709
No pressure.

399
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,908
Excuse me.

400
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,548
Oh, my God.

401
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:49,851
Oh, look at how beautiful
you look.

402
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:51,450
Leslie, I'm not even
in my dress yet.

403
00:14:51,484 --> 00:14:53,280
But you're gonna be very soon.

404
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:55,279
All right, I want to say
something to my girls.

405
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:58,485
Knope, you're a softie,
but on the inside,

406
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,546
you're a straight-up boss.

407
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:03,213
April, you're the exact
opposite.

408
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:06,315
Y'all inspire me and I love you.

409
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:08,248
And you, too, Michelle.

410
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,382
Michelle...

411
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:11,581
You were my best friend
from childhood.

412
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,945
Until we lost touch 'cause you
thought your college boyfriend

413
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,047
was into me.

414
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,343
He was.

415
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:18,279
I never gave him the time
of day.

416
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:21,552
But now, we're rebuilding
our friendship.

417
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:23,183
Is this wedding going to be
a test for you?

418
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:24,151
Yes.

419
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:25,559
But the doctors once told you

420
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:26,759
you were never going
to walk again.

421
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,758
So this should be easy, right?

422
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,755
Wow, what a complicated
tapestry that is.

423
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:36,026
Bring it in. Bring it in.
Bring it in.

424
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,226
Moment over.

425
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,792
Leslie, April, help Donna
with her dress.

426
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:40,495
Hi, I'm Typhoon.

427
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,964
Typhoon, I am interested,
but now is not the time.

428
00:15:42,998 --> 00:15:44,595
Michelle, get the bouquet.

429
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:46,298
You're skating on very thin ice.

430
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:52,470
I couldn't help but notice,
from afar,

431
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:55,203
that you are both acting
like weirdoes.

432
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:58,138
I further suspect you have not
yet talked about what happened.

433
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:01,073
What? I don't even know
what you're talking about

434
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:02,505
us having not talked about.

435
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:05,007
I only meant to say
that there's no shame

436
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:09,005
in declaring how you feel
to a person you cherish.

437
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,811
I am sorry if I caused
a problem.

438
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,378
Because the two of you make
a good team.

439
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:16,346
If you'll excuse me,
I missed out on the food,

440
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,617
and was denied a fascinating
conversation

441
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,647
about Michigan limestone.

442
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:22,950
But I'll be damned if I don't
properly honor the expression

443
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:26,251
of romantic love.

444
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,819
Ron does this weird thing

445
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:28,946
where he says exactly
what he means.

446
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,754
You just have to ignore him.

447
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:34,890
So you didn't mean
what you said?

448
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:37,656
Look, I'm all in.
That's all I meant.

449
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,088
I didn't want you to think
I was crazy

450
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,296
or jumping the gun.

451
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,789
And I know you just got out
of a relationship

452
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:43,755
so I don't expect you to feel
the same way.

453
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:46,657
But that's how I feel.

454
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:55,165
Well, I'm only dating you
for the free dresses, so...

455
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,069
I'm fine with that.

456
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,367
Donna, even though I've known
you for years,

457
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,870
I feel like I learn something
new about you every day.

458
00:17:05,904 --> 00:17:08,037
Just yesterday, I learned
that the Pearl Jam album,

459
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:11,109
Vitalogy was written about you.

460
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:14,476
You are an amazing, confident
woman.

461
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,075
And I love you.

462
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:20,144
I know that I can be a lot.

463
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:22,407
And a while back, I was thinking
I'd never find someone

464
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,543
who loved me for me.

465
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,982
But you're patient, and kind,

466
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:29,415
and together,

467
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,550
we can do anything.

468
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,316
You may now kiss the bride.

469
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:42,121
Hey, Roz.

470
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:43,855
Oh, okay.
We have the zebras.

471
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:45,969
Tell the kids not to worry,
they're coming back home.

472
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,051
Also, we want to give you
a raise,

473
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,787
and anything you want
to take from our house.

474
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,018
Okay, bye.

475
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,785
How in the world am I supposed
to run for office?

476
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:55,057
Our lives are like
one big unexpected

477
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:58,160
stuffed zebra emergency.

478
00:17:58,194 --> 00:17:59,958
I don't know.
What do you think I should do?

479
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,261
I told you.
I'm neutral.

480
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,563
Honey, you have never been
neutral on anything

481
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:04,563
in your life.

482
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:06,057
You have an opinion on pockets.

483
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:08,431
Yes, I think they should
all be bigger.

484
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:09,431
Okay.
Fine.

485
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,262
I think you should run.

486
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:12,830
Yes, our lives are bonkers.

487
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:16,733
But if something is worth it...
and I think this is...

488
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,501
then you just make it work.

489
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:21,404
Besides, I just read an article
on two-minute micro-naps,

490
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:22,836
and the science on them
is very promising.

491
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:23,939
Oh, hey!

492
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,507
Ben Wyatt.
Any comment on the report

493
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,978
that you're running
for Congress?

494
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:28,976
I'm sorry, I can't talk
about this right now.

495
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,143
Your only experience in politics

496
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,742
was as a failed mayor
at age 18...

497
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:34,278
Okay, please, everyone,
we're at a wedding.

498
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,309
And I'm holding zebras.

499
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:38,445
I mean, what qualifies you
to take over Hartwell's seat?

500
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,150
Guys, listen to me, please.

501
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:42,054
I'm dealing with an actual
problem right now.

502
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,822
Okay?

503
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:48,630
Which, by the way,
is what I do for a living.

504
00:18:48,664 --> 00:18:52,365
I solve problems
as a budget specialist,

505
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,628
and for five years
as a City Manager,

506
00:18:53,662 --> 00:18:55,227
and I'm pretty good at it.

507
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:57,760
I have worked hard
to transform this area

508
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:59,695
into a fiscally sound
destination

509
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:02,462
for people who want good jobs,
and a good public education,

510
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:04,469
and I think the results speak
for themselves.

511
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,874
My name is Ben Wyatt,
and I'm running for Congress.

512
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,977
Oh, my God, babe,
that was so hot.

513
00:19:16,547 --> 00:19:18,441
- Donna.
- Hey.

514
00:19:18,475 --> 00:19:19,840
How did I do?

515
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:23,077
Everything was perfect.
You are a miracle worker.

516
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:26,114
But I gotta say I kind of miss
the Meagle drama.

517
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,849
I thought for sure somebody
was gonna do something crazy.

518
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:31,015
But everybody's just nice
and chill.

519
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:33,182
Anyway, I love you,
and to thank you,

520
00:19:33,216 --> 00:19:35,444
- I'm gonna try not to hug you.
- Thank you.

521
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:36,914
- I'm going to...
- No!

522
00:19:36,948 --> 00:19:40,553
Okay, okay.

523
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:43,816
Wyatt, why didn't you tell us
you're running for congress?

524
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:46,686
Well, we didn't want to
steal your thunder.

525
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,157
Steal my thunder?

526
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:49,357
I'm sorry, have you seen how
I'm wearing this dress?

527
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:51,421
Okay,
well in that case,

528
00:19:51,462 --> 00:19:53,722
uh, yes, I am.

529
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:56,489
All right!

530
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,826
- To Ben.
- Donna and Joe.

531
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,427
To me.
I own my own restaurant

532
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:01,732
and several other properties.

533
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:05,204
- That's always worth celebrating.
- Hear hear.

534
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,573
Who's Garry?

535
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:09,144
Oh, I think that's
supposed to be me.

536
00:20:09,178 --> 00:20:11,546
Ha ha. That's your new name.
Garry.

537
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:15,016
- Garry!
- Garry! Garry! Garry!

538
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,057
- Garry! Garry!
- "Hi, I'm Garry!"

539
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,090
Garry is my real name.

540
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:21,729
Yes, after 30 years,
my coworkers are finally

541
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,024
going to call me
by my real name.

542
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:27,062
Oh, boy, I'm blessed.

543
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:29,860
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please.

544
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:32,697
Now it's time for a surprise
musical guest,

545
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,996
One of my time favorites...
me.

546
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:41,194
♪ I had a girl ♪

547
00:20:41,235 --> 00:20:44,098
♪ Donna was her name... ♪

548
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,337
Donna! Joe!

549
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,166
I hope you saved a slice
of that cake

550
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,836
for your estranged brother
LeVondrious!

551
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,710
What's up, girl?

552
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:59,174
Didn't expect to see your baby
bro at your wedding, huh?

553
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,511
Well, I'm here...

554
00:21:00,545 --> 00:21:02,386
despite what you did to me
all those years ago.

555
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:03,719
What I did?

556
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:05,415
This is because of what you did.

557
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:07,254
Oh, you must be referring
to the microwave incident.

558
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:09,117
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.

559
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,552
I brought it back.

560
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,024
Well.

561
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:19,254
Now no one gets any popcorn.

562
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:23,358
You said you wanted
a little drama.

563
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,629
That's why I love you, girl!

564
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:31,675
