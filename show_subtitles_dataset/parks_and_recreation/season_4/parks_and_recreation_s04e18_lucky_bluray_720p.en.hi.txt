1
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:05,364
It's my new interview outfit.

2
00:00:05,409 --> 00:00:06,977
Like, "hey,
nice to meet you."

3
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:08,111
Can't wait
for the interview."

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:09,645
Um, I... maybe the h...

5
00:00:09,713 --> 00:00:11,013
- maybe the hat.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:12,214
Lose this?

7
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:14,149
To win an election,
you have to be good,

8
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:15,417
and you have to be lucky.

9
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:18,720
Buddy Wood hosts the number-one
morning show in Indianapolis,

10
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:21,190
and he wants to interview me
for a series he's doing

11
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:22,591
on local elections.

12
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:25,627
And last year the five people
that he profiled all won.

13
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,095
This is a huge break for us.

14
00:00:27,162 --> 00:00:28,997
Um... hey.

15
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:31,665
M-maybe we should put a pause
on the fashion show.

16
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,368
We have to go over
your talking points.

17
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:35,370
Keep going.
I can still hear you.

18
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:38,006
Um, okay, Ms. Knope,
what is going to be

19
00:00:38,073 --> 00:00:40,341
your first major
public works project?

20
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:41,609
Oh, I don't know.

21
00:00:41,676 --> 00:00:44,811
But I bet these pants
will work for the public.

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,014
- Whoo!
- Yeah, those pants look dope!

23
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,282
- Right?
- Oh, my God, those look great.

24
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,950
And I bet they look even better
on Ben's floor.

25
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,652
- Oh!
- Are you hitting on Leslie...

26
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,054
Wait a second.

27
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:55,922
Just turn around.

28
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,491
What?

29
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:58,825
Oh.

30
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,192
It says "Nympho"
on the butt

31
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,527
in silver, sparkly letters.

32
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,429
Nympho means
you're addicted to sex,

33
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,463
and since it's on the butt,

34
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,332
there's other implications
as well.

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,100
So those are a maybe.

Who was Laura Mulvey?

39
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:33,123
Laura Mulvey was...

40
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,824
- A guy...
- Girl.

41
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:36,193
Right. Women's studies.

42
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:37,528
They're all girls.

43
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:40,064
Laura Mulvey was a feminist
film critic who...

44
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,532
Wrote a major essay
that helped shift

45
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,501
the orientation
of film theory

46
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,336
to the psychoanalytical
framework!

47
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:48,071
Treat, please.

48
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:49,405
I'm about to take
my first-ever final

49
00:01:49,473 --> 00:01:50,573
for my women's studies class.

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,574
Treat!

51
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:52,908
Usually, tests scare me,

52
00:01:52,976 --> 00:01:55,044
but this is an oral exam.

53
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:58,881
Uh, and if there's
one thing I know is...

54
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:02,485
My fantastic...
it's talk.

55
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:04,419
God, I don't know.
Man, I'm so nervous.

56
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:06,254
I know... I'm just gonna
call the Professor,

57
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:07,622
and then I'm gonna
get on the phone

58
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,990
and make
some fake barfing sounds,

59
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:10,825
and then I'm just gonna bail,
so give me my phone.

60
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:12,327
No! Andrew...

61
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:14,463
That's now how grown-ups
handle tough situations.

62
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,365
- Well, I...
- We face our fears head-on.

63
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:19,166
Told you... if you can't
remember what some woman did,

64
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:21,668
just tear up and say,
"she changed my life."

65
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:24,105
Ah, that's a good call.

66
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:25,873
I think this is it.

67
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,908
But do I need a hat,
like a bowler,

68
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:29,410
or an edgy scarf?

69
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:30,844
No, those endless scarves

70
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:32,413
that come out of your sleeves
like a magician.

71
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:35,082
Um... I think you should just
go with something basic...

72
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:36,116
No nonsense.

73
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:38,918
Mr. Wood, hello.

74
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:41,754
God, he is more tightly wound
than ever.

75
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:43,756
Maybe we should see if he can
pull that rod out of his butt

76
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:45,291
and we can hang
some of those outfits on it.

77
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:48,894
Ann and I have
the occasional rough patch

78
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:50,196
in our relationship.

79
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:52,931
But right now,
we're really in a groove.

80
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,601
We've gone 30 hours
without breaking up.

81
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:57,902
Our personal best
is 47 hours.

82
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,239
It happened when she was
out of town for two days

83
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:02,641
and she forgot
we were dating.

84
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,643
Well, let me know
if anything changes.

85
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,545
Thank you.

86
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,580
- Interview's off.
- What?

87
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,249
Buddy has to fly back
to Indianapolis early...

88
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,484
something about
a factory explosion.

89
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:14,985
Come on, did anyone
even get hurt?

90
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:16,420
Sorry.

91
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,756
First stroke of luck
we've had, and it's gone.

92
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:21,159
Okay, well, we just
have to work harder.

93
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:22,826
I mean, good news is,
we can call it a night

94
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:25,428
and get a super-early start
on our door-to-door tomorrow.

95
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,930
Ooh, that is great news.

96
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,066
And, you know, we might even
be able to make it back

97
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:30,367
in time for boring club.

98
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:32,069
Do you know who the president
or boring club is?

99
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:33,436
Me?

100
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,072
Nope...
You lost the election

101
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,707
'cause your speech
was too boring.

102
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,508
Hey, why don't we all
go get a drink,

103
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:39,876
blow off some steam?

104
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:41,744
Everybody's been
working so hard.

105
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:44,180
Um... Well, we're
in the homestretch here,

106
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:46,315
and losing that interview
didn't help.

107
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,017
I'm gonna go over
some polling numbers

108
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:49,052
and turn in early.

109
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,486
I suggest you do the same.

110
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:52,588
Hey, Leslie,
give you a ride home?

111
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:54,223
Ah, screw it.

112
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,624
I got a new outfit.
My hair looks amazing.

113
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:59,444
And I have a serious excess
of pre-interview adrenaline.

114
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:00,912
Who's gonna drink with me?

115
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,880
- Ooh...
- Oh...

116
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,916
Susan Bronwell, or B.,
Anthony...

117
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:07,385
was born in Adams,
Massachusetts, in 1820,

118
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:09,220
and she played a pivotal role

119
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:11,256
- in the institution of women's suffrage.
- Andy...

120
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:12,856
- Treat, please.
- Andy, slow down.

121
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:14,558
You're taking this class
pass/fail.

122
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,394
So I'm just looking
for a freewheeling discussion

123
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:19,296
about, you know, what you
got from the class.

124
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:20,864
Oh. Okay.

125
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:24,969
I would say
what I find very cool

126
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:28,104
about Susan B. Anthony is...

127
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:30,106
How...

128
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:33,642
She was born
in Adams, Massachusetts,

129
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,411
in 1820.

130
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:36,612
You know?

131
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,781
Just one man's opinion.

132
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:40,716
I passed!
I got a "P"!

133
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:42,918
- Congrats, babe.
- Yeah! Mmm!

134
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:46,588
I was hoping for a P-plus,
but that does not exist.

135
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:47,856
- Right?
- Right.

136
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:50,058
Yes, so, basically,
best grade in the class...

137
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:51,393
tied for the best grade
in the class.

138
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,928
Ron, I am
a college graduate now.

139
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,730
- No, you're not.
- I'm a college course...

140
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,499
Graduate, and it's all
because of you.

141
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:58,933
It's my pleasure, son.

142
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:00,434
I'm really proud of you.

143
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:01,635
How about a steak?

144
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:03,737
- Yeah!
- You guys have a good time.

145
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,539
Oh, Professor,
why don't you come with us?

146
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,740
- Is that cool?
- Sure.

147
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,609
We'll let you pay
for your own food,

148
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,111
because of equality.

149
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:12,046
I guess now that the class
is over,

150
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:13,714
there's nothing wrong
with it.

151
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:16,016
Are you gonna wear that?

152
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,617
Okay, I'm calling it.

153
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,952
I have a date
with my bathtub,

154
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,222
a glass of red wine,

155
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,524
and a gigantic fireman
named Marcus.

156
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,993
I'm gonna keep plugging
away for a bit.

157
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,164
You don't mind this work,
do you?

158
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,899
Uh-uh.
I like it.

159
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,802
It makes sense to me.

160
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,608
Mmm. This was such
a good idea.

161
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,609
Should we get another round?

162
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,445
Um...
I think we should get

163
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,913
a more basic,
no-nonsense beverage.

164
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,383
Uh... maybe we should all
just drink

165
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,018
sensible portions of milk.

166
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:55,986
I mean, I love him.
It's just...

167
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,590
This campaign has turned
fun, dorky Ben

168
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:03,361
- into grumpy, stress-ball Ben.
- Mm.

169
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,395
It's like dealing
with a strict mother

170
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:09,366
who I am confusingly
attracted to.

171
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:11,034
- Mm.
- Ben is like a MILF.

172
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:13,036
You just need
to blow off some steam.

173
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:14,671
- He should just get that.
- Yeah.

174
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:16,306
- You're Leslie Knope!
- Right!

175
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:18,575
No one takes this
more seriously than you do!

176
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:20,342
- Tell me about it!
- Yes!

177
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,079
- Tequila shots?
- Ohh!

178
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:25,181
To Knope 2012.

179
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:26,549
Mm.

180
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:27,583
Ahh.

181
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,017
Ding-dong.

182
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,553
Oh.

183
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,554
Hello. Lady Knope.

184
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:32,555
I mean Leslie Knope.

185
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,823
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Ben.

186
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,058
Where are you?

187
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,526
I'm in, uh, the house
watching TV right now.

188
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:40,761
I'm watching, um...
Murder She Wrote.

189
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:42,763
Murder She Wrote.
I'm watching Murder She Wrote.

190
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,233
Amazing news... Buddy Wood's
flight was delayed.

191
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:46,902
So, if we can get
to the airport right now,

192
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,205
the interview's back on.

193
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,905
What? Wow!

194
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,006
Whay could be wrong with that?

195
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:54,208
Nothing.

196
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,609
Anyway, here comes me...

197
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,943
- To the airport.
- Great.

198
00:06:57,011 --> 00:06:59,079
I'll see you there...
as soon as possible.

199
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:00,214
Okay, bye.

200
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:01,348
The interview is back on!

201
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,283
- Whoo! Yes!
- I know!

202
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:05,719
We are so "drucky."
I mean "lunky."

203
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:13,519
Ok, both the cabs in this town
are busy.

204
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,772
But I still had eight hours
rental time

205
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,107
on that hot-tub limousine that
I got for your campaign event,

206
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:20,109
- and it's on its way.
- That's smart.

207
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,477
You're smart.

208
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:23,812
Diddly diddly diddly
diddly swag.

209
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,148
- You did it right!
- I did it right.

210
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:27,282
- Ah!
- Ha ha!

211
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,651
33 hours.

212
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:32,387
Okay, look, this interview
is a big deal, you guys.

213
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:34,656
This is a game changer, okay?
I have to do well.

214
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:37,025
Listen, let's do
practice interview...

215
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:38,159
Big idea, Ann.

216
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:40,661
- And see how you do.
- Let's go.

217
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,430
Leslie,
in your humble opinion...

218
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:44,665
What?

219
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:48,135
- Why are you from Russia?
- I don't know.

220
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:50,070
Hey, Ron is the guy
I wrote about

221
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,457
for that paper on positive
male role models.

222
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:56,191
Oh, yeah, that was one
of your most readable papers.

223
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,094
According to Andy,
you're quite the feminist.

224
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:01,464
I don't consider myself
an anything-ist,

225
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,400
but my life has been shaped
by powerful women.

226
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,736
My father
once told my mother

227
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,771
that woman was made
from the rib of Adam,

228
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,905
and my mom broke his jaw.

229
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,140
My Uncle Lon once
tried to...

230
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:13,575
Is that Chris?

231
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,477
You know,
it really looks like him.

232
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:17,579
But there's no way
to know for sure.

233
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:19,648
We should ask him tomorrow.

234
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,584
Hey.

235
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:23,885
April Ludgate.

236
00:08:23,952 --> 00:08:25,720
Why are you here
eating alone?

237
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:28,622
I'm not.
I'm surrounded by friends...

238
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,890
Friends I don't know yet.

239
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,493
And I'm engrossed
in this book.

240
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,495
It's the true story
of a woman born

241
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:36,129
with no arms and no legs

242
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:38,165
who attempted to swim
the English Channel.

243
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:40,768
- That's impossible.
- Oh, she drowned immediately.

244
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:42,335
It's kind of a sad story.

245
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:44,069
Cool.

246
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:47,006
I'm over there with people
you actually know...

247
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,508
If you want
to come join us.

248
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,510
Thank you.

249
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,178
Bye, friend.

250
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:53,379
Bye.

251
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:00,084
I'm sorry, Marcus, I'm gonna
have to cancel our bath.

252
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:01,787
Something interesting
is happening.

253
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:03,221
I want to watch it.

254
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,289
I don't know, Marcus.

255
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,491
I'll hit you up
when I hit you up.

256
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:18,669
Wow, I feel totally normal.
I'm ready to do this.

257
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:21,472
Thank you for accommodating us
on such short notice.

258
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,307
Hey, for Leslie Knope,
anytime.

259
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,075
Just let me know if you
need anything else, all right?

260
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:27,478
Thanks, Paul. Hey, you got
those new I.D. Badges.

261
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:29,079
They finally upgraded us...

262
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:31,247
- security swipe and everything.
- Wow, look at that.

263
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:32,282
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

264
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,733
Hey, thanks again
for fighting for them.

265
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:35,435
"Helpy" to hop out.

266
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,304
Leslie Knope.
Buddy Wood.

267
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:38,939
- Buddy Wood.
- Glad you could make it.

268
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:39,940
Glad you could make it.

269
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:41,241
Thank you so much
for being here,

270
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,210
and welcome to the greatest
city in the world.

271
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,379
Oh.

272
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,579
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're being serious.

273
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:49,415
We're setting up over there,
found a small piece of carpet

274
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,918
without a horrifying
smellscape.

275
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:53,152
I'll be right there.

276
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,553
Hey, do I seem normal
to you?

277
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:55,888
Like, does everything
seem fine?

278
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:57,256
- Yeah, yeah... you seem fine.
- I seem okay?

279
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:58,424
- Uh-huh.
- I don't seem distracted

280
00:09:58,491 --> 00:09:59,758
or babbly or anything?

281
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:01,693
No, it's great.
So you're gonna do great.

282
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:04,062
- You're gonna do smart.
- What's that?

283
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,763
- Look who I found.
- Hi.

284
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:06,898
Professor Linda,
this is Chris.

285
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:08,766
Chris, this is...
Professor Linda?

286
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,635
It is a genuine pleasure
to meet you.

287
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:11,903
- Oh, you as well.
- Hi, there.

288
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,405
Would you like to hear
our specials?

289
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:14,439
No need.

290
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:15,941
Porterhouse, rare,
quickly.

291
00:10:16,508 --> 00:10:17,475
Same.

292
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:19,076
I'll have
the, uh, spinach salad.

293
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,477
What kind of dressings
do you have?

294
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:21,946
Oh! Linda, in case
you're interested,

295
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:23,280
I brought my own dressing.

296
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:24,848
You really
can't be doing that.

297
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,317
Well, this is the last time.
I promise.

298
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:28,218
It contains
extra-virgin olive oil,

299
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:30,421
a little bit of lemon,
and hint of turmeric.

300
00:10:30,988 --> 00:10:32,021
Sounds great.

301
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:36,642
Pawnee, Indiana,

302
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,044
home to
the Sweetums Candy Corporation,

303
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:42,347
19 toxic-waste repositories,
and not much else.

304
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,783
This sleepy mini-Metropolis

305
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,519
is the site of a fascinating
city council race.

306
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:48,721
Joining us today is one
of the candidates, Leslie Knope.

307
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,355
Leslie, welcome...
to Good Morning.

308
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,157
It's my pleasure.

309
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:55,627
Thank you for being
on my show.

310
00:10:55,694 --> 00:10:58,362
Leslie, we're here
at the Pawnee municipal airport,

311
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,166
which I must add is...
rather decrepit.

312
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:04,268
Well, I'm glad
you mentioned it.

313
00:11:04,336 --> 00:11:06,870
It is in desperate need
of refurbishments.

314
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,272
And that is why I'm going
to make it a centerpiece

315
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,508
- of my platform.
- Okay.

316
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:13,944
Take, uh...
Joe Appledemas over there.

317
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:15,145
Joe, say hi.

318
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:16,313
Hello.

319
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,582
Joe has been working here
since 1996,

320
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,350
and his salary
has not been raised a nickel.

321
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,919
I am gonna work
very hard to change...

322
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:26,188
Okay, this airport seems to me
like a metaphor.

323
00:11:26,256 --> 00:11:27,723
Are you familiar
with the term?

324
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,827
Pawnee's airport is symbolic
of the town...

325
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,429
out of touch,
out of date, perhaps,

326
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:35,865
lost, insignificant,

327
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,733
and sad.

328
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:39,434
Your thoughts?

329
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:41,302
Well, granted,

330
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,037
we don't have
big-city amenities,

331
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:44,372
but I think
we more than make up for it

332
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,875
with friendly faces
and hand-working hards...

333
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:47,943
hardworking hands.

334
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,711
If you say so.
I say it's sad.

335
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,613
Moving on...

336
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:54,315
Oh, my God.

337
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:55,483
If they got together,

338
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,451
they would make
the most beautiful super baby.

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,419
It would rule us all.

340
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:03,290
But what if super baby
became too powerful?

341
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:05,493
I guess we'll just have
to take that chance.

342
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,495
Chris got dumped
by Jerry's daughter.

343
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,663
He needs this.

344
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:11,564
Plus, if they get married,

345
00:12:11,632 --> 00:12:12,866
he'll spend
all his time with her,

346
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:16,235
and I might never have
to talk to him again.

347
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,837
Hmm.

348
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,072
Professor Linda,
you have...

349
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,641
Really nice arms.

350
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,142
- Oh?
- Do you work out?

351
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,777
I was gonna say
the exact same thing.

352
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:27,345
But I didn't want you to think
that I was objectifying you

353
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,981
with my male gaze.

354
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:29,982
May I see?

355
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,149
Oh, sure.

356
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,118
Oh, my good gracious.
You have...

357
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,721
- extraordinary caput laterale.
- Thank you.

358
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,990
There's nothing more important
than physical health.

359
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,591
- I agree.
- Kendra?

360
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:40,792
- Yes?
- You know what?

361
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,927
I am gonna have
that third steak after all.

362
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,163
Go ahead and put that order in
now, please, and thank you.

363
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:47,765
Your campaign hit
a snag of sorts,

364
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,100
with the revelation that you
and your boss, Ben Wyatt,

365
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:52,302
were having
une affaire de coeur...

366
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,771
affair of the heart.

367
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,272
Well, I've discussed that
many times,

368
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,508
and there's really
nothing more to say.

369
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,775
I would rather talk
about the ways

370
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:00,309
to solve problems
in this town.

371
00:13:00,377 --> 00:13:01,711
Good luck with that.

372
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,513
But getting back
to your affair with Ben Wyatt,

373
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:05,148
who's now
your campaign manager...

374
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:06,616
Buddy, frankly,
I don't want to discuss that.

375
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:08,218
But if you'd like,
we can talk about ways

376
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:11,588
that I can improve the airport
or our many wonderful parks.

377
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:12,322
I don't.

378
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,057
I'd like to talk
about you and Ben Wyatt.

379
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:16,425
Uh-oh.
I know that look.

380
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:17,760
- She's got the crazy eyes.
- Yeah.

381
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:18,894
Well, like I said,

382
00:13:18,962 --> 00:13:20,495
I don't want
to discuss it, Buddy,

383
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:22,497
and, frankly, I don't appreciate
your condescending tone.

384
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:23,766
But you know what?

385
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,634
I've had a couple drinks,
so what the hell?

386
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:27,135
Ben and I first...

387
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:28,904
I'm sorry, Ms. Knope,

388
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,838
are you inebriated?

389
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,174
What? No.
Preposterous.

390
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:35,242
- Are you ine...
Ebriated?

391
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,844
That was bad timing.

392
00:13:36,912 --> 00:13:39,447
This is a Buddy Wood first...
an exclusive interview

393
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:41,182
with potential city councilwoman
Leslie Knope,

394
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:43,084
who appears to be drunk
right now on camera.

395
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:44,619
I am not drunk.

396
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,287
Yes, when you have
a jumbo Margarita

397
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:49,556
and some flaming Tequila
shots, you can get drunk.

398
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:51,391
Is it this sad,
pathetic town

399
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:54,027
that makes you drink
this way?

400
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:56,763
- This interview is over.
- Okay, Ms. Knope.

401
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:57,965
Oh...

402
00:13:58,032 --> 00:13:59,933
This... this is not
because I'm drunk.

403
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,969
This is because of the wire.

404
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:05,037
A fitting end
to a bizarre interview

405
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,438
and a sad moment

406
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:09,008
in a depressing city
with no hope,

407
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:12,678
in the waning moments
of the bitter saga

408
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:16,115
that has been
a contentious campaign.

409
00:14:17,146 --> 00:14:19,015
C'mon Buddy,
you cannot air that tape.

410
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,343
Are you kidding?
This is as great for me

411
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,044
as it is terrible for you.

412
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:24,679
The sheep that watch my show

413
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:27,014
are gonna eat this up
like tiramisu.

414
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,649
Tiramisu is
an Italian dessert often...

415
00:14:28,717 --> 00:14:29,883
I know what
tiramisu is, okay?

416
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,985
- And sheep don't eat it.
- Sorry, but...

417
00:14:32,053 --> 00:14:35,188
Tomorrow morning
this gets broadcast

418
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:38,291
around the entire
Indiana-sphere.

419
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:43,397
Thank you for celebrating

420
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:47,467
the most ultimate triumph
of my life.

421
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:52,104
I'm very proud of me,
and you are too.

422
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:55,174
And, Professor, I'm taking
your class again next semester.

423
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:56,843
And I'm gonna lock down
that P-plus.

424
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,478
It's impossible.

425
00:14:58,545 --> 00:15:01,513
You and the women taught me
that nothing is impossible.

426
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:02,781
Alright, I better be going.

427
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:04,082
- I have to get up early.
- Good-bye.

428
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:06,284
I'm teaching a morning
Zumba class for retirees.

429
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,621
Before I do,

430
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:12,123
Linda, do you enjoy
land kayaking?

431
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:13,291
It's quite fun.

432
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,494
Well, it's more grueling
than fun.

433
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,194
But I would love
to take you.

434
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:18,562
I'm really flattered,

435
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,197
but I just got
out of a relationship,

436
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:21,999
and I think
I need a little more time

437
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,167
before I jump into anything.

438
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,369
Of course.
I understand.

439
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:27,638
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate your caution.

440
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:29,840
- Thank you.
- I hope to see you again.

441
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:31,475
Good-bye, everyone.

442
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:34,512
Anybody want to go to JJ's
for some after-dinner omelets?

443
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,080
Or how about you and I
go back to my place?

444
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:39,482
Yes.

445
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,521
Wow!

446
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:47,490
Ben, I am so sorry.

447
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:49,157
Let's just focus
on the problem.

448
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,659
Now, if we don't stop
that interview

449
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:53,028
from airing in the morning,
this campaign is dead.

450
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,463
So...

451
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:56,331
We have to go
to Indianapolis.

452
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,366
- And do what?
- I don't know, Tom.

453
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,536
I guess we'll just set fire
to the studio or something.

454
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:02,304
Ah, that's so sweet...
I've never had a boyfriend

455
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:04,505
threaten to commit arson
for me before.

456
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:05,573
Ah, it gets old.

457
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:06,707
We still have
six hours of rental time

458
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:08,008
on the hot-tub limo.

459
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:09,076
We could take that.

460
00:16:09,144 --> 00:16:10,445
No one would have to drive
all night.

461
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:11,946
That's actually a good idea.

462
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,348
Plus, it allows
for the possibility

463
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,183
of high-speed skinny-dipping.

464
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,118
Ugh.

465
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,720
Ann, I was joking.
Come on, it was a joke.

466
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,589
It was funny.

467
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,090
Where we going, folks...

468
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:25,625
drive around,
hit the strip clubs?

469
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,126
- Yeah!
- No.

470
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,697
We're going to this address
in Indianapolis.

471
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,699
- Really?
- Yeah.

472
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,968
You know, no one ever used
this hot-tub limo

473
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,336
for actual transportation.

474
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:37,903
And I can't take this thing
on the highway,

475
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:39,404
so it'll take
a few extra hours.

476
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,274
Hey, is this
a seven or a one?

477
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:49,482
Jerry.

478
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:52,284
Jerry!

479
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:54,318
Maybe you should wrap it up.
It's 4:00 in the morning.

480
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:55,653
Is it really?

481
00:16:55,721 --> 00:16:57,922
Oh, my gosh.

482
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,958
Wow.
Well, that flew by, huh?

483
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:01,893
I will just take these
down to the post office

484
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:04,462
and, uh, put the, uh...

485
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,832
Oh, jeez.
Oh, no.

486
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,669
I put the handout flyers
in the mailing envelopes,

487
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:15,772
and I was supposed to put
these flyers in the envelopes.

488
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,340
Oh...

489
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:20,243
My God.

490
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,713
Well, you know,
it's like I always say.

491
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,549
It ain't government work if you
don't have to do it twice.

492
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:27,650
Here we go!

493
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:30,686
I'll make some coffee.

494
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:32,588
Hey, you're blocking
my driveway.

495
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:36,759
Leslie Knope?

496
00:17:36,827 --> 00:17:37,927
- What are you doing?
- Hi, um...

497
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:39,762
Mr. Wood, I'm so sorry.

498
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,764
We... oh, my God, I can't see.
It's so bright out here.

499
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:45,600
- Ohh.
- We drove here to ask you...

500
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:48,269
No, to beg you
to please destroy that tape.

501
00:17:48,337 --> 00:17:49,938
Yeah, I got
your 50 messages.

502
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:52,140
Leslie was just out with her
friends blowing off some steam.

503
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:53,842
- What?
- Please. Please.

504
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,276
Please, please, please.

505
00:17:55,344 --> 00:17:56,444
That's five pleases.

506
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:57,778
As much as I enjoy
the groveling,

507
00:17:57,846 --> 00:17:59,880
I can't destroy the tape
because I don't have it,

508
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:02,650
because your sad,
tiny backwater airport

509
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,152
lost my bags.

510
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,654
Oh, really?

511
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,121
You'd think
a commuter airport

512
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:10,057
could handle the luggage
of 11 people at once,

513
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,491
but apparently not.

514
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,192
Completely ruined
a great story.

515
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,662
Thank God for that
mitten factory tragedy.

516
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:16,663
- Yeah.
- Mm.

517
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,830
- God, that's...
- Okay.

518
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:19,365
- Great. Uh...
- We should... yeah.

519
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,934
- We're gonna go.
- Good-bye.

520
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,239
Ah, screw it.

521
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,507
Yay!

522
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,476
Fun Ben lives.

523
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:37,049
April, Andrew...

524
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,316
Good morning
to you both.

525
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:39,818
Doughnuts...
go nuts.

526
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,556
Hey, you kids
need any money?

527
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,490
- No.
- Go buy yourself a Walkman.

528
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,025
How much is a Walkman
nowadays?

529
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,227
Probably more than $20.
Here's $25.

530
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,096
Hi, guys,
I just wanted to come by

531
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,732
and thank you
for a phenomenal evening.

532
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,069
Yeah, seems like we all
had a phenomenal evening.

533
00:18:58,136 --> 00:18:59,369
And I should
probably thank you

534
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:00,537
for introducing me to Linda.

535
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:02,906
I think we had
a deep emotional connection

536
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,774
that is very worth
exploring.

537
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,275
So I'm gonna
ask her out again...

538
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:07,744
When she's
emotionally ready.

539
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:09,212
- Hmm.
- Hey, Ron...

540
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,948
Great red shirt.

541
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:15,118
Dude, Ron... you have to tell
him what happened.

542
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,953
Why?
It's none of his business.

543
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:19,288
Because he's been
super sad lately.

544
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:21,690
It kind of seems like you should
at least give him a heads-up

545
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:23,058
so he doesn't get
rejected again.

546
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,428
I like to not get involved
in these matters

547
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:28,030
or any matters
of any nature.

548
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:29,832
Uh, you know, Ron,
someone once told me

549
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:33,301
that this is not how grown-ups
deal with tough situations.

550
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:35,703
We face them head-on.

551
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:39,475
Fine.

552
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:42,477
Oh, my God, Ron...

553
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:44,946
It was you
who told me that.

554
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:47,048
That's crazy.

555
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:49,716
There's that shirt.

556
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:51,318
Look, Chris...

557
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,287
After the bar last night,

558
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:55,556
I...

559
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:59,527
engaged in consensual activities
with Linda.

560
00:20:01,095 --> 00:20:03,130
- I see.
- I didn't plan it.

561
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:05,165
But it occurred.

562
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:06,599
Now you know.

563
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,070
Well, thank you for being
forthright and telling me.

564
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:13,506
You're a good man, Ron.

565
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:19,979
I'm quite lonely.

566
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:21,846
Ah, [Bleep].

567
00:20:22,414 --> 00:20:23,915
They say
to win an election,

568
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,585
you have to be good,
and you have to be lucky.

569
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:30,155
I got pretty damn lucky
when I met Ben.

570
00:20:30,223 --> 00:20:32,291
And I'm lucky
that Ann and Tom

571
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:35,160
and all my other friends
volunteer to help me out.

572
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:37,328
And I'm super lucky that
that tape disappeared.

573
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:45,136
I think we may have used up
all our luck tonight.

574
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:48,339
Actually, not all of it.

575
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,541
He's about to get lucky.

576
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:51,875
It's... it's on.

577
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:53,743
He doesn't even know it yet.

578

00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:03,301
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetheart.

580
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:04,869
I'm not sure
you're even aware of this,

581
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:08,172
but we have now gone 48 hours
without breaking up,

582
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,373
shattering
our previous record.

583
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:10,941
That's not bad.

584
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,677
- To celebrate...
- Oh, please, don't.

585
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:14,445
Whatever this is,
I don't want it.

586
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:17,248
Just a little
48-hour anniversary gift.

587
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:23,353
- Condoms.
- 48 of 'em.

588
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,622
Different flavor
for each hour.

589
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:27,423
Yeah, we're not dating
any more, okay? Get out.

590
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:28,791
- No, wait. - Get out.
- Don't punish me.

591
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,226
- I took a risk.
- Yeah. Bye.
