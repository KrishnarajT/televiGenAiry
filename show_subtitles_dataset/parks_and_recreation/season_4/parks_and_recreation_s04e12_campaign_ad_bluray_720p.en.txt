1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:01,853
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:01,854 --> 00:00:04,426
the next city councilor
for the great city of Pawnee

3
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:06,058
Bobby Newport.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,811
Hey.

5
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:11,178
Thanks, guy.

6
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:14,849
Hey, all right.

7
00:00:14,883 --> 00:00:16,084
Hi, I'm Bobby Newport.

8
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:17,785
You know, we're two days
into this campaign,

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,554
and so far it's going great.

10
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:22,323
In fact, I don't know why
they call it a "cam-pain."

11
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:25,192
Because up until now
it's been a "cam-pleasure."

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,628
All right, hey, why don't
we line up for autographs

13
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:29,263
and free Bobby bars.

14
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:31,499
Huh?
Who wants a Bobby bar?

15
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:34,385
Bobby Newport, heir to
the sweetums candy fortune.

16
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:35,686
My dad made 'em.

17
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:37,004
He just entered the race,

18
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:39,640
and he's already
70 points up in all the polls.

19
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:42,226
He is attractive
and charming.

20
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:44,011
And his family employs
half the town,

21
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:45,029
but so what?

22
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:47,115
I am a lifelong
government bureaucrat

23
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,733
who's well-versed
in the issues.

24
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:51,419
And those are the kind
of sexy qualifications

25
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,421
that win elections.

26
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:54,922
How's it going?
I'm Bobby Newport.

27
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:56,324
But you probably
knew that already.

28
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:58,042
Well, Mr. Newport,
we meet at last.

29
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,243
I'm Leslie Knope.

30
00:00:59,294 --> 00:01:00,694
Ah, okeydoke.

31
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:03,030
So do you want me to sign that
to miss lope or just Nesney?

32
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,032
What? No.

33
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,085
Leslie's fine.
Leslie?

34
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:09,537
Yeah, miss Knope is
a candidate for city council.

35
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,839
Been calling your office
trying to set up a debate.

36
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:13,074
Oh, no,
you guys are wrong.

37
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:14,425
I'm running unopposed.

38
00:01:14,476 --> 00:01:17,011
I'm pretty sure
I'm running unopposed, right?

39
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,347
No, you're not running
unopposed.

40
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,048
You've very opposed by me.

41
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:22,116
Oh, terrific.

42
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:24,652
I love meeting people.
I love it, yeah.

43
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:26,621
What do you guys do?

44
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:28,189
We just told you.

45
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:29,757
We're gonna be running
for city council.

46
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:31,025
Great.
Here, have a Bobby bar.

47
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:32,427
Go ahead,
my dad made 'em.

48
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,727
Okay, folks.

49
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,229
Hey, I'm Bobby Newport.

50
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,447
I think we scared him.

51
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:37,782
Here, have a Bobby bar.
My dad made 'em.

52
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:42,436
♪

53
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,054
Hey, Ann,
are you still a nurse

54
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:02,140
or did they fire you because
you slept with all the doctors?

55
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,624
You wanna try that again?

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,394
Hey, Ann,
are you still a nurse?

57
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:08,596
Because Andy's not
feeling well.

58
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:09,597
What's wrong, Andy?

59
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,764
Just got a headache.

60
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:11,966
And I'm seeing double.

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,301
And I got a song
stuck in my head,

62
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:14,318
and my teeth hurt.

63
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:16,971
Also I'm hungry.

64
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:18,539
Okay, well, some of
those things are symptoms

65
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:20,708
and some of them
are just being a person.

66
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:23,344
Did you hit your head?
No.

67
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:27,965
Oh, yes, technically
I did smash my head area

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,634
into the wall area.

69
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:32,253
Yeah, he was hanging up
his gold record.

70
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:35,923
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

71
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,925
Yeah, I'm good.

72
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:42,796
Point is,
I have a gold record.

73
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,232
Well, I can help you
with cuts and bruises

74
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:46,200
but the other stuff you're gonna
have to see a real doctor.

75
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:47,801
Hey, smart ass,
we can't afford it.

76
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,270
Hey, smart ass,
yes, you can.

77
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:50,638
You have insurance.

78
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:52,490
Neither of your asses
are that smart

79
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:56,511
because insurance is for
if something bad happens

80
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:57,612
to your car.

81
00:02:57,646 --> 00:03:00,281
P.S. I haven't had it
in years.

82
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:02,316
Oh, my God,
we used to live together.

83
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,519
Yeah, you still
got it for me.

84
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:06,187
I'm Bobby Newport.

85
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,857
My family owns nine square
Miles of land in this town.

86
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:13,027
And isn't my family what this
town's really about?

87
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,362
Vote Bobby Newport
for city council.

88
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:16,347
That guy is everywhere.

89
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:17,682
I am not complaining.

90
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:19,333
Well, we have to find
a way to beat him.

91
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:22,220
And luckily Ben
is going to announce

92
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,723
the most amazing campaign
strategy ever thought of

93
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:28,175
in the entire history
of western democracy.

94
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:29,727
Go, Ben,
here's your great idea.

95
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,395
We're all ready for it.
And start.

96
00:03:31,446 --> 00:03:34,148
I'm running for office.
I'm surrounded by my friends.

97
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:36,717
My campaign manager and I
are in love.

98
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:38,920
This is exactly
how I dreamed it would be

99
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:40,154
when I was a kid.

100
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:42,523
Except I wasn't
70 points behind

101
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:45,326
and my campaign manager
was Mr. belvedere.

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,295
We are David.

103
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,915
Newport is goliath.

104
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,866
This is our slingshot.

105
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:55,836
- Yes, we'll write
an inspiring op-ed piece.

106
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,923
- No, the Pawnee-eagleton
high school basketball game.

107
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:02,109
Now, in this town it's bigger
than the super bowl.

108
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:04,679
We take all our money, we air
a TV ad right at halftime.

109
00:04:04,713 --> 00:04:07,748
And I think we should make
an attack ad

110
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:09,734
against Bobby Newport.

111
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:11,402
- Oh!
- That is a great idea!

112
00:04:11,436 --> 00:04:13,271
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

113
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:14,772
- Yay, it's a good idea.
- All right, great.

114
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,023
So let's get to work.

115
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:20,244
Ron Swanson.
How are you?

116
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,596
Present.

117
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,281
I have a meeting
at public works,

118
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:25,533
and I was thinking that maybe
you might wanna sit in.

119
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,234
Why would you think that?

120
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,736
They are working on
a number of fascinating,

121
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:29,754
big-budget projects...

122
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:31,289
I'm very busy here.

123
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,909
That I am being forced
to brutally cut entirely.

124
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,877
I can make room
in my schedule.

125
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,279
Wonderful.

126
00:04:38,313 --> 00:04:40,615
As you know, I'm not a big fan
of delivering bad news.

127
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:42,800
Chris, it would be
my absolute pleasure.

128
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,886
Have you considered cutting
the entire fire department?

129
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,472
I've personally put out
several local fires

130
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,658
at no cost
to the taxpayer.

131
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:52,526
Look to the left.

132
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:55,479
The right.
Whatever.

133
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,697
Are you
the kind of doctor

134
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:57,999
who gets hooked
on his own drugs?

135
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,066
I bet you are.

136
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,267
So, Andy,
tell me what happened.

137
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:02,620
I was reading
an encyclopedia,

138
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:05,539
and I tripped
or "fell over"

139
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:06,907
and hit my head

140
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:08,993
or brain helmet.

141
00:05:09,044 --> 00:05:12,346
Yeah, he sneezed and smacked
his head against the wall.

142
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,964
That sounds about right.

143
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,250
Well, if it's a concussion
it's extremely mild,

144
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,685
so I wouldn't worry about it.

145
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:19,120
Anything else bothering you?

146
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:21,121
- Nope.
- Okay.

147
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,757
Well, I mean, yeah,
I've got a weird rash

148
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,326
in my knee pit area.

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,094
And my tongue,
on this side,

150
00:05:27,128 --> 00:05:28,929
doesn't taste
anything anymore.

151
00:05:28,964 --> 00:05:30,815
Sometimes when I walk
my ankles make, like,

152
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:32,850
a weird rattlesnake sound.

153
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:33,984
What else?

154
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,654
Things that are far away
from my eyes are fuzzy.

155
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:39,156
I once at a twix
with the wrapper on it,

156
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:41,342
and I've never seen
the wrapper come out.

157
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:42,777
Also I've swallowed
every piece of gum

158
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:44,445
that I've chewed
for the past 25 years.

159
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,863
- Andy!
- I don't know.

160
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:47,698
I broke my thumb
on the way over here.

161
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:49,983
Just fix me.

162
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,819
Well, I can help you
with the thumb.

163
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:54,505
And I'll have to give you
referrals for specialists

164
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,457
for the other thousand things.

165
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,793
Wow, thanks for nothing,
Dr. Harris.

166
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:00,294
You're welcome.

167
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,847
Hey, I'm Bobby Newport.
I'm a regular guy.

168
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,665
I like dogs.

169
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:07,068
I'm here with my persian
greyhound raclette,

170
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:08,736
who was given to me
by my buddy,

171
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,639
the pretender to the crown
of alsace-Lorraine.

172
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:12,807
Vote Bobby Newport
for city council.

173
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:14,341
Hey, um,
between you and me,

174
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,211
I think that Donna is having
a problem with going negative

175
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,813
in the ad.

176
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:20,347
- Nah-uh,
I always go negative.

177
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:22,550
Even if I like the guy
I go negative.

178
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:23,984
Keeps 'em interested.

179
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,236
Thanks, Donna.

180
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:26,871
Well, I didn't want
to tell you this,

181
00:06:26,905 --> 00:06:29,156
but Ann is having
a hard time with it.

182
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,191
She's kind of freaking out
right now.

183
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,409
Oh, my God,
this magic marker

184
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,561
smells like cherries.

185
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,563
Hey, here's a question,

186
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:37,565
do you like the idea?

187
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,501
It's... who...

188
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:42,219
Do you like it?

189
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:44,371
Look, you have a vision
of how your campaign should go.

190
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:45,740
I am your chief strategist,

191
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:47,141
so I'm sure
we can work it out.

192
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:48,909
Why don't you just tell me
what you're thinking.

193
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,111
I hate negative ads,

194
00:06:50,145 --> 00:06:51,746
and I would never do one
in a million years.

195
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:55,182
Thank you, John,
for coming in.

196
00:06:55,217 --> 00:06:57,384
The public works department
is wonderful,

197
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,223
and you are the best idea man
in the business.

198
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:04,859
We're cancelling all of
your ongoing projects.

199
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:05,926
What?

200
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:07,762
What about
the Pawnee river dam?

201
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:10,030
Dam's dead.
Have a nice day.

202
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:12,133
Where will
all the water go?

203
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,285
Wherever it's headed now.

204
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:16,771
The important thing is the dam
is never happening

205
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:20,007
and your dream
has been crushed.

206
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,409
- We're very sorry.
- I am not.

207
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:25,079
Good meeting.

208
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:27,414
It's not a negative ad.

209
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:28,966
We're stating facts about him,

210
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,251
and, yeah,
they happen to be negative

211
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:31,752
because he's a bonehead.

212
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:33,053
Well, I wanted
to run an ad

213
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:34,789
that highlights
the good things about me,

214
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:36,557
not the bad things
about somebody else.

215
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:39,092
Tom, you are our
communications director.

216
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,061
Weigh in here.

217
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:43,147
Leslie,
I love your idea.

218
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:46,317
I also love your idea.

219
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:49,487
Two great ideas,
two great people.

220
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:50,988
I don't know
which idea's better,

221
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,074
but I do know I'll end up
on the winning side.

222
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:55,376
When I bet on horses,

223
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,577
I never lose.

224
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,878
Why?

225
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:00,614
I bet on all the horses.

226
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,483
How 'bout we do this,
we split up into teams,

227
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:04,835
we each make a demo version
of our ad.

228
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:07,120
Whichever one we like better
we use.

229
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,839
Great idea!

230
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,341
As long as Leslie
thinks so as well.

231
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:12,960
Sure, I'll pick Ann
and Donna for my team.

232
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:14,795
You can take Jerry.
What?

233
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,463
Well, you wanted
to go negative.

234
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:19,149
You got the biggest negative
in the world, buddy.

235
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:22,736
Okay everybody

236
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:23,937
I need big smiles from you

237
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,539
We're making
a positive ad here.

238
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:28,609
So just think of this
as Christmas and your birthday

239
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,477
and the first day of school
all rolled up into one.

240
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:32,696
Positive is always
better than negative.

241
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:34,281
Barack Obama said,
"yes we can,"

242
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:35,532
and now he's president.

243
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,850
Ben says,
"no we shouldn't,"

244
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,119
and now he's working
for his girlfriend.

245
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:40,704
Guys, I need
double the smiles, okay?

246
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:43,540
Let's take it back again.
And action.

247
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:46,377
And this is going great.
We're really positive.

248
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:48,962
I think we're getting
good stuff, right?

249
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,832
What's it?

250
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,334
Oh, come on.

251
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,220
Leslie, I think Bobby
Newport's bus was in that shot.

252
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:57,221
Do you think?

253
00:08:57,272 --> 00:09:01,375
E, h, 4, m.

254
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,027
Potato shape.

255
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,212
Coffee mug shape.

256
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,731
Smudge, smudge,
middle finger, smudge.

257
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:09,400
The rest are all smudges.

258
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:11,285
Oh, my God,
you drove us here.

259
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:13,487
We made, like, 100 million
doctors' appointments

260
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:15,021
for ourselves in one week.

261
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,041
After this we won't
have to go to the doctor

262
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:18,659
for, like, ten years,

263
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:21,545
because we're smart.

264
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,163
Well, you definitely
need glasses.

265
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:24,431
No, he's not
getting glasses.

266
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:25,766
I like his face
the way it is.

267
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,301
If you get glasses,
I'll divorce you.

268
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:28,836
Well, you heard her, doc.

269
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,555
Too handsome for glasses,
no offense.

270
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,541
I gotta admit,
his hair game's on point.

271
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,876
Gotta find out
what kind of product

272
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,378
he puts up in his "herr."

273
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,430
Hey, how's
Leslie's ad going?

274
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,614
It's very good.

275
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:44,284
But yours is also very good.

276
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:45,569
- You ready for
the voice-over?

277
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:46,720
Yeah.

278
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:50,824
Bobby Newport's never
had a real job

279
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,726
in his life.

280
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:53,894
You gotta give it
more attitude.

281
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:55,562
It's gotta scare people.

282
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:57,197
Bobby Newport...

283
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:59,967
Yeah, okay.
All right.

284
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,586
Bobby Newport's never had

285
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,873
a real job in his life.

286
00:10:05,907 --> 00:10:07,875
- Bobby Newport's never had

287
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,943
a real job in his life.

288
00:10:09,978 --> 00:10:11,545
Bobby Newport.

289
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,746
Bobby Newport.

290
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,348
Bobby Newport.

291
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:15,883
Bobby Newport.

292
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,751
Bobby Newport.

293
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:18,752
Bobby Newport.

294
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:20,954
- Bobby.
- Bobby.

295
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:21,939
Bobby.

296
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:23,273
Newport.

297
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:25,943
All right, now we're just
wasting time, Jerry.

298
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:27,478
Ron Swanson!

299
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:29,797
I want to thank you for being
so ruthless and cruel

300
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:30,948
in the meeting
the other day.

301
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:32,766
You'll have to be
more specific.

302
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:34,668
With the public works
department about the dam.

303
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:35,769
Ah.

304
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:36,987
What do you say
I take you to lunch

305
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:38,405
and then we can talk
about all the projects

306
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:39,573
that you want
to get accomplished.

307
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:40,874
That won't be necessary.

308
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,242
I don't have any projects.

309
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:43,577
I hate projects.

310
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:50,617
What a pill.
We should order.

311
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:52,820
And then we can talk shop.
What are you gonna have?

312
00:10:52,854 --> 00:10:57,641
I'm thinking something
raw and cucumber-based.

313
00:10:57,675 --> 00:10:58,675
A cucumber.

314
00:10:58,726 --> 00:10:59,927
I don't know what happened.

315
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:01,728
I declined
his invitation.

316
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:03,130
He started laughing.

317
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:06,200
And the next thing I knew,
we were at lunch.

318
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:08,152
Did he drug me?

319
00:11:08,186 --> 00:11:09,670
Hi, I'm Bobby Newport.

320
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:12,806
My dad is friends
with John cougar mellencamp.

321
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,308
That's pretty cool.

322
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,609
What is this guy
running for,

323
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:17,494
president of being on every
channel all the time?

324
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,363
Reminder, Leslie,
we have less than an hour

325
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:20,998
to get the ad
to the station.

326
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:22,482
Ann, you're beautiful
and you're organized.

327
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,284
So in order
not to bias anyone,

328
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:26,170
these are the two ads
that Ben and I made.

329
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:27,421
I'm just gonna
pick one randomly,

330
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:28,922
and we'll play
that one first.

331
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,257
Oh, yay,
the awesome one.

332
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:33,460
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope.

333
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:35,679
I'm pro-parks,
pro-public safety,

334
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,347
and I'm pro-clean water.

335
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:39,433
I'm also pro-environmental
regulation,

336
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:42,269
and I'm very,
very pro-local propositions

337
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:44,505
45, 86, and 102f.

338
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:47,307
But most of all,
I'm pro-Pawnee.

339
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,843
Here are some other things
that I'm pro.

340
00:12:01,072 --> 00:12:02,489
As you can see,

341
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,041
I'm in favor
of a lot of things,

342
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:05,375
like hot dogs.

343
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,960
Right, Charlie?

344
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,395
I'm Leslie Knope,

345
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,830
and I approve
this message.

346
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:11,882
Yes.
I love it.

347
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,533
Fantastic.

348
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,435
Do we even want
to screen yours?

349
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,037
Uh, yeah,
that was awful.

350
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,105
What do you mean?

351
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:19,223
Name one thing
that was wrong with it.

352
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:20,874
Okay, you never
even mentioned

353
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,376
you were running
for office.

354
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,512
You literally never said
the words "city council."

355
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:28,181
I did... it's implied.

356
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,050
I didn't... we can just
put it in.

357
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:31,101
Okay.

358
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:34,271
Leslie is so good
at so many things

359
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:36,690
and so bad at that.

360
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:41,945
Bobby Newport's been handed
everything on a silver platter.

361
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:45,032
His cushy job at his dad's
candy company,

362
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,067
handed to him.

363
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:50,037
His 60-foot boat,
Bobby's boat,

364
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:53,874
handed to him
when he was 12.

365
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:55,842
Leslie Knope is running
for city council too,

366
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:58,378
and she's earned everything
she's ever gotten.

367
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,913
She has.

368
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:01,848
Bobby Newport wants you
to just hand him

369
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,416
this election.

370
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:04,418
Don't.

371
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:05,919
I won't.

372
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,104
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

373
00:13:07,138 --> 00:13:08,105
I love it.

374
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:10,290
Now, people,
this is an ad.

375
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:12,926
It's succinct, it's punchy.
It's mean.

376
00:13:12,944 --> 00:13:15,479
It's depressing.
It's awful.

377
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,799
"I am Ben Wyatt, and I want
to destroy Leslie's dreams."

378
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:21,768
Okay, if you're allergic
to any food,

379
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,203
we'll know
in a few days.

380
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,621
I think
based on the redness

381
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:27,407
I might be allergic
to getting stabbed by needles.

382
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,959
We have already been to, like,
five different doctors.

383
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:31,712
I got my ankles microwaved.
- X-rayed.

384
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:33,547
They took my blood away
to use for science.

385
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:34,615
Cholesterol tests.

386
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,117
April had
her sinuses removed?

387
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,302
Looked at.

388
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:40,053
Some guy looked
at my wiener, touched it.

389
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:41,171
That was weird.

390
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:42,756
And that guy
wasn't even a doctor.

391
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,975
That...

392
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,292
What?

393
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:48,095
Now I think it is time
for us to take a vote.

394
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,130
So who's in favor
of Ben's ad?

395
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,832
Traitors!

396
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:54,334
Ann, I painted
your garage pink.

397
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,069
I did not ask you
to do that.

398
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:58,271
Leslie, look,
I want you to win,

399
00:13:58,306 --> 00:13:59,940
and Ben's ad
is just better.

400
00:13:59,974 --> 00:14:01,608
Our friendship is over.
No, it's not.

401
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,327
It's not over.
It's never over.

402
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:04,811
Bff.
I love you forever.

403
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:06,330
You know what, it seems like
we're kind of evenly split.

404
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:07,531
I think we should
keep debating.

405
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:09,533
We're not split.
It's unanimous.

406
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,518
- We air my ad.
- But I...

407
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:14,004
This is just... it's just not
the way I dreamed it would be.

408
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:16,523
This is
the right call, okay?

409
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:17,758
I promise.

410
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,292
Okay.

411
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:21,327
I'm going to air
a negative ad.

412
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:23,030
It's out of my hands now.

413
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:25,198
But you know what,
I'm actually feeling

414
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:28,168
very zen about this.

415
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,003
- Are you are Ben Wyatt?
- Yeah.

416
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:31,638
Okay, I need that DVD
in the control room.

417
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,874
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.

418
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:37,010
I am Leslie Knope, and
I do not approve this message.

419
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:39,780
What are you doing?
What are you...

420
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:40,814
Ah.

421
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,390
Alright, the good news is,

422
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:46,858
there's only two pieces
of bad news.

423
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:48,977
The bad news is,
none of our ads aired

424
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:50,712
and we cannot get
our money back.

425
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:51,880
Oh, God.

426
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:53,147
There was probably
a better way

427
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,649
for you to tell us that.

428
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:55,817
You both really blew this.

429
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:58,286
But I can't wait to hear
your new ideas.

430
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,571
I love 'em already.

431
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:00,989
Ooh, I'm hungry.

432
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:04,559
Tommy needs a mango.
See ya.

433
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,761
I'm really sorry
I tackled you.

434
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:09,797
It's just, I'd rather run
the fake campaign ads

435
00:15:09,832 --> 00:15:11,299
that I made
when I was ten

436
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,001
than become negative
and cynical.

437
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:17,071
Look, I really don't wanna
crush your childhood dreams,

438
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,573
but I bet in your dreams

439
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:21,376
you weren't losing an election
by 70 points.

440
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,278
You need to get tougher,
Leslie.

441
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:25,346
You just have to.

442
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,382
You need to get tougher.

443
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:30,518
You were pretty easy
to take down.

444
00:15:30,552 --> 00:15:31,586
Thanks.

445
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,072
Ron Swanson!

446
00:15:34,106 --> 00:15:35,723
Just the man
I wanted to see.

447
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,276
I'm going to be going
to a seminar

448
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:41,079
on the art of
the japanese tea ceremony...

449
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:43,531
Or chakat the Pawnee
community college,

450
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:45,033
and I thought you might like
to come with me.

451
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:46,868
Why?

452
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:48,469
I know how much
you value silence.

453
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:50,371
A fair point.

454
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:52,307
But we did just
have lunch last week,

455
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:54,642
so I feel like we've spent
enough social time together

456
00:15:54,677 --> 00:15:57,745
for the foreseeable... Ever.

457
00:15:57,763 --> 00:15:59,080
All right, well,
if you change your mind,

458
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:00,465
you know where to find me.

459
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,917
Donna Meagle!
Chris Traeger!

460
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:05,270
For some godforsaken reason
that man is suddenly determined

461
00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:06,921
to hang on with me.

462
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:08,423
You mean hang out?

463
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,091
What is wrong with him?

464
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:11,326
I don't know, he's got you
doing Ben's job,

465
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,860
eating lunch with him
like Ben used to.

466
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:15,396
Maybe he just misses
his little buddy.

467
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,466
Ow.

468
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,535
Let's get you home
and get me some ice cream.

469
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:21,669
Here's your bill.

470
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:23,488
Whoa, yeah,
won't be needing that.

471
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:25,139
I've got
the free medicine card.

472
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:28,309
Uh, there's a $500 deductible
for dental procedures.

473
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:29,877
Oh, I think you're wrong.

474
00:16:29,912 --> 00:16:32,447
We have the insurance thing.

475
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:34,515
I believe we're covered.
It's still $500.

476
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,584
Let's see here.

477
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:39,487
Oh, because,
you know what...

478
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,673
Let's go!
Dine and dash.

479
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:43,808
Out of the way!

480
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:46,160
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

481
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:47,395
Ah!

482
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,180
Ah, call an ambulance!

483
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:52,467
A different ambulance than
the one I ran into.

484
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:55,870
This is city council
candidate Leslie Knope

485
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,972
when she was ten years old.

486
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,807
Hi, I'm Leslie Knope.

487
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:01,109
I love Pawnee.

488
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:03,111
And I want to make it
even better.

489
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:05,213
Better schools,
safer streets,

490
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:08,116
and a more progressive tax
on residential properties.

491
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,353
This is city council
candidate Bobby Newport today.

492
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:13,755
People keep asking me:

493
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:15,857
Bobby, what are you gonna do
once you get into office?

494
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:19,427
Um, I'm pretty sure
I'll figure it out.

495
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,714
Leslie Knope had better
ideas when she was ten

496
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:25,133
than Bobby Newport has now.

497
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:26,534
They do have
one thing in common.

498
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:28,502
Both: I like dogs.

499
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,371
For a better Pawnee,

500
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,006
vote Knope for city council.

501
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:34,308
Well, we already have
a thousand views.

502
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:36,444
Yeah, but no calls
from reporters,

503
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:37,695
no interview requests.

504
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,814
I don't care.
I'm proud of it.

505
00:17:39,848 --> 00:17:41,482
You sure?

506
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,584
It is accurate about
my opponent, it does not take...

507
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,519
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold that thought.

508
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:48,022
Ron Swanson!
What a pleasant surprise.

509
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,190
And who's this?

510
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:51,926
This is a great friend
of mine.

511
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,562
He is a fellow
who works in the building

512
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:57,832
and he is named Dennis.
Kyle.

513
00:17:57,866 --> 00:18:01,035
He strongly enjoys
japanese culture,

514
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,804
and I thought he might
wanna go with you

515
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,605
to the thing.

516
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,773
- The tea ceremony.
- Yes.

517
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,091
You're a brother
japanophile?

518
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:10,478
I was eating rice,
and Ron made me come up here.

519
00:18:10,512 --> 00:18:12,413
But sure,
that sounds fun.

520
00:18:12,448 --> 00:18:13,398
Arigato.

521
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:16,484
Ron, a moment.

522
00:18:16,518 --> 00:18:19,454
All right, pal, level with me.
What's going on?

523
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:22,857
Well, you seemed like
you wanted a friend.

524
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:25,326
No, no, no, no.

525
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,328
I'm not lonely.
I have me.

526
00:18:27,362 --> 00:18:29,897
And 4,000 Facebook friends
and a hot girlfriend.

527
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:32,066
I wanted to spend time
with you,

528
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:34,535
because I have to replace Ben
as assistant city manager

529
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,704
and I was giving you
a tryout of sorts.

530
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:40,074
Now, I'll mull my options
for the next few months,

531
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:41,709
but I'd love you
to keep an open mind.

532
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:44,746
Kyle-San!
Arigato!

533
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,930
Mr. Newport, hello.

534
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,081
Hi.

535
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,250
Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt.

536
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:50,351
- Yeah, hi.
- Good to see you.

537
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,853
Nice to see you.
You guys want anything?

538
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:54,105
This is a restaurant,
so they have food and stuff.

539
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:55,356
- I'll take a milkshake.
- We're good.

540
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,525
No, we're good.
What can we do for you?

541
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:02,263
Yes, um, why'd you guys
post that video of me, man?

542
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:04,332
I mean, that didn't
make me feel good.

543
00:19:04,366 --> 00:19:07,635
It was... it was mean.
You guys are mean.

544
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,071
Well, we used your own ad,

545
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:12,273
so I don't think
it was mean.

546
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,841
All right, let me
lay it out for you.

547
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:16,043
My friends keep sending me
links to that video

548
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:17,779
and they just
make fun of me.

549
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:20,281
So just stop running, okay?

550
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:22,300
Just... that... stop.

551
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:23,334
Stop running the ad?

552
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:24,819
No, stop running
the campaign.

553
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,521
What?

554
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:27,722
Just quit.

555
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:29,690
It would be so cool of you
if you just quit.

556
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:31,759
Then I can win the election,

557
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:32,960
and I'll have a big party,

558
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,495
and I'll put you both
on the guest list,

559
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,813
plus one.

560
00:19:35,848 --> 00:19:37,348
I'm gonna have a man
who does magic.

561
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,733
He's really good.

562
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:41,135
Not, like, cheesy magic.
Like, good magic.

563
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:44,372
We're not gonna quit
the campaign.

564
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:45,773
Why would we do that?

565
00:19:45,808 --> 00:19:48,943
Because I want it.

566
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,011
Come on, give me it.

567
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:51,813
Give me it.
Give me it.

568
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:53,147
Come on, give me it.

569
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:54,382
Just give me the election.

570
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,867
I'm sorry, please.

571
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,335
Please.

572
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:59,887
Well, Leslie, he does make
a compelling argument.

573
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:03,558
Come on, ugh!
Come on, guy.

574
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:05,326
- Bobby.
- Ah, it's not padded!

575
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:06,494
Can I ask you a question?

576
00:20:06,528 --> 00:20:08,379
Why are you even
running for office?

577
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,897
You know what,
I need something to do

578
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,365
to get my dad off my back.

579
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,867
This seemed easy.

580
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,368
What about you,
why are you doing it?

581
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:15,837
Who's your dad?

582
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:17,939
I'm running for office because
I want to improve the lives

583
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:19,273
of the people that I love

584
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,675
and the city that's
the greatest city in the world.

585
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,510
What?
What does that even mean?

586
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:23,911
Hey, I've got an idea.

587
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:27,014
How 'bout you quit running,
then I win,

588
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:29,350
but then I let you do
all the work.

589
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:30,651
I'm not going anywhere,

590
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:32,686
and we are gonna debate soon,

591
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:35,623
and I need to warn you,
I know my stuff.

592
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:38,576
So you should toughen up.

593
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:43,030
Why are you guys smiling?
I feel bad.

594
00:20:43,048 --> 00:20:44,081
Hey, quick question.

595
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:45,583
That little girl
from your video.

596
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,084
Oh, my God, she's so cute.

597
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,369
Do you think you can
talk to her

598
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:50,721
and let her do an ad for me?

599
00:20:50,756 --> 00:20:52,373
That girl is me

600
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:54,508
as a ten-year-old.

601
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:56,611
How'd you do that?

602
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:00,381
Maybe you should see
one of the other doctors.

603
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:02,416
No.
No more doctors.

604
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:04,201
They're a bunch
of scam artists.

605
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:05,903
They reel you in
with the free stuff.

606
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:07,889
Next thing you know, bam,

607
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:10,341
you run into an ambulance.

608
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,876
Every time.

609
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:14,095
Let's just go home
and care for each other.

610
00:21:14,146 --> 00:21:15,446
We could buy a sewing kit.

611
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:18,015
You could sew up my lip
underneath a bridge somewhere.

612
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,034
Mmm, so romantic.

613
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:23,070
— Oh, sorry, I forgot.

614
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:24,322
Let's go.
All right.

615
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:26,591
Do you think sewing kits
are covered by insurance?

616
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,392
Or groceries
or, like, Xbox games?

617
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,393
What is insurance?

618
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:31,345
I don't know.
Who cares?

619
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:32,378
