1
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:04,093
- Morning.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:06,329
Hey, can you approve this new
design for the campaign poster?

3
00:00:06,497 --> 00:00:09,231
Oh, Ann, you beautiful,
rule-breaking moth.

4
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:12,034
You know we can't talk
about my campaign in here.

5
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,201
Seriously?

6
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:15,270
It's a "yes" or "no"
question.

7
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:16,772
When you're running
for office,

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,174
there are, like, a million rules
of what you can and cannot do.

9
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:20,409
Yes.

10
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:21,744
And because I work
for the government,

11
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,045
I am not allowed to do
anything campaign-related

12
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:26,014
inside a government building.

13
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:27,582
Boss, I need
your Herbie Hancock on this.

14
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,450
Outside.

15
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,019
It's kind of a pain
in the ass.

16
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:34,422
But it's great exercise...
But it's a pain in the ass.

17
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:36,257
So Perd Hapley
wants to do Thursday now.

18
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:36,891
Fine.

19
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:38,159
Did you finish
the maintenance report?

20
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:39,427
I did not finish it,
but I will finish it.

21
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:40,326
So wait,
what was your question again?

22
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:41,428
The slogan?

23
00:00:41,495 --> 00:00:42,495
Okay,
can I just come out there,

24
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:43,897
so we can talk
about everything?

25
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:46,066
No, April, I need to keep
my work separate, okay?

26
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:48,468
Just think of it
like a fun game.

27
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:50,771
Parks is inside.
Campaign is outside.

28
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,505
Parks is inside.
Campaign's outside.

29
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:53,640
Ooh, you know
what would make it more fun?

30
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,042
- What?
- Oh, my God, this.

31
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,045
April.

It's time, Leslie.

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,835
You have to take a leave
of absence from the department.

36
00:01:23,903 --> 00:01:25,503
Ron,
that is ridiculous.

37
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:27,938
- We've talked about this.
- No, you've talked about it,

38
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:29,506
and I've ignored it,
because it is ridiculous.

39
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:32,743
Need I remind you
that even if I win the election,

40
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,678
I can still work
at the Parks department.

41
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,346
City council
is a part-time job.

42
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:38,682
But campaigning
is a full-time job.

43
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,451
Right now you're working
50 hours a week here

44
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,286
and 50 hours a week
on the campaign.

45
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,721
Well,
I have time to spare.

46
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:48,091
I'm also volunteering
at "Wheels For Meals On Wheels."

47
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,493
We repair vans
for "Meals On Wheels."

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,229
You're a month
behind on everything.

49
00:01:53,296 --> 00:01:55,531
You forgot to file the weekly
Parks Maintenance report.

50
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,734
You do it every week,
and you forgot.

51
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,335
Things are falling
through the cracks.

52
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,004
I'm pretty sure you've worn
that sweater four days in a row.

53
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,673
Or I own four identical
versions of the same sweater.

54
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,675
No, you don't,
there's an old lollipop

55
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:08,209
that's been stuck to the back
since Tuesday.

56
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:13,015
That's the style now, Ron.

57
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:15,117
It's called
"lollipopping."

58
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:16,684
All the kids
are doing it.

59
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:18,119
Leslie, you need
to take a sabbatical.

60
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:19,654
Okay.
You know what, Ron?

61
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:20,988
I accept your apology,

62
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,923
I will not take a sabbatical,
as we agreed,

63
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:25,993
and we will never
discuss this again.

64
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:29,163
Sorry, Ann.
You can't open this gift.

65
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,831
It's for the most beautiful
girl in Pawnee.

66
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,266
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

67
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,005
Hold up, hold up, wait.
That's you.

68
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:40,306
Wow.

69
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:42,408
Yeah, and look,
I got one too.

70
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,910
Matching His and Hers.

71
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,979
So I'm "Tommy's girl,"
and you're just "Tom"?

72
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:47,746
Why not "Ann's man"?

73
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:50,248
Nobody owns me,
cupcake, not even you.

74
00:02:50,316 --> 00:02:52,584
You can either burn
these hats in a fire,

75
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:54,252
or you can use
a blowtorch.

76
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,221
How about this option?

77
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:58,256
- We put the hats on...
- Don't say it.

78
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:00,527
We take
everything else off.

79
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:05,396
These Kangol hats
are exactly like the one

80
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:07,631
Samuel L. Jackson wore
to the Latin Grammys.

81
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,500
- How could she not like them?
- I don't know.

82
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:12,536
It's like somehow everything
I do with her is wrong.

83
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:15,639
Dude, seriously,
leave me out of this.

84
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,941
I kind of set up
Tom and Ann,

85
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:19,177
and now they won't stop
asking me for advice,

86
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:21,344
which is a really bad move
on their part,

87
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:25,281
because I really don't care
what happens to them...

88
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,017
Or anyone.

89
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,386
Champion!
Hey, bud.

90
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:32,122
I missed you.

91
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,656
Thank you so much.
I hope he wasn't a handful.

92
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:35,325
Not in the slightest.

93
00:03:35,392 --> 00:03:39,561
As the Germans would say,
"er ist ein wunder hund."

94
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:41,530
- He is a wonder dog.
- Oh.

95
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:42,598
The dog training course
I took

96
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,933
was conducted entirely
in German,

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,301
and so now
I'm fluent in German...

98
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:47,870
Words relating
to dogs.

99
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:49,504
April and Andy went away
for the night,

100
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,607
and I looked
after Champion here.

101
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:52,907
He's a mutt.

102
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:56,111
Half amazing,
half terrific.

103
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,313
Ich bin ein
three-legged dog.

104
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,815
Well,
I took him to PetSmart.

105
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:02,383
I got him
various toys,

106
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,720
got him shots, got him groomed,
and gave him plenty of exercise.

107
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:06,687
He's healthier
than ever.

108
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,922
Wait,
did his leg grow back?

109
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,258
Aw, no, no.
That's okay.

110
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:12,793
- Andy, if I may...
- Yes.

111
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,694
Dogs tend to take on
the personalities

112
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:16,329
- of their owners...
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,065
So if you were to sit
on your couch all day

114
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,100
watching cartoons
and eating nothing but Cheetos,

115
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:21,135
that's what he would want
to do too.

116
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:22,302
Who wouldn't?

117
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,171
That sounds like
an amazing day, right?

118
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,439
Okay, well, thanks.

119
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:28,408
Bye, Champion.

120
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:30,176
Morning, Leslie.

121
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:32,044
Jerry, take that shirt off.

122
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:33,546
You look ridiculous.

123
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:38,117
Gayle gave me this shirt
yesterday as a birthday present.

124
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:39,852
Oh, my God,
Jerry.

125
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,654
I can't believe
I forgot your birthday.

126
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,088
Leslie,
it is okay.

127
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:45,023
I mean, let's face it,
it's a tough one to remember.

128
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:47,426
My birthday
is February 29th,

129
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:50,329
so I only get one real birthday,
you know, once every four years.

130
00:04:50,397 --> 00:04:52,598
But it's great
because my wife Gayle

131
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,932
makes such a big deal
out of it.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,434
We go,
we split a huge piece

133
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:56,801
of cotton candy cheesecake

134
00:04:56,868 --> 00:04:58,469
from Cakey J's
Cheesecake Facility.

135
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:01,439
And then, well,
we hold hands for a while.

136
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,474
We listen
to some Anita Baker.

137
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:07,178
She meets up with some friends,
and I turn in early.

138
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:09,580
This is unacceptable.
Birthdays are important.

139
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:10,981
I'm so sorry
we forgot yours.

140
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,417
I guess it just slipped
through the cracks.

141
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:15,852
Yes,
I guess it did.

142
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,522
Anyway,
Happy Birthday to Jerry.

143
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:20,657
You are a kind
and wonderful soul.

144
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:22,058
Thank you.

145
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:23,960
Also I need you to do
some fecal contamination testing

146
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:25,762
- at the reservoir.
- Now?

147
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,096
Yes, go get a kit
from maintenance,

148
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:28,564
and I need you to check
the water for bird dung.

149
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:29,965
Can I at least
grab the gloves?

150
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,300
Jerry, what are you doing
standing here?

151
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:34,503
- Our water has poop in it.
- Oh, my God.

152
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,206
Now Jerry is turning 64
this year.

153
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:40,108
- He's only 64?
- 64 divided by 4 is...

154
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:41,577
- 16.
- 64.

155
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,479
So we're gonna throw him
a Sweet 16 surprise party.

156
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,280
It's gonna be very special.

157
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:49,718
- The usual, cake and pop?
- No, April, the unusual.

158
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:51,720
- Fish and pop.
- No.

159
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,521
- Cake and fish.
- No, no fish.

160
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,591
Jerry only gets a real birthday
every four years.

161
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,992
And four years from now,
who knows?

162
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,461
He might be retired...
Or dead.

163
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,829
Let's start a pool.

164
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:02,929
Who wants retied?
Who wants dead?

165
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:03,964
- Dead.
- No.

166
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,599
- I got one dead.
- No.

167
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,369
- You need to take that?
- Mm, no.

168
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:10,904
The campaign can wait, 'cause
this is official Parks business.

169
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:13,306
Donna,
can we use your lake house?

170
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,975
How did you know
about that?

171
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,576
My family has a lake house
up in the foothills,

172
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,478
but we keep it quiet.

173
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,447
We're not big
on hospitality.

174
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,683
The Meagles
are a cold people.

175
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,017
Can we use your house?

176
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,987
I suppose.

177
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,522
Bring your own towels.

178
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,758
Wow, Donna.

179
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,525
This place
is beautiful.

180
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,294
Yes, it is,
and it will stay that way.

181
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,497
These are the house rules.
No dirty shoes in the house.

182
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,366
Upstairs is Meagle space
only.

183
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,537
And if you listen closely, that
is the bubbling of the hot tub.

184
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,406
You do not have access
to it.

185
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:51,642
If you follow these rules,
we won't have a problem.

186
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,111
Oh, my God.

187
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:57,247
- Is that Ginuwine?
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:58,982
Why do you have
Ginuwine's platinum record

189
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,484
on your wall?

190
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:03,854
Why do you have a photo of you
with Ginuwine at some place?

191
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,355
Oh, have I never talked
about this before?

192
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,490
Ginuwine's my cousin.

193
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:09,992
Ginuwine?

194
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,029
The Ginuwine
is your cousin?

195
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:14,497
How do I not know this?

196
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:17,934
Who's Ginuwine?

197
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:21,670
Ginuwine?

198
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:26,041
Ginuwine is Ginuwine.
He's Ginuwine.

199
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:27,876
Saying his name over and over
again is not going to help me.

200
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:29,645
He's an R&B singer.

201
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:31,914
Pony, Differences.

202
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:34,115
Do you really not know
who Ginuwine is?

203
00:07:34,183 --> 00:07:35,818
I know that
he's Donna's cousin.

204
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:38,419
When I'm dating someone,
I have a list

205
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:39,921
called
my "oh-no-nos."

206
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:42,924
A woman commits an "oh-no-no,"
it can end the relationship.

207
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:45,893
Not loving '90s R&B music

208
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:50,130
is number three
on the "oh-no-nos" list.

209
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:52,066
Girl doesn't even know
who Ginuwine is.

210
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,400
Hey, boy.
How was the ride?

211
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,635
Oh, hey, you want me
to show you something?

212
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:57,403
Okay.

213
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,508
Platz.

214
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,208
Steh Auf.

215
00:08:02,276 --> 00:08:05,345
See, it's pretty cool, huh?
Would you like me to teach you?

216
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:08,114
Uh, whatever.
I mean, anybody can do that.

217
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:16,689
Toxic.
Merkel.

218
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:18,156
- Merkel.
- What is "Merkel"?

219
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:20,726
She's the Chancellor
of Germany.

220
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:23,395
Not only more jobs
but better jobs.

221
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:26,865
I just did a phone interview
while simultaneously

222
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:29,434
decorating this house
for Jerry's surprise party.

223
00:08:29,502 --> 00:08:33,005
Totally multitasking,
totally on top of all of it.

224
00:08:33,072 --> 00:08:36,174
Crow for dinner tonight,
Mr. Swanson?

225
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:38,410
Okay,
we are locked and loaded.

226
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,278
Music is ready.
Slideshow is prepped.

227
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:42,880
- April, when does Jerry arrive?
- How would I know?

228
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:44,715
Who was supposed
to invite Jerry?

229
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,784
Guys, someone was supposed
to invite Jerry.

230
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:50,121
It's his surp...

231
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:53,690
Crap, it was me.
I forgot to invite Jerry.

232
00:08:58,063 --> 00:08:59,532
You need to take
a sabbatical.

233
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,166
I'm not taking
a sabbatical.

234
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:02,668
Is this because I forgot
to invite Jerry

235
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:05,338
- to his own birthday party?
- It did seem like an oversight.

236
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:07,273
I have a prediction, Ron.
By the end of the night,

237
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:09,241
you are going to take
a bite of Jerry's cake,

238
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:12,144
which incidentally, we need
to pick up on the way home,

239
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:15,780
and you are gonna say,
"sabbatical, schmabbatical.

240
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,550
Leslie can do it all.
She's the best, and I'm stupid."

241
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,153
That does sound
like me.

242
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,189
Hey.
Here's a fun game.

243
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:28,592
Let's talk minimum acceptable
thread count for sheets.

244
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,428
- Ooh, that does sound fun.
- Stop me when I hit it.

245
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:33,964
1,000...

246
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,399
800...

247
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:38,602
700...

248
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,004
600?

249
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:43,139
Ann, I'm at 600.
Are you really not stopping me?

250
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:44,807
I have
those cotton t-shirt sheets.

251
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,942
Huh?

252
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,678
It's always
the most beautiful ladies

253
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:51,347
who hurt you the worst.

254
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:53,750
She's never seen
a single Paul Walker movie?

255
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,217
That's a huge "oh-no-no."

256
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:58,353
She also "doesn't care"
about Blu-ray?

257
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,722
- She's a monster.
- April, this is serious.

258
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,491
I might have to break up
with Ann.

259
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:04,393
Yeah, well,
then break up with her.

260
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,060
But she's my dream girl.

261
00:10:06,128 --> 00:10:07,296
Then don't break up
with her.

262
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:08,664
Except she hates
everything I like.

263
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:11,232
I own more pairs of Uggs
than she does.

264
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,734
I was getting kind of sick
of listening

265
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,069
to Tom and Ann talk
about their relationship,

266
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:19,109
but then I remembered
that alcohol existed.

267
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:24,845
Thank you, alcohol.

268
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:28,382
Jerry?
Jerry.

269
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,249
Where the hell could he be?

270
00:10:30,318 --> 00:10:31,984
Maybe someone else
had a surprise party

271
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:33,320
and actually remembered
to invite him.

272
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:37,223
Jerry?

273
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,025
Jerry.

274
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:40,460
Jerry?

275
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:43,496
Jerry!
Come on in.

276
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:45,597
- Oh, God.
- Leslie.

277
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:47,333
Hello, Jerry.

278
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,735
Jerry,
why did you call us in here?

279
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:51,437
Well, because I thought
you were Gayle.

280
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:52,904
What are you doing
in my bathroom?

281
00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:55,874
Yes, Leslie, what are we
doing in Jerry's bathroom?

282
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:58,009
There is
a Parks emergency

283
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,245
that only you
can help us solve,

284
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:01,779
so we need you
to get out of the tub.

285
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,013
Let's get going.

286
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:05,650
O-okay, jes... w...
I gotta get dressed.

287
00:11:05,718 --> 00:11:07,618
- No, there's no time.
- There's time, Jerry.

288
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,053
Get dressed.

289
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,021
Okay, well,
what is the big emergency?

290
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:13,725
Oh, did we lose more seniors
in the woods?

291
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:14,859
No, it's a sinkhole,
right?

292
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:16,927
Crap on a catapult.

293
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:19,529
They screwed up
my campaign signs.

294
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:20,664
Now I gotta deal
with this.

295
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:22,198
Okay,
but what about the sinkhole?

296
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,068
Don't worry, Leslie will deal
with this and the sinkhole.

297
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,537
Right, Leslie?

298
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,573
Yes, Ron.
I will, Ron.

299
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,242
And I shall do it
with aplomb.

300
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,377
What the hell
is wrong with Tom?

301
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,511
Don't know.

302
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,214
It's like I'm dating
some idiotic game show host.

303
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:41,351
He is driving me crazy
with these stupid questions.

304
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:42,451
Well, soon it won't matter.

305
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,854
Why?
What did he tell you?

306
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:46,089
Nothing.

307
00:11:46,656 --> 00:11:48,925
Wait, is he gonna
break up with me?

308
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,926
I don't know.
I'm...

309
00:11:50,994 --> 00:11:53,295
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No.

310
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:54,629
That's not how this ends,
okay?

311
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:57,332
I break up with him.

312
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,136
I think I will celebrate
with a drink.

313
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:03,538
Quit pulling.

314
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,507
Fine, I'll let you
off the leash.

315
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:07,909
- Andy.
- What the [Bleep], dude?

316
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,277
Where did you come from?

317
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,878
I think that Champion
should stay on his leash.

318
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:13,547
There's unfamiliar terrain
and strange smells.

319
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:15,416
No, leashes are just
for dogs that bite people.

320
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:16,850
That's not true.

321
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,720
Chris,
Champion's my dog, okay?

322
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:21,155
He's not going anywhere.

323
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,990
Sometimes you just have
to let a dog be a dog.

324
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:26,026
He'll be all right.

325
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:29,063
Champion!

326
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:32,698
He'll come back.

327
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:35,001
So as you can imagine,
we would never have ordered

328
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:37,370
a sign with all
this complicated nonsense

329
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:39,604
because, you know,
we're not insane.

330
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:41,540
See right here
on the order form?

331
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:44,143
- It says, "http://..."
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,845
- "www. knope2012..."
- I can read the sign.

333
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:49,315
- It does.
- ".com/imagescmyk/..."

334
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:53,552
- well, but this isn't what...
- "page/carnpaignlqty100123..."

335
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:54,718
You don't need to read
the whole thing.

336
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,620
- "9u/09230023..."
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:58,289
"099twposter..."

338
00:12:58,357 --> 00:13:01,259
- it does say that.
- ". jpeg."

339
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,227
Jpeg.
Yes, Walter, it does say that.

340
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:06,764
You're right, but using basic
logic and human intelligence,

341
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:10,600
one can surmise
that this is a link to an image.

342
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:12,836
This isn't what we wanted
printed on the signs.

343
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:14,338
Whatever's on the order form
I print.

344
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:17,740
In this case, it was a long
string of letters and numbers.

345
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:19,476
Can I just sh... show you
something here? There you go.

346
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:20,610
That's highly
against protocol.

347
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,079
Well, here, look.

348
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:24,581
That's a good sign.

349
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,748
You should've used that.

350
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:29,285
You told April
you were breaking up with me?

351
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:32,488
Ann, we consistently disagree
on "who wore it best."

352
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,556
You still use
an iPad one.

353
00:13:34,624 --> 00:13:37,126
You read books
all the time.

354
00:13:37,194 --> 00:13:39,661
Okay, how about
my "oh-no-nos" for you?

355
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:42,563
You make me see terrible movies,
and then you talk through them.

356
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:45,833
"You put 20" rims
on your volkswagen golf,

357
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,768
and you insist on being
introduced

358
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,537
as "the brown Gosling."

359
00:13:49,605 --> 00:13:53,208
Everything you just said
makes me like me more.

360
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:55,910
I can't take it any more, okay?
I'm breaking you up.

361
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:57,045
You guys are done.

362
00:13:57,113 --> 00:14:00,080
- Fine with me.
- Fine, fine.

363
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:02,216
- Oh, April.
- I'm drunk.

364
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:06,220
You made me drunk,
you made me drunk, and you...

365
00:14:06,287 --> 00:14:09,223
- No, no. Give it a rest.
- I need it.

366
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,157
- Okay.
- Fine.

367
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,591
Let's get you to bed.

368
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,160
You know, why are you guys
even fighting anyway?

369
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,427
It's so stupid.

370
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:16,562
"I hate Ann
because of this stupid reason."

371
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,131
"And I hate Tom
for this stupid reason."

372
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:19,298
Who cares?

373
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,700
- You want some help?
- No, I got it.

374
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:23,969
Well, we did everything, Ron.
We got new signs.

375
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:25,371
We put them
in people's yards.

376
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:28,408
We got Jerry for the surprise...
sinkhole emergency.

377
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:30,475
And, uh,
we briefly ran out of gas,

378
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:31,676
and then we walked
to the gas station.

379
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:33,445
We got more gas,
and now we're all good.

380
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:35,479
Yep, you truly are
attempting to do it all.

381
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,281
Thank you.

382
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:38,150
We didn't get to the drug
store for my liver medication.

383
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:39,451
Well, you should've
thought about that

384
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,219
before we dragged you
out of the bath, Jerry.

385
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:42,687
Yeah.

386
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,822
Okay, wait a second.

387
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,057
This is clearly not
a sinkhole problem.

388
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:47,291
What's going on?

389
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:49,126
Jerry, as soon as
we open this door,

390
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:51,197
everything
will become clear.

391
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:54,865
Surprise!

392
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,670
Oh, what the [Bleep]?

393
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:00,771
Surprise.

394
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:05,483
Where the hell is everybody?

395
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:06,983
Well, it got so late.

396
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,951
We just weren't sure
you were still coming.

397
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:12,588
Everybody's either in bed
or out looking for Champion.

398
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:13,856
Oh, yeah.
Champion ran away.

399
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:15,792
- Wake everybody up.
- Leslie.

400
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,026
No, I am not gonna let this
fall apart.

401
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:18,426
We are gonna throw Jerry

402
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:21,362
an amazing Sweet 16
surprise party

403
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,666
no matter how agonizing it is
for all of us.

404
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,868
That's the spirit.

405
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:28,703
- Champion.
- Champion!

406
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:31,106
Champion, come here, boy.

407
00:15:31,174 --> 00:15:33,341
I have an organic,
gluten-free soy bone for you.

408
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,142
Champion!

409
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,145
Chris, there's something
I have to tell you.

410
00:15:38,863 --> 00:15:41,147
- I ate one of your soy bones.
- Really?

411
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,682
Yeah,
it was really good.

412
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,217
I was gonna give it
to Champion,

413
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:47,020
but it just...
it looked so yummy.

414
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:50,489
The point is,
I'm a terrible dog owner.

415
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:52,292
And I think,
if we find Champion,

416
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,592
you should keep him.

417
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,595
Andy, if it wasn't
for you and April,

418
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:59,097
Champion would still be back
at the pound.

419
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:02,000
You gave him a home.
That's amazing.

420
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,502
And he's your dog.

421
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,271
If you just call out his name,
he will come to you.

422
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,140
What... no, he won't
'cause I've been trying it,

423
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,242
and it didn't work.

424
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,010
I think
he likes your music.

425
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:13,110
Why don't you sing
to him?

426
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:14,678
Really?
I don't have my guitar.

427
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:16,113
- I usually...
- Come on.

428
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:20,184
I feel naked without it, okay.

429
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:25,156

430
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:27,358

Champion, hey!

438
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:45,774
Oh, buddy,
you came back.

439
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:48,377
You came back
to my voice.

440
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:51,180
Dog whistle.

441
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:53,349
- April, wake up.
- Jerry's here.

442
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,449
April.

443
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:55,650
- April.
- Hey.

444
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:58,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

445
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,856
Why is your arm around her?
I broke you up.

446
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,758
Well, we got back together
again 'cause of what you said.

447
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,626
What do you mean?
I didn't say anything.

448
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:07,128
Yeah, when we were
carrying you to bed,

449
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:09,563
you correctly pointed out that
we were arguing about stuff

450
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,565
that was stupid,
and so we talked it out.

451
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:13,567
And I apologized,
and he apologized.

452
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:14,835
And now everything's
great.

453
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:16,004
- Thanks.
- No.

454
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:19,139
I'm drunk.
Don't listen to me, no.

455
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,375
- See you out there.
- No.

456
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,377
- Whoa, thanks, guys.
This is really...

457
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:24,511
this is really great.

458
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,247
Okay, I want
everyone to go around

459
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:29,116
and tell
their favorite Jerry story.

460
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,954
A positive one.

461
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,290
Who's first?

462
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,059
Jerry,
today is your birthday,

463
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,728
but it's about
much more than that.

464
00:17:42,796 --> 00:17:45,898
It's also about Ann and I
getting back together

465
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,167
and being the hottest couple
in Pawnee.

466
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,500
I'd also like
to announce

467
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,503
our official relationship
mash-up name.

468
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,806
It's "Tan."
To Tan.

469
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,075
I would like
to announce that

470
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,077
the name Tan
is officially over.

471
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,711
To the end of Tan.

472
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,481
- Haverkins it is.
- Okay, Donna?

473
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,216
I would like to address
the fact that rule number seven

474
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:10,187
says, "no pets," and yet
there is a three-legged animal

475
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,355
- in my living room.
- Okay, Ron.

476
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,625
Jerry's work
is often adequate.

477
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:22,865
I'll go.

478
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:25,335
Jerry has a wife

479
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:27,636
and three beautiful daughters...
a full life...

480
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:29,105
and that's amazing.

481
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:32,208
April and Andy have Champion,
and that's amazing.

482
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:35,578
I have a stepbrother
who lives in London

483
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:38,046
and 2.8% body fat.

484
00:18:41,345 --> 00:18:42,846
Guys... guys...

485
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:44,853
What do I do?

486
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,188
I mean, she's asleep.

487
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:47,922
You probably should just
sit there and not move.

488
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,592
She's really tired.
Just a few hours.

489
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:51,893
Few hours?

490
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:55,096
Is this all the eggs
we have?

491
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:57,999
Yes.
What are you making?

492
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,066
Eggs.

493
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,905
- Leslie.
- Surprise!

494
00:19:04,973 --> 00:19:07,975
Oh, God.
What happened?

495
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:13,346
Well, you slept
with Jerry last night.

496
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:16,416
No, I was planning Jerry's
morning surprise party.

497
00:19:16,484 --> 00:19:18,151
Morning surprise parties
are always the best.

498
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,085
- Let's get going.
- I made some coffee.

499
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:22,922
Let's go
for a walk.

500
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,824
I now officially insist
that you take a sabbatical.

501
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:27,426
- No, no.
- Let me finish.

502
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,097
I used to work
in a sheet metal factory,

503
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:35,834
but then a job came along
at the tannery.

504
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:38,270
The hours were better,
and I would get paid.

505
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:40,672
Also I'd have the chance
to work with leather

506
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,573
both before
and after it was on the cow,

507
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,043
which had always been
a dream of mine.

508
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,111
I didn't want to give up
my sheet metal job,

509
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:49,947
so I tried to do both jobs
and finish middle school.

510
00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:51,449
How old were you?

511
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,117
11.

512
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:56,187
The point is,
I was so tired,

513
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,888
I tried to puncture
an eight-gauge aluminum foil

514
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:01,358
with a leather awl.

515
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:04,094
- Wow.
- I learned a lesson.

516
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,996
Never half-ass
two things.

517
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:09,199
Whole-ass one thing.

518
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,201
So if you want
to win that seat...

519
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:12,302
Which I do.

520
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,372
Then commit yourself 100%.

521
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,806
Take a sabbatical.

522
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:21,444
I will cut back
to 10 hours a week.

523
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:23,180
Deal.

524
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:26,915
- 15.
- 10.

525
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:28,317
Deal.

526
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,375
Ugh, I can't believe
I got them back together.

527
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:34,810
Now they're always gonna want
to come talk to me about stuff.

528
00:20:34,878 --> 00:20:36,311
Eh, that's a good thing,
babe.

529
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:38,413
They want to talk to you because
you're important to them.

530
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:40,982
Yes, but I hate them.

531
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,383
I know you do,
sweetheart.

532
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:43,652
Oh, hey, uh,
by the way,

533
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:45,487
I think that Chris is lonely,
so I told him he could borrow

534
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:46,488
Champion whenever.

535
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:53,228
- Andy, he's kissing me.
- Aww.

536
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,597
Jerry,
I wanted to say I'm sorry

537
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:57,131
that I screwed up
your birthday party.

538
00:20:57,198 --> 00:20:59,267
- Oh, that's okay.
- But we all pitched in.

539
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,969
And we are sending
you and Gayle to a B&B

540
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:03,371
in your favorite place
in the world.

541
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:05,472
Muncie?

542
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:09,109
Amazingly, yes.
Muncie, Indiana.

543
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,245
Thank you, guys.
It was really expensive.

544
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,881
- Oh, campaign.
- Take it.

545
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,355
Excuse me.

546
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:24,324
If the Bread and Breakfast...

547
00:21:25,092 --> 00:21:26,126
This is Leslie.

548
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:28,702
