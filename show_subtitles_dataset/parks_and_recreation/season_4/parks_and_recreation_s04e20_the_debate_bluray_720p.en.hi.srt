1
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,217
Okay, everybody,
latest poll is

2
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:15,949
Newport, 40%,
Leslie, 32%,

3
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,518
with everyone else way back.

4
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:20,521
Now this debate is our best
chance to close that gap.

5
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,423
Chris, Ann, and Tom, you guys
will be talking to reporters,

6
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,191
providing facts, general spin.

7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,826
- Spin team!
- Spin team!

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,329
This is the best
possible job for me.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,731
I can literally make
anything sound positive.

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,299
Your house just burned down,

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,634
and you lost all your money
in the stock market.

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,169
It's a chance to start over.

13
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:37,937
Fire is cleansing,
and true wealth

14
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,371
is measured by the amount
of love in your life.

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,343
If I had to have anybody
tell me that I had cancer,

16
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,644
I would want it to be me.

17
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:47,312
Ron, April, and Andy,
you'll be throwing

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,747
a party
for our biggest donors.

19
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,482
Ooh,
I can't believe our house

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,451
is going to be full
of rich people

21
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,120
named Dottie
and Todd and Rick.

22
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:57,021
Is the menu all set?

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,890
Yes, I will be providing
several slabs

24
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,692
of my world-famous
Swanson ribs.

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,196
And I will be providing
my world-famous $100 lap dances.

26
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:06,063
- Sweet!
- No.

27
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:07,365
Okay.

28
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:08,633
The election
is in two weeks.

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,101
The debate
is in nine hours.

30
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:12,101
Let's get to work.

31
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:22,375
Sync & corrections by Alice
www.addic7ed.com

32
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:36,892
Wow.

33
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,894
Can't believe
we're doing this here.

34
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:41,430
Seats, like, 800 people.

35
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:42,464
Well, that's what you get
when your opponent's

36
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:44,232
the most famous person
in town.

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,835
This is a lot bigger than my
high school debate auditorium.

38
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:48,837
4 feet.

39
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:50,572
Exact same size
as the podium you use

40
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:51,639
in the Parks department.

41
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,008
Opening statement.

42
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:54,309
I am Leslie Knope.

43
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:56,144
I love this town,

44
00:01:56,212 --> 00:01:57,746
and I've worked my whole life
to make it great.

45
00:01:57,814 --> 00:01:59,347
I believe that
I've earned your vote.

46
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:00,948
Bobby Newport believes
he can buy it.

47
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:02,482
- You got this.
- I got this.

48
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,851
You could debate Newport
in your sleep.

49
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,086
I have.

50
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,220
I know.
We sleep in the same bed.

51
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:07,487
It's been hell.

52
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:09,056
I finally get
a chance to stand

53
00:02:09,124 --> 00:02:12,026
in front of everyone and talk
about the town that I love.

54
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:13,828
What if the town loves Bobby
more than me?

55
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:16,129
There's no way.
You're going to destroy him.

56
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:17,697
I'm going to wipe the floor
with his face.

57
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,999
You're going to rip out
his spine with your teeth

58
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,468
and then chew it up
and gargle with it.

59
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:25,004
I love it when
you're needlessly disgusting.

60
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:26,840
I'm trying to clean up
for the party,

61
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:30,009
but I swear to God,
my arms can't move that way.

62
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:31,344
Leave it messy.
It doesn't matter.

63
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,947
Nothing matters.
Life is garbage.

64
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:36,481
What happened?

65
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,984
Ann broke up with me.
For reals this time.

66
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:41,419
And all I did was call
into this radio station

67
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:42,821
and give her a sweet
little shout-out.

68
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,123
So we're up in the club.

69
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,057
It's me!
We're dancing.

70
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,859
We're sweating.

71
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,393
Let's just say we got
to second that night.

72
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,861
Kind of.
Me so horny.

73
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:52,696
This chick's
name is Ann Perkins.

74
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,966
Look her up
on the government website.

75
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,634
She is crazy hot.
Isn't that great?

76
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,702
Come here.
Aah!

77
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:00,537
I complimented you.

78
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,940
I guess she's just afraid of
how powerful her feelings are.

79
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:05,575
Dude, that's not why
she broke up with you.

80
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,343
You have to stop
your stupid swagger

81
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:10,713
and just tell her in a normal
voice that you care about her.

82
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:12,649
What do you know?
You don't care about things.

83
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,617
Yes, I do,
I care about...

84
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:18,221
Andy...
And champion.

85
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:20,790
And I want Leslie to win,
and I like sleeping.

86
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:22,691
So everybody has things
they care about.

87
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,827
If Ann is yours,
you need to tell her.

88
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,866
Okay, Chris,
hypothetical crisis.

89
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,467
Leslie just tried
to answer a question

90
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:35,637
and audibly farted
then threw up. Spin.

91
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:38,439
Leslie Knope
is literally overflowing

92
00:03:38,507 --> 00:03:40,241
with ideas for this town.

93
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:42,376
And speaking of methane,
have you heard about her plan

94
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:43,778
to limit greenhouse
gas emissions?

95
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:45,246
- Wow.
- Nice.

96
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:46,681
- Spin team!
- Spin team!

97
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,549
Ann and I make
such a great team.

98
00:03:48,617 --> 00:03:50,852
It's silly that we're not
a team in real life.

99
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,119
I just heard those words
come out of my mouth,

100
00:03:52,187 --> 00:03:53,553
and I have made a decision.

101
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:57,424
I've heard that you
and Tom Haverford

102
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,658
are no longer
romantically involved.

103
00:03:58,726 --> 00:03:59,659
Is that true?

104
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,761
Yes, we broke up.

105
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,431
And I honestly can't believe
we ever dated.

106
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:06,967
Does defy logic.

107
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:09,501
Okay, I still have
feelings for you.

108
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,837
Strong feelings.

109
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:13,706
Emotional, primal feelings.

110
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:16,909
And I would like to give
our relationship another try.

111
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:21,780
Chris, we dated for, like,
three months a year ago.

112
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,415
I honestly think
that you've built this

113
00:04:23,483 --> 00:04:25,650
into something
that it wasn't.

114
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:27,652
And according to your rule,

115
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,154
we can't date
because you're my boss.

116
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:30,555
Maybe not for long.

117
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:32,991
If Newport wins,
the city council may replace me.

118
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:37,929
But it would open it up
for us to be together.

119
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:40,264
Would you like that?

120
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,432
Don't answer.
Just think about it.

121
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,236
Come on.
Let's spin.

122
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,074
So you do a lot
of investing?

123
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,575
- We like to dabble.
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:52,809
I recently invested

125
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:55,679
in some shirts I got
at a garage sale.

126
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,981
Left those at Wendy's
on the way home.

127
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,515
So...

128
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,150
The economy.

129
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,388
Hello.

130
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:06,722
You are here

131
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,724
because you gave us money.

132
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:11,560
Now we will give you ribs.

133
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:13,061
Also you will watch
the debate.

134
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,198
If you like the debate,
you'll give us more money.

135
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:19,201
That is all.
Ron Swanson.

136
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,740
Uh-oh. Somebody forgot
to pay the cable bill.

137
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:28,442
Am I right?

138
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,443
It was me.

139
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:31,545
Do it.

140
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:32,713
Fierce. Power.

141
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,515
Pump it up.
2012.

142
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:37,418
Nothing gets me more amped
than Sarah McLachlan.

143
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:39,220
Opening statement.

144
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:41,088
I am Leslie Knope.
I love this town.

145
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,456
I've worked my whole life
to make it great.

146
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:43,657
I believe
I've earned your vote.

147
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,858
Bobby Newport believes
he can buy it.

148
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:47,593
I have the best campaign manager
in the world.

149
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:49,729
I wouldn't say that.
Jen's a killer.

150
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:52,132
You can beat Newport.
I don't know if I can beat her.

151
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,500
Here's what I know.

152
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:55,835
I love you,
and I like you.

153
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:58,604
I love you,
and I like you.

154
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,009
♪ And the home of the ♪

155
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:09,848
♪ brave ♪

156
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:18,056
Your boy looks
a little lost out there.

157
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:19,057
Oh, he'll be fine.

158
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:20,992
Expectations are crazy low.

159
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,460
If he puts
two sentences together

160
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:23,995
without crying,
the press is going to say

161
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:26,129
he's doing surprisingly well,
and if he falls to pieces,

162
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:27,497
he's going to look sympathetic.
It's a win-win.

163
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:30,500
So do you have any idea how long
this is going to take?

164
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:32,235
Good evening, everyone,
and welcome to the event

165
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:36,139
we are doing tonight, which is
a city council candidate debate

166
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:39,209
that we're going to start now.
I'm Perd Hapley.

167
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:43,312
And I am legendary newswoman
Joan Callamezzo, newly single.

168
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,747
It's time
for opening statements.

169
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,283
I am Fester Trim.

170
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:50,252
Many of you know me as the man
who sells you your guns

171
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,455
at the gun-believable
Gun Emporium.

172
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,556
Whoo!

173
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:56,758
I want to tell you
about my idea

174
00:06:56,826 --> 00:07:00,095
for assault rifle
vending machines.

175
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:02,797
You might be thinking,
"what does an adult film star

176
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:04,432
know about politics?"

177
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,534
Well, I've produced
and starred in

178
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:08,936
over 400 adult films
this year alone.

179
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:10,438
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

180
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:12,307
And just like Leslie,
I know

181
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,609
what it's like to be the only
woman in a room full of men.

182
00:07:15,676 --> 00:07:16,910
I am Manrico Della Rossa.

183
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,147
I believe animals are
as important as people.

184
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:22,616
And if elected,
I will fight for them

185
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:24,318
as if they are
my own children.

186
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:25,652
I am Leslie Knope.

187
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,554
I love this town,

188
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,722
and I've worked my whole life
to make it great.

189
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,291
I believe that
I've earned your vote.

190
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:35,294
Bobby Newport believes
he can buy it.

191
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:37,330
And maybe that's because he's
never earned anything

192
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:40,299
his entire life.

193
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:42,735
That... that hurt my feelings.
Hurt my feelings.

194
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:44,570
You're supposed to be
this positive person.

195
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,304
Can't we just talk
about things we like?

196
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,674
Well said.

197
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:51,643
Uh, just a reminder
to our candidates

198
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,878
to keep it civil.

199
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:54,979
Looking at you, Leslie.

200
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,981
Ah, that's okay, Joan.

201
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,816
I'm okay. I'm just...

202
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:01,085
I'm nervous, man.
I'm nervous. Gah.

203
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:03,521
I guess I want
to do a good job

204
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:06,723
because, um, I like it when
people think I do a good job.

205
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,726
And I want your vote
because I want Pawnee and my dad

206
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:12,063
to see what I'm made of.

207
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,665
So let's do this.

208
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:18,201
The wrecking crew.

209
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,102
Who let you guys in?

210
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,503
Hey, Jason.

211
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:26,443
Ease back.

212
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,821
This question
about public safety

213
00:08:29,989 --> 00:08:32,056
comes from Twitter
because apparently,

214
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:34,092
that's something
that happens now.

215
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:38,730
@munchmeat2015 asks,
"Pawnee used 2 b safe.

216
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:41,498
"Some1 stole my car.

217
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,533
"What will u do

218
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,268
"2 make Pawnee safe

219
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:45,903
& can u help me
find my car?"

220
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:47,938
I can assure you,

221
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:51,308
if you had a gun
mounted on the dashboard,

222
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:55,079
which automatically shot people
trying to break into it,

223
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:57,113
you would still have your car.

224
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:59,783
You know, I guess I would like
to tell Mr. Munchmeat

225
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,617
that I think that stinks
that happened to him.

226
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,319
You know, one time
a guy stole

227
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,088
some downhill skis
out of my jeep.

228
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:08,291
And I was so mad,
I punched a mailbox.

229
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:11,561
I'm against crime,
and I'm not ashamed to admit it.

230
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,966
I can't get through
to the cable company.

231
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:19,668
Can you do something?

232
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:22,137
- Like what?
- Anything.

233
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:24,406
Andy's just acting out scenes
from his favorite movies.

234
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,042
So Swayze runs,
boom!

235
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,277
Tackles the guy
off the motorcycle.

236
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:31,645
Dude's like, "you're dead, bro!"
Comes at him.

237
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:33,748
Swayze ducks, scissor kick.
Sha!

238
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:35,249
The guy has Swayze's head.

239
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:37,819
And he says, "I used to [Bleep]
guys like you in prison."

240
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:39,187
By the looks
of this guy,

241
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:41,189
this is not consensual sex
we're talking about.

242
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,623
We see bad guy

243
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,725
had a gun
the whole time.

244
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,393
He's like, "I'ma kill you
the old-fashioned way."

245
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,662
Swayze's like,
"not this time."

246
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:50,797
That's subtext.
He doesn't say that.

247
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:53,333
Bypasses the gun,
hooks the arm.

248
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,835
Back to the secret move
he used before

249
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:56,569
to kill somebody,
he feels so bad about it.

250
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,404
But this time he has to do it
because it's self-defense.

251
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,272
K-k-k-kah!

252
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,242
Takes the esophagus
out of the neck area.

253
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,010
You can't eat.
You'll starve to death.

254
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:07,312
And that is Road House.

255
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,748
What should I do next?

256
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:10,116
Leslie Knope.

257
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:12,417
This question is about
Pawnee's park system.

258
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:16,721
Why is Ramsett Park
so filthy and awful?

259
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,291
It's difficult to get
into the complicated problems

260
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,525
with Ramsett Park in such
a short amount of time.

261
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:23,795
- You have 20 seconds.
- Oh, my God, okay.

262
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,898
I will say that the parks
in Pawnee...

263
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,868
I do have an update
on your time allotment,

264
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:32,770
and that update is that
your time is almost gone.

265
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:34,371
I have no more time left?

266
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:36,874
Well, you had some time
when I started talking,

267
00:10:36,941 --> 00:10:38,776
but by the time I finished,
your time was up.

268
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,110
Thank you very much.

269
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,645
- She's off her game.
- She's fine.

270
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,280
Mr. Newport, rebuttal.

271
00:10:43,347 --> 00:10:46,083
I know this. If something is
dirty, we should clean it up.

272
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:46,984
Let's start there.

273
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:50,953
Right?

274
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:53,656
You know what, I had this
cleaning lady named Yolanda

275
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,091
who was very wise.

276
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,826
She basically raised me.

277
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:59,595
And one day she said,
"little Bobby,

278
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:01,630
I'm not going to clean
your room no mas."

279
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:04,132
And from that day on,
my room was gross.

280
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,366
Really bummed me out.

281
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:07,335
I think we should make
our parks

282
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:08,503
look like my room

283
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,405
after Yolanda
finally, you know,

284
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:12,007
gave in and cleaned it up
for me.

285
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:13,975
If I may, Joan.

286
00:11:14,043 --> 00:11:15,110
That's a very sweet story,
Bobby,

287
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:16,978
but not all of us
have Yolandas

288
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:18,680
who can clean up
our room for us.

289
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:20,014
Some of us believe

290
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:21,448
that you need to roll up
your sleeves

291
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,150
and do the hard work
yourself.

292
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,821
I'd just like to say that,
like Leslie,

293
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:28,655
I don't have people
do my work for me.

294
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:31,192
Leslie and I do
our work ourselves.

295
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,960
My work, of course,
is having sex

296
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:36,062
with men and women
on camera.

297
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,900
Once again, Brandi and Leslie
are essentially the same person.

298
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:44,103
But Bobby Newport is
super handsome and charming,

299
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,873
so that means people
will probably vote for him

300
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:49,508
because there's no justice
in the world.

301
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,777
How do you respond
to Newport's claim

302
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,278
that the city parks
need to be cleaned up?

303
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,680
Leslie Knope works tirelessly
every day,

304
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,350
so our parks can be
the best they can be.

305
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,953
78% of Pawneeans label
our parks "pristine."

306
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,021
And we all know
the better-looking a park is,

307
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,357
the more attention it will get
from lady parks

308
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,025
who want to have sex
with it.

309
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:08,993
Excuse us.

310
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,594
What the hell is wrong with you?

311
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:12,230
We're fighting
for our lives out there.

312
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:14,065
Oh, I don't know.

313
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:15,566
Maybe the fact
that we just broke up,

314
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:16,800
and you're already riding
the Traeger train.

315
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,669
What are you talking about?

316
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,771
I saw you guys getting back
together. What about us?

317
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,373
What about us, Tom?

318
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,507
We're not together
any more

319
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,075
because you keep acting
like an ass.

320
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:26,642
I'm sorry.

321
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,346
I just act that way
sometimes...

322
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,781
Because I'm nervous,
and...

323
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:33,516
I feel like
you're out of my league.

324
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:36,253
But I'd do anything to get back
together with you.

325
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,088
Please.

326
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,756
Vote for me to be
your boyfriend.

327
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,658
Ben, he's winning.
How is he winning?

328
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:44,760
Everything he's saying
is nonsense,

329
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:45,961
and he's fooling them.

330
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,062
Okay, you're doing fine.

331
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,663
I need to go back
on the attack.

332
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,232
No! No, no, no, no, no.
See, okay.

333
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,167
When you attacked, you kind of
came off like a bully,

334
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:53,802
and he looked sympathetic,
so, you know,

335
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,637
y-you did a really good job
of easing off.

336
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:58,873
- Leslie, this is fun, isn't it?
- Yeah.

337
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:00,741
Well, there's no reason
on earth that I can think of

338
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:02,877
that we shouldn't have
concussion grenades

339
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,046
in our nation's
movie theaters.

340
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,647
By the year 2013,
we will have

341
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:08,816
a fully functional mall
on Jupiter.

342
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:11,786
Sure, I agree that movies
should be more faithful

343
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:13,153
to the books that
they are based on,

344
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:14,687
but what does that have
to do with this election?

345
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:16,556
All my movies
are based on books.

346
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:19,725
And anyone who even
rubs their hands

347
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,894
on a leather jacket

348
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,896
should be tried for murder.

349
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:27,033
I'm an American.
My father is an American.

350
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,835
My mother is an American.

351
00:13:29,903 --> 00:13:31,870
My godfather is the viceroy

352
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:33,739
of the principality
of Liechtenstein.

353
00:13:33,807 --> 00:13:37,508
Once again, people,
grenade launcher.

354
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:39,510
Daniel Craig.

355
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:42,880
No...
Timothy Dalton.

356
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:45,583
I was in favor of closing
the borders bookstore,

357
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:47,319
not the border to Mexico.

358
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:50,121
I guess my thoughts
on abortion are...

359
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,755
You know, let's just all
have a good time.

360
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:54,791
I don't care about that issue.
Just ask someone else.

361
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,260
For the record,
I'd appear in a film

362
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,728
with any
of my fellow candidates.

363
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,500
- Anteaters.
- Kill shot.

364
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,202
- Money shot.
- Fudgsicles.

365
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,070
Let's spend our money
on what matters.

366
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,038
Police, fire,

367
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,639
parks, and schools.

368
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:15,611
After a rough start,
your girl's doing okay.

369
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,281
Um, I think she's doing
a little better than okay.

370
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:19,983
Or did you miss
the applause

371
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,517
she got on
the raccoon safety question?

372
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:22,952
Oh, that was great.

373
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,653
That probably pulled her even
with Bobby.

374
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:27,456
I can't believe you're
so casual about this.

375
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:28,756
Don't you even want
to win the debate?

376
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:30,758
Oh, we're gonna win
the debate.

377
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:31,960
Got an ace in the hole.

378
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:34,629
- Little surprisey-wisey.
- What?

379
00:14:34,697 --> 00:14:36,564
Oh, you'll see.
Hey, quick question.

380
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:38,300
Does that guy Chris Traeger
have a girlfriend,

381
00:14:38,368 --> 00:14:39,300
and is his penis normal?

382
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:40,968
Stop talking.

383
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:44,771
You guys, uh, know anything
about a guy named John Rambo?

384
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,542
Open on villagers being
thrown out into a rice field.

385
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,111
Land mines blowing them up
into pieces.

386
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,912
After I steal
this cable feed,

387
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,848
I will repay the cable company
for the service we used.

388
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:02,889
This last question
before the break

389
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,924
is for Mr. Newport.

390
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:08,395
Uh, some... not me... have
criticized your involvement

391
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:10,763
with your father's
candy company Sweetums.

392
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:13,232
Would your affiliation
with big business

393
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:15,501
affect your decisions
as a city councilor?

394
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,936
I want to run this town
like a business.

395
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,105
My opponent, Leslie Knope,

396
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,841
has a very
anti-business agenda.

397
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:25,844
Recently, my dad told me
that if Leslie Knope

398
00:15:25,912 --> 00:15:27,245
wins the election,

399
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:29,280
they'll probably have to
move Sweetums to Mexico.

400
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,617
That would be terrible,
of course.

401
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,119
Thousands of people
in this town

402
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:38,022
would lose their jobs,
and we all wouldn't have candy.

403
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,425
Now, I'm not saying
that is gonna happen,

404
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:41,892
but I do know this.

405
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,494
If I win...

406
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:46,396
I bet I could
get them to stay.

407
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,400
Wow. Shocking stuff.

408
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:52,702
We're gonna be back
with our closing statements

409
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,837
right after a word
from our sponsor, Sweetums,

410
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:57,640
Pawnee's biggest supplier
of candy and jobs.

411
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,375
Stick around.

412
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:01,295
So Sweetums is gonna
move to Mexico

413
00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:02,597
if Bobby doesn't win?

414
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:04,065
How could they do that
to this town?

415
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,367
- What a crappy stunt to pull.
- One minute back.

416
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:08,169
What do we do?
I think we attack him.

417
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:09,838
He's more confident now.
I have to attack him.

418
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:11,673
And say what?
We didn't plan for this.

419
00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:13,207
- What would you even say?
- I don't know.

420
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:14,508
I'll figure out
as I'm saying it.

421
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,844
Just let me attack him.
I want to attack him.

422
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:18,345
No, no, no, no.
It's too risky.

423
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,980
Just go with the closing
statement we rehearsed.

424
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,116
Add a line at the end
about how you're pro business,

425
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:25,120
and we'll deal with
the fallout tomorrow, okay?

426
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,688
What?
What's the matter with you?

427
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:32,224
I can do it.
I can crush him.

428
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,159
I promise.

429
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,764
Ah, screw it.
Go get him.

430
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,534
- Really?
- Kick his ass.

431
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:47,605
♪ I am lineman
for the county ♪

432
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,609
♪ and the Wichita lineman ♪

433
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:02,452
♪ Is still the line ♪

434
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,554
The final thing
these candidates will say

435
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:06,523
are their closing statements.

436
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,393
We will begin with our first
candidate to go, Bobby Newport.

437
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,863
How do we fix this town?
I have no idea.

438
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,331
You tell me.

439
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,433
That's what I'm counting on.
You telling me.

440
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:19,702
And that's how it ends.

441
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,705
I loved it.
It's called Babe.

442
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,308
And I know it sounds corny.
Talking pig. Whatever.

443
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,443
You should all see it.

444
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:30,346
I feel like I just did.

445
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:31,614
It's on.

446
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:34,116
And, Leslie Knope,
closing statement?

447
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:39,454
I'm very angry.

448
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:43,091
I'm angry
that Bobby Newport

449
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,993
would hold this town hostage

450
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:46,929
and threaten to leave

451
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:48,897
if you don't give him
what he wants.

452
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:51,165
It's despicable.

453
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:54,802
Corporations are not allowed
to dictate what a city needs.

454
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,204
That power belongs
to the people.

455
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:00,374
Bobby Newport and his daddy
would like you to think

456
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:02,576
it belongs to them.

457
00:18:02,644 --> 00:18:04,278
I love this town.

458
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:07,547
And when you love something,
you don't threaten it.

459
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:11,517
You don't punish it.
You fight for it.

460
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:14,787
You take care of it.
You put it first.

461
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:17,290
As your city councilor,

462
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:21,227
I will make sure that no one
takes advantage of Pawnee.

463
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:25,297
If I seem too passionate,
it's because I care.

464
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:29,601
If I come on strong,
it's because I feel strongly.

465
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,770
And if push too hard,

466
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:34,539
it's because things aren't
moving fast enough.

467
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:38,309
This is my home.
You are my family.

468
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:41,512
And I promise you...

469
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,581
I'm not going anywhere.

470
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,752
Holy [Bleep], Leslie,
that was awesome.

471
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,824
Thanks, Bobby.

472
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,499
Yeah!
Play it. Woo-hoo!

473
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:04,668
Knope 2012!

474
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:07,136
Hyah! Hyah!

475
00:19:10,174 --> 00:19:10,973
Ron!

476
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,875
What the voters
saw tonight

477
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,143
is an undeniable fact.

478
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:16,679
That one of these candidates
is right for this town,

479
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:20,048
and one of them is not.
Thanks, guys.

480
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:21,684
Ann Perkins!
Uh-oh.

481
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:24,019
I'm sorry, Chris.

482
00:19:24,086 --> 00:19:26,087
It's very flattering.
I just...

483
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:28,856
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

484
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,758
It was worth a shot.

485
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:33,127
Well, I hope that
whoever you end up with

486
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:36,197
treats like you like
the amazing person that you are.

487
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:37,498
Thank you.

488
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:39,467
And I am going to go
run some stairs

489
00:19:39,535 --> 00:19:42,669
and work through
these feelings.

490
00:19:42,737 --> 00:19:44,371
- Is he sad?
- Oh, my God.

491
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,706
He looks sad.

492
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:47,407
I'm not going out
with Chris again.

493
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:48,475
Does that mean we're
getting back together?

494
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:50,009
No. I don't know.

495
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:50,945
No, not right now.

496
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:52,046
There's a chance
I'm never

497
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:53,647
gonna date anyone
ever again.

498
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:56,817
I'll take it.
And you know what else?

499
00:19:57,385 --> 00:19:59,117
I'm coming for you, girl...

500
00:19:59,185 --> 00:20:02,421
Just... Like... You... Want.

501
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,190
Just get out there
and spin, man.

502
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:05,859
You got it.

503
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:08,228
Leslie Knope is scrappy
like a terrier.

504
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:10,897
She's smoooooth
like a blended whiskey.

505
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:13,432
My girl has big ideas
and big feelings,

506
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,733
and she's not afraid
to express 'em.

507
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,736
- Was I too mean?
- No, you were perfect.

508
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:18,971
- Leslie!
- Hey!

509
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:21,039
- Oh, it was amazing.
- Oh, thank you.

510
00:20:21,107 --> 00:20:22,707
Hey, how was the spin room?

511
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:24,109
It was a lot.
We'll talk about it.

512
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:25,810
Woo! We did it!
We did it!

513
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:28,380
Oh, my God, I was so nervous,
but we completely go through it.

514
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:29,748
I haven't felt this good
since I scored

515
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:31,582
that lacrosse goal
at state, seriously.

516
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,217
Hey, party at my dad's
lake house.

517
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:35,486
Bring whoever you want.

518
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,093
Scrawny Christians,
missionaries,

519
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,628
come to him, and they're like,
"Are you John Rambo?"

520
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:46,829
He's like, "yeah."

521
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,931
And they're like, "we need you
to take us upriver."

522
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,833
And he's like,
"it's a war zone up there."

523
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,167
And they're like,
"yeah, we know.

524
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:54,203
We're gonna change things."

525
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,873
And he's like, "you bringing
any weapons?"

526
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,207
They're like, "of course not."

527
00:20:58,274 --> 00:20:59,574
"Then you're not
changing anything.

528
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,109
Go home."

529
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,777
And then they come back
in a rainstorm.

530
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,615
This time he says,
"nope. Go home."

531
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,216
They go home again.

532
00:21:08,283 --> 00:21:11,219
Bottom line, they go upriver.
Does not go well.

533
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:16,565
