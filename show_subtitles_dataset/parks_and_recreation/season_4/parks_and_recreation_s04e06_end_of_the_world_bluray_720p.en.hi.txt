00:00:03,651 --> 00:00:06,785
Miss Leslie Knope,
I present to you Herb Scaifer.

2
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,503
Again, Andy,
you don't need to bow.

3
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:09,588
As you wish, ma'am.

4
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:11,056
Okay, Herb,
what can I do you for?

5
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:14,476
Well, please prepare yourself.
I have terrible news.

6
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,361
You do?

7
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,930
The world is going
to end tomorrow at dawn.

8
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:20,515
Aw nuts.
You sure it's tomorrow?

9
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:22,872
Afraid so.
Right at dawn.

10
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:25,596
The entire planet...

11
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,779
- Gone.
- Not giving me much notice, Herb.

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,573
- Let me see what I can do.
- Okay.

13
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:32,474
For a while in the 1970s,

14
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:34,874
our town was run by a freaky cult.

15
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,374
Every few years,

16
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,874
the remaining members predicted
the world's gonna end.

17
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,843
And they have an all-night
vigil in the park.

18
00:00:41,377 --> 00:00:42,978
It's super annoying.

19
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:45,014
Turns out when you think
the world's ending,

20
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:48,217
you don't aim so carefully
in the port-a-potties.

Tonight, the followers
of "Reasonableism"

24
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:13,987
will be joining together to
await the return of Zorp.

The giant lizard god who

00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:20,312
Also light refreshments
will be served.

28
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,893
Oh, last year they had pizza.
Are they gonna have pizza again?

29
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,457
Uhm... says they've got
turkey sandwiches

30
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:28,057
and the nectar
of a thousand sorrows.

00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:31,002
Oh, that is so good!
It's root beer and red wine.

32
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:34,025
I went to one meeting.

33
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:37,607
Wait!

34
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:40,396
Gonna miss you,
enormous chair.

35
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:43,616
- You really sat on this thing?
- Yes! I loved it.

36
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:45,973
Felt like a tiny king.

37
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,474
T-cup!
We did it, baby.

38
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:54,846
We built a company
from the ground up.

39
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:56,848
And the we ran it
back into the ground.

40
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,756
The important thing to remember...
is that it was a massive success.

41
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:02,480
Remy Martin?

42
00:02:02,483 --> 00:02:04,551
Well, Entertainment720 is dead.

43
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:06,086
It's up in company heaven.

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,823
Along with pets.com,
Blockbuster and Askjeeves.

45
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:11,991
My company is no better
than a company where you ask

46
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:15,095
a fake butler
to Google things for you.

47
00:02:15,487 --> 00:02:17,014
Hello!

48
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:20,810
So it looks like we'll each
end up with about $5,000 apiece.

49
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,410
Stop.

50
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,624
We get five g's each?
That's amazing!

51
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,751
You started out with 450,000.

52
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:31,581
Remember when DJ Bluntz made us
our own personal entrance beat?

53
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:33,087
Remember the opening night party

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,487
when you danced so hard
with Tess the recepcionist

55
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,015
and you broke one of your ribs?

56
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,615
It never healed properly.

57
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:41,719
Every breath is agony.

58
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:44,879
Stop.

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,851
So what's next,
Tommy Davidson?

60
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:48,619
I say we invest our ten large

61
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,366
and then I "accidentally"
get run over by a city bus.

62
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,455
and we start our own
hip-hop label.

63
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,892
Listen, we could play it safe.

64
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:58,030
But that's not what
e720 is all about.

65
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,724
No, it is not.

66
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:01,663
We have this place
for one more night, right?

67
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,267
We're outtie tomorrow
at noon.

68
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:06,615
What if we took
every dime we had left,

69
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:08,339
threw one last party.

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,151
Made it the essence of everything
we wanted the company to be.

71
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:12,157
A party...

72
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:14,857
For the end of the world.

73
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:18,157
Shh! You had me at
"every dime we have left."

74
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,593
Because I'm in
like Lara Flynn...

75
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:23,343
Boyle... from "The Practice."

76
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:27,603
Dilly dilly dilly
dilly dilly dilly dilly swag!

77
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:30,756
Why does the cult call
themselves "The Reasonableists"?

78
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,092
Well, they figure if
people criticize them

79
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,193
it'll seem like they're

80
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:35,528
attacking something
very reasonable.

81
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,129
That's weirdly brilliant.

82
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:38,564
Look, there's nothing
to worry about.

83
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,633
They've said that the world
is going to end 15 times.

84
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:41,984
And the only bad thing
that's ever happened

85
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:43,569
on any of those dates is

86
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:46,472
Lance Armstrong
dumping Sheryl Crow.

87
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,291
- That was a tragic day.
- Hmm.

88
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,176
Live strong.

89
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,462
In any rate, I think Ben and I
should accompany you tonight.

90
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:55,081
Oh, I don't think
we have to do that.

91
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,615
No, no, no, I insist.

92
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:59,485
These people
live on planet nutbrain.

93
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,221
I live on planet nut bran.

94
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:04,006
Bran and nuts are very
helpful for your colon!

95
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:05,007
Well, it looks like
we're kind of forced

96
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:06,625
to hang out with each other.

97
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:08,511
Yeah, listen,
I'll... I'll come for a bit,

98
00:04:08,562 --> 00:04:10,830
but if it's okay with you,
I'm not going to stay.

99
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:15,101
It's just, you know,
still kind of weird, right?

100
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:16,936
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,771
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
mm-hmm, totally get it.

102
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,305
Definitely get it.

103
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:21,824
Ben and I don't
hang out much these days.

104
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,876
Big deal,
lots of people don't hang out.

105
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,147
Jerry and April.
Obama and Madonna, probably.

106
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:29,098
We're in good company.

107
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:31,752
What should we do tonight?

108
00:04:31,786 --> 00:04:33,620
I don't know, I just figure
we'll just order some pizza.

109
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:35,004
You watch me play Xbox,

110
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,306
and then I could watch you
make some prank phone calls?

111
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,740
We get hammered?
Make out?

112
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,609
We do that every night.

113
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:42,812
That's because repetition
is the key to a good marriage.

114
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,282
Let's do something weird.

115
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:47,100
Come on, it could be
the last night on earth.

116
00:04:47,134 --> 00:04:49,085
We could do something
off my bucket list.

117
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,486
You have a bucket list?

118
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:53,089
Catch the winning touchdown
at the super bowl.

119
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:55,591
Make the most amazing
grilled-cheese sandwich ever.

120
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:57,310
Win the lottery.
Ride a unicycle.

121
00:04:57,361 --> 00:04:58,192
Invent something.

122
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:00,216
Fly first class on a plane.

123
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,733
And when people are walking by,

124
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,233
be like this:

125
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:07,463
Go skydiving.
Outrun a hippo.

126
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:09,920
I'd like to remake the movie
Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal

127
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,821
where he plays a genie
and I'd like to get it right.

128
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:13,026
Teach my son

129
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,026
to throw the perfect spiral.

130
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:18,900
Have a son.

131
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,939
All right, well, this
is what we're doing tonight.

132
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,800
Wait, which one?

133
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,667
We can change my cell phone plan.

134
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:25,867
- That would be fun.
- No.

135
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,365
This one.

136
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,936
800, 900, 1,000.

137
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,839
And how much
is left in the bank account?

138
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,440
18 dollars
and four cents.

139
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:35,442
Whoa!
Still a lot left over.

140
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:39,779
Okay, you wanted to hold
$1,000 cash in your hands?

141
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:46,953
That's super disappointing.

142
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,641
998, 999, 1000.

143
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:52,092
Yes!

144
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:54,845
Now this is what I imagined!

145
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,434
Have you ever seen this much
cash in your entire life?

146
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:01,985
I just handed it to you.

147
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,304
Nickels!

148
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,305
I want nickels.

149
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,274
- A billion nickels!
- No, Andy.

150
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:09,696
Hey, Herb?

151
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:11,696
— Yeah? - Sorry to bother you.
- Yeah, sure.

152
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:14,443
Leslie says you still need
to pay for the permit, it's $28.

153
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,219
Oh, I'm sorry.

154
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,219
Here's the check.

155
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,466
You can cash that tomorrow.

156
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:23,529
Evening, gentlemen, ladies.

157
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,628
- Hey, Ron!
- Hail Zorp.

158
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,429
How are you?

159
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,429
I'm great.

160
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,448
It is a beautiful night
for the end of the world.

161
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:32,901
Congratulations to all of you
for reaching the finish line.

162
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:35,204
The Zorpies are ridiculous.

163
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,289
But, like the founding fathers,

164
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:40,075
I believe in absolute
freedom of religion.

165
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,812
Also their ceremonies require
the playing of flutes.

166
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:47,950
I happen to make flutes
in my wood shop.

167
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:50,352
Flutes are $80 apiece.

168
00:06:50,387 --> 00:06:52,254
And recorders are 150.

169
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:55,157
Hey, they're beautiful.

170
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:56,458
Would you take a check?

171
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:57,644
Sure.

172
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,944
Welcome to E720's

173
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:03,862
end of the world celebration.

174
00:07:03,896 --> 00:07:06,198
The entire party's a VIP area.

175
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:07,816
There's also
a double VIP area.

176
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,618
A triple VIP area.

177
00:07:09,652 --> 00:07:11,703
And the Centurion Club
elite VIP area.

178
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,038
Sponsored by Sobe Lifewater.

179
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,007
- No one's allowed in there,
not even us. - Uh-uh.

180
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:17,269
We have not one,
but six open bars.

181
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,678
And best of all,
Snake Juice ice fountain.

182
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:20,979
Show 'em, T!

183
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,700
Juice is so chilled!

184
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:23,985
Craps!

185
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:24,985
Roulette!

186
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,213
Ahrrr!

187
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:30,166
Pirate ship bouncy castle
with bubbles.

188
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,850
Shrimp wall.

189
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,221
And special VIP
shrimp distributor

190
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,421
Indiana Pacers' Center
Roy Hibbert.

191
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,223
Is all you want me to do?

192
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,923
Pass out shrimp
to people at the party?

193
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:43,034
Yes, and stop
asking questions!

194
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:45,313
Got a head?
Maybe you want a free Fedora.

195
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,117
Wanna make out?
Go to out make out room.

196
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:49,681
And before you leave,
don't forget the gift bag.

197
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:52,053
Jean-Ralphio, there are animals
on the guest list tonight?

198
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,848
Let me check, T.T.
Oh, just one.

199
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,893
Bengal Tiger!

200
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:59,128
We also hired ten huge, scary
bouncers with earpieces.

201
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:00,551
- What up, Keith?
- Mmm.

202
00:08:00,552 --> 00:08:02,564
He actually once tossed me
out of a club three years ago.

203
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,659
Water under the bridge.

204
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:06,172
DJ Bluntz is mixing up
some new beats.

205
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:09,016
Only 200 people will be admitted
to retain exclusivity.

206
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,202
Ballers and ballerettes,
fasten your seatbelts.

207
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,820
The perfect party begins...

208
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:15,289
Clink! Now.

209
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:18,959
Thank God.

210
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:21,495
No one shows up
to a good party on time.

211
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:22,997
If anybody actually
showed up right now,

212
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,131
the whole party
would have been ruined.

213
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:25,216
It would have been
a disaster.

214
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,700
I don't want
to go to that party.

215
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:29,637
Does the city consider them
a threat to public safety?

216
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,756
Oh, not at all,
Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

217
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,570
It's been over 30 years,

218
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:36,489
since there's any incident
involving the Reasonableists.

219
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,374
So I shouldn't interpret
anything from the fact

220
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,409
that there are two people from
the city manager's office here?

221
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:43,111
Well, nothing except that
I had nothing better to do.

222
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,713
Which probably says
more about me than them.

223
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:46,615
Thanks.

224
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,617
- Thanks.
- Headline idea.

225
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,352
"It's the end of the world
as they know it,

226
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,954
but Pawnee feels fine."

227
00:08:51,972 --> 00:08:54,723
- It's a little long.
- Okay, "Zorp Shmorp!

228
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:56,425
"Doomsday prediction
falls flat

229
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,227
"as citizens spend
pleasant evening

230
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:00,229
enjoying one of Pawnee's
finest parks."

231
00:09:00,263 --> 00:09:01,597
Somehow longer.

232
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:02,898
Right, okay let's
go with the first one.

233
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,151
Great, um, hey, also...

234
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:07,135
He's cute.
Is he single, do you know?

235
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:08,470
Chris? No.

236
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:10,105
He's actually
dating Jerry's daughter.

237
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,208
Oh, no sorry, I meant Ben.
What's his story?

238
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:14,176
- Who?
- Ben?

239
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:16,278
I-I don't know.

240
00:09:16,312 --> 00:09:19,198
I... I'm not s...
I'm not sure.

241
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:21,483
He's, um,
a man and he's a worker.

242
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,588
And he is... uh, we've never
discussed sex, so...

243
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:28,624
It's... we've always just been
very businesslike, so...

244
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,327
Your guess is as good...
nay, better than mine.

245
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:34,329
The end.
By Leslie Knope.

246
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:37,600
Okay.
Cool, thanks.

247
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:39,668
H... happy to help.

248
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:41,205
What's happening?

249
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:44,273
The world is ending.

250
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:48,173
Oh boy, I know how this goes.

251
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:49,730
I know how Shauna operates.

252
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:51,398
She smiles,
and then they fall in love,

253
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:52,749
and then they get married,

254
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:54,968
and then she changes her name
to Shauna Malwae-Wyatt.

255
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:56,586
Or he's going
to be really progressive

256
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:58,605
and change his name to
Ben Wyatt-Malwae-Tweep.

257
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,591
God, I am so annoyed that he
would hypothetically do that.

258
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,591
Okay...
Leslie, they're just talking.

259
00:10:04,592 --> 00:10:06,831
What do you mean "just talking"?
He's smiling.

260
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:08,124
And she seems very charming.

261
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,424
Is she more charming than me?

262
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:12,121
Ann, if you say "yes",
I will kick you. I swear to God.

263
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:13,457
You're definitely more charming.

264
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,406
But I'm here
to remind you

265
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,757
that the reason
you're not dating him

266
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:18,709
is because you decided
to run for city council.

267
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:20,544
Oh, so just because
I can't go out with him,

268
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,879
someone else can?

269
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:22,631
Oh, boy.

270
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:23,431
- Wow.
- Okay.

271
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:26,567
I'm sure
this is nothing.

272
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,103
Okay, well, that was
definitely something.

273
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:30,488
- Oh. My God.
- I know that move.

274
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:31,605
They're gonna
have sex in five minutes.

275
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:32,990
I've gotta stop this.

276
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:34,358
I've got to keep them
away from each other

277
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:35,226
for the rest of their lives.

278
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:38,079
- How are you gonna do that?
- Unclear!

279
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:41,699
Oh, yeah, ten bucks!

280
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:42,867
That counts as
winning the lottery.

281
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,504
Okay, now is this
the most amazing

282
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:48,572
grilled-cheese
sandwich ever made?

283
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,708
Mmm, it's pretty awesome.

284
00:10:51,242 --> 00:10:52,576
Honey, my bucket list
doesn't say

285
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,312
"make a pretty awesome
grilled-cheese sandwich."

286
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:56,647
Gotta go back to the store.

287
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,149
We're gonna get
a different kind of cheese.

288
00:10:58,183 --> 00:10:59,266
No, no, no, dude, seriously.

289
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:00,651
This is the most amazing
grilled-cheese sandwich

290
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:01,719
ever made, okay?

291
00:11:01,753 --> 00:11:03,721
Okay. What's next?

292
00:11:03,755 --> 00:11:06,891
Hey, there you are.
Wow, you two are still talking?

293
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:08,459
Ben hasn't bored you
to death by now.

294
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,594
- Hey.
- So boring.

295
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:12,362
Actually, we were having
a really great talk.

296
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,765
- Keep your pants on.
- What?

297
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,367
I mean,
keep your pants on, girl!

298
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:18,002
I mean, those are
really nice pants.

299
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:19,603
I really like your pants.
Where'd you get them?

300
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,455
Do you want to go
buy some more pants?

301
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,940
Or, um, walk away from here?

302
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,945
Actually. I think I have
everything I needed here,

303
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:27,030
but I might head over to
that end of the world party.

304
00:11:27,064 --> 00:11:28,732
Oh, that's where all
the losers are going.

305
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:30,667
Yeah, what is that?
Tom emailed me.

306
00:11:30,701 --> 00:11:33,236
- I could check that out.
- Hurrrrr...

307
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,939
Well, then you should
stay here then.

308
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:37,674
Because you can't go.

309
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,609
I mean, what if you're
not here when Zorp shows up?

310
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:40,777
Boy, would your face be red.

311
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:42,479
When Zorp shows up,

312
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:47,083
your faces will be
melted off and used as fuel.

313
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:48,985
You want to be here
for that.

314
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,320
I think
I'll take my chances.

315
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:52,973
Leslie, thanks as always.

316
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:56,960
Wow. What an unbelievably
unpleasant person.

317
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,347
Melissa, get in there

318
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:01,765
- with your bad self.
- All right.

319
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,400
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

320
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:05,001
Anything you grab
is yours to keep.

321
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:06,186
Hit it!

322
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:07,971
Yes!

323
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,907
The perfect party.
It's an elusive idea.

324
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:12,859
People have to be
completely entertained

325
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,779
from the moment they walk in,
to the moment they leave.

326
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:17,414
It's a grand experiment.

327
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:20,584
And I... am a party scientist.

328
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:22,586
Welcome to my laboratory.

329
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:29,718
So you were living here when
"Reasoneableism" first swep in?

330
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:32,828
I was.
Lou Prozotovich, their founder,

331
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:35,227
was an office supplies salesman.

332
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:37,732
One day, he had an interesting idea.

333
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:41,185
Maybe he can write a book to
help people organize their offices.

334
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:42,794
"Organize it!"

335
00:12:43,186 --> 00:12:44,894
The book was a big success.

336
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:48,095
Then Lou had another
interesting thought.

337
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:53,248
Maybe there is a 28-foot tall lizard
with a volcano for a mouth

338
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:55,592
- who controls the universe.
- That is interesting.

339
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:56,588
So he wrote a second book.

340
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:59,306
"Organize it 2:
Engage with Zorp"

341
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:01,003
You know... could I have
a look at that?

342
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:03,008
Well sure you can, Chris.

343
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:04,882
You can keep it.

344
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:08,131
I'd skip the first couple
of chapters if I were you,

345
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:12,727
between you and me, it doesn't
really get good till Zorp shows up.

346
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:14,745
Zorp is the lizard.

347
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,453
What religion am I?

348
00:13:16,454 --> 00:13:20,598
Well, I'm a practicing none

00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:55,145
Buddhists feel

00:18:57,882 --> 00:19:00,317

with reincarnation

482
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,419
is that you could be
reborn as a pretzel.

00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:04,688
Or a socket wrench.

be reincarnated,

Socket wrench sounds
pretty good, actually.

487
00:19:11,014 --> 00:19:13,983
I think the danger in
believing in reincarnation

488
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:15,818
is that you spend so much
time trying to figure out

489
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,520
what you're going to be
in the next lifetime

490
00:19:17,554 --> 00:19:19,989

00:20:40,443 --> 00:20:42,029
I mean for everything.

523
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:50,235
I actually forgot
they ever dated.

524
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:52,071
I was trying to hit that.

525
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:55,507
Dawn is nigh!

526
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,577
Zorp the surveyor approaches,

527
00:20:58,611 --> 00:21:02,113
and all earthly debts
will be repaid

528
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:05,470
to the original source
of life in the universe.

529
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:08,020
Last call for doughnuts.

00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,520
What would you do
if the word was really gonna end?

531
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,419
I'd go home,
drink some whisky.

532
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,619
Then I'd go
see my ex-wives.

533
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,820
- Really?
- Yeah.

534
00:21:22,422 --> 00:21:25,520
I wanna watch them meet
their fiery end with my own eyes.

535
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,420
What would you do?

536
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:31,719
Can I speak with you
about a personal matter?

537
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:34,856
Normally, no.

538
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,175
But... given there's
only 20 minutes

539
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:39,060
until the end
of human existence...

540
00:21:39,494 --> 00:21:40,661
Also, no.

541
00:21:40,696 --> 00:21:42,263
I lost my mind tonight.

542
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:46,167
I tried to screw up
even the potential of Ben

543
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:47,501
dating someone else.

544
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:49,270
Did you not hear me
when I said no?

545
00:21:49,304 --> 00:21:51,439
Oh, we broke up
because of me.

546
00:21:51,973 --> 00:21:55,109
But I have to
tell you, Ron...

547
00:21:57,045 --> 00:21:59,513
If the world
was ending tomorrow,

548
00:22:00,248 --> 00:22:02,583
I'd want to be with him.

549
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:06,454
Well, that's significant.

550
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:10,458
Problem is, Leslie, the world's
not ending tomorrow.

551
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:12,894
The sun's going to rise
right over there.

552

554
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:20,401
I know.

555
00:22:20,703 --> 00:22:22,743
I made my decision,
I need to stick to it.

556
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:25,120
It's just the thought
of him with someone else

557
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,420
is making me miserable.

558
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:29,020
If it makes you feel
any better, Leslie,

559
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:31,188
we'll all be dead

Thank you, Herb.
