1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,633
Oh, goody, you're all here.

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:06,489
Now, I know I'm not supposed to talk
about my campaign in the office,

3
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:09,640
but last night I've made a decision
about who should be my campaign manager.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,577
This is a huge job.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,813
This is going to require
a lot of late night,

6
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,765
one-on-one jam sessions
with me,

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,283
and we're going to bounce ideas
off of each other,

8
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,434
you're going to have to take
calls for me,

9
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:20,220
any time, day or night.

10
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:25,225
The person I have chosen is,
drum roll please,

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,697
Ann Perkins! Yay!
Give it up for Ann!

12
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,733
Good choice.

13
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,735
Leslie, I don't know the first
thing about running

14
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,770
a political campaign.

15
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,739
Ann, you beautiful tropical fish.

16
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:42,959
You're smart as a whip
and you're cool under pressure.

17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,178
You've resuscitated a human
heart in your bare hands.

18
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,613
No, I haven't.

19
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,181
- You haven't?
- No!

20
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,216
You will.
You're that good of a nurse.

21
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,467
What about Ben?

22
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,436
I mean, he ran for mayor
at 18 and won.

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,755
Ben is poison in my campaign.

24
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:58,424
Our relationship is the reason
why my advisors pulled out.

25
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,809
- I...
- Ann,

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,761
don't listen to your head
or your heart.

27
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,596
Just look at my eyes
and say "yes."

28
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,264
- Okay, yes.
- Yes!

29
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:07,099
- I believe in you, Ann.
- Thank you.

30
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:08,785
And your first job
as my campaign manager

31
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,570
is to start dressing like one.

32
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,322
I don't want to have this
conversation again.

33
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:15,107
Again? You just hired me eight
seconds ago.

34
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,743
Wow. You're doing
a really bad job.

36
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:40,483
- William, Elizabeth.
- Leslie, hi.

37
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,169
Hi. What are you...
Are you coming to see me?

38
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,038
Did you hear that I'm
relaunching my campaign?

39
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,439
Actually, no, sorry.

40
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,708
We weren't here to see you.
We've been meeting with

41
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,476
other potential candidates
for city council.

42
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:54,247
Oh, really? So, my campaign
ends and, just like that,

43
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,015
you find someone else and run theirs?

44
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,951
Yes, that's our job.

45
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,687
I know.
Good luck, but, uh,

46
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,022
I just had a big meeting
with my new advisory board,

47
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:05,858
and they're brilliant and amazing.

48
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,660
They're real killers.

49
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:10,213
Leslie, I tried to make
ramen in the coffee pot

50
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,881
and I broke everything.

51
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,933
Thank you, Andy.
I'll be right in.

52
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,386
Well, uh, good luck,
Leslie. Honestly.

53
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,672
Well, we don't need luck.
We are a rocket ship.

54
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,041
We are relaunching,
and we're going to blast past

55
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:24,277
your cann...
Huh, they're gone.

56
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,280
It's true... I no longer have
highly-trained,

57
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,283
professional campaign managers.
So what?

58
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,819
Are most murders committed by
highly-trained,

59
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,871
professional assassins?
No.

60
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,891
They're committed by friends
and coworkers.

61
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,927
That analogy was way better
in my head.

62
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,334
Hi.

63
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:53,256
Champion? Oh my gosh,
there you are, puppy.

64
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,275
- That's a good boy.
- That is a three-legged dog.

65
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,063
His name is Champion, because
he's the dog world champion.

66
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,714
Okay, I have to ask this, I'm sorry,

67
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:04,216
but how many legs did that dog
have when you found him?

68
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,885
Three! That's what
makes him the best.

69
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,771
He can do more with three legs
than most dogs can do with four.

70
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,940
Except for digging.
He's really bad at digging.

71
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,108
And you remember what you said

72
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,443
about making decisions in the house?

73
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:16,496
You want to be involved.
We get that, so...

74
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,897
You just say the word,

75
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,699
and Champion goes back to the pound,

76
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,868
where he can be put down
and killed forever.

77
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,253
I'm not gonna send
a three-legged dog to his death.

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,605
Yes!

79
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,540
But I'm not gonna
take care of him for you.

80
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,093
Well, it would be nice
if you helped a little.

81
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,578
Because, unlike you,
Andy and I have jobs.

82
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:35,448
Cruel, but fair.

83
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,851
So Leslie and I have
come up with the theme

84
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,054
for the campaign relaunch rally.

85
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,855
"The Comeback Kid."

86
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,308
Everyone loves
a good comeback story. Rocky.

87
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,609
Robert Downey, Jr.

88
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,612
Terminator said,
"I'll be back," and he was.

89
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,865
Also making a comeback...
the casual Hawaiian shirt.

90
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,151
Well, well, well,
look, who's ahead of the curve.

91
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,452
I was joking.

92
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,955
You should soak that
in bleach and burn it.

93
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,790
Okay, so, the rally's
going to be held tomorrow

94
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,375
at the Pawnee Sports Building.

95
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,494
April, you finalized a rental, right?

96
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,912
Shut up, Ann.

97
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,680
I told you never to talk to me.

98
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,332
That was Champion.

99
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,050
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Bad dog!

100
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,719
Yes, everything's fine
with the rental.

101
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,353
Ron, you're constructing the stage?

102
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,838
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:20,226
Leslie wanted to hire
a contractor to build a stage.

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,961
I don't want to paint
with a broad brush here,

105
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,964
but every single contractor
in the world

106
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,000
is a miserable, incompetent thief.

107
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:33,940
Seal the edges by crimping
the fork... aw, crap.

108
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,374
Ed!

109
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,776
What's up, Chris?
Come on in, man.

110
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,311
I already did.

111
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,946
So, uh, how you been?
How are you doing?

112
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,748
- How are you?
- Great, actually.

113
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:46,052
I'm just learning how to
make a "cali-zoin-za."

114
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,222
Or, as you Americans
like to say, calzones.

115
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:53,126
- Do you want one?
- No, I find calzone fatty,

116
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,494
and unnecessary.

117
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,429
So, you've hit a bit of a rough patch,

118
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,164
and I care about you,

119
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,700
so I just want to make sure
you're doing okay.

120
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,669
Chris, honestly, I'm great.

121
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,473
I'm just exploring whatever fun
activity pops into my brain.

122
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,808
Like, check this out.

123
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:13,596
I'm teaching myself how to do
Claymation videos.

124
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,815
Isn't this just so cool?

125
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:17,116
It is so cool!

126
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,787
Ben is massively depressed,
and he needs my help.

127
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,555
You look like a real campaign manager.

128
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,724
Oh, thanks, that's because
I googled "campaign manager"

129
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,327
and noticed that they wear
a lot of dark colors.

130
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,762
See, there's more things
to look at on the Internet

131
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,999
- besides naked guys, Ann.
- What?

132
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,301
I need a team update,
campaign manager.

133
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,071
Okay. Pistol Pete Disellio
will be here in five minutes.

134
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,606
I still can't believe
that you got him.

135
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,075
Ann got local hero Pistol
Pete Disellio

136
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,777
to endorse me at the rally.

137
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,380
In 1992, Pistol Pete's
last-second dunk

138
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,466
against Eagleton High clinched
a comeback victory

139
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,985
for the Pawnee Central
drunken savages.

140
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,488
Team mascot later changed.

141
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,757
Akash, buddy, of course
I came to you first.

142
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,560
You're the best carpet man in Pawnee.

143
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,028
But here's my question...

144
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,063
Do your carpets match your drapes?

145
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,284
How do you make any event classy
on a budget?

146
00:06:08,318 --> 00:06:09,969
Red carpet.

147
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,737
My entire apartment is red carpet.

148
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,407
On top of that,
leading into my bedroom,

149
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,708
a second red carpet.

150
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,045
Oh, what's this in my shoe?

151
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,630
Red carpet insole.

152
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:24,350
Everywhere I go,
I'm walking on red carpet.

153
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,987
Is there even enough room
for everyone?

154
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,672
- Here, sit on my lap.
- No, that's humiliating.

155
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,123
Can't I at least sit on Andy's lap?

156
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,842
No, that's Champion's spot.
He called it.

157
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,727
Tom, we're already late.

158
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,896
Now, be a man, and sit
on that girl's lap.

159
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,098
Yes, sir.

160
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,336
Hi, Pete Disellio.

161
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,520
We can call you Pistol, right?

162
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,855
I prefer Pete.

163
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,140
Oh. Okay, got it.
I'm Leslie Knope.

164
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,042
We overlapped a year
at Pawnee Central.

165
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,244
You probably remember my voice

166
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,445
from the morning announcements.

167
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,280
This is my campaign manager,
Ann Perkins.

168
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,165
Hi, nice to meet you.
Come on in.

169
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,050
Oh, thanks.

170
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,953
- I'm excited to be here.
- Ah! We're excited to have you.

171
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:04,507
Ann is killing it.
My campaign team is unstoppable.

172
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,876
This rally is going to be awesome.

173
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,678
Oh, my God, I'm feeling it!

174
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:13,382
I'm gonna break dance!

175
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,500
Leslie?

176
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,519
Coming! Thank God.

177
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:25,833
Oh, Champion is a way better
kisser than you are, babe.

178
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:27,168
- Nuh-uh!
- Yes, he is.

179
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:29,959
He's even a better kisser
than me. Here, try some.

180
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,290
Okay, stop it.
He's drooling on me!

181
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:33,758
Oh!

182
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,927
- This is unsafe.
- Ha ha!

183
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,095
Oh, we should do it for the kids.

184
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,846
Kids love it, Ron.
Just for the kids.

185
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:42,634
Hi, kids! Hey!

186
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:44,018
Oh, look.

187
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:46,054
The police even love it.
They're sirening back to us.

188
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:47,889
That's awesome, I was
going to tell them that we...

189
00:07:47,923 --> 00:07:51,526
Heard ya, bud!

190
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,646
And then, you come out,
and you dunk the ball,

191
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:58,032
and you say, "Voting for Leslie
Knope is a slam dunk!"

192
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,167
You can still dunk, right?

193
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:03,037
- Oh, I can, but I won't.
- Sorry?

194
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:04,238
Look, everywhere I go,

195
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,773
everybody wants me to
talk about that dunk,

196
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:06,941
and that game.

197
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,209
It feels like I'm living in the past.

198
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:12,130
But the past is great.
The jitterbug, stagecoaches,

199
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:13,314
Herman Munster.

200
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,882
Look, Leslie, I read up on you.

201
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,484
You've done great stuff
for our parks system

202
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:18,686
and I will happily endorse you...

203
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:20,321
As Peter Disellio,

204
00:08:20,356 --> 00:08:22,056
regional distributor
for Derwin ham loafs,

205
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:25,560
but if this is about who I was,
or what I did when I was 17,

206
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,362
I'm out of here.

207
00:08:27,396 --> 00:08:29,147
Let's not talk about dunking anymore.

208
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,297
Let's talk about what you want to do.

209
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:32,066
- Okay.
- I think you want to dunk.

210
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,534
I'm not going to dunk the ball.

211
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,737
What about a layup?

212
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:38,156
Officer, I've been operating
heavy machinery

213
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,575
since I was eight years old.

214
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:43,528
Now, I respect you
and your service to this town

215
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:44,712
and your country,

216
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:48,416
but what laws are we breaking exactly?

217
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,351
Well, you got four people
in the front seat,

218
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:52,186
nobody's wearing a seat belt,

219
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,705
you were speeding
and blasting your horn

220
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,189
through the hospital zone,

221
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:58,376
the rear of the vehicle's open,
debris has been falling out,

222
00:08:58,427 --> 00:09:00,561
and you don't have a commercial
license to drive a truck.

223
00:09:00,596 --> 00:09:04,132
Okay. Well, we have
a philosophical difference

224
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,384
on what constitutes a law.

225
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:07,668
I need to see your hands

226
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:09,837
and could you step out of
the vehicle, please?

227
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:13,358
Hi. I just wanted you to know
we're about to be arrested.

228
00:09:13,392 --> 00:09:14,909
Oh my God, April, that's horrible.

229
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:16,561
Where are you?

230
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:18,363
"My mother's butt," really?
That's really helpful.

231
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:19,781
Let me talk to her.

232
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,617
April, this is city council
candidate Leslie Knope.

233
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,018
Do not make any trouble.

234
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:27,205
Sit tight.
I'm on my way.

235
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,040
- Whoa. You just hung up on her?
- She'd already hung up on me.

236
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:30,892
Okay, I'm going to go down
there and get them out,

237
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,427
because men in uniform love me.

238
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:35,063
You have to get Pistol Pete
to make that shot.

239
00:09:35,097 --> 00:09:36,831
Okay, but if I don't,
it's no big deal, right?

240
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:39,167
- You'll just make your speech?
- He's our surprise headliner.

241
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,202
The whole town loves him.
I'm polling at 1%.

242
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:43,054
He must dunk, Ann.

243
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:44,756
Do whatever it takes.

244
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,373
You know, anything short
of sexual favors.

245
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:47,842
- What?
- I do not...

246
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,477
I repeat, I do not

247
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:51,446
want you to tempt him
with sexual favors.

248
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,947
- I wasn't going to.
- Good, I wouldn't either.

249
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:54,315
That's where I draw the line.

250
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:55,550
Although, I am a little offended

251
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:56,567
that you wouldn't do that for me.

252
00:09:56,602 --> 00:09:58,102
- Go.
- Right.

253
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:02,356
- So, Ben... Why Calzone?
- Glad you asked, Chris.

254
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,725
You know, there's fast food
hamburgers.

255
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:05,893
There's fast food Mexican.

256
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,394
There's fast food Chinese.
Blah blah blah.

257
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:08,830
Have you ever wondered

258
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:11,165
why there isn't a fast food
option for Italian food?

259
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,533
What about pizza?

260
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:15,069
Pizza?
Never heard of it.

261
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,838
That's what people will be
saying in 20 years,

262
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:19,240
because pizza is old news, Chris.

263
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:22,126
Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.

264
00:10:22,177 --> 00:10:23,628
Never thought of it that way.

265
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,430
What I'm talking about is
a portable, delicious meal,

266
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:26,848
that is it's own container.

267
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:29,984
It's a whole new spin
on Italian fast casual dining.

268
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,853
Amazing.

269
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:34,222
And you of all people will like this.

270
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:35,223
I'm gonna use
low-fat ingredients.

271
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:36,524
Game-changer.

272
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:39,560
And I will call my new
Italian fast casual eatery

273
00:10:39,594 --> 00:10:44,148
"The Low-cal Calzone Zone."

274
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,235
That idea is literally
the greatest idea

275
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:48,302
I've ever heard in my life.

276
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:50,471
That idea is terrible.

277
00:10:50,506 --> 00:10:52,273
Glen, you're killing me.

278
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,408
They broke about 50 laws, Knope.

279
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:57,078
And that girl, she tried to get
that gimp dog to bite me.

280
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,447
Look, I could sit here
and fill out all the paperwork,

281
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,950
but you and I both know that
you'd rather go home to Debra,

282
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:05,619
have a nice home-cooked meal,
and do what comes naturally.

283
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:06,921
That's not appropriate.

284
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,090
You know that I'm gonna
pay all the fines.

285
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:13,344
I'm in the middle of a campaign
rally, and this is my team.

286
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,346
- I need them, please.
- Fine.

287
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:17,198
But unless one of you
has a commercial license,

288
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:20,134
you can't take that truck.

289
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:23,020
It would just mean so much to us.

290
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:25,106
I mean, you're a living legend.

291
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,209
They still air that game every
Friday night on cable access.

292
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:29,544
Yeah, well, being a living legend is

293
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:30,995
sort of a double-edged sword.

294
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,880
Everybody in this town
still calls me "Pistol."

295
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:35,867
Tell me more about that, Peter.

296
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:39,203
I mean, yes, that dunk,
it made me famous,

297
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:42,623
but sometimes...

298
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:46,594
Sometimes life dunks you.

299
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:48,662
Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?

300
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,464
Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs,

301
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:52,350
get some endorphins going?

302
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:54,018
Oh, no, thanks, Chris.

303
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:56,070
Kind of tearing this Claymation video

304
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:57,838
a new one right now.

305
00:11:57,873 --> 00:11:59,473
You know, Ben, I really think

306
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:00,892
you need to take a step back here.

307
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:02,843
I think getting some
perspective would be good.

308
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,378
What are you talking about?

309
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:05,780
I've known you a long time.

310
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:10,184
And, right now, you need help.

311
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:13,020
- With my Claymaish?
- With your life.

312
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:17,291
You are wildly, insanely depressed.

313
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,726
Depressed?

314
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,461
I'm the furthest thing from depressed.

315
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:22,363
I mean, look at what
I've accomplished.

316
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:24,248
Do you see him?

317
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:26,250
Do you think a depressed
person could make this?

318
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:29,754
No.

319
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:32,039
- That's all we can fit in here.
- No problem.

320
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:33,975
This is going to be fine.
We're all going to be fine,

321
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:35,376
because the team is still together,

322
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:37,144
and there's nothing the team can't do.

323
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,481
Wait, I think Champion
has to go to the bathroom.

324
00:12:40,515 --> 00:12:44,085
- Oh! He shall do it in the car!
- Answer your phone, Ann.

325
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,586
That's what life is like

326
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,755
in a strict Roman Catholic household.

327
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:49,357
Of course, my father,

328
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,441
he was more stick than carrot

329
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:52,159
when it came to matters of discipline.

330
00:12:52,194 --> 00:12:55,363
I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt
that I know,

331
00:12:55,397 --> 00:12:57,965
I just don't think he'd be
happy sitting here

332
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,584
faffing around.

333
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:00,918
I'm not faffing around.

334
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:02,753
I've sunk myself into my hobbies.

335
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:06,340
Here, I'll show you my
Claymation project, okay?

336
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,476
Now, I've been working
pretty hard on this,

337
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,178
and... I think
it's really good.

338
00:13:11,213 --> 00:13:13,514
So just hang on to your hat, okay?

339
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:15,433
Here it goes.

340
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:19,086
Oh, how great.

341
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:26,627
♪ Stand in the place
where you... ♪

342
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,535
- Did you pause it?
- No, I... hang on.

343
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,906
♪ Stand in the place
where you... ♪

344
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:48,215
Oh, my God.
That's the whole thing.

345
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,685
- That's three weeks of work.
- You're gonna be okay.

346
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,255
No, no, no, no, I'm not.
You see, in my head,

347
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,891
I thought that was really,
really cool.

348
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:59,493
I emailed Leslie two days ago

349
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,696
and I compared it to Avatar,

350
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,098
Chris, and how can it not be longer?

351
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,901
Okay, look, what you're
feeling, right now

352
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:09,570
is regret and shame.

353
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,774
Okay, no word from Ann.

354
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:15,326
April, I need a status report.

355
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,245
- How's it looking out there?
- Perfect, but just one thing.

356
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,847
It's not a basketball court any more.

357
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,198
It's an ice skating rink.

358
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,750
Wait, what? Why?
What happened?

359
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:24,919
The stupid guy I called to
book this place didn't tell me

360
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:26,954
they took off the basketball
floor for a hockey game.

361
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:29,290
Or maybe he did tell me,
but he was so stupid and boring

362
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:30,508
that I wasn't listening,

363
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:31,659
and either way, it was his fault,

364
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:33,461
because he was stupid and I hated him.

365
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:34,895
Ron, how's the stage coming?

366
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,632
Well, since we had to
jettison the bulk of the wood,

367
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,934
this is the biggest I could make it.

368
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:41,502
Oh, my God.

369
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:44,638
Good lord, what happened
to the rest of my face?

370
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:46,340
We had to "Jetsons"
most of the poster too,

371
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:47,558
but I kind of like it,

372
00:14:47,609 --> 00:14:51,112
'cause windows
are the eyes to the house.

373
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:52,780
Wow.

374
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:55,649
- Okay, I got Pistol Pete.
- Good, where is he?

375
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,651
Right now, he's curled up
in the back seat of my car,

376
00:14:57,685 --> 00:15:00,588
talking about his father,
who is a piece of work.

377
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:02,623
I actually think he did the best
he could for a single father,

378
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:04,325
but I may be too close
to the situation.

379
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,077
Anyway, the important news
is that he's here.

380
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:07,628
Good. Is he going to
dunk for me?

381
00:15:07,662 --> 00:15:09,997
I'm not sure, I couldn't
hear through all the crying.

382
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:11,698
- He's crying?
- No, I was crying.

383
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:12,967
It's been a stressful day,

384
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:14,168
and he's had a really rough life.

385
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:15,603
Oh, my God.

386
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:16,837
We should cancel it, right?
Maybe we should cancel it?

387
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,072
- Yeah.
- Jerry...

388
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:19,590
You were in charge of getting a crowd.

389
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:21,175
Please tell me that you pulled
a Jerry, and no one's here.

390
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,510
Okay, well, first of all,

391
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:23,978
I don't like it when you guys
use that term.

392
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:26,180
But for the record, I came through.

393
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:28,549
There are almost
a hundred people out there!

394
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:31,435
Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just
had to do your job, didn't you?

395
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,387
Yeah, can't you do anything
wrong, Jerry?

396
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:35,389
I've been looking
at our utter and complete lack

397
00:15:35,407 --> 00:15:37,742
of experience as a positive thing,

398
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:39,243
but I'm starting to think

399
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,061
it actually might be a problem.

400
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:45,794
Okay, guys, everybody listen up.

401
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:47,590
I just wanted to say thank you.

402
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,238
You've all volunteered
your time and, no matter what,

403
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:52,073
I am eternally grateful for it.

404
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:53,241
Now, I'm going to go out there,

405
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:55,076
and I'm going to
announce the relaunch,

406
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,678
and I'm going to muddle through
this thing as best I can.

407
00:15:57,713 --> 00:15:59,880
You should all leave,
and when this thing is over,

408
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,215
I'll meet you at the nearest bar.

409
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,184
That would be Hurley's.

410
00:16:03,218 --> 00:16:04,535
- Oh, it's karaoke tonight!
- Yes!

411
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,939
No, no, no, guys.
No. We're not leaving, okay?

412
00:16:07,973 --> 00:16:09,490
We're the reason
Leslie's in this mess.

413
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:12,393
It's our mess.
We're going to stay here

414
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:14,512
and we're going to
go out there as a team.

415
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:19,317
Or, we go as a team to Hurley's.

416
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:21,102
No, Ann's right.

417
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:24,372
We're a team.
We're all going out together.

418
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,539
Let's give this crowd a show.

419
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:28,159

00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:35,983

Tom?

423
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,340
Couldn't afford enough premium carpet

424
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:43,824
to get us to the stage.

425
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:44,959
I mean, it was a short walk,

426
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:46,627
but it was pretty luxurious, right?

427
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:48,662
Okay.

428
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,387
Everybody smile and wave.

Stop leaning on my arm, Andy.

432
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:15,823
I'm holding the dog.

433
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,908
He is peeing.
He is now peeing.

434
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,693
I am putting him down.

435
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:21,462
No, Ron, he only has three legs!

436
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:25,433
- Get off me!
- No, I'm scared!

438
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,904
Ron? Ron?
There's no stairs.

How do I get onto the stage?

440
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:34,408

Uhh! Uhh!

447
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:01,001

449

Mm-mm.
Here you go. Drink up,

450
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:10,077
because it has every herb
in my herb belt.

451
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:12,513
Oh. Tastes like a belt.

452
00:18:12,547 --> 00:18:15,716
I know, isn't it awful?
But it works wonderfully.

453
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,301
So, tell me.

454
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:19,987
Do you admit that you're depressed?

455
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:21,956
How did you know?
I didn't even know.

456
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,191
The Letters to Cleo t-shirt,
the unshaven face,

457
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:27,094
the Doc Martins, and your hair
does not have that normal,

458
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:30,931
uptight, rigid, inflexible
Ben Wyatt sense of fun.

459
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:34,468
You can't hide
these things from friends.

460
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:37,171
I think I'm feeling better.

461
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:39,707
Herbal smoothie,
you have done it again.

462
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:43,411
As a loyal pawneean, I've
always been proud of this town,

463
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:45,479
and, I, oh, um, sorry.

464
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:48,382
My cards got out of order here
when they fell.

465
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:55,055
Together, we can defeat
obese children.

466
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,175
I'm sure that was something
positive, originally.

467
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:01,729
I'm sorry, okay, this is
just a disaster, isn't it?

468
00:19:01,763 --> 00:19:06,801
This is the worst political
event ever in history.

469
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:11,138
Well, um, I can assure
you people in the bleachers

470
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:14,241
that, if you follow my campaign,
it will be interesting.

471
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:15,860
It sure will be!

472
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:17,445
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Pistol Pete,

473
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,813
and around here, I'm a Pawnee legend!

474
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:25,669
I just wanted to say that
I fully endorse Leslie Knope.

475
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:27,654
She's got a great team behind her,

476
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:30,858
and a vote for her is a slam dunk.

477
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:34,728
Thanks, Pistol Pete!

478
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:37,264
Wow, we're so happy to have you.

479
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,934
Oh, hey. There he goes.

480
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:40,935
Come on, Pete!

481
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,353
Oh!

482
00:19:42,387 --> 00:19:45,055
Okay, stay still.
Stay down.

483
00:19:45,106 --> 00:19:48,542
Pistol Pete, everybody.
Still got it.

484
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:54,014
- Hey.
- Hey, how was the rally?

485
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,916
- Oh, we nailed it!
- No, we didn't.

486
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:58,586
Ben, my campaign manager
and I have made a decision.

487
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,689
We've decided to fire
the campaign manager... me.

488
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:05,392
- And hire you.
- But we've talked about this.

489
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:07,828
I don't care if you're
poison to my campaign.

490
00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:11,532
This team has a lot of heart
and zero know-how.

491
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:13,300
You're the only one that can save us.

492
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:16,136
Please be my campaign manager.

493
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:18,572
You know, Leslie, Ben's really
been going through something,

494
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:21,575
and he's on a journey, so I
don't think he's gonna be...

495
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,244
I'll do it. I'm in.

496
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:25,813
I've done enough exploring.
I'm good.

497
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:27,214
- Okay, great.
- Ann, you're fired.

498
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:29,883
Oh, thank God.

499
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:33,164
No, don't make out.
It's making Champion sad.

Surprise!

502
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,296
We felt really bad about
the whole dredging up your past

503
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,632
just to be publically
humiliated thing.

504
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,635
- So, cookies.
- And balloons.

505
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,704
Thanks, guys. It...
that's nice.

506
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,972
We feel so bad.

507
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,441
Is there anything else we can do?

508
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:01,076
You could let me take you to dinner.

509
00:21:01,111 --> 00:21:02,945
Yes, Ann, yes.
You should do that.

510
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:04,980
Oh, I can't, though,
because I'm married.

511
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,600
You're not married.
She's not married.

512
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:11,820
This is uncomfortable.
