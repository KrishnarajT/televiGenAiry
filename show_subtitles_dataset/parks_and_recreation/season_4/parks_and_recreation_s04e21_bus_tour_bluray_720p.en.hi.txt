1
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:37,401
Okay, everybody.
Big, big news.

2
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:39,469
Uh, Leslie, would you like
to do the honors?

3
00:00:39,537 --> 00:00:40,904
No, I think
you should deliver the news.

4
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:42,405
Yeah,
but you're the candidate.

5
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:43,640
Yeah, but you're
the brilliant campaign manager.

6
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:44,808
- But you're the cutest.
- I love you.

7
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,509
I love you too.

8
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:49,645
Hey, were you going
to tell us something?

9
00:00:49,713 --> 00:00:50,947
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, right.

10
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,448
The latest poll has us

11
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:54,917
only two points
behind Bobby Newport!

12
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:56,318
- Whoo! Yes!
- Two points!

13
00:00:56,386 --> 00:00:57,653
I know, you guys,

14
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,355
we only have one more day
to close the gap,

15
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,625
and we're going to do so
in a one-time campaign blitz

16
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:04,525
aboard the S.S. Knope.

17
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:06,594
This is going to be our home
for the next 24 hours.

18
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:08,396
And if we win, hopefully,
it will be the home

19
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:10,398
- that Ben and I share forever.
- Uh, what?

20
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,699
It's just an idea I had.
We don't have to do it.

21
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:12,700
Whatever.
We can talk about it.

22
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:13,802
Okay, here we go!

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,103
We've come so far.

24
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:17,205
I want this so bad,
I can taste it.

25
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:19,406
When I close my eyes,

26
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:21,608
I can picture
the flash of the cameras

27
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:23,210
at my swearing in.

28
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:25,646
And I can hear
the sound of the applause

29
00:01:25,713 --> 00:01:27,514
when I take my oath.

30
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:29,850
And I can see
in the crowd

31
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:32,987
president Obama smiling at me.

32
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:34,921
He made it.

33
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:37,891
I didn't think he would come,
but he made it.

34
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,759
Hey, buddy.

00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:02,281
A few days ago,
on a routine campaign stop

37
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:03,615
in downtown Pawnee,

38
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:07,251
one Leslie Knope...
pause... was attacked...

39
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,954
play...
by a pie.

40
00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:12,489
Luckily, it only hit Jerry,
so no damage was done.

41
00:02:12,557 --> 00:02:13,858
Play.

42
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:16,393
The only evidence
we have is a video shot by...

43
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:20,031
pause... my wife,
April Ludgate.

44
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,967
This is Bert Macklin's
greatest assignment yet.

45
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,169
If you are watching,
perpetrator,

46
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:30,673
just know that
you are still at large.

47
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:32,042
Okay, listen up, folks.

48
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,844
We have
a security situation here.

49
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,612
As you know,
when we reach the location,

50
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,148
I will be conducting
a security sweep.

51
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:41,350
Also, from now on,
we'll be using code names.

52
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,552
You can address me
as "eagle one."

53
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:46,021
Ann, code name:
"Been there, done that."

54
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:48,123
April is
"currently doing that."

55
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,559
Donna is
"it happened once in a dream."

56
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:52,627
Chris, code name:
"If I had to pick a dude."

57
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:55,463
Ben is "eagle two."

58
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,065
Oh, thank God.

59
00:02:57,532 --> 00:02:59,567
No, please.
Come...

60
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,102
we have a problem.

61
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,270
The vans we rented to take

62
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:03,938
senior citizens
to the polls tomorrow

63
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:05,907
are now, quote,
"no longer available."

64
00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:07,308
What?

65
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:08,843
I thought we locked those vans
down, like, a week ago.

66
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,478
Yeah, we worked really hard
to get those seniors back

67
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,079
on our side
after that ramp debacle.

68
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:13,881
- I really need their votes.
- Okay.

69
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:15,749
Tom, go down there
and get those vans back.

70
00:03:15,816 --> 00:03:18,352
I'll use
my legendary Haverford charm.

71
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,354
I have total faith in you.

72
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:22,155
Take Donna with you.
Ron, you go too.

73
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:23,723
April,
you are a very intelligent

74
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,192
and savvy young woman.

75
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,459
I do not just think of you
as just a gofer,

76
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:28,060
but right now,
I need you to get me

77
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,595
a triple espresso
with eight sugars.

78
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:31,030
Okay.

79
00:03:31,098 --> 00:03:33,299
Wha... I'm on it.
I'll go. I'm going.

80
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,833
Please, I can go.
I don't mind.

81
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:36,168
It's better than
listening to her

82
00:03:36,236 --> 00:03:37,370
stump speech
for a millionth time.

83
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:40,206
No. I will do it.
I have to do it.

84
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:42,108
I need to do it.
Good-bye.

85
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:44,575
This has been a difficult
year for me, romantically.

86
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:48,914
Millicent Gergich,
Ann Perkins, Andy's professor...

87
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,448
lots of disappointment,

88
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,884
but if I keep
my body moving

89
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,819
and my mind occupied
at all times,

90
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:59,390
I will avoid falling into
a bottomless pit of despair.

91
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,858
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

92
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:04,861
the next city councilor
of the great city of Pawnee,

93
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,230
Leslie Knope!

94
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,433
This is "eagle one,"
"been there, done that"

95
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,901
is leaving the stage.

96
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:13,270
"I'd be lying if I said
I hadn't thought about it"

97
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,172
is in position.

98
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,242
What do we want for our city?
I'll tell you what I want.

99
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,278
I want better schools,
I want cleaner streets,

100
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,347
I want to expel
the violent gangs

101
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:27,116
of geese in Detweiler Square.

102
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:31,286
And I will finally eliminate
this city's libraries!

103
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,721
Thank you.

104
00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:35,690
In the last few weeks,
we've turned this campaign

105
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:37,559
into a well-oiled machine.

106
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:40,795
Leslie's stump speech
is 10 minutes and 40 seconds

107
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,896
every time.

108
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,398
Here, check this out.

109
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:47,801
There will be a big laugh
right... now.

110
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:54,108
And now,
a two-second awkward silence

111
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,977
after Leslie does her
Rodney Dangerfield impression.

112
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:57,211
I tell ya,

113
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,179
these geese
don't give me no respect.

114
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:01,282
No respect at all.

115
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,483
She insists on trying it
every time,

116
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,385
and it never works.

117
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:08,121
But the rest of the speech,
fantastic.

118
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:10,123
When I was building parks,
helping the community,

119
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:12,725
and putting together
the harvest festival,

120
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,060
where was Bobby?

121
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:16,029
He and his father,
Nick Newport

122
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,698
were exploiting this city
for their personal gain.

123
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:20,632
You deserve more.

124
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:22,801
Here's the best part.

125
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,336
Watch what happens
when she says...

126
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:28,140
Together,
we can build a better Pawnee.

127
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:30,809
♪ Get on your feet ♪

128
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:34,246
Everybody says
they care about the issues,

129
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:36,314
but at the end of the day,

130
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:38,549
all anyone really wants
is free clothing

131
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,019
shot at them from a cannon.

132
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:46,024
I've been staring
at this board for days.

133
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,525
I'm so close
to putting it together.

134
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,394
There's got to be
something we missed.

135
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:51,594
Let's go over this again.

136
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:56,366
The video shows that
the pie came from a high angle,

137
00:05:56,434 --> 00:06:00,670
so it would've hit your face...
like this.

138
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:01,938
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:04,874
Don't close your eyes.

140
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,176
Uh...

141
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:13,649
No, no.
It was actually from up higher.

142
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:14,850
Is that about right?

143
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:16,752
- Yeah.
- Good.

144
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:19,255
Clean yourself up.
Let's do this again.

145
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:21,157
Hey, Bill!

146
00:06:21,224 --> 00:06:23,025
Tom Haverford
from the Knope campaign.

147
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,427
And you brought
the whole posse with you, huh?

148
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,795
I'm not changing my mind.

149
00:06:27,863 --> 00:06:29,431
We already paid
for those vans, Mr. Butler.

150
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:31,599
$900 for one day.

151
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,202
Yeah, it was $900,
but now it's $10,000.

152
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,437
Excuse me?

153
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:37,405
The Newport campaign
offered me 10 grand

154
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:39,406
to just rent the vans
and park them somewhere.

155
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,175
So I'm going to tear up
your contract,

156
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,176
and I'm going to take the money.

157
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:43,210
Anything else?

158
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,345
No? Great.

159
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:46,447
Well, what now?

160
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:47,881
He's just playing hardball.

161
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,016
Let me tell you
how it's gonna go down.

162
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,552
In a few minutes,
we'll walk in there,

163
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,620
we'll give him our demands,
and then, bam!

164
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:55,721
I start crying.

165
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:57,623
We need the vans, so please,

166
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:59,358
give the vans, please?

167
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:01,227
We need the vans.

168
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,530
And if elected,
I promise to stop the Newports

169
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:07,800
and Sweetums from
blatantly dumping contaminants

170
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,034
into the Pawnee river.

171
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:14,707
Leslie, can you comment
on Bobby's father Nick Newport?

172
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:17,610
Nick Newport has been
intimidating and bullying

173
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:19,344
and poisoning
this town for years.

174
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:21,480
Frankly, he's a real jerk,

175
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,015
and if he thinks he can buy
this election for his son,

176
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,216
he's wrong.

177
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,517
Sorry, I meant
can you comment on

178
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:28,720
Nick Newport
dying earlier today?

179
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:32,023
He died?

180
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:34,391
I...

181
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:35,559
Sad.

182
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:36,861
Is that
your official statement?

183
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:37,996
"I sad"?

184
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:41,666
No, my official statement is

185
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:44,334
that is overall,

186
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,335
a bummer.

187
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:46,737
Oof.

188
00:07:46,804 --> 00:07:50,007
And... and together
we can build a better Pawnee.

189
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:53,876
♪ Get on your feet ♪
- No, this is isn't the time.

190
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,112
No, guys.
♪ Get up and make it happen ♪

191
00:07:58,261 --> 00:07:59,729
Frankly, he's a real jerk.

192
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:03,532
Harsh words, but this reporter
does love those t-shirt cannons.

193
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,967
Now, Jen, what are
your thoughts about all of this?

194
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:07,603
This is not a time
for politics.

195
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,638
I am calling on Leslie Knope
to cancel

196
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:12,340
all of her campaign events

197
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,308
out of respect
for the Newport family.

198
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,777
Anything else would
be a classless move,

199
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:22,516
on par with spray-painting
nipples on the Lincoln memorial.

200
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,035
Okay, emergency meeting.

201
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:26,170
I need everyone
to gather around me

202
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:27,638
in order of
how much I trust them.

203
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,942
Here's the situation.
A man has died.

204
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,045
But that man is 98 years old,
and he's an awful man.

205
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:36,613
However, he is a man,
and he died.

206
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,748
Also, you called
the dead man a jerk.

207
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,216
However,
he was a jerk.

208
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:41,651
He put a lot of people
out of work,

209
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,587
he had tons of mistresses,

210
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,187
he polluted this town.

211
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:46,722
Okay, Ben, what do we do?

212
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,091
Okay, it's unfortunate,
but the stakes are too high.

213
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:52,661
We can't just stop campaigning.
We stop, we lose.

214
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,396
Good answer, great body.

215
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:55,330
Ann, try to beat
what he said.

216
00:08:55,398 --> 00:08:56,865
I'm not going to beat him.

217
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,400
Not with that attitude.

218
00:08:58,468 --> 00:08:59,902
Okay, fine.
I think you should stop.

219
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,636
At least until you apologize
to Bobby in person.

220
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:03,204
April?

221
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,439
I wasn't listening, but
I strongly disagree with Ann.

222
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:06,608
Andy?

223
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:09,677
If the... if the guy... if...

224
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:11,178
Okay.

225
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:12,880
I absolutely think that
we should keep campaigning.

226
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:14,983
The worst possible thing
we could do would be to stop,

227
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,450
'cause if the campaign stops,
we all stop.

228
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:19,552
And stopping is certain death.
Who wants a panini?

229
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,553
Anyone? Everyone?

230
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:21,722
I'm going to say everyone.

231
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:23,289
All right.

232
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:24,658
All right, Leslie,
what's your call?

233
00:09:24,726 --> 00:09:28,061
Ann, there is nothing harder
in the entire world

234
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:29,796
than saying no
to your beautiful face.

235
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,031
But I'm going to.

236
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,565
No! We're going
to keep campaigning.

237
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,399
Okay, but we're going to do it
in a classy and respectful way

238
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:35,501
to get Ann off of our backs.

239
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:37,036
What's next on the "schedge?"

240
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:39,038
If you let Newport
have the vans,

241
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:40,572
they just sit there in a lot.

242
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,743
If you let us have the vans,
they drive around town all day.

243
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,679
Free publicity.
Everyone will see your logo.

244
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:50,214
Which is you all pressed
up on some chick with huge cans.

245
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:51,883
Yeah.
It was a hell of a day.

246
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,384
People need to know about it.

247
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,453
And I don't need free publicity.

248
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:58,857
I can just pay for it.
With my $10,000.

249
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:01,126
Look, I ain't gonna try
to play a player.

250
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:02,027
You're trying
to get beaucoup bucks

251
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:03,028
just like the rest of us.

252
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,395
So how about this?

253
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:07,297
I have a business idea
for a gourmet alcoholic yogurt.

254
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:09,499
I call it...
Yogurt platinum.

255
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,968
I'll let you in
on the ground floor.

256
00:10:11,036 --> 00:10:12,670
And let me tell you,
it's going to be

257
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,371
worth way more
than 10 grand.

258
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:16,173
Yeah, but now that
I know your bad idea,

259
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,144
I can start the company myself.
With my $10,000.

260
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:22,211
No, you can't do that!
Ron!

261
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,981
Tom, Donna, could
you please give us a moment?

262
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:27,449
I'd like to talk to Bill,
man to man.

263
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:29,318
He's gonna steal
yogurt platinum.

264
00:10:29,386 --> 00:10:30,820
No, I'm not.

265
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:32,738
"We're all your friends,"
said Mr. bacon.

266
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:36,008
"Welcome home."
The end.

267
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:38,443
And that is
Groffle, the awful Waffle,

268
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,345
a book that
I wrote and published

269
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,680
on behalf
of my education initiative.

270
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:43,914
Any questions?

271
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:44,916
Yes?

272
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:47,685
How did Groffle cross
the syrup river?

273
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:49,988
And why did you call
Mr. Newport a jerk?

274
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:54,124
Ah... well, I should not have
called Nick Newport a jerk,

275
00:10:54,192 --> 00:10:56,893
because we need to be respectful
of all dead people.

276
00:10:56,962 --> 00:11:00,130
I mean, not Stalin or Hitler,
but...

277
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:01,966
I'm not calling
Nick Newport Hitler.

278
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:03,468
Ms. Knope, I have a follow-up

279
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:05,736
to what I'm now deciding
to call "jerk-gate."

280
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:07,805
Are there any other
deceased members

281
00:11:07,873 --> 00:11:09,973
of Bobby Newport's family
you'd like to attack?

282
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,608
And quit ducking
the waffle question.

283
00:11:11,676 --> 00:11:13,543
Did Groffle use
a boat of some kind?

284
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,611
All right, that's all
the questions for now.

285
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,012
Thank you, everybody.

286
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,231
Are we to assume that he swam
across the syrup river?

287
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:19,232
Ms. Knope!

288
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:20,533
I'm never going to get away

289
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,735
from these Nick Newport
questions.

290
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,537
It's obvious
what you need to do.

291
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,589
You have to apologize
to Bobby and stop campaigning.

292
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:29,324
Okay, fine.

293
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,694
We go to Bobby Newport,
you apologize...

294
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,328
Good.

295
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:34,697
And then we leak
the details to the press,

296
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:37,432
which restores your reputation
and buys us enough time

297
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,201
- to finish the bus tour.
- Nice.

298
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:40,869
No, that's not a real apology.

299
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,570
It's just sneaky.
I don't like it.

300
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:44,672
Ann, for once,
this is not about you.

301
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,542
A man is dead.

302
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,694
Look, friend,
I respect your slavish devotion

303
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:52,029
to the free market,

304
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:54,198
but you can't welch
on a contract.

305
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:58,735
Where I come from,
a man's word is sacred.

306
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:01,104
Okay, what's your stance
on pinky swears,

307
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:03,039
George Washington?

308
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:04,741
I'm taking the money.

309
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,728
Fine.
I'll match it.

310
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,296
I'll give you
$10,000 for the vans.

311
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:11,731
Deal?

312
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,798
No. Price has gone up.

313
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:14,933
Now it's $12,000.

314
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,001
What? Why?

315
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,236
Look,

316
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,604
I own a fleet
of 22 crappy white vans,

317
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,140
and for some reason
there's a massive bidding war

318
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,674
going on over them.

319
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,178
Now for a guy whose only assets
are 22 crappy white vans,

320
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,779
it's pretty much
a dream scenario,

321
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,813
so I'm just going
to ride this out,

322
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,949
see where it takes me.

323
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,884
And now it's 15,000.

324
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:36,887
Okay, I talked Newport's
people into giving us

325
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,856
ten minutes alone with Bobby,

326
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,458
so we get in there,
we apologize,

327
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:42,093
and then we get back
on the campaign trail.

328
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,894
Okay, how do we leak this
to the press?

329
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:44,929
Do we, like, release
a statement?

330
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:46,296
Do we call somebody?

331
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:49,199
Um, I don't think that's going
to be a problem.

332
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:52,169
Oh, my God, why are
there so many people here?

333
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:54,704
It's a trap.
It's a trap!

334
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:56,073
We got to get out of here.
Turn around! Turn around!

335
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,442
This is a time of solemnity
and remembrance.

336
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:02,478
This is not a time
for politi...

337
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:05,047
Oh, wow.

338
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:08,650
Leslie Knope is
driving her campaign bus

339
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,086
through a memorial service.

340
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:11,520
- Back it up!
- Back it up!

341
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:12,921
- Okay, back up!
- Back it up!

342
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:14,923
Just when we thought
she couldn't stoop any lower.

343
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:16,725
Just... oh!

344
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:19,660
- Oh!
- Aah!

345
00:13:19,728 --> 00:13:21,196
- Uh...
- Go forward!

346
00:13:21,263 --> 00:13:22,964
Go forward!
Go forward!

347
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:25,133
I feel like
he's dying all over again.

348
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:27,102
- Stop it!
- Ah!

349
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:30,238
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

350
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:40,046
Hi...
Sorry, are we late?

351
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:46,087
So I... I hate
to bring this up again,

352
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:48,089
but I just want to make sure
that I'm going to get paid.

353
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:50,224
It was a handshake agreement
with Mr. Newport.

354
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,459
It was for a lot of money.

355
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:53,027
Anyway,
you can wire-transfer it.

356
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:54,395
Sorry for your loss.

357
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:55,529
I can't believe
you turned this situation

358
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:57,164
into a political sideshow.

359
00:13:57,232 --> 00:13:58,632
Oh, come on,
you guys were only going

360
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,633
to apologize for the press.

361
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:02,035
No way, that's not us.
You don't know us at all.

362
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:03,069
It's rude to say it.

363
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:04,304
We wouldn't even think it.

364
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:05,806
Yeah,
that's a ridiculous claim.

365
00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:09,543
We brought a "sorry
for your loss" fruit basket

366
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:10,777
for Bobby.

367
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:13,814
And it is very classy.
No melon, no apples.

368
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:15,482
You were going to use us,

369
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:17,282
and we just turned
the tables on you.

370
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,918
'Cause I'm smarter and faster.

371
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:20,953
That is not a judgment.
That's just a fact.

372
00:14:21,021 --> 00:14:23,923
We're both just doing whatever
it takes to win, right?

373
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:27,226
I love polka dots.
It's so cute.

374
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:30,029
I'm sorry,
I should have seen this coming.

375
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:32,096
And we should not
have driven here

376
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,732
on a bus
with your face on it.

377
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,033
No, it's my fault.

378
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,934
And you know what?
Jen is right.

379
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:37,101
I'm no better than her.

380
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,837
No, Leslie,
yes, you are.

381
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:42,273
All you need to do is
stop the machine for a second

382
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,075
and go apologize to Bobby.

383
00:14:44,143 --> 00:14:46,610
Alone without cameras.

384
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,079
Thanks, Ann, but where was
that advice six hours ago?

385
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,547
That's not going to work.

386
00:14:50,614 --> 00:14:52,149
I had to try.

387
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,421
April.

388
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,289
I just got Champion
his dog food,

389
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,191
cleaned your house,
filed that paperwork...

390
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:03,293
you're officially
April Ludgate Dwyer,

391
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,494
installed a smoke detector,
and now I'm back.

392
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:06,595
What's next?

393
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:07,829
Nothing, Chris.

394
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:10,232
Just sit down somewhere
and stop bothering me.

395
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,367
I can't.

396
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:14,070
I've had a very tough year.

397
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:17,940
I can't stop thinking about
Ann and Millicent.

398
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:19,508
And if I'm alone
with my thoughts,

399
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:21,476
I go to a dark place.

400
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:23,711
Okay, first of all,
dark places are awesome.

401
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,115
Secondly, Ann is kind of lame,
so way to dodge a bullet.

402
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:30,385
And Millicent is Jerry's
daughter, so two bullets.

403
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:34,855
And you're not alone.
You've got... lots of friends.

404
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:37,057
Somewhere.

405
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,992
I assume.

406
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,228
You're going to be just fine.

407
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:44,831
Thank you.
You're right.

408
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,933
I'll be fine.

409
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:48,735
I'm not fine.
It didn't work.

410
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,142
Hey, Bobby.

411
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,945
Oh, hi.

412
00:16:00,013 --> 00:16:01,346
Want to play bowling?

413
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:03,749
Why don't you play
with the real one?

414
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:07,253
Oh.
I like this one better.

415
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:09,854
The little guy looks like me.
See?

416
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:12,090
Hey, can we talk
for a second?

417
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:15,293
Look, I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry your dad died,

418
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,795
and I'm really, really sorry
I called him a jerk.

419
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:20,098
That's okay.

420
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,967
He was, like,
a million years old.

421
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:25,436
And he was kind of a jerk.

422
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:28,172
The only reason I did this
campaign was to impress him,

423
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,508
and he couldn't have cared less.

424
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:34,978
You know, my mom was a great
athlete when she was a kid.

425
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:38,215
So in junior high,
I joined the track team

426
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,551
to impress her,
even though I hated it.

427
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:43,085
And at the end of the year,

428
00:16:43,154 --> 00:16:47,290
I ran the 5,000 meters
in this huge track event.

429
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:51,394
And I finished dead last.

430
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,996
And I thought that she was going
to be really disappointed in me.

431
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:55,532
But she wasn't.

432
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:59,334
She ran up to me, and she
wrapped me up in this big hug,

433
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:02,538
and she told me she had never
been more proud of me.

434
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:06,542
Thanks, Leslie.
That's a great story.

435
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,612
I'm not 100% sure
I get the point, but...

436
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,780
You finished this race,
Bobby.

437
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:15,483
The campaign is over,
and you finished.

438
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,718
Win or lose,

439
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:22,890
I bet you anything that
your dad was proud of you.

440
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,091
Now I get it.

441
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:25,393
There you go.

442
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,362
Your mom and my dad
are both dicks.

443
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,431
There's no vans
within 50 miles,

444
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,133
and, for some reason,

445
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,302
no one wants
to lend me $10,000.

446
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,070
Even if we had the dough,

447
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:40,006
that bunco artist would just
demand more, trust me.

448
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,243
Don't move.
Let's just stay here.

449
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,976
For like an hour,
and not let him out.

450
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:47,346
This isn't right.
Our girl's worked hard.

451
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:48,914
We're so close.

452
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:53,519
I know he didn't
just hit my baby!

453
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:55,321
Hey!
What the hell, guys?

454
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:56,622
Move!

455
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,823
All right.

456
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,625
Y'all got your seat belts on?

457
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,393
Oh!

458
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,296
Did you see that?

459
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:08,266
That son of a bitch
just rear-ended me.

460
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:09,534
Am I dead?

461
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:10,602
What the hell?

462
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:14,004
Exactly, Bill.
What the hell?

463
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:15,306
You just rear-ended me.

464
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:16,673
That is not what happened.

465
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:18,609
- But I got witnesses.
- Yeah.

466
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,577
It went down exactly the way
my girl said it did,

467
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:22,078
you mean, bald man.

468
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,882
Hey, what about you,
Mr. "A man's word is sacred"?

469
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,052
Well, it is,
but you're an ass[Bleep].

470
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,454
So we can settle this now.

471
00:18:30,521 --> 00:18:34,089
I will accept payment
in van rentals.

472
00:18:34,757 --> 00:18:36,125
Gah!

473
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:37,893
All right,
let's go to the video again.

474
00:18:38,261 --> 00:18:40,996
Sweet kick,
Leslie exits the building,

475
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:42,798
and then you get hit.

476
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:48,603
What else do we know?

477
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,274
We know that Leslie was
about 15 feet in front of you,

478
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,976
so clearly the assailant
has terrible aim.

479
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:55,943
Mm-hmm.

480
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,514
Or...

481
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,316
Leslie wasn't the target.

482
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:03,252
Well, who then?

483
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,820
Okay, that's permanent marker.

484
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:08,722
Go find Ben,

485
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,357
get a list of everyone
he's ever fired.

486
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,760
Go, go!

487
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:16,330
Macklin,
you son of a bitch.

488
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,999
A lot of people
have been asking me

489
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:21,100
how I feel about everything
that's happened today.

490
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:22,968
Well, let me tell you
a little story.

491
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,506
My dad was this amazing athlete
when he was a kid.

492
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:29,909
When I was in junior high,
I started doing track

493
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:31,377
just to impress him...

494
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:32,779
Even though I hated it.

495
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:36,515
At the end of the year,
I entered the 5,000 meters.

496
00:19:36,582 --> 00:19:40,352
And I won.
It was awesome.

497
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,723
My dad wrapped me in a big hug,
said he was proud of me.

498
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,559
That's just a great story that
happened between me and my dad

499
00:19:47,627 --> 00:19:48,560
and nobody else.

500
00:19:48,628 --> 00:19:49,795
Oh, we're dead.

501
00:19:49,862 --> 00:19:51,563
- It's over.
- That's my story.

502
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:54,264
Before I go, I want to
bring up a special guest.

503
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,468
Somebody who's been very
supportive and mega cool today.

504
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:59,704
Leslie Knope.
Will you come up here?

505
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:01,772
- What?
- Come on, come up here.

506
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,273
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Do...

507
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:05,676
You know, Leslie's been
getting a lot of heat today,

508
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:08,578
but I want you all to know that
we talked person-to-person,

509
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:10,380
and she's really great.

510
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:13,149
People should stop being
so mean to her.

511
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:15,585
In fact, if you don't vote
for me tomorrow,

512
00:20:15,653 --> 00:20:17,387
you should vote for her,

513
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:20,223
because she's super,
super awesome lady.

514
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,125
Leslie, we did it!
Yeah!

515
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:27,062
Maybe we're not dead.

516
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:29,798
Chris, right?

517
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,500
Hi, I'm Jen.

518
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:33,068
Hello.

519
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,371
You know, there are
30 bedrooms in this house.

520
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:38,206
Bobby's in one,
there's a dead guy in another,

521
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:40,041
the rest are free.

522
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:42,610
What do you say?

523
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:46,113
Oh!
That is very flattering.

524
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:49,216
But you're the opposition
campaign manager.

525
00:20:49,284 --> 00:20:51,318
I... I couldn't do that to Leslie.

526
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:52,787
Oh, for God's sake, Chris.

527
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:55,723
This campaign is over.
My job is done and so is yours.

528
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,392
It's just sex.

529
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,027
I'm very good at it.

530
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,028
- Okay.
- Great!

531
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,296
Let's do it.

532
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:05,698
Haven't got all day, honey.

533
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:12,595
Sewage Joe.

534
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:14,531
Ben Wyatt fired you
for sending pictures

535
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:15,732
of your penis to everyone,

536
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,701
and you've come here
to "pie" him.

537
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:19,068
Little twerp has it coming.

538
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:20,102
Oh, dude, I dare you.

539
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,706
Please.

540
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:24,708
Give me one reason
to take you down.

541
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:27,275
I would love nothing more...

542
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:29,378
Oh, [Bleep].
Ben, sorry.

543
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:30,946
All right, let's go.

544
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:32,715
Oh, I did it!

545
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:36,417
Yeah.
Great job.

546
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:41,926
