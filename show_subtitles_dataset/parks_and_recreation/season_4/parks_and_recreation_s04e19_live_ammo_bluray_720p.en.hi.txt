1
00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:01,555
Is the coast clear?

2
00:00:01,575 --> 00:00:02,493
What are you wearing?

3
00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:04,385
My sneak-around clothes.
Is he gone?

4
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:05,736
Yeah, he's gone.
Come in.

5
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,137
You gotta see this.

6
00:00:07,172 --> 00:00:09,073
Tom and I have been seeing
each other for a few weeks,

7
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:12,810
and... I think I'm ready
to say, "I love you"...

8
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:14,044
To his apartment.

9
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:17,915
I... love you so much.

10
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,717
Look at all these blankets.

11
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:21,952
One on the ottoman,
one on the chair,

12
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,421
one on the couch...
here, feel.

13
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:26,590
Holy hell, that's soft.

14
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,092
Oh, my God, is that...

15
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:30,394
Yep! A whole shelf
of coconut water.

16
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:32,730
I think I'm gonna cry.
This is like girl heaven.

17
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:34,164
Did he do all this
just for you?

18
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:35,733
No! He just lives like this.

19
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:38,102
He's deeply in debt,
but you know what? Who cares!

20
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:39,503
'Cause check it out.

21
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:41,572
Cheese plate
and Adriatic figs.

22
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:43,774
Leslie, this is always here.

23
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:45,643
I don't know when he has time
to make it.

24
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:48,646
Boutique eye cream,
unisex cologne,

25
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,048
lip exfoliator,
chocolate-covered almonds,

26
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,984
and a Sudoku book...
just amenities everywhere!

27
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,920
- I love amenities.
- I know!

28
00:00:55,954 --> 00:00:57,288
Check this out.
It's the best part.

29
00:00:57,322 --> 00:00:59,890
80 degrees.
Night and day.

30
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,959
Look at this one.

31
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,577
There's another soft one.

32
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:06,163
Ohh.

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,800
Sync & corrections by Alice

34
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,354
Councilman Pillner,
could I have a moment?

35
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:31,555
Make it quick.

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,724
In his seminal
2009 documentary,

37
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:36,827
filmmaker Ken Burns describes
the national park system

38
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:38,746
as a America's best idea.

39
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,497
- Way quicker.
- Okay.

40
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:42,866
Well, but you should watch
that documentary.

41
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,202
Now I realize that you're
drafting the new city budget,

42
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,704
and I've heard
that you're planning on

43
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:48,839
reducing the parks funding
by 8%.

44
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:52,076
Councilman Pillner,
that cannot happen.

45
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,678
I've gotten to know
the city councilmen pretty well

46
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:55,679
because of my campaign.

47
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:57,181
If you hear any of them

48
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:58,983
talking about that
"blonde pain in the ass,"

49
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:01,151
that's a-me.

50
00:02:01,186 --> 00:02:03,821
Leslie, that budget
is all but finalized.

51
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:06,323
I love building ships
in bottles.

52
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:08,626
When the ship is done,
I put a cork in it,

53
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,943
put it on the shelf,
and I move on.

54
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:11,662
Hold that cork, sir...

55
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:13,280
'Cause I'm about to put
an adorable face

56
00:02:13,315 --> 00:02:15,432
on your proposed cuts.

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,534
Meet Melody Sternway.

58
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:20,137
She's enrolled in five
of our parks programs.

59
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:21,605
Our department
is the only thing

60
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,210
between her and a life
of tube tops and tribal tattoos

61
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:28,879
and barfing in hot tubs.

62
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:30,047
Please.

63
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,448
Okay, you got me.

64
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:33,285
I'll find the cuts
somewhere else.

65
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:41,191
Good morning, everyone!

66
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:44,328
I'm April Ludgate and I will be
filling in for Leslie

67
00:02:44,362 --> 00:02:46,847
while she runs for office.

68
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:51,168
So the new emergency protocol
for the Parks department

69
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:53,437
can be found in your binders.

70
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:56,190
What exactly is the chain
of command vis-a-vis

71
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,524
on-site response?

72
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,327
You know what,
why don't we just say that

73
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,463
whoever gets
to the emergency first

74
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:03,814
will be in charge?

75
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:06,316
Okay, so if there's
an explosion, say,

76
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:09,820
in Ramset Park and someone
from Sewage gets there first,

77
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:12,022
they'd be in charge?

78
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:14,224
I had no idea
how terrible Leslie's job is.

79
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:18,095
She referred to this meeting
as a nonstop thrill ride.

80
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:23,634
I'm not quite sure,
but Tom can answer that if...

81
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,035
What are you doing?

82
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,937
Just bouncing some business
ideas off Russell Simmons

83
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:28,439
on Twitter.

84
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:29,473
Why?

85
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:32,242
All due respect, miss Ludgate, do you
even know what you're doing here?

86
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,511
All due respect,
Mr. hamster penis,

87
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:35,646
but no, I don't.

88
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,382
- My last name is Guiles.
- Are you sure?

89
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,284
Because you look like
a hamster penis.

90
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,370
What about a cologne
that can kill spiders?

91
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:47,157
Ron Swanson, it is my pleasure
to inform you

92
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:49,226
that you are a finalist
for the job

93
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,911
of Assistant City Manager.

94
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:52,880
Chris,
I feel I should remind you

95
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:54,231
that I do not believe

96
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:56,834
that the position or the entire
government should exist.

97
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,970
That said, you'd be a fool
not to pick me.

98
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:02,506
I will walk deeper
into the belly of the beast

99
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,241
if it means I'm able
to further limit

100
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,209
reckless government spending.

101
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,846
I mean, I have so many ideas.

102
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,948
Some are simple
like "take down traffic lights"

103
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:13,317
and "eliminate
the Post Office."

104
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,185
The bigger ones
will be tougher,

105
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,589
like "bring all of this
crumbling to the ground."

106
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:20,958
There is one more step
in the vetting process.

107
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,794
You and I will embark
on a quick session

108
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:26,830
of heart rate meditation,
focusing on conscious breathing

109
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:28,866
and opening the heart chakra.

110
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,001
I'm not sure
I'm interested in that.

111
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:33,804
No, I am sure.
I am not interested in that.

112
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:36,540
Ron, you and I are
very different people,

113
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:38,175
and we have often been
at odds.

114
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:41,712
It is crucial that you and I
spend a day spiritually engaged,

115
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:43,781
and consider what it would
really mean to work together.

116
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,549
Trust me, you'll love it.
I'll see you tomorrow.

117
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,986
Oh, wear your yoga pants.

118
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,320
Okay, I really wish
we would've

119
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,622
talked about this first.

120
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:53,090
What could possibly
be wrong

121
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:54,758
about me saving
the Parks department budget?

122
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:57,027
I don't know.
That's the point.

123
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:59,830
You're thinking like
a Parks department employee,

124
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,865
not a city council candidate.

125
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,033
You're in a campaign
literally.

126
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,301
Everything you do right now
is politics.

127
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:05,953
Oh, really?
Is this politics?

128
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:07,621
Ow.

129
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,972
What is...
what is that?

130
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:11,124
- What... why did you do that?
- I'm in a good mood.

131
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,076
Because the city councilor
listened to me.

132
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,995
It means I have some juice.

133
00:05:15,046 --> 00:05:16,580
Look, this might be
a good thing.

134
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:18,715
But there's a reason
we strategize

135
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,868
- before we make decisions.
- Okay.

136
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:23,387
Okay. I'll make some calls,
see where we are.

137
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:26,023
- Enjoying the view.
- What is going on?

138
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:29,643
I'm just really into you.
Gimme a spin, baby.

139
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:31,762
I hate doing Leslie's job.

140
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:34,164
I'm filling in for a person
who smiles 90% of the time.

141
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,732
Tom, can you please help me?

142
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:38,268
Please?
Or just do it?

143
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,170
Come on, lil sparkle.
Don't give up.

144
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:41,371
What does Leslie always say?

145
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:43,841
I don't know,
weird stuff about waffles.

146
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,443
She says, "you get out
of a job what you put into it."

147
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:48,579
You just need to find a project
you're passionate about.

148
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,347
For instance,
I was incredible

149
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,982
at naming drinks
at the Snakehole Lounge

150
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:54,384
because I care a great deal
about signature beverages.

151
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,920
The Beer-yonce Knowles.

152
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:59,189
It's just a regular beer,
but we put it in a sexy-ass mug.

153
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,091
Pairs nicely
with the Jay-zima.

154
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,126
We bought a bunch of zima
when the factory shut down.

155
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:05,395
That sounds fun.
Maybe I should work at a bar.

156
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,798
Come on, there must be
some aspect of this job

157
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:09,733
you care about.

158
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,335
Hello.

159
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,838
Here are some papers
Leslie requested.

160
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,974
- These are blank.
- Weird.

161
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:18,976
As long as I'm here,
can I ask you a question?

162
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,779
Did you ever participate
in meditation with Chris?

163
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:24,648
Oh, yeah.

164
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:25,949
When we dated,
he made me do it every week.

165
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:28,785
- What am I in for here?
- Okay, here's the deal.

166
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,288
It's crazy boring,
it lasts forever,

167
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:33,057
you're gonna
wish you were dead.

168
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:36,629
Do you wanna borrow
my yoga pants?

169
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:39,730
Hey.

170
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:40,931
So did Pillner finalize
the budget?

171
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,266
Are we okay?

172
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,718
- We are the opposite of okay.
- What do you mean?

173
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,069
To keep the money in Parks,

174
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:47,671
they're gonna shut down
the Westside animal shelter.

175
00:06:47,705 --> 00:06:49,706
The money had to come
from somewhere,

176
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,475
and the shelter is on
its last legs.

177
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,443
So... they're closing it
at the end of the week.

178
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:55,228
That's where Champion
came from.

179
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:56,413
What will happen
to all the other animals?

180
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:59,182
- Well, they'll be...
- Fine.

181
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,752
No.
They'll be...

182
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,954
No!

183
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,455
Guys.

184
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,026
Apparently, Leslie Knope
wielded her insider influence

185
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,911
and got Councilman Pillner

186
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,429
to save her precious
department,

187
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:15,065
even though it meant
closing the shelter.

188
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,868
Now I am not saying that
Leslie Knope is a dog murderer,

189
00:07:17,902 --> 00:07:20,871
per se, I just think that her
actions raise some questions.

190
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:23,373
Like, for example,
is she a dog murderer?

191
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:25,042
God.

192
00:07:25,076 --> 00:07:26,610
Well, I don't know the answer
to that, Jennifer,

193
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:28,879
but your tone makes me think...
Yes.

194
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:32,516
Say your good-byes,
Pebble...

195
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,285
'Cause "Weswie" Knope
gonna kill you.

196
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,621
She got the perfect puppy
for that shot.

197
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:38,956
She is good.

198
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,474
Leslie, there is a woman
on the phone

199
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:42,125
that says her daughter's scared
to go to sleep

200
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,996
because Leslie Knope's going
to come murder her kitty.

201
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,165
- Okay, we can fix this.
- Yes, we can.

202
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,067
Tomorrow morning,
we are going back to Pillner

203
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:51,702
and telling him to cut
the Parks budget.

204
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:52,869
No, no, no, no.

205
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,105
We can figure
something else out.

206
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,433
Leslie!

207
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:08,685
Hey, honey, good morning.
How did you sleep?

208
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,988
I adopted 32 cats and dogs.
Do you want pancakes?

209
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,056
- I'm gonna make pancakes.
- Is that a pig?

210
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:14,424
- What? Which one?
- Is that a pig?

211
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,660
You talking about this one?
This one right here?

212
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:19,129
Yes, that is a pig.

213
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,190
This is the best
meditation center in the area.

214
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,790
It doesn't look like much.

215
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,960
Actually, this strip mall
has surprisingly decent chi.

216
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:34,496
Although, the smells from
the Greek restaurant next door

217
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,897
are not ideal.

218
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:40,435
But through this door
lies a deep, serene quietude.

219
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,142
Excuse me, ladies.
On your right.

220
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,010
After you, Ron.

221
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,513
Now... take in the vibe
of the room

222
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,783
and remain open of mind
and of spirit.

223
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:57,202
Now quietly...
sit behind me

224
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,920
and let's join breath.

225
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:02,374
- I'll stand.
- Interesting technique.

226
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,569
Andy, look at this little guy!

227
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:16,604
He's such a little runt.
Hey, there.

228
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,256
Hey, Tom, look.

229
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,875
Oh, I just had five cats on me
at once!

230
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,977
You wanna come in here
and try to break my record?

231
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:24,763
That's okay, Andy, I think
I'm gonna keep my distance.

232
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,448
Don't want none
of that animal dander

233
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,382
interacting
with this cashmere.

234
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,218
What's your endgame here,
my dear?

235
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,686
This is only temporary

236
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,438
until I find a way
to keep the shelter open

237
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,823
without cutting
the Parks budget.

238
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:36,891
Hey, what if I threw together
a pet adoption

239
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,910
in one of our parks...
would that be cool?

240
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,562
April, that would be
the coolest thing

241
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:43,998
since 'N Sync, Aerosmith,
and Nelly performed together

242
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,366
at the Super Bowl
halftime show.

243
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:46,801
Ew.

244
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,369
I think I may have found
a project

245
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:50,805
I'd actually enjoy doing...

246
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,741
helping these cats and dogs.

247
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,743
They should be rewarded
for not being people.

248
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:57,245
I hate people.

249
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,380
I'm very proud of you,
April.

250
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:01,649
Meanwhile, you and I are gonna
look at the town budget

251
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,052
and we're gonna find
something expendable.

252
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:06,654
Hey, Ben, the pig ate
your noise-canceling headphones.

253
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,126
Pigs are awesome!

254
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,646
All told, we were in there
about six hours.

255
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,298
And no,
I was not meditating.

256
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,567
I just stood there,
quietly breathing.

257
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,836
There were no thoughts
in my head whatsoever.

258
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,972
My mind was blank.

259
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:26,775
I don't know what the hell
these other crackpots are doing.

260
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,297
Jerry, the puppies are going
to the bathroom everywhere.

261
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,648
We can't let people see that.

262
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:35,967
I need you to continuously
clean out the cages, okay?

263
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:37,451
- You got it, boss.
- Thank you.

264
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,071
Donna, did you put the info
sheets on all the cages?

265
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,289
- Last one.
- Great.

266
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:43,591
Each animal has a photo,
special talents,

267
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:44,926
and a personal history...

268
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,761
That I made up.

269
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:49,898
A lot of these dogs have rescued
people from burning buildings.

270
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:52,433
This one helped Ray Charles
around.

271
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:55,937
What?
This cat was in Boogie Nights?

272
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:59,023
- Hi. You like this little guy?
- He's so cute.

273
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:00,275
I know.

274
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:02,310
All the animal are up-to-date
on their shots.

275
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,813
- And I think he likes you.
- He's pretty awesome.

276
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,181
Did you know
his great-grandfather

277
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:07,949
was Spuds Mackenzie?

278
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:10,985
What do you think, sweetie?
Do you wanna take him home?

279
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,654
Yes, please.

280
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,957
Realistically,
I'm guessing we dropped

281
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,493
three to five points
in the polls.

282
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,563
This late in the game,
it's killer.

283
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,097
And that's a dog biscuit.

284
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:24,599
Andy put them on the table

285
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:26,667
'cause he wanted to try
to have the dogs play poker.

286
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,053
Okay, Leslie,
we are out of time.

287
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:31,406
- We have to go back to them.
- Oh, my God!

288
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,809
This is it.

289
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:37,078
Hmm.

290
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:39,247
Oh, for God's sake, Leslie.

291
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,548
There's just not enough money
to do all the things

292
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,849
you wanna do.

293
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,185
You're trying to fit
two ships into one bottle.

294
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,588
Take it from me,
you can't do that.

295
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,789
Okay, just look at this.

296
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:50,792
There are three employees
designated as D1,

297
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:52,160
or on retainer.

298
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:53,494
Public Works is still
paying them

299
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,363
even though they haven't worked
in two years.

300
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,698
It's an oversight.

301
00:11:56,732 --> 00:11:58,366
We get rid of them
and we have just enough money

302
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,767
to keep the animal shelter
operating

303
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,803
while still maintaining
the Parks budget.

304
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,137
Interesting.

305
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,089
Looks like we found
a bigger bottle.

306
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,975
I know you're just
making a joke,

307
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,444
but using a bigger bottle
would be considered cheating

308
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,312
by most of our major
trade publications.

309
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,014
FYI.

310
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,717
Ron, you've radiated
mindfulness.

311
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,151
What were you thinking about?

312
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,621
- I wasn't thinking at all.
- Incredible.

313
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,623
It takes a ton of work
for me

314
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,491
to get to that kind of
a clear head space,

315
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,126
no matter how hard I try.

316
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,161
Don't try so hard.

317
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:30,365
Don't try... so hard.

318
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,967
Ron, I'm going to try
your "not trying" method

319
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,602
right here, right now.

320
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,504
Chris, wait.

321
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,473
I know this crap
is important to you,

322
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,141
so I should come clean.

323
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,510
I got nothing
out of that experience at all.

324
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:45,280
So if you're looking for someone
who enjoys meditation...

325
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:46,748
Oh, I didn't expect you
to enjoy it.

326
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:49,684
My one reservation about you
as a co-worker

327
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:51,185
was that you seem inflexible.

328
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,854
And merely by agreeing

329
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:54,489
to an activity you're not
interested in,

330
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,858
you showed flexibility.

331
00:12:56,892 --> 00:13:00,061
Ron, you've got the job.

332
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:01,729
- You wanna head back?
- I do.

333
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:05,633
But first, there's a hot,
spinning cone of meat

334
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,902
in that Greek restaurant
next door.

335
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:12,440
I don't know what it is, but
I'd like to eat the whole thing.

336
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:14,608
Why is it so dead?
Where is everyone?

337
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,577
Don't give up yet.
There's a few minutes left.

338
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:18,946
Is this where we drop off
our unwanted cats?

339
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,833
- No. It's the opposite.
- Okay.

340
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,502
I'm just gonna put these here
for a second.

341
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,888
And then, uh...

342
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,625
We ended up with more animals
than we started with.

343
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,410
This is what happens
when you try.

344
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,345
All of these animals
are gonna die.

345
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,730
God!

346
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:37,098
I hope you're happy,

347
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,033
stupid people
in this stupid town!

348
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,136
Hey!
Hey, you!

349
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:44,939
Get back here and get your
[Bleep] cats out of there!

350
00:13:44,974 --> 00:13:47,241
Do you think
Barack and Michelle Obama

351
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:48,977
feel like this
at the end of the day?

352
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:51,079
Probably.
I mean, I don't know how else...

353
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:52,914
wait a second.
Is that...

354
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:54,449
so am I Michelle?

355
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:57,085
Hey, how is everyone?

356
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,419
- Great!
- Pretty good.

357
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,588
We saved the animal shelter
and the Parks budget.

358
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,890
That's great news.
Let me guess.

359
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,859
You found room in other parts
of the budget somewhere?

360
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:06,194
Totally.

361
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:08,829
Got rid of a bunch of lame-ass
D1's from Public Works.

362
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,998
Awesome news.

363
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:11,883
Hey, you know what else
is pretty neat,

364
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,101
is thanks to you,

365
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,303
councilman Pillner
went through the budget

366
00:14:15,337 --> 00:14:17,171
and decided that
not just Public Works

367
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,273
but all D1's will be terminated
in two weeks.

368
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:21,842
- I'm getting fired.
- Ba-what now?

369
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,921
Oh! Councilman Houser...

370
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,810
I was just looking for you.

371
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,421
I have found my assistant
city manager.

372
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:31,223
You wanna guess who it is?
It's Ron Swanson!

373
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:32,874
I'm sorry.
I should've let you guess.

374
00:14:32,925 --> 00:14:33,992
I'm just so excited.

375
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:35,627
I'd put a pin in this
for now.

376
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:37,629
Why?
Why pin it?

377
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:39,197
The council vote
is three to two

378
00:14:39,232 --> 00:14:40,599
in favor of another term
for you.

379
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:42,634
But one of the yes votes
is retiring.

380
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:44,102
If Bobby Newport wins,

381
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,337
he's gonna try to bring in
his own guy.

382
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:46,738
Why would he do that?

383
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,523
He's not exactly thrilled
you've been volunteering

384
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:50,876
for the Knope campaign
in your spare time.

385
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,211
Sorry, Chris.
If Newport wins...

386
00:14:53,246 --> 00:14:54,748
You're gone.

387
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:59,100
I just need one more week.

388
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,786
- And then I think...
- Sorry, could you please...

389
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,287
Be careful?

390
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:04,408
Oh, I am always careful.

391
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:07,659
We're good.

392
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,494
If I could just get
a little bit more time,

393
00:15:09,528 --> 00:15:10,929
I could figure out
how to fix this.

394
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:13,364
Unfortunately, I cannot
give you any more time.

395
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:14,533
With due respect...

396
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,401
Leslie, I am retiring
at the end of this term,

397
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:17,903
so I've been fine
with you guys

398
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:19,437
pushing me around
on this budget thing.

399
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:22,040
But if you're ever
gonna hold this job,

400
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:23,775
there's something you need
to understand.

401
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,511
City Council isn't about
making everybody in town happy.

402
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,313
In fact,
every decision you make

403
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:31,283
is gonna make a lot of people
very unhappy.

404
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:35,053
We play with live ammo
around here.

405
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,155
Now I'm gonna close the book
on this budget draft

406
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,824
by the end
of the business day.

407
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:41,493
So if you can find some way
out of this mess by 5:00 P.M.,

408
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:42,894
you let me know.

409
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:44,729
- Thank you.
- That's fair.

410
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:46,698
I did it!
I got it out.

411
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:49,034
Oh, geez.
You don't take the ship out.

412
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,837
Here you go.

413
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,540
Chris! Great news!

414
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:59,845
I found a way to reduce
government spending by 85%.

415
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,813
Here's a hint...
no more departments.

416
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:04,916
Ha, that crazy
and impractical plan

417
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:06,251
may have to wait.

418
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,053
Turns out that Bobby Newport,
if he beats Leslie,

419
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,387
is going to appoint
his own city manager.

420
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:11,056
So I may have
offered you a job

421
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,125
that I have no authority
to offer.

422
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,263
- I'm so so sorry.
- Well, that is disappointing.

423
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:20,165
But don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.

424
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:21,533
Oh, I know.

425
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,418
I mean, in the grand scheme
of things, who cares?

426
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,836
We're all just molecules,

427
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:28,206
floating around
in random patterns...

428
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:30,942
Devoid of meaning.

429
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:32,677
Well, I'll see you
when I see you.

430
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,312
I'm a rolling stone.

431
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,214
- Peace.
- Stop.

432
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:38,216
Have a seat.

433
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:42,120
We did things your way,
now we're gonna do it my way.

434
00:16:42,138 --> 00:16:45,456
Prepare to experience
true freedom and bliss.

435
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:48,293
Oh, maybe I should just go
back to being a nurse full-time.

436
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:51,863
No, I will not let you return
to a life of shaving wieners

437
00:16:51,898 --> 00:16:53,865
and dodging knife attacks
from meth heads.

438
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,769
Right.
Okay, what are you gonna do?

439
00:16:57,803 --> 00:17:00,972
Well, either you get fired,
the Parks budget shrinks,

440
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,374
or the animal shelter's
gotta go.

441
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:03,808
Or we find money
somewhere else.

442
00:17:03,843 --> 00:17:05,911
Okay, Leslie,
there is nowhere else.

443
00:17:05,945 --> 00:17:08,713
This is a town budget,
not a bottomless trust fund.

444
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:10,615
Okay?

445
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:11,850
Money doesn't just appear
out of nowhere.

446
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:13,118
- Shh. Stop talking.
- What?

447
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:14,486
Shh.

448
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,154
I have half an idea
and I'm putting it together.

449
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:17,422
- Okay.
- Hey!

450
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:18,590
- Do you wanna...
- Heh.

451
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:19,658
- I'm...
- No!

452
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:21,726
- Do you?
- Unh. Shh.

453
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,029
Okay, now I have
a complete idea.

454
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:27,465
Ben, I'm going to commit
political suicide.

455
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:35,540
Hey, it's me. Tommy!

456
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:37,075
- Hi!
- I'm not here.

457
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:38,310
April.

458
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:39,644
Swear on my
great-great-grandmother's grave

459
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:40,779
I'm not here.

460
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,731
I'm gonna come in
for a second.

461
00:17:42,782 --> 00:17:44,582
Can you just
leave me alone?

462
00:17:44,617 --> 00:17:46,868
Why so glum,
sugar plum?

463
00:17:46,902 --> 00:17:48,286
Um, I don't know.

464
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,355
Maybe because I worked so hard
on that dumb pet adoption

465
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:52,023
and I failed.

466
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:53,959
That's why it's stupid
to work hard.

467
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:55,093
Let me show you something.

468
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:56,745
Because you worked hard,

469
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:59,497
this little terribly-dressed
girl has a puppy.

470
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:02,033
And this little puppy
has a home.

471
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:04,669
If Leslie's taught me anything,
it's that yes,

472
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:07,806
98% of the time,
this job is frustrating

473
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,975
and you hit brick walls.

474
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:13,878
But the other 2%,
it's stuff like this kid.

475
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:15,747
And that puppy.

476
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,449
What... what is that photo?

477
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,451
That must come preloaded
in there or something.

478
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:22,454
- Oh, my God.
- See you at work tomorrow?

479
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:23,788
Fine.

480
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:24,923
All right.

481
00:18:24,957 --> 00:18:27,027
Bye, pups!
Bye, little piggies!

482
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:32,030
I don't usually poison my body
with dark alcohol,

483
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:35,133
but this whiskey is...
excellent!

484
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,401
Nectar of the gods.

485
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:39,471
Well, I should get
back to my office.

486
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:41,573
As long as I have one.

487
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:44,242
Chris, I'm not one
for positive thinking

488
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:46,594
or visualization
or meditation

489
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:48,913
or really anything in the world
that you believe in.

490
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:52,417
But you might consider
the upside of losing your job.

491
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:54,185
For example?

492
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,955
You would no longer be
a government parasite,

493
00:18:56,989 --> 00:18:59,724
sucking the lifeblood from
honest, hardworking people.

494
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,195
Instead, you'd contribute
to society like a man.

495
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,097
That's just one way
it might be good.

496
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:07,750
I'm sure there are others.

497
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:11,271
I'm sure there are.

498
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,709
Uh-oh. You look serious.
What's on the agenda?

499
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:19,294
Just one item, Jennifer.

500
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:20,778
You're going to announce

501
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:22,280
that Bobby Newport will use
his personal fortune

502
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:23,548
to save the animal shelter.

503
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:26,718
No.
No, that's...

504
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:29,454
that's, um...

505
00:19:29,488 --> 00:19:30,955
that is a great idea.

506
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,258
In fact, I don't know why
I hadn't thought of it already.

507
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,559
Damn it.
Damn it!

508
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:37,345
I swear the air in this town
is killing my brain cells.

509
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:39,030
Actually, the water's not good
for you either.

510
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:40,265
You shouldn't drink
the tap water.

511
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:41,433
Has anyone told you that yet?

512
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:43,902
In exchange,
no more puppy killer ads

513
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:45,437
for the rest of the campaign.

514
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:47,305
- That's all we ask.
- Okay.

515
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:49,607
Well, what's to stop me
from just paying for the shelter

516
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:50,608
and still running the ads?

517
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,110
Because I told
councilman Pillner

518
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:53,478
that if you don't agree
to our terms,

519
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:54,779
he should cut
the Parks budget.

520
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:57,482
And we'll leak that
it was Leslie's decision

521
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:59,284
and yours seem
tough and fair,

522
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:01,786
what with sacrificing
her old apartment.

523
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:04,155
Okay, what's in it
for you?

524
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,424
A safe home for the animals,
a job for my friend,

525
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,725
and a full Parks budget.

526
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,194
I wasn't born yesterday.

527
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:11,729
You've gotta have an angle.
This is a home run for us!

528
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:13,631
We're gonna dominate
the news cycle for a whole week.

529
00:20:13,665 --> 00:20:16,184
Well, you can have this week.
We'll take the next one.

530
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:18,236
Oh, yeah?
What makes you so sure?

531
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,505
Because in a week,
we have a debate.

532
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:23,341
And your guy Bobby Newport
is gonna have to show up,

533
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,343
and he's gonna
have to open his mouth.

534
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:28,079
And I'm gonna kick his ass.

535
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:30,815
She'll take care of that.
See ya next week!

536
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,668
How's my best buddy?
Just bought this.

537
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:39,153
Cranium. It's a board game.
Have you heard of it?

538
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:42,072
It is literally the most fun
I have ever had.

539
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:43,224
What do you say,
after work,

540
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,227
you, me, whiskey, wheatgrass,
Cranium?

541
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,945
- Ron?
- Chris?

542
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:50,498
Sorry, he's meditating.

543
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:51,999
He asked me to tell
anyone who comes in

544
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,134
that he wishes
to remain undisturbed

545
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,004
so as to better clarify
his head space.

546
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,339
Oh, God, Ron.
I am so sorry.

547
00:20:58,373 --> 00:20:59,689
I'll let you get at it.

548
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:06,689
