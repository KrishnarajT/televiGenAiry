1
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:04,203
Andy got back from London two days ago
and he still has jet lag.

2
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:05,590
It's really annoying.

3
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,181
We're on totally different
schedules.

4
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,861
Last night he mowed the lawn
at 2:00 in the morning.

5
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:12,547
Andy!
Andy!

6
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,649
- Get me a beer?
- All right.

7
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:15,633
As soon as I wake up,

8
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:17,666
he goes down.
Hard.

9
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:19,637
This has to stop!

10
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:21,639
Babe, wake up.

11
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:24,459
That's my spaghetti, Chewbacca.

12
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:25,426
Babe!

13
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:30,071
You hungry, Champion?

14
00:01:30,106 --> 00:01:31,406
Oh, my God.

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,874
Are you kidding me?

16
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:39,714
Hey. Oh, man,
I fell asleep again.

17
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:41,383
Andy, you have got to stay up

18
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,817
and get on a regular schedule.

19
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,121
Were you about to spray me
with the hose inside the house?

20
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,940
- Yeah.
- I kinda want you to do it now.

21
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:51,026
- Okay.
- Aah! Aah!

22
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,494
Aaahhh!

23
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:55,463
No, no, no, no, no, no!

25
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:21,906
Okay, just a reminder, guys,
today is Leslie's last day

26
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,425
as a city councilor,

27
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,527
so everyone be extra supportive.

28
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:26,528
Already done.

29
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,363
When she walked past me
this morning,

30
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,915
I gave her a kind nod.

31
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,317
Heartwarming.

32
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,952
Also I want to get her
a present to cheer her up

33
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,086
on her last day.

34
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,588
Any ideas?

35
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:38,339
A "sorry you lost
your dream job" gift?

36
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,325
Mm, that's a tough one.
Stay away from wine.

37
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,593
Wine is crying juice.

38
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:43,211
Well, I mean, you know her
better than anybody.

39
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,980
What does she really want?
More than anything in the world?

40
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:48,683
A nice candle.
I'm screwed.

41
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:50,868
No! Andy!

42
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:52,637
- An-Andy!
- Oh! Come on!

43
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:55,073
- Andy!
- Be right out.

44
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:58,109
Well, this is the
Pawnee City Council chambers.

45
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:00,195
Your new home away from me.

46
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:02,197
Well, technically, my home
away from home is in Zurich.

47
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,300
Frank Gehry designed it.
But this is nice too.

48
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:06,384
Today is my last day

49
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,386
As a—excuse me.

50
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,155
Let me try this again.

51
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,639
Today is
my last day at C—

52
00:03:11,674 --> 00:03:13,458
Today is my la—

53
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:14,559
Today is my last d—

54
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:15,877
You know what?
You get the idea.

55
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:17,912
My old friend Ingrid de Forest
won the recall vote,

56
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:19,981
and she's taking my place
on Monday morning.

57
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:21,349
But, you know, luckily for me,

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,650
I've processed all my feelings.

59
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:25,120
And I've gone through
the five stages of grief:

60
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,138
Denial, anger,
Internet commenting,

61
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,573
cat adoption, African dance,

62
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,825
cat returning
to the adoption place,

63
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:32,477
watching all the episodes
of Murphy Brown,

64
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:34,129
and not giving a flying fart.

65
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,231
How many stages is that?

66
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,232
I don't know.

67
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,967
The point is I'm fine now.

68
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,969
This must be hard for you.

69
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,288
It's like what
sir Ian McKellen said to me

70
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:45,240
the day I sold my boat
to Karl Lagerfeld:

71
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,675
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

72
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,978
Oh, my God.
What is your life?

73
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,189
If it makes any difference,

74
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,231
your work here
was a real inspiration to me,

75
00:03:53,265 --> 00:03:56,651
and I am going to do my best
to continue your legacy.

76
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:59,838
Well, I appreciate
the sentiment.

77
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,659
Leslie.

78
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,344
I'm sorry.
Was I singing

79
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:08,246
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road
out loud?

80
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,515
No. But would you like to?

81
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:11,883
I studied opera at the Sorbonne.

82
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,234
I'd be happy to harmonize.

83
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,036
Goodbye...

84
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,754
Goodbye...

85
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:18,139
Naw.

86
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,724
And finally,

87
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:21,609
here is a check
for the entirety

88
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,011
of the purchase
of Rent-A-Swag.

89
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,162
And here is a personal note

90
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,265
from my client
Dr. Saperstein.

91
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:28,483
"Dear Tom:
I win.

92
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:30,185
"You suck.
Turn note over.

93
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,235
"You still suck.

94
00:04:31,253 --> 00:04:33,054
Turn note over."

95
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,139
Okay, Saperstein
couldn't even face me himself?

96
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,274
He had to send in his lackey?

97
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,275
My client isn't at this meeting

98
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:38,693
because he doesn't have to be.

99
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:39,944
Successful people,
Mr. Haverford,

100
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,580
use their money to use others
to work for them.

101
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,599
Hmm, it's an interesting idea,
lawyer-dude.

102
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,501
What if I gave you 5 bucks
to put a bag of poop

103
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:47,535
in Saperstein's car?

104
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:48,803
No.

105
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:51,523
Ballpark me.
How much would it cost?

106
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,524
$10,000.

107
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,192
Counter-offer:

108
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:55,577
Why don't you just do it
for the story?

109
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:58,162
Goodbye, Mr. Haverford.

110
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,647
Is it done?

111
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:03,001
Well, how many times
did he turn the paper over?

112
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:06,471
Oh, that is disappointing.

113
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,380
So...

114
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,290
look at this baby.

115
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,441
That is
the most symmetrical fetus

116
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:11,459
I've ever seen.

117
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:13,578
This could be a superhero.

118
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,013
- Dr. Saperstein.
- Yes.

119
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,481
I know that we should hate you

120
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:18,099
because you destroyed
our friend's business.

121
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,151
- But we love you so much!
- We love you!

122
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,319
I'm loveable!

123
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:23,087
So do you wanna know the sex?

124
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,906
Oh, my God.
Should we?

125
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,024
N-no, right?
Or maybe yes?

126
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,927
Is there an option
other than yes or no?

127
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,061
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

128
00:05:30,095 --> 00:05:31,479
I'm gonna write it down.

129
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,197
Then I'm gonna put it
in an envelope,

130
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,282
seal it, and when you're ready,

131
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,617
voila!

132
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,219
- That'll be fun!
- That's like the Oscars.

133
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,104
Hey, let's get some food.

134
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:41,356
I'm starving.

135
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,874
Wait, no, I have to pee.

136
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,292
Wait, no, I have to barf.

137
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:46,077
Actually, all three.

138
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,279
Being pregnant is great.

139
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,232
And, finally, Larry's share
of the profit.

140
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:52,500
Whoa! Good to be Larry.

141
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:53,585
No, it's not,
you boring grandpa.

142
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,387
Meanwhile, Tommy's ridin' high.

143
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:57,521
$32,000.

144
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,689
I'm basically a millionaire.

145
00:05:58,707 --> 00:05:59,924
What are you gonna do
with the money, Tom?

146
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,175
Glad you asked.

147
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,227
A horrible man recently gave me
some great advice.

148
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,663
For years, I've been coming up
with my own ideas.

149
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,899
Like some sort of
non-rich idiot.

150
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,867
Now I'm gonna let people
come to me

151
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:11,636
and invest my scrilla
in the best idea I hear.

152
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,637
That sounds like

153
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:14,322
an efficient use
of the free market.

154
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:16,090
I would wish you
the best of luck,

155
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,926
but I believe luck is
a concept invented by the weak

156
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,361
to explain their failures.

157
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:21,979
Come hear the ideas
with me, Ron.

158
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:23,498
I could use your wise,
grandfatherly advice.

159
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,050
Do you think everyone here
is a grandfather?

160
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:27,051
Basically, if you're
older than me,

161
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,219
you're a grandpa.

162
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:29,553
And if you are a grandpa,
you're dead.

163
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:30,521
That sounds right.

164
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,539
Uh, oops.

165
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,911
This check is made out
to "Lenny,"

166
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,676
which I think is a typo
for "Larry,"

167
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,311
which isn't
even actually my name.

168
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,446
Well, tell it
to the bank, Lenny.

169
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,865
Am I—am I Lenny now?

170
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,835
I'd like to order
a singing telegram.

171
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:47,021
Well, my wife lost her job,
so maybe something sad and slow.

172
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:48,122
Do you know anything from

173
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:49,707
The Requiem for a Dream
soundtrack?

174
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,925
This is a bad idea.

175
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,327
I'm hanging up now. Bye.

176
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,211
Well, Ingrid is settled
into my office,

177
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,230
and this box contains
the last of my stuff.

178
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:58,232
Although I might have left
some salt packets in my desk.

179
00:06:58,283 --> 00:06:59,817
Maybe I should go back
for those?

180
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:01,586
Honey, it's okay,
there'll be other salt packets.

181
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,504
But not the kind
that snaps in half, maybe.

182
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,440
Okay, I know
I'm a broken record,

183
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:07,558
but getting away
from the City Council

184
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:09,032
is absolutely
the best thing for you.

185
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,329
Trust me.

186
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:13,631
This is Perd Hapley
talking to you now

187
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,000
about what's going on today.

188
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,602
We're live at City Hall

189
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,737
where City Councilman Dexhart
is addressing

190
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,089
his latest sex scandal.

191
00:07:21,123 --> 00:07:23,958
Recently, certain allegations
have come to light

192
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:26,227
about my inappropriate conduct.

193
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:29,247
I'm here
to set the record straight.

194
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,917
I totally did all of it.

195
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,136
Another sex scandal?
This guy's unbelievable.

196
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,521
How does he find the time?

197
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:39,190
I also engaged in
inappropriate texting,

198
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:42,443
sexting,
and tex-mexting,

199
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,096
which is where you send
photos of your junk

200
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,548
from the restroom
of a chili's to go.

201
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,400
- Hmm.
- Ew.

202
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:51,235
Does this make me a bad boy?

203
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,004
You tell me.

204
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,255
No. Really.

205
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,306
Tell me.

206
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,675
It gets me off
when women tell me that.

207
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:59,193
He's reading this,
he wrote this down.

208
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,213
I sent these texts
to roughly 100 women

209
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:04,315
under the following pseudonyms:

210
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,649
Enrique Shockwave,

211
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,885
Willie Dynamite,

212
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,288
Lee Harvey Teabag...

213
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,489
Well, at least
you won't have to deal

214
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:12,874
with that guy anymore.

215
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,825
- You're right.
- Lieutenant Wilhelm Von Penis.

216
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,994
Not after someone beats him
in the next election.

217
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,380
Someone who is smart
and hard-working

218
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,799
and who knows the job
because she's done it already

219
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,935
and is also blond
and named Leslie

220
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:24,936
and loves you.

221
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,438
- Is it you?
- Yes! It is!

222
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,606
I'm gonna run again.

223
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,108
I'm gonna beat Dexhart!

224
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,275
And Anthony Weiner.

225
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,574
Another City Council campaign?

226
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:36,008
Leslie, think about what you're saying.

227
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:38,216
I did. I challenge you
to find one flaw in my plan.

228
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,517
Well, for one,

229
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:40,835
we don't even live
in Dexhart's district.

230
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,953
Not yet!

231
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,196
But we can go and rent
a second apartment,

232
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,115
and we can spend 51%
of our time there.

233
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:47,466
And then I'll file
the campaign form

234
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:48,901
from that address.

235
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:51,487
I don't want to spend 51%
of our time in his district.

236
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,672
It's basically a dumping ground
for old shipping containers.

237
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,924
It's like a raccoon shantytown.

238
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,143
Oh, it's not that bad.

239
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:59,111
And also, Dexhart fights dirty.

240
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,329
He's never lost an election

241
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:03,149
because he runs brutal,
scorched-earth campaigns.

242
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:04,650
So what? I got plenty
of dirt on that scumbag.

243
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:05,868
I say, "Bring it on."

244
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:07,219
So I'm gonna start

245
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:08,771
my negative PR blitz
against Dexhart and—

246
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:12,408
Look, I just think we need
to take a deep breath...

247
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,043
Think about
if this is really worth it.

248
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:17,780
Anything is worth me
getting back on City Council.

249
00:09:17,814 --> 00:09:19,382
Okay.

250
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,300
Let's see which one
of these lucky visionaries

251
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:23,302
is gonna make me rich.

252
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:25,488
Greg Phillips!

253
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:27,073
Hi, guys, thanks
for meeting with me.

254
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:28,174
Enough chitchat. What's
your pitch, kid?

255
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,625
Come on, time is money,
money is power,

256
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,077
power is pizza,
pizza is knowledge.

257
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,278
- Let's go.
- Okay.

258
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:36,766
So my idea is for an abacus,
but on your phone.

259
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,301
I call it a "phone-bacus."

260
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:42,404
Son, you just described
a calculator.

261
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,540
Hey, but you're talking
about it, right?

262
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,608
Three words:

263
00:09:45,642 --> 00:09:47,977
Automated word counter.

264
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:49,411
Get out.

265
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:50,879
Two. Words.

266
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:53,115
- No.
- One. Word.

267
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,784
As you may know,

268
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:57,303
I do like to tinker with things
in my garage.

269
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:59,588
I'm gonna hit the can
while he's up.

270
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:00,906
So I think I have discovered

271
00:10:00,941 --> 00:10:05,311
a way to generate
clean, renewable energy.

272
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:07,079
I think it's gonna ch—

273
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:09,231
Oh! Gross!

274
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,416
God, Larry.

275
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,500
You sneezed all over us!

276
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:12,601
I'm not gonna buy that thing.

277
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:14,236
It's covered in a gallon
of your boogers.

278
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:16,071
I totally understand.

279
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,560
Uh, jeez.

280
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,346
I will be thrilled
if we have a girl.

281
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:25,965
Oh, tiny dresses?

282
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,382
Braids?
Glitter on everything?

283
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Forget it.

284
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:30,169
And also, girls' names
are so cute.

285
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,671
Daisy, Annabelle, Lilly.

286
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:36,709
Olive, rosemary, chicken.
Fifty burritos.

287
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:38,327
Oh, my God, I'm starving.
Miss, hi!

288
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,396
I'm pregnant, and I'm
a little bit crazy.

289
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,480
So if you don't bring
our appetizers out

290
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:42,765
in the next 30 seconds,

291
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,168
I'm gonna plunge your face
into the deep fryer!

292
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,153
And also two waters, please.

293
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:48,804
But no hurry.

294
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,089
Thank you.

295
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,207
Leslie, I don't know
if there's a story

296
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:52,407
in these emails.

297
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:53,859
They're iffy,

298
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:55,477
but Dexhart
has been elected eight times.

299
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:57,363
I don't think the voters care.

300
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,448
His poll numbers are actually up
since the scandal broke.

301
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:00,582
Well, that's
just because people found out

302
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,134
he was Miley Cyrus' cousin.

303
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:03,652
- He is?
- Good morning, Leslie.

304
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,704
"Sweet jugs."

305
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:08,957
What?

306
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,342
He's kinda cute.

307
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:11,777
Oh, God, Shauna, no.

308
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:14,079
I-I just feel like
I could fix him, you know?

309
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:16,999
This sucks!

310
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:19,268
We heard a hundred pitches,
and they're all terrible.

311
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:20,920
Change of plans.

312
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:21,921
You guys are my idea factory.

313
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,606
- April, go.
- Okay, got one.

314
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,507
Macaroni and poison.

315
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,943
It's like mac and cheese,
but with a special ingredient.

316
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:28,944
Ron?

317
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,379
Every socket set
I've ever bought

318
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:32,264
only goes up to 1/2 inch.

319
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,183
I'd love a couple larger sizes.

320
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,618
Take it all the way up to 5/8.

321
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:37,636
Andy?

322
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:41,740
Bears bouncing
on trampoline roads.

323
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:44,593
There's a chance
that I might have dreamed that.

324
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:46,896
Okay, time to head back
to the office.

325
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,781
I've missed
an entire day of work,

326
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:52,384
so at least some good
came from this.

327
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:53,835
What are you doing?

328
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:55,638
Well, they couldn't make
a banner in time

329
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:58,340
for my press conference,
so I am cobbling together

330
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,676
a banner from
all the other discarded banners.

331
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,896
"Second chunce four Lesle!

332
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:08,017
"Perv Dexxxhrt equals...

333
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:09,985
- birthday mouse"?
- Rat!

334
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,720
Well, that's the closest thing
I could get to a rat.

335
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:13,572
Leslie, listen to yourself.

336
00:12:13,623 --> 00:12:16,592
Loopholes,
scorched-earth policies.

337
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:17,977
This isn't you.

338
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:19,928
I cannot believe you aren't
supporting me on this!

339
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:22,631
Dexhart has a sex scandal
the same day I'm leaving office?

340
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,383
That is not a coincidence.

341
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,434
This was meant to be.

342
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,518
You know what?

343
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,103
Why don't we gather everyone
in here,

344
00:12:28,137 --> 00:12:30,322
you explain to them
what you're thinking,

345
00:12:30,357 --> 00:12:31,707
and, uh, we get some feedback.

346
00:12:31,741 --> 00:12:33,726
Now you're talking.

347
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,811
I would be thrilled
if we had a boy.

348
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:38,280
I have perfected the art
of shaving the human face.

349
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:40,249
And I would love to be able
to pass that on.

350
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:42,635
Toy trucks?
Superhero costumes?

351
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,720
Tiny little acorn penis?
Forget it.

352
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:45,921
A weird image.

353
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,140
But one that does not diminish
my enthusiasm.

354
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:49,992
Well, Ann Perkins,

355
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,860
are you ready to find out
the sex of our baby?

356
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:53,762
I'm ready.

357
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:55,864
We are having a...

358
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,417
"distributions."

359
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:00,068
That's what it looks like:
Distributions.

360
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,470
Let me see that.

361
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:03,689
It says "congratulations,"
I think.

362
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:04,806
Then it says,

363
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:06,859
"I... leg smurf."

364
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,027
Are we having a smurf?

365
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,297
We are having a...
"11-jewel toilet."

366
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,415
I can't tell what's words
and what's punctuation!

367
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,767
The suspense is killing me!

368
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:15,768
I'm calling Dr. Saperstein.

369
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,152
I'm calling Domino's.

370
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:18,537
Do you think Domino's delivers
to this restaurant?

371
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:20,589
- I hope so.
- Oh, no.

372
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:21,824
He's out
for the rest of the day!

373
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:25,894
I have literally never been
more stressed out.

374
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:27,596
Oh, good! You guys are here!

375
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:29,331
Okay, everybody gather around.
I have a big announcement.

376
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,834
I am officially
seeking reelection

377
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:33,218
to the Pawnee City Council.

378
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:35,354
I am gonna be running
for Dexhart's seat.

379
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:39,274
And the campaign starts now.

380
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:42,244
Oh, I love the sound of silence

381
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:43,862
before a big cheer.

382
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:45,497
That's what's happening, right?

383
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:46,832
Leslie, no offense.

384
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,450
I've heard a lot
of bad ideas today.

385
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:50,919
- This is the worst.
- April?

386
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:53,172
I would love it if you ran
an insane campaign

387
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:55,341
and basically turned
into the joker.

388
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,459
But that means you probably
shouldn't do it.

389
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:58,544
- Andy?
- I don't know, Leslie.

390
00:13:58,595 --> 00:13:59,928
It seems risky.

391
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,124
And I'd hate to see you
go through another tough fight.

392
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,549
But I could be wrong.

393
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,850
I haven't pooped in three days.

394
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:07,569
Okay, Ron, you have always
given me sage counsel.

395
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:09,571
And your words
carry great influence so...

396
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:10,906
what do you think I should do?

397
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,624
I do not think
you should run again.

398
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:14,020
What the hell do you know,
Dum-Dum?

399
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:16,495
All of you! Look,
this is my only option.

400
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:18,247
I am running again
with or without you.

401
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,549
Leslie, you're running
for office again?

402
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,000
What a great idea!

403
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,252
How can I help?

404
00:14:23,286 --> 00:14:24,520
Ugh...

405
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,271
Well, no one else
any good business ideas.

406
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:31,104
So I decided to
take care of it myself.

407
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:33,620
Talking tissue!

408
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:34,694
Any time you pull one out,

409
00:14:34,738 --> 00:14:36,272
you get a little message
to hype you up.

410
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,840
Blow that nose, playah!

411
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,041
No.

412
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:41,060
This stinks.

413
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:42,695
I'm just gonna have to go back
to my same job

414
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,047
that I've had forever.

415
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,515
Yeah, I get
why you're bummed out.

416
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:46,549
I mean, look at me.

417
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,217
I'm younger than you,

418
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:49,485
and I already have
my own department.

419
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,838
Plus I'm married,
and I make more money than you.

420
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,239
Whatever. You just merged
your department with parks

421
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:54,724
then made up your own title.

422
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:55,858
Yeah.

423
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,326
It's awesome.

424
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:58,344
I'm empty, yo.

425
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,648
Fill me up.

426
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,733
Do that again.

427
00:15:06,136 --> 00:15:09,372
What could you possibly need
at 6:00 in the morning?

428
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:10,686
We couldn't read your writing,

429
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,269
and we need
to know the sex of our baby.

430
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:14,560
I'm watching cartoons
with my son.

431
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:15,662
Daddy!

432
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:17,313
An Elmer Fudd one is on!

433
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,032
Stop it.
Hey, what's up, beautiful?

434
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,850
Jean-Ralphio.
I live in the guesthouse.

435
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:22,151
What do you say
you and I get together

436
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:23,619
in a special way?

437
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:24,671
I-I'm pregnant.

438
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,305
- The more the merrier.
- With my baby.

439
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,440
Well, you can come too,
beautiful.

440
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:28,658
Look at that.

441
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,860
I guess sometimes
I call men "beautiful" too.

442
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:34,347
I guess I'm
open-minded as hell.

443
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:36,532
And I think
you're pretty good-looking.

444
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,007
- Thank you.
- Can you just read that

445
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:39,502
and tell us
what the sex is, please?

446
00:15:39,536 --> 00:15:40,703
Wow.

447
00:15:40,721 --> 00:15:42,004
It looks like
the chicken that wrote this

448
00:15:42,022 --> 00:15:43,523
had a stroke on the paper.

449
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,459
Listen, I-I kind of remember.

450
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,894
But I don't want to say
anything that's wrong.

451
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:49,429
Give me 15 minutes.

452
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,697
I will get dressed.

453
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,665
We'll go down
to my office. Okay.

454
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,467
Well, have a good day
at work today, daddy.

455
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,002
Also,
if you don't know already,

456
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:57,820
there's a malfunction
with the TV,

457
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,305
where it keeps ordering porno,

458
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,673
like, a ton of porno.

459
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,028
Like, how can someone watch
that much porno in one sitting?

460
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:04,364
Only when you're out
of the house.

461
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,746
So if you see it on the bill,
that's why. Okay?

462
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:09,031
"And therefore, with your help,

463
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:11,267
"we can make our future bright.

464
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:14,704
I believe I still have
a lot to offer this city."

465
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,572
I'd swap those two lines.

466
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:20,243
Always helps
to end on the call to action.

467
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,161
I'm sorry if it felt like
everyone piled on.

468
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:23,963
We were just being honest.

469
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:25,448
But if you really
want to do this,

470
00:16:25,482 --> 00:16:26,866
of course we'll support you.

471
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,201
Thank you.

472
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:30,219
I'm sorry I stormed out.

473
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,637
You know, I've been thinking
for weeks of what to get you

474
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:33,740
as a "last day in City Council"
present.

475
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,092
And I finally figured it out.

476
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,176
You remember Jen Barkley,

477
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:38,511
political consultant
and power broker?

478
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:39,812
Hey! Jen!

479
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:40,863
What brings you back to Pawnee?

480
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,281
Ben bought one hour of my time.

481
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,699
I heard you need
some consulting?

482
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:45,735
Well, uh, I guess.

483
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:47,353
I mean, how are you?
How's your family?

484
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,288
Okay, I get paid
$1,200 an hour.

485
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,107
Do you really wanna spend
any of that time

486
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:52,174
talking about my mother

487
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:54,327
and her
19-year-old Korean husband?

488
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,778
Well, that does sound
fascinating.

489
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:56,796
But you're right, let's talk.

490
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,215
Okay.
I'll get the chair.

491
00:17:00,901 --> 00:17:02,835
Ron!

492
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,504
That's how I enter rooms now.
It's more dramatic.

493
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,556
Why did you enter at all?

494
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,957
Because I have some huge news.

495
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:12,478
You're looking at
Pawnee's new business liaison.

496
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:13,763
I don't like French words.

497
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:15,098
I do like the word "business."

498
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:16,382
You may continue.

499
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,850
April created
a new position for herself,

500
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:19,051
and I wanna do the same.

501
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,603
The town could use
more private-sector money

502
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:21,621
after the merger.

503
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:22,905
So as business liaison,

504
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:25,124
I would find companies
looking to move or expand,

505
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,893
and convince them
to do it in Pawnee.

506
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,811
Now this is a good idea.

507
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:30,947
You've come a long way, son.

508
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:33,382
And while I got you here...

509
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,367
talking tissue.

510
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,369
Go for it.

511
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,420
Yo, dog!

512
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,605
Life is what you make of it.

513
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,109
Leave while I'm ahead?
You got it.

514
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:45,795
Clear them sinuses, playboy!

515
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,263
Someone's got the sniffies.

516
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:48,514
Tell your mama you love 'er.

517
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:50,266
Step up
your vitamin "C" game, bro!

518
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,084
So they recall me
after all I've done for them.

519
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,202
Ridiculous.

520
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,353
But Dexhart now
has another sex scandal.

521
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:55,671
Of course he does.

522
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:57,490
And the plan is
I'm gonna run for his seat.

523
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:59,842
Because how do I lose
to a guy like that?

524
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:01,594
- That's a great idea, right?
- It's a terrible idea.

525
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:03,429
I knew it. Wait. What?

526
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,864
First of all, you could lose
to a guy like that.

527
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:07,116
Terrible people defeat
great people all of the time.

528
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,384
I should know.

529
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:09,635
Those terrible people
have paid me so much money,

530
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,154
I have a condo
in every virgin island.

531
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:12,738
Now you might win.

532
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:14,874
You're smart, Ben is smart,
you might win.

533
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:16,342
But why would you want to?

534
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:18,294
Because it's my dream job.

535
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:19,595
Then dream bigger.

536
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:21,564
Look, you love this town.

537
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:22,665
It's being run
by monsters and morons?

538
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:23,950
Get a better job!

539
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,551
Rise above their heads.

540
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:27,670
Affect change at a higher level.

541
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:28,738
Don't be the kid
that graduates high school,

542
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:30,356
hangs out
in the school parking lot.

543
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,158
Be the woman who moves away,

544
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,377
climbs the ladder,
and then confidently comes back

545
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,778
and has sex
with her hot old English teacher

546
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,213
just for kicks.

547
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:38,731
Is that what you did?

548
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:39,782
Yeah. Mr. Baker.

549
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:41,367
Sex was pretty good,
thanks to me.

550
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:43,753
Look, Pawnee
has done you a favor.

551
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:45,221
You've outgrown them.

552
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,556
You've got talent, and
you've got name recognition.

553
00:18:47,574 --> 00:18:50,042
Which means that you have
a bright, wide-open future

554
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:52,178
with a thousand options.

555
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:53,796
State Senate.

556
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,964
Federal jobs.

557
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:56,566
Even congress.

558
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,202
All of these are doable for you.

559
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:02,071
And you can trust me...

560
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:06,959
because I don't care
enough about you to lie.

561
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:10,429
Uh-oh. Oh, time's up.

562
00:19:10,464 --> 00:19:12,414
Okay, if you want
to keep talking,

563
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:13,766
you're gonna have to pay me
1,200 more dollars.

564
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,851
- I just need—
- No, I swear to God,

565
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:18,354
if you say one more word,
you will legally owe me $1,200,

566
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:20,756
and I will sue you.
Let's not end it like that.

567
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:22,525
Okay, great to see you, Leslie.

568
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,809
Those five words are on me.

569
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,028
Should I move this back?
Don't answer it!

570
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:28,097
I don't know
what you're thinking,

571
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:31,784
but you have a press conference
in ten minutes.

572
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:35,459
Well, this is it...

573
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,001
The final moment..

574
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,775
What are you hoping for?

575
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,840
I will honestly be happy
either way.

576
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:42,996
Me too.

577
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,831
Boy or girl,

578
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:46,165
it doesn't matter.

579
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:48,251
Because it will literally be

580
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:50,386
the greatest child
who's ever lived.

581
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:52,672
You swear you have
no preference?

582
00:19:52,706 --> 00:19:53,723
You?

583
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:56,476
Not at all.

584
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,594
Who's ready? Raise your hand.

585
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,980
- It's a boy!
- Yes!

586
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,432
I thought you didn't have
a preference.

587
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:04,317
I didn't. I just really
wanted it to be a boy.

588
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:05,351
Me too.

589
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:07,103
I don't know why.

590
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:08,571
You guys are just so neat.

591
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:10,890
Would you be interested
in adopting my children?

592
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:12,992
They're in their late 20s,
they're terrible.

593
00:20:13,027 --> 00:20:14,577
No? No go?

594
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,580
I ask all my patients.

595
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:19,999
I've gathered you all
here today

596
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:21,334
because I have an announcement,

597
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:26,456
a very big announcement,
about my future.

598
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:30,710
I will be heading to lunch today
with my husband.

599
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:32,211
At JJ's diner.

600
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:34,547
We will eat waffles.

601
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,432
And then we will go home
and make out on our couch.

602
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,101
That is my future.

603
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:41,721
For now.

604
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:46,142
It's been an honor
to serve this town.

605
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:48,945
And I will cherish the memories
forever.

606
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,863
Thank you.

607
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,482
- Ms. Knope!
- There you have it.

608
00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:54,701
A shockingly unshocking
press conference

609
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:56,452
in which
a recently unemployed woman

610
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,454
said nothing of importance.

611
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:59,822
I'm Perd Hapley,

612
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:02,497
and I just realized
I'm not holding my microphone.

613
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:05,661
Jen Barkley telling me I had a future was

614
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,812
the best present I could have got.
Thank you.

615
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:08,780
You're welcome.

616
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,728
But, I did get you one other present

617
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:12,091
to take your mind off all this.

618
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:14,523
Aww, you are the sweetest man in the world.
Where is it?

619
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:17,141
Well, it's not here.

620
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:18,698
We have to go get it.

621
00:21:29,226 --> 00:21:32,286
In times of stress or in moments
of transition,

622
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:35,619
sometimes it can feel like the whole world
is closing in on you.

623
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:40,246
When that happens, you should close
your eyes, take a deep breath,

624
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:43,179
listen to the people that love you
when they're giving advice,

625
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:45,727
and remember what really matters.

626
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,000
And, if you have the ability to go to Paris,
by all means,

627
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:50,236
got to Paris!

628
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:52,039
- I found one!
- Oh, great!

629
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,075
- Mm, right here.
- Yeah?

630
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:12,053
