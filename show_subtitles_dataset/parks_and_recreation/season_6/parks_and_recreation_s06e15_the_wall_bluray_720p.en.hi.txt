1
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:05,921
Okay, Ron. Enough's enough.
Let's talk plans for Diane's baby shower.

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:08,126
- Dear God, woman.
- Three main activities...

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,328
baby bingo, baby food tasting,

4
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:13,581
and my personal favorite...
baby onesie decorating station.

5
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:15,366
I'm gonna make mine
look like an astronaut.

6
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:16,701
What are you doing
up there in space, baby?

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,219
Ah! So cute!
Okay.

8
00:00:18,253 --> 00:00:20,853
I have some gift ideas.
I was looking at a very adorable stroller.

9
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:22,741
We already have a stroller.

10
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:23,959
Oh, shoot. Really?

11
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:25,377
I'm gonna have to think
of something else.

12
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:27,495
Oh, my God, whose baby is that?

13
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:28,997
That would be mine.

14
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:31,282
Guys, get in here!
Ron has a baby!

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,618
- Oh, Ron, cool baby.
- Thank you, Andrew.

16
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:35,670
Everyone,
I'd like to introduce you

17
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:39,341
to my son, John middle name
redacted Swanson.

18
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:41,560
John was born some time ago,

19
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:44,229
weighing multiple pounds
and several ounces.

20
00:00:44,263 --> 00:00:47,131
Much like his father,
he is a fan of silence.

21
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,633
Please keep your voices down.

22
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:50,101
How am I supposed
to keep my voice down

23
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,903
when you had your baby,

24
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:53,521
and you didn't
tell me that you had your baby?

25
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:54,973
Why would you need to know
something like that?

26
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,025
Why would I...
oh, my God.

27
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:58,693
I have not even
sent Diane a gift.

28
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:00,812
She's just walking around,

29
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,447
wondering why I haven't
sent her a gift yet.

30
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,832
Should we do something?

31
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:05,283
Just let her tire herself out.

32
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,502
If you need anything from us,
Ron, please just let us know.

33
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:08,987
Actually there is something.

34
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:11,206
Could one of you please
stop by the pet store

35
00:01:11,257 --> 00:01:13,425
and pick up some fish food
for me?

36
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,210
When did you get a fish?

37
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:26,271
Sync & corrections by honeybunny

38
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,380
Okay, youth committee.

39
00:01:38,414 --> 00:01:40,415
Update on the unity concert.
Madison.

40
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,751
So far, 12 bands have said yes.

41
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,202
And we asked them all
to submit a song

42
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,637
for the new
town anthem contest.

43
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:47,589
I think we should book Orin
as a headliner.

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,090
I think it's a no-brainer.

45
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:52,093
Um, he dislocates his shoulder
to the music of Billy Joel.

46
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:53,428
The Pawnee Journal called it,

47
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,596
"Why would anyone do this?"

48
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,431
Stop suggesting Orin.

49
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,099
Craig, any update
on the art tents?

50
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:00,194
14 local artists have
signed up to show their work.

51
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,103
It was going to be 15,
but then this one guy

52
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:03,938
described himself
as "Jackson Pollock-esque"

53
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,573
and I told him that's
finger painting for adults

54
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:06,941
and I hate it!

55
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,577
The Pawnee-Eagleton merger
has made for a rough year,

56
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,496
both for me and for the town.

57
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,398
But if I can pull off
this unity concert

58
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,784
and prove that this merger
was a success,

59
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:20,288
Pawnee might once again
tolerate-slash-ignore me.

60
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,407
I know that sounds bad,
but for a politician

61
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,742
it's pretty much
the best-case scenario.

62
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,711
You guys might as well be
a pile of leaves

63
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,279
because you're about
to get blown away.

64
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:32,517
I have booked a meeting with
none other than Grant Larson.

65
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:36,254
- No one knows who that is?
- Um, I do.

66
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:38,023
"Grant Larson,"
otherwise known as Elton John.

67
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,307
Congratulations, Leslie.

68
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:40,892
No, Grant Larson
is the director

69
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,428
of the Midwest branch
of the National Park Service.

70
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:45,263
He's basically
the Liam Bonneville

71
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:47,615
of the Midwest.

72
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,950
Liam Bonneville?

73
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,735
The department of the interior's
resident bad boy?

74
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,204
He's basically the Tim Dweck...
Okay, never mind.

75
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,657
I have asked Grant
to declare Eagleton Hills

76
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,375
a national park

77
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,327
as the grand finale
of our unity concert.

78
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:00,795
Great idea, Leslie.

79
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,080
And with that update,

80
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:03,965
the Pawnee new founder's day
unity concert

81
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,084
is now officially...

82
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,002
ahead of schedule!

83
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,473
And that banner unfurling
marks the 100th time

84
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:15,060
that one of my projects
has been...

85
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,627
ahead of schedule.

86
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,763
This is your chance
to put your names

87
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:22,984
on the Pawnee unity concert,
the biggest event of 2014...

88
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:24,602
besides the unveiling
of Tricia's new highlights.

89
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:27,188
You think I wouldn't notice?
You look fly as hell, girl!

90
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,708
This unity concert
needs corporate sponsorship,

91
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,694
so Ben and I are meeting
with local bigwigs.

92
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,363
I'm gonna do what I do best...
lock down deals.

93
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:37,949
And dork-asaurus over here is
gonna handle the boring stuff.

94
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:42,337
You said you genuinely valued
my business acumen.

95
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:45,173
Also, I'm your boss.

96
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,791
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

97
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:48,826
You're the cutest
little boo-bear I've ever seen.

98
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:50,462
You are the world's
most adorable baby

99
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,046
and I love you!

100
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,165
You are so freaking precious!

101
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:55,504
Look what Gayle made
for the baby.

102
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,969
It says "Property
of Pawnee government."

103
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,387
Isn't that adorable?

104
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:02,774
Come on, John.

105
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:06,561
Jeez.

106
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:07,729
Here we are...

107
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,181
the park that borders
Pawnee and Eagleton.

108
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,733
This is the perfect place
for the press conference

109
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,151
to announce our unity concert.

110
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:14,865
People are gonna clap,
they're gonna cheer.

111
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,322
Today might be the day
that I finally crowd surf.

112
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,690
I should probably
empty my pockets just in case.

113
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,242
Hey, one question.

114
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,077
Um, where do you think
you're gonna stand,

115
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,431
in front of the graffiti
that says "Pawnee, you suck,"

116
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:28,216
or "Go home, Eagleton snobs"?

117
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,834
I painted over that graffiti
a week ago.

118
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,169
These people are the worst!

119
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,054
I cannot announce
a unity concert

120
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:34,472
in front of a picture
of a bald eagle

121
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,840
giving the middle finger.

122
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:37,091
Yeah, you probably
wanna stand to the side

123
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,393
so people can see it.

124
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:40,378
You know, why do we even
have this wall?

125
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:42,564
We're supposed to be
uniting the two towns,

126
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:45,550
and this literally
divides them.

127
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:46,768
We should just knock it down.

128
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,604
On it, boss.

129
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:50,855
Ahh!

130
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,073
Ow.

131
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:54,526
The kool-aid guy
makes it look so easy.

132
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,896
In the time I've worked here,

133
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,331
I've taken great pains

134
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,283
to see as little
of this building as possible.

135
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:05,620
Turns out the third floor
is silent, empty,

136
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:08,673
and completely free
of government work.

137
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,758
I can't think of anything
more beautiful

138
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,594
to share with my son.

139
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,430
If I had a toolbox

140
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:18,349
I could take care
of that faulty radiator.

141
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,719
Ooh!
This place is a paradise!

142
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:25,139
Nicely done, Tom.
We have 15 sponsorship offers.

143
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,108
Make that 16.
Mitch Savner.

144
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:28,926
- Savner Bleaches and Chemicals!
- That's it.

145
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,645
You guys make my favorite
teeth-whitening strips...

146
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:31,762
pearlies for girlies.

147
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,114
It's unisex.

148
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:34,816
The cartoon princess
on the label says so.

149
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,767
I'll sponsor your concert.

150
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,102
But I'm also looking
to invest in other ventures.

151
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,537
I have a feeling
a bright guy like you

152
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,771
has some ideas of his own.

153
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,790
I may have a few eggs
ready to hatch

154
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:44,108
in the personal idea nest.

155
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,994
Why don't you come
to my office tomorrow

156
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,445
and pitch me your hottest idea?

157
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:49,947
Perfect!
I'll see you then.

158
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:51,115
Oh, that's pretty cool.

159
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,800
It's all happening, Ben.

160
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,053
Soon I'll have a new career,
new crib, new friends.

161
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,256
If all goes well, this may be
one of the last times

162
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,141
I ever have to speak to you.

163
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,509
Come with me, I need your help.

164
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:05,346
Thank you so much, everyone,
for coming.

165
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,797
And a special thank you
to the city council

166
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:08,299
for their support.

167
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:09,634
I was told there'd be
a free barbecue buffet?

168
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:11,686
Just take some beef jerky
and... hush!

169
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:15,907
This spring we will be holding
a massive unity concert

170
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:19,310
to commemorate the merger
between Pawnee and Eagleton.

171
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:21,829
This three-day
music and arts festival

172
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:25,283
will end on a day we will call
"New Founder's Day,"

173
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,168
an official beginning
to our new town.

174
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:28,870
A few years ago,

175
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,039
Eagleton put up this wall
along the border.

176
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,460
Now it is time
to tear down this wall.

177
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,513
In the name of unity,

178
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,599
I have given some former
Eagletonians the first strike.

179
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,434
Take it away, guys.

180
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,523
This is such a great day
for...

181
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:49,891
Bees!

182
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,225
Bees!
Oh!

183
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,226
Nobody panic!

184
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,178
Ohhh, noooo!

185
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,364
Ah! It stung me
in the eyeball!

186
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:59,317
Oh, man, this is amazing, man.

187
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,818
The stupid Eagletonians

188
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:03,237
are totally getting the pwned
by these bees.

189
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,729
I'm gonna send this
straight to tosh.

190
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,458
[Laughing]
Ow, [bleep]! [Bleep]!

191
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,494
Don't worry, babe,
I'll protect you.

192
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:10,962
I got stung once, I'm immune.

193
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,464
Go ahead and sting me, bees.
It does nothing.

194
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,666
Leslie, it appears that most of the people
that were stung were from Eagleton.

195
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,073
How did you pull that off?

196
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,525
I didn't pull anything off.

197
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,577
The Eagletonians were simply
closest to the wall.

198
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:26,863
Plus, one Pawneean was stung...
in his mouth

199
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:28,617
because he was laughing
at the Eagletonians.

200
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,501
How did you get your bees
into the wall,

201
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:33,737
and how long did it take
to plan

202
00:07:33,755 --> 00:07:36,072
this hilarious bee prank
on Eagleton?

203
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,875
They were not my bees, Trodd.

204
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,511
And for the last time
this was not a prank.

205
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:43,597
I did not know
that bees were in that wall.

206
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,015
I mean, in fact
you should treat this

207
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:46,266
like a public service
announcement.

208
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,935
Everybody... should check
their walls for bees.

209
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,854
Nice try, prank queen.
Probably bees in there.

210
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,522
Okay, that's all the time
I have.

211
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:53,857
What else can you do
with your bees?

212
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,108
Leslie, what's your next prank?

213
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:56,309
Ooh.

214
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:58,278
Leslie, Grant Larson
is on the phone

215
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,613
from the National Park Service.

216
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:00,947
I cannot meet with him
right now.

217
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,265
We are in crisis mode, okay?

218
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,401
Larry, just tell him
I need to reschedule

219
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,370
because I am trying
to fix my bee hole disaster.

220
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,988
- Okeydokey.
- Wait! No, wait!

221
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,740
No!
Larry, don't tell him that.

222
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:11,375
Don't mention my bee hole.

223
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:13,210
Just as we suspected, John.

224
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,445
We repaired
the valve stem seal,

225
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,447
and now all that remains
is to tighten down

226
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:19,883
this packing nut.

227
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,802
And... that should do it.

228
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,170
Can we help you?

229
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:26,139
No. We have everything
under control.

230
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,957
My crew's redoing
this whole floor.

231
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,793
We're the only people
allowed up here right now.

232
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,646
Well, proceed with your work.
You won't notice us at all.

233
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,348
We're gonna be kinda loud.

234
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,318
My son is several weeks old.

235
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,604
He's quite familiar
with the sound of power tools.

236
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:45,475
Okay, how about this one...
Lasik for fingernails?

237
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:48,311
Cut your fingernails once,
never have to cut 'em again.

238
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,480
All we need
is a complicated laser

239
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:51,915
I have no idea how to build.

240
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,367
- Seems impossible.
- All right.

241
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:57,704
Uh-oh! "Saltweens!"
Saltines for tweens.

242
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:00,006
Seems... unnecessary?

243
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,509
The only business idea I have

244
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,177
that's even remotely
fleshed out is a restaurant.

245
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:05,462
No way.

246
00:09:05,496 --> 00:09:06,997
Restaurants
were ranked number one

247
00:09:07,031 --> 00:09:09,549
in Accounting Magazine's
"Riskiest Businesses" issue.

248
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,761
That was their last issue
before they folded, actually.

249
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:13,053
Magazines are also very risky.

250
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:14,387
I can't believe
an angel investor

251
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,672
floated down from the heavens,

252
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,107
and I don't even have
anything to pitch him.

253
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,025
Come on, you must've had
one good business idea.

254
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,527
You're 52 years old!

255
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,979
No, I'm not.
But I do have an idea.

256
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,281
It's air-tight.

257
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:26,283
But I have to warn you,
it's not super sexy.

258
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,869
- What is it?
- Okay, listen up.

259
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:31,621
You would be the middleman
between dry cleaners

260
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:34,241
and the companies
that sell chemicals...

261
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,992
to dry cleaners.

262
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,378
- Wow!
- Right?

263
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,299
You're right, man.
That is not sexy.

264
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,000
Leslie Knope's little stunt

265
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:45,752
put three people
in the hospital.

266
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:48,421
This bee incident
is just the latest assault

267
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,474
coming from the Pawnee side
of this merger.

268
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,042
Mike Patterson is Eagleton's
most tenacious reporter.

269
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,411
When he sinks his teeth
into something,

270
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:55,812
he's like a dog with a bone!

271
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,147
Oh, my God!

272
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,548
You can't lean in to whisper
and then yell.

273
00:09:58,566 --> 00:09:59,683
That's not fair.

274
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:01,485
This merger is so fragile,

275
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,819
everyone is on edge,

276
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:04,554
and no one is talking
about the unity concert.

277
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,273
Why would anybody think
that was a prank?

278
00:10:06,324 --> 00:10:07,691
So sad.
People will believe anything.

279
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:08,885
It was a prank though, right?

280
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:10,443
No more press, okay?

281
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:12,279
You just have to lay low
for a while.

282
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,947
I promise it'll all blow over.

283
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:16,283
April, your competence
and your levelheadedness

284
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,451
is very moving to me,
and I will follow your advice

285
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:19,870
right after
I go to the hospital

286
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:21,338
and apologize to every victim
in person.

287
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,540
- Fine, but no cameras.
- Fine, I won't bring any.

288
00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:26,543
Aghh! I can't handle
all this fighting.

289
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:28,512
It's like Thanksgiving 2004
all over again!

290
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,463
Don't even ask!

291
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:32,933
Somebody follow me,
I'm distraught!

292
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:36,252
Who's a big guy?

293
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,521
Man, forget about working.

294
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:40,190
I just wanna stare
at this baby all day.

295
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,859
What is the nature
of your work on this floor?

296
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,261
Total redo... new floors,
fixtures, plumbing.

297
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,696
How long will it take?

298
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,598
Six to eight weeks.

299
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:49,900
Deal.

300
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,769
I will do all this work for you
in the time allotted.

301
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:55,038
Just have your tools
and materials brought up here.

302
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,272
Are you crazy?

303
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,730
This is enough work
for a whole crew.

304
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,142
I'm sure the government
believed you

305
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,710
when you told them that,

306
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:04,447
and I tip my cap to you for
profiting off their ignoe.

307
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:06,550
But I'm offering you
two months paid vacation

308
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:09,803
and the ability to take credit
for my work,

309
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,639
which will be flawless.

310
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:16,977
Okay.
Guys, let's go!

311
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,929
I got all help I'll need
right here.

312
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,265
Okay, this is
the really exciting part.

313
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:25,852
We buy tetrachloroethylene
at $1.60 a gallon,

314
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,188
but we sell it back
at 2.38 a gallon.

315
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:29,773
Now I know
what you're thinking.

316
00:11:29,807 --> 00:11:32,692
What if it's a cleaner
who wants to buy glycol ethers?

317
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:34,778
Ben, stop!

318
00:11:34,812 --> 00:11:36,312
This is so boring!

319
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,647
This is like listening
to a TED talk

320
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:38,832
by the color beige.

321
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,585
Look, I know this idea
doesn't excite you.

322
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:43,920
But I promise it'll make you
a lot of money.

323
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,656
Well, I sold tons
of awesome stuff.

324
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:48,041
Guess it makes sense
my next challenge

325
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:50,377
is to sell something
mind-numbingly dull.

326
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:52,328
Dull?

327
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:55,465
Does this look dull to you?

328
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,801
Ahhhh.

329
00:11:57,835 --> 00:11:59,853
I'm so incredibly sorry.

330
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,055
That's very kind of you,
Ms. Knope.

331
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:04,340
I hope you look a lot
less gross very soon.

332
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,143
Hey!

333
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:10,530
Thanks for coming, Knope.
I knew we were besties.

334
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,484
What do you got in there for me,
some dirty mags?

335
00:12:12,516 --> 00:12:15,018
No! These gift baskets
are for innocent victims...

336
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:16,820
not for jerks who got stung

337
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:18,405
because they were laughing
at other people's pain.

338
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:19,572
Whatever.

339
00:12:19,624 --> 00:12:21,190
Got a lotta filth
in my kindle anyway.

340
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,826
We can just hang.

341
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,794
- Wanna come up?
- What?

342
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:25,862
- We gotta get this.
- Roll camera.

343
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,580
Tell me when.
Is my hair okay?

344
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:29,049
We good?

345
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,051
Welcome to Eagleton Now,
with Mike Patterson.

346
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:33,003
We're live
ambushing Leslie Knope

347
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:35,038
who's in the middle
of a crass publicity stunt,

348
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:36,623
shoving cameras cameras
into the faces

349
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,258
of these poor, injured victims.

350
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,261
These are your cameras.
This is not a publicity stunt.

351
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:43,096
I just came here by myself

352
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:45,398
to apologize to all
the Eagletonians who got stung.

353
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:48,318
Really? Because all we see
is you talking to your friend,

354
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,987
known Eagleton hater
Jeremy Jamm.

355
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:53,156
Excuse me, Mike.
That's, uh, best friend.

356
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,191
Pawneeans and Eagletonians
need to find a way

357
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,410
to come together
and bury the hatchet.

358
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,562
It doesn't matter
who bailed out who,

359
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,281
or who seceded from you.

360
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:02,666
Awesome idea, Lezzie.

361
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,769
As a matter of fact I say
we should secede from Eagleton!

362
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:08,305
Whose dumbass idea was it
for them to merge anyway?

363
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,723
Mine. It was my idea.

364
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:11,057
You heard it here first.

365
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:13,443
Self-proclaimed dumbass
Leslie Knope

366
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:15,028
and councilman Jeremy Jamm

367
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,980
are spearheading
a Pawnee secession movement.

368
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:18,865
And I, for one, am sick of it.

369
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,683
All right, you know what,
Eagleton, enough!

370
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:21,985
Get these cameras outta here!

371
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,154
Don't touch my camera,
you Pawnee animal!

372
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:25,488
Name-calling, huh?

373
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:26,906
Classy move, douche bag.

374
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:28,291
Oh! All right.

375
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:29,826
Is that how you wanna play?

376
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,878
- Yeah! Come on!
- No fighting in a hospital.

377
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,552
There shouldn't be
fighting in a hospital!

378
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:34,914
Wish I had my ninja stars!

379
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:38,168
Oh, my God!
What's happening?

380
00:13:38,202 --> 00:13:39,419
Oh!

381
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,475
Mother... puncher!

382
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,024
Hey, girl.
What up?

383
00:13:45,264 --> 00:13:46,185
What are you wearing?

384
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,182
It's to distract people
from my black eye.

385
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,017
See?
It's working.

386
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:54,255
Cool. Um...
well, there is some good news.

387
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:57,975
That Mike Patterson guy's show
just aired, everyone is angry,

388
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,194
and Jamm is introducing
a secession bill

389
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,525
at the next
city council meeting.

390
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,231
- How is any of that good news?
- It's not.

391
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:05,366
I just wanted you to have
a brief moment of happiness

392
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,534
before you got sadder.

393
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:09,337
Those jerks that hate the merger
are a minority.

394
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:11,251
They're just shouting louder
than everyone else.

395
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:14,759
I'm sorry this town keeps being
stupid and letting you down.

396
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:15,927
It sucks.

397
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:17,545
It's okay, April.
It's fine.

398
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:18,796
You know, it's a challenge.

399
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,934
It's just like a big, fun...

400
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:24,668
stinking turd nugget.
It sucks.

401
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:26,003
You're right, everything sucks.

402
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,522
Everything I try
with this merger backfires.

403
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:31,726
I wonder what other
excellent surprise lies in store

404
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,194
for Leslie Knope.

405
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,228
Leslie, Grant Larson
from the National Park Service

406
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,513
is here for your meeting.

407
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:37,732
Excellent.

408
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:40,201
Now I shall meet
with a very important person

409
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:42,236
whilst sporting
a gruesome shiner.

410
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:44,071
Hey, you're also wearing
a tie-dye t-shirt.

411
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:47,241
Oh, yes! I am!

412
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:48,876
Wonderful!

413
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,211
Mitch!
Thanks for meeting me.

414
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:51,379
My pleasure.

415
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:53,697
It's not often
that I see someone

416
00:14:53,715 --> 00:14:56,083
with your sparkle and passion.

417
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:58,135
That's what makes
businesses work...

418
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,503
passion!

419
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:02,223
So, Mr. Haverford,
let's get to it.

420
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:05,476
What idea
are you passionate about?

421
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:10,547
I've got two words for you...

422
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:11,983
"Tom's Bistro,"

423
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:14,852
an old-fashioned,
old-world Italian restaurant.

424
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:17,822
Classy, authentic ambience
in a small-town setting.

425
00:15:17,856 --> 00:15:19,223
Why does that say

426
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:21,909
"dry cleaning chemical
transactional holding company?"

427
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:24,945
Ben! You brought
the wrong easel. God!

428
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:27,698
Can't take this guy anywhere.
Let me paint you a picture.

429
00:15:27,732 --> 00:15:29,500
Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry.

430
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:32,003
I had to reschedule.
It's been kind of a hectic week.

431
00:15:32,037 --> 00:15:33,537
- What happened to your face?
- It doesn't matter.

432
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:36,374
I would like to apply
to turn some of our new land

433
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:37,842
into a national park.

434
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:39,460
I read your request,
Ms. Knope,

435
00:15:39,511 --> 00:15:41,962
and I'm sorry,
but we can't make that happen.

436
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:43,414
Great.

437
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:45,749
Well, this week just keeps
getting better and better.

438
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,885
Thank you for coming by
and plunging a dagger

439
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,937
into my already-bleeding
corpse.

440
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:52,923
I came here
because I wanted to meet you.

441
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:55,359
I've actually wanted to meet you
since before you called me.

442
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:57,361
- Really? You know who I am?
- Yes.

443
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:59,814
You're the person
who wrote this.

444
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:01,982
You read my proposal
to clean up the Pawnee river?

445
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:03,367
I wrote this two years ago.

446
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,820
Got shuffled around
in interior for a year and half.

447
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:08,989
Liam Bonneville actually used it
to humiliate staffers, but...

448
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,409
he's kind of a bad boy.

449
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:12,827
Liam B...

450
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:15,079
- You don't have to tell me!
- This report is legendary.

451
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,797
It's easily
the most thoroughly research

452
00:16:16,832 --> 00:16:19,383
and passionate grant request
I've ever seen.

453
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:22,887
Wow, you have no idea
how meaningful it is

454
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:24,221
to hear you say that.

455
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,589
But you're a little late.

456
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:27,141
The river cleanup's
well underway.

457
00:16:27,175 --> 00:16:29,310
This is bigger
than the river cleanup.

458
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:31,011
We're opening a new office
in Chicago.

459
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:32,480
I spent the last few weeks

460
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:33,898
reading about you
and your career

461
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,683
and I think that you're
the perfect person to run it.

462
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,569
Leslie, would you like
to run a branch

463
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:40,637
of the National Park Service?

464
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:44,658
Tom's Bistro will have
all the classic elements,

465
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,026
but with modern twists...

466
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:48,779
an oak bar, live music,

467
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:51,232
and Sunday brunch
with scrambled eggs so fluffy

468
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:53,250
they'll be like little pillows
for your bacon.

469
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:55,870
Bacon pillows.
I like the sound of that.

470
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:57,254
But I have to say,

471
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,706
restaurants
are incredibly risky.

472
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:02,159
Most of them
are dead on arrival.

473
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:04,378
We're well-aware of that,

474
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:06,680
but believe me,
Tom has thought this out.

475
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:08,682
See, there's plenty
of real estate available

476
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:11,051
in the old Eagleton
part of town.

477
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:13,471
And with the recent closures,
there's massive demand

478
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:17,108
for affordable dining
that feels high-end.

479
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:19,527
Okay!

480
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,946
As long as you're running,
I'm in.

481
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,814
Amazing!

482
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:25,065
Hey, kid...

483
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:27,351
your boss here
sure knows his stuff.

484
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:35,993
Ron.
What are you doing here?

485
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:38,129
The most important
government work I've ever done...

486
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:40,697
sanding rat urine stains
out of this floor.

487
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,133
What are you doing here?

488
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,884
I come here to think sometimes.

489
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,669
By myself.

490
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:48,005
- But now that you're here...
- Damn it.

491
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:49,507
I am going to speak to you
very vaguely

492
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,008
about a problem that I have,

493
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:53,594
and you cannot ask me any
questions or details about it.

494
00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:57,014
That is my ideal conversation,
aside from no conversation.

495
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,482
But that feels unlikely.

496
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:00,884
Look, you know how much
I love Pawnee.

497
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:04,071
But the more I try to fix it
the more people fight me.

498
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:06,073
They call me names,
they recall me,

499
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:08,058
they try to kill the merger.

500
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:10,444
They literally punch me
in the face.

501
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:13,614
And yet every time
I contemplate leaving,

502
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:17,535
just walking away
once and for all,

503
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,037
I just can't do it.

504
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:24,741
What is wrong with me?

505
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,578
Yesterday, I fixed
that old steam radiator.

506
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:29,880
Threaded a new valve
into the side,

507
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:31,549
removed the handle
from the base,

508
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,101
unscrewed the packing nut
from the stem.

509
00:18:34,135 --> 00:18:37,087
This subpar toolbox
only had one wrench,

510
00:18:37,105 --> 00:18:39,523
so I was lucky
it was a three-quarters

511
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:40,808
or I'd have been screwed.

512
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,526
Yeah, man, you are lucky.

513
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:43,777
Come on, Ron.

514
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:44,979
What the hell?
I need your help.

515
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,780
By the time I was done,

516
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:49,700
this 100-year-old piece
of American-made cast iron

517
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:52,069
was singing like a bird.

518
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:54,938
Now... to most people,
this story would seem boring.

519
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:57,274
That's ridiculous.
It's a story about a radiator.

520
00:18:57,292 --> 00:19:00,110
But to me,
it was immensely satisfying

521
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:03,547
because I enjoy
fixing radiators.

522
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:06,917
You like fixing this town,
Leslie, you always have.

523
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:10,170
You know it's an uphill battle,
but you love the struggle.

524
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:12,640
I would also add
that you've already done

525
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:14,508
a hell of a lot
to make this town better,

526
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,344
and people
like this young man here

527
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:19,296
will benefit
from your hard work.

528
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:21,682
- He is a beautiful boy.
- He's quite a looker.

529
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:23,851
Thank you, Ron.

530
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:28,522
- What's that?
- Nothing.

531
00:19:28,573 --> 00:19:31,325
Clearing my throat.

532
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,463
I've been thinking about your offer.

533
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:39,402
And I have to say I can't think
of one single reason

534
00:19:39,427 --> 00:19:40,560
not to take it.

535
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:41,961
That's great!

536
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:43,397
I'll start drawing up
the paperwork.

537
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,599
I'm sorry, I meant...

538
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,517
because I can think
of a lot of reasons

539
00:19:47,568 --> 00:19:48,802
not to take it.

540
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,971
Okay, wow, that's very
misleading phraseology.

541
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:53,356
I'm sorry.

542
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,275
It's an amazing offer
and I'm very interested,

543
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:57,778
but if I'm going
to leave Pawnee...

544
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,780
I need to know
it's gonna be okay without me.

545
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:03,333
And I won't know until I finish
what I've started.

546
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,785
When do you need your answer?

547
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:06,703
Well, the gears
of federal government

548
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,988
grind pretty slowly,
so you have a little time.

549
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:12,426
But we can't wait forever.
I'll be in touch.

550
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,511
Great. Thank you.

551
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:16,296
That's not your hand.
Here it is.

552
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,132
Sorry, my depth perception
is totally screwed up.

553
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,468
Really happy that worked out
for you, Tom,

554
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,937
but you kinda sold me out
back there.

555
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:25,439
I know, and I'm sorry.

556
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:28,225
But Mitch asked me
what I was passionate about,

557
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:30,343
and honestly
I'm never gonna be passionate

558
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:31,695
about dry cleaning chemicals.

559
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,196
To each his own, I guess.

560
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,698
I know opening a restaurant
is risky,

561
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:36,116
but I can make this work.

562
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,818
I know I can!

563
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:40,487
Then count me in
as the second investor

564
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:41,738
in Tom's Bistro.

565
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:42,873
Thanks, man.

566
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,358
I know this is
a symbolic gesture,

567
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:47,360
but my investor floor
is $1,000.

568
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:48,895
So as of now,
you own zero shares.

569
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:50,614
Cool!
Thanks for clearing that up.

570
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,398
Now go do work,
or I will fire you.

571
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,617
I'm not kidding.

572
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:55,401
Yep!

573
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:58,872
Oh, look, John.
It's red pine.

574
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:01,591
They were gonna put
flecked linoleum

575
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,644
over this beautifully preserved
knotty red pine.

576
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,131
Most people in this world,
John, are ass[bleep].

577
00:21:08,182 --> 00:21:09,633
This is the best day
I've ever spent

578
00:21:09,684 --> 00:21:11,301
in a government building,

579
00:21:11,352 --> 00:21:13,553
and luckily my son
was here to share it with me.

580
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:15,388
He now has that satisfied look

581
00:21:15,422 --> 00:21:18,591
that only comes
with the pride of labor.

582
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:19,475
Or he pooped.

583
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,379
Either way, well done, John.

584
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:32,611
