1
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:17,836
Okay, here's the text
I added a few more jokes,

2
00:00:17,956 --> 00:00:19,672
slamming Eagleton at the end.

3
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:20,974
Mmm.
That's the sexiest thing

4
00:00:20,976 --> 00:00:22,308
you've ever said to me.

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,842
I'm so glad you're on my team.

6
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:25,095
Are you sure you wanna
attack 'em

7
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:26,246
at this press conference?

8
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:27,296
It's a friendly wager

9
00:00:27,298 --> 00:00:29,149
on a high school
basketball game.

10
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm losing
the recall election, Ben.

11
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:32,068
Slamming Eagleton
is the easiest way

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,336
to score some points.

13
00:00:33,338 --> 00:00:35,255
Look. Am I proud of it?
Yes.

14
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:36,556
Because Eagleton sucks.

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:37,941
But is it the classiest move?

16
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:39,492
Yes, because Eagleton sucks.

17
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:40,610
Would I do it again?

18
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:42,262
Yes, because Eagleton sucks.

19
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:43,463
This year, we get to host

20
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:45,815
the Pawnee-Eagleton
tip-off classic.

21
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:49,135
That awful human being
is Ingrid de Forest.

22
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:51,087
She's a city councilor
from Eagleton.

23
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:52,856
She thinks she's so great
because she won

24
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:54,791
the Miss Indiana
Beauty Pageant.

25
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:57,393
Last year.
While she was in office.

26
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,062
And pregnant.

27
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:00,513
As always,
we would like to make

28
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:02,248
a friendly wager with Eagleton.

29
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,817
If you beat us this year,

30
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:05,985
we will give you
a basket of apples

31
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:07,603
from our Pawnee orchard.

32
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:09,139
Ew, pesticide.
Yuck.

33
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:10,890
Oh, no, these
are pesticide-free.

34
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:12,559
I ate one of these
for breakfast this morning,

35
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:13,943
and I found a worm in it.

36
00:01:13,945 --> 00:01:17,413
So, I bet somebody feels
pretty stupid right now.

37
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:20,467
Well, Leslie, I think
we had similar ideas.

38
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:23,153
If you win,
Eagleton will give you

39
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,871
this basket of oranges.

40
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:27,290
Of course,
it's silly to compare

41
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:29,926
apples and oranges,
but what the heck.

42
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:31,611
These are made
of Swarovski crystal,

43
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,530
and they're worth $700,000.

44
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:35,932
Leslie, you're down 15 points

45
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:37,851
in the latest poll
for the recall election.

46
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,736
What can you do
to make up the deficit?

47
00:01:39,738 --> 00:01:41,488
I'll tell you what I'd do
if I was an Eagletonian.

48
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,972
I'd pop a Xanax

49
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:44,724
and ask my butler
to help me out.

50
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:48,778
I mean, I'm not saying
that Eagletonians

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,879
are out of touch.

52
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,464
But when you tell 'em it's time

53
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:52,899
to change their oil, they ask,

54
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,951
"Extra virgin
or white truffle?"

55
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:57,670
Thanks, guys.
I'll see ya at the game.

56
00:01:57,672 --> 00:01:59,139
Unless, of course,
you're an Eagletonian,

57
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:00,807
and then you'll be too busy
polishing your monocle

58
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:02,425
at the caviar store.

59
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:04,110
Knope out.

60
00:02:05,163 --> 00:02:06,246
Yeah.

61
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:17,140
Sync & corrections by honeybunny

62
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:29,218
Who or what is Penny Saver?

63
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,671
It's a free circular
with a bunch of coupons in it.

64
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,806
This was sent to Ron Swanson

65
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,191
at Diane's address,

66
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:37,660
where I've lived
for less than a month.

67
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:39,329
How is that possible?

68
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,831
This is an extreme invasion
of privacy.

69
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,701
The right to privacy
is very important to me.

70
00:02:44,703 --> 00:02:47,170
My family has had
a single P.O. box

71
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:48,855
for several generations.

72
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:51,324
We only ever subscribe
to two magazines,

73
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:53,960
Reader's Digest and Ebony.

74
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:55,878
Ebony was due
to a clerical error,

75
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,165
but it ended up being
an interesting year of reading.

76
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,616
I don't know how this
was delivered to me,

77
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,468
but it cannot happen again.

78
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,770
How can I stop it?

79
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:06,206
Mm. Donna is great
with this sort of thing.

80
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,308
She got me off the
Williams-Sonoma mailing list,

81
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,959
but then I just
signed back up again.

82
00:03:09,961 --> 00:03:11,144
Hooked on their oven mitts.

83
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,595
I need my mitts on those mitts.

84
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:14,247
Let me know the second
Donna returns.

85
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,531
According to her Twitter feed,

86
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,300
she got coffee
five minutes ago.

87
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:19,152
Wait, now she's Ustreaming
her walk back.

88
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:23,790
She should be here
in three, two, one.

89
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,391
Hey, hey.

90
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:28,494
Hashtag quest for coffee,
blowin' up my timeline.

91
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:29,963
You get my snapchat about it?

92
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,965
- No.
- What?

93
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:34,234
There it is.

94
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:36,986
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- I did.

95
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,838
- Think fast.
- Oh, my God.

96
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,123
Hey, Dr. Buttons...

97
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,909
I mean, my old calculator.

98
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,060
It doesn't have a name.

99
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:45,245
Why did you throw this at me?

100
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:46,379
I just got off the phone
with our old boss

101
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,530
from Indianapolis,

102
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:48,781
and apparently there may be
some sort of

103
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:50,650
a budget problem in Eagleton.

104
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:53,152
He asked if maybe you and I

105
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:56,389
wouldn't have a look.
You in?

106
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:58,775
Butch Count-sidy
and the Sum-dance Kid,

107
00:03:58,777 --> 00:04:00,743
together again.

108
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,732
- Hmm.
- Auditing bros!

109
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:09,485
Yeah, and auditing sistah.
Let's do this.

110
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:10,637
Oh, you're coming?

111
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,838
If there's a problem
with Eagleton,

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,889
I wanna be there.

113
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:14,190
That's like a dream come true.

114
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:16,526
Besides, I have a new routine
I'm working on.

115
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,127
Kind of like
a Jeff Foxworthy-type thing,

116
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,345
but about Eagleton.

117
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:20,596
If you make your omelet

118
00:04:20,598 --> 00:04:22,982
out of Faberge eggs,

119
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:25,785
- you just might...
- Be an Eagletonian.

120
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,037
Yippee! Road trip!

121
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,605
Who's excited to go
to Bloomington?

122
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:30,990
Is that where you're gonna sit?

123
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:33,042
I'm driving.
Where else would I sit?

124
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:34,443
Trunk.

125
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:36,079
I helped April get
into vet school in Bloomington

126
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,380
and today's her orientation,

127
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:39,265
so we're taking
a little road trip.

128
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:40,700
While I'm there,
I'm also gonna pick up

129
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:42,184
an organic baby blanket.

130
00:04:42,186 --> 00:04:44,170
I would get one in Pawnee,
but fun fact...

131
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:47,690
our only baby store is attached
to a chemical refinery.

132
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:50,777
I made a special road trip
mix CD for us.

133
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:53,780
- I hope you like Tori Amos.
- Oh, cool.

134
00:04:56,884 --> 00:04:59,302
It really is a pleasure
to see you

135
00:04:59,304 --> 00:05:00,570
in this context, Ingrid.

136
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:01,621
Say cheese.

137
00:05:01,623 --> 00:05:03,806
Damn it.
You look beautiful.

138
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:05,641
Can you give us
a little more information

139
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:07,360
surrounding the deficits
that you're running this year?

140
00:05:07,362 --> 00:05:08,695
Ooh, gosh.

141
00:05:08,697 --> 00:05:11,314
We don't really like
to talk about

142
00:05:11,316 --> 00:05:12,465
money.

143
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,133
We find a little gauche.

144
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:15,802
This is a budget meeting.

145
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:17,487
Well, most of our files
are in these boxes

146
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,538
if you really wanna take a look

147
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,456
at how much that we've spent.

148
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,457
Why don't we just dig in

149
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,542
and see what we're up against?

150
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:24,010
Yes. And thank you.

151
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:26,662
We really appreciate your help.

152
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:28,614
Are you tipping me?

153
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:31,601
Is that 100... Euros?

154
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:34,503
People ought to have
the right to be left alone.

155
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,873
I wanna get completely
off the grid.

156
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,124
That's crazy talk.

157
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:39,442
I live for the grid.

158
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:41,711
It's where I meet
40% of my jump-offs.

159
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:42,895
And if you're off the grid,

160
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,046
how are you gonna post photos

161
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:45,481
of the dope food
at restaurants you're at

162
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:47,116
and all the cool places
you're stuntin' in?

163
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,201
Food is for eating.

164
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:50,753
Places are for being.
End of discussion.

165
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,305
Don't leave the grid, Ron.
The grid is the best.

166
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:54,774
If anything, you need
to get more on the grid.

167
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,610
Grid, grid, grid,
grid, grid, grid, grid...

168
00:05:57,612 --> 00:05:58,828
If you help me
get off the grid,

169
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,780
I will let both of you
go home early.

170
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:05,017
No grid, no grid,
no grid, no grid.

171
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:06,185
All right, so you have

172
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:07,553
everything you need
for orientation?

173
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:09,705
Yeah, an empty Sprite can,

174
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:12,075
an old man's fingernail
in my pocket,

175
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:14,494
and a picture of Patrick Ewing

176
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,511
on a roller coaster.

177
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:16,979
- I'm all set.
- Great.

178
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:19,215
Hi. My friend here
is enrolling

179
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:20,483
in the vet school next month,

180
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:22,235
and she would like
to be shown around.

181
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:24,186
Totally, happy to.
I'm Laura.

182
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:26,339
I'm April Ludgate Kevorkian.

183
00:06:26,341 --> 00:06:28,091
So you go with Laura,
who seems really nice

184
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:30,009
and does not deserve
to be tortured.

185
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:31,394
And I will come
meet up with you

186
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:33,162
after I finish
at the baby store.

187
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:34,747
Sure you wanna
leave me here with her?

188
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:36,165
What if I'm a murderer?

189
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,567
Oh, that's funny.

190
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,970
This is worse
than I could've imagined.

191
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:43,172
Their debt-to-equity ratio
is ridonkulous.

192
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:45,191
What a hilarious word.

193
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:46,976
It reminds me
of a ridiculous donkey.

194
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:48,060
He's the best.

195
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:49,328
What does this mean for them?

196
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,746
They were in financial trouble

197
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:52,865
a few years ago,
like Pawnee was,

198
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:56,285
but their government
just kept borrowing money.

199
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:57,620
Eagleton is on the brink

200
00:06:57,622 --> 00:06:59,755
of an epic financial disaster.

201
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:01,007
Ahh.

202
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,710
Now that is the sexiest thing
you've ever said to me.

203
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:05,845
Really, that?

204
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:08,047
This is gonna hand me
the recall election.

205
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:09,765
I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.

206
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,968
Now I get to remind people
of that fact

207
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,553
as we watch our worst enemy

208
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:15,521
collapse into bankruptcy.

209
00:07:15,523 --> 00:07:17,723
Plus, guess what I get
to do after the game now.

210
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:18,858
You pretend you're Ingrid.

211
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,009
Let's pretend this box

212
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:21,694
is the basket of apples
I bet them on the game.

213
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,062
I see where
you're going with this.

214
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:24,346
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, you're gonna ask me

215
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:25,815
- if I like apples...
- Do you like apples?

216
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:27,533
We just watched this movie
two nights ago, so...

217
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:28,701
- Do you like apples?
- I don't wanna do this.

218
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:30,820
How about them apples?

219
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,289
Paul, if you ever see
another one of these

220
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:35,925
with my name on it,

221
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,967
I want you to drive
into the woods and bury it.

222
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,720
I don't decide
who gets mail, sir.

223
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:40,838
I just deliver it.

224
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,273
Passing the buck...

225
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,992
the last refuge of the cowardly
and black-hearted.

226
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:47,512
- That seems harsh.
- Get out.

227
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,247
We got rid of your cell phone.

228
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,749
This is your last credit card.

229
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,885
Are you sure you want me
to cut up this card?

230
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,570
It gets you into
the parking garage.

231
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,871
I'll be taking the bus now,

232
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:58,706
and I'll be paying in cash.

233
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,359
What other traces of me
exist in the world?

234
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,693
Think, people.

235
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:04,445
Isn't there a photo of you
up at JJ's diner,

236
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:05,963
from that time when you...
aah!

237
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,298
Come on, Tom!

238
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,350
This place is unbelievable.

239
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:11,285
It has everything I need:

240
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:14,005
Video monitors,
lead-free pacifiers.

241
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:15,690
These are the first bibs
I've ever seen

242
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,075
without Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s
face on them.

243
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,094
Really?

244
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:21,646
April?

245
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:22,980
Excuse me, sorry.

246
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,249
April, why aren't you
at orientation?

247
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:26,467
Um, I was at orientation,

248
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:27,885
but it was lame, so I left.

249
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:30,437
And then I kept walking,
and now here I am.

250
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,139
We are going back there
right now, young lady.

251
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:34,141
- Mm-mm.
- Come on.

252
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:35,927
God, get off me, stranger.

253
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,662
I'm so sorry we're late.

254
00:08:37,664 --> 00:08:39,130
We came from
our bankruptcy brunch.

255
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,849
And Michael Buble played,
but he ran a little long.

256
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:43,050
I love Michael Buble.

257
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:45,286
Was a bankruptcy brunch
the best idea?

258
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:46,337
Sure, let's not have brunch...

259
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,872
like animals.

260
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:50,057
Well, um, some of
these expenditures

261
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,842
are questionable.

262
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:54,895
Uh, you filled the public pools
with bottled water?

263
00:08:54,897 --> 00:08:56,347
Total body hydration.

264
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:57,481
What is this here?

265
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:59,951
This massive expenditure
from public works?

266
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,003
Ah, yes. Well, yes.

267
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:04,772
We purchased HBO
for the whole town.

268
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:06,574
I'm sorry.
You spent government money

269
00:09:06,576 --> 00:09:08,326
on a TV subscription?

270
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:10,428
It's not TV.

271
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,396
Al right.
Uh, Leslie's put together

272
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,615
a presentation
for a financial recovery.

273
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:15,649
Great.

274
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:16,801
You may find it
very informative.

275
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:18,803
Let's get started
with our first slide.

276
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,689
"Well, well, well..."

277
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,190
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

278
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:27,461
JJ, a few months ago,
I came in here

279
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:29,013
and began eating eggs.

280
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:30,915
They were delicious,
so I ordered more.

281
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,867
Before long,
I believe I had eaten...

282
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:34,835
51 eggs in 20 minutes.

283
00:09:34,837 --> 00:09:36,136
Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.

284
00:09:36,138 --> 00:09:38,022
The last ten were still
in the shell.

285
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,908
It was a JJ's diner record,
and you took his picture.

286
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,894
Now, we need that picture,
for privacy reasons.

287
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,179
Okay, but I don't know

288
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:47,281
how anybody
would know it's you.

289
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:50,718
We followed your instructions.

290
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,738
That's too much information.

291
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,939
Let's go.

292
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:56,223
Where are we going now?

293
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:59,560
I've eaten a lot of food
in a lot of restaurants.

294
00:09:59,562 --> 00:10:03,280
Why is everyone else
so bad at eating?

295
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,782
I only agreed to come back here

296
00:10:04,784 --> 00:10:05,866
because of our deal.

297
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,101
Do you promise to play along?

298
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:08,052
- Yes.
- Do you?

299
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:10,137
- Yes.
- Hi, you're back.

300
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,638
Hello again.

301
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,906
As you remember, I'm April,

302
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:15,743
and this is Ann,
my 65-year-old grandmother.

303
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,145
Yes, that's who I am.
Anyway,

304
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:19,413
we'd love to
hear about Bloomington.

305
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:21,982
It seems like a real hip
kind of college town.

306
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:25,186
Mee-maw, God, no one uses
the word hip anymore.

307
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:27,038
Sometimes I wish you
went down on the Titanic

308
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,739
with all your sorority sisters.

309
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:29,840
I would be happy
to show you guys

310
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:31,125
around the campus.

311
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,060
Is there anything in particular
that you wanna see?

312
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:34,928
How are your local graveyards?

313
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,965
I have some planning to do.

314
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,366
"You blew it.

315
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:40,634
"Super hard.

316
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,403
"Complete buffoonery.

317
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:43,988
It's hilarious."

318
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,105
And "You deserve it."

319
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:46,323
Hey, you think you might wanna

320
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:47,458
take it easy on them
a little bit?

321
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,343
Oh, like they
took it easy on us

322
00:10:49,345 --> 00:10:50,611
when they stole all our money

323
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:51,946
and seceded from our town?

324
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:54,198
That was 200 years ago.
Cool it.

325
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,883
Fine. I'll skip ahead.

326
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:58,051
Do you have a plan
that will help us or not?

327
00:10:58,053 --> 00:10:59,687
We have borrowed absolutely

328
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:00,821
everything we can
from the state.

329
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:03,724
And really,
Pawnee is our only hope.

330
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,009
We do have a plan.

331
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:09,313
We are willing to provide
a bridge loan for $50,000.

332
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:11,832
25% interest
compounded monthly.

333
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,551
And you need to release
a statement that says

334
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:15,352
that Pawnee rules
and Eagleton drools.

335
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:17,121
Well, now you're just
being nasty.

336
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,790
I understand that our towns
have a complicated history,

337
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:22,643
but we have
a saying in Eagleton...

338
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:24,779
"You don't kick
a dressage horse

339
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,564
after a failed
pas de deux."

340
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:27,798
Whatever, blondie.

341
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,934
Your butler made your bed,
now you gotta lie in it.

342
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,152
And if you walk out that door,

343
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:33,738
none of us here,
and I repeat, none of us

344
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,256
will ever help you again.

345
00:11:35,258 --> 00:11:36,557
Oh, my God.

346
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,110
They have Michael Buble
on retainer.

347
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:41,562
Okay, all public photos
of me recovered.

348
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:44,265
Nameplate removed
from my office door.

349
00:11:44,267 --> 00:11:48,786
Pediatrician files confiscated
and destroyed.

350
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,588
- Anything I'm missing?
- Great news, Ron.

351
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,156
Jean-Ralphio
loves your shirt.

352
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,941
What the hell
are you talking about?

353
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:55,242
Oh, I've been taking pictures
of you all day

354
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:56,410
for my new Facebook album:

355
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:59,797
"Ronswan: Gettin' off the grid."

356
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,382
Tom, do you maybe see a problem

357
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:06,520
with what you've done?

358
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:09,807
I do now.
Yes, sorry.

359
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:12,143
Erase.

360
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,411
Erase. Erase.

361
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,964
Erase all pictures of Ron!

362
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:19,884
Erase all pictures of Ron!

363
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:22,486
Erase all pictures of Ron!

364
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,238
What the hell is happening?

365
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,207
I think you accidentally
opened up vine.

366
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,175
You just vined
your first selfie, Ron.

367
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:30,127
And I'm vining you
vine your selfie.

368
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:33,397
The world is a nightmare.

369
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,667
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

370
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,003
Erase all pictures of Ron!

371
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,088
Erase all pictures
of Ron!

372
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:43,958
The B-line
is a cool outdoor trail

373
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
that cuts
right through downtown.

374
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:48,495
She said the B-line
is cool, Mee-maw.

375
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:50,047
Cool means good.

376
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:52,266
Thank you, Laura,
for showing us around.

377
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:53,267
Sure.

378
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:55,836
See you
in a couple weeks, April.

379
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:57,922
See?
This place is great.

380
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,640
Aren't you glad we came back
and talked to her?

381
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:01,108
No. It was pointless.

382
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,610
I'm not going to school here.

383
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:04,311
April, don't flake out on this.

384
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:06,247
You're gonna love it here.
Bloomington is great.

385
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:09,850
It's got culture and music
and tons of youngsters.

386
00:13:09,852 --> 00:13:13,204
Youngsters?
Am I 65 years old?

387
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,422
Yeah, I'm not going here.
I don't want to.

388
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:16,841
Let's leave.

389
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,579
- Think fast.
- Oh!

390
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:25,165
Why do people keep assuming
I'm ready to catch things?

391
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,635
"Eagleton:
No money, mo' problems."

392
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:28,819
Fantastic, right?

393
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:30,070
I made enough of them
for everybody

394
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:31,104
to wear at the game.

395
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,656
I do like
a good internal rhyme.

396
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:33,841
Ben, you ready for dinner?

397
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:35,092
We can go over
the poll numbers.

398
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:37,177
Oh... you know,

399
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:38,846
I've got a few phone calls
to make.

400
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:40,481
Can you give me an hour?

401
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,032
I can meet you there.

402
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:44,251
Oh, my God.

403
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:46,503
- What is she doing here?
- I'm sorry, Leslie,

404
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:48,389
but you didn't really
help them very much,

405
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:49,640
so we volunteered to give them

406
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:51,308
a little financial advice.

407
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,893
You didn't actually
help us at all.

408
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:55,729
- Just one second.
- Yeah.

409
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:57,898
I'm just gonna
help them out, okay?

410
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,833
- Mm.
- Just for an hour.

411
00:13:59,835 --> 00:14:01,368
He's just being
a good neighbor.

412
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,053
We're in a lot of trouble,
Leslie.

413
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,388
I don't need
any lip from you, okay?

414
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,006
You're in trouble because
of your own stupidity.

415
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:08,776
I have a PhD
from the Sorbonne.

416
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:10,895
For what?
Wearing Chanel suits?

417
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,280
There was
a fashion component, yes.

418
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:14,815
I'm not mad
that you're doing this.

419
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:16,516
Yes, I am mad
that you're doing this.

420
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:17,735
But even worse,
I'm mad that you just

421
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,069
- lied to me about it.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

422
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:20,354
We all swore
that we weren't gonna

423
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:21,989
ever help her again, ever.

424
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:23,540
I never said that.
You did.

425
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:25,409
I speak for all of us
in all matters.

426
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:27,161
That is what you
tacitly agreed to

427
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:28,323
- when you married me.
- What?

428
00:14:28,346 --> 00:14:30,255
Yeah, let's go.
You've changed your mind.

429
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,541
You're not gonna
help her anymore.

430
00:14:31,543 --> 00:14:32,542
Leslie, I just wanna

431
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:33,975
borrow your husband
for the evening.

432
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,245
Can we please talk about what happened
back there?

433
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,513
What, Ann? I just stole your phone

434
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,028
and texted every guy
in it that the baby was theirs.

435
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:46,269
It's not that big of a deal.

436
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:47,802
Listen, I know
you don't believe this,

437
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,938
but I care about your future.

438
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,007
And I'm just
a little disappointed

439
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:53,942
that you're just not
following through with this.

440
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:56,526
Yeah, it's not about
following through, okay?

441
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:58,522
I was on the fence about
whether I wanted to do it.

442
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:02,126
And as soon as I got there,
I just had a gut feeling

443
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:04,095
that it wasn't right for me,
that's all.

444
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:06,898
So, just like that,
boom... huge life decision made?

445
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,683
That's how I make
all my life decisions.

446
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:10,885
My gut is always right, okay?

447
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,720
It was right about
marrying Andy,

448
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:13,905
and it was right
when it told me

449
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:15,039
that you would be
the worst person

450
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,540
I would ever meet in my life.

451
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,392
And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann.

452
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,362
So gross!

453
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,164
How do you get your gut
to talk to you?

454
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,799
You don't get your gut
to talk to you.

455
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:27,068
You just listen
when it says something.

456
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,870
Well, right now
my gut is saying

457
00:15:29,872 --> 00:15:31,756
that we are going to listen
to Mariah Carey

458
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:33,307
the whole way home.

459
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:37,662
Good.

460
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,273
Whoa.
Wow, I'm really surprised

461
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,075
you're sitting on this side
of the bleachers

462
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:53,294
and not on the Eagleton side
with your new girlfriend Ingrid.

463
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:55,630
Leslie, I'm just
trying to help them.

464
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:57,481
Why?
They wouldn't help us

465
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:58,482
if the tables were turned.

466
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,201
I mean,
they're 50 points ahead,

467
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:01,719
and they're still dunking.

468
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:03,287
I mean, look at this guy.

469
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:06,357
There's no way
he is in high school.

470
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:09,026
And I'm better
at French horn too, Eric.

471
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:14,465
People are gonna
lose their jobs, Leslie.

472
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,567
And the recovery
will take years.

473
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:20,087
Deep down, I think
you feel bad for them.

474
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:22,590
Okay, I do a little, yes.

475
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:25,576
And I'm sorry that I blew up
at you yesterday.

476
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:27,211
With all the recall stuff
happening,

477
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:30,047
I just really need to feel
like you're on my team,

478
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:32,383
and seeing you with them

479
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:34,318
made me feel like you weren't.

480
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,070
I'm always gonna be
on your team.

481
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:38,422
You never have to worry
about that.

482
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,691
Defense!

483
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:42,943
Oh!

484
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:46,430
Eagleton player number seven,
injured on the play.

485
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:47,882
Official time-out.

486
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,734
Oh, God.

487
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:51,118
I'm gonna say something.

488
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,370
And if I throw up on you
after I say it,

489
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:54,972
just know that
you've been warned.

490
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:58,843
I know how we can
help Eagleton.

491
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:00,461
I don't see
what the problem is.

492
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:02,430
I will give you
a certain amount of gold

493
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,882
in exchange for
a recreational vehicle.

494
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,151
I still need an address
for insurance purposes.

495
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:08,986
This will be my new home.

496
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:13,457
The address is wherever
it is parked.

497
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:14,909
Where have you been?

498
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:16,527
I had a flat tire,
and I've been trying

499
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:18,162
to get in touch with you
for hours.

500
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,547
Sorry, darling.

501
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:22,166
I've been busy destroying
most of my personal effects

502
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:24,518
and threatening
a postal worker.

503
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,620
Ron, I know you value
your privacy,

504
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:28,606
but you are a husband
and a father now.

505
00:17:28,608 --> 00:17:30,307
You can't just
roam the streets in an RV

506
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,709
and be impossible to find.

507
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:34,511
I'm on a mission
to get off the grid.

508
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:36,163
Well, you don't have to be
entirely on the grid,

509
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:37,981
but have to be on our grid.

510
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:42,019
I suppose you wouldn't
consider moving.

511
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:44,071
I've heard the school system
in the tunnels

512
00:17:44,073 --> 00:17:46,924
beneath Yucca Mountain
is adequate.

513
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,676
I love you, but your solution
to every problem

514
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:50,160
is to live inside a mountain.

515
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:53,180
I love you too.

516
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:55,099
Okay, one more time.

517
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:56,283
Are you absolutely sure

518
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,618
you wanna go through with this?

519
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,270
A lot of people
are gonna get angry,

520
00:17:59,272 --> 00:18:02,022
and you might lose
the recall election.

521
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:04,942
Or, if I pull it off,
I just might win.

522
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,144
Plus, a very smart member
of my team

523
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:09,313
pointed out
it's the right thing to do.

524
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:10,781
Good morning.

525
00:18:10,783 --> 00:18:12,249
After an all-night
strategy session,

526
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:14,552
the towns of Pawnee
and Eagleton

527
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:16,437
have come up
with a potential solution

528
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,856
to Eagleton's budget crisis.

529
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,775
The town of Eagleton
will be dissolved

530
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:23,344
and re-absorbed
into Pawnee.

531
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:26,981
Pawnee will provide
some government services,

532
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:30,584
as well as taking on
some of Eagleton's debts.

533
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:32,920
I understand.

534
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,889
Look, I hate Eagletonians
as much as you do.

535
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,540
I hate their stupid
beautiful faces

536
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:38,609
and their stupid shiny hair.

537
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:39,910
We looked at every alternative.

538
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,278
This is the only scenario

539
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,114
that prevents
Eagleton's financial crisis

540
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:45,015
from spiraling throughout
the entire region.

541
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:46,750
Eagleton is terrible!

542
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,936
Why should I bail them out
with the hard-earned money

543
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,254
from my unemployment check?

544
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:52,706
- Yeah!
- Because they are our neighbor

545
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,041
and they've
sprained their ankle.

546
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:55,960
And when your neighbor
sprains his ankle,

547
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:57,327
you help him off the court.

548
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,763
I understand you have concerns
and questions,

549
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,782
and we are here
to listen to them.

550
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:03,868
I got something to say.

551
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,119
One at a time, please.

552
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:07,004
I hate
the one-at-a-time system!

553
00:19:07,006 --> 00:19:08,339
Why should we bail them out?

554
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,141
No one bailed me out
when I got arrested for arson.

555
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:12,143
You can't just merge two towns.

556
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:13,777
It's against the rules
of nature.

557
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,197
What's next...
merging a man with his dog?

558
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,448
I live in Eagleton.

559
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,316
And frankly,
I don't like the idea

560
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:20,651
of living in Pawnee.

561
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:23,070
They're a little...
oh, what's the word?

562
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,405
Have-no-money.

563
00:19:26,325 --> 00:19:29,243
Bertram, that's enough.

564
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:32,079
First of all,
Eagleton has no money.

565
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:34,531
Second of all,
they are gracious enough

566
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:35,883
to throw us a lifeline,

567
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,218
and we should be
eternally grateful

568
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,036
for their generosity.

569
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:40,704
They're a town of angels...

570
00:19:40,706 --> 00:19:43,507
greasy, denim-clad angels,

571
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:45,226
but angels nonetheless.

572
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:47,044
Yeah, we'll take it.

573
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,898
I mean, did you steal this
from a museum?

574
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:52,638
Maybe find it frozen in ice?

575
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,140
It looks like
the original phone

576
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:55,608
from the movie Wall Street.

577
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:58,144
I think it's just
the original phone, period.

578
00:19:58,195 --> 00:20:01,263
Ew, gross,
it has "buttons."

579
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:03,816
Okay, girls,
this is a magic phone, okay?

580
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,785
Only you and I
have got the numbers.

581
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,954
So if you ever need Ron
for any reason,

582
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:09,788
you just call and
he'll be there in a flash.

583
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,325
Yes, I will.
I'll keep it right here.

584
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,243
It snaps right in,
snug and secure.

585
00:20:14,277 --> 00:20:15,745
A cell phone belt clip?

586
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,830
No, Ron.
Oh, my God!

587
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,449
Yeah, I can't be seen with you.

588
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,001
Travelin' Ann Perkins!

589
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:23,452
How was Bloomington?

590
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,088
It was amazing.

591
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:26,672
They had all the baby
supplies we need,

592
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:28,591
and they had all this
other cool stuff.

593
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,626
They had
a bike-sharing program

594
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:34,097
and a vegan
Afghan restaurant and...

595
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:35,314
Oh, my God.
I'm having one.

596
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,633
- I'm having one right now.
- A contraction?

597
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:39,819
No. Dude, I'm, like,
three months pregnant.

598
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:42,021
I-I know.
I'm just so excited.

599
00:20:42,072 --> 00:20:45,825
The thing I'm having
is a gut feeling.

600
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:47,443
What would you think about
raising our child

601
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:50,296
somewhere other than Pawnee?

602
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,382
Thank you, Leslie,

603
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:55,718
from all of us in Eagleton.

604
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:58,454
Our citizens owe you
a debt of gratitude.

605
00:20:58,472 --> 00:20:59,889
Well, I think
at the end of the day,

606
00:20:59,923 --> 00:21:02,085
everybody realizes
it's something we have to do.

607
00:21:02,205 --> 00:21:03,459
On the bright side,

608
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:05,895
we did win the basketball game.

609
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:07,230
I think you owe us some apples.

610
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:09,265
- You better pay up.
- Oh, you don't want them.

611
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,267
All of Pawnee's apples
have been recalled...

612
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,402
- g. Coli.
- You mean e. Coli?

613
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:14,570
I wish.

614
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,511
Way easy to treat.

615
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:18,802
Welcome to Pawnee!
