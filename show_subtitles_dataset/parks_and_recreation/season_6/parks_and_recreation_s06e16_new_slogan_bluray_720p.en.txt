1
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:04,499
Okay, I don't want
to over-hype this,

2
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:06,201
but presenting...
Dun-da-da-dah!

3
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:08,426
the new city of Pawnee website!

4
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:09,946
Totally revamped!

5
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:11,348
You can pay parking tickets,

6
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:14,551
you can apply for a business
license and the best part

7
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,505
is we're going to put up
an online poll so people

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,188
can pick the new town slogan!

9
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:19,589
Hey, look a panda!

10
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:21,858
Yeah, that's just some mascot
thing

11
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:23,526
that the designer put up
on the front page.

12
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:24,828
But more importantly,

13
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:27,797
you can now apply for a utility
tax refund... online!

14
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:29,599
Wait, the panda's name
is Peebo.

15
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:30,667
Peebo.

16
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:32,102
Look, you can even play
ping-pong.

17
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:33,603
- What?
- I want to play!

18
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:36,006
No, me first! Me first!
That's it. I'm calling it.

19
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,941
Guys, Ben worked
really hard on this, okay?

20
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,509
Let's look at the online polls.

21
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:41,278
It's gonna be a cool way
to choose our new town's slogan.

22
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:43,246
Oh! The panda holds a paddle
with his tail.

23
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,314
I want to play!

24
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:45,615
Congratulations, Ben.

25
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,518
This is truly a fine panda game
you made. Well done.

26
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:49,619
What else does he do?

27
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:51,588
I think if you click on
the bamboo,

28
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:52,722
it puts on a top hat.

29
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,125
What?

30
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,860
I love you, Ben!

31
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:05,902
Sync & corrections by honeybunny

32
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:20,250
What's wrong with you?

33
00:01:20,284 --> 00:01:22,552
You look like Meryl Streep
at the end of Ironweed.

34
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:23,987
You wish.

35
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:25,989
Well, I've been driving
all over Indiana

36
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:27,958
looking for bands to play
the unity concert.

37
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:29,326
I got nothing to show for,

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,461
except for four car accidents.

39
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:34,864
All these strangers'
insurance information.

40
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:36,733
Ooh, I get it,
you have car insurance.

41
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,368
Why don't you brag about it?

42
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:39,903
Hey, you are from Eagleton,
right?

43
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:42,072
Are there any places out there
I should check out?

44
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:44,174
I used to go see live shows
at Patterson's.

45
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:46,343
But I'm boycotting until
the owner apologizes

46
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:48,211
for what she said to me
at the dog park.

47
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:50,313
Cool. Anything else?

48
00:01:50,348 --> 00:01:52,249
I hear Cozy's Bar is pretty
packed on Thursdays.

49
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:54,551
But I've never been because
it's mostly middle-aged women

50
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,219
and I'm allergic
to turkey neck.

51
00:01:56,254 --> 00:01:57,454
Really?
That's the best part.

52
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:00,357
We should split
a turkey sometime.

53
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:01,725
Oh, Mr. Larson.

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,993
Thank you so much
for meeting me here.

55
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:04,527
Happy to.
I was in the area.

56
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:06,997
The chance for me to return
your binder full of questions

57
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,398
about the job.

58
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:09,672
I think I answered all of them.

59
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,468
Thank you.
I cannot wait to check this out.

60
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:13,703
Now, the reason why I asked you
to meet me here...

61
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:15,138
More questions about the job.

62
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,706
Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:19,242
Martha? I'm gonna need
two hours worth of waffles.

64
00:02:19,277 --> 00:02:21,978
Grant Larson has offered me
a chance to oversee

65
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:24,414
a branch office
of the national park service.

66
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:27,150
This is like the parks
equivalent of Bruce Springsteen

67
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:28,919
pulling Courtney Cox onstage.

68
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:31,187
I mean, one minute you're just
a regular girl in the crowd,

69
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:33,256
and the next minute you're
dancing 10 feet away

70
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,959
from freakin' Max Weinberg!

71
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:38,728
Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth
from last question

72
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:41,831
is about the Heartland Exotic
Plant Management Project.

73
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:45,101
Now, were would I be actually
doing the physical planting?

74
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:46,937
Because it is always been
a dream of mine

75
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:49,773
to plant spotted jewelweed
along the red river bank

76
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:52,242
in Arkansas, but I'm sure
you hear that a lot.

77
00:02:52,276 --> 00:02:54,811
Well, you wouldn't actually be
planting things.

78
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:57,080
I mean, you're overseeing
200 people.

79
00:02:57,114 --> 00:02:59,749
The everyday minutia
you would delegate to staff.

80
00:02:59,784 --> 00:03:03,019
Leslie, your job is more
creative, big picture stuff.

81
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:05,088
No more boring people working
for you.

82
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:08,124
Good!
I hate paperwork.

83
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,460
I hardly ever do it in my bed
on a Saturday night

84
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:13,296
while listening
to old spice girls CDs.

85
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,198
Regal Meagle.
My favorite realtor.

86
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,933
You got some hot properties
to show me?

87
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:18,234
You know it.

88
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,936
Remember my list of
must-haves: Open kitchen,

89
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:22,005
fireplace, exposed brick,
and you know

90
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,673
I wouldn't kick a skylight
out of bed.

91
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:26,076
I'm opening Pawnee's first
authentic Sinatra style

92
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,143
Italian restaurant...

93
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:28,778
"Tom's Bistro."

94
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:31,982
I'm kind of like a skinny,
handsome, Indian Mario Batali...

95
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,383
who doesn't know how to cook.

96
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,986
Before we go, I got you guys
a little something

97
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,320
for helping me out.

98
00:03:37,355 --> 00:03:39,923
Oh! Love it!

99
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:42,726
A Larry voodoo doll?

100
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,961
Tom, that's so sweet.
Thanks.

101
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:48,131
Ow! Oh, my gosh!

102
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,332
I didn't even do anything.

103
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:51,334
The voodoo doll is reading
my thoughts.

104
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,603
So it seems like it went
really well, right?

105
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:55,105
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

106
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,107
Grant is great,
the job is great.

107
00:03:57,141 --> 00:03:59,075
- The waffles were great.
- Great.

108
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,510
So we're just about ready
to go live

109
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:01,811
with the slogan poll.
You want to see?

110
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:03,647
Now that Eagleton and Pawnee
have merged,

111
00:04:03,681 --> 00:04:06,316
it is time to pick
a new town slogan.

112
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,653
And a slogan can make a big
difference with tourism

113
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:10,787
in a town's identity.

114
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:12,222
There is New York,

115
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:13,857
the city that never sleeps.

116
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:16,793
And then there is Glenwater,
Florida,

117
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:20,130
home of America's most violent
Walmart parking lot.

118
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:21,998
Okay, so people can vote now.

119
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,534
Yeah, see, that's the super
cool thing about this website

120
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:27,404
is it does all the work for us
so we can just sit back

121
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,339
and take it easy.

122
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:31,875
No. No, we're not gonna
do that.

123
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:34,144
We're gonna sit forward
and take it hard.

124
00:04:34,178 --> 00:04:35,879
- Um, what?
- There's a lot of nitty-gritty

125
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:36,980
left to do, Ben.

126
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:38,281
We need to roll up our sleeves,

127
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:39,449
we need to go door to door,

128
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,051
we need to hand out fliers,
and canvass.

129
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:42,385
You know what we should do?

130
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,521
We should have a press junket,
to publicize the poll.

131
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:45,835
Okay, I hope you had lunch
plans,

132
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:47,177
'cause now you get
to cancel them.

133
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:49,226
Well, I-I did.

134
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,629
So this was one of Eagleton's
top sushi restaurants.

135
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:54,831
But you can't out-run
the whale meat police forever.

136
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,366
This is great.
I love it!

137
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,901
Look at it,
I can picture it now.

138
00:04:57,935 --> 00:04:59,536
That's where the politicians
will sit,

139
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,005
this is where the connected
guys will bring their goomahs.

140
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,239
This place is perfect.

141
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:04,908
- How much?
- 9,000 a month.

142
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,376
What? That's way more
that I can afford.

143
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,744
Whatever.
It's not that great.

144
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,179
Plus, it's really far away
from work

145
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:10,747
and that'd be annoying.

146
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,515
It's not a big deal.

147
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,217
I mean, when it first launches
I'll go back and forth,

148
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:17,320
but hopefully it takes off and
it'll become a full-time job.

149
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:19,889
Come on, I'll show some places
in your price range.

150
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,228
This press junket
is a brilliant idea, isn't it?

151
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:28,331
Mr. Strange Cameraman
Who I Never Met.

152
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:30,467
Leslie, I told you,
I'm not gonna participate

153
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:33,570
in your weird Julia Roberts,
cameraman husband fantasy.

154
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:34,905
Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here.

155
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:38,308
Leslie, your poll is designed
to choose a new slogan.

156
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:41,845
And a slogan is a series of
words that have a meaning.

157
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,114
So true, Perd.

158
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:45,348
All of the choices

159
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:47,717
for the town slogan
are wonderful,

160
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,953
but if I had to choose
my favorite

161
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:53,557
it would probably be
"Storied past, bright future."

162
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:57,560
Well, the story of my interest
level is: It's medium.

163
00:05:57,595 --> 00:05:59,362
Joan, this poll is a chance
to give

164
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:01,798
our newly-merged city
a new identity...

165
00:06:01,832 --> 00:06:04,868
to really rebrand this town.

166
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:07,470
Yes, great question.
I have been thinking

167
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:08,805
of rebranding myself.

168
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,209
What do you think about
Juan Callamezzo?

169
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:13,944
Isn't "Juan" a man's name?

170
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:15,545
No, it means "flower."

171
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,047
I think it means "John."

172
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:20,083
Crazy Ira and the Douche

173
00:06:20,117 --> 00:06:23,253
from 93.7 FM, the Groove.

174
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:26,122
Leslie, do you believe
that this new slogan

175
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:27,891
will integrate Pawnee
and Eagleton

176
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,993
into one cohesive city?

177
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:33,663
Wow, that's a very thoughtful
question, Crazy Ira.

178
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:34,965
Yes, yes, I do.

179
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,433
Follow-up question, Leslie,

180
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:39,336
show us your boobs!

181
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:42,405
Will this fit
on a bumper sticker?

182
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:45,609
Gosh, this place is packed.

183
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:47,310
You folks must really like
this guy.

184
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:49,613
Honey, he is sex on a stick.

185
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,114
Ladies and gentlemen,

186
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:55,352
put your jazzy hands together
for my man, Mr. Duke Silver!

187
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:01,825
A smooth and silky evening
to you all.

188
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:04,494
On nights like this,
when the cold winds blow,

189
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:08,098
and the air is awash
in the swirling eddies

190
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:09,599
of our dreams,

191
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:12,602
come with me
and find safe haven...

192
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:16,339
in a warm bathtub
full of my jazz.

193
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,708
Uh!

194
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:24,748
Well, the good news is
your poll was a big hit.

195
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:25,982
Thousands of people voted.

196
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:27,317
That's great.
What's leading?

197
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,020
- "Storied past, bright future"?
- No.

198
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,388
The current leader is

199
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:34,691
"Pawnee,
welcome to Douche nation."

200
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,626
- What?
- Crazy Ira and the Douche

201
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:38,562
got their bonehead radio fans

202
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:40,697
to flood the poll
with write-in votes.

203
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,465
Why did we include
a write-in option?

204
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,401
Because every election
has a write-in option.

205
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:46,236
That's how democracy works.

206
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,471
I'm not a dictator.
If I we're a dictator,

207
00:07:48,506 --> 00:07:51,608
I would throw the Douche
in prison without a trial.

208
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:53,677
I would be
a very strong dictator,

209
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:56,980
and you would be my bodyguard,
and you would lead my army.

210
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:59,749
Okay, I know we should
figure out how to fix this.

211
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:01,685
But I'm starting
to get kind of turned on

212
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,486
imagining you as a dictator,
is that bad?

213
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,921
No, it's okay.

214
00:08:07,597 --> 00:08:08,997
You know,
we could just figure out

215
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,976
a different strategy
for picking a slogan.

216
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:12,663
You don't have to go
on their show.

217
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:14,298
No, I want to do this.
I enjoy the challenge.

218
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,933
So, how do I look?

219
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:19,016
I need these guys to think
that I'm, like, super chill.

220
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:19,896
Is this gonna work?

221
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:21,272
Oh, what up, Lez?

222
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:24,540
Backwards hat... shows a real
lack of respect for authority.

223
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,908
I like that.

224
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:27,310
What's up, little mayor?

225
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:29,111
Are you gonna freak out again?

226
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:31,113
So, Leslie, what's the deal?

227
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:33,282
Are you just here
to yell at us again?

228
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:37,019
Yeah, we are in store for
another Leslie Knope nag sesh?

229
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,956
Crazy Ira, do the dishes!

230
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,661
Classic! No way!

231
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,222
I'm not here to nag, guys.

232
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,097
I'm just psyched
to be in the studio, you know?

233
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,093
I'm just... chillin'
in the studes with my dudes.

234
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,995
If you're really not really
here to nag us,

235
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,332
then maybe you'll help us
with our next segment...

236
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,503
"Rating celebrities' boobs!"

237
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,171
Perfect.

238
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,641
On a scale, from 1 to
ga-ga-ga-going!

239
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:06,445
How would you rate
Emma Watson's boobs?

240
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,048
First of all, I would rate
her acting as an "A."

241
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,317
You have three seconds to
answer or we're gonna withdraw

242
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,253
- a donation from charity.
- From charity? Oh.

243
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,455
A minus.

244
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,692
More like double D minus.

245
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,429
Me so horny!

246
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,564
I knew it. I knew it.

247
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,538
- Can I help you?
- Maybe.

248
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,640
I was out at the jazz club
last night...

249
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,042
scouting bands
for the unity concert.

250
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,144
And I saw something
very interesting.

251
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,285
- I am Duke Silver.
- I have a twin brother.

252
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,887
What?

253
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,323
- I have a twin brother.
- You are Duke Silver?

254
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,324
Yes, I am Duke Silver.

255
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,664
The only other people
who know are Tom and April.

256
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,332
So, please, keep it to yourself.

257
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,268
Are you kidding me?
You are really good!

258
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,570
You are, like,
the saxophone player

259
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,305
for the California-raisins-good.

260
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,673
No joke.
You know what?

261
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,442
I'm booking you...
for the unity concert.

262
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,677
Absolutely not.

263
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,579
My musical career is private.

264
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,281
If my secret got out,

265
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,750
this office would be waist-deep
in women's undergarments.

266
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,952
No, I'm in charge of booking
the bands for the concert,

267
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,986
and I say, you're in.
You're gonna play right after

268
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,989
Bobby knight ranger.
It's a night ranger cover band

269
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,424
where they only
wear read sweaters.

270
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,293
It's gonna be epic!

271
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,195
Final round, Leslie,

272
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,363
boobs or ass?

273
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:35,134
Hard to believe this is a fan
game for your radio listeners.

274
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,503
Ah... I'm gonna say butt.

275
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,504
Ding, ding, ding!

276
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:40,139
- Yes!
- You are correct.

277
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,008
This is my mom's dumper!

278
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,311
Oh, mommy!

279
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,779
I don't know how
you got yours hand on that.

280
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,214
I took it.

281
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,150
Good. Well, it is been so fun
bro-ing out with my dogs.

282
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,987
I never knew that objectifying
women could be so much fun.

283
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,301
We're running out of time here

284
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,224
so just a quick reminder
to write-in

285
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,026
"Welcome to Douche nation!"

286
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,396
As the official town slogan
for pawneecity.gov.

287
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:07,333
Or you know what would also be
kind of dope

288
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,535
for the people of Douche nation
to do?

289
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,237
It's vote for another slogan.

290
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:15,140
Like, you know,
"Storied past, bright future"?

291
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,477
But... I don't care.
I don't give a fart, bros.

292
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,846
You know, just do your thing,
chicken wing.

293
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,349
Hey, Crazy Ira,
have you seen my stick?

294
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,823
- Where's your stick?
- I don't know.

295
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,752
Lesbo Baggins,
you know where my stick is?

296
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,988
- You...
- Oh! Found my stick.

297
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,923
Oh, where did you find it?

298
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:34,860
Up Leslie Knope's butt!

299
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,229
- Yo, where my stick up?
- It's up her butt, papi.

300
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,268
Jewish Greg, whatever we're
paying you, it's not enough.

301
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,205
Damn it,
I almost pulled that off.

302
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,606
No, you really didn't.

303
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,609
Just delete the poll.
Let the slogan thing go.

304
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,945
Or, maybe we sneak back
in there...

305
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,247
you distract those guys
for, like, 30, 90 minutes,

306
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,202
I get on live radio,
I give an impassioned speech

307
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,851
about what slogan
I want to endorse

308
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,925
and I play a few songs,
which I always wanted to do,

309
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,588
and then we just see
what happens.

310
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,223
No.

311
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,558
I should just let this go.
Okay.

312
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,199
Dude, what are you doing?

313
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,701
That looks like a perfectly good
saxophone case.

314
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,671
Wait a minute.
What's inside that case?

315
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,906
I am ending
my secret musical career.

316
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,709
- I have to kill Duke Silver.
- No, come on, man.

317
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,743
You're really good.

318
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,745
- You can't quit.
- Sorry, Andrew.

319
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,980
I would rather never play again

320
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,182
than have everyone know
my secret.

321
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,252
Good-bye, Duke Silver.

322
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,555
May you rest... in jazz.

323
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:43,395
So, Tom told you are sort
of like a computer expert.

324
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,930
Uh... yeah.

325
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,599
You can say that.

326
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,667
These jerks are trying
to hijack my online poll,

327
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,270
and so far the leading town
slogan is,

328
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,572
"Home of the stick
up Leslie Knope's butt."

329
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,207
Yeah, yeah.
I voted for that one.

330
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,010
Great. I'm wondering,
is there a way I can communicate

331
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,179
- with everybody who voted?
- Yeah, I can do that.

332
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,480
Should take about two minutes.

333
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,515
Just PayPal me some bitcoins
when you get a chance.

334
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,085
What?

335
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,519
So, this is way
under your budget.

336
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,656
Used to be a donut shop.
Well, a tire shop

337
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,291
- that sold donuts.
- Pretty rough.

338
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,626
I mean, I guess I could fix
the roof

339
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,294
and tear up the counters.

340
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,562
Do something about the smell.

341
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:17,997
This place is creepy.

342
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:21,133
I mean, I love it, because
it reminds me of the cafeteria

343
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,968
in a haunted nursing home,
but...

344
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,470
that's just me.

345
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,005
This is the last listing I have

346
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,673
that isn't an active crime
scene.

347
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:28,808
Hey, man, what happened?

348
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,776
I thought Jurassic Fork
was super popular.

349
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,111
We stretched ourselves too thin

350
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,013
by expanding to
a second location.

351
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,048
You opened another
dinosaur-themed restaurant?

352
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,217
No, another Steven
Spielberg-themed restaurant.

353
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,619
The German place downtown...
Schindler's Lunch.

354
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,888
I think you may have
misunderstood what people liked

355
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,223
about Jurassic Fork.

356
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,958
I actually think the space
is pretty cool.

357
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,860
Obviously, we'd had to move
this T-Rex, but...

358
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,962
No can do.
That's a load-bearing T-Rex.

359
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,464
This is really the last place
you have available?

360
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,035
Dang. Maybe Tom's Bistro
wasn't meant to be.

361
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,239
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, real quick.

362
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,074
Remember when you said
you would close up shop

363
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,110
- on the slogan thing?
- Yes.

364
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,578
You did do that, right?

365
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,114
You didn't somehow get the email
addresses for every person

366
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,915
who voted for the
"Stick up the butt" slogan

367
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,519
and then write each of them
a personalized heartfelt email

368
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,874
telling them
to do the right thing

369
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,155
and vote for a real slogan?

370
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,425
Are you crazy?
What a crazy talk you just did

371
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,960
with your funny words.

372
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,262
Well, someone wrote
those emails.

373
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,766
And we got about 300 complaints
and as a cherry on top

374
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,735
some hackers got really mad
about the invasion of privacy

375
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:32,171
and attacked the website.

376
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,708
Look what they did to Peebo.

377
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:38,444
He's wearing a hat
made of penises.

378
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,079
Oh, boy.

379
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:43,190
Well, I.T. is fixing
the website,

380
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:44,818
but it will be down
for about three days.

381
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,643
Well, no worries, I will handle

382
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,999
all of the overflow work
personally.

383
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:51,302
Parking tickets,
code violations...

384
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:52,937
- send them all to me.
- What's going on?

385
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,738
I don't know.
I spoke to grant

386
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:56,907
about the national parks job,
and he mentioned

387
00:14:56,942 --> 00:14:59,610
that's mostly big picture
planning and delegating,

388
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:01,745
and not very much
nitty-gritty,

389
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,847
hands-on stuff
that I love to do.

390
00:15:03,882 --> 00:15:06,183
I would miss that, very much.

391
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:09,386
I mean, have I really pulled
my last bloated raccoon carcass

392
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:10,588
from a public fountain?

393
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:11,989
But that's the whole point

394
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:14,525
of moving up the ladder,
you get to think bigger,

395
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,327
swim in a bigger pond.

396
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,529
You're having a public forum
on the slogan, right?

397
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:20,097
Use it as a test.

398
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:22,700
Hand the reins to someone else,
let them handle things

399
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:24,468
while you manage
from a distance.

400
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:25,803
Yeah. That's a good idea.

401
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:29,540
I guess I should practice...
delegating.

402
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:31,008
Ugh! Okay.

403
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:34,778
The public forum
will be run by...

404
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:37,081
Oh, no, I would not
have started the sentence

405
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:39,049
if I knew Larry
was the only one here.

406
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:41,819
Babe, if you can step back
and let Larry take control,

407
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,687
you can survive anything.

408
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:46,023
All right.
Larry, can you get in here?

409
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:47,825
I would love to.
Gosh darn it.

410
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:51,362
I-I somehow ran my belt through
a slat in this chair

411
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:54,565
so I'm kind of... I'm kind
of stuck to it now.

412
00:15:56,835 --> 00:15:58,168
Great.

413
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:03,747
You really shouldn't have dug
that out of the dumpster.

414
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:06,176
I had to. Also I had a banana
on the way over here.

415
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:07,678
Sorry.

416
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:10,347
I get why you don't want any
more to know about Duke Silver,

417
00:16:10,382 --> 00:16:12,082
and you don't have to worry.

418
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:13,951
You secret is safe with me.

419
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:15,619
To even it out,

420
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:17,788
I'm gonna tell you
all of my secrets.

421
00:16:17,822 --> 00:16:20,324
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

422
00:16:20,358 --> 00:16:22,526
I once forgot to brush
my teeth for five weeks.

423
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,961
I didn't actually sell
my last car.

424
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:25,236
I just forgot
where I parked it.

425
00:16:25,263 --> 00:16:26,697
I don't know who Al Gore is.

426
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,232
And at this point
I'm too afraid to ask.

427
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:29,667
When they say 2% milk,

428
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:32,369
I don't know what
the other 98% is.

429
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:33,871
When I was a baby,
my head was so big

430
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,673
scientists did experiments
on me.

431
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:36,841
I once threw beer at a swan,

432
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,243
and then it attacked
my niece Rebecca.

433
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:40,644
That'll do, Andrew.

434
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,047
You don't have to play
the unity concert.

435
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:46,150
But don't quit music.
Please.

436
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:54,024
- Tommy.
- Hey.

437
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,527
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

438
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,162
I just got excited about
the restaurant

439
00:16:58,196 --> 00:16:59,697
but I should probably call
my investor

440
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:01,665
and tell him we have a problem.

441
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,867
Well, I got you something
to cheer you up.

442
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:05,002
Watch cologne.

443
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:06,270
Cologne for watches.

444
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:07,271
Thanks.

445
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:09,640
Things used to make me
so happy.

446
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:12,743
But I've grown a lot
in the last year.

447
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,545
Now I just want one big thing,

448
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,413
my own restaurant,
named after me,

449
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:18,949
that makes me so much money
I can buy anything I want.

450
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:23,681
I should go.

451
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,616
I didn't want Tom to leave,

452
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:28,152
so I said all these bad things
about the restaurant,

453
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:29,754
so he wouldn't like them.

454
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:31,622
Damn, we should have
coordinated.

455
00:17:31,657 --> 00:17:33,617
I don't want to lose that
weird little elf either.

456
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,505
That's why I showed him
all those crappy places.

457
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:37,328
Oh, I thought you were
just bad at your job.

458
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:40,264
Sorry.
What should we do?

459
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,133
Let me call some people.

460
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:45,470
Hello, everyone, and welcome

461
00:17:45,504 --> 00:17:48,172
to a public forum to choose
our new town slogan.

462
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:51,409
I'm gonna hand things over
to Larry Gengurch,

463
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:55,279
who is 100% in charge.

464
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:56,848
Well, let's
just get started, huh?

465
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:57,882
I want to talk about...

466
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,485
Oh, it's the...
geez Louise...

467
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,053
This keeps happening.
I don't know why.

468
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:03,688
I think the slogan should be

469
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:05,823
"Pawnee, home of crackers,

470
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:08,826
the orangest goldfish
in Indiana."

471
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:09,827
- Okey-dokey.
- No.

472
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:10,868
Let me write it down.

473
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,964
- Who even needs a slogan?
- Well, now,

474
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:14,158
that is an interesting point.

475
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:16,234
No, that's my slogan idea.

476
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:17,502
"Who even needs a slogan?"

477
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:20,338
And then a big picture of me
flipping everybody off.

478
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:23,841
Let's keep our eye
on the ball here, Douche nation,

479
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:27,712
"Home of the stick up Leslie
Knope's butt."

480
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:29,013
Butt stick!

481
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:30,281
Butt stick! Butt stick!

482
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:31,549
Let's vote on it right now!

483
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,951
Butt stick!
Butt stick!

484
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,094
Okay. Who's next?
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:40,430
This slogan is gonna go on
every sign in town.

486
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,584
I think it should be
something real

487
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,620
that we can all be proud of.

488
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:46,321
I've lived in Pawnee
my whole life

489
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:50,025
and it could be a strange place,
but overall it's a warm,

490
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,430
and wonderful town.

491
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,697
My idea for a slogan is,
"When you're here,

492
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,231
then you're home."

493
00:18:56,266 --> 00:18:57,333
Well, that's lovely.

494
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,567
I actually had it printed up

495
00:18:58,601 --> 00:19:00,002
so we can see what
it would look like.

496
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:01,370
Oh, you...

497
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:03,272
Hm... there's... that's... that's
spelled wrong.

498
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,207
That should be "then",
t-h-e-n.

499
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,176
Stay strong.
Let them work it out.

500
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,544
And trust Larry.

501
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:09,978
Trust Larry?

502
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,213
Are you listening to yourself?

503
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,715
I like that slogan a lot.

504
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:16,151
But you made
a little mistake there.

505
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,556
- You see?
- Back off.

506
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,391
"You're" is spelled wrong.

507
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:24,860
It should be "y-o-u-r."

508
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:26,895
Oops, I didn't catch it.
Thank you.

509
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,330
No, no, no,
she made a possessive.

510
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:29,898
- She's getting further away.
- It's okay.

511
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,367
Okay, let's vote.

512
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:32,901
All those in favor.

513
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:35,471
Approved!

514
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,677
Man, the places that came
on the market today

515
00:19:41,711 --> 00:19:44,213
are way nicer than the listings
we saw yesterday.

516
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:47,082
I know, crazy, right?
Real estate.

517
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,584
This property
is under your budget,

518
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:50,753
and it's got everything
on this wish list you gave me.

519
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,254
Except the two helipads.

520
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:53,522
Does it have one helipad?

521
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:54,923
I don't know.

522
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,693
I like it, but... seems
a little small.

523
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,762
No, I think it just seems
small because

524
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,263
of all the heavy furniture.

525
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:02,965
But that part is really great.

526
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:05,234
The lighting is really cool.

527
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:07,636
I think this is the one.

528
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:09,638
You know, I think you're right.

529
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:10,706
I'll do it.

530
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,107
Thanks, April.
And, hey, bonus,

531
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:14,076
it's pretty close to city hall.

532
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,377
You guys are gonna be regulars.

533
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:17,246
I'll keep a table open for you.

534
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,715
And special thanks
to Leslie Knope

535
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:22,885
for once again bringing about
positive change to this town.

536
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,155
Pawnee, I present to you,
your new slogan.

537
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:29,158
You fixed the mistakes.

538
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:31,260
I held it together
for the entire meeting.

539
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:32,294
Let me have this one.

540
00:20:32,328 --> 00:20:34,563
I'm done micromanaging.
I promise.

541
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:37,633
Then I'm sure you are okay
with the fact

542
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,168
that they installed the sign

543
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:41,437
the wrong way
and it's welcoming you to Pawnee

544
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,538
as you're leaving.

545
00:20:42,572 --> 00:20:43,605
What?

546
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,841
No! Oh, son of a...

547
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,276
Hey, you passed the test.

548
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,544
Honestly,

549
00:20:48,578 --> 00:20:50,446
there's something else
I'm worried about.

550
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,247
The kind of work that I've been
doing all these years,

551
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:54,149
the nuts and bolts,
the grunt work,

552
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,851
that's the stuff I know
how to do.

553
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:57,786
What if I take
this national parks jobs

554
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,988
and I just... fail?

555
00:21:00,023 --> 00:21:02,091
- Hm.
- What if I'm not good at it?

556
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,125
Yeah.

557
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,096
Leslie, I love you, very much.

558
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,198
But this is the stupidest
thing you've ever said.

559
00:21:09,232 --> 00:21:11,433
You'd be amazing.

560
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,502
And everyone's gonna be in awe
of how amazing you are,

561
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:14,937
so just shut your month.

562
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:18,607
Hey,

563
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:19,775
are we leaving or entering?

564
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,711
We've been driving around
in circles.

565
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:25,014
You're...

566
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:30,828
