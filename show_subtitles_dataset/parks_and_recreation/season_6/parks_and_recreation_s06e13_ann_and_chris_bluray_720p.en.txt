1
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,468
Oh, ice cream sandwich
taste test!

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,236
That was our biggest fight.

3
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:09,888
- Hey, Knope.
- Harold.

4
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:12,124
You're breaking ground on
the Pawnee commons tonight?

5
00:00:12,158 --> 00:00:14,226
Public works
never signed off on that.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,861
Look, your office
was giving me a hard time,

7
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:17,746
so I had to call in
a few favors.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,915
I don't like it
when people go over my head.

9
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:21,499
Understood.
I will make a note of that.

10
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:22,467
Would you like a treat?

11
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:24,202
I run that department

12
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:27,639
and I do not appreciate...

13
00:00:27,674 --> 00:00:29,141
- Damn, that's really good.
- Right?

14
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:30,359
There's gonna be a lot
of these at the party.

15
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:31,460
- You should come by.
- I kno...

16
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:32,911
I get it.
I know what you're doing.

17
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:35,097
And I still... is there
a little crunch in there?

18
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:36,231
- Hazelnut.
- Ooh.

19
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:37,232
Ooh, right?

20
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:38,450
See you tonight.

21
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:40,552
Okay, well,
let's go set up this party.

22
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:41,803
April, thank you.

23
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:44,556
I know you may tease Ann,
but deep down inside

24
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,991
I can tell that you really care.

25
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:51,096
Ann's leaving town and saying
painful good-byes to loved ones.

26
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:54,566
Greatest day of my life!

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:07,425
Sync & corrections by honeybunny

28
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:18,507
Thank you all so much for
helping me with these boxes.

29
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:21,393
I'm just a little behind because
every time I start, I get...

30
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:23,995
a little emotional.

31
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:25,731
Hey, that box
has my name on it.

32
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:27,282
Hey, this one
has my name on it.

33
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:29,534
This one
has plates' name on it.

34
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:31,753
You have just found
your buddy boxes.

35
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:34,606
Each box contains a memento
of our friendship.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,907
I was gonna give them
to you later,

37
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:39,577
but there is no time
like the present.

38
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:41,646
Fun pun alert.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,665
A bronzed hamburger.

40
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:45,967
It's from our turkey versus
beef cook-off, remember?

41
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:47,402
You were a worthy adversary.

42
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:50,138
I would have preferred
a regular hamburger for eating,

43
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:52,040
but this is very nice.

44
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:54,643
2008 Indiana state audit
spreadsheets?

45
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:58,029
Man, that year was insane!

46
00:01:58,063 --> 00:01:59,943
That was the year you went
from being an auditor

47
00:01:59,966 --> 00:02:00,932
to a legend.

48
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,601
Whoa!

49
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:05,003
A picture of me officiating
Leslie and Ben's wedding.

50
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:07,539
And look, you can
just about see my head.

51
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:08,840
Thank you so much.

52
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:10,609
Snakejuice!

53
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:12,327
I thought these were destroyed
by the FDA.

54
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,579
I did have to go to a very
seedy location to find it,

55
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:17,783
but now I know where to go to
place a bet on horse fighting.

56
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,888
Okay, don't mention anything
about the groundbreaking to Ann.

57
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,072
Repeat that back to me.

58
00:02:24,123 --> 00:02:25,373
Tell Ann about
the groundbreaking,

59
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,575
frame Ann for murder,

60
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,126
release a deadly virus
into the water supply.

61
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:29,344
Good.
Oh!

62
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:32,114
Bon voyage, Ann.

63
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:33,748
My God, this is amazing.

64
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,916
That's sparkling cider.

65
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,808
Why is there a New Year's Eve
countdown clock

66
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:37,986
and the Easter bunny?

67
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,104
I don't know
when we're gonna be able

68
00:02:39,138 --> 00:02:40,939
to visit each other,
so just to be safe

69
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:43,475
this party is a celebration
of every event

70
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:44,976
that's gonna happen this year.

71
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:48,046
Your birthday, New Year's,
Chinese New Year's, flag day.

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,881
Ain't no party like
a Leslie Knope party

73
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:52,400
'cause a Leslie Knope party
is actually 30 parties.

74
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:54,453
Knope, you have
out-knoped yourself.

75
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:57,172
Seems like the party's
dying down. Weird.

76
00:02:57,206 --> 00:02:59,591
Ann, you probably wanna head
to Michigan forever,

77
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,294
so I snuck into your house
and packed a bag for you. Bye.

78
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:04,679
This is just a bunch
of bras and knives.

79
00:03:04,714 --> 00:03:06,431
And loose onions.

80
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:07,649
Okay, party!

81
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,100
Don't drink!
Have fun!

82
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:13,054
Hey, so we have a little
farewell gift for you.

83
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:15,574
We all pitched in
and got you a gift card

84
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:18,176
from that home store,
"Pots and Pans."

85
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:20,729
We have been on the prowl
for some amazing pots.

86
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:23,615
Well, that card's
for three pans.

87
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:25,950
Either way, this is great.

88
00:03:25,968 --> 00:03:27,302
You know what?

89
00:03:27,336 --> 00:03:28,736
We should get
to the good-bye party,

90
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:30,054
although I know
it's mostly for Ann.

91
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:32,290
Yeah, but there's, like,
one corner for you

92
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:33,975
and it's just carob cookies
and berries.

93
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,510
Carob cookies and berries

94
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:38,062
are literally my favorite
dessert alternative.

95
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,582
I'll go get changed.

96
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:43,218
Man, he put a lot of work
into our presents.

97
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:45,353
I feel kinda bad just
getting him a gift card.

98
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:47,572
I also shook his hand.
Twice.

99
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:49,341
Anything more than that
would be excessive.

100
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,276
Let's all put our heads
together and brainstorm.

101
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:53,028
We gotta send this dude off
with the perfect gift.

102
00:03:53,062 --> 00:03:54,946
I say we start
with the three "Cs,"

103
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:57,315
cashmere, concert tickets,
caboodles of cash.

104
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,684
I feel like those
are perfect gifts for you.

105
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:01,286
Those are perfect gifts
for anyone.

106
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,872
Ugh, I wish you guys were Donna!

107
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,692
I'm 100% sure
that I will not meet

108
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:09,477
another Donna Meagle
in Michigan.

109
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:10,812
I'm gonna miss you.

110
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,414
You know, I'm gonna miss you
too, Perkins.

111
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:14,182
But now that you're officially
out of the dating pool,

112
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:16,318
you know I'm gonna
run this town, right?

113
00:04:16,352 --> 00:04:17,736
Ooh.

114
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,839
Oh, yeah, you do not wanna
go down that road.

115
00:04:20,873 --> 00:04:21,890
Trust me, I tried.

116
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:23,441
Hi, Stephen.

117
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:24,442
Hey, Ann.

118
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:27,712
- Super cute baby bump.
- Thanks.

119
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:29,831
Good looking out.

120
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,651
Hey, Ron, have you seen April?

121
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:34,769
I've been mostly focused
on these ribs.

122
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:38,506
By the way, you're out of Easter
ham and Thanksgiving turkey.

123
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,641
Great party.

124
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,460
Hey.

125
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:43,445
Are you on the lot?

126
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,446
Is everything okay?

127
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,897
Uh, not really.

128
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,449
Public works put up a giant
padlock on the fence

129
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:51,269
and a sign that says
"No trespassing."

130
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,720
That probably
doesn't apply to us.

131
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:55,473
There's also a sign that says
"Especially Leslie Knope."

132
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,626
Well, Leslie Knope
is a very common name.

133
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,928
There's a professor in
Copenhagen named Leslie Knope.

134
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:01,713
They probably mean him.

135
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:02,845
Do they mean the professor?

136
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:05,850
Yeah,
there's a picture of you also.

137
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:08,353
And two huge security guards.

138
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:10,171
Holy mother of Malia!

139
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,473
And Sasha.

140
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:12,891
I love them both equally.

141
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:14,609
Okay, it's that stupid Harold
who's behind this.

142
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:18,196
Get here and we will
make a plan.

143
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,181
How long do I have to do this?

144
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,816
Until I say so, Orin!

145
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,930
Stay in character.

146
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:30,916
Leslie can't watch anything
with Julie Andrews in it

147
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,506
before bedtime because
it gets her too hyper.

148
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,457
Okay.

149
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:35,376
If Chris gets cranky
around noon,

150
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,161
just stuff some chia seeds
into a fig...

151
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,346
works every time.

152
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,179
Awesome, thank you.

153
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,815
Wow, we really picked
some intense people

154
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,884
- to spend our lives with, huh?
- Yeah.

155
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:46,385
Where's Leslie?
I haven't seen her in a while.

156
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:47,737
Oh, she's just running around

157
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:49,973
trying to pull off an elaborate,
thoughtful surprise for you.

158
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:51,557
- Of course.
- Where's Chris?

159
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,910
I told him that One Headlight
By the Wallflowers

160
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:58,331
isn't "dancing" music and he
said "Not with that attitude."

161
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,684
Of course.

162
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:05,321
Dude, Ann, you know
what I just remembered?

163
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:06,873
We used to date.

164
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,142
Yeah, we lived together
for two years.

165
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:10,910
I know, it's crazy, right?

166
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,462
Anyways, you're the best.

167
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:15,982
Have fun in Mexico.

168
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:17,467
Harold,
it is Leslie Knope again.

169
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:18,601
I know you are
screening my calls,

170
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:19,836
but if you could call me bac...

171
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,237
And his voicemail is full.

172
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:22,572
Did you have any luck?

173
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:23,823
Flipped through the bylaws.

174
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:24,824
I don't think
there's anything I can do.

175
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,326
What is the point
of being married

176
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,878
to a city manager if he can't
wield unfettered power

177
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:30,096
to crush my enemies?

178
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,147
Hopefully there are
a few other reasons.

179
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:32,916
- Yeah.
- Looks like we hit a wall.

180
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,918
Oh, God.

181
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:36,569
April?
Are you okay?

182
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,520
What's happening?

183
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:38,705
I'm just so scared

184
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:42,225
that this means that Ann
won't really leave.

185
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,777
Life, huh?

186
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:47,063
It's quite a ride.

187
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:49,966
Yes, Tom, it is.

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,118
I got you a going-away
present.

189
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:53,736
I'm deleting you from my phone.

190
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:56,122
You're finally free
of my animal magnetism.

191
00:06:56,156 --> 00:06:58,524
Maybe one day years from now
when we're both old

192
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,928
and Chris is dead,
you'll run into me somewhere.

193
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,447
I'll be opening
my latest mega club.

194
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:06,201
I'll see you there
on the street by yourself

195
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,152
and I'll tell
the bouncer/my bodyguard,

196
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:12,622
"Hey, that woman's way too old
to get into this club,

197
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:15,024
but why don't you
let her in the back?"

198
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,976
That's very generous.

199
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,277
Stay golden, sweetheart.

200
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,745
I'm gonna miss you too, Tom.

201
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:21,230
Shh.

202
00:07:21,265 --> 00:07:23,650
And you're kind
and you're thoughtful

203
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:25,501
and you're always such a delight
to have around.

204
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:28,938
I am sure you are going
to be an incredible mother.

205
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:30,823
Thanks, Larry.
That's nice.

206
00:07:30,857 --> 00:07:32,508
Good-bye, Ann.

207
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:35,912
I have enjoyed
parts of our time together.

208
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:39,849
Oh, God, Ron.

209
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:45,171
That was really something.

210
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:47,106
Okay, what do
we have for Chris?

211
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:49,742
I got this City of Pawnee mug.

212
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:51,427
Also, this cool jacket.

213
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,396
No, I think
that's Chris's jacket.

214
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,614
Okay, good,
then we know he likes it.

215
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,082
Catch up, Larry.

216
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,051
Okay, I found some old receipts

217
00:07:58,085 --> 00:07:59,719
from lunches we had together.

218
00:07:59,737 --> 00:08:00,687
Is that anything?

219
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,121
This is my contribution.

220
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:03,489
It says "Ron."

221
00:08:03,507 --> 00:08:04,807
Hey, guys, what's going on?

222
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:07,393
Oh, we're just giving you
a bunch of cool gifts.

223
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:08,361
No, God... oh... God.

224
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:10,380
Get your hopes up, Chris.

225
00:08:10,414 --> 00:08:11,514
Let's see what's in here.

226
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:13,816
Some assorted items.

227
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:16,302
And... some pieces of paper.

228
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:18,054
Boom, nailed it.
All right.

229
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:21,941
Now we can start
enjoying this party.

230
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:25,011
Leslie, this is the most
incredible event

231
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,429
that has ever been thrown.

232
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,898
There is a pilgrim line dancing
with a box of candies.

233
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,384
Why do you look so bummed out?

234
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:33,669
We were planning a surprise
groundbreaking

235
00:08:33,704 --> 00:08:34,904
at Pawnee commons for you.

236
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,522
You know, an actual beginning

237
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,041
to the project
that brought us together.

238
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:40,593
But now we can't do it because
Harold is such a jerk face.

239
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:42,261
He put a barbed wire fence
around the lot

240
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:43,946
and now it's not happening.

241
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:45,281
I'm sorry, Ann.

242
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:47,733
First of all, don't apologize.

243
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,836
And second of all, screw Harold.

244
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,004
If I learned one thing
from Leslie Knope

245
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,006
it is we do not take "No"
for an answer.

246
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,242
Anything is possible
if we work hard enough.

247
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,510
- Let's do it.
- Oh, my God!

248
00:08:57,544 --> 00:08:59,078
Ann Perkins to the rescue.

249
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:00,430
Okay, hands in, everybody.

250
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:01,597
One, two, three.

251
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:02,598
- Groundbreaking!
- Let's go!

252
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:03,966
Dark forces, arise!

253
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:05,417
Okay, I didn't plan
what we were all gonna say.

254
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:07,037
That's my bad.
Here we go, Ann. Let's go.

255
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:13,009
Okay, now to ring the bell.

256
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:14,582
Bust in unannounced.

257
00:09:14,617 --> 00:09:18,336
Love it!

258
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:19,421
Harold.

259
00:09:19,455 --> 00:09:20,422
What the hell, Knope?

260
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:21,506
We need the key to the fence

261
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,924
that you put up
on the Sullivan Street lot.

262
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,642
You snuck around
behind my back.

263
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:26,778
I told you I didn't like that.
Forget it.

264
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:28,363
Come on, Harold, look.

265
00:09:28,397 --> 00:09:30,448
This is a great opportunity
you have right now.

266
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,550
Just think of us as your genies

267
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,252
who can give you
anything you want.

268
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:35,570
Nothing gross.

269
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:39,107
Okay, yeah,
there is something I want.

270
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:40,608
Super fizzy fruity pop.

271
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:41,926
Sorry?

272
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:44,846
Sweetums used to stock our
office with free sodas

273
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:47,098
as a promotional thing,
but that Kathryn Pinewood lady

274
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,616
just took 'em away.

275
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:51,803
If you can get us our free sodas
back, I'll get you a key.

276
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:53,971
- Deal.
- Easy.

277
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,373
It is not easy.

278
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,542
Kathryn Pinewood is the person
on earth who hates me the most.

279
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:58,777
Well, luckily,
you're with the person on earth

280
00:09:58,811 --> 00:09:59,811
who loves you the most.

281
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:01,196
Too cheesy?
No, it's perfect.

282
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:02,168
I love you.
Don't leave.

283
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:03,581
Come on.

284
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:05,683
Donna, you are
a remarkable woman,

285
00:10:05,717 --> 00:10:06,985
and I just wanted to say

286
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,503
that I've always
thought of you as family.

287
00:10:08,537 --> 00:10:10,805
I just wanna say that I've
always thought you were hot.

288
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,057
Yes, I know.

289
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,074
April...

290
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:15,076
Yeah, you saw a lot of
potential in me,

291
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,628
I'm like a daughter to you,
and it was a treat

292
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:19,147
to watch me blossom.

293
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:20,915
Blah blah blah, bye.

294
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,302
That is remarkably close
to what I was going to say.

295
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,206
Also, I'm proud of you.

296
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:32,644
Donna,
are you grabbing my butt?

297
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:33,595
Can you blame me?

298
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,847
No!

299
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:37,348
Sorry, can't help you ladies.

300
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:39,501
I don't have time for disgraced
former politicians

301
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:40,602
and unmarried preggos.

302
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,753
Oh, Kathryn, always a delight.

303
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,038
Listen, I know
that you and Leslie

304
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:45,707
have had your disagreements
in the past,

305
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:48,593
but we really need the key,
and we can only get the key

306
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,911
if we get the sodas.
Please?

307
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:51,463
I don't see why I should do
you any favors.

308
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:54,849
I mean, if you were still
a city councilor, maybe.

309
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,068
But I seem to remember
you were recalled.

310
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:58,036
Is that right?

311
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,671
- How dare yo...
- Okay, Leslie.

312
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:01,990
Please.
It's not worth it.

313
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:02,957
For you.

314
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:04,542
For me, I don't care.

315
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,177
What the hell?

316
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:07,428
Yeah, Pinewood, that's right.

317
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,347
I'm pregnant
and I have you in a headlock.

318
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:11,299
And if you try to fight back,
I will sue you.

319
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,751
Unless you tell us how to get
those sodas right now.

320
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:15,770
Okay, fine.

321
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:17,572
Sweetums
has been desperately trying

322
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:19,424
to get a local
celebrity spokesman

323
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,592
to endorse
their new sports drink.

324
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,193
So if you can
make that happen somehow,

325
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:24,963
they'll give you
whatever you want.

326
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:26,898
Damn, Perkins.

327
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:29,951
Okay, who does Sweetums want
as their spokesperson?

328
00:11:30,002 --> 00:11:32,637
They already tried to get me
to endorse that sports drink.

329
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:33,638
I said "No."

330
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:35,206
They want me dunking
on the label.

331
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:36,591
When is this town gonna realize

332
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,776
that I'm more than a former
high school basketball star?

333
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:42,213
I don't think this new sports
drink is even about basketball.

334
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:44,048
It's called
"Sweetums dunktastic

335
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,184
three-point B-ball blast"

336
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:48,369
the slogan is
"It's all about basketball."

337
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,772
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to find yourself

338
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:53,908
some other famous pawneean.

339
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:57,762
We know that you were already
approached by Sweetums

340
00:11:57,796 --> 00:12:00,114
and you said "No," but is there
any way you would reconsider?

341
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,249
I'm sorry, Miss Knope.

342
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:03,618
There is such a thing as
journalistic integrity,

343
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:07,822
and it is something that I have
as a journalist with integrity.

344
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,624
It's really important, Perd.

345
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,726
Please?
Come on.

346
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:12,944
For old time's sake.

347
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:14,412
Well, the story of that appeal

348
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:15,997
is it was heartfelt.

349
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:20,451
And in response to that appeal,
I respond: Okay.

350
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:23,872
For old time's sake?

351
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:26,391
Does that mea... no!

352
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:29,060
- Ann, you tricky minx.
- Yep.

353
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:31,162
- I went on a date with Perd.
- What?

354
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,764
It was during that
"explore my freedom

355
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:33,965
as a single woman" phase.

356
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:36,334
- Wow.
- We just had a drink.

357
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:39,170
And at the end he said,
"I am going to kiss you now

358
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:41,022
by putting my mouth
on your mouth."

359
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:42,156
And then I ran away.

360
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,958
It was absolutely
the right call.

361
00:12:43,993 --> 00:12:45,710
Well, we could
just tell him the truth

362
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:48,012
that we feel bad that we didn't
get him anything nice.

363
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,530
Tell the truth?

364
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:50,949
That's hilarious.
No.

365
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,583
We tell him
we had the perfect gift,

366
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,185
but we were robbed at gunpoint.

367
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,853
"Chris, he had a gun.

368
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,355
He took all the gifts."

369
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,540
Now Chris feels bad,
he's buying us gifts.

370
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:01,676
Next thing you know,
Tommy's got a new watch.

371
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,261
Again, I don't see the problem.

372
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,247
I shook the man's hand.
Twice.

373
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:09,984
Guys, look what I got at
the president's day booth.

374
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:13,922
Ask not what your country
can do for you.

375
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,941
From Family Guy, right?

376
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,110
Listen, Chris, we have
to tell you something.

377
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:22,546
We feel bad because you got us
such thoughtful gifts

378
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:26,751
and we got you three pans
and a bag of nothing.

379
00:13:26,785 --> 00:13:29,387
Guys, I don't need
anything from you.

380
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,389
My buddy boxes
are about the past,

381
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:33,808
but let's focus on the future.

382
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:35,927
Because we're always
gonna be friends.

383
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:39,414
And just the fact that you feel
bad about your bag of nothing

384
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:40,381
proves that.

385
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:41,683
To the future.

386
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:42,684
- Hear, hear.
- To the future.

387
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:44,068
- To the future.
- Cheers.

388
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:46,621
- I have an idea.
- Future.

389
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:50,525
Don't you ladies ever knock?

390
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,410
No.
Okay, so we got Perd Hapley

391
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:53,544
to sign on with Sweetums,

392
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,096
which means that
you get your sodas back,

393
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,431
which means that we get our key.

394
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:57,582
Okay? Everything's here
in writing.

395
00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:59,033
Now call off your guards.

396
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,620
Okay.
Fine.

397
00:14:02,638 --> 00:14:04,722
You two are a couple of real
pains in the ass.

398
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,024
You know that?

399
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:08,026
Harold, your tiny brain
could not understand this,

400
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,527
but that is the best compliment

401
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:12,013
you could ever give the two
women standing in front of you.

402
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:13,348
Bye, Harold.

403
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,367
Victory at last.
Whoo!

404
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:18,303
- All right.
- You're all set.

405
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:19,537
Okay, I am gonna call

406
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:22,006
the official ceremonial
ribbon cutting guy,

407
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,274
'cause I think
we may have missed him.

408
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,094
What are you doing?

409
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:27,145
It's for the raccoons.

410
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,429
You have to hiss really loud

411
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,747
and stomp your feet
so they'll leave you alone.

412
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:31,649
And if one comes close,
make yourself really large

413
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,668
like a puffer fish.

414
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:34,802
Pawnee raccoons.

415
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:37,121
That is one thing
I will not miss.

416
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,723
Well, Michigan has wolverines.

417
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:40,908
Maybe they'll eat your toes.

418
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:44,095
So how long do you think
you'll stay in Pawnee for?

419
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:45,096
I don't know.

420
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,264
We like it here.

421
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:50,034
I made Andy promise that someday
we'll move to Transylvania,

422
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:52,236
but that probably won't happen
till we're, like, 100.

423
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:54,639
Well, for what it's worth,

424
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,308
I'm really happy
that you and Andy are married.

425
00:14:57,342 --> 00:14:58,275
Why?

426
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:01,462
Why?
Because I love him

427
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:03,381
and I love you.

428
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:05,900
Why wouldn't I be happy?

429
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:07,235
I love you too.

430
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:08,736
What's that?

431
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,922
I love you too.

432
00:15:10,956 --> 00:15:12,990
I-I couldn't... I couldn't
quite hear you.

433
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:15,176
Please don't make me say it.
Please.

434
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,162
My going-away present to you

435
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,133
will be that I do not make you
audibly say that you love me.

436
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,169
Thank you.

437
00:15:27,506 --> 00:15:29,974
- What's happening here?
- Okay, Leslie's coming back.

438
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:31,888
- Get off me, wench!
- Did I miss a nice moment?

439
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:32,894
- No.
- Yes, you did.

440
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:34,612
Oh, good.

441
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,347
Guys, what are you doing here?

442
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:40,155
Come in.

443
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:42,411
You caught me before
my first run of the day.

444
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:44,371
I call it my "beat the sun" run.

445
00:15:44,373 --> 00:15:46,286
It's a race between me
and the sun.

446
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,176
Well, we got one more
gift for you.

447
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:52,546
It's quarter-sawn zebra wood
adjoined by floating tenons

448
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:54,664
to the black walnut
corner posts.

449
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,400
Finished with a wiping varnish

450
00:15:56,402 --> 00:15:58,585
that's a secret
Swanson family recipe.

451
00:15:58,587 --> 00:16:02,356
Handmade at my woodshop,
and you are correct.

452
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:03,940
It is gorgeous.

453
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:06,476
You're starting a new life
with your new family,

454
00:16:06,478 --> 00:16:08,362
so it's an empty buddy box

455
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,697
to fill with memories
for your little buddy.

456
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:12,699
Or... twizzlers.

457
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:14,684
That's the beautiful thing
about a box.

458
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:18,405
We all burned
our initials in, see?

459
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:22,292
Wait a minute,
who's G-J-L-G-G?

460
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:24,211
That's Garry Jerry Larry
Gergich Gengurch.

461
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:26,413
I burned in all my names.

462
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:27,631
I really... I didn't
know what to do.

463
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,083
Well, um...

464
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:32,252
Thank you.

465
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:35,705
Um, this tear, um,

466
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:40,210
caused by the overwhelming
thoughtfulness of my friends

467
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:43,063
will be my baby's first memory.

468
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:45,899
Salt water will warp the wood.

469
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:50,153
So keep your tears in your eyes
where they belong.

470
00:16:50,155 --> 00:16:51,655
Will do, Ron Swanson.

471
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:54,141
Can I still call you

472
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:56,326
when I have thoughts
on Jennifer Aniston's future?

473
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:57,894
Not if I call you first.

474
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:58,912
And can we still
be on the phone

475
00:16:58,914 --> 00:17:00,947
for every state
of the Union address

476
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,367
and every Oscar
red carpet coverage

477
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:05,919
and every single viewing
of Tootsie?

478
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,170
Of course.

479
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:09,790
Oh, Ann Perkins.

480
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,509
You perfect sunflower.

481
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:15,011
You totally changed me,
you know?

482
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,431
You taught me
how to balance my life,

483
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:20,717
- how to be patient.
- Mm...

484
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,469
- How to be more patient.
- Yeah, that's better.

485
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:24,921
How to throw bureaucratic
caution to the wind

486
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,606
when it came to Ben.

487
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:29,393
But most importantly,
you taught me

488
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,695
that I can't pull off
a tulip skirt.

489
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:33,730
It's just not your shape.

490
00:17:37,569 --> 00:17:40,987
Well, I don't think this
ceremonial ribbon cutting guy

491
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:41,988
is gonna make it.

492
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,990
Either he flaked or he tripped

493
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:46,543
and impaled himself
on his own giant scissors.

494
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:48,295
We wait for no man.

495
00:17:48,297 --> 00:17:49,629
Let's do this.

496
00:17:49,631 --> 00:17:52,382
One, two, three!

497
00:17:57,506 --> 00:17:59,139
All right, I got my park.

498
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:00,257
That's all I wanted from you.

499
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,258
Friendship over.

500
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:05,061
Don't even
joke about that, Ann.

501
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:10,851
It was your idea
to get me that box.

502
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:12,936
Ah, it was a group effort.

503
00:18:12,938 --> 00:18:14,604
But it had that trademark

504
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:18,108
Ben Wyatt mix of thoughtful
and resourceful.

505
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,645
You are literally the best
friend that I will ever have.

506
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:27,751
You too, man.

507
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:33,340
Leslie Knope.

508
00:18:33,342 --> 00:18:34,841
Chris Traeger.

509
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,877
I just wanna say
that getting to know you

510
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,929
and watching you work

511
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:42,165
has been one of the greatest
experiences

512
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:45,218
of my life... that and working
with Dr. Richard Nygard.

513
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,721
Sure, and I just
want you to know

514
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:50,190
that I thought
there was no man on earth

515
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:52,642
good enough for Ann Perkins.

516
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:54,478
- And I still think that.
- Right.

517
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,680
But if there is no one
actually good enough for her,

518
00:18:57,682 --> 00:19:01,701
you are pretty damn close.

519
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,028
Okay, well, this is normal.

520
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,029
No big deal.

521
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:14,965
- Drive safe.
- We will.

522
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,666
I packed you some sandwiches

523
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:18,969
and some caffeine free iced tea.

524
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:21,204
So... oh, and there's a mix CD
that I made

525
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:23,173
already loaded in your car.

526
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:24,707
There's a lot of
Sarah McLanahan,

527
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:26,176
so, Chris, I apologize.

528
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:28,178
Things are gonna get emotional.

529
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,849
I love you.

530
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:36,886
I love you too.

531
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:52,369
Breakfast, Knope?

532
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:55,271
Oh, I don't know.

533
00:19:55,273 --> 00:19:56,540
Come on.

534
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,608
There has never been a sadness

535
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,794
that can't be cured
by breakfast food.

536
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,629
That's fair.

537
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:04,915
Someone else is gonna
have to drive though.

538
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,616
My eyes are basically
useless right now.

539
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:07,884
I'm on it.

540
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:09,352
Shotgun!
I called shotgun!

541
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:11,137
- You're all nailed.
- I call sitting on your lap.

542
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:12,522
You can't... I... double shotgun!

543
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:13,773
We call double shotgun!

544
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,091
How come people
don't do that more often?

545
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:16,259
It's illegal.

546
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:17,894
Raise you hand
if you want waffles.

547
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:19,145
I'm eating waffles.

548
00:20:19,147 --> 00:20:21,147
Bacon and eggs,
please and thank you.

549
