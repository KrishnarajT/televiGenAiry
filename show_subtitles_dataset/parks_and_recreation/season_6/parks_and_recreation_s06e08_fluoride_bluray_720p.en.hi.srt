1
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:14,918
We're gonna have some fun tonight, Pawnee!

2
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,586
Who is ready to play 60?

3
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:18,904
Everybody on the field!

4
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:21,107
Yeah!

5
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:24,154
The NFL has a campaign
to try to get kids active

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,491
for 60 minutes per day.

7
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:26,926
And so we bused in

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,911
a hundred lucky,
little buggers from Pawnee.

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,497
And they are gonna get a chance
to play with the Colts.

10
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,282
Oh! Come on, Reggie!

11
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:34,596
I told you to run a button hook.

12
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:35,801
- I did, Leslie.
- Okay.

13
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:36,936
I guess you would know.

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,854
A pleasure to see you again,
Mr. Luck.

15
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,105
We met briefly last year

16
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:42,658
- at our friend's bachelor party.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

17
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,843
How are you?

18
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,060
I normally don't answer
that question,

19
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:46,679
but since I respect
your talent,

20
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,097
I will tell you...
I am fine.

21
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,082
Hi, I'm April.

22
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:54,336
I stole your wallet.

23
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,704
You guys are weird.

24
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,940
Thank you.

25
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,941
What's up, girl?

26
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,276
Keep walking, 98.

27
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,095
You don't even want to talk
to that guy?

28
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,581
- He plays for the NFL.
- He's a linebacker.

29
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,201
Skill positions only
for Donna Meagle.

30
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,485
I got my Colts beanie,

31
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,453
my Colts scarf,

32
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:12,872
I got the Colts grill going,

33
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:15,391
and the crowning glory...
Colts slippies.

34
00:01:15,425 --> 00:01:17,142
How are you going
to run in those?

35
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:19,895
"Run"? Tommy doesn't run.

36
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:21,197
That's your guys' job.

37
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:24,300
Now, uh, let's go fetch
this football throw, fellas.

38
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,937
I love sports.

39

40
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,743
Check it out, Tom...
the Eagleton reservoir.

41
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,810
Isn't it stunning?

42
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,062
It's just a big dumb pond.

43
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,680
This morning I saw
a YouTube clip

44
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:56,315
of a little puppy riding
a motorcycle.

45
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,083
So my bar for "stunning"
is pretty high.

46
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,869
What if I told you that
this water has fluoride in it?

47
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,888
Then I would tell you
the puppy had a little side car

48
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,673
with a piggy in it
named Hampton.

49
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,892
First of all,
send me a link to that video.

50
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:09,111
But more importantly,
now that we have access

51
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,747
to the Eagleton reservoir
and the water-treatment supply,

52
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:13,749
Pawnee is going to have fluoride
in its water

53
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,534
for the first time
in our history,

54
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,119
our oral history.

55
00:02:17,153 --> 00:02:18,420
Nailed it.

56
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:20,495
Of course I'm upset
that I lost the recall election.

57
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:23,058
But I'm just gonna spend
the remainder of my term

58
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:25,828
cramming in as many
good projects as I can.

59
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:28,163
Lame duck?
Try flame duck...

60
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:31,066
'cause this duck is on fire.

61
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:32,518
It's hard doing
stupid government stuff

62
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,986
now that Rent-a-Swag's closed.

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,854
I'm a businessman.
That's what I was born to do.

64
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,073
Well, look, you just got
to make the most of the job

65
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,541
that you have.

66
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,243
Like, take that trash collector.

67
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,978
It's not the most glamorous job
in the world,

68
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:44,897
but he's doing it
with a smile on his face.

69
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,649
Oh, my God.

70
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,951
He's not wearing any pants.
What's wrong with him?

71
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:50,786
- Let's get out of here.
- He's smiling at us!

72
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,888
Let's go! Run!

73
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,890
What's so exciting, everyone?

74
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,742
Look what Ron made.
It's amazing.

75
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,827
Several months ago,
I was on a walk

76
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,646
and found my crib tree.

77
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,132
I approached the tree,
murdered it,

78
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,067
left it to cure in my woodshop,

79
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,702
and have begun working it
into a crib

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,387
for my upcoming child.

81
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,223
Ron Swanson,
you cannot use this crib.

82
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,525
You're ignoring every known
crib-safety standard.

83
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,244
It's all covered in
the parenting book I'm reading.

84
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,313
Are you going to crawl my way?
By Lenny Kravitz.

85
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,648
My crib will be safe
because I'm building it

86
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:21,100
with my own two hands.

87
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,568
I bought my crib
in Bloomington,

88
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,170
and I am confident
that it is literally

89
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:27,423
the safest crib
in the explored universe.

90
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,424
Let me take you there,

91
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,908
and you can talk
to the salesperson.

92
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,076
Counteroffer...

93
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,245
you take me nowhere,
and I talk to no one.

94
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,330
Counter-counteroffer...

95
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:35,964
you come with me,
or I make you attend

96
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:37,966
a four-hour fax cover-sheet
protocol meeting.

97
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,786
Either way, it's a win for me.

98
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,756
Next on the docket is
a vote to approve

99
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,841
the Pawnee-Eagleton
reservoir merger.

100
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,226
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

101
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,312
We're just goosing our
water supply with fluoride?

102
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:51,646
I mean, come on.

103
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,632
Are we really gonna force
every Pawnee resident

104
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,418
to ingest a chemical
we know nothing about?

105
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,553
Fluoride is used
by the communists

106
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,055
to control our minds.

107
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,523
No, it's not.

108
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,841
Fluoride can control minds?

109
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,811
Like, you can use it
to make ladies do stuff?

110
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,525
How am I the one
that is getting booted off

111
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,447
of this city council?

112
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,399
Okay, fluoride is safe,

113
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,700
it is good for you,

114
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,920
and almost every town
in America uses it.

115
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:16,121
Ah, all right.

116
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,356
You got me.

117
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:18,857
I don't want fluoride
in the water

118
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:21,460
because I'm a dentist,
and I like cavities.

119
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,928
Yeah, that is not
a valid reason.

120
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,212
Pawnee's cavity problem

121
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,031
is why a small-town dentist,

122
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:30,119
like me, can afford
such a boss ride.

123
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,471
Got an Asian girl
to sit in it once.

124
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,740
Why did we come out here?

125
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,224
Come on, Jamm.

126
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,293
Fluoride in the water...
it's a no-brainer.

127
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:39,661
Can't you just let me
have this one?

128
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,996
No can do, Knopey.

129
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,098
As a matter of fact,
I would like to propose

130
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,818
my own bill...
the Pawnee Clean Water Bill,

131
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,287
which prohibits adding anything

132
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:51,072
to our water supply forever.

133
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,875
Jamm's not going to be able

134
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,277
to kill this reservoir merger,
is he?

135
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:57,846
On my side, I have facts,
science, and reason.

136
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,314
All he has
is fear-mongering.

137
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,216
Oh, my God, he's gonna win.

138
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,618
Yeah, people get jittery
about stuff like this.

139
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,771
Remember last year
when no one would get flu shots

140
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,190
'cause there was a rumor
they turned you European?

141
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,691
Well,
I'll figure something out.

142
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,126
Oh, Jessica's here.
I better go.

143
00:05:11,161 --> 00:05:12,995
- Okay, bye.
- Hey, sugar butt.

144
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,632
Some lardos in Muncie ate
tainted Sweetums toffee sticks

145
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,451
and diarrhea'd so much,
they ended up in the hospital.

146
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,452
Ugh.

147
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,620
Can we give their school,

148
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,572
like, a new seesaw
or something?

149
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,573
Yeah.

150
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,708
Thanks.

151
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,144
The new site looks good.
Nice work.

152
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:31,213
Oh, my God.
These dogs are so cute.

153
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,148
I want to throw up
and kill myself.

154
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,418
Animal control had to take in
all the pets from Eagleton.

155
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,637
And Crazy Craig used to run
all their shelters,

156
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,522
so he helped me make
an adoption website

157
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:41,556
for all the dogs.

158
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:42,858
If you can look at that site

159
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,197
and not want to take home
50 dogs,

160
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,912
you're basically
a war criminal.

161
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,014
See the way that dog

162
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:50,298
is rolling around in a puddle?

163
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,568
That's something Andy does
when he gets hot.

164
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,935
Oh, my God, you're right.

165
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,003
That is so Andy.

166
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:56,404
Oh, my God.
That dog is totally...

167
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,756
Tom!

168
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,007
I don't know why.
It doesn't look like him.

169
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,442
But it just is.

170
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:01,843
It's like the dog is
the essence of Tom.

171
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,362
Okay, important meeting

172
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:04,780
in the conference room
right now.

173
00:06:04,814 --> 00:06:07,315
We are going to all pick
our spirit dogs.

174
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,967
Oh, I've got to pick up Gayle
at the airport.

175
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,585
Larry, I swear to God,

176
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,254
if you leave right now,
we will make your spirit dog

177
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,805
a miniature schnauzer.

178
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:15,407
- Is that bad?
- Yes!

179
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,042
Get in there!

180
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,211
Ann found this place.

181
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,013
It's where we bought
our "Sounds of Nature" machine.

182
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,632
You bought a machine
that replicates

183
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,300
an open window?

184
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,301
Frasier!
Chris Traeger.

185
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,486
Do you remember me?

186
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,937
I came in here looking
for the Vanna White book

187
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,305
on child care...

188
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,941
I'd like to solve the puzzle
of parenting.

189
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,009
Could you show my friend, Ron,

190
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,611
that amazing crib
that you sold me?

191
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,046
The Babylove L'il Sweetheart
Safe 4 Ever and Ever model.

192
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,731
Oh, yeah,
that thing is a deathtrap.

193
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,383
- I'm sorry?
- Just found out this morning...

194
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,518
it's being recalled.

195
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:44,386
They found maxicylofentabol
in the glue.

196
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,621
Is that good?
It sounds bad.

197
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,706
It burned off my fingernails.

198
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,009
I'll be in the car.

199
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,646
Councilwoman Leslie Knope
wants to put fluoride,

200
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:57,099
which is a chemical,
into your drinking water.

201
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,700
You know what else is
a chemical?

202
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:00,986
Strychnine and cyanide.

203
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:02,103
- What?
- And dirt...

204
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,606
and rust and even broken glass.

205
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,174
Exactly.

206
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,759
You definitely understand
what chemicals are, Perd.

207
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,946
I would suggest if you want
to contact the psychopath

208
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,765
that wants to turn your kids
into bad-at-math,

209
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,934
communist fluoride zombies,

210
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,836
well, just call the number
at the bottom of your screen.

211
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,939
Leslie Knope.

212
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,858
Stop right there.
You know what?

213
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:23,942
Fluoride protects your teeth,

214
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,811
and it's perfectly healthy
for you.

215
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,263
Well, if Jamm says that,
then he is a lying idiot,

216
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,816
and if you believe it,
then so are you.

217
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,117
Whoa.

218
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,952
You just talked to that person
like I talk to you.

219
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,120
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

220
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:38,490
What are they gonna do,
kick me out of office?

221
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,075
Why did it take me so long
to realize this?

222
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:42,444
There are no consequences
to my actions anymore.

223
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,447
No matter what I do, literally
nothing bad can happen to me.

224
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,416
I'm like
a white, male U.S. senator.

225
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:52,387
Fluoride is going
into the water, moron.

226
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:55,457
Oh. Hey, mom.
Sorry.

227
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,893
Because all it does
is prevent cavities!

228
00:07:57,927 --> 00:07:59,428
God!

229
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,563
I expected more from you.

230
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,141
Right.
I'm a loose cannon.

231
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:07,878
We need to fight
fire with fire.

232
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:09,981
I call a town hall meeting,
I gather everyone together,

233
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,449
I distribute the binders,

234
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:14,969
but now the binders are
bright yellow!

235
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,637
Om!

236
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,042
- Too extreme?
- Too nothing.

237
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:22,877
Look, Jamm's
already ruined fluoride.

238
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:24,095
Everyone's scared of it.

239
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,413
What if we just called it
something else?

240
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:26,564
What do you mean?

241
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:27,731
I mean we rebrand.

242
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,333
No one cared
about Calvin Broadus

243
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:32,169
until he started calling
himself Snoop Doggy Dogg.

244
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:33,604
Then when people got tired
of that,

245
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,638
he went by Snoop Dogg,

246
00:08:34,656 --> 00:08:36,290
and now he's Snoop Lion.

247
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:38,526
What's he gonna be
in ten years... Snoop Laser Snake?

248
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,810
Who knows?

249
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:41,712
What are you saying...
we need to sex up fluoride?

250
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,813
I don't know, Tom.

251
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:44,448
It's a pretty sexy topic
already.

252
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,034
Leslie, you got to give people
something to get excited about.

253
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:48,336
You told me to make
the most of my job.

254
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:49,604
I'm good at this stuff.

255
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:51,922
Now, are you
a loose cannon or not?

256
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,491
Yeah.

257
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,409
I'm as loose as a goose.

258
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:56,877
Do your thing, Tom.

259
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,546
Aw.

260
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:00,681
Now, remember,
it's about finding a dog

261
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:01,866
that captures your spirit.

262
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,702
See? This is Craig.

263
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:06,420
Oh, no!
That is insane!

264
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:08,506
I will burn this place
to the ground

265
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,007
if you pick that one!

266
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,442
Okay, good choice.

267
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:13,277
You guys, Leslie.

268
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:14,629
Yes!
And...

269
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,080
Ron Swanson.

270
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,548
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

271
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,650
- This is Larry.
- That's great.

272
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,652
Bingo. Donna.
Nailed it.

273
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,170
Ooh.

274
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:26,524
Because you're pretty
and you like makeup and stuff.

275
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:28,309
Game over.

276
00:09:31,546 --> 00:09:34,966
Ron, I want to do things
the Swanson way.

277
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,317
Wonderful.

278
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,235
First rule...
no conversation lasts longer

279
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,004
than 100 total words.

280
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,373
You have used 9.
I have used 20.

281
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,841
- Continue.
- Fun.

282
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:46,010
I'd like you to teach me
to build a crib.

283
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:48,329
Why do you need to build
your own crib?

284
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,714
Because I no longer trust
anything

285
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:51,349
other than my own two hands.

286
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,417
It is debilitating,
but exciting.

287
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,720
Okay, we'll go to my woodshop
at lunch.

288
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:57,204
Wonderful.
Look at us...

289
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:59,173
both standing
on the cusp of fatherhood.

290
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,975
I know we haven't spent
a lot of time together,

291
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,727
- but...
- 100.

292
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,031
All right, so, in conclusion...

293
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,199
fluoride, chemical,

294
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,618
tiny genitals, misinformation,

295
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:14,622
panic, death, Jenny McCarthy.

296
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,508
Well, I don't know, councilman.

297
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,843
That was a little dry.

298
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,844
What do you say
we have some fun, huh?

299
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:22,747
Check this.

300
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:24,699
Plain water?
Yuck.

301
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,417
I'm bored.

302
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:27,584
Then try this.

303
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,022
What the...

304
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,157
what just happened?

305
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,459
That water contains
teeth dazzler,

306
00:10:35,477 --> 00:10:36,717
which makes your teeth stronger

307
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:38,863
and starts a party
in your mouth.

308
00:10:51,977 --> 00:10:54,562
What?
Fluoride's boring, guys.

309
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:55,563
Boo!

310
00:10:55,597 --> 00:10:57,331
Welcome to T-dazzle.

311
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,749
It's not a chemical.

312
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,151
It's an aquatic-based
social-media oral experience.

313
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:03,454
Everyone who tweets
at T-dazzle in the next hour

314
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:06,223
will be entered to win
an exciting plain blue T-shirt.

315
00:11:06,257 --> 00:11:08,209
I say "T,"
you say "dazzle."

316
00:11:08,243 --> 00:11:09,660
- "T."
- Dazzle.

317
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:10,628
- "T."
- Dazzle.

318
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:11,796
- "T."
- Dazzle.

319
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,197
Thank you for
the woodworking lesson, Ron.

320
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,449
This whole crib-recall thing
has got me

321
00:11:15,484 --> 00:11:16,584
literally rethinking everything

322
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,119
I thought I knew
about parenting.

323
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,503
What sleep method
will you be using...

324
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:21,322
Ferber, Sears?

325
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,507
Swanson method,

326
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,359
where you close
your eyes and fall asleep.

327
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,329
I really wish Ron would engage,

328
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:31,916
but he exudes so much wisdom
that I can learn parenting tips

329
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,584
simply by being
in his presence.

330
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:36,604
Someone like Ron is teaching
even when they're not teaching.

331
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,122
Does that make sense?

332
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:41,158
My anxiety has kept me up
for over 50 hours.

333
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,746
Our polling shows
that 72% of citizens

334
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:47,982
are in favor of adding
T-dazzle to their water,

335
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:50,701
effectively killing
Councilman Jamm's so-called

336
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,886
Clean Water Bill.

337
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,554
Eat it, Jamm.
I won.

338
00:11:53,605 --> 00:11:55,122
Apology accepted.

339
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:56,473
You know, I've actually
come around

340
00:11:56,491 --> 00:11:57,775
to your way of thinking
on this.

341
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:00,428
My only thought is,
why stop here?

342
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:01,595
Ladies and gentlemen,

343
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:04,515
Sweetums president
Jessica Wicks.

344
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:07,835
Whoo!

345
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:11,405
Look, we all love T-dazzle.

346
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,408
But we can do more to improve
our drinking supply.

347
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,494
Sweetums is excited
to propose an alternative

348
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,880
to boring municipal water.

349
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:22,349
We call it "Drink-ems"!

350
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,434
Whoo!

351
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:25,402
Sweetums is prepared
to take over

352
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,037
the management
of Pawnee's water.

353
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:29,957
This is gonna save this town
beaucoup bucks.

354
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:32,626
Take a sip
of this delicious water

355
00:12:32,677 --> 00:12:35,229
and imagine it coming
out of your faucets at home.

356
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,231
This water is filled
with sugar.

357
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:41,985
There's absolutely no way
we are doing this.

358
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,921
Checkmate.

359
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:45,840
Did you bring those with you
just to do that?

360
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:47,341
- Maybe.
- Damn.

361
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,625
It is a baller move.

362
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,762
What are we gonna do now,
Leslie?

363
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,147
Hey.

364
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:55,332
Okay, are you still mad at me
about the poodle thing?

365
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,417
It was just a dumb game.

366
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:57,785
I can pick another dog.

367
00:12:57,836 --> 00:12:59,536
I'm not mad about the choice.

368
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:01,338
I'm mad about your reasons.

369
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:04,174
"Pretty,"makeup"...
is that all you know about me?

370
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:06,143
We don't hang out that much.

371
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:08,145
It's not like you know
a ton about me.

372
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:10,614
You're beautiful,
yet cold and aloof.

373
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:12,833
You pride yourself
on being a loner.

374
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:15,118
You do not obey,
you choose to cooperate.

375
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:16,837
And when you stop baring
your fangs to pick a mate,

376
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,055
it's for life.

377
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,824
And you're fiercely loyal
to your pack,

378
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:23,777
which makes you
a rare black Siberian husky.

379
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:26,597
That was so spot-on,
it was scary.

380
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,949
I need to go lie down
for 45 minutes.

381
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,169
No, an hour...

382
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:33,838
a full hour.

383
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,289
Good morning.

384
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,841
This won't take long.

385
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,543
Simply put, it would be madness

386
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,428
to let Sweetums take over
our water supply

387
00:13:41,463 --> 00:13:42,579
and pump it full of sugar.

388
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:44,131
What's next...

389
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:45,916
cookie dough toothpaste?

390
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,469
Bad example.
That would be amazing.

391
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,889
My point is, Sweetums is an
evil, profit-hungry corporation

392
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:53,140
that is ruining our health.

393
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:54,975
Ever since Sweetums
opened its doors,

394
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:57,094
obesity is up 100%.

395
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:58,779
It's unacceptable.

396
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:02,266
Down with that poison-peddling
corporate monster.

397
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:04,368
Down with Sweetums!

398
00:14:07,372 --> 00:14:08,455
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,010
Heard about your speech.
Sounded great.

400
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,660
I wish you could've seen it.
It felt so good.

401
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:14,495
I love loose cannon-ing.

402
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:16,947
You know, I love the power
of no consequences.

403
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:19,616
Well, unfortunately,
there has been one consequence.

404
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:23,254
I just got fired from Sweetums.

405
00:14:23,288 --> 00:14:26,090
Because you were embezzling...

406
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,308
I hope.

407
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,688
Hey, Jessica!

408
00:14:31,864 --> 00:14:33,231
Did you do something
to your hair?

409
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:36,217
Because, sister,
you look good enough to eat.

410
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:37,252
Num num num num num.

411
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,003
What do you want, Leslie?

412
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,405
You can't punish Ben
for something I did.

413
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:41,439
It's not fair.

414
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,491
I love him,
and I will do anything

415
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,126
to help him get his job back.

416
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:46,294
What do you want?

417
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:49,064
I want you
to formally apologize

418
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,699
for what
you said about Sweetums.

419
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,051
I want you to say
that we're a moral,

420
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:57,238
upstanding corporation that
you're proud to have in Pawnee.

421
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,157
And when you make your apology,

422
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,460
I want you to wear
a lime-green pantsuit

423
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:04,195
because it will look horrible
on you.

424
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,781
You are such an autumn.

425
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:08,399
Did you need me for something?

426
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,585
Yes, I want to figure out
your spirit dog,

427
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:11,853
and I'm going to do that

428
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,772
by learning everything there is
to know about you.

429
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:16,074
All right. Game on.

430
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:17,876
Okay, what's
your favorite color?

431
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,878
For cars, it's gold.
For shoes, it's red...

432
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:22,080
unless it's the weekend,
then reverse them.

433
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:25,150
- Favorite music?
- 1970s funk and 1770s opera

434
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,535
and Sugar Ray,
post Mark McGrath

435
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,870
after he left
for Entertainment Tonight.

436
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:30,505
- Favorite book?
- Downton Abbey.

437
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,308
- That's not a...
- Downton... Abbey.

438
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:34,275
Okay.

439
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,611
Um, describe
your perfect Sunday.

440
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:37,862
Church,

441
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:38,913
do the Harper's Magazine
Acrostic,

442
00:15:38,948 --> 00:15:40,415
play my oboe in the jacuzzi

443
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:42,133
while the sun sets
over puget sound.

444
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,234
Favorite movies?

445
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:44,509
In order...
Natural Born Killers,

446
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,687
Remains of the Day,

447
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,106
and Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.

448
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:50,075
Excellent.

449
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,710
Thank you very much
for your time.

450
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:54,813
I will have
your answer shortly.

451
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:57,499
No idea.

452
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,868
If a joint is
properly fashioned,

453
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,653
all you need to do
is guide it into place.

454
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,341
"All you need to do
is guide it into place."

455
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:08,393
What I get from that is,
when parenting,

456
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,729
sometimes a subtle hand
is more effective

457
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,364
than a strong one.

458
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:13,865
This is already
so much more helpful

459
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:15,750
than the last book
on parenting I read...

460
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:19,437
Rad Dads by Apolo Anton Ohno
and Shaun White.

461
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:22,157
Nah.

462
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,275
Ron, why did you throw
that wood away?

463
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:25,743
It's unstable.
It's no good.

464
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:27,211
I just don't understand

465
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:29,213
"the throwing away the wood"
metaphor.

466
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:30,681
What's the lesson?

467
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,068
Oh, I know!
It's potty-training.

468
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,686
That trash can is the toilet,
and the wood was the feces.

469
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:37,672
Chris, I'm not teaching you
anything.

470
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,007
We're just building a crib.

471
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,258
No, I know you're not

472
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,843
consciously teaching me
anything.

473
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,328
I'm trying to siphon off

474
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:45,330
some of your calm,
centered wisdom

475
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:46,364
through metaphors.

476
00:16:46,398 --> 00:16:47,365
Metaphors?

477
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:48,800
I hate metaphors.

478
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:50,802
That's why my favorite book is
Moby Dick...

479
00:16:50,836 --> 00:16:52,887
no froufrou symbolism,

480
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:55,973
just a good, simple tale
about a man who hates an animal.

481
00:16:55,991 --> 00:17:00,295
That's enough for today,
I think.

482
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,732
- An organized child is a...
- No.

483
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,402
Okay, I've been
working on this for three hours,

484
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:09,838
and I know your spirit dog.

485
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:12,841
You are a Nova Scotia toller,

486
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,978
because you're
outgoing and adventurous.

487
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:19,831
And you love Canada?

488
00:17:19,865 --> 00:17:22,233
- No, that's not right.
- No, it isn't.

489
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,585
But I appreciate the effort.

490
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,586
We're good.

491
00:17:24,637 --> 00:17:25,970
And don't beat yourself up.

492
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,139
You'll probably never guess
what kind of dog I am.

493
00:17:28,174 --> 00:17:30,455
You're right. I'll never guess
what kind of dog you are,

494
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:31,676
because you're not a dog.

495
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:32,744
You're a cat.

496
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:34,496
You're temperamental.

497
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,832
You're unpredictable, complex,
and hard to read.

498
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:40,635
You make people work
before you let them in.

499
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:43,438
But if they put the time in
and prove that they care,

500
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,123
then you open yourself up
to them.

501
00:17:45,157 --> 00:17:47,108
Right?

502
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:52,363
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

503
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:55,150
Hmm.

504
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:57,185
"So let's all raise a glass,

505
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:59,521
"full of delicious,
sugary drinking water,

506
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:02,173
to Sweetums...
a Pawnee Institution."

507
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:03,908
Leslie, don't do this.

508
00:18:03,943 --> 00:18:06,828
I have to, Ben.
We can't both be out of a job.

509
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:09,030
What will we do...
sleep all day,

510
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:10,698
take cooking classes together,

511
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:13,168
sit on a couch
and watch movies?

512
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:15,820
- God, that sounds horrible.
- There's more at stake here.

513
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:18,122
I mean, you apologize,
it'll be an endorsement

514
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:19,674
- for the Drink-ems plan.
- I know that, but...

515
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:22,343
And everything you said
about Sweetums was right on.

516
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:25,013
I mean, 90%
of the charity work I did

517
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:27,382
was to compensate
for messes they caused.

518
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:29,884
And I don't want to work
for them anymore.

519
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,119
Are you sure?

520
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,938
Yeah, just go up there,
stick to your guns.

521
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:35,273
It's not gonna make
a difference.

522
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:36,357
I can't beat them.

523
00:18:36,392 --> 00:18:38,693
All I have on my side is
facts and science,

524
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:40,812
and people hate
facts and science.

525
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:42,981
Wait.
I have an idea.

526
00:18:43,015 --> 00:18:45,233
Go get Tom.
Run! Get Tom!

527
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:49,517
Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things

528
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:52,806
about Sweetums
and their great new product.

529
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:54,377
But when I looked
at the research,

530
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:57,179
I found some pretty compelling
facts about Drink-ems

531
00:18:57,214 --> 00:18:59,015
that made me change my tune.

532
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:01,968
Each Drink-ems is packed
with 35%

533
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:05,021
of your daily monopotassium
phosphate requirement.

534
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:09,308
MPP is an emulsifier as well
as a plus-7 PH buffer.

535
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,860
Now, I know
what you're thinking...

536
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,028
what about its molar mass?

537
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:15,231
How does 136.086 grab you?

538
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:17,817
What the...

539
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:19,785
I don't know about y'all,

540
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,654
but Drink-ems seems
pretty boring to me,

541
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:24,206
not like H-2-flow.

542
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:25,491
Excuse me.

543
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:27,276
I have several binders
with very important data

544
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:28,577
that I need to get through.

545
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,251
Well, miss, I think
we'd all appreciate it

546
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,164
if you just swallowed
a teaspoon of hush.

547
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:35,051
Think of H-2-flow
as an app for your teeth.

548
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:38,170
The more flow you take in,
the more sparkle points you get.

549
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,505
Get enough sparkle points,

550
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:41,173
and you're on your way
to your first aqua badge!

551
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,591
Collect enough aqua badges,

552
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:47,513
and we'll welcome you
to the H-2-flow Platinum Club.

553
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:50,066
I'm great at business,
and I'm great at parks stuff.

554
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,901
I'm like Picasso meets
Michael Jordan.

555
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,102
I can paint,

556
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,072
but, uh, I can also be
a world-class gambler.

557
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:58,024
Ron, what's this?

558
00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:59,859
The crib I built.

559
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,577
I'm giving it to you and Ann.

560
00:20:01,611 --> 00:20:02,795
It's perfectly safe.

561
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,297
I tested it by hitting it
with my truck.

562
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:06,615
Well, Ron, I can't accept.

563
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:08,317
This is for your baby.

564
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:10,136
There's more than
one crib tree in a forest.

565
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:11,653
That's not a lesson,
by the way,

566
00:20:11,672 --> 00:20:14,290
just a comment
on lumber availability.

567
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:16,825
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

568
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:18,844
Nobody has
all the right answers

569
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,496
in parenting, including me.

570
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:22,298
And that toxic crib you bought

571
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:23,933
won't be the last mistake
you make.

572
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:25,501
But a man who's this worried

573
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:27,303
about making
all the right choices

574
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,938
cares very much.

575
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:30,839
That's all that matters.

576
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:32,942
You'll be a great father.

577
00:20:32,976 --> 00:20:34,276
Thank you, Ron...

578
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:36,112
for the crib and the advice.

579
00:20:36,232 --> 00:20:39,181
It's much better
than any metaphor.

580
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:41,901
Does the white whale
actually symbolize

581
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:44,320
the unknowability
and meaninglessness

582
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:46,238
of human existence?

583
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,074
No.

584
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,459
It's just a [bleep] fish.

585
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:52,378
Hey, good news.

586
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:53,529
Drink-ems is dead.

587
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,764
As of tomorrow,
every Pawnee resident

588
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:58,200
will have H-2-flow
in their drinking water.

589
00:20:58,235 --> 00:20:59,268
That's great news.

590
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:01,404
H-2-flow is fluoride, right?

591
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:03,456
I think so.

592
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,542
I'll double-check with Tom,
but I'm, like, 95% sure.

593
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:07,743
Wow.
Look at us.

594
00:21:07,777 --> 00:21:10,296
Two people, who are about
to have zero jobs.

595
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,380
Weird, huh?

596
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:12,415
And you and I...

597
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:14,383
we always land
on our feet, right?

598
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:15,885
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh!

599
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,671
Guess who won
that plain blue T-shirt?

600
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:19,839
No way!

601
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,956
Look how blue it is.

602
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:22,576
Wow. Things are
already looking up.

603
00:21:22,696 --> 00:21:24,099
Yeah!

604
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:26,139
