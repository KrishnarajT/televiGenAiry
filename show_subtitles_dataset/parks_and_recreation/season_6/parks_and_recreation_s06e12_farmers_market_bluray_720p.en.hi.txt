00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:06,879
I've got to say that this report
is quite impressive, Miss Knope.

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:08,266
Thank you very much,
Mr. City Manager.

3
00:00:08,301 --> 00:00:10,001
And I have to say that the way

4
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:11,036
that you're rockin'
those slacks

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,151
is quite impressive as well.

6
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:13,338
Well, thank you.

7
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:15,807
- Can we hurry this up, please?
- What?

8
00:00:15,842 --> 00:00:17,342
There's nothing wrong
with acknowledging

9
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,644
the fantastic work
of one of your employees,

10
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,480
especially if she's adorable.

11
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,014
I am back
at the parks department,

12
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:24,349
and Ben is city manager,

13
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:25,705
but we're married,
so it's kosher.

14
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:27,686
And awesome.
We live together...

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,920
- And work together.
- And we are so...

16
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,055
In sync...

17
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,156
That we finish each other's...

18
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,025
Sentences!

19
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,960
We rehearsed that at home.

20
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:35,961
Naked in bed.

21
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:37,763
- What!
- What!

22
00:00:37,797 --> 00:00:40,932
Please stamp the form.

23
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,168
I just want to admire it
one more time.

24
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:46,204
Again, fantastic work.

25
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,840
In fact, such good work...

26
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:50,175
I think I'm in love with you.

27
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:51,843
Oh, my God, that's great news,

28
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:52,944
'cause I'm in love
with you too.

29
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:53,945
- What?
- What?

30
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,180
Stamp the form.

31
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:56,982
Okay, let's not let Ron feel
left out.

32
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,016
We love you too, Ron.

33
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,885
- Stamp the damn form.
- Group hug!

34
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,119
Oh, I'm down for a group hug.

35
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,854
- Little G.H.
- Bring it in.

36
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:04,623
Come o...

37
00:01:06,592 --> 00:01:07,893
Wow.

38
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:09,194
I think our love
made him angry.

39
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:10,295
I think he broke my wrist.
I'm not kidding.

40
00:01:10,329 --> 00:01:11,296
Really?

42
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:32,818
Good morning, Ann Perkins.

43
00:01:32,852 --> 00:01:33,852
How are you feeling today?

44
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,220
Perfect.

45
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:37,589
Except that I'm a whale
and that my feet already kill.

46
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:39,191
Whales don't have feet.

47
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,159
I am a crazy shape.

48
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:42,494
This morning
when I got out of bed,

49
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:43,695
I just tipped forward

50
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,630
like a poorly made bowling pin.

51
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:47,599
Did I mention that my feet
kill me all the time?

52
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:48,600
Oh!

53
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:49,601
Let me rub them.

54
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:51,370
Oh, wait. No.

55
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:53,405
I read something
on raddadsolutions.net

56
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,140
that there's a pressure point
in the foot

57
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:56,341
that could induce labor.

58
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,976
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I don't care.

59
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,544
I'm gonna go choke down
those horse pills

60
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,746
I have to take every day.

61
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,447
Oh, no, no, I'll cut them
in half for you.

62
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:04,850
And I will pour you a glass
of flaxseed milk

63
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:05,884
to wash it down.

64
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,419
Everything is amazing.

65
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:09,755
Today is perfect,
and I love you.

66
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,857
Chris is so wonderful

67
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:15,527
and thoughtful and positive.

68
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,195
He's driving me
up the wall.

69
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,597
Smoothie's ready!

70
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,101
Opening this farmers market

71
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:25,737
was one of my greatest
achievements as city councilor.

72
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,072
It's good for the economy,

73
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,540
it's good for families,

74
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,409
and it's good for promoting
a healthy lifestyle,

75
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:32,744
which Pawnee desperately needs.

76
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:34,980
Look at this tiny tree.

77
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:36,548
Can you eat this?

78
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:41,086
Aww. This one's dead.

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,921
Hey, Connie Cabbage.

80
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,389
What's good today?

81
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:46,091
Green cabbage is always
a safe bet.

82
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,092
Red cabbage is good.

83
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:48,126
I mean,

84
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:49,394
you can't go wrong.

85
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:51,329
That's the fun thing
about cabbage.

86
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:52,330
One of the fun things.

87
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,331
Oh!

88
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:58,603
Time to crank this market
up a notch, y'all!

89
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:01,306
"Chardbodies:
Get a chard on"?

90
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:05,010
Let's get "re-charded"
in here!

91
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:06,812
- What the hell is going on?
- Oh, yeah.

92
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,947
That's the new chard stand.

93
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,350
I suppose that's one way
to sell vegetables.

94
00:03:11,384 --> 00:03:13,819
We got Swiss chard,
we got white chard,

95
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:14,987
we got chard poppers!

96
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:17,956
And for all you freaky vegans
out there...

97
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,125
We got chard shots!

98
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,793
Yeah!

99
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,329
Mmm, chard is so bitter.

100
00:03:24,364 --> 00:03:25,997
Ben, do something.

101
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,265
What do you want me to do?

102
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,368
Well, you're the city manager.
Kick them out.

103
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,370
They're violating
every single one

104
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:32,771
of the farmers market's
rules of conduct.

105
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:33,839
By "rules of conduct,"

106
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:36,208
do you mean that wooden sign
you made

107
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:37,642
that says,
"Peas be kind to others"?

108
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:40,279
Yes, and "In case of fire,
romaine calm,"

109
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:43,882
and "You won't bay leaf
how nice olive our vendors are."

110
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,016
I don't like vegetables,

111
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:46,485
but I'm very good
at vegetable puns.

112
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,220
Okay, I admit this is
a little iffy, but...

113
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:50,122
- A little iffy?
- I can't do anything

114
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:52,057
until I check the rules
for city vendors.

115
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:53,458
Cabbage!

116
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,927
Come and... get it.

117
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:57,562
Connie, no.

118
00:03:57,597 --> 00:03:59,498
Put those away.

119
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:01,733
♪ April's sitting on my lap ♪

120
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:04,503

00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,973

00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:10,242
Oh, my God.
You play guitar?

124
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:11,710
No, that's a super small piano.

125
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:13,145
Okay, I'm gonna need
the sarcasm

126
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,980
to take a long walk right now.

127
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,381
My terrible nephew Sebastian

128
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,116
is having his sixth birthday
party this weekend,

129
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,518
and the clown they hired
has shingles.

130
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,719
You think your band could play

131
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:21,720
for an hour?

132
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:23,488
- How much?
- 75.

133
00:04:23,523 --> 00:04:24,823
$75,000?

134
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:26,058
How about 300?

135
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,226
$300,000?

136
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,195
- 150.
- They'll do it.

137
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,749
Ah, thank you.
That is such a relief.

138
00:04:31,764 --> 00:04:33,198
I love my nephew very much,

139
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,333
but he's
a horrible little tyrant,

140
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,335
so don't ruin this day for him!

141
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:38,603
150 bucks?

142
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:40,338
Split that four ways, boom.

143
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:42,774
$600.

144
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:44,676
I'll say it again:
The men's room needs

145
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:46,878
a separate dispenser
for face wash.

146
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,680
I can't wash my face
with hand soap.

147
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,415
Look at these pores.
They're gaping.

148
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,217
- Hey, guys.
- Time-out.

149
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,052
Let's take a brief recess.

150
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,387
Can we help you, Ann?

151
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,689
I was looking for Leslie,
but now I'm curious

152
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:59,484
why you guys are sitting
around doing nothing

153
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:00,959
and getting drunk at work.

154
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:02,661
It's the whine & cheese club,
gorgeous.

155
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,162
It's a monthly gathering

156
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:05,197
where we all get together
and vent

157
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,398
about what annoys us at work.

158
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,001
Over fine wines and cheeses,
of course.

159
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:10,102
Larry, salami!

160
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:12,604
The human resources department

161
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,273
requires that I be available
once a month

162
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:19,011
to discuss workplace disputes
with my employees.

163
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:20,512
The rules do not specify

164
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:21,880
whether or not
I'm allowed to listen

165
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:25,217
to Willie Nelson
on my headphones.

166
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,753
And Kyle parked his car
in my spot again.

167
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,388
Now, that is the fourth time
this month.

I just want to choke him

00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:40,926
- Time.
- This looks like fun.

173
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,367
I want to try.

174
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:43,435
Mm, there's rules to this,
sweet pea.

175
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,436
It's Donna's turn next.

176
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,937
I'll cede my time to Ann.

177
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,539
I have a feeling
this is gonna be good.

178
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:48,740
Okay, well, I'm not gonna talk
for long,

179
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,375
'cause I have to pee again,

180
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,743
'cause I have to pee
every six minutes,

181
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:53,879
'cause I have a beach ball
in my stomach

182
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:54,946
that's punching on my bladder.

183
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,715
That sucks.

184
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:59,117
I know.
And I'm never not hungry.

185
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,219
- Oh, well, have some cheese.
- I can't have cheese, Larry!

186
00:06:01,254 --> 00:06:02,454
And I can't have wine either.

187
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,989
I can't have anything good.

188
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:06,892
You know, what I can have
is liquefied flaxseed.

189
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:08,660
But I don't want that.
You know what I want?

190
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:10,462
Pork rinds.
I want jelly beans.

191
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,298
And I want a huge trash bag
filled with mashed potatoes.

192
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,666
I want to be Pac-Man,

193
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,702
and instead of dots,
I want 'em to be cinnamon buns.

194
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:19,037
I want to be a giant head
and a mouth,

195
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,873
and I just want to eat rows
and rows of junk food pellets,

196
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:24,610
and where's my trash bag
of potatoes?

197
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:29,815
Time.

198
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:30,849
Yikes.

199
00:06:30,883 --> 00:06:33,118
Okay, Harrison Ford
movie night.

200
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:34,953
Before we do that,
I was thinking more

201
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:36,321
about that chard guy.

202
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:37,990
I mean, it would be very easy
for you to revoke

203
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:39,124
their license.

204
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:41,994
Okay, Leslie,
this is city business,

205
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,228
and I'm not an emperor.

206
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,130
I can't just kick them out
for no reason.

207
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:47,032
The reason is
it's vegetable porn.

208
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,333
Porn on the cob.

209
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,768
I'm sorry.
I'm just very good at that.

210
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:51,236
Look, I am not a prude,

211
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:52,504
but the point is,

212
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,872
people shouldn't be half naked,

213
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:55,641
you know, in public,
in the middle of the day,

214
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:56,775
in front of children.

215
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,710
There's your reason.
Kick them out.

216
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:01,513
Look, now that
we're working together again,

217
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,416
maybe it would be good
to keep our home life

218
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,385
and our work life separate.

219
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,453
Like we only talk
about work stuff

220
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:09,721
when we're at city hall,

221
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:12,057
like a firewall system.

222
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,092
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
That's smart.

223
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:15,661
Home is home, and work is work.

224
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:17,496
We can always talk about this
tomorrow at the office.

225
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,464
Good.
Glad you agree.

226
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:20,465
All right.

227
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,801
Crystal Skull it is.

228
00:07:22,835 --> 00:07:25,070
No, it's ridiculous
to think that you could survive

229
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:27,706
a nuclear blast
by jumping into a refrigerator.

230
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,074
- Mm-hmm, yeah, uh-huh.
- But still, it's like...

231
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:31,009
Okay, so I found
a legal precedent

232
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,978
to shut down
those vegetable smut peddlers.

233
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,413
What is happening?

234
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:35,480
Firewall, man.

235
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:36,915
We pulled into the parking lot,

236
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,984
and this is technically
city hall property,

237
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:40,652
so now we're at work...
let's do this.

238
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:42,988
The farmers market is
a community meeting place,

239
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,523
and that pan-sexual
stripper show

240
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:46,158
basically negates
the whole purpose.

241
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:47,893
So if you're looking
for a reason to kick them out,

242
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,561
here's 158.

243
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,463
The new farmers market
rule book.

244
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:53,265
Okay, when did you make this?

245
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:54,499
I stayed up all night.

246
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:56,401
I also made these...

247
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:58,403
Leslie's toffee surprise.

248
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:01,073
The surprise is there's toffee
in the inside.

249
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:02,774
You can eat those
once you revoke

250
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:04,676
the chard vendor's license.

251
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,578
Good day, colleague.

252
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,413
Okay.

253
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,019
Ann Perkins!
How are you feeling?

254
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:14,054
You don't want to know.

255
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,822
It's all I want to know.

256
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:17,724
All right, man,
you asked for it.

257
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,025
I have shooting pains
that go all the way up

258
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,393
from my butt to my neck.

259
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:21,895
My stomach has
so many stretch marks on it

260
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,397
that it looks like
an old-fashioned globe.

261
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:24,898
My boobs are getting
really sore.

262
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:26,299
Also, I just read
Brooke Shields' book

263
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,534
on post-partum depression.

264
00:08:27,568 --> 00:08:31,171
Now I have pre-post-partum
depression anxiety.

265
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:32,572
Well, never fear.

266
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,207
I will get you Tylenol
for your pain

267
00:08:34,242 --> 00:08:35,675
and shea butter for your belly.

268
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,910
And your voluptuous figure

269
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,345
only means your body is working

270
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,547
exactly as nature intended it.

271
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,616
There, it's all good.
Is that better?

272
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,750
Yeah. Thanks.

273
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:45,106
I've been reading up
on nipples.

274
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,853
The reason that you're feeling
nipple sensitivity

275
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:48,455
is because your milk ducts
in your nipples

276
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:49,589
are opening up,

277
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:52,058
which is why I bought you
this nipple kit.

278
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:53,393
It's from Kernsten's...
the nipple people.

279
00:08:53,428 --> 00:08:55,562
It has nipple cream,
nipple pads,

280
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,497
and also a special
nipple pimple ointment

281
00:08:57,532 --> 00:08:59,533
in case you develop
any pimples on your nipples.

282
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:02,769
Oh, my God, you have to stop
using the word "nipple."

283
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:04,037
Okay. Anyway.

284
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:05,772
Hopefully that will help you
with any sensitivity

285
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:09,376
that may arise around your...

286
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,144
boob hats.

287
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:12,546
Larry, get in there!
Come on!

288
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,980
What do... I don't even know
what we're doing.

289
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:15,715
What is the meaning
of this, nurse?

290
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,250
Emergency whine & cheese club.

291
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:18,452
Put your headphones on, Ron.

292
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:19,486
I have a lot of complaints.

293
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,488
Sit down.
I need to vent.

294
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,824
And do not
under any circumstances

295
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:24,825
respond to anything I say.

296
00:09:24,859 --> 00:09:25,959
All right.

297
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:27,961
Let's talk about vomit, kids.

298
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,796
I do it all day long.

299
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,631
♪ Super fun

300
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,366
♪ it feels super good

301
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:36,670
♪ I wanna do it all the time

302
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:40,340
♪ sex is cool

303
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,609
Okay, Sex Is Cool.
Got that.

304
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:45,412
I say we finish
on Drunk Off Our Asses.

305
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,914
And I think we should do
Sex in Space.

306
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:49,816
It's 20 minutes long,
but it's really good.

307
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:52,052
Babe, I don't think you should
play any of those songs

308
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:53,253
for a group of six-year-olds.

309
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:55,155
Whoa, wait...
six-year-olds?

310
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:56,957
Did you book us a gig
at a kids' party?

311
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,692
You said we were playing
at a festival.

312
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:00,093
You said Dave Grohl
might be there.

313
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:02,596
Dave Grohl might be there.
I don't know.

314
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,897
He might be anywhere.

315
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:05,665
The guy's awesome,
and he's unpredictable.

316
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,901
No, no, I'm not playing
for a bunch of screaming kids.

317
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:10,036
Mouse Rat is a rock band.
We're not the Wiggles.

318
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:11,238
Come on!

319
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:13,206
I'm sick of all the drama
with this band.

320
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:14,341
I-I quit.

321
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,709
I'm going
back to rabbinical school.

322
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:17,844
Umbilical school?

323
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,945
Rivers, come back.

324
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,647
Rivers, don't do this.
Hey!

325
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:23,016
Shaq might be there!

326
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,317
Hey, did you get a chance

327
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:26,153
to sign off
on that booklet I gave you?

328
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:28,355
Well, I read it,
but it seems like

329
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:29,890
your farmers market rules

330
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:32,292
may be specifically targeting
chardbodies.

331
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:34,461
What? How?

332
00:10:34,495 --> 00:10:36,196
"No visible cleavage.

333
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,631
"No strobe lights.

334
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:39,332
No chard-related innuendo."

335
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:40,967
Those apply to all vendors.

336
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:42,068
Either way, it's too late.

337
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:43,904
The train has left the station.

338
00:10:43,938 --> 00:10:45,705
Okay, what train,
from which station?

339
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,073
- You're revoking my license?
- Oh, boy.

340
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:49,075
Yes, Nolan, under the auspices

341
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,377
of the office of city manager,

342
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:51,711
et cetera, et cetera,
it's not important,

343
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:53,714
you are in violation
of many rules,

344
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,382
and therefore you cannot sell
your goods anymore

345
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,516
at the Pawnee farmers market.

346
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:59,186
Ben, back me up on this
without hesitation.

347
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,987
Nolan, can I have a second
to speak with my w...

348
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:03,090
with Ms. Knope
for a second?

349
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:04,491
Look, chard is disgusting.

350
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,259
You try selling it
without sexy dancers.

351
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:07,360
It's impossible.

352
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:08,795
It's like,
"Hey, you like lettuce?

353
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,097
"Try this. It's worse.

354
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:11,998
It tastes like kale
took a dump on spinach."

355
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,609
I like to think of it
as celery with B.O.

356
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:14,901
But if it's so gross,

357
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:16,169
you should just sell
something else.

358
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:17,404
I inherited this farm
from my dad.

359
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:18,505
It's all I have.

360
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:19,573
Plus, the other vendors
want me there.

361
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:20,707
I'm good for business.

362
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:22,342
We're not revoking
your license.

363
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:23,477
For now.

364
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:25,645
I am sorry you had to come in.

365
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,847
Judas!

366
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:28,949
I don't appreciate
being ambushed, Leslie.

367
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,517
- Let's just go home.
- No.

368
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:31,618
I know what
you're trying to do.

369
00:11:31,652 --> 00:11:32,919
If we go home,
the firewall is up,

370
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,121
and then you don't have to deal
with me anymore.

371
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:36,022
Instead, fellow employee,

372
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:38,158
I will meet you
in the basement conference room

373
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:39,459
at 6:00 P.M.,

374
00:11:39,494 --> 00:11:41,328
and we will solve
this chard issue

375
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:42,429
once and for all.

376
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,097
Don't forget your approval pen.

377
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:45,365
What?
There's no such thing.

378
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,700
Yes, there is.

379
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:49,536
I made it for you last night.

380
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,805
Ugh, and Lamaze class,

381
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,440
wait till I tell you
about that Ponzi scheme.

382
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:54,875
Ugh.

383
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:56,543
Oh, hey, Donna, what the hell?

384
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:59,312
You know I can't be
around smoke or fatty tuna.

385
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:00,347
Ron...

386
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:01,581
At first, this was funny,

387
00:12:01,616 --> 00:12:02,582
but it's gotten out of hand.

388
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:03,884
This was our chance

389
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:06,553
to vent about work,
and you've taken it over.

390
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:07,654
Yeah!

391
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:09,256
It's sushi and cigar club now.

392
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,824
Wow. Okay.

393
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:13,427
I see how it is.

394
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:14,761
I feel bad.

395
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:16,329
I don't.
This is a Cuban.

396
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:17,998
This is yellowtail.
I feel amazing.

397
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:20,167
Whoa!
Monster in the window!

398
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:21,601
You know what
my biggest complaint is?

399
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:23,770
I have a million things
I need to complain about,

400
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:25,072
and I can't take them home
because Chris is

401
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:26,606
the most considerate person
in the world,

402
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:27,762
and he just wants to help me,

403
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,015
and then I feel bad about that,

404
00:12:29,043 --> 00:12:30,811
and then I get annoyed
that he wants to help me,

405
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:32,012
and I feel even worse
about that!

406
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,346
I thought you guys
would be cool

407
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:34,681
with me complaining
'cause it's all you do,

408
00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:37,584
is sit here and complain
without judgment or guilt.

409
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:39,138
But you know what?
I guess I was wrong.

410
00:12:39,153 --> 00:12:40,520
And you know what?
I would yell some more,

411
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:43,690
but I think I just peed
my pants a little bit.

412
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:45,025
What's happening now?

413
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,460
Is the nurse upset?

414
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:48,462
I don't care.

415
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,564
Okay, 6:00.
Let's do this.

416
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:51,631
Larry?

417
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,033
Mm. Hey, Leslie.

418
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,067
Ben couldn't make it,

419
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:55,802
so he asked me
to read you this.

420
00:12:55,837 --> 00:12:57,471
"Dear honey..."
Oh, how sweet.

421
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:59,272
- Read.
- Oh.

422
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:01,187
"Sorry, but I think we just need
to take a break

423
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:02,309
"from this work issue.

424
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:03,577
"Please don't grind your teeth
too hard

425
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:05,045
"when you hear this.
I will see you in the car.

426
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:06,046
I love you."

427
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,147
Oh, that is so sweet

428
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,615
that you still write
love letters to...

429
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:13,386
What the hell
are you doing out here?

430
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:15,889
Sorry, babe.
I am off city hall property.

431
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:17,357
You have to stop.

432
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:18,358
Firewall.

433
00:13:18,393 --> 00:13:19,359
Wrong.

434
00:13:19,394 --> 00:13:20,427
All roads and bridges

435
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:21,728
fall under the purview

436
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:23,029
of the Pawnee department
of transportation,

437
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:25,332
which is located on
the fourth floor of city hall.

438
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,967
Firewall down.

439
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,169
Stay frosty, Wyatt.

440
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:30,470
We're just getting started.

441
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:32,638
Okay, well, that's interesting.

442
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:33,588
You know why?

443
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,243
- Why?
- Because...

444
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:37,744
Mother...

445
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:41,784
Ha-ha!

446
00:13:41,818 --> 00:13:43,586
Bank! Private property.

447
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,121
Firewall restored!

448
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,188
Ha-ha-ha!

449
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:47,389
The concrete
that you're standing on

450
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:50,559
was poured by a municipal
construction crew.

451
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:54,797
Private fountain,

452
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:55,798
private property.

453
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:56,799
I'm safe.

454
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,501
Guess where the water
comes from.

455
00:13:58,535 --> 00:14:02,204
The Pawnee reservoir.

456
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,807
You can't escape
city hall, fool!

457
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:08,310
Let's dance.

458
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:10,646
Hey, friends.

459
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,947
I'm just about to go
on my night jog.

460
00:14:11,982 --> 00:14:13,048
Would you like to join me?

461
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,450
Mm, hard pass.

462
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:16,652
We're here because you need
to tend to your woman.

463
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:18,087
She's complaining
about everything,

464
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:19,588
ruining whine & cheese club.

465
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:21,290
I literally have
1,000 questions.

466
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:23,058
Why is Ron wearing headphones?

467
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:24,174
What's whine & cheese club?

468
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:25,461
And what is Ann
complaining about?

469
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,096
You, mostly...
how you never let her vent

470
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,430
because you're always too busy

471
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:29,826
trying to solve
everything for her.

472
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,400
She's upset that I'm trying
to help her?

473
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:34,170
You've fallen into a classic
trap, Christopher...

474
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:36,272
trying to fix
a woman's problems

475
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,274
instead of just listening
to what they are!

476
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:39,508
Why are you yelling?

477
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:42,445
Tom put all my records
into this rectangle!

478
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,280
Hey, man, if Ann needs Tylenol,

479
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:45,414
she can get it herself.

480
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:46,816
What she needs from you

481
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,417
is to just look her
in the eyes,

482
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,053
nod your head, and say
those two magic words.

483
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,255
"That sucks."

484
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,690
"That sucks"?

485
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:55,958
I spent my entire life

486
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:57,426
reading instructional books
about relationships

487
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,295
in order to trick women
into liking me.

488
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,796
When Ann tells you
what's bothering her,

489
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:02,031
don't try to fix it.

490
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,599
Just say,

491
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,868
"Damn, that sucks."

492
00:15:05,902 --> 00:15:07,336
The songs just play

493
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,938
one right after the other!

494
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:11,841
This is an excellent rectangle!

495
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:16,946
Okay, this is insane.

496
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,447
It is 40 degrees,

497
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,049
and we are standing
in freezing water.

498
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,350
No, this is our motivation.

499
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:22,885
We are not leaving
this fountain

500
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,820
until we've figured this out
once and for all.

501
00:15:24,855 --> 00:15:26,575
Fine. Why are you
not supporting me on this?

502
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,890
I thought you agreed with me.

503
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:29,992
I do, as a person,

504
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:31,494
but as city manager,

505
00:15:31,528 --> 00:15:33,796
I'm not 100% sure
you have a case.

506
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,731
You're not listening
to my side.

507
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:36,832
I mean, sometimes when we
disagree,

508
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,267
you're so passionate,

509
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,136
I feel like I'm arguing
with the sun.

510
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,537
What? That is totally crazy!

511
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:45,407
I am super chill all the time!

512
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:48,077
Look, let's just admit it.
We're in a weird position.

513
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,879
We're married.

514
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:51,480
Our professional status has
flipped, like, five times.

515
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,482
I mean, now I'm your boss.

516
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:56,152
This is "un-charded" territory
for us.

517
00:15:56,186 --> 00:15:58,354
Oh, that's nice.

518
00:15:58,388 --> 00:16:00,589
Thanks.
I learned from the best.

519
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:01,657
The point is,

520
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:03,359
forget firewalls.

521
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:06,762
Let's just be respectful
and communicate,

522
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,531
and we'll find
the right balance.

523
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,065
You're right.

524
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,101
I should have considered
your side.

525
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,536
I love you,

526
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:16,572
and you're also
a very smart person.

527
00:16:18,942 --> 00:16:20,342
Let's get out of this fountain.

528
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:21,777
I can't because my legs
are numb.

529
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,345
Yeah, I can't move.
Are we gonna die here?

530
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,513
Yeah.

531
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,549
No, don't do that.

532
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,616
I don't like this game.

533
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:28,717
I don't know
what the rules are!

534
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:30,186
Okay, babe, here's what I did.

535
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,954
Tell me if this is appropriate
for a kids' song.

536
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:34,890
I changed the lyrics
in Sex Hair to...

537
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:37,092
♪ You got sex bears

538
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,195
♪ you got 'em from me, kids

539
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:40,563
♪ sex bears

540
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:41,564
♪ big ol' sex bears

541
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:43,232
Andy, the word "hair"

542
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:45,701
was not the problem
with Sex Hair.

543
00:16:45,736 --> 00:16:48,370
Oh, it's sex!
Oh, crap.

544
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:49,605
Now what the hell
am I supposed to sing?

545
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,173
It's time, Andrew.

546
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,441
These kids are tearing
my house apart,

547
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:53,909
and I need you to calm them
with the power of song.

548
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:54,977
Oh, gosh,
here's the thing...

549
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,145
I can't do it.

550
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:57,279
I got laryngitis.

551
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:59,782
You will not bail on me,
Andrew Dwyer.

552
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,117
You will perform.

553
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,585
My nephew is something
of an outcast in his school,

554
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:04,387
and I got Erica Swarvane
to come,

555
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:05,454
which is a huge get.

556
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:06,722
She rules the first grade.

557
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:08,157
And this party will determine
his social status

558
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:09,992
for the next hundred years!

559
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:12,228
So you better get out there,
or I am going to lose it!

560
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,562
Have you not lost it?

561
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,030
Oh, you don't even know!

562
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,899
Babe, I'm freaking out.

563
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,033
Listen to me.

564
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,769
You make up songs all the time

565
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:20,803
off the top of your head.

566
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:22,138
You do.

567
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,806
You can do this,
and afterwards,

568
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,241
we can have cake.

569
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:27,276
I already had cake.

570
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,778
Andy!

571
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,914
Okay, focus up,
you little monsters!

572
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:33,582
Not you, Erica.
You're an angel,

573
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:34,817
and we're thrilled you're here.

574
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,619
Now, is everyone ready to hear

575
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:38,120
the best music
you've ever heard

576
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:39,989
in your miserable little lives?

577
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,457
No!

578
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:43,793
Okay, then,

Oh, hey.
How was your day?

It was okay.

617
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,043
Now my legs really hurt.

618
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:25,344

but in my calves.

A new surprise every day.

That sucks.

622
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:32,818
I know.

623

Thanks.

00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:51,036
I'm sorry that I was trying

00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,505
Oh, God, don't apologize.

- Oh.
- Excuse me.

638
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:08,754
- Mr. Karate?
- Mr. Karate!

639
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:10,723
My son wants you to sing
at his birthday party

640
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:12,591
next weekend.

641
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,959
- Are you available?
- He is,

642
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,562
but it's actually $250
for short notice.

643
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:17,730
You can call this number

644
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:19,865
and ask for April Karate.

645
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,033
Yes, I will.

646
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,601
- Babe...
- Oh, my God.

647
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:23,936
That was amazing.

648
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,372
I kind of think you can make
a career out of this.

649
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,407
But, I mean, I don't know.

650
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,642
W-what does that make me...
a kids' performer?

651
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:32,211
I'm supposed to be a rock star.

652
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:34,113
You just had fun in there
and made $150.

653
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:36,482
Who cares about what you were
supposed to be?

654
00:20:36,516 --> 00:20:37,816
- Yeah.
- Plus, you have never been

655
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:39,184
sexier to me
than when you were singing

656
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:40,285
to those kids just now.

657
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,286
- Really?
- Yeah.

658
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:43,088
Well, that's weird.

659
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:45,424
Nolan, I'm very sorry

660
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,226
that I overreacted
and overstepped my bounds.

661
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,327
I understand.

662
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:49,428
When I got into the chard game,

663
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:51,397
I knew I'd ruffle
some feathers.

664
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:53,265
Sure. I'm just glad
that we could all come

665
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:54,466
to an agreement.

666
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:57,169
All right, everybody,
it is now 5:00 P.M.,

667
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:59,071
which means the farmers market
is closed.

668
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:01,173
And farmers market after dark

669
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:03,809
is open for business!

670
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,648
Well, if this is the way

671
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,362
people want to buy
their produce, so be it.

672
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:14,086
This town is full of lunatics.

673
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:19,124
Ugh!

674
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:20,679
Oh, my God,
this was a terrible idea.

675
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:23,629
Yeah, it's like a tree
barfed in my mouth.

676
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:25,338
Bleh.
