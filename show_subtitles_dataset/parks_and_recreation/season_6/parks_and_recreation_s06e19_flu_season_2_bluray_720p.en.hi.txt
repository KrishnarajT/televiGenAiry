1
00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:02,114
Don't touch anything.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,009
People are dropping like flies.

3
00:00:04,044 --> 00:00:05,844
We already had to quarantine
Larry.

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,179
Leslie, I don't feel good.

5
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:08,514
Can't I just work from home?

6
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:09,915
The tent is your home now,
Larry.

7
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,216
We already forwarded your mail.

8
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:13,619
Oh, well, here's something

9
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:15,554
that's gonna make you feel
really good.

10
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:16,755
Guess who I just secured

11
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,690
as the headliner
for the unity concert.

12
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:19,691
Chipp McCapp.

13
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:20,693
- No!
- Yes!

14
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:21,860
Nice!

15
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,028
Wait, no.
I don't want to touch your hand.

16
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:24,329
Chipp McCapp
is the most amazing

17
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:26,265
17-year-old country singer
in the entire world.

18
00:00:26,299 --> 00:00:27,299
He's, like,
Indiana's sweetheart.

19
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:28,400
We are huge "Chipp Monks."

20
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:29,935
That's what his fans
call themselves.

21
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:31,270
I don't know why.
"Chipmunks."

22
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:33,072
Because of the animal?
No, that's too simple.

23
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:34,406
Yeah, okay, his latest song,

24
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,241
beautiful like my mom
,

25
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,277
has, like,
2 million hits on YouTube.

26
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:42,281
♪ Well, she don't care
about no fancy trends ♪

27
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:45,617
♪ she's just a mom
from old south bend ♪

28
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:47,019
Get home safe, boys.

29
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,254
And thank you
for protecting our freedom.

30
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:53,926
- Let's play it again.
- Play it again.

00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:16,949
Today at a local vineyard,
a bunch of sommeliers...

33
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,784
aka, wine experts...

34
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:20,652
are going to be competing
for their certification.

35
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:22,087
I'm gonna hire the best one

36
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:24,089
- at my new restaurant...
- Tom's Bistro.

37
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:26,425
People that convince other
people to buy expensive stuff

38
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,661
they don't need...
those are the real heroes.

39
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:31,063
Donna, April,

40
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:32,798
wine country train
is leaving the station.

41
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:34,133
- You ready?
- I want to come.

42
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:36,068
I love wine
and everything about it...

43
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,369
the soil, the vines.

44
00:01:37,404 --> 00:01:39,705
I studied Botany for three years
at Purdue University.

45
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,040
Go, boilermakers!

46
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:44,043
There will be alcohol there,
so I will go as well.

47
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:45,377
Well, maybe I'll tag along.

48
00:01:45,412 --> 00:01:46,612
I don't have any more work
to do.

49
00:01:46,646 --> 00:01:47,646
Maybe it'll be relaxing.

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,014
I didn't invite any of you.

51
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,215
I started with two cool people;

52
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,650
I ended up
with a bunch of grandpas.

53
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:52,985
Listen, grandpas,

54
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,186
when we get to the vineyard,

55
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,688
there's gonna be
a lot of fancy people there.

56
00:01:56,723 --> 00:01:59,491
Please, I beg you...
don't embarrass me.

57
00:01:59,526 --> 00:02:00,759
How would we embarrass you?

58
00:02:00,794 --> 00:02:01,927
You're already doing it.

59
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:03,295
I begged you.

60
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,630
I guess now that we got

61
00:02:04,664 --> 00:02:05,964
Chipp McCapp as our headliner,

62
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,633
I can get rid
of my awesome wish list.

63
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,201
Yeah, those are long shots.

64
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:10,336
"Bob Dylan's friends"?

65
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,410
Well, I just thought maybe

66
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:12,718
they could get Bob Dylan
to come.

67
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,273
Land Ho.
God, I love them.

68
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:15,708
Everybody does.

69
00:02:15,742 --> 00:02:16,875
But there's no way
they're getting back together.

70
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,410
Their lead singer split
ten years ago.

71
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:20,879
He titled their last album
We'll Never Reunite.

72
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:22,381
Leslie...

73
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:24,049
No!
Back in your tent, sicky!

74
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,820
I'm sorry, but Chipp McCapp's
manager called.

75
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:29,521
He has to drop out.

76
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:30,522
No!

77
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:31,757
Okay,
we need all hands on deck.

78
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:32,925
But there are no hands
to be on deck,

79
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,093
because everybody's
at the winery.

80
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:35,427
Okay, Andy, you and I
need to handle this.

81
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:38,764
We need to be operating
at maximum capa...

82
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:43,569
Oh, no.

83
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:46,572
Damn it, Larry!

84
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:48,007
Sorry.

85
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,810
Xander, my man-der.

86
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:52,845
Tom Haverford,

87
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,514
owner, operator,
and global ambassador

88
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:56,582
for Tom's Bistro,

89
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:58,384
opening this spring in Pawnee.

90
00:02:58,418 --> 00:02:59,418
It's a pleasure to meet you.

91
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,419
Damn.

92
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:01,987
Look at that tie dimple.

93
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:03,155
Respect.

94
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,824
My main target
for Tom's Bistro:

95
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:07,326
Xander Truffant.

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,161
He's the best young somm
in the game.

97
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:10,496
I don't say this lightly...

98
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,997
he's basically the Bruno Mars

99
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,099
of Indiana
amateur wine tasting.

100
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:15,601
If you'll excuse me,

101
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:17,937
I must prepare
for the tasting competition.

102
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:20,272
I pour saline water
through my nose

103
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,374
to clear the mucous
from my smell-centers.

104
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,710
That is
the most beautiful thing

105
00:03:24,744 --> 00:03:26,278
I've ever heard.

106
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:27,446
Aw, man.

107
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,615
It costs $200 to get certified.

108
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:32,951
I wanted to make fun of
stupid people while I get drunk,

109
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:34,853
my two true passions.

110
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:36,021
You want to futz
with these fools?

111
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:37,156
I will bankroll you.

112
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,157
Really?

113
00:03:38,191 --> 00:03:39,158
Oh, hell yeah, pimp.

114
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:40,159
Sounds like fun.

115
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:41,360
Thank you.

116
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:43,295
April Ludgate,
professional drinker.

117
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,865
Where did you study,
Ms. Ludgate?

118
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,200
The Wine...

119
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:49,768
Academy.

120
00:03:49,803 --> 00:03:51,370
The Wine Academy?

121
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:52,371
In Bordeaux?

122
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:53,472
Yes.

123
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,641
Carol,
make sure she's in group "A."

124
00:03:55,675 --> 00:03:57,643
Oh, excuse me.
I want in too.

125
00:03:57,677 --> 00:03:58,837
I know I don't look the part,

126
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:00,145
but I know everything
about wine,

127
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,313
and I will prove it.

128
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:02,548
My name is Craig Middlebrooks,

129
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,550
and this
is my debit rewards card.

130
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:08,120
Well, why wouldn't you
run this by me first, dad?

131
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,289
Whatever.

132
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:12,958
Sorry.
Just weird family business.

133
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:13,959
Sounds private.

134
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:15,261
No need to discuss it with me.

135
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:17,215
My parents had this
small little vacation house

136
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,698
on Lake Hubbard,
and now they've sold it

137
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,933
without telling the rest of us.

138
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:22,067
Did you not hear me say

139
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:23,736
there was no need
to discuss it with me?

140
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,450
My dad sent me this check
out of the blue...

141
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:26,772
my share of the profits.

142
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:30,242
It's so disrespectful
to the family structure.

143
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:31,577
Maybe a drink will help.

144
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:33,078
Put some alcohol in your mouth

145
00:04:33,113 --> 00:04:35,180
to block the words
from coming out.

146
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,515
Some of our blueberry wine?

147
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:37,783
We make it right here
at the vineyard.

148
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:38,917
I don't drink alcohol

149
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,853
from that portion
of the color spectrum.

150
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,521
Hey!
Whew!

151
00:04:42,555 --> 00:04:44,523
Whoa.
That's strong.

152
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:47,026
Holy hell.
That's a lot of alcohol.

153
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,663
We will take four bottles,
please and thank you.

154
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:54,166
All we need to do
is go to Indianapolis,

155
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,502
convince Chipp
to do the festival,

156
00:04:56,536 --> 00:04:59,271
and then, you know, head home.

157
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,107
Are you sure you're feeling
up for this, boss?

158
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:02,308
I'm fine.

159
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:03,876
I've had the flu before,
and I worked through it.

160
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,377
Okay, well, if you do collapse,

161
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:06,712
luckily I know first aid.

162
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:07,780
Or karate.

163
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:08,781
That's not first aid.

164
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:10,783
It is if you do it right.

165
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:11,984
Heimlich!

166
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:13,786
Well, I guess
while you get your medicine,

167
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,220
I'll just stroll
through the candy aisles

168
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:16,221
but won't get any.

169
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:17,256
You can buy two candies.

170
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,691
Two!

171
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:19,692
Can I help you?

172
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:20,859
I have the flu.

173
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:22,361
Super nauseated for a few days,

174
00:05:22,395 --> 00:05:23,395
a lot of barfing.

175
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,897
It's a total disaster.

176
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:26,131
Plus I have
a ton of work to do,

177
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,399
so I need the good stuff,

178
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:31,203
the "Mariah needs
to sing tonight" stuff.

179
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:35,040
You don't look flushed,
no signs of fever.

180
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:36,508
That doesn't seem like the flu.

181
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:37,843
It's the flu.

182
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:41,046
I mean, I don't think
it could be anything...

183
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,886
This counts as one.

184
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,567
So mad at my parents.

185
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,069
I mean, they both wanted
the house

186
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,238
for Columbus Day weekend,
and they fought so much

187
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,739
that they decided
to just sell it

188
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,740
to spite each other...

189
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:00,909
More wine, less talking.

190
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,911
You know,
you are a wonderful guy,

191
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,746
and I admire many things
about you,

192
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,248
but you're a terrible person

193
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,450
to discuss personal problems
with.

194
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:09,618
Thank you, friend.

195
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:12,220
That really means a lot to me.

196
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,224
Pumpkin,
undertones of lavender.

197
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,392
Medium-plus body.

198
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:18,560
It's mostly pumpkin.

199
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:19,828
There's so much pumpkin,

200
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:21,997
it's like a Charlie Brown
Halloween special.

201
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:25,300
I'm getting notes
of dried robin's blood,

202
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,802
old dirty cashews,

203
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,871
and just a hint
of a robot's bathwater.

204
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,374
An old-world wine,
Italian.

205
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:33,375
Ah.

206
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,710
It's a Verdicchio Doc classico,

207
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:35,977
2010.

208
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,145
It's new world,

209
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,980
Northern California,
Napa Valley,

210
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:40,816
someplace beautiful and warm
and amazing

211
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,150
where everyone
is in great shape

212
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,553
and the night sky
is full of stars!

213
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:48,023
This comes from...
your mother's butt.

214
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:49,357
♪ Enlist in Vietnam ♪

215
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:50,859
♪ ain't no woman in the world ♪

216
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:54,029
♪ as beautiful like my mom ♪

217
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,530
♪ America ♪

218
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,967
Man, you were in the bathroom
forever.

219
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,802
The receptionist said that

220
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,803
Chipp will be out
in just a second.

221
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,971
Uh, I just need a minute.

222
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,507
I'm going to call Ben
about nothing.

223
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,176
My parents make me so mad
sometimes.

224
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,012
Just like the time
they couldn't decide

225
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:13,248
who gets the dog,
so they just dropped it off

226
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:14,416
at a local synagogue.

227
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,319
I was like, "Wh... wh... say what?"

228
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,721
Hold on, Ron.

229
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:21,256
Hold that thought,
just for a sec.

230
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:23,558
Hey, honey.

231
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:25,560
Hey.
It's your me.

232
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:26,728
It's wife.

233
00:07:26,763 --> 00:07:29,231
It's Leslie, uh, Knope.

234
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:30,899
I have very big news for you.

235
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,235
Oh, my teeth are blue.

236
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,803
- Blueberries are alcohol...
- What?

237
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:36,238
Are you having a stroke?

238
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:38,673
And I was just saying to Ron
that my dog's Jewish.

239
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,674
Oh.

240
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:40,675
Phone water.

241
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,843
Ben?

242
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,011
Hello?

243
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,346
Hello?

244
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,514
Hi.

245
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,515
Leslie?

246
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,516
It's dead.

247
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,351
Hello?

248
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,587
You know, Leslie sounded weird.

249
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:53,782
I don't want to wait for Tom.

250
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,056
I want to walk home.

251
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:56,224
I'll join you.

252
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:58,060
I'm always game
for a brisk walk.

253
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:01,096
Also, if I leave you alone,
I'm pretty sure you'll die.

254
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,364
Home is that way.

255
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,309
Watch out for that fence.

256
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:16,478
Ah, Mr. Haverford,

257
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:19,648
allow me to introduce
Terrence Montreaux.

258
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:21,149
He is a restaurateur
like yourself.

259
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:22,384
You own a restaurant too?

260
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,885
No, monsieur.

261
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,387
I own 12.

262
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,222
I am here to find
the best sommeliers

263
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,890
as soon as they are...

264
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,393
how you say, um,
"certified."

265
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,394
That was my idea.

266
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,229
That is everyone's idea.

267
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,265
That is why we have this,
how you say...

268
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,467
"thing."

269
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,634
Okay, don't act like
you don't know

270
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,336
the word "thing."

271
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,672
With a filet mignon,
I'd recommend a red...

272
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,441
something bold and dry,
like David Sedaris.

273
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:49,244
Perhaps you could recommend
a Riesling instead.

274
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,246
Not if you're eating steak,
you loon!

275
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,016
You know in the movies,
when the cops show up

276
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,684
and find lipstick
on a wine glass

277
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:57,853
next to a dead body?

278
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,454
This is that wine.

279
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:01,289
♪ I'll bring the girls ♪

280
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:03,625
♪ you bring the beer ♪

281
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,460
♪ and the troops will bring
the freedom ♪

282
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:07,629
We're sorry to interrupt,
Chipp, hi.

283
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:10,132
We just wanted to say
we are such big fans.

284
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,300
It's an honor to meet you.

285
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:12,634
Yeah, well, I'm very blessed.

286
00:09:12,668 --> 00:09:14,302
It's always nice
to meet my amazing fans

287
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:15,470
that keep me going.

288
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:17,139
You're the real superstars.

289
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,407
Thank you.

290
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,575
Would somebody get me
one of those lunch stacks?

291
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,277
And stack 'em for me this time.

292
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,112
Cheese on top
or no one gets paid.

293
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,447
You got it, Chipp.

294
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,448
That's my dad.

295
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,450
The guy's such an idiot.

296
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,951
We wanted to talk to you

297
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,754
about the unity concert,
in Pawnee.

298
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,089
Can you do it?

299
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,757
Yeah... uh, no.

300
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,192
Sorry.
I got a previous engagement.

301
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:38,193
It's a bummer.

302
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,961
Oh.

303
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,463
- Here you go, Chipp.
- Look at that.

304
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,631
The cheese is on top...

305
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,466
of turkey, you dick.

306
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,667
I want ham.

307
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:47,903
I'm sorry, son.
They were out of ham.

308
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:49,237
All right, well,
maybe I should just let mom

309
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:50,906
be manager, then.

310
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,574
Pick 'em up, skip.

311
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,910
Ew.
This guy's the worst.

312
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:57,079
I mean, it sucks
that they didn't have ham,

313
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,914
but you can't treat your dad
like that.

314
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,582
I know, he's a monster.

315
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:01,917
But we need him.

316
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,251
Your job's not that hard, okay?

317
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:04,920
Just anticipate my needs.

318
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:06,521
Anticipatin', Chipp.

319
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:11,693
Of the 25 entrants today,
only 1 has deemed himself

320
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:14,229
worthy of
a sommelier certificate.

321
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:15,898
Oh, my God.
Are you sure?

322
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:16,898
No way.

323
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,066
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

324
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:19,901
Thank you so much, everyone.

325
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:23,071
I think we can agree
that all wine tastes the same,

326
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:26,074
and if you spend
more than $5 on wine,

327
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,343
you are very stupid.

328
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,644
Security.

329
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,146
I just want to thank
all the people that got me here:

330
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,150
Norbit, Pluto Nash,
all the klumps.

331
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:40,489
Congratulations to the next
Indiana master sommelier,

332
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:42,057
Xander Truffant.

333
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,795
Got to go talk to Xander
before Terrence gets to him.

334
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,431
Cover me.
Gotcha.

335
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:50,599
Oh, my goodness.

336
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:51,767
Mon dieu!

337
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:52,901
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

338
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:55,070
Oh, je suis desole, monsieur.

339
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,271
Allons-y.
Allons-y.

340
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,572
Xander.

341
00:10:57,607 --> 00:11:00,575
Look, Tom's Bistro
is going to be the dopest,

342
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,512
quite possibly trillest
restaurant in the area.

343
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:05,080
What do you say?
You want to work with me?

344
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:06,615
Thank you,
but I've already accepted

345
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,216
an offer
from Monsieur Montreaux.

346
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,419
I'll double
whatever he's paying you.

347
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,788
You'll pay me $500,000 a year?

348
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:16,224
I will pay you 1/10
of whatever he's paying you.

349
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,693
Sorry.

350
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,331
Oh, man.

351
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,666
This wine bottle
is all out of the wine.

352
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,501
Well, hello, gentlemen.

353
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:29,037
What brings you out
on this fine evening?

354
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:30,339
Mother[bleep].

355
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,873
Whoa.
Where'd you come from?

356
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,209
Uh, that's a complicated
question.

357
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:36,545
All depends on whether
your conception of time

358
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,914
is linear or circular.

359
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,916
What?

360
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,351
Hello, Ron.

361
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,352
Ron.

362
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,853
You know this hobo?

363
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:48,390
He was my counterpart from
the Eagleton Parks Department.

364
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:50,125
Dude, are you a ghost?

365
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,827
Am I?

366
00:11:53,997 --> 00:11:55,697
What is happening right now?

367
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:58,834
We know that you have
that important other engagement.

368
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,335
Yo, I gots to get that haircut.

369
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,503
Snoop!

370
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,017
It's not just Pawnee
that needs you.

371
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,506
It's the entire region.

372
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,841
Permission to speak, son?

373
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,343
Pawnee is kind of the gateway
to that whole region.

374
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,145
They do buy a lot of albums.

375
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,680
They sure ain't buying
toothpaste.

376
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:12,848
Bunch of dirty Hicks.

377
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,517
What if we fly me in and out
same day

378
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,552
so I wouldn't have to spend
a night in your crap town?

379
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:18,720
Excuse me.

380
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:19,888
Pawnee is a good town

381
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:22,257
with good people
from all walks of life.

382
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,259
Plus, it is an amazing place

383
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:25,927
to raise kids
and start a family.

384
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,262
You think I care about that?

385
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:29,097
Look, I can do whatever I want,
all right?

386
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:31,033
If I want to shoot
a paintball gun at my dad,

387
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,034
I'm gonna do it.

388
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:34,703
Good shot, son.

389
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:35,704
I'm proud of you.

390
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:36,705
You're crazy.

391
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:37,706
This is over, okay?

392
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,874
Pawnee does not need you.

393
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,242
And you should know that

394
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:43,111
when you shook my hand earlier,
there was pee on my palms.

395
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,346
That makes us sound like Hicks.

396
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,347
We're not.
Shut up.

397
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:46,502
Stupid. Okay.
Let's go, Andy.

398
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:50,846
You know what?
That was awesome.

399
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:51,560
You were great.

400
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:53,258
I thought you were gonna
punch that kid's lights out.

401
00:12:53,293 --> 00:12:56,519
It was not awesome.
I lost our headliner.

402
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,256
I can't stop throwing up,

403
00:12:58,376 --> 00:12:59,998
and Ben has not
called me back yet.

404
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:02,301
I'm sorry I'm so frazzled.

405
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,136
There's just a lot of things
going on right now,

406
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:06,305
personal things that
I can't talk to you about.

407
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:08,641
You know, Leslie,

408
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:12,478
sometimes life
throws us crazy curves,

409
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:15,714
and, yes, this moment may be

410
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:19,151
the biggest curve

411
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,819
you've ever had to deal with,

412
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:23,155
but just because
your family is getting bigger

413
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,824
does not mean
that you can't handle it.

414
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,793
You and Ben
can handle anything.

415
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:30,629
Wow.

416
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:31,897
Andy, thank you.

417
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:35,000
That's exactly
what I needed to hear right now.

418
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:36,669
God, it's so weird
that you know

419
00:13:36,703 --> 00:13:38,204
that I'm pregnant
before Ben does...

420
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,205
Pregnant?

421
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,439
Holy crap.

422
00:13:40,474 --> 00:13:41,774
Leslie!

423
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:43,475
Yeah.
Well, what did you think?

424
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,010
I thought
you were getting a dog.

425
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,245
Well, why did you go like this?

426
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,640
That's the sign
for petting a dog

427
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,814
that's sitting on your lap.

428
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:49,815
But pregnant?

429
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,816
Wow.

430
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,184
Oh, that's amazing.

431
00:13:52,219 --> 00:13:54,186
You know, Andy, I think
we need to focus on the fact

432
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,488
that we have lost
our headliner.

433
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:56,555
We are out of options.

434
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,990
It's time for a Hail Mary.

435
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:02,228
How are we gonna convince
this guy to reunite Land Ho?

436
00:14:02,262 --> 00:14:04,563
Same way I got a perfect score
on the S.A.T.s...

437
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:06,198
broken Scantron machine.

438
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,034
Okay, wait, Andy,
that is not a good strategy.

439
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,702
Okay, I will give him
a brief explanation

440
00:14:09,736 --> 00:14:10,870
about the unity concert,

441
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:13,372
and you stand by...

442
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:14,373
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

443
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:17,443
Hello?

444
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,545
Scott Tanner.

445
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:22,381
It's Scott Tanner.

446
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:24,216
Hi.
My name is Andy.

447
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,919
And this barfing lady over here
is Leslie.

448
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,387
We just need ten minutes
of your time.

449
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:29,522
To do what?

450
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:31,790
To convince you
to reunite Land Ho.

451
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,125
Listen, it means a lot to me

452
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,127
that you guys loved the band,

453
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:37,763
and I'm gonna tell you
the exact same thing

454
00:14:37,797 --> 00:14:41,534
I've told everyone
who's ever asked us to reunite:

455
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:43,369
No.

456
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:44,883
Listen, I know that
you and the band

457
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:46,705
aren't on the best of terms
right now.

458
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,374
But bringing people together

459
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:50,709
is exactly what we want
to talk to you about.

460
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,528
Pull that.
Hold it down on the bottom.

461
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,917
I got it, yeah.

462
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,453
Mr. Ron Dunn,

463
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:02,621
I have something
I'm very angry about,

464
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:06,225
but other Ron,
he's not helping me with it.

465
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:07,593
Can you help?

466
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,595
Well, I can tell
by the indigo on your chiclets

467
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,264
that you've been drinking
blueberry wine.

468
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:13,766
That's a good start.

469
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,603
The Wamapoke called it
mattapiqua.

470
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:20,139
They believed
it had mystical powers.

471
00:15:20,173 --> 00:15:22,308
Yeah, it also tastes
like jelly.

472
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:24,777
So what's got your goat there,
friend?

473
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:26,946
My parents,
they had this lake house,

474
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,914
and they sold it
without telling me.

475
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:31,350
And so I was like, "Why?"
You know?

476
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:34,019
I was like,
"God, you guys!"

477
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:35,688
Oh, you're hanging on
to that anger

478
00:15:35,722 --> 00:15:38,357
for dear life, compadre.

479
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:39,792
Let's role-play.

480
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:41,794
Well, good night, everyone.

481
00:15:41,828 --> 00:15:44,296
I'm going to go home
and feel totally fine.

482
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,631
Who am I kidding?

483
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:47,506
I'm going to go home,
put on a Macy Gray album,

484
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:48,801
and cry in the mirror!

485
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:49,802
Why are you bummed?

486
00:15:49,836 --> 00:15:51,303
Are you all blind?

487
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:52,972
I want that job
at Tom's Bistro.

488
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:55,141
I've been trying to show you
for the last five hours.

489
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:56,809
Look, man, you know your stuff,

490
00:15:56,843 --> 00:15:58,844
but you're like
a crazy volcano.

491
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,779
You'd have to show me
you can bring it down a notch.

492
00:16:00,814 --> 00:16:02,982
I'll bring it down
1,000 notches if I have to!

493
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:07,019
This looks like
it's gonna be a great concert.

494
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:09,121
The band
just does not play anymore.

495
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:10,456
Well, I understand.

496
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:13,192
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

497
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:14,827
My stomach
is trying to murder me.

498
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:16,295
Still drunk from last night?

499
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:17,396
I've been there.

500
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,864
You know,
this town still loves you.

501
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,167
I'm in a band myself actually...
Mouse Rat...

502
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,635
and we cover
about five of your songs,

503
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:23,636
and they just go nuts.

504
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,971

I mean, just listen.

539
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,493
Good evening.

540
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,027
May I assist you
with a wine tonight?

541
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,529
Yeah, I'm having fish,

542
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:26,532
so maybe a full-bodied...

543
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:27,633
red?

544
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,468
You know, sir,
you might want to consider

545
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,303
something white
to go with your fish.

546
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:33,973
No.
Red.

547
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,441
And bring some ice cubes.

548
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:36,642
I like ice cubes
in my red wine.

549
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:38,144
I'll have a glass

550
00:17:38,178 --> 00:17:40,146
of your most expensive red wine

551
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,982
mixed with a glass
of your cheapest white wine,

552
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,283
served in a dog bowl.

553
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:46,952
Silly straws all around,
please.

554
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:50,356
I'll be right back
with my recommendations.

555
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,724
Seems to be
keeping it together.

556
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:53,225
What kind of monster

557
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,061
orders red with fish?

558
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:56,335
I know they're messing with me,

559
00:17:56,363 --> 00:17:58,764
and it's just a test,
but have some decency.

560
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,535
For you, sir,
a light, crisp Pinot

561
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:03,869
with just a hint of lemon

562
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:06,405
to bring out the flavors
in your fish.

563
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,073
I brought you a bold Cabernet,

564
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:10,743
which should still taste okay
when watered down.

565
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:13,579
And for you, madam,
would you consider this rose?

566
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:16,048
It's halfway between
red and white.

567
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,716
Thanks very much.

568
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,485
Enjoy.

569
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,754
I think I may have found
my new sommelier.

570
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:23,989
That was so embarrassing!

571
00:18:24,024 --> 00:18:26,325
We'll have to make sure
the wine cellar at Tom's Bistro

572
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,326
is soundproof.

573
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:31,330
Hoy-hay!

574
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:33,065
Oh!

575
00:18:34,101 --> 00:18:35,734
That was beautiful.

576
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:38,070
You're surrendering
to the earth mother.

577
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:41,273
Now stare into the fire
and picture your spirit animal.

578
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:43,042
I don't know
what my spirit animal is.

579
00:18:43,076 --> 00:18:44,543
Because it doesn't exist,

580
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,313
because that's nonsense,
because you're an adult.

581
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:51,317
Baby snow owl.

582
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:52,685
He's right.

583
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:56,188
Our spirit animals connect us
to the natural world.

584
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:59,191
You need to remain open
to their message.

585
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:01,026
Watch.

586
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:08,434
Welcome back, old friend.

587
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:09,935
Whoa.

588
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,272
If you really want to
cleanse yourself of that anger,

589
00:19:13,306 --> 00:19:16,342
take that check
and send it into the flames

590
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:18,811
and up into the air
with your screams.

591
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:21,814
Do not burn that check.
It is money.

592
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,816
No.
Ron's right, Ron.

593
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:33,292
There, there, baby snow owl.

594
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:34,493
You're safe now.

595
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:40,258
This is him right here.

596
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,094
I will also get out here
and walk home.

597
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:43,261
You sure?

598
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:46,098
This thing runs on vegetable oil
and bat guano.

599
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:48,500
Actually cleans the air
as it drives.

600
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:50,202
Quite sure.
Thank you.

601
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:55,807
Hey, thank you

602
00:19:55,842 --> 00:19:57,776
for helping me with my anger.

603
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,746
You've already
emerged from your cocoon.

604
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,414
Now the question is:

605
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,616
Will you fly?

606
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:13,825
Yeah, I don't feel any better.

607
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,993
I'm still angry.

608
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,662
Damn it.

609
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,330
I don't know
why this lake house thing

610
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:19,998
is driving me so crazy.

611
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:23,669
I'm sorry we couldn't help you
work through your problems.

612
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:25,837
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a lady,

613
00:20:25,872 --> 00:20:29,408
two little girls, and an infant
waiting for me.

614
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,743
It's always nice to see the kids
at the end of a long day.

615
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:34,446
Really puts things
in perspective.

616
00:20:38,818 --> 00:20:41,119
Oh, my God, Ben.
I have so much to tell you.

617
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:44,323
We got Land Ho
to play the unity concert.

618
00:20:44,357 --> 00:20:45,824
Whoa.
What happened to you?

619
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,492
It doesn't matter.

620
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:50,328
I thought I was upset
because my parents are insane.

621
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:53,498
But Ron kind of just showed me
the real reason.

622
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,168
I have so many childhood
memories at that lake house

623
00:20:56,202 --> 00:20:57,669
that, in the back of my mind,

624
00:20:57,704 --> 00:21:00,339
I always pictured
taking my kids...

625
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:02,407
or taking our kids there.

626
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:04,509
I want to start our family.

627
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:06,178
I mean,
I know things are crazy,

628
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:08,380
but there's no good time,

629
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,816
and I want to do it now.

630
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,053
Well, buddy,
I got some good news for you.

631
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:23,007
