1
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:16,510
Are you getting ready
with Andy in London?

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,767
You look lovely.

3
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,235
I'm going to murder you
a thousand times.

4
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,586
Okay.

5
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:23,372
What the hell?

6
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:28,194
♪ Someone's back from London,
no, it's not the queen ♪

7
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:31,814
♪ someone's back from London,
it's not Mr. Bean ♪

8
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:33,332
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,918
♪ It's not the royal baby,
I think his name is Jeff ♪

10
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,737
Stop singing!
Kiss me!

11
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,356
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,791
Just missed you so bad, honey,

13
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,726
I bought myself a ticket home.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,730
You're never gonna need
that computer again

15
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:50,065
'cause I'm home for,
like, 19 hours.

16
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,334
This is so sweet.
Just like the old days.

17
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,020
Take a hike, Jerry.

18
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:55,955
It's Larry now.

19
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,373
Okay, take a hike, Larry.

00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,661
Next order of business,

22
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:22,415
Councilman Jamm
proposes Bill 949-c.

23
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,933
That's right, stretch,

24
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,302
and looking mighty fly
in that suit, brother.

25
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,637
Okay, this excellent bill
only allows

26
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,805
someone to vote
in a Pawnee election,

27
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,725
for example,
the upcoming recall election,

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,528
if their I.D. lists
an official Pawnee address.

29
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,947
Really, councilman?
Again?

30
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:39,265
The recall election
is coming up,

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,834
and Jamm keeps trying to figure
out ways to screw me over.

32
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,353
Last week, he tried to have me
listed on the ballot

33
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,023
as "Leslie Buttface Hitler
the Fourth."

34
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:48,524
All you're trying to do
is disenfranchise

35
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:50,242
the people
from former Eagleton,

36
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,027
people who will most likely
vote for me

37
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,346
because I saved
a lot of their jobs.

38
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,964
I move that we table
the discussion

39
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:55,982
until after the election.

40
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:56,966
- Second.
- Thank you!

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,034
- Ah!
- I'm so sorry.

42
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:00,720
I just get excited
when you like me.

43
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,773
I put my career on the line
by saving Eagleton,

44
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:05,508
and he's trying
to rob me of their votes?

45
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,592
Those are my votes.

46
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,260
I've earned them!
I want them!

47
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:09,328
Give me those votes!

48
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,080
I don't have them on me.

49
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:12,982
I can't believe Jamm
tried to pull that crap.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,300
I can.
He's a horrible monster.

51
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,751
But let's focus on
the more important issue.

52
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,987
You want to squeeze in
one more practice session?

53
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,823
Oh, do I?

54
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,075
Tonight, I am throwing Ben
his dream birthday party,

55
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,295
a roller skating bash
with an early '90s theme.

56
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,414
Ben lives for the early '90s.

57
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:30,466
The music, the fashion.
It's his favorite era.

58
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,135
As for the roller skating...

59
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,204
I have a thing
for women in skates. Okay?

60
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,973
Everyone has a thing,
and that's mine.

61
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,392
As far as things go,
it's pretty innocuous.

62
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,112
Could be one of those dudes that
kisses mannequins or whatever,

63
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:46,165
but I like a woman in skates.

64
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,234
A lot.

65
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,654
Hey, Ann, Ann called.

66
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,123
She wants her ugly outfit back.

67
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,591
Why are you dressed
as a pilgrim?

68
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,160
Leslie said it was a "Come
As You Were in the '90s" party.

69
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,862
I assumed it was the 1690s.

70
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,631
Babe, if it was the 1690s,
we'd all be mummies.

71
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:04,900
What do you think mummies are?

72
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:05,901
Skeletons?

73
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,253
- Oh, boy.
- Hey.

74
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,371
I just came straight from work,
so I couldn't dress up.

75
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,829
No problem.
You look wiggidy-wiggidy-

76
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,241
wiggidy-wiggidy-wonderful.

77
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,475
Wait a minute.
Pants on backwards.

78
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,679
Kris Kross, right?
Nice!

79
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,130
What happens when
you have to pee?

80
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:19,432
I actually just went.

81
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,100
I had to pull my pants
all the way to the ground

82
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:22,334
like a toddler.

83
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,287
Nadia, the super hot doctor,

84
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,789
has been hanging out with me
for the last week.

85
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,908
She's definitely
out of my league.

86
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,110
Actually, we're not even
playing the same sport.

87
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,045
It's kind of like she's in NBA

88
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:35,347
and I work at a muffler store
next to the stadium.

89
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,348
I can't believe we met
just before

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
you have to go
on your stupid vacation.

91
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,835
I'm doing doctors
without borders, man.

92
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,137
I'm going to Rwanda.

93
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,839
Exactly.
That's a stupid vacation.

94
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:46,492
Okay, well, why don't you
win me that huge-ass bear

95
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,993
as a going-away present?

96
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,045
No problem.
I'm a skee ball master.

97
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,930
No way!
Why don't you go pro?

98
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,732
I don't know.
I didn't want to be a cliche.

99
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,000
Yet another professional
Indian skee ball player?

100
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:55,984
Right.

101
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,723
Now that's what
I call shooting.

102
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,159
Is this a hunting game?

103
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:04,210
Yeah, it's fun.
You want to play?

104
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:05,594
Indeed, I do.

105
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:08,931
If you'd like,
I could offer you some pointers.

106
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,000
Hunting, Donna,

107
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:14,603
is about silence,
balance, and patience.

108
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,323
Get ready.

109
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:24,530
You know you're supposed
to hit the deer, rig?

110
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,149
Ugh!

111
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,451
Get it together, Swanson.

112
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,086
Well, the game is absurd.

113
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,987
This gun is lightweight,
there's no sight,

114
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,823
and we are far too close
to these deer.

115
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,524
Would they not smell us?

116
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:37,593
I want my money back.
How do I get my quarters?

117
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,661
Oh, my God!
You are such a sore loser.

118
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,639
I am not a sore loser.

119
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:41,847
It's just that I prefer to win,

120
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,949
and when I don't,
I get furious.

121
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,734
Employee!

122
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,155
Whoa! Watch this.

123
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,506
Oh, that was brilliant.

124
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,474
Sorry. You probably
don't know what that means.

125
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,310
You know how you Americans say
"cool" when something's cool?

126
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:56,745
Over in London, we say,
"That's brilliant."

127
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,047
Speaking of London,

128
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:59,548
you haven't told me
anything about work.

129
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,206
- You still love it?
- Yeah, it's awesome.

130
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,651
I'm kicking ass.

131
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,953
I'm like Chuck Norris,
only instead of crushing

132
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,558
bad guys' skulls,
I'm crushing documents.

133
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:10,893
- that's great.
- Yeah.

134
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,728
Now be the Chuck Norris
of making out with me.

135
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,864
I'll karate punch your face
with my tongue.

136
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,185
- Prove it.
- Hi-yah.

137
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,753
Get this.

138
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,005
I just asked the DJ
what rem albums he has.

139
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,976
He's got Monster, but not
Automatic For the People.

140
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,994
- Wow!
- I know.

141
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,579
It's like, what is this?
A mid-'90s party?

142
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:32,314
No.
It's an early '90s party.

143
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,166
Okay, Larry.
Tell us how this looks.

144
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:35,985
Ben wants to do
a synchronized couple skate

145
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:37,186
to Losing My Religion.

146
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,154
Hit it!

147
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,593
Leslie!
Leslie! Leslie!

148
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:46,395
I'm sorry,
but we have a problem.

149
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,147
His name is Jeremy Jamm.

150
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:49,448
Well, as noted in Article
nine, Paragraph two...

151
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:50,916
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

152
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,801
Jamm, I thought
this bill was tabled?

153
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,721
Yes, and I called a special
session and un-tabled it.

154
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,990
What's up with the roller skates?

155
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,376
I was about to attend
a roller skating birthday party

156
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,277
for my husband,
but this is more important.

157
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,263
Yeah, I don't care.
I'm a blades guy.

158
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,431
Point of order!

159
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,099
The councilwoman
wishes to speak on this issue.

160
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,184
Will the councilwoman
yield her time

161
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,452
so we can vote on this sucker?

162
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,454
No, I will not yield.

163
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,307
Nor will I yield
for the rest of the evening.

164
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,408
A filibuster?

165
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,394
Are you dookin'
on my chest right now?

166
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,429
No! Gross!

167
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,064
And yes, it's a filibuster.

168
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:23,232
Okay?

169
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,600
I am not willing
to let you deprive me...

170
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,669
She's filibustering
on roller skates?

171
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:29,154
She's gonna be strapped
into those things for hours.

172
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,689
I know this
is a dire situation,

173
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,941
but I swear to God,
this is like

174
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,026
a crazy sex fantasy for me.

175
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:43,798
How goes it?

176
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:46,740
Pretty good,
except I suck at skee ball.

177
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,492
Well, that's too bad, 'cause
if you don't win me that bear,

178
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:49,659
you're dead to me.

179
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:51,095
Understood.

180
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:53,095
Hey, man, how many tickets
for that bear, again?

181
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:56,458
- 40,000.
- 40,000? Oh, brother.

182
00:06:56,492 --> 00:07:00,395
All right, you're gonna be
my lookout for a second.

183
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,863
Hey, is he allowed to do that?

184
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:03,532
No!
Get off the ramp, dude!

185
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,801
Hey! You're supposed
to be my lookout.

186
00:07:05,852 --> 00:07:07,602
I thought it'd be funnier
to watch you get busted.

187
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,871
Hey, you're a doctor.
You know snitches get stitches.

188
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:12,674
I remember
the first time I voted.

189
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,243
I was in my bedroom,
and I was five.

190
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:17,596
I voted for Mildred,
my stuffed pig,

191
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,765
but my cat, pancakes, won.

192
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:21,132
She had more funding.

193
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,019
Politics, right?
What are you gonna do?

194
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:25,420
How long have I been talking?
Three hours?

195
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:26,538
No, eight minutes.
Okay.

196
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:28,506
Maybe you should
yield the floor.

197
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:29,574
Milton doesn't
have a lot of time...

198
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:30,942
left on earth.

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,544
Hey, just kidding, bud.

200
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,396
Will someone open my crackers?

201
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,380
The session ends
at 11:00 P.M.

202
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:37,666
She has to talk the whole time.

203
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,551
She can't lean on anything
for support,

204
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,253
and no one else can help her.

205
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:43,071
Three strikes and she is done.

206
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:44,623
This is literally

207
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:46,291
the most exciting thing
that I've ever seen.

208
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:47,259
I mean, think about it.

209
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,443
Where else on earth
would you rather

210
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:49,794
spend your birthday
with Leslie?

211
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:51,646
Well, maybe the birthday party

212
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,865
she's throwing for me
right now.

213
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:56,735
Everyone in Pawnee
should have the right to vote.

214
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:57,736
Whoa!

215
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,738
As I dissect this important

216
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:01,223
and profound statement,

217
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:02,390
I'm just gonna
take these off for a second.

218
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:05,193
Bam, strike one.
No sitting.

219
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,797
Is the gong really necessary?

220
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:11,249
Yes, it is.
I love Chinese crap.

221
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,785
Lucy Liu, Nintendo,
Gangnam Style,

222
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,187
sushi, et cetera, et cetera.

223
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,056
Also, more importantly,
it's in the rules. No sitting.

224
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,307
Okay, fine.

225
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:20,475
Well, the strike is worth it
if I can take these off.

226
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,260
Oh, man!

227
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,279
Oh, my God!

228
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,716
I had this exact bear
when I was a kid!

229
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,167
- Excuse me.
- Uh-huh.

230
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:30,569
How much does this bear cost?

231
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,487
40,000 tickets.

232
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:34,206
Okay, well, let's
just assume that I'm an adult

233
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,725
who doesn't have two weeks
to play arcade games.

234
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,261
What about 50 bucks?

235
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:40,862
Yeah.
Just don't tell my boss.

236
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:43,058
- What are you doing, Morris?
- Nothing, Mr. Bonderman.

237
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,801
- Tuck in your shirt. God!
- Sorry.

238
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:48,370
Oh! You feeling it?

239
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,259
Wow.
You suck at this.

240
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:56,695
Donna, please back up two paces

241
00:08:56,729 --> 00:08:58,930
so I can physically
destroy this machine.

242
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:02,450
Can you chill a little, man?
It's not real hunting.

243
00:09:02,485 --> 00:09:03,735
It's just a game.

244
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:04,850
That you happen to suck at.

245
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:07,005
You know what?
That's a good point.

246
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,640
What?
That you suck at this?

247
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,943
That it's not re hunting.
Come with me.

248
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,548
I don't want you
to go back to London.

249
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,622
Just remember, every time
you look up at the moon,

250
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:21,653
I, too, will be
looking at a moon.

251
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:23,788
Not the same moon, obviously.
That's impossible.

252
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:26,474
See you on stupid Skype.

253
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:30,962
I'm proud of Andy.

254
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:33,982
This is the first time
he's really gone out on a limb.

255
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,818
I knew if he found something
that he actually liked doing,

256
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:39,838
he'd be happy, so I'm...

257
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,842
What the hell?
Wha...

258
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,745
Hey! Perkins!
What are you doing with my bear?

259
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:48,763
I've been playing skee ball
for, like, two hours

260
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:49,848
trying to win that for Nadia.

261
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,433
I just bought it for 50 bucks.

262
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:52,584
When I was a kid,

263
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:54,819
I taught myself
how to make out on this bear,

264
00:09:54,837 --> 00:09:56,354
pretended it was cockroach
from The Cosby Show.

265
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:59,774
Hey, what's going on here?
Why does blossom have my bear?

266
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:02,544
I bought it for myself,
but apparently,

267
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:04,145
he was trying to win it
for you, so I'm sorry.

268
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,296
I still got
some tickets, though.

269
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,399
I could get you, uh,
a ninja turtle balloon

270
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,618
or Cliffhanger on VHS.

271
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,419
Oh, that's so sweet,

272
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,305
but you're basically
offering me garbage.

273
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,241
Let's just skate.

274
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,195
That bear was the only thing
she was gonna have

275
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,461
to remember me by in Rwanda.

276
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,013
And if I know anything
about Rwanda, and I don't,

277
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:23,365
I bet it's full of rich guys

278
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,866
who'll buy her
whatever she wants.

279
00:10:29,989 --> 00:10:33,675
Hunting.
No quarters required.

280
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:35,960
Hang on.

281
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:37,646
Do you have a license
to hunt at night?

282
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,532
'Cause you need a license.

283
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,758
I thought you were serious.

284
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:52,944
Come on now.
You know I don't give a [bleep].

285
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,229
As Ronald Reagan would say,

286
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:59,100
"Well, mommy, I believe
voting rights are important."

287
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:01,019
Does anyone else
think it's hot in here?

288
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,553
These overalls
are really starchy.

289
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:04,823
Yeah, maybe that's 'cause
I turned up the heat to 90,

290
00:11:04,857 --> 00:11:07,509
and, uh, oh, the knob
broke off in my hand.

291
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,678
Oops.

292
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,947
Well, speaking of heat,

293
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:14,449
we should discuss
America's white-hot passion

294
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,234
for voting rights
and the men and women

295
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:17,218
who help protect them,

296
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,020
like the local
city councilwoman

297
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:21,406
who is starving and thinking
about her husband's

298
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,941
Reservoir Dog- themed
birthday cake

299
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:23,908
and wanting to eat it
really badly.

300
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:25,760
Oh, this is not a good sign.

301
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:28,213
Once she starts
thinking about birthday cake,

302
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:31,516
she's basically useless
until she eats birthday cake.

303
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,484
Democracy is not unlike a cake.

304
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:36,304
It's layered, delicious,
chocolate, and I want some.

305
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,322
Okay, she's fading.

306
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:39,157
Ben, we need to find
a way to smuggle

307
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,043
some mineral oil drops
onto her tongue.

308
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:44,012
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Excuse me.

309
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:45,496
What the hell
are you people doing here?

310
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:47,799
We represent the citizens
of former Eagleton.

311
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:49,334
We're here to support
Leslie Knope

312
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:51,092
for preserving
our voting rights.

313
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,403
Thank you!

314
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,173
You are all warriors
of democracy.

315
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:58,860
You know, it was the first mayor
of Pawnee, in 1817,

316
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:01,913
who said, "All we have
is the right to vote

317
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:03,765
and the right to kill Indians
without consequence."

318
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,234
And I believe that half
of that statement

319
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:07,452
is still true today.

320
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:11,039
All right!

321
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,925
Second wind!

322
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,644
Andy, I know you're in there.

323
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:19,664
Andy, come on.

324
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,019
Oh, hey.

325
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:26,154
I was just...

326
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:28,957
just here in this dumpster
'cause I jumped in.

327
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:31,343
Get out!
We need to talk.

328
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,261
About what?

329
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:38,016
Fresh air, real weapons,
an honest kill.

330
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,220
There is no substitute
for the real thing.

331
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,291
You want to go back and play
that video game, don't you?

332
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:49,694
Yes! Damn it!

333
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:53,081
It is so inspiring
to see Eagletonians

334
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:55,050
putting aside their prejudices.

335
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:57,168
With support like this,
Leslie Knope

336
00:12:57,202 --> 00:12:59,470
may stand a fighting chance
on recall day.

337
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:02,440
- Permission to hug you.
- Granted.

338
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:04,459
I should mention, though,

339
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,994
that we're not voting
to keep Leslie.

340
00:13:06,045 --> 00:13:07,746
What?

341
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,080
We want someone from Eagleton

342
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:11,582
to represent our interests
on the new city council.

343
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,918
Sir, I formally revoke our hug.

344
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:15,687
Well, you can't.
It happened.

345
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:19,224
We stand on the side
of Rosa Parks,

346
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,427
and Gandhi, and Team Aniston.

347
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,696
One small vote for Pawnee

348
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,483
is one giant leap
of voting for mankind.

349
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:29,951
Hey!

350
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:32,153
Hey, you're not allowed
to receive help from the crowd.

351
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:34,906
That's strike two.

352
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,908
Hey, man, leave my gong alone.

353
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,243
The reverb is the best part.

354
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,961
If I save your right to vote,

355
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:42,297
you're gonna vote
for someone from Eagleton?

356
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:46,610
Eagleton! Eagleton!

357
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,603
Hey, Knope! Wrap it up!

358
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:49,631
I'm not gonna yield.

359
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:51,655
I just... I need some time to think.

360
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:54,558
And because I must keep talking,
I'm gonna think out loud.

361
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:58,045
Okay, if Eagletonians
vote for someone else,

362
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,810
then it would be in my
best interest to stop, right?

363
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,119
So they can't vote.

364
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,541
Uh, da-doy.
Yield.

365
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:07,646
Or I keep going,

366
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:10,896
because the right to vote
is fundamental in any democracy,

367
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:12,807
and this is bigger than me
or anyone.

368
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:14,643
I don't care if I lose.

369
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:16,828
No one prevents people
in my town from voting.

370
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:18,096
Not on my watch.

371
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,098
The filibuster is on!

372
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:22,150
Yeah!

373
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:23,451
Okay.

374
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:24,636
I can't go back to London.

375
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,756
I'm totally in over my head
on this project.

376
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,240
Every day, someone
comes up to me and says,

377
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:31,409
"I need your approval
on this, Mr. Dwyer."

378
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,011
"I need your signature,
Mr. Dwyer."

379
00:14:33,062 --> 00:14:34,295
"That's not a toilet,
Mr. Dwyer."

380
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:36,665
But you said everything
was going awesome.

381
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:38,299
You said you
were like Chuck Norris.

382
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,834
I am, but I'm
like Chuck Norris now...

383
00:14:39,852 --> 00:14:42,704
some old guy with a beard
who used to be good at karate

384
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,656
but became a dumb has-been

385
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,776
and is scared and confused
about his big London job.

386
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,993
Okay.

387
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:51,179
The parallels between
he and I are very eerie.

388
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:53,648
I'm gonna tell you a secret
about everyone else's job.

389
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,066
Okay.

390
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:56,835
No one knows
what they're doing.

391
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:59,854
I don't know how to run
an animal control department.

392
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,873
Half the documents I get
I put right into the shredder

393
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,208
because they're so boring.

394
00:15:03,242 --> 00:15:05,293
But you seem like you
do know what you're doing.

395
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:06,561
Yeah, I seem like it.

396
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:09,030
Deep down,
everyone is just faking it

397
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:12,150
until they figure it out.

398
00:15:12,184 --> 00:15:14,085
And you will too,
because you are awesome

399
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,071
and everyone else sucks.

400
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,359
- 30 minutes to go.
- Oh, God, it's so hot.

401
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:23,461
Almost as hot as the flames

402
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:25,764
that Eagleton
would have gone down in

403
00:15:25,815 --> 00:15:27,215
if I had not saved them.

404
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:33,271
Mm, mm, mm.

405
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:36,024
- That's...
- How I know you would love

406
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:39,594
an ice-cold frozen marg.

407
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:41,730
All I want
is the promise of democracy.

408
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:42,864
Sure about that?

409
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:44,916
- I want that marg.
- I know you do.

410
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,218
- I want that Margarita.
- Oh, it's gonna be so good.

411
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,003
So cold.
It's so cold.

412
00:15:49,021 --> 00:15:51,623
- I want to drink it.
- Make that heat go away!

413
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:54,259
Come on, get!

414
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:55,810
Come on, girl.
Get!

415
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,729
Give me that Margarita!

416
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,049
No!
I want votes.

417
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:06,387
Excuse me, worker,

418
00:16:06,405 --> 00:16:08,489
bring me a bucket of beers
and four hot dogs.

419
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:09,490
Please, and thank you.

420
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:11,509
Why are you covered in blood?

421
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,478
Don't worry.
It's not human.

422
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:15,780
I hope you've made peace
with your God,

423
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:17,832
small electronic deer.

424
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,801
Kill it.

425
00:16:19,835 --> 00:16:21,619
Ann, I need that bear.

426
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:23,404
I got to give Nadia
something awesome

427
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:24,956
so she'll remember me
when she's in Africa.

428
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,893
Tom, bear or no bear,
she clearly likes you.

429
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:31,279
Actually, how do you even
get girls like her...

430
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:32,864
or me...
to go out with you?

431
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:34,532
Scientists say
the emotions of love and hate

432
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,650
are very close to each other.

433
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:36,851
That's what I tell women.

434
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:39,103
The point is,
she's leaving in two days.

435
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:41,156
You want her to remember you?

436
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,157
Go spend time with her

437
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:44,008
and do something
memorable, dummy!

438
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:45,477
Thanks, Ann.

439
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:47,128
I know conversations
like this are hard for you

440
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:48,646
'cause you still
have feelings for me,

441
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:50,281
but you'll land
on your feet, kid.

442
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:52,851
- Run or I punch you.
- No punchies!

443
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:56,771
Okay, bye for real this time.

444
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:01,009
Wait, wait, wait.

445
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,727
I made you five bologna
sandwiches

446
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,162
in case you get hungry
on the way to the airport.

447
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:05,279
Did you...

448
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:06,798
Yes, I used cookies
instead of bread.

449
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:08,933
You think of everything.
I love you.

450
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,269
Love you too.

451
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,459
Are you kidding me?

452
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:21,479
- Andy!
- Ha! Ha! Found it!

453
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,031
I got... I left my wallet
in here earlier, I guess.

454
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,217
Whoo! All good now.

455
00:17:26,268 --> 00:17:28,135
Ooh, look!
Noodles!

456
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:30,488
No, no, no, babe.
Babe, don't touch those.

457
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,123
I've read the entire charter.

458
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:35,243
There's no other way
to get her a bathroom break...

459
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:39,046
unless we bring
the bathroom to her...

460
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,064
that's nothing.

461
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,616
I mean,
she's not gonna make it.

462
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,152
Look at her, she's dancing
around like she's a character

463
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:45,820
in one of those
Peanuts cartoons.

464
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:49,173
Okay,
in these last few minutes,

465
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:53,394
I would like to talk about
the voting rights act of 1968

466
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:56,531
while clenching every muscle
in my body.

467
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:57,699
Sound good?

468
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,901
Hey, Knope,
how you feeling over there?

469
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,920
You go pee-pee?
Pee-pee times?

470
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:03,254
Make wee-wee?

471
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:04,255
Ten more seconds.

472
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:08,643
Four, three, two, one!

473
00:18:08,677 --> 00:18:11,545
This session is adjourned.

474
00:18:11,564 --> 00:18:13,648
All pending matters are tabled.

475
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:17,318
Yes!

476
00:18:17,353 --> 00:18:19,070
- You were amazing.
- I love you, but move!

477
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,221
I have to go
to the whiz palace.

478
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:21,222
Oh, wait!

479
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,857
Eagleton! Eagleton!

480
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:27,111
Oh!
My beautiful curls!

481
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:28,562
She didn't have time to hug me,

482
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:29,948
but she could do that?

483
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:34,938
Hey, Ann, can I talk to you
for a second? About Tom?

484
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:35,892
Sure.

485
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,440
You guys look like
you're having fun.

486
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:38,736
Yeah, no, I really like him.

487
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,289
I just wanted to say that
I think you're really cool,

488
00:18:41,323 --> 00:18:43,670
and the fact that Tom dated you

489
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,207
makes me think
he's a really good guy.

490
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:47,543
That's so sweet.

491
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:50,246
Oh, okay.

492
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,247
Wha... what are you...

493
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,698
- What the hell?
- Now!

494
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,966
Sorry, Ann, this is on you.

495
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,748
You told us to make a memory.

496
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,702
- There's your money back.
- Let go!

497
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,705
Suck it!

498
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,707
This is $8!

499
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,059
- Man, that was so much fun.
- Yeah.

500
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:06,211
Together,
we truly did steal a toy

501
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,813
from your pregnant friend.

502
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:10,266
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,652
I know we just met, like,
two weeks ago and whatever,

504
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,988
but is there any chance maybe,

505
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,323
when you get back,
we can maybe...

506
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,892
Ugh. Clingy.

507
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,227
Oh, no. Sorry.
No, no, no, no.

508
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,229
I'm kidding.

509
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,748
Of course I'll call you
when I come back.

510
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:28,117
- Really?
- Yeah.

511
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,953
So long, suckers!

512
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,588
Hey! Quick!

513
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,426
Ooh!

514
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

515
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,962
Now that's what I call shooting.

516
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,514
- Come on!
- That's a new record!

517
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:42,548
Hey!
Look at that!

518
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,850
You finally made it
in the top 10.

519
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:46,135
Now you can
enter your initials.

520
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,470
My initials are private.

521
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,774
Then just put in
any three letters.

522
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:57,780
Ass.

523
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,769
Oh, my God!
That was epic!

524
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:04,987
I was peeing so freakin' hard,

525
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,455
it was like
a jacuzzi jet or...

526
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:08,624
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hey! Ingrid!

527
00:20:08,658 --> 00:20:11,043
I wasn't talking
about the velocity of my pee

528
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:12,837
because you are a very smart
and classy lady.

529
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,280
Ben, you remember
Ingrid de Forest

530
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,715
from the former Eagleton.

531
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,968
Yes, she was just telling me
she's been nominated

532
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:21,670
to run against you
in the recall.

533
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,956
Wow.
Buzz kill.

534
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,808
I know you must hate me
right now, Leslie,

535
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:27,560
and that's justified,

536
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:31,063
but I need to thank you
for what you just did in there.

537
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,681
Not the forceful urination.
The filibuster.

538
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,983
Right, yeah.

539
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:37,636
It was incredibly courageous,
and it was selfless.

540
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,971
And if I do win,

541
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,139
I'm gonna have very big
roller skates to fill.

542
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,693
Could I take you out
for a celebratory plate of...

543
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,995
I think you call them waffles?

544
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:48,080
Wow, that is the best offer
you could ever make,

545
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:51,433
but I had to miss my husband's
birthday party for this,

546
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,686
so I think I'll be spending
the evening with him.

547
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,756
- A rain check, maybe.
- Please.

548
00:20:57,774 --> 00:21:00,693
I'm sorry your birthday party
got all screwed up.

549
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,394
Maybe I should put
those roller skates back on.

550
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,646
Well, you must be exhausted.

551
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:04,780
We don't have
to go to the party.

552
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:06,782
Oh, we're not
going to the party.

553
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:08,367
We're going home.

554
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:11,103
Then why would you need
to put on roller... skates?

555
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:13,605
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

556
00:21:13,623 --> 00:21:16,913
We're just...
we're just... skates...
