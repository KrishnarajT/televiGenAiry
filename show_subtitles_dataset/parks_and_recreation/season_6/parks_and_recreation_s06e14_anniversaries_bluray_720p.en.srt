1
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:04,352
"Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt
were married

2
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:06,888
"one year ago this week
at the Pawnee city hall.

3
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:09,491
"The bride wore a gown made
by her friend Ann Perkins.

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:12,627
"And the groom wore a butt so perfect
it could make an angel hang itself."

5
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:14,962
- You wrote this, didn't you?
- I did.

6
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:17,011
- They cut it way down.
- Thank God.

7
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:19,923
Okay, so, the big day is tomorrow.

8
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,646
So let's go over this again.
What are the anniversary rules?

9
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,992
At lease 100 kisses.

10
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:25,226
Dinner at 7:00.

11
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:27,829
- And no gifts.
- That's right, no gifts.

12
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:29,569
No gifts.

13
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:31,566
No gifts.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,068
Oh, I'm getting him a gift.

15
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:34,970
I always say that I'm not gonna
get him a gift.

16
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:36,771
And Ben always believes me.

17
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:38,406
And then, bam, I surprise him

18
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,908
with the best gift of all time.

19
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:43,578
He makes the cutest, dopiest
face when he's surprised.

20
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:47,582
It's like... Wha-a-a-at?

21
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,818
I'm not gonna make my stupid
surprise face this year

22
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:52,654
because this time I got her
the most amazing gift ever.

23
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:54,022
And she'll never see it coming

24
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:56,525
because I'm giving it
to her today, one day early.

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,393
So she's gonna make
the face this year.

26
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:01,363
She will make that stupid face!

31
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:34,129
dedicated to the idea
that all human beings

deserve a chance to hear about

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,002
Welcome to
Thought For Your Thoughts.

34
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:43,805
I'm your Pawneean host,
Derry Murbles.

35
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:47,242
And I'm your Eagletonian host,
August Clementine.

36
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:50,879
Yes, if you have not heard
our program in a while,

37
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,415
Thought For Your Thoughts
now has a co-host,

38
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:56,318
thanks to
the Pawnee-Eagleton merger

39
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:59,020
I believe that is
the Eagleton-Pawnee merger,

40
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:00,188
n'est-ce pas?

41
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:02,824
I'd like to apologize to our listeners

42
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:07,028
for my co-host's sudden
and violent outburst just now.

43
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:11,466
Our guest is former city
councilwoman Leslie Knope.

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,235
- Leslie, thought...
- For your thoughts.

45
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,603
I said it.

46
00:02:15,638 --> 00:02:18,807
Absorb the aggression, Derry.

47
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:21,109
Absorb the aggression.

48
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:23,845
Well, I just want
to say thank you so much

49
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,746
for having me.

50
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,081
It's a thrill to be here.

51
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:29,217
As a listener, I think
the merging of your two shows

52
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:33,855
has really created such a big,
quiet, arcane ball of fun.

53
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,124
It's been a couple of months
since Pawnee and Eagleton

54
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:37,158
officially merged.

55
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:40,095
Things are going... okay.

56
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,031
There's still a little animosity
between the two towns.

57
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:44,933
I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad

58
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:48,737
since Frankie's discontinued
their pizza-stuffed-crust pizza.

59
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:52,774
It was a pizza whose crust
was stuffed with little pizzas.

60
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:55,043
And the crust of those little pizzas

61
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:56,978
was made of chocolate.

62
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:59,514
Ms. Knope, I understand
you're here today

63
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:01,049
to try to convince us

64
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,685
that this disastrous merger
of our two towns

65
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,421
was, in any way, a good idea.

66
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:08,657
Yes, there were some
bumps and bruises.

67
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:11,393
And a brief rash of arson.

68
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:15,096
And a rather large-scale brawl
at the dump.

69
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:19,567
But overall, the state
of the merger is very strong.

70
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:20,669
Scoff.

71
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:23,071
Did you just say the word "scoff"?

72
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:27,242
You must admit, Ms. Knope,
that the merging of the towns

73
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:29,177
has been fraught with antipathy.

74
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:32,280
For example, I now have
to share my studio

75
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:36,418
with a fatuous twerp
who shall remain nameless.

76
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:37,819
This twerp has a name.

77
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:41,656
And it's August N'gutu
Liebowitz-Clementine.

78
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,458
Guys...

79
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:44,926
Hello.

80
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:46,761
Thank you so much

81
00:03:46,796 --> 00:03:48,630
for letting me help plan
your anniversary.

82
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:51,299
It is so wonderful to be part
of such a special day.

83
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,435
Okay, remember,
under no circumstances

84
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,170
can Leslie know
about what's going on.

85
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,706
She has to make that face,
do you understand?

86
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,841
No, I don't fully,
but my lips are sealed.

87
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:01,543
I asked for Larry's help
because he has

88
00:04:01,577 --> 00:04:03,411
the most successful marriage
of anyone I know,

89
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:05,580
to a gorgeous woman.

90
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:08,583
Which, honestly,
is still a mystery to me.

91
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:11,920
Like, was it a hypnosis
accident or something,

92
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:13,154
where they put Gayle under

93
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,357
and made her fall in love with Larry

94
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:17,325
and never said the magic word
to snap her out of it?

95
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,394
Like, if I say "nutmeg,"

96
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,997
will she wake up and start screaming?

97
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:24,466
What kind of pet are you
interested in adopting?

98
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,601
We have dogs, cats, rabbits.

99
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:29,437
Um, I work here, so, legally,
you can adopt me.

100
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,840
The girls want an actual dog.

101
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:34,142
And they want it to look like this.

102
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:35,176
Interesting.

103
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:38,413
So, like a banana made of spiders?

104
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:40,382
I've said it before
and I'll say it again,

105
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,684
children are terrible artists.

106
00:04:42,718 --> 00:04:45,053
And artists are crooks.

107
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:46,788
I think I know a good dog.

108
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:48,990
There he is!

109
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,226
Ron, how about this guy?

110
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,728
Yes, he is a handsome fellow.

111
00:04:53,763 --> 00:04:55,096
Hello, dog.

112
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:56,531
I'll take him.

113
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,600
That was easy. Awesome.

114
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:01,870
Well, Donna can help you
get started on the paperwork.

115
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:03,972
Donna?

116
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:06,875
"Why lie? I'm shopping.
Back in an hour."

117
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:11,780
Ugh! God, she's always just
leaving and not telling me.

118
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:13,782
Hello, caller. You have a comment?

119
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:15,650
Yeah, ever since the merger,

120
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:18,186
we've had a really bad trash problem.

121
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,221
Well, yes, there has been
some confusion

122
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,656
with some of the garbage routes.

123
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:24,192
And the Sanitation Department
is stretched a little thin.

124
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:27,195
No, I mean Eagletonians
are human garbage.

125
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:29,030
And we should throw them
in a dumpster.

126
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:30,198
Kapow!

127
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,434
Yeah, I really like the merger,

128
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:34,969
but I hate that Eagleton
was forced to join Pawnee.

129
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,871
Well, that's what the merger is.

130
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:39,841
Oh. Yeah, then I hate the merger.

131
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,943
I think the merger was great.

132
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:45,547
And I think Leslie Knope
did an amazing job.

133
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,782
I don't know who this is,
but I agree.

134
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:49,084
- It's Andy!
- Hey.

135
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:50,652
I'm on the radio!

136
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:53,355
That's all the time we have on
Thought For Your Thoughts.

137
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:56,558
- I'm Derry Murbles.
- And I'm August Clementine.

138
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:59,861
And I talked last. Good day.

139
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,698
Is this land mine still functional?

140
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,768
Partially.

141
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,003
Why?

142
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:10,005
Because I want to blow up
Donna's desk

143
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:11,750
so I can teach her
a lesson about what happens

144
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,254
when you skip work.

145
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,943
I'm not sure that's how
you should go about this.

146
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:18,980
I'm kind of her boss, now,
but I still feel weird disciplining her.

147
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:19,981
What do I do?

148
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:23,485
Look her in the eyes and tell her
exactly what you need from her.

149
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,222
Be mature, direct, and firm.

150
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:30,192
What? Some fool
just slammed me on Yelp.

151
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:31,593
I took Ron's advice.

152
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:34,562
I very maturely and straightforwardly

153
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:37,232
left anonymous comments
about Donna online.

154
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,668
"Stopped by to adopt a dog,

155
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:41,703
"but the employee, Donna Meagle,

156
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:43,171
"was nowhere to be found.

157
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:46,541
Thanks for nothing,
Donna Meagle. Booooo!"

158
00:06:46,575 --> 00:06:48,276
With five "O's.

159
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,744
Oh, my God, that sucks.

160
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,080
Just have to work harder,
I guess, huh?

161
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:55,150
This freak thinks he can hide
behind some anonymous user name?

162
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:58,587
I'm about to hunt you down.

163
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:01,323
Don't be upset, Leslie.
No one listens to the radio.

164
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:03,591
I wasn't even listening.
I was listening to podcasts.

165
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,126
Podcasts are great.
Radio is boring.

166
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:07,128
Tom, this merger needs a win...

167
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:09,397
something symbolic
and bright and happy

168
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,566
that will show that there's
light at the end of the tunnel.

169
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,068
God, I am so stressed.

170
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,704
Uh, Leslie, may I borrow you
for a second?

171
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,205
Something very special to show you.

172
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,341
Now is not the time, Larry.
Please leave.

173
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,509
- I think you...
- Larry! What are you still doing here?

174
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:23,278
Aw, jeez. Okay.

175
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:26,848
I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton
were as happy as Ben and me.

176
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:28,650
Yeah, by the way,
I was gonna mention,

177
00:07:28,684 --> 00:07:30,285
you look really old in this picture.

178
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,753
What?

179
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:33,655
Andy, this is a picture of us.

180
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,223
This is a picture of an elderly couple.

181
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:36,358
Rosie and Doug DeMarco.

182
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:37,826
They've been married for 50 years.

183
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,228
"Rosie Hails from Pawnee,
while Doug is originally

184
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:42,230
from the former Eagleton."

185
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:44,132
Oh, my God, this is perfect.

186
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,302
A Pawnee-Eagleton couple that
has been married for 50 years

187
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:50,138
is a perfect symbol of how
our towns can get along.

188
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,907
And we are gonna hold them up
as an example

189
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:54,276
of Pawnee-Eagleton unity.

190
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,212
Whoo! I'm getting
the epiphany sweats.

191
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,840
Stop where you are
and take off your clothes.

192
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:05,277
It's couples massage.
Ugh. Where's Leslie?

193
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:06,987
Oh, well, she seemed
kind of stressed out.

194
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:08,481
And then she yelled at me,

195
00:08:08,516 --> 00:08:10,090
and she said she was
too busy to come.

196
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,141
And since you had said
do not tell her the secret

197
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:14,928
- under any circumstances...
- Aw, man.

198
00:08:14,963 --> 00:08:17,598
Well, that's a danger of doing
things a day early, I guess.

199
00:08:17,632 --> 00:08:19,199
Should I text her and try again?

200
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:21,357
Why don't you just go ahead
and get your massage,

201
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:23,540
and then hopefully we can
get her in for the next thing.

202
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:25,205
Okay. I have been
kind of tense lately.

203
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,975
Just thinking about
the new Star Wars sequel.

204
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,377
I'm afraid they're gonna
rely too heavily on CGI.

205
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,080
And I'm carrying it all
in my shoulders.

206
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:35,182
Just you? You paid for a couple.

207
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:39,019
Well, can't believe
I'm saying this, but, uh...

208
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,856
Larry, would you like to get
a couples massage with me?

209
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,491
I would love to.

210
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,426
Are we sure we should do this?

211
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:48,695
Last time we scared an old person,
Larry had a heart attack.

212
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,364
That was awesome.
He farted so much.

213
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,159
Okay, look, obviously,
we don't really know

214
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,635
these people, so let's
keep things fun and positive

215
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,471
and celebratory, and merger-y.

216
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,641
Can I help you?

217
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:03,076
Hello, Mrs. DeMarco,
I am Leslie Knope,

218
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:05,045
and we saw your announcement
in the newspaper

219
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,314
and we would love to treat
you and your husband

220
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,583
to a very special day.

221
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,885
All right.
How much money did we win?

222
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,155
Oh, no, you didn't win any money,
you won something better than money.

223
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:17,190
A golden anniversary celebration.

224
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:19,159
So no money.

225
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:23,830
No, and I'm now just realizing
how misleading this giant check it.

226
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:24,831
- Told you.
- Yes, you did, Tom.

227
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:27,834
Thank you. Now is not the time.
We... Hey! Hey!

228
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:29,536
We'll give you some money.
Okay?

229
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,804
Here, here's some money.
Everybody give 'em money.

230
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:34,608
I got football cards,
and a travel mouthwash.

231
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,810
Wow! That's great!

232
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,645
Let's get started!

233
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,614
Just give me
the IP address of the dude

234
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,649
that gave me
that cracked-out Yelp review.

235
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,284
Okay, here we go.

236
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:47,621
The IP address says it came from
someone inside city hall.

237
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:50,223
In this building? Oh, hell, no.

238
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,025
Well, who cares, really?

239
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,827
It's just some dumb
internet person. Ignore it.

240
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,429
Ignore it?

241
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:58,298
I'm about to come down on this
dude like Thor's hammer Mjolnir.

242
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:02,669
I'm about to go Mjolnir
on his ass!

243
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,505
Speaking of bad reviews...

244
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,074
Computers are mostly pointless,
but that Yelp thing

245
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:11,778
gave me a great idea on how to
criticize people and places.

246
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:15,232
I am composing strongly-worded letters

247
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:18,185
about things I disapprove of,
and I am using the internet

248
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:20,987
to get addresses
where I can send them.

249
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:23,457
So far I've written
to a vegetable farm,

250
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:27,961
several European ambassadors,
a manufacturer of male cologne,

251
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:31,531
and a nonfat frozen yogurt bar.

252
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:35,502
"Dear frozen yogurt,
you are the celery of desserts.

253
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:40,507
Be ice cream or be nothing.
Zero stars."

254
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:44,111
Oh, I cannot wait for Leslie
to see this surprise.

255
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,679
I am so prepared.

256
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:48,648
I watched Enchanted three times
to get all the details right.

257
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:52,419
And then another two times,
because that movie is amazing.

258
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:54,020
Oh, it really is.

259
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:56,490
- Hello?
- Oh, hey, Leslie.

260
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:58,158
You want to go grab lunch together?

261
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,361
- I'm out front. Super casual.
- I'm sorry, babe.

262
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:04,197
I'm not even in my office.
I'm out saving the merger.

263
00:11:04,232 --> 00:11:05,766
Can it wait?

264
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,602
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No worries.

265
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:09,870
Okay, great.
I'll see you at dinner. I love you.

266
00:11:09,904 --> 00:11:12,105
Oh, boy.

267
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,541
Well, it's not too late
to cancel the waffle buffet

268
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,842
or the Hilary impersonator,

269
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:18,011
but a lot of these deposits
were non-refundable.

270
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:20,380
Hey, Larry.

271
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:23,917
You up for a boys' day out
in a horse-drawn carriage?

272
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,919
Sure. What the heck?

273
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:28,522
Well, thus begins
our enchanted adventure.

274
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:31,591
God, that movie really was amazing.

275
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,727
And you know what doesn't
get enough credit in that movie?

276
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,028
- The score.
- Music.

277
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:37,064
Good sir,

278
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:38,999
tally ho.

279
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,634
God, that... from the movie!

280
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:42,602
That is definitely from the movie.

281
00:11:42,637 --> 00:11:44,938
Okay, you two, head on up there.

282
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,808
We are gonna recreate your
wedding photo from 50 years ago.

283
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:50,777
Okay, let's relive that day.

284
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:53,714
Only this time could we
shave her moustache?

285
00:11:53,748 --> 00:11:55,382
Oh, boy. I don't know.

286
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,285
I'm kind of worried about
putting these two on live TV.

287
00:11:58,319 --> 00:11:59,953
They're sort of grumpy.

288
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,389
Why are we wasting our time
with these old people anyway?

289
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,990
They're like the old version of iTunes.

290
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:05,892
We're like the new version
of iTunes, baby.

291
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:08,628
We're gonna be here forever.

292
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:11,064
Oh, my God.

293
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:12,632
I'm gonna die someday.

294
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,769
Well, let's just hope that deep down
these two still love each other.

295
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:19,539
Hey, no touching.
This is not your birthday.

296
00:12:19,574 --> 00:12:23,210
Now, you see, the trick with paella
is to use just enough saffron

297
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:25,012
- to complement the shellfish.
- Okay.

298
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,116
- Oh, man, that is so good.
- Oh, yeah.

299
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,751
Wow, isn't this exciting?

300
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,352
In just a few minutes,

301
00:12:32,387 --> 00:12:35,322
you are going to be professing
your love on television.

302
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,157
Could I have a glass of water
before we go on?

303
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:38,291
Don't give him any water.

304
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:39,826
He does this annoying thing
where every time

305
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:42,062
he takes a drink of water
he goes, "Ah..."

306
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,064
She does this annoying thing
where every time

307
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,032
she takes a drink of water
she is an old nag.

308
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:49,970
Ah, the playful banter
of a couple on the same team.

309
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:51,772
That's what this is, right?

310
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:54,107
All right, let's burn this candle.

311
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:55,275
Joan, if we could just have a moment.

312
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,010
We need to get ready.

313
00:12:57,045 --> 00:12:58,645
Oh, no, no. We gotta go.

314
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,013
Yeah, the uppers are kicking in.

315
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:01,715
Just took some ludes
to kind of smooth it out,

316
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,116
so I'm right in that sweet spot.

317
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:06,420
Got about 20 minutes before
I either get really tired

318
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:10,190
or really horny, so let's roll.

319
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,826
Dougie, are you sure
you want to go on television?

320
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,328
You look like a leather glove
got caught in a lawnmower.

321
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:17,798
Okay, you know what?
I'm going to admit something.

322
00:13:17,832 --> 00:13:20,267
I orchestrated
the Pawnee-Eagleton merger,

323
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:24,037
and I was hoping that
your marriage could show people

324
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:25,672
that a happy union is possible.

325
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,908
So when you're out there,
if you could just, you know,

326
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,777
look back over the past
50 years together

327
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:34,514
and focus on the good times, okay?

328
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,050
Donna, you wanted to see me?

329
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,585
Yes, I did, troll.

330
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,053
What?

331
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:41,855
You tried to adopt a cat
last week and I turned you down,

332
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:45,025
because I thought it was too sad
for you to have six cats.

333
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:47,394
Then you tried to blow up
my spot online.

334
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:48,929
You're fired.

335
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:51,665
You're not my boss, I work
for the city attorney's office.

336
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,634
You're fired.

337
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,372
How much postage does it take
to send a letter to Canada?

338
00:13:59,407 --> 00:14:01,808
- Who's it going to?
- Canada.

339
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:05,011
It says, "Dear Canada,
you."

340
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:07,681
Doug and Rosie DeMarco,
50 years.

341
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:08,715
Ahh.

342
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:11,585
Tell us how you first met.

343
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,754
Well, it was 1963,

344
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:17,891
and we met, and it was great.

345
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,826
Isn't love grand?

346
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:24,397
50 years of marriage, helping
to bridge the meaningless divide

347
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:26,199
between Pawnee and Eagleton.

348
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:27,434
Yeah, my show, my questions.

349
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:30,270
So what is the secret sauce
that we should all

350
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:33,573
be putting on
our marriage burgers?

351
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:35,242
Well, we never go to bed angry.

352
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:36,543
Never, ever would have
thought of that.

353
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:39,546
- Ahh.
- Okay.

354
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,615
I can't do this.
Leslie, you can keep your money.

355
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,084
M-money?

356
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:45,752
Did you bribe them to be here?

357
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,020
No, I...

358
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,122
Leslie offered us each
200 bucks to keep this going...

359
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:51,458
- Ah...
- But it's impossible.

360
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,059
You want to know
why we got married?

361
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:54,461
Bring it.

362
00:14:54,495 --> 00:14:57,097
I had no prospects, and Dougie
here had an alcohol problem.

363
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,666
Plus the Cold War was happening,

364
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,935
and frankly, we all thought
we were gonna die.

365
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,404
Well, I figured I could
really tick off my parents

366
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:07,507
by shacking up
with some Pawnee trash.

367
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,975
Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta. Okay.

368
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,578
We all agree that marriages
have their ups and downs,

369
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:16,116
but at the end of the day,
they're worth it because...

370
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,484
Who likes tap dancing?

371
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,849
I slept with Sharon in 1979.

372
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:24,257
I used to get out of the shower
in front of your brother on purpose.

373
00:15:26,435 --> 00:15:29,103
Hey, Leslie, who cares?
They're old people.

374
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,539
They eat, they sleep, they complain,
and they watch Family Feud.

375
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:32,907
Oh, my God,
I wanna be an old person.

376
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:34,642
Gah, I don't know what to do.

377
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:37,111
I wish Ben was here.
What is he doing right now?

378
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:57,264
Oh, man!

379
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:58,832
- You did good!
- Larry!

380
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:01,201
Whoa! Wow. Thank you.

381
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:04,701
Can I help you?

382
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:08,208
Yeah, I own Lettuce Eat,
the vegan restaurant on Lowell Drive,

383
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:10,811
and I wanted to know
why you nailed this letter to my door.

384
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,980
"Veganism is the sad result

385
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,715
"of a morally corrupt mind.

386
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:17,651
Reconsider your life."

387
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,187
Because I believe it. Good day.

388
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:24,057
Carnivores. You're all the same.

389
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:25,993
How did that guy
know where to find you?

390
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,794
I assume he saw
my name and address

391
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:30,197
at the bottom of the letter
I nailed to his door.

392
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,566
- You signed your real name?
- Of course I did.

393
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,700
What's gonna happen?

394
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:35,769
A vegan is gonna physically
attack me?

395
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:38,405
They're basically made of glass.

396
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:40,574
But more importantly,
if you believe in something,

397
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:42,142
you sign your name to it.

398
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:44,878
Which is why the makers
of carbonated water

399
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:47,748
will soon know exactly
where to find me.

400
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:53,520
Donna, Kyle did not
write those things, okay?

401
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,988
I did.

402
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,224
- I know.
- You do?

403
00:16:57,258 --> 00:16:58,692
I checked what else
that user had written.

404
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,661
It was a review
of a funeral home that said

405
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:02,195
"Great first date spot."

406
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,231
I dragged Kyle in here to see
if you would come clean.

407
00:17:04,265 --> 00:17:05,799
Well, you overestimated

408
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,101
how much I care
what happens to Kyle.

409
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:10,237
Or anyone, really.

410
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:13,841
But... I'm sorry that I didn't
just talk to you.

411
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,115
And I'm sorry I bailed on work.

412
00:17:15,143 --> 00:17:18,078
And I'm sorry I toyed with you
instead of coming at you straight.

413
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,647
From now on,
we say what we feel.

414
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,516
- Cool?
- Cool.

415
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,184
Your lipstick looks weird.

416
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:25,719
You're gonna want to
shut your mouth right now.

417
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,621
Good talk.

418
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,222
I don't know.

419
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,626
Maybe Pawneeans and Eagletonians
aren't meant to coexist.

420
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,428
Well, at least our merger
is going well.

421
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:37,664
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

422
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:39,499
You know, Andy and Tom were right

423
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:41,135
when they said
the DeMarcos don't matter.

424
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,803
Their generation's the past.

425
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:44,304
The way to make
this merger take hold

426
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:46,373
is to focus on the future.

427
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,241
Of course.

428
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,411
The children.
The children are our future.

429
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,980
Whitney Houston knew it,

430
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:54,448
and so do you, and so do I.

431
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:55,816
I'm gonna need your help
on something.

432
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,317
- I think we should go to work...
- Oh.

433
00:17:57,352 --> 00:17:59,786
But not now. We're having dinner.

434
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:02,923
Damn, this paella is good.
Did you put saffron in here?

435
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,792
It makes the shellfish
taste delicious.

436
00:18:05,827 --> 00:18:09,396
Yes. Yes, it does.

437
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,431
Okay, the people in this room

438
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,434
are the first members of the
Pawnee-Eagleton Youth Committee.

439
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,536
Now, April says that young people

440
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:17,971
think the word "committee" is lame,

441
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:20,507
so let's just think of this
as a like a super chill,

442
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:21,842
fun e-hangout.

443
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,810
Worse. That's worse.

444
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:25,479
Okay, new people.
Let's introduce ourselves.

445
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:26,813
Craig Middlebrooks.

446
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,949
Samantha in the boardroom,
Miranda in the bedroom.

447
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,585
I know it's not ideal,
but it's who I am.

448
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:34,354
This is my friend Madison.
She's amazing.

449
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:36,256
And she drove me here!

450
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,558
Okay.

451
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:40,460
This group has
an incredibly important job.

452
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,864
You need to figure out how to
hold this town together.

453
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:45,666
You are going to meet twice a week

454
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,467
and you're here
because of your energy,

455
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,536
and your youth, and for some
of you, your mental age,

456
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,205
and you're going to find a way
to make this merger stick.

457
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,174
So we are gonna order you
some 'zzas.

458
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,010
You get to B.S.-ing,
brainstorming.

459
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:59,524
Just chill. Peace out.

460
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:02,480
Okay, so it's been an hour.

461
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:03,848
From out there,
it looks like you guys

462
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,217
were having some fun,
getting to know each other.

463
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:07,171
So why don't we call
this first meeting a success

464
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:08,853
and then we'll get together
later in the week.

465
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,822
Hold up, sweet pea.
We have an idea.

466
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,024
It's called the Unity Concert.

467
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,494
It's a massive music and arts festival
to celebrate the merger.

468
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,463
We get artists and musicians
from both towns

469
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:19,631
to come together.

470
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:20,966
It's gonna be like a giant Woodstock,

471
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,868
except for instead of everybody
rolling around in mud,

472
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,336
they'll be rolling around
in happiness.

473
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,105
Or maybe mud. I don't know.
I can't control the weather.

474
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:28,540
We want to have a bunch
of different band stages.

475
00:19:28,574 --> 00:19:30,508
You know, people will go
to parts of the town

476
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:31,643
they don't usually go to.

477
00:19:31,677 --> 00:19:33,545
Plus, we'll have tents
for art exhibits

478
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,547
and panels, and maybe
a short film festival.

479
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,782
Donna said she might
be able to get Ginuwine.

480
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:39,351
That's given me a reason to live.

481
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:40,952
Yeah, it's not like
everyone's gonna suddenly

482
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:42,921
start holding hands and making out,

483
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:45,257
but we figure, why not
throw a big three-day

484
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,692
outdoor party,
show everyone a good time,

485
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,128
and maybe they'll forget
about this stupid stuff.

486
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:51,563
What do you think?

487
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:53,431
I don't... I don't...

488
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't even...
You know what I mean?

489
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,702
What's wrong with her?
Why is making those noises?

490
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,205
Oh, right, you don't know Leslie.

491
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:03,875
That means she loves it so much
she can't speak.

492
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,745
You guys, that's like...
I don't know... Amazing.

493
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,780
Like... what you do there.

494
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:10,482
Happy anniversary.

495
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:11,816
So I know we agreed on no gifts.

496
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:13,652
- What?
- But I did get you a gift.

497
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:14,920
- No.
- A bunch of them, actually.

498
00:20:14,954 --> 00:20:16,721
I was gonna surprise you
with them yesterday,

499
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:19,558
but they never reached you.

500
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,059
Ahem.

501
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:25,463
Oh, my eff-ing God.

502
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:27,432
You planned all of this for me?

503
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,267
An enchanted carriage?

504
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:30,902
This is amazing.

505
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:34,005
Oh, and your scrapbook
instincts are really good.

506
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,473
I mean, this is a little rough,

507
00:20:35,508 --> 00:20:37,008
but you have a lot of talent here.

508
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:38,376
Oh, I can't believe

509
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:40,278
I actually defeated Leslie Knope
at a gift exchange.

510
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:43,014
- Yes!
- Uh, yeah.

511
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,516
About that.

512
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,785
Happy anniversary.

513
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:52,023
It's the Iron Throne.

514
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:53,859
Ohh! It's the Iron Throne.

515
00:20:53,893 --> 00:20:55,460
Yes, it is.

516
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:58,196
I had a guy at the model store
make a replica.

517
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:01,833
He's a bigger Game of Thrones
fan than you are.

518
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:04,069
Okay, I know I'm making
that dumb surprise face,

519
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:05,537
but I can't help it.

520
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,706
This is the greatest gift
I've ever received, Leslie.

521
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,775
When you play the game of thrones,
you win or you die.

522
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,110
Yes.

523
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:13,478
No.

524
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:14,880
Yes.

525
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:16,147
No!

526
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:17,516
Come here.
Come hither, peasant.

527
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,284
Come here. Who are you?

528
00:21:19,318 --> 00:21:20,819
Our starship is in trouble.

529
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,521
Okay, Leslie, listen.

530
00:21:22,555 --> 00:21:24,385
If you're not... if you don't know
what you're talking about...

531
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:30,257
