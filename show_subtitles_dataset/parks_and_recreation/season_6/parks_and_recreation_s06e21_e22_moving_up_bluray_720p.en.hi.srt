1
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,341
Whoa, Alcatraz.

2
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:41,225
Can't believe Michael Bay
spent a billion dollars

3
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,146
of his own money to
build that for The Rock.

4
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,348
I can't believe you were able
to recite that entire movie

5
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:47,383
from memory on the plane ride.

6
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:48,918
You weren't trying to sleep, were you?

7
00:00:48,953 --> 00:00:50,520
I couldn't tell, 'cause you had
that mask thing over your eyes.

8
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:53,723
This may be the craziest
week of my entire life.

9
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:56,426
I am six days away from the
start of the Unity concert.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,827
I am pregnant with triplets.

11
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:59,295
I am trying to decide

12
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,564
if I should take a job that
will move me away from Pawnee,

13
00:01:01,598 --> 00:01:02,899
and I am speaking

14
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:04,968
at the National Parks
conference in San Francisco.

15
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:06,469
It is gonna be so much fun.

16
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:08,404
Michelle Obama is the keynote speaker,

17
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,839
and you know what they say,

18
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:13,309
"What happens at a
national parks conference...

19
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:17,580
Is compiled and emailed to you
in a PDF the following Monday."

20
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:19,749
We got to find a way to break in there.

21
00:01:19,783 --> 00:01:20,850
They give tours.

22
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:22,418
Yeah.

23
00:01:22,453 --> 00:01:25,521
That's exactly how they'll be
expecting me to try to break in.

25
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:47,877
My restaurant opens in six weeks,

26
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:49,913
and I'm making sure I
get every detail right.

27
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:54,551
This is the hardest I've
worked on anything since...

28
00:01:54,585 --> 00:01:56,786
Wow. I've never worked hard on anything.

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,388
What a cool life!

30
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,957
Looks like everything's on track for July.

31
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,725
It's just too bad we're not opening

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
in time for this Unity concert.

33
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:07,297
The extra publicity would've
given us a nice boost.

34
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:09,899
Why don't we? We could
do a soft opening tomorrow

35
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:12,435
and be ready just in time
for the concert crowd.

36
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:14,237
You really think you can pull that off?

37
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:16,439
Well, nobody can predict the future...

38
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:18,274
except me. I guarantee it'll work

39
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:20,810
and in six months, this place
will be bigger than McDonald's.

40
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:23,780
As always, I love your enthusiasm.

41
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:26,015
See you tomorrow, partner.

42
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,984
A soft opening tomorrow?

43
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,186
From now on, everyone call me Kristin,

44
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:31,921
because I am wigging out right now!

45
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:34,190
Yeah, we're not even close to being ready.

46
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:35,525
They're not even done painting that sign.

47
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:37,393
It says, "Tom's Bi."

48
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:39,629
Actually, no, that's good. We're ready.

49
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:41,264
Mitch is right. The amount of buzz we get

50
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:43,433
from opening next weekend
is too big to pass up.

51
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,734
We can do it.

52
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:46,102
"This little Italian restaurant

53
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:47,504
will put McDonald's out
of business" on three.

54
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:49,072
One, two, three.

55
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:50,573
- Dark Lord rise...
- This little Italian restaurant

56
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:52,875
- will be bigger than McDonald's!
- In hell fire.

57
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:59,315
"Lester Kanopf"? Come
on, guys, get it together.

58
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,583
That's mine.

59
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:03,753
- Sorry, Lester.
- Yours is right here.

60
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:05,788
Grant, hi.

61
00:03:05,823 --> 00:03:07,323
Yeah, I saw you were gonna be here,

62
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:09,058
and since you've been ducking my calls,

63
00:03:09,093 --> 00:03:10,293
I just thought that I'd drop in.

64
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:12,428
- Care to join me for lunch?
- I... I would...

65
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:14,063
Liam Bonneville's gonna be there.

66
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:15,999
Liam Bonneville...

67
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:18,201
the department of the
interior's resident bad boy?

68
00:03:18,235 --> 00:03:19,802
Well, now you've got my attention.

69
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,071
Let me go grab my autograph
book, and we'll head out.

70
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:25,108
Andy and I are meeting with a
tech company called "Gryzzl."

71
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:27,177
Now, they're giving away free wi-fi

72
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,645
to a few cities across America,

73
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,513
and we're going to pitch Pawnee to them.

74
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:32,248
And what exactly does Gryzzl do?

75
00:03:32,283 --> 00:03:36,286
Well, "It's the cloud for your cloud."

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,554
No idea.

77
00:03:37,588 --> 00:03:40,256
Wow. So Gryzzl's really taken off, huh?

78
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,925
Uh, yeah, it's been a crazy ride.

79
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,826
Our music service, Gryzzldump,
launched in November,

80
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,995
and now we have 170 million users.

81
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,731
Six months ago, I was
working in a taco truck.

82
00:03:48,766 --> 00:03:52,669
Now I own one-third of
the Portland trail blazers.

83
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,438
You know, I think Pawnee
is a great candidate

84
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:56,840
for your free-wireless initiative.

85
00:03:56,874 --> 00:03:59,542
We lead the country in
online pizza ordering.

86
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:01,744
In fact, a lot of people go to the library

87
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,479
just to order pizza online.

88
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:06,449
Right now we're kind of
focused on, like, bigger cities,

89
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:08,284
like Shreveport, Akron.

90
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,119
Sure. Obviously, we're no Akron.

91
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:11,487
I mean, we're more like Dayton.

92
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:15,492
But with your help, we can become Toledo.

93
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:19,429
Ben, we don't like to say the word "no"...

94
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,364
- No.
- At this company.

95
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:24,834
We feel it's counterproductive
to our creative mission,

96
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:28,304
so, instead, let me say...

97
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,572
"Nah, bro."

98
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:31,474
How is that better?

99
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,977
Dwayne "the Rock" Swanson.

100
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,378
Donna told me I'd find you up here.

101
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:37,413
- What's all this?
- Over the last few months,

102
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:39,816
I've remodeled the entire third floor...

103
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,584
wiring, heating and cooling,

104
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:44,521
restored this red pine
back to its original glory.

105
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:47,156
Oh, wow. The stripes are so wavy.

106
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:48,424
It's really...

107
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,093
all right, I can't keep
this facade up any longer.

108
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,461
I need a favor. You know those chairs

109
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:52,695
you were making for my restaurant?

110
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,798
- I need 'em now.
- I was told I had until July.

111
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,600
My chairs take time.

112
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:59,536
Who do you think I am, Thomas Hucker?

113
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:02,639
Please, Ron?

114
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:04,474
I've never asked you for anything today.

115
00:05:04,508 --> 00:05:06,543
All right. I'll get to work right away.

116
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:08,945
Please, you're really far behind.

117
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,948
Hello, everybody. This is Leslie Knope.

118
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:14,684
- Leslie, this is Rebecca...
- Varuvian, yes, hello.

119
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:16,619
I ow who you are. I've
read all of your papers

120
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:19,255
and I had your poster on
my wall when I was a kid.

121
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,491
- What poster?
- I made a poster of you

122
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:24,194
by blowing up your picture from
the national parks newsletter.

123
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:25,795
I cut out your face and made it look

124
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,510
like you were dunking over Charles Barkley.

125
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:30,266
- My God.
- So you're the author

126
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:32,802
of the famous river cleanup proposal, huh?

127
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:34,771
It wasn't bad.

128
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:36,806
Liam Bonneville read my proposal. Wow.

129
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:39,275
Liam's being withholding, as usual.

130
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,511
That proposal was brilliantly written.

131
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:43,179
Rebecca Varuvian.

132
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:44,948
- Yes?
- Nothing.

133
00:05:44,982 --> 00:05:47,951
That was the best lunch I ever had.

134
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:49,986
I have to see the photos that you took.

135
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,922
- I didn't take any photos.
- What? Grant, come on.

136
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:55,477
Leslie, you're treating those
people like they're your heroes.

137
00:05:55,493 --> 00:05:56,559
They could be your peers.

138
00:05:56,594 --> 00:05:58,261
Look, I really hope you take the job,

139
00:05:58,295 --> 00:05:59,629
but we're at the end of the line here.

140
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:02,632
- I need a decision by tomorrow.
- Okay, that's fair.

141
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,235
I mean, I would be insane
not to take the job,

142
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:08,471
but I'm just having some trouble
thinking about leaving Pawnee.

143
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,573
Hey, here's someone who
may be able to convince you.

144
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:12,175
Hello, Mrs. Obama.

145
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,776
- Hey, Grant. How you doing?
- Oh.

146
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:15,578
Doing good.

147
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:16,946
This is Leslie Knope.

148
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:18,114
She's considering a job with us

149
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,016
running the new Midwest Bureau in Chicago.

150
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,218
Well, you know how I feel about Chicago.

151
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:24,220
Ah, you are from Chicago, so you like it!

152
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,357
That's right, and we need
passionate people like you

153
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:28,791
on our national parks.

154
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:31,728
You know, they get hundreds of
millions of visitors each year.

155
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,797
Are you nodding because you agree with me?

156
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,265
Yes, I do agree with you.

157
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:36,866
I agree with you on all things

158
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:39,569
throughout history until
the end of time, forever.

159
00:06:39,603 --> 00:06:41,938
- You and Grant work together?
- Yeah, we work together a lot.

160
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:44,107
He's helped me integrate
the "Let's Move" program

161
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:45,408
into our national parks...

162
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:48,678
you know, getting kids
outside, rock climbing, hiking.

163
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:50,613
Wow! That's really, really
incredible! Great work!

164
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,081
I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!

165
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,117
I'm getting louder now, and
I can't stop! My apologies!

166
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,086
Just... I don't know. I'm
sorry I'm talking so loud!

167
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:59,789
- Just... can I high-five you?
- Yeah. Well...

168
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:01,124
I hope you take the job.

169
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:05,028
Change happens one person at a time.

170
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:07,564
Good to meet you.

171
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,702
Again, think it over.

172
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:24,805
- Okay, this is a bad idea.
- Just trust me.

173
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:26,125
You got your camera ready?

174
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,260
Yeah, Andy, I'm very nervous about this.

175
00:07:28,295 --> 00:07:30,362
You're gonna hurt yourself.

176
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:31,730
And here we go.

177
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:38,003
Wow! Look at it go!

178
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,005
I mean, I knew it'd go
down, but not that fast!

179
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,241
Oh-ho! San Francisco's the best.

180
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:44,944
Huh.

181
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:46,645
I thought he was go.

182
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,714
Yeah. Anyway...

183
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,649
I've decided. I'm gonna take the job.

184
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:53,252
There's so much more th,

185
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,020
and I feel like I can
really make a difference.

186
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:56,355
Oh, and I met Michelle Obama.

187
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,894
What? Why didn't you lead with that?

188
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,816
I don't know! Liam
Boneville has me in a tizzy.

189
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:04,697
Guys! It's totally broken!

190
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,066
We have ten tables booked
for the soft opening.

191
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,221
It's all friends and family,

192
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:09,668
so hopefully they'll go easy on us.

193
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:11,670
How's it looking, Ron?
Maybe speed it up a little?

194
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:13,272
This is not government work.

195
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,674
As such, I treat it
with care and attention.

196
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,843
Okay, but also, go faster.

197
00:08:17,878 --> 00:08:19,545
I haven't had time to hire a staff yet,

198
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:21,914
so, April, you'll handle service.

199
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,749
No! Can't I just stay in the back

200
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,951
and spit in people's food like we planned?

201
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:27,653
Ugh!

202
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,755
The sawdust from Ron's
chairs is everywhere!

203
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:31,056
My sinuses are on the Fritz,

204
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,792
and smell is 90% of taste, maybe 95%!

205
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,562
Okay, Craig, Donna's
gonna be your wine taster.

206
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:37,763
You guys will work as a team.

207
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:40,232
Fine, but if he raises his voice once...

208
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,001
once... I'm out.

209
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:43,669
Please don't stick to that policy.

210
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:45,204
- I got the menus.
- Great.

211
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,541
Larry, what the hell?
What are these pictures?

212
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:50,676
Aw, jeez, I must have given the printer

213
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,844
the wrong flash drive.

214
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:53,913
What is this, a rotten grapefruit?

215
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:56,382
No, it's my dog's rectum.

216
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,516
Lord Sheldon has a growth,

217
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:59,685
so we're sending pictures over to the vet.

218
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,287
But I guess this isn't
good for menus, is it?

219
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:04,924
Larry, Larry, Larry, listen to me.

220
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,327
This is the worst thing you've ever done.

221
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:11,297
I need you to take all
of these dog-butt pictures

222
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,465
and burn them in the pizza oven.

223
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:15,100
April, you list all the
menu items from memory.

224
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:16,635
It'll be classier anyway.

225
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,370
Ron! What was wrong with that one?

226
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:21,340
It was too perfect.
It looked machine-made.

227
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,711
Okay, we have to convince 'em
that Pawnee is a special city.

228
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:27,780
Ooh, we could tell 'em
that there's buried treasure

229
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:30,015
in Pawnee.

230
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,884
And then after they
give us the free wi-fi,

231
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:34,119
we tell 'em that the
treasure was love all along.

232
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:35,154
No.

233
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:36,956
I am not gonna take "no" for an answer.

234
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,224
If we're leaving Pawnee,

235
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:39,892
I'm gonna give 'em a going-away present...

236
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:42,161
free wi-fi for all.

237
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:45,097
Every time someone in Pawnee
clicks through a slideshow

238
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,867
of American music award
red-carpet side-boob fails,

239
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:51,770
they'll say, "Thank you, Ben Wyatt."

240
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:54,440
What the hell?

241
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,408
They're playing Cones of Dunshire.

242
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:58,110
Hey, you invented that game.

243
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:00,212
Are they playing any games I invented?

244
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:01,647
Are they throwing dirt into a fan?

245
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:02,948
The key is, you have to throw the dirt

246
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:04,784
- into the back of the fan.
- How the hell did they...

247
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:08,721
Excuse me. How did you guys
get your hands on this game?

248
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:10,790
Someone sent it to us. Have you played it?

249
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,525
I invented Cones of Dunshire.

250
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,893
You're the architect.

251
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,662
Yeah, right, and I'm the
Alchemist of the Hinterlands.

252
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,399
There can't be an Alchemist
of the Hinterlands.

253
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,801
The Hinterlands is a Shadongdom

254
00:10:21,835 --> 00:10:24,403
that can only sustain
a provost or a denier.

255
00:10:24,438 --> 00:10:27,206
- He's right.
- Hey, how about this?

256
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,307
Let's play.

257
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:30,276
If I win, you give me another shot

258
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,844
at free wireless for Pawnee.

259
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:35,081
Have a seat. You want to be corporal...

260
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:38,317
- or warrior?
- Neither.

261
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,253
I'm the Maverick.

262
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:44,623
By using the Leslie Knope
seamless merger supesystem...

263
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:46,926
patent pending... Pawnee and Eagleton

264
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,728
and their parks departments
will be fully integrated

265
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:52,064
within the next 6 to 12 months.

266
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,699
I know, I know.

267
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,468
I think it was a good presentation too.

268
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:56,535
Is that why you're laughing?

269
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,170
Your timeline is way off.

270
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:02,541
I was in charge of the
Wesham/Southborough merger of 2004.

271
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:05,411
You know when it was completed? Last month.

272
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:06,879
What? How is that possible?

273
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:10,316
Merging governments requires
constant hands-on management.

274
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,385
You're being very cavalier
about the future of your town.

275
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,300
Excuse me. I've been
accused of lot of things,

276
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:16,922
but cavalier has never been one of them.

277
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:18,891
I have a super system.

278
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:22,828
I had a system too, but
the economy went South.

279
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:26,198
My hometown hit some hard times

280
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:30,469
and was converted into
unincorporated territory.

281
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:32,238
You lost your cityhood?

282
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:33,539
If you want to see this through,

283
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:35,941
you need eight to ten years minimum,

284
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:38,577
unless you want to run the
risk of Pawnee becoming...

285
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:42,748
- Don't say it.
- Unincorporated territory.

286
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:48,454
It's a bold flavor...
fruity, a little earthy.

287
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:50,289
Well, which is it... fruity or earthy?

288
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:52,792
It can't be both. They're
mutually exclusive!

289
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:55,361
Oh, no! You do not come at me like that.

290
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:57,263
I'm sorry. I don't know who I am anymore.

291
00:11:57,297 --> 00:11:59,165
A man without a palate isn't a man.

292
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:00,833
I love you, Donna.

293
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,234
What are you guys doing?

294
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,003
There's people waiting out there!

295
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,477
We're having a moment, you monster!

296
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:07,306
Ugh!

297
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,675
- Stop hassling me.
- Ron, you're amazing.

298
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,043
You've always been like a grandpa to me,

299
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:13,879
but can you please lower
your standards a tiny bit

300
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:16,916
so my customers have somewhere to sit?

301
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,417
No.

302
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:20,353
Oh!

303
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:21,987
I am so sorry, Tom.

304
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:23,189
I can't believe I'm saying this,

305
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,256
but don't worry about it.

306
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,624
Restaurant superstition...

307
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,194
breaking a glass on the
first night is good luck.

308
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:30,196
Oh, thank God.

309
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:35,701
Oh, jeez.

310
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:40,940
Play an action card,

311
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:43,609
build a bell tower inside your citadel.

312
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:47,346
My shaman casts a toyber
spell on your prosperity tile.

313
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:50,716
Looks like someone's out of resource gems.

314
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,752
Uh-oh.

315
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,000
What's so funny?

316
00:13:08,034 --> 00:13:09,835
Oh, no, no, no, you're a smart guy,

317
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,371
clearly picked up some flashy tricks,

318
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:14,306
but you made one crucial mistake.

319
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:18,177
You forgot about the essence of the game.

320
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,713
It's about the Cones.

321
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:27,066
Move my abbot to the ocean hex,

322
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:29,288
which moves my Brinksman
to the Devil's Lair,

323
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:33,192
and pushes my farmer...
yes, my humble farmer...

324
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:36,232
directly into the central cone.

325
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,219
Yeah, babe, we did it.

326
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,278
This whole company is ours.

327
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:47,513
Oh, no, it's not.

328
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:49,325
- That's mine, it's all mine.
- Andy...

329
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,329
for the record, I did invent this game.

330
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,934
But it doesn't even matter, because I won

331
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:58,832
and I get another chance to prove that
there's something truly special about Pawnee.

332
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:03,751
Yes, there is. It's the home
of the architect. Let's talk.

333
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:05,327
I'm on top of the world.

334
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,096
Andy, what are you doing?

335
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:09,454
Seems like things are a little chaotic.

336
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:10,980
No, no, everything is perfect.

337
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,901
This is April. She's gonna
be taking care of you tonight.

338
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,833
Hello, welcome to Tommy's Bistro.

339
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:19,192
Today we have spaghetti, linguini,
butercini, ravioli, rigattoni, lasagna.

340
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:20,393
Could you repeat that?

341
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:25,180
Spaghetti, linguini, butercini, ravioli,
Ferrari, Lamborghini, rigattoni, lasagna.

342
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,823
Can I see a menu?

343
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:29,381
We had to throw our menus away because

344
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,195
they are covered with
pictures of Larry's dog rectum.

345
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,972
Great news. Lord Sheldon's
gonna make it. Yeah,

346
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:38,372
just have to apply a salve to his anus
every hour for the rest of his life, but...

347
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:40,192
Oh, enjoy your meal.

348
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,480
- For crying out loud!
- No, Mitch, don't leave. Come on.

349
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,877
You have no idea how to run a restaurant.

350
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:48,932
I've been in this game before and I
can see the cracks starting to form.

351
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:53,436
Sorry, kid, consider my
investment terminated. D, let's go.

352
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:57,411
- Sir, were you sitting in that chair?
- Yes, yes I was. Why?

353
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,551
- No reason.
- Let's go!

354
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:06,996
Apparently, and I don't know
how, but the game has spread.

355
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,577
I mean, it's all over the Internet...

356
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:10,545
Austin, Charlotte, San Diego.

357
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,280
I mean, people are playing
with my Cones, babe.

358
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:13,482
That's great.

359
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:16,017
I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.

360
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:18,386
Oh, I'll look into that,
but at least because of it,

361
00:15:18,421 --> 00:15:21,056
Pawnee will get free wireless,
and we can both move away

362
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,025
with a clear conscience.

363
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,094
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

364
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:29,598
I... I can't leave Pawnee
during a difficult merger

365
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:31,700
that I'm responsible for.

366
00:15:31,734 --> 00:15:33,235
I have to turn down the job.

367
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:36,404
Leslie, no. You made
up your mind yesterday.

368
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:38,607
You... Michelle Obama.

369
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:40,475
I know, but I've been
doing this for months.

370
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:43,044
The only thing that I am 100% positive on

371
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,046
is that I want to stay and go.

372
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:47,015
I'm never gonna be able to decide.

373
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,717
I'm gonna be paralyzed by hypotheticals

374
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:50,986
until I die here, in this minivan...

375
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,054
at the San Francisco airport.

376
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:55,257
Wait a second. I have an idea.

377
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,861
Drive here.

378
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:02,597
So you screwed up a little.

379
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,267
You tried to shoot the
moon, and you came up short.

380
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:07,235
That doesn't mean it's over.

381
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,237
My main investor pulled out.

382
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:11,907
Any dollar I spend from now on is my own.

383
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:14,242
And despite what my pocket square says,

384
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:17,112
I'm not a billionaire.

385
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:19,448
So I quit.

386
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:20,715
Just go home, Ron.

387
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,751
I'm not done with the chairs yet.

388
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:25,320
It is my belief that you never start a job

389
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:26,722
you don't intend to finish.

390
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,423
Really? I love quitting.

391
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:30,659
When I was a kid and
things didn't go my way,

392
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:32,327
I would just take my ball and go home.

393
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,595
That's better than winning,

394
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:35,430
'cause then your friends
can't play anymore.

395
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:36,531
Hey!

396
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:39,134
- No, my stemware!
- You are not quitting.

397
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,936
I just called a bunch of reviewers,

398
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,972
and I told them that the
soft opening went great,

399
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:45,974
and I invited them to come here on Friday.

400
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:48,443
- Why would you do this to me?
- You worked really hard.

401
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:50,779
You owe it to yourself
to give it a real shot,

402
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,581
because you are smart and talented.

403
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:56,551
Well, I hate doing work,
but I love being flattered,

404
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:59,087
so maybe I'll give it another try.

405
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,089
- Good.
- It's a smart move, son.

406
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:03,425
- Thanks, Ron.
- Because you currently owe me

407
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,861
$16,000 for the wood.

408
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:07,162
What?

409
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:11,700
- Where are we going?
- Oh, it's right up here.

410
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:15,003
Just trust me.

411
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:17,839
I'm on Endor.

412
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:20,108
These are the redwoods George Lucas used

413
00:17:20,143 --> 00:17:22,611
to create the forest moon of Endor.

414
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:24,913
Sorry. That's not why we're here.

415
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:30,218
Well, that is a gorgeous view.

416
00:17:30,253 --> 00:17:32,854
Yes, it is.

417
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:34,689
But don't look at that. Look at this.

418
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:38,193
You've been thinking about
this job in the abstract.

419
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:41,163
Focus on what it actually means.

420
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:43,932
We're standing in a national park

421
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,001
that stretches 50 miles.

422
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:48,437
That's the Presidio over
there. It's a national park.

423
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:49,805
So is Alcatraz,

424
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,107
and so are the redwoods we
just walked through, by the way.

425
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:53,575
You take this job,

426
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:57,179
places like this will be your office.

427
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:58,980
Well, that is a compelling point.

428
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:01,583
When we got back from London, you said...

429
00:18:01,617 --> 00:18:04,853
that it's a very big world and
you've seen very little of it.

430
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,922
This is your chance, honey.

431
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:11,026
This whole region... Mount
Rushmore, the Badlands,

432
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,595
the Ozarks, Abe Lincoln's childhood home...

433
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,630
you would be in charge of all of it.

434
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:18,200
Your job would be to preserve

435
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:19,935
the most beautiful places on earth

436
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:22,471
so millions of people could enjoy them.

437
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:26,975
And those places, the greatest
treasures America has to offer,

438
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,445
will all have signs with your name...

439
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,248
right there.

440
00:18:35,852 --> 00:18:39,087
Hi, Grant. I want the job.

441
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:41,156
I have a lot of questions,

442
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,524
but I'm a little amped up right now,

443
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,859
so I'll probably just hang up.

444
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:45,994
It might be for the best.
But, anyway, I love you.

445
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:48,730
No, I don't. I'm sorry.
That was weird. Okay, bye.

446
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:51,366
Oh, this is Lester Kanopf.
No, you know who it...

447
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,702
- Okay, bye.
- Smoothly handled, Lester.

448
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:55,403
I panicked.

449
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:58,740
We should go. We have
a lot of stuff to do...

450
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:00,976
and the meter's still running
on that cab, so chop-chop.

451
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,977
- Really?
- Yeah.

452
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:03,510
Oh.

453
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:08,077
The opening of Tom's Bistro was a disaster.

454
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,789
So what?

455
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:10,831
This is America.

456
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:12,962
And America's the land of second chances,

457
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,134
and now we have one night,

458
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:16,796
one after-party...

459
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:20,176
to make the world realize that Tom's Bistro

460
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:22,395
is where miracles can happen!

461
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,402
Thomas, I have to work all
day at the Unity concert.

462
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:28,468
If you're gonna pull this
off, we need more people.

463
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:31,238
I know, and I didn't want to do this,
but I called in some reinforcements.

464
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:34,344
Did someone call for a party zoo?

465
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,240
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

466
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,640
All right, so we got a
four-way going with my ex,

467
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,019
my brother, and this rando?

468
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,365
Okay, if that's where the night is going...

469
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:43,121
- It's 9:00 in the morning...
- Wha...

470
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:44,983
It's not a four-way.

471
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:46,858
And I need your help.

472
00:19:47,204 --> 00:19:48,779
Take these V.I.P. invitations.

473
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:50,729
Find all the "A" -list
peeps at the concert

474
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:52,300
and get 'em to the restaurant tonight.

475
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:53,955
I got to stop by the Parks office.

476
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:55,331
I'll meet you later. Godspeed.

477
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:57,523
I like your energy, hombre.

478
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:59,152
What do you say you and
I ride go-karts later?

479
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:01,045
I want to go horseback riding!

480
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:02,538
Deal.

481
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:05,445
Last chance, Ron.

482
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:08,114
The slots are finalized, but
I can squeeze in ten minutes

483
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,177
if a certain mister...

484
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:11,596
Duke Silver wanted to come out.

485
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:13,241
Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun.

486
00:20:13,315 --> 00:20:15,562
Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not,

487
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:18,524
playing music is something
I like to keep private,

488
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:20,762
along with my family, my conversations,

489
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:22,643
and my whereabouts at all times.

490
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:27,971
Okay, everyone, welcome to the very
last Unity concert planning meeting.

491
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:30,761
Andy, you are in charge. This
is your show. Take it away.

492
00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:34,298
Your mission, should
you choose to accept it,

493
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,525
is to accept the following missions.

494
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,307
- Madison.
- Manning that art tents.

495
00:20:39,427 --> 00:20:41,643
- Donna.
- Scheduling... and security liaison.

496
00:20:41,763 --> 00:20:43,901
- Larry.
- Staying out of the way.

497
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:45,795
And all of the rest of the
volunteer-work assignments

498
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:47,517
are up on this board.

499
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:51,942
Your main goal today is to
get 2,000 people to sign up

500
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:55,558
for the Pawnee-Eagleton
merger preservation

501
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,819
volunteer action squad.

502
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,970
Their first project will be to come up

503
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:01,371
with a shorter name for the group.

504
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,491
You're right. The name is too
long. I was picturing bigger hats.

505
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:08,458
- All right, here we go.
- Everybody, let's get to work.

506
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,214
Can the Parks and Rec people
hang back for a second?

507
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:15,342
Um...

508
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:21,104
The reason I wanted you guys to stick
around is, I wanted to tell you...

509
00:21:21,695 --> 00:21:24,990
- That I love and admire you.
- Oh! Leslie, thank you.

510
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,846
You say that every morning.

511
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:30,595
A while ago, I was offered a job
at the national parks service,

512
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:34,344
and it's a great opportunity, but
it means that I'll have to move...

513
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:35,583
to Illinois.

514
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,068
And I took the job.

515
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,431
- Good for you!
- Wow!

516
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,046
- That's great!
- Congratulations, Knope.

517
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,606
The sentimental people in this office

518
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:44,872
will probably miss you.

519
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:47,502
- When do you leave?
- Soon, maybe a month.

520
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,401
Oh. That makes what we're about to show you

521
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,370
a little bit awkward.

522
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:55,606
We had a new founders
day statue commissioned

523
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:58,076
and added your name to the
list of founders of Pawnee.

524
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,012
Because you basically
founded this new town.

525
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:03,948
Leslie Knope, champion of
the Pawnee-Eagleton merger,

526
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:05,383
"our most faithful citizen.

527
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:07,185
She never abandoned us."

528
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:09,287
- Oh, boy.
- There's a quote too.

529
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:11,422
"'Only a moron would ever live anywhere

530
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:12,757
other than Pawnee, Indiana.'

531
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,659
Leslie Knope, multiple occasions."

532
00:22:14,693 --> 00:22:17,695
I can cut a new plinth with
a less ironic inscription.

533
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,570
This is so touching, you guys.

534
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:23,067
I am crying out of happiness
and sadness and gratitude

535
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:24,535
and because I'm carrying triplets

536
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,437
and for a fifth reason
that I can't figure out.

537
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,339
Leslie, don't cry. It's not that great.

538
00:22:28,373 --> 00:22:30,975
It doesn't even look like you.
Or, actually, you know what?

539
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:33,044
It kind of does.

540
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:35,012
Well, it's about that time.

541
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:36,481
Unity concert!

542
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:45,456
Hello, Pawnee. We're The Decembrists.

543
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,129
It's great to be here
in support of this event.

544
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,930
This is truly an amazing town.

545
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:57,602

said it was the first time
he ever had to do that.

558
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:38,276

Don't... just let me talk...

563
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:52,323
Well, the relocation package seems fair,

564
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:55,159
but the dental plan is more than fair.

565
00:23:55,194 --> 00:23:57,795
I mean, three annual cleanings
for the spouse? Ka-ching.

566
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,263

this concert blows, right?

571
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,505
You guys really want to see a crowd,

00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:10,541

- Yeah.

00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:15,747
There's a cover band around here...

00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:17,181
they call themselves "Cherry Pie."

577
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:18,816

Okay, uh, let's talk staff.

For the first few months,

you're only gonna have six staffers.

587
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:39,604
Four of them will be coming up from Omaha.

588
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:42,106
Oh, so does that mean that
there's two openings left?

589
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:43,808

took away your rubber duckies.

616
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:04,226
Really consider it.

617
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,882
How would you feel about leaving
Pawnee and moving to Chicago?

618
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,607
Hold on, come on, I'm not done.

619
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:12,581
You'd be working for
the federal government.

It's very sweet, Leslie,

624
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:25,492

the only branch of government worth a damn,

00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:29,284
but Diane and I are quite
happy raising our family here.

626
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:31,516
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there's a booth over there

"fried sausage quilts,"

628
00:26:34,463 --> 00:26:36,876

663
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:14,375
things ended so weird with mouse rat.

664
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:15,843
You know, that's not
really how I pictured us

665
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:18,279
- breaking up, you know.
- Yeah, I do know.

666
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,033
I always figured we'd...
you know, whatever...

667
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:21,982
break up 'cause I got drafted by the Colts.

668
00:28:22,017 --> 00:28:25,152
And then in the first game,
of course, I'd break my leg.

669
00:28:25,187 --> 00:28:28,689
Crowd starts chanting my name,
and I give 'em the thumbs-up.

670
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:31,092
And then I'd go to the hospital.
I'd get really good at chess.

671
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,127
I end up beating the computer finally,

672
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,529
and then the band just
sort of drifts apart.

673
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:36,997
- That was how I saw it, but...
- Yeah.

674
00:28:37,032 --> 00:28:40,067
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, see you.

675
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:42,236
Babe, that was so awesome.

676
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,704
That was the best performance ever.

677
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:46,006
One kid peed his pants because
he didn't want to miss anything.

678
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:48,009
- What? I gave a kid pee pants?
- Yes!

I hope you like deep-dish pizza,

697
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,167
because there's gonna be a
lot more of it in Chicago,

698
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,869
where we're all gonna be moving.

699
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:50,805
- Okay.
- No. No.

700
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:54,041
We are not moving to Chicago
for, like, a billion reasons.

701
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:57,194
- But, babe, pizza.
- There's pizza in Pawnee.

702
00:29:57,314 --> 00:29:59,048
Right. Thanks, babe.

703
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,884
You're so good at
reminding me where pizza is.

704
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:02,752
Come on, guys, take a risk.

705
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:04,988
Live on the edge. Life is an adventure.

- No.

708
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:10,460
Pawnee is cheap, and we like it here,

709
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:14,364
and Chicago seems like there's
a lot of stuff to do and people,

710
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,332
but I like to do nothing with no one.

711
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,401

all been waiting for.

This next band agreed to
reunite for one night only,

725
00:31:11,188 --> 00:31:12,455
and it's gonna be great.

they play Summer Sun.

No, I mean, I love that
I'm Johnny Karate now,

I love this town so much,

and I'm just so proud to live here.

00:32:44,014 --> 00:32:47,183

767
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:37,050
which means it's the most
important night of your lives too.

768
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,229
Speak for yourself. I once got into a cab

769
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,870
that Kyra Sedgwick was getting out of.

770
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,414
No way, The Closer? Oof!

771
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:45,303

775
00:34:52,472 --> 00:34:54,718
Your father ruined my last business.
Why would you bring him here?

776
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:56,827
Because you told me to look for V.I.P.s,

777
00:34:56,947 --> 00:35:00,671
and my daddy is the V.I.-est "P" I know.

778
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,099
- I love you, daddy.
- I love you too, angel.

Money, please.

780
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:07,393

- Money, please!

781
00:35:07,394 --> 00:35:08,394
Craig, we're gonna drink.

782
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:10,525
Why would you come here, Saperstein?

783
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:13,652
I came here to see your
flourishing business,

784
00:35:13,772 --> 00:35:15,097
to see how well you're doing.

785
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:17,529
Wow! You're back.

786
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:20,243
Can you squeeze me in, or
do I need a reservation?

787
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,097
'Cause there's nobody here.

788
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:26,860
Maybe this restaurant
won't be a huge success.

789
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,284
Maybe it won't be packed with celebrities.

790
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:31,481
- Tommy!
- Or maybe it will.

791
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:33,493
- Hello, Joan. Hello, Perd.
- Hi.

792
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:35,359
Thanks for coming by.

793
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,891
- Can I get you a drink?
- I'll have the Joan.

794
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:41,890
It's a tumbler of gin, and it's
got crushed aspirin around the rim.

795
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,906
And I would just like an empty glass.

796
00:35:44,216 --> 00:35:46,756
Steve, can we get these
cocktails going for Joan and Perd?

797
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:50,014
Oh, look, Kay Hanley, rock
star, thanks for coming by.

798
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:51,138
Thanks for having me.

799
00:35:51,258 --> 00:35:53,797
Come on in, guys. You
might want to grab a seat,

800
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:56,384
Dr. Saperstein. Looks like it's getting...

801
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:58,318
a little crowded.

802
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:07,274
And I said, "you don't need a
towel. You need a washcloth."

803
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:13,758
You know, I don't think that
the girls have ever been happier

804
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:16,625
or more surprised than when
you got up on that stage.

805
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,428
Well, having you and the kids in my life

806
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:20,997
has made me a different person.

807
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:26,878
And I like it. There's more
room in my life for... fun.

808
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:33,162
Hi, Ben.

809
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:35,340
It's me, Barney, from the accounting firm.

810
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,749
Yes. Hi, Barney. You don't have
to introduce yourself every time.

811
00:36:38,984 --> 00:36:40,312
I was gonna wait until your birthday

812
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:42,578
to give this to you,
but I'm just too excited.

813
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,138
This is the copyright to Cones of Dunshire.

814
00:36:46,364 --> 00:36:48,999
After you gave it to us as
a gift, we saw its potential,

815
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:52,669
so we formed a "C" corp and
registered it in your name.

816
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:55,873
This is amazing. How can I ever repay you?

817
00:36:55,907 --> 00:36:58,475
Come work for us at the accounting firm.

818
00:36:58,509 --> 00:36:59,643
Okay.

819
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:01,378
Oh! Oh!

820
00:37:01,412 --> 00:37:03,480
No, sorry. I can't.

821
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:06,183
Wow. Shortest one yet.

822
00:37:06,217 --> 00:37:08,952
Thank you.

823
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:09,987
Babe, thank you so much

824
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:11,922
for organizing the mouse rat reunion.

825
00:37:11,956 --> 00:37:15,025
It was actually Ginuwine
who arranged everything.

826
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:16,693
He really cares about you.

827
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:18,562
You're the greatest wife ever.

828
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:20,631
I wish I could marry you all over again.

829
00:37:20,665 --> 00:37:22,165
Let's get divorced.

830
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,500
That way, we can get married again.

831
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:24,568
Yes, let's do it.

832
00:37:24,602 --> 00:37:25,636
- You want to?
- Yes!

833
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,870
We should do that, right?

834
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:27,971
Yeah, totally.

835
00:37:28,006 --> 00:37:30,173
- We're getting divorced!
- Yes.

836
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,608
This is amazing.

837
00:37:31,643 --> 00:37:33,343
Practically everyone we invited came,

838
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,646
except for Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus.

839
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,914
I was hoping tonight
would be magical enough

840
00:37:36,948 --> 00:37:38,882
- to get 'em back together.
- Let it go, friend.

841
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:42,386
He's not good enough
for her, and vice versa!

842
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,522
Thomas. Yes, we don't get along,

843
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:48,992
but I look at you... I
see driven, I see smart,

844
00:37:49,027 --> 00:37:51,728
and I just had the best Italian meal

845
00:37:51,763 --> 00:37:52,963
I've ever had in my life,

846
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:55,599
and I've been to Dallas.

847
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:57,100
- I'm in.
- No way.

848
00:37:57,135 --> 00:37:59,503
I'm not gonna let you take
another one of my businesses.

849
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:02,005
No, no, I'm in as a partner.

850
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,974
I'm always looking for new investments.

851
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:05,209
I've got an auto dealership.

852
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:06,443
I've got a massage parlor,

853
00:38:06,477 --> 00:38:09,213
a dry-cleaning
transactional holding company

854
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:12,316
that is doing unbelievably
well, I might add.

855
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,618
What do you say?

856
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:17,521
You know what? I'm not
really looking for investors,

857
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:20,490
given the almost embarrassing
level of success I've attained,

858
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:22,025
but I'll consider it.

859
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,460
Now, if you'll excuse me,

860
00:38:23,494 --> 00:38:25,062
I need to get some pictures
for my wall of fame.

861
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:28,599
Uh, excuse me, miss Hanley?
Do you mind if I snap a you-ie?

862
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:30,100
It's what I call selfies of other people.

863
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:31,101
Sure.

864
00:38:32,337 --> 00:38:34,004
Can I get everyone's attention, please?

865
00:38:34,038 --> 00:38:37,908
Our goal was to get 2,000 signatures

866
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,810
in support of the merger.

867
00:38:39,844 --> 00:38:41,578
We got...

868
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,380
almost 4,000

869
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:46,517
on the first night.

870
00:38:46,551 --> 00:38:48,852
Hey, everybody, let's
keep this party going.

871
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:50,954
The next round of gnocchi is on the house.

872
00:38:55,693 --> 00:38:57,527
You look sad, Knope.

873
00:38:57,562 --> 00:39:00,264
Couldn't find any takers for Chicago?

874
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,132
Everybody turned me down but Larry.

875
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,600
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

876
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:05,035
Well, cheer up.

877
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,371
You got a new job, new challenges,

878
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:08,839
all that crap you like.

879
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:11,775
Man, I'm gonna miss
Pawnee. I wish I could stay,

880
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:15,279
you know, keep an eye on
it, raise my kids here.

881
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:17,314
And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find

882
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:19,216
a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?

883
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,751
You will not, no.

884
00:39:20,785 --> 00:39:22,386
I know it's not easy to leave,

885
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,989
but this job does seem perfect.

886
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:28,759
Of course, I'd prefer you
use your talents elsewhere.

887
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:30,961
You know, with your
courage and small frame,

888
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:32,729
you'd make an excellent coal miner.

889
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:34,398
Thank you, Ron. That's very sweet.

890
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:36,667
It's time for you to move up in the world.

891
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:38,969
Your ambition was bound to take you away

892
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:41,004
from the town you love sooner or later,

893
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:42,906
and you can't have everything you want.

894
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:44,508
Oh, my God.

895
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,643
I can have everything I want!

896
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,011
- Thank you.
- I feel like

897
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:49,580
- you're not listening to me.
- Oh, and by the way,

898
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:52,516
don't think that we are
not discussing Duke silver.

899
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,618
When were you going to tell me about that?

900
00:39:54,652 --> 00:39:57,488
Unbelievable! I am so furious at you,

901
00:39:57,522 --> 00:39:59,022
but I've already forgiven
you, and you need to teach me

902
00:39:59,057 --> 00:40:00,390
how to play the saxophone.

903
00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:01,725
Okay, bye.

904
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:09,865
Hi, Leslie and everyone.

905
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:11,057
- I'm Grant...
- No time for small talk.

906
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:13,775
I think the best version of me working

907
00:40:13,895 --> 00:40:16,843
as Midwest regional
director is not in Chicago.

908
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:19,374
It's right here in Pawnee.

909
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:21,053
- How so?
- The financial savings here

910
00:40:21,173 --> 00:40:22,232
are enormous.

911
00:40:22,352 --> 00:40:24,242
I mean, the cost of
living is way lower here,

912
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:26,981
and renting the entire
third floor of this building

913
00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:29,941
would be way cheaper than a
much smaller space in Chicago.

914
00:40:29,976 --> 00:40:32,678
Pawnee is actually closer
to most of the parks

915
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:36,448
in the Midwest region, and
it's got Tom's Bistro...

916
00:40:36,482 --> 00:40:38,450
an exciting new-wave Italian eatery

917
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:40,752
that's equal parts Dean
Martin and Bruno Mars.

918
00:40:40,787 --> 00:40:42,254
But that's just what The Indianapolis Star

919
00:40:42,288 --> 00:40:43,455
is saying.

920
00:40:43,489 --> 00:40:45,090
Let's see what everyone else has to say.

921
00:40:45,124 --> 00:40:46,892
No, no, this is not what
we're doing right now.

922
00:40:46,926 --> 00:40:49,628
- But congrats.
- Leslie should stay here.

923
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:51,396
And if you don't agree with
us, it's nine against one,

924
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:52,798
and we can make you disappear forever.

925
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:55,467
- What?
- I said, "We have free wi-fi."

926
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:58,003
Look, Pawnee is a town on the rise,

927
00:40:58,037 --> 00:41:01,039
and national parks could
get in on the ground floor.

928
00:41:01,074 --> 00:41:04,576
It's the best option, hands down.

929
00:41:04,611 --> 00:41:07,579
Well, I'll run this up the flagpole.

930
00:41:07,614 --> 00:41:10,682
Also, can you bring back Power Rangers?

931
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:13,018
I don't know what it is you do,

932
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:16,121
but you seem important
enough to get that done.

933
00:41:16,155 --> 00:41:19,324
Sometimes you have to
make the hardest climb

934
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,159
to see the most beautiful sunrise.

935
00:41:21,194 --> 00:41:23,695
I read that once on an old
lady's decorative pillow.

936
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:26,031
But it is really how I feel today.

937
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:29,001
I've climbed a very
weird and rocky mountain,

938
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:31,103
and it was a pain in the
ass, and my legs are tired,

939
00:41:31,137 --> 00:41:34,072
and I'm starving, but the sun is rising

940
00:41:34,107 --> 00:41:36,775
over a sea of love and
waffles and possibility.

941
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:40,979
So I'm just gonna relax
and take a deep breath

942
00:41:41,014 --> 00:41:46,318
and enjoy this view for
as long as I possibly can.

943
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:51,056
Call Ken and Rebecca, and
no statements to the press

944
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,158
unless I personally release them.

945
00:41:53,192 --> 00:41:54,993
We are on a media lockdown.

946
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:58,297
Where is Ed with the file? Ed!

947
00:41:58,331 --> 00:42:00,432
I'm sorry, Miss Knope, I lost the file.

948
00:42:00,466 --> 00:42:02,534
- It's gone.
- Ed, you're a nice guy,

949
00:42:02,568 --> 00:42:04,770
but you're the most incompetent
person I've ever word with,

950
00:42:04,804 --> 00:42:07,439
and that includes Terry.

951
00:42:07,473 --> 00:42:10,142
Jeez! Get it together, Terry.

952
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:12,077
Clean out your desk. You're fired.

953
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:13,812
I understand. Thank you for the literally

954
00:42:13,846 --> 00:42:15,486
hundreds of opportunities you've given me.

955
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:17,832
Good-bye, everyone. It's
been a great three years.

956
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,026
Cancel my flight to South
Dakota. We'll do it next month.

957
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,736
- Babe, what's our play here?
- Everyone's waiting downstairs in my office.

958
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,374
Let's just go hear what they have to say.

959
00:42:24,494 --> 00:42:25,479
But honey, tonight's your big night.

960
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,737
No, this is more important.
Where are the kids?

961
00:42:27,857 --> 00:42:30,308
- Right here.
- Hey, guys!

962
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:32,383
Mommy and daddy had to do a little work,

963
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:34,660
and you're gonna have a fun
play date with Uncle Andy

964
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:37,172
- and Aunty April, okay?
- Let's go, munchkins.

965
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:39,594
I forgot, Ben... how many bags
of marshmallows do I give them?

966
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:42,244
None! Just let April do everything.

967
00:42:42,364 --> 00:42:44,815
One day, in the distant future,

968
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:47,247
things will be calm and normal, right?

969
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:49,434
Probably not. But that's okay.

970
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:51,675
- You ready?
- Not at all.

971
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:54,537
But that's never stopped us before.

972
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:03,381
