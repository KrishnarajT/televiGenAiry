1
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:11,050
God!

2
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:12,051
Sorry! Sorry!

3
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:13,219
What's happening?

4
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:14,387
I can't hear!

5
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:15,988
And I'm dying!

6
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:16,989
Baby, relax.

7
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:18,157
I just wanted to surprise you.

8
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:20,793
Open the bottom drawer
and read the cake.

9
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:24,997
"Will you go to prom with me?"

10
00:00:25,031 --> 00:00:27,400
Well, this just keeps
getting weirder.

11
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,034
Because of the merger,

12
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:30,703
schools have had
to make some cuts,

13
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,738
and the first thing to go
was the senior prom.

14
00:00:32,773 --> 00:00:35,074
So as a last-minute hail Mary,

15
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:38,344
the parks department
is throwing prom for them.

16
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:40,179
They also wanted
to cut A.P. Latin,

17
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:41,914
so I volunteered to teach Latin.

18
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:44,316
Which reminds me,
I need to learn Latin.

19
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:46,485
I can't stop thinking
about that job in Chicago,

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,754
and I think this prom
will be a good distraction.

21
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:50,589
In my senior year
when I couldn't decide

22
00:00:50,624 --> 00:00:52,424
between Indiana and Amherst,

23
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:54,427
I focused all my energy
on planning my prom,

24
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:55,761
and it was the best prom ever.

25
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:58,330
Plus, I made out with Harvey
from the A.V. Club.

26
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,332
Hmm, I think
I'm jealous of Harvey.

27
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:01,333
You shouldn't be.

28
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:02,835
A few weeks later,
he almost died

29
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:04,336
from a VCR electrocution.

30
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:05,671
Legend has it

31
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:07,339
that he can still
turn on a microwave

32
00:01:07,374 --> 00:01:08,574
just by blinking at it.

33
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,575
The point is,

34
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,377
will you go to the prom with me?

35
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,212
Well, I thought
you'd never ask,

36
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:14,780
because we're nearing 40.

37
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:16,115
Course I will.

38
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,451
Yay! Prom!

39
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:29,495

40
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:41,640
Okay, we are making progress,
prom committee.

41
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,909
Now, our budget
is basically zero,

42
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:45,745
so we're gonna need
to cover all the jobs

43
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:47,480
that we would normally
hire people for.

44
00:01:47,514 --> 00:01:49,482
Tom, you're in charge of music.

45
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:51,984
Oh, man.
Well, all right.

46
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:53,986
Aw, did you want to DJ,
little puppy?

47
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,821
I didn't know
that little puppies

48
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:58,491
could operate an iPod
with their little puppy paws.

49
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:00,159
Eew and boo.

50
00:02:00,193 --> 00:02:01,994
This kind of thing is getting
out of hand with you two.

51
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,796
Y'all are on official warning.

52
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,965
I did DJ a little
back in the day.

53
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,334
I had a show called
"Zoot Suit Wyatt"

54
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:09,668
on Carleton College radio.

55
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:11,170
Tuesdays from 3:00 to 5:00 A.M.,

56
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:12,672
I was the king of swing.

57
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:14,673
I thought
we as a culture agreed

58
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,675
to forget the year
that everyone was into swing.

59
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,577
Okay, Ben, you can co-DJ
with Tom.

60
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:20,146
- Yes.
- What! No!

61
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,814
If you eclipse my flavor
in any way,

62
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:23,015
we'll have a problem.

63
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,416
All right, Allison,
you are in charge

64
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:25,618
of choosing the prom theme,

65
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:27,853
and now it has to be perfect
and magical

66
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:29,855
and look like a million bucks
but cost zero bucks.

67
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,190
So what do you got?

68
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:33,692
I was thinking the theme
could be "Fairy tale."

69
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:35,767
The theater department
did Into the Woods last year,

70
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:37,129
and we still have the scenery.

71
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:39,131
I laid out
some preliminary plans

72
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:40,166
in this binder.

73
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,168
Wow!

74
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:45,104
Are those jense-trodder
color tabs?

75
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:46,372
I thought those
were discontinued.

76
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:47,373
They were.

77
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:48,441
I had to order them

78
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:49,642
through some Mexican
back channels.

79
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,510
Juan Julio Oficina Supplies?

80
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:52,845
I thought
they went out of business.

81
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
They did, but they opened up
a new one in Oaxaca.

82
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:57,049
What is happening right now?

83
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:58,884
Okay, everybody
get back to work.

84
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,886
And, Allison,
come by my office later

85
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:02,955
so we can keep crushing it.

86
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,790
All right,
let's go over our set list.

87
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:06,859
- Set list? No need.
- So, what,

88
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,061
you're just gonna put your iPod
on shuffle?

89
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,663
No, but I could.
You want to know why?

90
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,166
Because every single song
you own is a banger?

91
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,968
Every song I download

92
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,803
has to pass a series
of rigorous tests

93
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:20,473
to answer one simple question:

94
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:21,807
Is it a banger?

95
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:22,908
How many beats per minute?

96
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:24,009
How many drops?

97
00:03:24,044 --> 00:03:25,644
How dope are the drops?

98
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,380
Were any acoustic instruments
used?

99
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,682
If so, it is not a banger.

100
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:32,051
I once accidentally downloaded
a Lumineers song.

101
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,019
I had to throw away
my whole computer

102
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:35,254
just to be safe.

103
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:36,889
I feel like, to me,

104
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:39,091
set list flow is very important.

105
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:41,227
I mean,
we're basically vibe curators.

106
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:42,661
Ugh. Oh, no.

107
00:03:42,696 --> 00:03:44,830
I hope that high school
auditorium's big enough,

108
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:47,833
'cause I'm bringing
10,000 maniacs.

109
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:50,403
Sometimes it's really hard
to be friends with you.

110
00:03:50,437 --> 00:03:51,871
Thank God we don't have
to be seen together.

111
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:53,673
Yes, we do.
We're co-DJs.

112
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:54,740
Not anymore.

113
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:57,042
You're working with...

114
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:59,045
DJ Robo Drop.

115
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,447
♪ Ba-da-da, mm, mm, mm,
mm-mm ♪

116
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:05,518
Oh, I hope that this prom
is exactly like my senior prom.

117
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:07,686
Theme:
"My heart will go on."

118
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,022
Photo booth
with Monica Lewinsky look-alike.

119
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,891
After-party...
Megan Rickerson's house.

120
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:14,226
Her parents used to let us drink
as much as we wanted.

121
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:16,395
That's... that's
where we should have

122
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,563
this after-party.

123
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:18,564
Or, no, we can't,

124
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,399
because they moved to prison.

125
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:21,755
Prom is nothing
but a huge party

126
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:23,235
full of smiling, dancing people

127
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,670
enjoying themselves.

128
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:26,672
It's literally
my worst nightmare.

129
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:27,940
And I hate punch.

130
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:29,775
April Ludgate,

131
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,277
I'm gonna sing to you a song

132
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:33,279
that I first wrote 15 years ago

133
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:36,882

Will you?

143
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,142
Fine.
I'll go with you,

144
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,844
because Leslie's making us,

145
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:06,112
and we live together,

146
00:05:06,146 --> 00:05:07,780
and we only have one car
right now

147
00:05:07,814 --> 00:05:09,014
because you laked mine.

148
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,349
What does "laked" mean?

149
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:11,851
I tried to jump it over a lake.

150
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:13,686
Why don't you stay out
of our conversations, Larry!

151
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,955
Will do.

152
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:17,123
So I want to show you

153
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,791
some very cool
before and after pictures

154
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:20,192
of Cherryhurst Park,

155
00:05:20,227 --> 00:05:22,828
one of our greatest
accomplishments.

156
00:05:22,863 --> 00:05:24,497
Why are you showing me
all this?

157
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,831
Because I think
you have a real knack

158
00:05:25,866 --> 00:05:27,667
for public service.
We here at the parks department

159
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,135
have something called

160
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:31,637
"The April Ludgate
Summer Solstice Druid Festival

161
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,539
and Buffalo Wings
Eating Contest."

162
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:35,174
I don't know why
I let her name it.

163
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,843
Basically, it's a summer
internship program.

164
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,545
I think you'd be great.

165
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,013
Do you want to work here?

166
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,948
Definitely!
I'm totally interested.

167
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:44,917
- Great.
- Allison Gliffert.

168
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:46,252
Hi, Mr. Swanson.

169
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:47,753
You two know each other?

170
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:49,255
Is there some secret society

171
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:51,023
for the greatest humans
on earth?

172
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:53,326
Do you meet Tom Hanks
and Elena Kagan

173
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,327
in the Statue
of Liberty's crown?

174
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:58,497
God, this fake club
I'm inventing is amazing.

175
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,199
Allison's father
owns the hardware store

176
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:01,267
I've been going to

177
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:03,302
since before Allison
was even born.

178
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:05,604
What brings you to the festering
putrid stink hole

179
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,740
on the armpit of freedom?

180
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:08,874
That's what he calls city hall.

181
00:06:08,909 --> 00:06:10,843
Um, Leslie was just telling me

182
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:12,044
about your summer internship,

183
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,345
and I was thinking
about taking it.

184
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,814
Oh, no, no, no, no.

185
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:15,848
No.

186
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:17,416
I respect your father too much

187
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,418
to let his daughter
work for free

188
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:20,653
for the government.

189
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:22,722
Why don't you get a paying job
for the summer?

190
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,824
Why don't you shut
your mustache?

191
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,726
- Sorry.
- You know what?

192
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,860
Tim Hautner,

193
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:29,128
who owns the sawmill out
on Lowell Drive,

194
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:30,496
is a personal friend.

195
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,199
He's always looking
for bright young employees

196
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:36,202
to give money to
in exchange for honest work.

197
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:37,470
That would be awesome.

198
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:38,904
I definitely need money
for school.

199
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:39,939
Oh, really?

200
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:41,107
Is it worth a few bucks

201
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:42,575
to get a million splinters
in your fingers

202
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:44,944
and then cut off your fingers
accidentally,

203
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:47,279
'cause that will happen.

204
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:50,916
I have tolerated Leslie's
pro-government ways

205
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,586
because her annoying kindness
and generosity

206
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,888
sneakily made me like her
as a person.

207
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:58,958
But I draw the line
at corrupting America's youth.

208
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:01,093
I'm sure I can get Allison a job

209
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:02,762
at Tim Hautner's sawmill.

210
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:05,097
I once did him a favor.

211
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,199
I built his sawmill.

212
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:08,701
I may be
leaving this office soon.

213
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:11,237
I need to plant seeds
for the next generation.

214
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:13,205
Interns become full-time staff,

215
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,707
become department directors.

216
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:16,375
Circle of life.

217
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,643
The seasons turn.

218
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:20,613
It's really quite beautiful.

219
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:22,281
And if Ron tries to stop me,

220
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:24,628
he can eat
a big ol' bowl of butts.

221
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,028
Hee hee!
Hah hah yeah!

222
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,748
Pawnee!

223
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,617
Class of '99!

224
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,252
Uh-huh!

225
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,721
Ooh!

226
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,119
Girl, you look creepy.

227
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,460
Would you like a drink?

228
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,962
- All this stuff is free.
- No, it's not.

229
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,520
Why'd you pay for a limo?

230
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:44,788
Because it's prom.

231
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:46,089
If you don't show up in a limo,

232
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:47,323
legally, they can't let you in.

233
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:49,059
Does your mom want
to take pictures?

234
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,794
Uh, yeah, she does.

235
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:52,329
Hey, hey! Orin!

236
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:53,630
Who's Orin?

237
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:56,132
I'm April's mom.

238
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,068
You two look adorable.

239
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,037
Ugh, just take the picture
already, mom.

240
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:03,406
My baby is all grown up.

241
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,375
Have her home by 11:00.

242
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:07,210
Mom, stop embarrassing me.

243
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:09,713
Say good-bye to your father.

244
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,584
Bye, dad.

245
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:15,919
Good night, sir.

246
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,713
This is all the stuff
we have to work with?

247
00:08:17,722 --> 00:08:19,155
Where's everything I requested?

248
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,390
Where's my smoke machine?

249
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:21,858
Where's my girls dressed
in Teddy Bear costumes?

250
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:22,892
Where's my Yeezus Mountain?

251
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,094
Yeah, tell me about it.

252
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,196
I specifically requested
elliptical cartridges

253
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,864
for the turntables.

254
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,699
How am I supposed to keep
my Husker Du albums

255
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:31,067
in near-mint condish?

256
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:32,235
Hey, I have an idea.

257
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,503
Why don't you throw them
in the garbage?

258
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:35,972
My prom was right after
I got impeached,

259
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:38,808
so I couldn't leave the house
without being egged.

260
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:42,312
But my parents threw me a prom
in our living room.

261
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:45,181
I think I'm still messed up
from it.

262
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,317
I was actually only at my prom
for 15 minutes.

263
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:49,152
By the time
I got my Armani suit pressed

264
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:52,355
and got the little dimple
on my tie just right,

265
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,790
it was 11:45 P.M.

266
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,291
My date was pretty pissed,

267
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,295
but, uh, I looked fly as hell.

268
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,630
Leslie, thanks again.

269
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,732
We just wouldn't have
had a prom without you.

270
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,901
This is A-plus work.

271
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:07,070
A-plus!
Thank you, Principal Russell.

272
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:08,204
Can I get that in writing?

273
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,472
Oh-ho, Leslie.

274
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,741
You haven't changed
since high school.

275
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,376
I can't believe
he gave you an A-plus.

276
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:14,544
Oh, did he?
I didn't even notice.

277
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:15,712
No bigs.

278
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:17,386
Listen, Allison,
I have a question for you

279
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,082
that's very important
and very serious.

280
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:20,083
Listen to me closely.

281
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:22,252
Will you help me

282
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:23,453
orchestrate the balloon drop?

283
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,523
Ms. Knope,

284
00:09:26,557 --> 00:09:27,924
it'd be my honor.

285
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,926
Oh, hooray!

286
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,594
- Allison.
- Oh.

287
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,163
I was subcontracted
by the government

288
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,497
to construct a lighting rig.

289
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,599
Would like to help me

290
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,767
screw some angle irons
onto some 2x4s?

291
00:09:37,802 --> 00:09:40,270
- I'll give you $40.
- Yeah, sure.

292
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:42,138
I'll just
be over here having fun.

293
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:43,139
See you soon!

294
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,474
I know what you're doing, Ron,

295
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:45,709
and I will defeat you.

296
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:46,943
Mark my words.

297
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,445
Stop wasting helium.

298
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,779
It is intended for welding

299
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:51,014
and filling air ships.

300
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:53,416
I attended prom

301
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,818
with Susan Hofler.

302
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:56,152
Picked her up in my truck,

303
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:58,655
we slow-danced
to a Merle Haggard song,

304
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:00,156
and then I left early

305
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:02,025
to go to my shift at the quarry.

306
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,694
I was 12 years old.

307
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,696
Never went again.

308
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,633
Felt like I had outgrown it.

309
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:14,037
Well, we did it.
We went to prom.

310
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,272
Yay!
Let's go now.

311
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:16,439
No! What?
Are you kidding?

312
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:17,707
This is awesome.

313
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,975
Look around.

314
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,110
The bloom of youth.

315
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:22,379
Like flowers on the sunset

316
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,781
of an eagle's poetry.

317
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:27,651
- Andy, I hate teenagers.
- If you give this a chance,

318
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:29,486
you're gonna love it,
I promise.

319
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,987
It's like the movie
Expendables 2.

320
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,322
First time, hated it.

321
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:34,324
Second time, hated it.

322
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,826
Third time, it was okay.

323
00:10:36,861 --> 00:10:38,695
But then the fourth, fifth,
sixth, seventh, tenth time

324
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,196
I watched it,

325
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,865
I realized something.

326
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:43,366
It's just... it's not good.

327
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,634
It's not a good movie.

328
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,836
Now that I've convinced you,

329
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,338
why don't we go dance?

330
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:50,674
Um, I'm gonna go
to the girls' bathroom

331
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,342
to check the trash cans
for babies,

332
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,010
but you can dance if you want.

333
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,712
Really? I love you!

00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:43,953
There's a little trick to it.

361
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,395
You want to hold it...
not too tight,

362
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:47,063
sort of like a firm handshake...

363
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:49,566
and then move
towards the ground

364
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,134
in a rope-pulling motion.

365
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,403
So just pull the rope?

366
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:54,404
That's right.

367
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,239
Thanks, Leslie, for this,

368
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:58,508
and for making prom happen
in the first place.

369
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,782
Oh, you don't have to thank me.

370
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,745
Working for the government
is its own reward...

371
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:02,879
Run, Allison, run.

372
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:04,547
You're wasting your time,
Leslie.

373
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,550
Allison and I already
had a good talk

374
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:08,718
about the power
of the hard-earned dollar.

375
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:11,321
Don't listen to him.
Now, when you pull the rope,

376
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,656
don't look at the balloons.

377
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,658
Look at the faces of the people

378
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,126
as the balloons drop.

379
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,594
That's what government is about.

380
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:18,762
Look at the faces.

381
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,263
No, look at the cage

382
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:22,265
that is holding
all of those balloons.

383
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,935
I assembled that cage
and was paid for my labor,

384
00:12:24,969 --> 00:12:26,269
and I will use the money

385
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:28,071
to buy shelter, fuel,
and medicine.

386
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:29,072
Watch the cage.

387
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:30,774
Pull the rope.
Watch the faces.

388
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:32,943
- Watch the cage.
- Watch the faces!

389
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,344
Uh, erm...

390
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,649
Congratulations, Ron.
You've ruined prom.

391
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:41,351
Everybody's having
a terrible time.

392
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,289
I didn't go to my prom.

393
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:48,592
I was dating an older fella
back then.

394
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:50,260
Like I'm gonna dance
with a bunch of kids

395
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:51,928
while he's coaching Duke
to the final four.

396
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:54,664
I just want to go home,
but I feel bad

397
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:56,333
because Andy's having
such a good time.

398
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:00,937
Whoa!

399
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:04,007
How can I love someone
when I hate everything he loves?

400
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,041
That's not true.

401
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,543
He loves a lot of dumb stuff,

402
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,011
but he loves you the most.

403
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,846
If something's bothering you,
just tell him.

404
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,681
It's always better
to be direct.

405
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,650
Hey, girl.
Are you ready to go?

406
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:15,218
I feel like I told you
to wait in the car.

407
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,887
Yeah.

408
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,289
See?

409
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,790
Be direct.

410
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,894
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

411
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,929
Ugh!

412
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,230
You're finished, Knope.

413
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,566
I just spoke with Tim Hautner
from the sawmill

414
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,234
on my mobile telephone,

415
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,403
and he's offering Allison
a paying job.

416
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,338
She'll be assistant
to the head mulcher.

417
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:36,506
Beat that.

418
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,174
First of all,
your telephone is ridiculous.

419
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:39,843
And second of all,
I already beat it.

420
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:41,278
She's gonna take
that internship.

421
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:43,113
She pulled the rope.
There's no turning back!

422
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,448
Leslie.
Mr. Swanson.

423
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:48,051
May I see both of you
in my office?

424
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:49,586
Now.

425
00:13:51,055 --> 00:13:52,889
It has come to my attention

426
00:13:52,924 --> 00:13:55,825
that both of you have been
harassing Allison

427
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,661
about her summer employment
decisions.

428
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,329
I wouldn't say "harassing"

429
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,765
so much as
persistently tormenting.

430
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,833
I am disappointed in you,
Leslie.

431
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:06,102
No!
Don't be disappointed in me.

432
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,737
I've never had a principal
or a teacher

433
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:09,072
be disappointed in me.

434
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,740
I'm not sure that I'm equipped
to handle it.

435
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:12,695
Whatever's going on
between you two and Allison

436
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,344
ends right now.

437
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,780
This is supposed
to be a fun event for the kids.

438
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,114
You're absolutely right,

439
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,383
and I will bow out immediately.

440
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:21,551
Thank you.

441
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,053
I think the only thing
that matters

442
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:24,888
is whatever A-pluses

443
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,723
may or may not
have been handed out,

444
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:28,892
you know, are still in effect

445
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,026
in perpetuity.

446
00:14:30,061 --> 00:14:31,861
I have your word, then.

447
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:33,129
This ends now?

448
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,599
Absolutely.

449
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,200
Attention, everyone.

450
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:39,536
Now it is time
for the most magical moment

451
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,038
of any high school prom:

452
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:43,707
The announcement of the winner

453
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:46,776
of the Parks and Recreation's
coveted summer internship.

454
00:14:49,113 --> 00:14:50,247
Without further ado,

455
00:14:50,281 --> 00:14:51,915
help me congratulate

456
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,750
Allison Gliffert!

457
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:56,786
Can we get a little music here
maybe?

458
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:58,922
Probably just ruin the moment
with something lame.

459
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:00,257
Leslie, I told you.

460
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,591
I don't know what
I'm doing this summer.

461
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,106
That's okay.
I know what you're doing.

462
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:04,394
You're gonna take
this internship.

463
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:06,029
You're gonna fall in love
with public service.

464
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:07,397
You're gonna rise
through the ranks.

465
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,899
You'll take over Ron's job
as parks director.

466
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,400
You'll win a seat in congress,

467
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,302
and then you and I will run
against each other as president,

468
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:13,776
but right before
we find out who won,

469
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:15,238
I'm gonna pat you on the back
and say,

470
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:17,574
"It's your turn, kid."

471
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:18,816
Sorry, children.

472
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:20,367
Forget this happened.

473
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,813
Continue with your awkward
close-quarters gyrating.

474
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:25,815
And if this is the evening

475
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,524
you decide to have sex,
use protection, please!

476
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:32,731
Dude, if you're not gonna
play anything,

477
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:33,722
I'm stepping in.

478
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:35,224
Go ahead.
Play whatever you want.

479
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:36,258
Can't be any worse than this.

480
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,034
Hey, I love this song!

481
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:46,302
You actually like this?

482
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,204
Yeah, dude, it's classic rock.

483
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,939
Well, there's more
where that came from,

484
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:52,074
snoopies!

485
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:53,075
Sorry.

486
00:15:53,109 --> 00:15:54,410
Tried to use slang.

487
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:55,578
That just came out.

488
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,413
I only listen to CDs.

489
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:59,748
It's the way music like this
was meant to be heard.

490
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:02,585
But it's not even auto-tuned.

491
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:05,421
Where'd you get that dress?

492
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:07,089
I was buried in it.

493
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,559
Babe, huge news.

494
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,263
I just got us invited
to Damian Keating's barn party.

495
00:16:15,966 --> 00:16:17,266
He's captain of the soccer team,

496
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,601
and he has a fake I.D.,

497
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:21,504
so I think he can
get us all free beer.

498
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,606
What's wrong?

499
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,741
There's cupcakes and music.

500
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,309
Why aren't you having fun?

501
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:30,479
Because this prom
reminds me that...

502
00:16:30,514 --> 00:16:32,781
you had, like, a million friends
in high school

503
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,917
and everyone thought
you were awesome,

504
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,753
and I spent four years
making fun of everyone

505
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,756
and hiding mops so the janitor
would think he was going insane.

506
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,158
If we went
to high school together,

507
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:43,325
we would have
never started dating,

508
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,494
which means that...

509
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:46,996
we would have
never gotten married,

510
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,198
and I don't like thinking
about that.

511
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:51,033
Hey, maybe we wouldn't
have gotten together

512
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,701
if we were in high school.

513
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:56,338
But that's because kids
in high school are idiots.

514
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:57,673
The only thing that matters is

515
00:16:57,707 --> 00:17:00,109
that we found each other
right now,

516
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:01,811
and it's the best.

517
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,880
You know what?

518
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:06,048
Let's bail.

519
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,983
We got that limo
for three more hours.

520
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:09,418
I think the extra length

521
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:11,287
could help us get us
over that lake.

522
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,489
No. Let's stay.

523
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:14,790
I'll have fun.

524
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,025
I promise.

525
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:19,362
I have never told you this,

526
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:21,864
but I actually have
a ten-point scale

527
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:24,100
for how insane you are being.

528
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:26,335
I observe your behavior,

529
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,204
and if it's a five or below,
I say nothing.

530
00:17:28,238 --> 00:17:30,039
Smart.
Saves a lot of time.

531
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:32,041
If it reaches a six,

532
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:33,709
like for example the incident

533
00:17:33,744 --> 00:17:36,278
with the girls' soccer uniforms
back in '05...

534
00:17:36,313 --> 00:17:38,781
They wrote all the team names
in pink.

535
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,616
Nobody told them to do that.

536
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,852
I try to steer you back
to safety.

537
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,854
A seven is when I lock you
in your office

538
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:46,455
until you cool down.

539
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,225
This Allison Gliffert thing
may have hit an eight.

540
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,894
I have the police on standby.

541
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,729
It's your move.

542
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:57,166
I'm thinking of leaving Pawnee,

543
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,568
moving to Chicago.

544
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:01,070
I just need to make sure

545
00:18:01,104 --> 00:18:04,406
that the future is secure
around here when I leave.

546
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:05,574
You know?

547
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:07,076
Allison would become April,

548
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,078
and then April would become me.

549
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:10,246
I mean, let's face it, Ron.

550
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,347
I love you,

551
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,115
but you're hopeless without me.

552
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,118
Blueprints for the future

553
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:17,520
are a fool's errand.

554
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,688
They're like blueprints
for a house.

555
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,023
Nice to have,

556
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:22,358
but any foreman
with half a brain

557
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,793
doesn't need to look at them.

558
00:18:23,827 --> 00:18:27,296
One day,
this year or maybe the next,

559
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,965
you're gonna be somewhere else.

560
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,601
So enjoy yourself now.

561
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:34,937
Damn it.

562
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:37,106
I just wish once

563
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,809
you would say something stupid
so I could ignore it.

564
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,747
Attention, please.
The votes are in.

565
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:47,850
And your Pawnee high prom
king and queen

566
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:51,487
are... Lucy Taylor

567
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,988
and Andy Dwyer!

568
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:54,323
What?

569
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:56,158
I broke the box,
and I threw away all the votes,

570
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:57,927
and I voted for you
a thousand times.

571
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,829
You should get on up there,
King Dwyer.

572
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:02,565
Not without my queen.

573
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:07,503
Hi, Pawnee High.

574
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,971
As your prom king,

575
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:10,473
I'm your ruler.

576
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:12,908
Silence!

577
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,678
My first decree of power

578
00:19:15,712 --> 00:19:19,148
is to declare
that the prom queen

579
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:21,150
shall be my wife,
April Ludgate,

580
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:23,018
who is the best thing
that's ever happened to me

581
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:25,187
who came to prom
even though she hates it.

582
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:26,188
Give me this.

583
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:27,456
Always next year.

584
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:29,291
No, there isn't.
I'm a senior.

585
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:31,160
This is your wife?
How old are you?

586
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:33,462
He's 33, and I'm 47/immortal.

587
00:19:33,497 --> 00:19:34,463
Get out.

588
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:36,665
High school forever!

589
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:40,536
Yeah, you're having fun now.

590
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,538
I rigged an election
and got kicked out of prom.

591
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:44,006
I can get on board with that.

I'm officially old and uncool.

597
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,659
Might as well start wearing
a plaid shirt

598
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:01,261
and a tie and khakis

599

you're wearing.

Look, the fact
that you don't know

601
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:06,800
what high schoolers are into
doesn't make you uncool.

602
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,635
It makes you
a normal human adult.

603
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:11,204
You haven't had time to keep up
'cause the last few years,

604
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:12,705
you started two different
businesses.

605
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,107
I guess that's true.

606
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:16,609
Richard Branson and Mark Cuban
are too busy making deals

607
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:18,278
to keep up
with what the kids are into.

608

How else do you explain
their terrible haircuts?

609
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:22,048
And, hey, you may be old,

610
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:23,716
but you'll never be as old
as me.

611
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:26,719
Yeah.
You're old as [bleep].

612
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:27,821
Thanks, Ben.

for acting so bananas.

617
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:39,499
You just have so much promise,
we got excited.

618

You're a good kid.
And whatever you choose,

you'll be great at it.

I have to say
I admire you both.

You were right, Leslie.

622
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,641
Watching all those happy faces,
it felt amazing.

Ugh, Ron, she is so thoughtful
and grounded.

626
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:55,682
Get her away from me,
or I'm gonna kidnap her

627

What up, Knope?

631
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:06,159
Hello, Gregory.

632
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:07,494
You guys know each other?

633
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:09,095
You might say that.

634
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,831
Come on, baby.
Let's get out of here.

who used to prank us
all the time, right?

Offer is off the table.

638
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,938
She's a terrible person
with terrible judgment.
