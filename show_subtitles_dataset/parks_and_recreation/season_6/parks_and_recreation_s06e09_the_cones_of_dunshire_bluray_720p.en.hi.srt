1
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:12,105
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

2
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:15,660
No, babe. Are you ready?

3
00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:16,370
Yes?

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,410
I got fired from running
the Sweetums Foundation.

5
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:20,036
Thanks to me.
Sorry, again.

6
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,179
Hey, blessing in disguise.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,764
I took a job
at this accounting firm,

8
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:26,199
they've tried to hire me
three times, I finally gave in.

9
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:28,802
But I've had a week off
in between jobs,

10
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:31,455
and I've been cooking up
something pretty big.

11
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:33,690
The last time
he was in between jobs,

12
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:35,675
he got deep into claymation,

13
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:39,463
so this should be different,
hopefully.

14
00:00:39,514 --> 00:00:42,199
Presenting
"The Cones of Dunshire,"

15
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:46,303
a brand-new gaming experience.
8 to 12 players.

16
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:49,356
Two wizards, a Maverick,
the arbiter, two warriors,

17
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,058
a corporal, and a ledgerman.

18
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,776
Now, the ledgerman
just keeps score,

19
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,078
and he wears this hat.

20
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:56,162
Oh, boy.

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,898
Now, the object
is to accumulate cones.

22
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,334
Four cones wins,
but in order to get a cone,

23
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:02,436
you have to build
a civilization.

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,405
The other amazing thing
is the challenge play.

25
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,341
Actually, let me tell you
more about the trivia cards,

26
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,209
'cause you're gonna need to know
about roadblocks first.

27
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:11,111
Nah, never mind. The thing
about the challenge play

28
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:14,514
is that it's basically
the game... in reverse.

29
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,100
Then you roll three dice to see
how many dice you roll with.

30
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:19,036
Oh, 16.
Perfect, lots of choices.

31
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,939
Okay, each turn goes:
Roll, buy, action.

32
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:24,024
I mean, obviously, this would be
much taller in the real game.

33
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:25,909
But the corporal can veto.

34
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:27,377
This should be green too.
How did this happen?

35
00:01:27,412 --> 00:01:29,496
Are the cones a metaphor?
Well, yes and no.

36
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,249
- What is this called again?
- "The Cones of Dunshire."

37
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:34,301
Oh, my God, the Maverick should

38
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:36,270
be able to trade lumber
for agriculture credits.

39
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,207
How have I not
thought of this before?

40
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:41,291
This is nothing, right?

41
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:42,926
When do you go
back to work again?

42
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:43,961
Tomorrow. It's fine.

43
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:44,962
I'll just throw this
in the garbage.

As soon as Knope is gone,

46
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:08,652
these are going up
all over Chambers.

47
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:10,203
Jamm for three!

48
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,404
Ha ha! What,
are you trying to build a house

49
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,040
with those bricks?

50
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:14,941
Ooh!
The girl is attacking me.

51
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:17,010
Any new business
before we adjourn?

52
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:18,512
Yes, I have one...

53
00:02:18,546 --> 00:02:19,479
the Pawnee Commons.

54
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,697
Oh, boy.

55
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:22,012
The money
for the Pawnee Commons,

56
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:24,101
aka the greatest future park
in the world,

57
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:25,435
aka my personal dream project...

58
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,321
Aka...

59
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,840
Is currently
in a discretionary fund.

60
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:31,291
I'd like to move it
to a lockbox,

61
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:33,243
to ensure that it is used
for that project.

62
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,796
The thing is, Leslie,
this kind of decision is...

63
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,514
it's not really up
to you anymore.

64
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:40,900
Because the voters, to use
a technical political term,

65
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,636
gave you the stanky boot.

66
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,738
But we'll keep your money safe,
baby girl.

67
00:02:44,772 --> 00:02:45,906
What, you think
I'm gonna use it

68
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,624
to put a new limestone shower
in my office?

69
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,259
Yeah, now I do.

70
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,794
I propose that
we table this discussion

71
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:53,380
until, let's say,
the second Knope is gone.

72
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:55,081
Later, bunheads.

73
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:56,266
Glass!

74
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:59,970
Video Ron demand.

75
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,287
What you carrying, my dude?

76
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:03,740
The time has come
to sell my cabin.

77
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,742
But I haven't had much luck
finding a buyer.

78
00:03:05,793 --> 00:03:07,344
"For sale. Small house.

79
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:08,979
Location: Forest."

80
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,563
It's a little wordy,
don't you think?

81
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:11,748
"Current owner will not
clean up

82
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:15,468
shotgun shells
or animal carcasses."

83
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,987
The hell is wrong with you,
Swanson?

84
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,455
Fine, I'll clean up
the shotgun shells,

85
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,074
but the carcasses remain
to fertilize my berry patch.

86
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,110
If you really want to unload
that little horror cabin,

87
00:03:23,144 --> 00:03:25,595
you gonna need a professional
to stage it properly.

88
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,233
Lucky for you, I recently
got my real estate license.

89
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:31,851
Spladow!

90
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:32,852
Check it.

91
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,671
"Regal Meagle Realty."

92
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:37,474
"Find your castle."

93
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:40,093
Fine, I suppose
I could use some help.

94
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:41,428
Yo, Donna,
let me get a little skin

95
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:42,846
in the game,
maybe split that commission?

96
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,201
All right.
Show me what you got.

97
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:45,565
I'll split that commish.

98
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,784
â™ª Split that commish

99
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:49,719
The question I always
ask myself is,

100
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,405
what kind of mogul should I be?

101
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,707
Fashion mogul,
energy drink mogul.

102
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,542
I even thought
about downhill skiing.

103
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:56,576
A mogul mogul.

104
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,762
But a real estate mogul?

105
00:03:58,813 --> 00:03:59,813
Hmm.

106
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:02,132
That's a hot mogul right now.

107
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,217
Ben Wyatt, reporting for duty.

108
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,719
How you doing, Barney?
Good to see you again.

109
00:04:05,753 --> 00:04:09,022
I just can't believe
it's finally happening.

110
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:11,842
Dad! He's here!

111
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,660
He really came!

112
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,312
Hello, Ben. I'm Frank.

113
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:17,781
I took the job
when you passed it up last time.

114
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:18,799
Heard a lot about you.

115
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,667
Well, all good things, I hope.

116
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:21,801
A little too good.

117
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,303
Let's see if you live up
to the hype.

118
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,256
I'm not joking.

119
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,641
Oh.

120
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,177
Frank seems cool.

121
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:32,195
Well, tell everybody
in Michigan I said hi,

122
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,464
and tell your mom that
I love the banana cake

123
00:04:34,515 --> 00:04:35,482
she posted on Pinterest.

124
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:37,284
Oh, the father of your child
is here.

125
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,568
I have to go.
I'll talk to you soon.

126
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:39,886
- I love you.
- Was that Ann?

127
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,721
I hope you were speaking
to her in a calming voice

128
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:43,273
'cause babies can hear
everything.

129
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,859
Baby, if you can still hear me,
I love you.

130
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:47,527
- The phone is hung up.
- Oh.

131
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:50,463
You got my message
about Jamm being a dinkhead?

132
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:53,049
Yes, but as city manager,
I can't play sides.

133
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,084
And I think
all of our heads can be

134
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:55,635
a little dinky at times.

135
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,187
Fine, but his is the dinkiest.

136
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:59,105
And I would know
because I'm keeping score.

137
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:01,124
Ever since
I started city council,

138
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,144
I have gone head-to-head
with Jamm 112 times.

139
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,164
He has won 56 times,
I have won 56 times.

140
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:10,350
I will not lose
our last battle.

141
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:14,287
Will you help me?

142
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,639
No.

143
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:16,673
Oh.

144
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:17,841
The way you stood up like that,

145
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:19,192
I thought it was gonna go
a different way.

146
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:21,411
No, I can't help directly,
but I am on your side.

147
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:24,397
And I will assist you
in any way that I can.

148
00:05:24,432 --> 00:05:26,266
Maybe I can mediate,
like Dr. Phil,

149
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,736
only qualified.

150
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:30,835
So what's the story, Ron?

151
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,005
Diane making you sell
this place?

152
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,006
Not at all.

153
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,025
Recently, I purchased
a new cabin

154
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,660
big enough
for the whole family.

155
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:41,014
I just can't justify
owning four cabins.

156
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:43,099
Two cabins.

157
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,852
The new cabin I bought
has a great tire swing

158
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,721
for the girls, access to a lake

159
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:51,558
for all the kids to play in.

160
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,593
Plus, it doesn't have
these razor-sharp

161
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:56,713
perimeter defense planks
sticking out of the ground.

162
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,616
I usually get a 5% commission,
but I'll do it for 3%.

163
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,584
Friends and family discount.

164
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:02,068
Make it 5%.

165
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:04,721
I don't want you getting any
ideas about us being friends.

166
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:06,389
- Respect.
- Donna, baby.

167
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,608
For the fireplace,
I'm thinking fake antlers.

168
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,210
But what kind of scarves
do we want to hang

169
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,578
off the fake antlers?

170
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,730
- Oh, duh. Crocheted.
- Most def.

171
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:16,215
That'll look legit next to those
antique "Visit France" posters.

172
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:18,568
Mm.

173
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:19,953
Ron, you want to stay outside

174
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:20,987
and do nothing while they make

175
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,038
your cabin look like garbage?

176
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,523
I'd like that very much.

177
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,692
We can watch the shadows
get longer.

178
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,327
Okay.

179
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:29,129
Wow, you guys sure take

180
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:31,348
the start-up paperwork
seriously around here.

181
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:33,516
Sorry to start you out
like this,

182
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:35,068
and on a Friday no less.

183
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,037
But it's our toughest case.

184
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:41,074
Three competing family trusts,
a contested will...

185
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:44,427
it's a real puzzler!

186
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,783
So let's see
what you got, genius.

187
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:51,067
If I'm murdered tonight,

188
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:54,220
start the investigation
with those two guys.

189
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,197
The hell you nerds doing here?

190
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,915
We're not done talking
about the lockbox.

191
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,066
This isn't over.

192
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:09,369
And I am here to mediate.

193
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,288
You can't just show up
at my door like this.

194
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,756
Look, I know we have had
our differences,

195
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,174
but this is very important
to me.

196
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,960
And I'm not leaving
until we hash this out.

197
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,178
I respect the moxie, Knope.

198
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:19,629
You can come in for a minute.

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,931
Shoes off.
This is a house of respect.

200
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:23,433
Well, I don't need to do that.
My feet are very clean.

201
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,468
No shoes, you lose.

202
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,936
"No shoes, you lose"?

203
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:29,022
That means we should have shoes
then, right?

204
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:31,958
No shoes...

205
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,344
Hmm.

206
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:37,030
Yeah, so this is
my weekend dojo.

207
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:39,098
Sorry, the place
is a bit of a mess.

208
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:41,067
My wife's in Oklahoma
for eight months.

209
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:44,220
Maybe forever.
We'll see if she forgives me.

210
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,906
- Who's that, Michelle Wie?
- It's not sexual.

211
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,074
I'm just a really big fan
of her game.

212
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:49,659
- Really?
- Yeah.

213
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,711
Because in that picture,
she's wearing a bikini.

214
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:54,130
Yeah, thanks.
Photoshopped it myself.

215
00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:55,131
Fantastic.

216
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,132
Well, this is about the time

217
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,550
I hit the hay, so...

218
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,135
Why don't we all hit the hay?

219
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,720
We'll stay here,
get a good night's sleep,

220
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:02,756
and we can start negotiations
tomorrow.

221
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,225
We stopped at the outlet mall
on the way here.

222
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,095
Got ourselves a sleeping bag,
a giant tin of caramel corn,

223
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:12,399
and an irregular skirt
from DKNY.

224
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:14,133
The hem is crooked,
but it was 8 bucks.

225
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:17,020
The point is, I am not leaving
until I get that lockbox.

226
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:18,438
Oh, playing hardball, huh?

227
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:20,073
Hey, no sweat off my sack.

228
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:21,474
You can take the couch,

229
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:23,326
if you can get
my exercise equipment

230
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:26,312
out of the way.

231
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,281
I think I can handle it.

232
00:08:35,547 --> 00:08:37,627
How sweet is this table,
by the way, huh?

233
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,675
I got it
from an actual benihana.

234
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:42,519
Cost me 4 grand.
Worth every penny.

235
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:43,520
Hai!

236
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,604
Can I interest anyone

237
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:47,457
in an authentic
a-Japanese a-break-a-fast?

238
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,893
Scrambled eggs eaten
with chopsticks? Okay.

239
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:51,228
Hai!

240
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,812
You know,
maybe we should negotiate

241
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,331
- while we're eating.
- No, what's the rush?

242
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,666
Plenty of time for that later.

243
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:58,852
You know what might put you
in the mood to talk is

244
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,570
a couple of brewskis

245
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:03,323
and a calendar featuring

246
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,925
some of your favorite
female wrestlers.

247
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,828
Oh, yeah.

248
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:09,529
Knope, you know the way
to a man's heart.

249
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:10,931
Yeah, okay.
Let's talk.

250
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:12,182
You got it.

251
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:13,867
These people won't leave.

252
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,935
One guy even looked
in the bathroom.

253
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:17,537
Yeah, that means
they like the place.

254
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:19,089
If you just leave them alone,

255
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:21,007
I think we might get
some offers.

256
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,275
This evergreen scented candle
should help put people

257
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:23,694
in the mood to buy.

258
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:25,128
You could just open the door

259
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:27,147
and let the actual smell
of the pines in.

260
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,200
Trees are sticky,
and they got bugs in them.

261
00:09:32,954 --> 00:09:35,689
This place is so random.

262
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:38,191
I don't know. It's kind of,
like, in the middle of nowhere.

263
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,377
I know. That's,
like, the hilarious part.

264
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,827
It's like a joke
how long it takes to get here.

265
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:44,201
It's like a meta-cabin.

266
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:46,505
- Oh yeah.
- That's what I thought, yeah.

267
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,882
I heard that Dave Eggers
wrote a short story

268
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,604
about this tape cassette
that he found

269
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,671
under that tree over there.

270
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:53,607
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

271
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,974
I'm trying to get
these annoying dumdums

272
00:09:54,992 --> 00:09:56,360
to pay more money
for your cabin.

273
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:58,095
Carry on.

274
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,796
Oh, my God, I heard that

275
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:01,881
Neko Case and Ben Gibbard
made out here once.

276
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:04,368
What?

277
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,837
Saturday at the firm with Ben.

278
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:08,972
Okay, we dissolve
the loan-out

279
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,323
and file bankruptcy.

280
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:12,693
That way only our clients
have claim to the assets.

281
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:15,128
Great idea...

282
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,114
that we had a month ago.

283
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:19,416
The problem is,
the trust still has claim

284
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,468
to the property.

285
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:24,438
Then we dissolve the trust.

286
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:28,041
Clients "A,"B," and "F,"
they would have to agree,

287
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:30,127
but if they went for it,
we could arbitrate.

288
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:31,561
He's right.

289
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:34,448
We never thought of that.

290
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:36,583
Oh, oh!
Ben, Ben.

291
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:39,919
Say it again but this time
I'm gonna turn the light on,

292
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:41,354
like you just had an idea.

293
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:42,722
Sure, sure.
Yeah, I'm with you.

294
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,342
Um, okay.

295
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:48,528
What if we dissolve the trust?

296
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:50,981
Yes!
You just cracked the case.

297
00:10:51,032 --> 00:10:52,249
I'm just doing my job.

298
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,218
Okay, here's an idea.

299
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:57,036
Maybe we name part of the park

300
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,989
- the "Jamm Zone"?
- Hmm.

301
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:00,490
Yeah, Jamm could dig on that.

302
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:02,242
How about if in the Jamm zone,

303
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:03,627
there's no married chicks
allowed?

304
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:05,044
Caution, Jeremy.

305
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:06,263
I think there are people
that will find

306
00:11:06,314 --> 00:11:07,914
the "No Married Chicks" zone

307
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:09,649
both morally repugnant
and hard to enforce.

308
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,667
All right.

309
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:13,136
Listen, let us celebrate
this progress

310
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:17,707
by sharing
these authentic edamame,

311
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:19,859
or Tokyo beans.

312
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,194
Now I want you
to be very careful

313
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:22,429
about eating these.

314
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:24,815
You eat the shells,
and you throw the seeds out.

315
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,067
Wow. You have really immersed
yourself in Asian culture.

316
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:28,885
Now I think maybe
we should revisit

317
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,170
the holding bond idea.

318
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:31,749
Ugh, Lezzie.
Come on, I'm getting bored.

319
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:33,323
I mean, we've been
at this for hours.

320
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:34,791
Can we please take a break?

321
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:35,826
Perhaps he has a point.

322
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,427
And we've made some progress.

323
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:39,412
Maybe we go home and take
the rest of it up on Monday.

324
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,397
No, I cannot wait until Monday.

325
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:41,481
I need to close this deal now.

326
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:42,566
So I have an idea.

327
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,350
Let's have a change of venue

328
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:46,486
and keep negotiating
while we have fun.

329
00:11:46,504 --> 00:11:48,271
If I remember correctly,
you enjoy

330
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:52,108
the ancient art of karaoke,
yes?

331
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,861
I do.
And kudos on that pronunciation.

332
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,130
I remembered
your favorite duet.

333
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:59,766
Maybe it's time to take
this party to Rydell High.

334
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,151
Whoa!

335
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,936
I cannot wait to hear
your Travolta.

336
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,955
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm Sandra Dee.

337
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,706
That's more of my register.

338
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:09,226
You're Zuko.

339
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:13,163
â™ª He got friendly,
holdin' my hand â™ª

340
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:16,867
â™ª She got friendly
down in the sand â™ª

341
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:20,386
â™ª He was sweet,
just turned 18 â™ª

342
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:23,623
â™ª Well, she was good,
you know what I mean? â™ª

343
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:24,824
â™ª Uh

344
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:27,594
â™ª summer heat
boy and girl meet â™ª

345
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:31,114
â™ª but ah, oh,
those summer nights â™ª

346
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:33,166
I would like to buy five DVDs
of this.

347
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:34,417
No, 20.

348
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:35,852
No, 60!
No, that's insane.

349
00:12:35,887 --> 00:12:37,220
20.

350
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,321
â™ª Dubee doo dubee doo

351
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:40,940
â™ª dubee dubee dubee dow â™ª

352
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,592
Good news.

353
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:44,261
We have multiple bidders.

354
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:45,996
That guy's getting
his financials together.

355
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,147
Plans on tearing
the whole place down,

356
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,732
just wants it for the land.

357
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:51,184
Why would he want to tear down
a perfectly good cabin?

358
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:52,202
I think he's a developer,

359
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:54,787
wants to put in
a luxury glamp-ground.

360
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:56,523
Glamping is "glamour camping."

361
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:58,775
Heated tents,
catered meals, wi-fi...

362
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,043
You're describing a hotel.

363
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,995
And I think we still have
traction with those two.

364
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,663
Oh, hey, man.
I love the mustache.

365
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:04,965
So funny.

366
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,466
You ever think about twisting
it up at the ends, huh?

367
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:07,484
Use a little beeswax?

368
00:13:07,518 --> 00:13:09,736
The open house is now closed.

369
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,805
We are not accepting bids
at this time.

370
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,007
The sun sets in 95 minutes.

371
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,060
Good day.

372
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:20,530
That's part of the charm
of this whole place...

373
00:13:20,581 --> 00:13:22,449
the cantankerous old coot
who owns it.

374
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:23,950
It's authentic!

375
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:26,303
I gotta say,
that was pretty fun up there.

376
00:13:26,354 --> 00:13:28,905
We have fun
when we collaborate, right?

377
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,825
Working together?
Lockbox, right?

378
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,827
You know, in some weird,
perverted, sexual way,

379
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:35,862
I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone.

380
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:37,898
- Oh.
- You are my Nemesis.

381
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:39,449
You're the Superman
to my Lex Luthor.

382
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,418
You want to be Lex Luthor?

383
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:44,087
Uh, yeah.
Lex Luthor is rich.

384
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:46,389
Well, okay.
I can't argue with that.

385
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:48,892
So I did Zuko for you.

386
00:13:48,943 --> 00:13:50,543
Now you give me the lockbox.

387
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:52,979
Leslie put a beautiful cross
into the box, Jeremy.

388
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,297
Time for you to head it in.

389
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:55,749
All right, Knope.
What can I say?

390
00:13:55,783 --> 00:13:57,217
You wore me down.

391
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:00,270
I will give you my word,
and I will put it in writing,

392
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:02,022
so I can't back out.

393
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:04,724
We won't touch the money
for one year.

394
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:07,777
And if the economy holds up,
you can start construction then.

395
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,948
Leslie, you have your lockbox.

396
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,733
And you scored
a triple dragon on your song.

397
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:15,952
No, I cannot wait a year.

398
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:17,203
I want to get started now.

399
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:18,455
I want construction started
on Monday.

400
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:19,623
You have his word.

401
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:21,708
And this is riddled
with spelling errors,

402
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:23,710
- but it is binding.
- It's not good enough!

403
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:26,513
Jamm, I sang your stupid song,

404
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:28,932
I ate your stupid
fake Asian food,

405
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,249
and by the way,
you should know,

406
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,584
you don't make sushi rolls
out of tuna salad...

407
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:32,886
Maybe you don't.

408
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,638
I did practically
everything you wanted,

409
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,290
and you won't just give this
to me today?

410
00:14:36,307 --> 00:14:37,857
Screw you!

411
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:41,379
- You're giving a card to me?
- You left me no choice.

412
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:43,730
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Please, could you excuse us?

413
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:46,903
Leslie, you should be happy!

414
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:49,110
You beat Jamm
in the final battle.

415
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:52,897
Unless there's something more
going on here.

416
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,198
Ann.
This is about Ann.

417
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,834
Ann Perkins?
I love Ann Perkins.

418
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:59,237
Pawnee Commons is why
I met Ann five years ago.

419
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,789
And I know you guys are
talking about moving.

420
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:03,508
But I guess I thought
if maybe Ann came back

421
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,110
from Michigan tomorrow,
and I was able to look

422
00:15:05,144 --> 00:15:08,146
into her smoky,
ethnically ambiguous eyes

423
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:09,915
and tell her that we were
breaking ground

424
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:12,550
on a new park,
she might...

425
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:15,353
- she might want to stay.
- Leslie, I'm sorry.

426
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:18,139
Ann didn't just go
to Ann arbor to visit family.

427
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,025
She went to sign the lease
on our new home.

428
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:22,310
Ann arbor sounds disgusting.

429
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:24,195
She already has family there.

430
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,590
And I have a new job lined up
at the University of Michigan.

431
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,984
Go blue!

432
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,201
It's a good town.

433
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,703
And it's a great place
to raise a family.

434
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:34,038
What is great about it?
There's no JJ's Diner there.

435
00:15:34,056 --> 00:15:36,140
There's no
"Welcome to Pawnee" sign.

436
00:15:36,158 --> 00:15:37,709
I mean, the stupid state

437
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:39,127
is split up into two pieces!

438
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:40,128
It's ridiculous.

439
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:41,746
Unexpected play here, Superman.

440
00:15:41,764 --> 00:15:43,465
Not exactly sure
what you're going for,

441
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:44,515
but I dig your Gambit.

442
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,584
There is no Gambit here, Jamm.

443
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:49,921
And who sides
with Lex Luthor, by the way?

444
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,856
You probably watch
Million Dollar Baby

445
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:52,857
and root for the stool.

446
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:53,842
I haven't seen it.

447
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:55,760
Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.

448
00:15:55,795 --> 00:15:58,179
I find his voice very grating.

449
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,081
I am leaving now.
I am not moving.

450
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:01,282
I'm just going home.

451
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:02,550
Are you guys coming back
to my place?

452
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:04,653
What's... what's...
or are you guys going back to...

453
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:07,205
we wrapping up the weekend?

454
00:16:08,741 --> 00:16:09,975
No?

455
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:13,144
â™ª Need a cup to perk me up

456
00:16:13,178 --> 00:16:15,280
â™ª coffee in the morning

457
00:16:15,314 --> 00:16:17,415
- Surprise!
- Oh, my God!

458
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,485
I hope you don't mind.

459
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,220
We decided to throw you
a pizza party

460
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:24,589
to say congrats
for cracking the case.

461
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,958
Oh, my God, you guys.

462
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,143
See what we got here.

463
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,145
Wait a second.
That's not pizza.

464
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:31,329
Those are calzones!

465
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:34,933
- I love calzones!
- We know!

466
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:38,787
I think it's safe to say
I made the right choice.

467
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:39,937
What's up, guys?

468
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:43,508
Hey!

469
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:55,837
BFF slideshow?

470
00:16:55,871 --> 00:16:57,505
You know that
even after we leave Pawnee,

471
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,007
Ann will always be
your best friend.

472
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,659
And it's not that long a trip.

473
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:02,854
Well, it would be even faster

474
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:04,412
if the governor would return
my calls

475
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:07,331
about my Pawnee-to-Ann arbor
bullet train idea.

476
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,109
You know, I went
to Jamm's with you because

477
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:12,537
I also want to leave
the right kind of legacy,

478
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:14,672
and that includes
Pawnee commons.

479
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,174
Well, I think
I burned that bridge with Jamm.

480
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:17,609
We're not gonna get
that lockbox.

481
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:20,161
And I am not singing
Beauty School Dropout.

482
00:17:20,212 --> 00:17:22,814
It's sexist,
and I don't do slow jams.

483
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:24,265
I have an idea.

484
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:27,351
And I'd like you to consider it

485
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,504
a good-bye gift
from me to you.

486
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:34,576
No, thank you.
I will let him know.

487
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,244
That was that couple you liked
at the open house.

488
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:37,545
I despised them.

489
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:39,764
Well, they just came back
with a new offer

490
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,317
and jacked that shizz up.

491
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:44,035
Way over asking price.

492
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,488
Ron, who cares who they are?
That's a massive bid.

493
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:47,889
I'ma be a mogul.

494
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:50,708
I bought that cabin
18 years ago for $2,200.

495
00:17:50,726 --> 00:17:52,193
I do not care about the money.

496
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:54,162
I can't even understand
what you're saying right now.

497
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:56,548
That cabin served
an important purpose for me,

498
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:59,734
as a quiet refuge from
the nonsense of modern life.

499
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:01,385
I'd like the next owners
to understand

500
00:18:01,403 --> 00:18:03,020
and share that purpose.

501
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,207
Find me someone like that,
and I'll happily sell.

502
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:07,509
I'll buy it.

503
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,760
You can't afford that house.

504
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:10,979
Can you afford that house?

505
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,614
What would you use it for?

506
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:16,201
I'd go up there
and take Andy and Champion

507
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:17,952
and just get away
from everyone else

508
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:19,020
and look at spiders.

509
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,738
And it's where I'd bury
the bodies

510
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:22,524
of that annoying couple
after I murder them.

511
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:23,941
Here's my offer.

512
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:27,679
I will give you everything
in my purse.

513
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:31,516
$8, a bunch
of loose cough drops,

514
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:34,002
and Larry's asthma inhaler.

515
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:35,670
Thank God.
I've been looking for that.

516
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,755
Larry, this is part of
a real estate transaction now.

517
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:39,224
You have no legal claim to it.

518
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:41,893
Sorry, I had no idea.

519
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,345
This is the best offer
I've heard yet.

520
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,347
Uh, you tripping right now.

521
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:47,465
Sold.

522
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:48,783
Don't even trip.

523
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:50,101
Your commission.

524
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:54,005
Thanks a lot.

525
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,040
Your share, mogul.

526
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:57,592
I'm about to play golf
with a guy

527
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,394
who was almost
on The Apprentice,

528
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:00,628
so this better be good.

529
00:19:00,663 --> 00:19:02,981
You give Leslie her lockbox,

530
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,616
and you get me
in your hip pocket.

531
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,168
Starting in my next term
as city manager,

532
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:11,639
I will give you
one huge I.O.U.,

533
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,625
no questions asked.

534
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:14,626
Hmm.

535
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,046
Jamm likes the sound of that.

536
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,182
Let's make it five I.O.U.s,
and you got a deal.

537
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:25,270
You drive a hard bargain,
but you leave me no choice.

538
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:28,156
Fine.
Five huge IOUs.

539
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,307
Deal, guys.

540
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:30,992
You must really want that park.

541
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:32,110
I do. Yes.

542
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:34,329
And to tell you the truth,

543
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:36,364
I'm doing it all
for my best friend.

544
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:38,516
That's all I wanted to hear.

545
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:41,315
Leslie,
you're my best friend too.

546
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:47,261
Well, vote passed. 3-2.

547
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:49,785
Jamm is gonna be so pissed
when he finds out

548
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:50,611
that you're leaving

549
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,971
and your I.O.U.s are worthless.

550
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:53,119
Are you sure you're okay
with what you did?

551
00:19:53,153 --> 00:19:55,121
Well, it's not
the most ethical thing

552
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:56,423
that I've ever done,

553
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:58,324
but on the flip side,
Jamm is a big, mean dope.

554
00:19:58,342 --> 00:19:59,659
- Mm-hmm.
- And I hope that this eases

555
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:01,478
some of the pain of us
moving away a little bit.

556
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:02,612
Oh, I'm currently
in deep denial

557
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:03,930
that that's happening.

558
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:06,216
Speaking of which,
how's the new gig coming?

559
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:07,267
Well, I got a raise,

560
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:08,935
and my fridge is full
of calzones,

561
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,336
so not complaining.

562
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:11,721
The reason I ask is
this town is gonna need

563
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:13,172
a new city manager.

564
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:14,558
And I've talked to some people,

565
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:17,777
and you have the votes
if you want the job.

566
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:19,896
Wh...

567
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:20,981
Seriously?

568
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:22,015
Is this for realskis?

569
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:24,985
This is 100% certified
for realskis.

570
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:27,537
- What do you say?
- I mean, I... wow.

571
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:29,489
I would be insane to say no.

572
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:31,024
Oh, no.

573
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:34,628
Wyatt, you're late.

574
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,999
I'm just kidding,
you can do whatever you want.

575
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:41,167
Actually, Barney,

576
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:44,204
I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

577
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:46,122
Today's my last day.

578
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:48,375
I got an opportunity
I couldn't say no to,

579
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:50,544
and I have to quit.
Again.

580
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:53,630
No need to explain.

581
00:20:53,664 --> 00:20:56,249
I knew it was too good
to be true.

582
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:59,636
Oh, I do have
a little going-away gift.

583
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,005
Left it in the break room.

584
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,507
If anyone could appreciate it,
it's you guys.

585
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,060
"You can play with one warrior,

586
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:08,795
"but it's just
not nearly as good.

587
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:11,348
Enjoy.
Ben Wyatt."

588
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:12,349
Let's play.

589
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,133
- I call ledgerman!
- No.

590
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:20,699
