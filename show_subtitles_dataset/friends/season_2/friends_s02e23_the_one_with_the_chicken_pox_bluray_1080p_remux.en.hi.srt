00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,592
I can't say.

340
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,553
Well, do you get to look through
one of those periscope thingies?

341
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,722
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

342
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,850
Wow, it's neat learning
about submarines.

343
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,478
I better get out of here.
I'm gonna miss my flight.

344
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,854
Okay, I'll walk you out.

- Pleasure. Take care.

So do you, uh, think we could get you
one of those uniform things?

Okay.

350
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,127
Can you believe that's how
we spent our two weeks?

351
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,171
We didn't do the romantic
things I'd planned...

352
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:02,009
...like having a picnic in Central Park
and, you know, a coffee at Central Perk.

353
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,719
Oh, I just got that.

00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,647
