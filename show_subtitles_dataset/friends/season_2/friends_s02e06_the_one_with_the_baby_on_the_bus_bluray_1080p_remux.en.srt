1
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,960
Who the winny-binny boy?

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,560
You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
Don't cry.

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,360
Don't cry.

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,760
Why is he still crying?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,960
Let me hold him for a sec.

7
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,560
Here we go.

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,080
There we are.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,560
Maybe it's me.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,520
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.
He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,240
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,720
There we go, all better.

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,360
There's my little boy.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,760
Can I see something?

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,360
Cool!

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,000
He hates me.
My nephew hates me!

18
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,400
Come on, don't do this.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
What if my own baby hates me?
What do I do then?

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,920
Monica, stop! This is nuts.

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,560
Do you know how long it'll be
before you have to deal with this?

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,760
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
Joey, she does not look fat.

24
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
The One With the Baby on the Bus

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,520
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Here you go.

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,760
Goo, goo, goo!

28
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,600
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec.

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,240
You okay?

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,160
I don't know.

31
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,240
What's in this pie?

32
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know. Butter and eggs
and flour and lime and kiwi...

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,720
Kiwi? Kiwi?

34
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,360
You said it was a key lime pie.

35
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,360
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime.
That's what makes it so special.

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,960
That's what's gonna kill me.

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,920
I'm allergic to kiwi.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,160
No, you're not. You're allergic
to lobster and peanuts and...

39
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,040
Oh, my God!

40
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,560
It's definitely getting worse.

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,560
Is your tongue swelling up?

42
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,840
Either that or my mouth
is getting smaller!

43
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,160
Get your coat.
We're going to the hospital.

44
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,520
- Will he be okay?
- He's gotta get a shot.

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,920
You know, actually,
it's getting better. It is.

46
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,360
Let's not go.
Anyone up for Scrabble?

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,480
Jacket, now!

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,360
What about Ben? We can't
bring a baby to the hospital.

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,280
We'll watch him.

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,960
I don't think so.

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,560
I have seven Catholic sisters.
I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
Come on, we want to do it.
Don't we?

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,840
I was gonna play basketball...

54
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,840
but I guess that's out the window.

55
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,040
If you take him out for a walk,
remember to bring his hat.

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
There's milk in the refrigerator
and diapers in the bag.

57
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,520
Hat, milk...

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,000
Got it!

59
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,280
Consider it done!

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
You understood?

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,760
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,760
Is he the one
with the beautiful wife?

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,480
You want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
I wrote it this morning in the shower.

65
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,960
I'm in the shower
And I'm writing a song

66
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Stop me if you've heard it

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,640
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,360
And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget

69
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,960
Rachel, sweetheart,
could I see you for a minute?

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,640
What's up?

71
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,520
FYl:

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,720
I've decided to pay a professional
musician to play here on Sundays.

73
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,920
Her name is Stephanie something.
She's supposed to be very good.

74
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,760
But what about Phoebe?

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,280
It's not that your friend is bad.

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,960
It's that she's so bad...

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,520
she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

78
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,800
and swirl it around.

79
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
Okay, so you're not a fan.

80
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,760
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

81
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,560
I have to do this to her?

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
Lather, rinse, repeat

83
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,120
And lather, rinse, repeat

84
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,680
And lather, rinse, repeat

85
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,000
As needed

86
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,520
We didn't bring enough stuff.

87
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,160
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anvil?

88
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,520
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.

89
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,120
It's a known fact
that women love babies.

90
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,560
Women love guys who love babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

91
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,960
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one of them will break away.

92
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,320
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard left.

93
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,320
- Give me the baby.
- No, I got him.

94
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Come on, seriously.

95
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,160
Oh, seriously, you want him?

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,880
Who is this little cutie-pie?

97
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,680
Well, don't think me immodest, but...

98
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,440
me.

99
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,560
Want to smell him?

100
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,280
I assume we're talking about the baby?

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,000
He's got that great baby smell.
Get a whiff of his head.

102
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
My uterus just skipped a beat.

103
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
What'd I tell you?

104
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,640
It's great you're doing this.

105
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
Well, we are great guys.

106
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,960
My brother and his boyfriend
have been trying to adopt.

107
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,960
What agency did you two go through?

108
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,440
But this is my gig.

109
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,040
This is where I play.

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,640
My name is written out there in chalk.

111
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,960
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

112
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,920
Honey, I'm sorry.

113
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,320
And he's going to
be paying this woman?

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,320
Why doesn't he just give her
a throne and a crown?

115
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,840
And, like, a gold stick
with a ball on top?

116
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,520
Terry is a jerk! That's why
we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"

117
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,560
That's where that came from.

118
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,120
You probably did everything you could.

119
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,560
You know what? Let me just
see what else I could do.

120
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Just let her go on after
Stephanie whatever her name is.

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,520
You won't be here.
You don't pay her.

122
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,960
I don't know.

123
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,960
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

124
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,920
You don't clean
the cappuccino machine?

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,720
Of course I clean it.

126
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,520
I mean, I will clean it.

127
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,240
I mean, I will clean it.

128
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,720
All right, fine, fine, fine!

129
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
- Done.
- Really?

130
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,520
Who's working for you, babe?

131
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,160
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
How much am I gonna get?

132
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,840
What?

133
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,080
He's paying the people
who were playing.

134
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,240
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professional.

135
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,720
I'm not gonna be the only one
who's not getting paid.

136
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm sorry, no!

137
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,680
No, I'm not some sloppy second,
you know, charity band.

138
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,320
There are thousands of places
in this city...

139
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,120
where people would pay
to hear me play.

140
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,160
When I play, I play for me

141
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,320
I don't need your charity

142
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,360
Thank you!

143
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm not getting a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle...

144
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,080
and squirt it into my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

145
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,720
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,520
I see someone's having
a little allergic reaction.

147
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,560
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

148
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,720
My brother has
a slight phobia about needles.

149
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,160
Did you tell him
about my squirt gun idea?

150
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,520
My brother, the Ph.D.,
would like to know...

151
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,840
if there's any way
to treat this orally?

152
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,880
Under these circumstances, it has to be
an injection, and it has to be now.

153
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,760
So?

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,360
Go and have a seat. The doctor
says it's got to be a needle.

155
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,560
You're just going to have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

156
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,400
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.

157
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,160
You want to squeeze my hand?

158
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,320
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

159
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,960
Honey, really.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

160
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,320
Let go of my hand!

161
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,680
Good plan. Next time
we want to pick up women...

162
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,560
we should go to
the park and make out.

163
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,720
Taxi! Taxi!

164
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,080
Look at that talent.

165
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,840
Just practicing. You're good.

166
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,760
Carry on.

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,880
Wait, wait, wait!

168
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Hey, you. He's just adorable.

169
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,880
Can you tell him that?
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

170
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,560
- What are you guys out doing today?
- We're not out.

171
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,520
We're two heterosexual guys
hanging with the son...

172
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,880
of our other heterosexual friend,
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

173
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,240
You done?

174
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,920
There's our stop.

175
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,680
Get out of here!
This is our stop.

176
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,760
You guys live around here too?

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,160
We live in the building
by the sidewalk.

178
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,320
You know it?

179
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,920
Since we're neighbors, what do you say
we get together for a drink?

180
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,920
So you want to go to Markel's?

181
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,040
Sure, they love us over there.

182
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,960
Where's your baby?

183
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,960
Ben! Ben!

184
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,520
That's good. Maybe he'll
hear you and pull the cord!

185
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,560
Stop the bus!

186
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,840
Are you sure he didn't break it?
It hurts.

187
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,760
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,440
And right here is
the puncture wound from your ring.

189
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,240
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

190
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,960
Sorry.

191
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,960
Sorry! I got my S's back!

192
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,080
Which we can celebrate later.

193
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,160
Celebrate. Celebrate...

194
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,120
He was a double, double

195
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,560
Double-jointed boy

196
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,960
So are you the
professional guitar player?

197
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,040
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

198
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,400
Right. My name was on there,
but now it just says carrot cake.

199
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,520
So how many chords do you know?

200
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,440
- All of them.
- So you know D?

201
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,640
Do you know A-minor?

202
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Do you know how to go
from D to A-minor?

203
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,960
So does your guitar have a strap?

204
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,000
Mine does.

205
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,720
Stephanie knows all the chords

206
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,960
Come on! Pick up, pick up!

207
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,240
Transit Authority?

208
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,040
I'm doing research for a book.

209
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,720
I was wondering what somebody might do
if they left a baby on a city bus.

210
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,520
Yes, I realize that would be
a stupid character.

211
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,240
Here's the deal:
We lost a car seat on a bus.

212
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,720
It's white plastic and
it fits onto a stroller.

213
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,760
And there was a baby in it.

214
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,680
He wants to talk to you.

215
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,320
Everybody, let's give a warm
Central Perk welcome to...

216
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,240
Terry's a jerk
And he won't let me work

217
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
And I hate Central Perk

218
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,560
To Stephanie Schiffer!

219
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,760
I'd like to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever loved.

220
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,920
Zachary...

221
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,360
Are all invited to bite me

222
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,720
We're the guys that called
about the baby! Is he here?

223
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,960
He's here.

224
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,520
I assume one of you is the father.

225
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,560
- That's me.
- I'm him.

226
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,160
Actually, we're both the father.

227
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,080
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.

228
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,560
Please tell me you know
which one is our baby.

229
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,520
That one has ducks on his T-shirt
and this one has clowns.

230
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,720
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

231
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,000
Or clowns.

232
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,680
That one's Ben! Remember he had
that cute little mole by his mouth!

233
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,040
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

234
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,200
Okay, the mole came off.

235
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,360
What are we gonna do?

236
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,320
We'll flip for it.
Ducks or clowns.

237
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,640
- Flip for the baby?
- You got a better idea?

238
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,880
All right, call it in the air.

239
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,160
Heads.

240
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,040
Heads, it is.

241
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,920
We have to assign heads to something!

242
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,960
Right!

243
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,160
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

244
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,760
What kind of scary-ass clowns
came to your birthday?

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

246
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,920
Just touch my cheek
Before you leave me, baby

247
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,600
Just call me angel
Of the morning, angel

248
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,240
Then slowly turn away

249
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,120
I won't beg you to stay

250
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,160
With me

251
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,120
Here. I thought you might be cold.

252
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,960
Thank you.

253
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,040
Look at you!
You did pretty well.

254
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,040
$8.27.

255
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,640
But not really, because
I put in the first two.

256
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,240
Just to get the ball rolling
and to make myself feel better.

257
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,000
Do you?

258
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,760
You know, this whole playing
for money thing is so not good for me.

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,080
I don't know, when I
sang "Su-su-suicide"...

260
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,920
I got, like, $ 1.75.

261
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,400
But then "Smelly Cat"?

262
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,960
I got 25 cents and a condom.

263
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,960
So, you know, now I just feel
really bad for "Smelly Cat".

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,920
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets "Smelly Cat".

265
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,520
I mean, if all you've ever actually
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

266
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,120
But it's not even that, you know?

267
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,040
I used to do my songs
because it made me happy.

268
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,480
Now it's just all
about the money, you know?

269
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,640
Well, people missed you in there.

270
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,080
In fact, there was actually
a request for "Smelly Cat".

271
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,040
Really? From who?

272
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,920
Well, me.

273
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,560
And I know it's not your big
money song, but it's my favorite.

274
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,960
Did I accidentally drop
a condom in your case?

275
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,120
It's kind of an emergency.

276
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,720
- Here you go.
- Thanks a lot.

277
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,520
Hey, Christine! I got it!

278
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,840
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

279
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,320
And I'm sorry
I almost broke your hand.

280
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,840
That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

281
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,320
Remember the time I jammed
that pencil into your hand?

282
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,360
Remember it? What do
you think this is, a freckle?

283
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,240
What about the time I hit you
in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?

284
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,920
Remember when I stuck
that broom in your spokes...

285
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,760
and you hit your head on the curb?

286
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,560
But I remember
people telling me about it.

287
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,240
I hope Ben has a little sister.

288
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,880
And I hope she can kick his ass.

289
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

290
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,920
How about the time I cut
the legs off your Malibu Ken?

291
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,880
That was you?

292
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,280
They were infected.
He wouldn't have made it.

293
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,120
My little nephew.

294
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,480
Come here, little one!

295
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,960
There's my little baby, Ben!

296
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,000
Hey, he's not crying!

297
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,960
Hey, he's not crying!

298
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,920
There's still pie!

299
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm here. I'm here.

300
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,160
How's my little boy?

301
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,920
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

302
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,560
Did you have fun with Uncle Joey
and Uncle Chandler today?

303
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,560
He rode the bus today.

304
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,960
Big boy riding the bus...

305
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,360
Hey, I have a question.

306
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,760
How come it says,
"Property of Human Services"?

307
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,080
You are gonna love this.

308
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,360
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

309
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,520
Come here. Come here.

310
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,160
Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

311
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,920
Smelly cat, smelly cat

312
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,720
What are they feeding you?

313
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,920
No, no. I'm sorry, it's:

314
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,640
Smelly cat, smelly cat

315
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,320
Smelly cat, smelly cat

316
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,520
Better!

317
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,720
Much better. Good.

318
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't feel bad,
because it's a hard song.

319
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,920
- You want to try it again?
- From the top?

320
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,120
There is no "top", all right?

321
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,840
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat".

322
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,200
Why don't you just follow me.

323
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,840
Smelly cat, smelly cat

324
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,120
What are they feeding you?

325
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,320
Smelly cat, smelly cat

326
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,040
It's not your fault

327
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,960
That's too much. Sorry.
