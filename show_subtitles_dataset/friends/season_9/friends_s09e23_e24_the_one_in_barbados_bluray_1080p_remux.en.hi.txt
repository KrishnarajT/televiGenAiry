1
00:00:06,258 --> 00:00:08,926
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.

2
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:13,265
That's right. Daddy and Uncle Joey
are going on a trip today.

3
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:18,060
We're going to a conference in Barbados.
Right? Can you say, "Barbados"?

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,188
Barbados.

5
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:26,194
Okay. I've gotta say, it means so much
to me that you guys are coming...

6
00:00:26,403 --> 00:00:29,072
all the way over there
to hear me give my speech.

7
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:32,159
And I have a surprise.
I had to pull some strings...

8
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:37,371
but I was able to get everyone passes
to the entire conference. That's right!

9
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:44,004
These babies will get you into all
the paleontology lectures and seminars.

10
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:48,300
Do you have anything
that will get us out of them?

11
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:52,261
We're excited to hear the speech,
but the rest of the time...

12
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,306
we're gonna want to do island stuff.

13
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:56,724
David will probably want to hear
a few lectures.

14
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,935
- Right, because he's a scientist.
- No, no.

15
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:02,855
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
If he gets too much direct sunlight...

16
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:04,774
he'll die.

17
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,817
- Okay, we'd better go.
- Yeah?

18
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,862
- So we'll see you guys tomorrow.
- All right, let's do it.

19
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,698
A five-hour flight with Charlie,
have a couple drinks...

20
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,368
get under that blanket
and do what comes natural.

21
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:18,788
It's a blanket, Joe,
not a cloak of invisibility.

22
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,584
The One In Barbados

25
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:21,768
- Wow, this place is beautiful!
- Look at all these paleontologists!

26
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:26,356
I know. There are gonna be some
pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.

27
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,651
- My God, I can't believe you're here!
- I think I've been recognized.

28
00:02:30,861 --> 00:02:35,114
- This happens all the time.
- Dr. Geller? I am such a huge fan.

29
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,701
That never happens.

30
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:42,288
I've been following your career for years.
I can't wait for your keynote speech.

31
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,876
- Wow! This is very flattering.
- I would love your autograph.

32
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,213
Well, sure.

33
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,256
- "Dear...?"
- Sarah.

34
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:57,679
"Sarah. I dig you."

35
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,934
- "Dr. Ross Geller."
- Oh, thank you so much.

36
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:06,355
Sure. Sarah, I'd like you to introduce you
to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.

37
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:10,525
- And this is Joey Tribbiani.
- Are you a paleontologist?

38
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,987
No, God, no, no.
I'm an actor.

39
00:03:14,196 --> 00:03:17,990
You probably recognize me from a
little show called "The Days of Our Lives."

40
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:22,787
Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives."
There's no "the."

41
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:30,546
Okay, Ross. Boy, you... Yeah.
No, no. I play Dr. Drake Ramoray.

42
00:03:43,225 --> 00:03:44,600
David, can you help me?

43
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,230
I'm trying to explain to Chandler
how a plane stays in the air.

44
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:51,191
Certainly. That's a combination
of Bernoulli's Principle...

45
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,194
and Newton's third law of motion.
- See?

46
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:58,030
Yeah. That's the same as,
"It has something to do with wind."

47
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,118
I'm gonna go pick up a few things
for the trip.

48
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:05,162
I should go too. Now, tomorrow do you
want to share a cab to the airport...

49
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,957
or should Mike and I meet you?

50
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,506
Mike? Who's Mike?

51
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:18,593
- Mike's your ex-boyfriend.
- That's right!

52
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:22,472
Oh, yeah.
Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.

53
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:28,561
- That's a blast from the past, huh?
- No, it's okay. Honest mistake.

54
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,480
It really doesn't mean anything.
I mean, you know...

55
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,650
Monica refers to Chandler as Richard
all the time.

56
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,948
- She does?
- Let's get you out of here.

57
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:48,040
Well, at least you took me down
with you.

58
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,792
I'm so sorry. I just...
I keep thinking about Mike.

59
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:55,756
I'm crazy about David, and
we're having so much fun together.

60
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:00,093
Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just...
That's gonna go away, right?

61
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:02,304
- Well, I guess. In time.
- Yeah.

62
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:05,432
I mean, my feelings for Richard
are certainly gone.

63
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:11,188
You just did it again. Chandler. Your
feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.

64
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,734
Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up
on that Mike, huh?

65
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:18,946
I wouldn't read too much into it.

66
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,323
Still, a girl calls you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...

67
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:25,535
that's not a good thing, right?
- Let me stop you there.

68
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:30,374
Because I think I see where this is going.
I'm not very good at giving advice.

69
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,417
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...

70
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:38,924
for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.

71
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:44,388
I'm sorry, I just wish there
was something I could do, you know?

72
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:48,225
- Well, you know Phoebe...
- Seriously, we're gonna do this?

73
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:52,061
I'm sorry, I just wish I could make her
forget about Mike already.

74
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:57,066
- Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
- Because his penis was too big.

75
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:04,366
I'm sorry. That's the kind of thing I do.

76
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,494
They broke up because Mike
didn't want to get married.

77
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:11,247
What if you let Phoebe know
you'd be open to marriage?

78
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:15,669
That's great. That's great.
I'll propose to her.

79
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,295
What?

80
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,881
I was probably going to do it
at some point.

81
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:22,800
- No, I didn't mean now.
- Well, why not? It's brilliant.

82
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,888
"Goodbye, Mike.
We'll see you at the wedding, fella.

83
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,932
Well, we probably won't invite you
to the wedding, but..."

84
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:32,643
- Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
- Well, you're welcome.

85
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:34,770
Glad I could help.

86
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:39,318
- How do you think I should propose?
- I'm pretending to read here.

87
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,153
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:47,576
Yeah. How you doing?
Hey, how are you?

89
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,831
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?

90
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:58,337
I didn't mean a thong.
I meant thongs.

91
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,006
You really should have been
more clear about that.

92
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,472
You're never gonna guess
who I just saw downstairs.

93
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:11,891
Britney Spears!

94
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,977
Yeah.
She never misses these conferences.

95
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,732
- No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
- Oh, my God!

96
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,484
- I know!
- Did you talk to him?

97
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,903
Oh, yeah. What am I gonna say
to Kenneth Schwartz?

98
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:28,242
You could say, "Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?"

99
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,244
- You ready to go?
- You're gonna go now?

100
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:35,249
- I thought we could hang out.
- I can't. I have seminars all day.

101
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,542
I promised Ross
I'd look at his speech.

102
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:43,840
But maybe we could have dinner later?
Out on the balcony? Lt'll be romantic.

103
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,218
Will you wear a thong?

104
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:48,177
I will if you will.

105
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,140
You got yourself a very weird deal.

106
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:57,145
I'm good. I have dinner plans.

107
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,648
- So you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

108
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:04,903
I got tons of stuff I could do.
I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.

109
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,864
Joe, have you looked outside?

110
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,448
No. Why?

111
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,537
- Oh, man.
- There's an indoor pool.

112
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,290
- You could swim there.
- Yeah.

113
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:20,001
I wasn't gonna swim.
I was gonna dig a hole.

114
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:27,550
That Mike thing was interesting.
I don't know what's gonna happen...

115
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:32,347
with Phoebe and David.
- I do. Want a hint, huh?

116
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,141
I do.

117
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,852
I do.

118
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:41,231
Okay, I'm sensing this is
some kind of wordplay...

119
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,483
because you are pink
with barely controlled glee.

120
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:49,698
- David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
- What? Why?

121
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:53,242
Because we were talking about ways
he could beat Mike...

122
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:55,703
and I told him Phoebe wanted
to get married.

123
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,831
Chandler, we have talked about this.

124
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,001
You are not supposed to give
people advice!

125
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:05,255
Couldn't you have made
some inappropriate joke?

126
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,966
I did! A penis one!

127
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:10,886
Just so I know, what was so wrong
about what I said?

128
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,304
They've only been going out
for a few weeks.

129
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:17,851
Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
I mean, she'll say no...

130
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:21,604
David's heart will be broken,
it'll be too hard for them to recover...

131
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,690
and then Phoebe will end up
alone again.

132
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,694
Man, that's some bad advice.

133
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,703
Oh, hey.
Thank God. You guys are here.

134
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:41,123
- What's going on?
- Everything is upside-down here.

135
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:47,213
It rains all day long and nobody
watches TV, and Ross is famous.

136
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:51,093
I don't want to alarm anybody...

137
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,804
but Monica's hair is twice as big
as it was when we landed.

138
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:57,683
Okay. When I go places
with high humidity...

139
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:01,270
it gets a little extra body, okay?

140
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:05,690
That's why our honeymoon photos
look like me and Diana Ross.

141
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:07,650
I'll show you guys where to check in.

142
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:10,820
Oh, honey? Can you make sure
we get a king-size bed?

143
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:15,742
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh, and
see if they have a heart-shaped one.

144
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:18,996
And with mirrors on the ceiling.

145
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,875
And make sure our room
isn't next to theirs.

146
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:26,295
Oh, you guys are so lucky
you're here with people.

147
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,671
You know, it's just
such a romantic place.

148
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:33,593
I just wish I could share it with a guy.

149
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,222
- Not Joey.
- Not Joey. No.

150
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,477
- I was just lusting after Chandler.
- Yeah, right.

151
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:49,568
So... I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.

152
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:51,277
Tonight?

153
00:10:51,612 --> 00:10:55,073
Isn't an engagement ring
supposed to have a diamond?

154
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,410
Oh, there it is.

155
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,955
Yes, well, being a failed scientist doesn't
pay quite as well as you might think.

156
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:06,334
That's one-seventieth of a carat.

157
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:10,421
And the clarity is quite poor.

158
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,050
Nice.

159
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:18,597
- Monica, can I talk to you for a second?
- Okay.

160
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:20,641
David's gonna propose
to Phoebe tonight.

161
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,727
See what happens
when you give people advice?

162
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:27,522
- Well, I hope you told him not to.
- That would be advice!

163
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,650
Okay, fine. I'll handle this.

164
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:35,238
- Phoebe?
- Yeah?

165
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,910
- I need to talk to you.
- Are you leaving the Supremes?

166
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:51,546
Okay, my husband just gave
your boyfriend some very bad advice.

167
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,924
David's gonna propose to you tonight.

168
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,593
Wow, really?

169
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,721
That's fantastic!

170
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,474
What? Are you serious?
You want to marry him?

171
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:06,687
- What about Mike?
- Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?

172
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:09,021
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...

173
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:11,525
and force him down the aisle, okay?

174
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,402
I can just see it.
"Mike, do you take Phoebe?"

175
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:20,575
You know? It's every girl's dream.

176
00:12:21,285 --> 00:12:24,288
Do you really think marrying
someone else is the right answer?

177
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:28,708
Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?
I love Mike... David!

178
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:32,503
David! I love David.

179
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:35,716
Don't look at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.

180
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:44,558
"By using CT scans and computer
imaging, we can, in a very real way...

181
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:49,353
bring the Mesozoic Era
into the 21 st century."

182
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:54,735
It's great. You'll be the hit
of the conference.

183
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,527
It'll be even better tomorrow...

184
00:12:56,737 --> 00:12:59,323
because I won't be constantly
interrupted by Joey...

185
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,409
checking to see if they put
chocolates on my pillow yet.

186
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,748
- Hey, guys.
- The chocolates aren't here.

187
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:10,876
Damn it!

188
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,337
Ross just read me his speech.
It's fantastic.

189
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:16,839
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because I'd love to give it a read.

190
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,968
If you want to check your e-mail,
just ask.

191
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,304
What? May I?

192
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:29,937
What's with the rain, Geller? I mean,
when I signed up for dino week...

193
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:33,022
nobody said anything
about it being monsoon season.

194
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:36,818
- The wet season is June to December.
- It's not the time, Charlie.

195
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,279
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!

196
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,698
What, did someone outbid you
for the teapot?

197
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:47,954
Secret teapot.

198
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:50,623
Your computer. I don't know what...
Everything's gone.

199
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,918
- What do you mean?
- Must be a virus.

200
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:55,045
I think it erased your hard drive.

201
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:57,548
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?

202
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,092
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail
and I opened it.

203
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,011
- Why? Why would you open it?
- Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus."

204
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:08,016
- What did it say?
- "Nude..."

205
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:11,978
"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."

206
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,607
- I'm so sorry.
- What am I gonna do?

207
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,860
- My speech is gone!
- It's not gone.

208
00:14:18,068 --> 00:14:20,737
I'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy?

209
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:22,530
No, I don't!

210
00:14:23,656 --> 00:14:27,243
Well, you must be pretty mad
at yourself right now.

211
00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:38,838
- It's really gone?
- Yep.

212
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,967
I'd like to thank you guys
for coming down here...

213
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,179
to complain about the rain
and ruin my career.

214
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:47,305
- I just feel awful.
- Yeah, you should.

215
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:52,644
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? She's
never even won a major tournament.

216
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:56,689
Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but...

217
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,486
You know, you and Monica have
the same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.

218
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,865
I can usually make it go away
by kissing her.

219
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,700
Get out.

220
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,663
You know, this happens all the time
to my computer at work.

221
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,540
- What do you do?
- I usually go...

222
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:16,043
play Tetris on somebody else's
computer.

223
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,878
I can't believe this is happening.

224
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:21,548
I have to give the keynote speech
tomorrow.

225
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:25,385
I have to stand up in front of all
these people. What am I gonna say?

226
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,762
You can use a speech I memorized
for auditions.

227
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:31,599
I don't think your monologue from
"Star Wars" is gonna help me right now.

228
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,937
Ross, we can solve this.
I just heard your speech.

229
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:39,732
- We can re-create it. We've got all night.
- What, you really think we can do that?

230
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:43,362
Oh, wait.
Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.

231
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:45,948
Don't worry about that.
I mean, Ross needs you.

232
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:49,910
Rachel and I will stay and help
any way we can.

233
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,579
All right. Okay, let's do it.

234
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:58,376
Well, I know we start by discussing
the shortcomings of carbon dating.

235
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:02,088
And then I move on to what is clearly
the defining moment...

236
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:06,843
of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?

237
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:11,180
And then there's the overview
of the Triassic.

238
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,434
Any chance any of this happened
in a galaxy far, far away?

239
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:25,695
- Hello?
"- Okay", "Mike?"

240
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:28,448
Enough is enough.
You love Phoebe, and she loves you.

241
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,242
So get over your
l-never-wanna-get-married thing...

242
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,828
and step up!

243
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:34,954
Who is this?

244
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,373
"This is Monica", "Phoebe's friend."

245
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,208
Phoebe is back with David.

246
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:41,545
He's gonna propose,
and she's gonna say yes...

247
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:44,006
but I know she really wants to be
with you.

248
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:48,676
He's gonna propose?

249
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:54,308
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I can't hear through all this damned hair!

250
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,685
If Phoebe wants to marry David,
she should.

251
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,814
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
Neither should you.

252
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:03,692
You don't tell me what to do.
I tell you what to do.

253
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:08,029
Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel
in Barbados.

254
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,448
And while I've got you,
you've got curly hair.

255
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,534
What do you do in the humidity?

256
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:15,829
Damn it!

257
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:22,794
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- I hope you're happy too, honey.

258
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,796
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.

259
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:30,259
- That's what happens when you meddle.
- Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.

260
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:32,595
No, it's not.
She's still in love with Mike.

261
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,097
- There's no chance that will work?
- No, I called.

262
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:38,685
- It's not gonna happen.
- Meddler! Meddler!

263
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:40,938
If you hadn't meddled to start with...

264
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,814
then I wouldn't have had to go in
and meddle myself.

265
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:47,026
No matter how much we meddle,
we'll never be able to unmeddle...

266
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:50,072
the thing that you meddled up
in the first place!

267
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,908
This vacation sucks!

268
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:01,123
I'm so bored.

269
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:05,086
Stupid rain. We can't do anything.

270
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:07,922
Well, I brought some books.
We could read.

271
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,092
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.

272
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:13,178
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.

273
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:16,515
I'm sorry, sir, these are
for the pharmaceutical convention.

274
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:21,812
You feel like going to a convention?

275
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,399
- We can't. We're not pharmacists.
- I know we're not...

276
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:31,487
but Frank Madaio and Eva...

277
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:37,702
- Kate Miller.
- Kate Miller it is.

278
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,663
- Okay.
- Oh, good...

279
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:44,458
And that's the most sex
I'm gonna have this weekend.

280
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:48,714
Well, in that case,
should I make sure it's on real good?

281
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,220
Thank you.

282
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:02,143
Oh, and then you said that thing about
bringing the Mesozoic Era...

283
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,438
into the 21 st century.

284
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:06,273
Well, yeah. That's it?

285
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:08,941
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. We did it.

286
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,947
Actually, I did it, Ross. You remembered
shockingly little of your own speech.

287
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:18,368
Yes, but I did make a pyramid
out of the bath products.

288
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,832
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

289
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,961
That's a pretty necklace.

290
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:32,925
Thank you.

291
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:36,385
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
Champagne?

292
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:40,724
Yeah! Save the cork, and that way,
we can fill the bottle with water...

293
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,227
and put it back so they
don't charge you.

294
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:48,356
Oh, my God, I love you.

295
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,568
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son...

296
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:55,531
or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?

297
00:19:55,781 --> 00:19:58,242
That's Ben, my son
from my first marriage.

298
00:19:58,492 --> 00:19:59,951
- Your first marriage?
- Yeah.

299
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,579
You've been married more than once?

300
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,372
No.

301
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,335
So why'd you break up?

302
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,715
Oh, it was...

303
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:19,220
It's complicated, you know?
She was...

304
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,140
gay.
- Oh, my God.

305
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:24,016
This is so cool!

306
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:27,187
Okay.
Odd thing to get excited about.

307
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:30,815
No, it's just that I was engaged
to a guy who turned out to be gay.

308
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:32,942
Hey! High-five!

309
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,488
Didn't you feel so stupid
that you didn't see the signs?

310
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:41,034
My fiance was always going on
long weekends with his "tennis partner."

311
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:45,746
My wife had a workout friend she went
to the gym with every day for a year.

312
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:48,417
She didn't get any fitter.

313
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,545
- Everybody's like, "I knew all along."
- I know.

314
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:55,340
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?
I mean, call, leave a note.

315
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:58,552
"Hi. Just dropped by
to say your wife's gay."

316
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:00,219
- I know.
- And then...

317
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,181
And then you try to make the best
of a bad situation...

318
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,310
so you float the idea of a threesome.

319
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,853
I didn't do that.

320
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,565
Me neither.

321
00:21:15,193 --> 00:21:17,946
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.

322
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:21,199
I know. That old lady at the end
was ready to take you home.

323
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:24,495
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.

324
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:30,625
What about you, huh? You're the single
one. See anybody in there you like?

325
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,630
Well, let's see. There was that
really big guy that I was talking to...

326
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:37,673
with the really nice breasts.

327
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:43,596
But what about back home? Anything
going on there? Anybody you like?

328
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,435
No.

329
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:53,606
- There is. You're blushing.
- No, I'm not blushing...

330
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:55,650
and I'm sunburned.

331
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:58,528
From, you know, the rain.

332
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,572
You like someone. Tell me who.

333
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:03,033
- Tell me who it is. Come on.
- No. Joey.

334
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:05,910
Who do you like?
You're not getting away that easy.

335
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:07,871
- Who do you like?
- Joey, come on!

336
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:12,583
It doesn't matter, you know?
It's not like anything's gonna happen.

337
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:17,130
What? Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?

338
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:26,723
Okay. Okay.
You really want to know who it is?

339
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:29,685
- Yeah. Who is it?
- Do you?

340
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:33,647
- Oh, hey.
- I just left you a message.

341
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:35,899
Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite...

342
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:38,693
but now that you're here,
we could have that dinner.

343
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:42,613
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?

344
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:45,242
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.

345
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:47,326
- I had a great time.
- Yeah.

346
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:49,912
This isn't over,
because I really want to know...

347
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:51,539
Later. Later.

348
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:54,625
- So shall we?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:56,711
- Okay.
- Good night.

350
00:22:57,004 --> 00:22:58,964
Good night.

351
00:23:05,512 --> 00:23:08,681
- Okay, good night.
- Good night, Ross.

352
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:15,479
I can't believe she's gonna
say yes to David.

353
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:17,774
She's clearly in love with Mike.

354
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:21,820
You know, it's very hard to take you
seriously when you look like that.

355
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,496
Phoebe, I have something I want to say.

356
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,458
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
I cannot watch this. Let's go.

357
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,084
I think we have time.
Have you heard him talk?

358
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:42,381
"Phoebe, I would be honored if..."
Spit it out, David!

359
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:45,760
Phoebe.

360
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:55,437
You're an amazing woman, and the time
we spent apart was unbearable.

361
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:59,065
Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk
didn't help.

362
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:00,609
Sure. Okay. Yeah.

363
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:06,907
But, well, now that we're together
again, I don't ever want to be apart.

364
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:11,160
So to that end...

365
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:17,708
- Oh, my God, Mike.
- It's David, actually.

366
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,795
No, Mike's here.

367
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:22,589
Oh, hey, Mike.

368
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:26,093
Hi, David.

369
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:29,679
Chandler. Monic... Oh!

370
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:35,352
It's the humidity!

371
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:41,733
- Hi, Phoebe.
- What are you doing here?

372
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,443
I have a question I need to ask you.

373
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:48,364
I have a question I was kind of
gonna ask her myself.

374
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:52,910
Yeah, I understand, but before you do,
she really needs to hear this.

375
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,622
Okay.

376
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:00,835
- Would you care for my seat as well?
- Actually, yeah, that'd be great.

377
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:04,297
Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.

378
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,727
Phoebe, I love you.

379
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:20,689
I've missed you so much
these last few months.

380
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,150
I thought we were apart
for a good reason...

381
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:25,818
but I realized that there was no reason
good enough...

382
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:29,531
to keep me from spending
the rest of my life with you.

383
00:25:29,948 --> 00:25:33,326
Kind of steps on the toes
of what I was going to say.

384
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:37,622
I'm sorry, David,
but she really has to know this.

385
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:41,125
All right, but after this,
I want to see you outside.

386
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:42,960
If the rain stops.

387
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:49,718
You're the most incredible woman
I've ever met.

388
00:25:50,468 --> 00:25:55,349
How could I lose you?
Now, I don't actually have a ring.

389
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:58,893
- I have a ring.
- I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.

390
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,397
But, Phoebe...

391
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:05,734
will you marry me?

392
00:26:09,112 --> 00:26:10,656
No.

393
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,125
I love you, but I never needed
a proposal from you.

394
00:26:23,377 --> 00:26:25,795
I just needed to know
we were headed somewhere.

395
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:31,008
- That we had a future.
- We can have any future you want.

396
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:40,477
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.

397
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,397
David, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

398
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:47,650
Just so I know, if I had asked first...?

399
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,364
Yeah, I might have said yes,
but that would've been wrong.

400
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,410
Please, you don't have to explain.

401
00:26:56,618 --> 00:26:59,496
I mean, perhaps if I hadn't
gone to Minsk...

402
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:04,625
things would have worked out for us,
and I wouldn't have ruined my career.

403
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:08,045
Or lost that toe to frostbite.

404
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,173
It was a good trip.

405
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:16,513
- Is it okay if I hug you now?
- Oh, yes.

406
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:23,144
Because of our meddling! All right?

407
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,033
Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.
I could just lie here all day.

408
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,451
Oh, I know.

409
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:44,833
- Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
- So glad we got adjoining rooms.

410
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:50,464
- The sun is out!
- Hey! Remember when I had corneas?

411
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:52,423
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.

412
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:56,969
- I will get the magazines and the lotion.
- Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.

413
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,055
- No!
- Damn it!

414
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,767
Walls are pretty thin, guys.

415
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:13,487
"Then we have to weigh the data from
recent MRI scans and DNA testing...

416
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:19,575
which call into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating."

417
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:23,538
Look at the woman sitting out
by the pool getting tan.

418
00:28:23,746 --> 00:28:27,417
She's all leathery and wrinkled.
I'm so jealous!

419
00:28:27,918 --> 00:28:31,964
"Finally, factor in the profusion
of new species recently discovered.

420
00:28:32,171 --> 00:28:34,341
Giganotosaurus.

421
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,762
"- Argentinosaurus."
- Not to mention "Coldsaurus."

422
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:45,643
"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not
even gonna discuss the carnivores.

423
00:28:45,852 --> 00:28:47,478
Their heads are already too big.

424
00:28:47,688 --> 00:28:51,608
Which is ironic, considering
their stunted cerebral development."

425
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:57,447
Really?

426
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:02,702
"But all kidding aside,
in much the same way...

427
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,791
that "Homo ergaster" is thought to be a
separate species from "Homo erectus"..."

428
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:14,672
- What?
- He said "erectus."

429
00:29:14,881 --> 00:29:19,303
- You're kidding, right?
- No, he really said it.

430
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:22,973
"And while there are certainly
vast differences...

431
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:27,977
between these Mesozoic fossils
and the example of "Homo erectus"..."

432
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:31,981
"Erectus"?

433
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:34,442
- Homo.
- Right.

434
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:41,909
"In a very real way, we can bring
the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century."

435
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:44,452
Thank you.

436
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,044
- Really great.
- Oh, thanks, guys.

437
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:57,507
I thought it was wonderful.
Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.

438
00:29:57,716 --> 00:30:03,471
I mean, the ideas you put forth,
and from someone so young and...

439
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:12,189
Okay, now we're just holding hands.

440
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,317
Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
That was really great.

441
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:19,196
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah. Oh, and so funny.

442
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:23,534
- Take it easy.
- All right, thanks. Thanks so much.

443
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:26,327
I can't tell you how much it means
that you were here.

444
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:28,412
You kidding?
We wouldn't have missed it.

445
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,794
I'm back.

446
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,672
Okay. Well, excuse me?

447
00:30:39,757 --> 00:30:41,634
- Well?
- You were incredible.

448
00:30:41,843 --> 00:30:43,219
You blew them away.

449
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:47,306
I can't tell you how great it was
to look in the crowd and see your face.

450
00:30:47,516 --> 00:30:51,102
I mean, did you know you were
mouthing the words along with me?

451
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:52,896
- I was not.
- No, it's okay.

452
00:30:53,146 --> 00:30:56,065
It made me feel like a rock star.

453
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,443
Oh, my God. I'm your groupie.

454
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:02,738
Hey, I better not find you naked
in my hotel room.

455
00:31:06,994 --> 00:31:09,079
Look, I took it too far.

456
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:18,255
I can't believe it's raining again.
It's so unfair.

457
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:21,216
Well, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...

458
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:24,844
all these paleontologists
with their shirts off.

459
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:29,141
Not you guys.

460
00:31:29,474 --> 00:31:32,143
You've got it going on.

461
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:38,191
- What will we do today?
- They have a game room downstairs.

462
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,942
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.

463
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:41,987
Ping-Pong?
Honey, they have Ping-Pong.

464
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:44,531
- Let's play.
- I don't think so.

465
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,035
- Why not?
- You know how competitive you get.

466
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:51,330
And while I say it's cute,
others disagree, and I'm lying.

467
00:31:53,122 --> 00:31:55,667
- I'm not always that bad.
- Oh, yeah?

468
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:58,253
What happened when we played
last time?

469
00:31:58,461 --> 00:32:01,006
I punched you.

470
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:04,008
- And?
- Phoebe.

471
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:08,263
- And?
- I clunked your heads together.

472
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,284
- There you are.
- Hey. Listen.

473
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:33,080
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeling.

474
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,999
Some kid told me about this sea turtle.
If you blow bubbles in his face...

475
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,545
he chases you.

476
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:44,257
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm running
a discussion group all afternoon.

477
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:47,009
That's okay.
I'll find someone else to do it.

478
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,012
I'd do it alone, but...

479
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,682
I don't know what happens
if the sea turtle catches you.

480
00:32:53,516 --> 00:32:55,561
You know, I feel so bad.

481
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:58,604
I haven't seen you this whole trip.
Especially last night...

482
00:32:58,814 --> 00:33:02,234
Don't worry about it. It was fine.
I had the best time with Rachel.

483
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:06,362
I just felt bad for you, stuck
in that room working on Ross' speech.

484
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:09,699
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.

485
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:14,371
Oh, well, at least
we're both having fun, right?

486
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:18,708
- Is it weird that it's not with each other?
- Yeah.

487
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,544
A little bit, yeah.

488
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,676
I think we need to talk.

489
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:31,638
Yeah, I think we do.

490
00:33:34,307 --> 00:33:35,892
About what?

491
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:41,773
- Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!
- All right.

492
00:33:41,981 --> 00:33:45,693
- I'll play if we don't keep score.
- Well, then how do we know who wins?

493
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:51,533
- Nobody wins.
- So we're just four losers. Super.

494
00:33:52,618 --> 00:33:55,120
- Well, I'm not playing with her.
- I'm out.

495
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:57,121
- I'll play you.
- Okay.

496
00:33:57,331 --> 00:33:59,833
- You don't know what you're doing.
- She gets crazy.

497
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,628
This scar? That's from Pictionary.

498
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:06,340
I think I'll be all right.

499
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:10,343
- You want to volley a bit for serve?
- Sure, if you want to.

500
00:34:16,517 --> 00:34:19,894
Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.

501
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:24,691
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.

502
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:27,485
- You ready to play?
- Hell, yeah.

503
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:33,450
- Did you know this about him?
- No idea. I thought he was soft like you.

504
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:36,537
- Want to make it more interesting?
- How much you thinking?

505
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:38,539
- Ten bucks a game?
- Make it 50.

506
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:40,289
- I'll make it 100.
- One thousand...

507
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:42,416
Okay!

508
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:45,628
We'll flip to see who goes first.
You got a quarter?

509
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:48,798
No. Either of you girls got a quarter?

510
00:34:50,092 --> 00:34:52,593
Honey, try to focus the trash talk
on him.

511
00:34:54,012 --> 00:34:57,224
- Monica, you call it.
- Heads. No, tails! Heads!

512
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:59,851
- Tails.
- Oh, what are the chances?

513
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:06,733
- My point!
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

514
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:10,653
Standard rules: If at any time a player
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...

515
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:13,865
to touch the playing surface,
he or she forfeits the point.

516
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,371
He was a lawyer.

517
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:23,541
All the East Coast
is having beautiful weather.

518
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,751
"In New York", "it's 72 and sunny."

519
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:28,421
Weather bitch.

520
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:32,258
It's open.

521
00:35:33,593 --> 00:35:35,052
- Hi, Joe.
- Hey.

522
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,599
- What? Is everything okay?
- Charlie and I broke up.

523
00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:41,894
No. Why?

524
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:44,896
Well, she said
we have nothing in common.

525
00:35:45,104 --> 00:35:46,981
That's crazy.

526
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:49,776
No, it's not.
We have nothing in common.

527
00:35:50,903 --> 00:35:53,113
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah.

528
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:56,365
I mean, she should be with someone
more like Ross.

529
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:59,785
You know, I mean he uses
all those big words too.

530
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:03,916
- Man, smart people are dull.
- Well, hey!

531
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:06,376
Okay, Rach.

532
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:13,425
I feel so stupid, you know? Why do I
keep going after the wrong girls?

533
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:16,260
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come on.

534
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,892
I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.
It's like... What the hell's my problem?

535
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:24,144
I just...

536
00:36:28,023 --> 00:36:33,903
Okay. Maybe you're not
always going after the wrong girl.

537
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:37,157
I'm telling you, Rach,
Charlie is not right for me.

538
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:40,409
- I'm not talking about her.
- Well, then, who?

539
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:43,329
The waitress I went out with last month?

540
00:36:44,622 --> 00:36:46,666
- You know what? Forget it.
- No, no, no, no.

541
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,211
- Who are you talking about?
- No, I don't...

542
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:52,255
I actually don't know who
I'm talking about, so...

543
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:54,758
- Okay.
- Yeah.

544
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,802
Well, I'm gonna go see
if I can get a room for tonight.

545
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:01,722
- And I'll see you later.
- Yeah, sure. Okay.

546
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:30,084
- You like me?
- Okay.

547
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:33,380
- Let's not make a big thing about this.
- It's a huge thing!

548
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,756
Okay, not working with me, Joe.

549
00:37:36,175 --> 00:37:41,387
Look, here's the thing.
Lately, I have been having thoughts.

550
00:37:41,805 --> 00:37:43,891
Musings, if you will.

551
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,686
- Well, for how long?
- Oh, only like a month.

552
00:37:47,936 --> 00:37:49,563
- A month?
- Well...

553
00:37:49,813 --> 00:37:55,318
Dial it down. Listen, maybe they're
crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do.

554
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:58,905
I have been thinking about,
you know, us.

555
00:38:00,698 --> 00:38:03,994
- Okay, dial it up a little.
- Oh, you're right. Okay.

556
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:05,746
- I just have a question.
- Shoot.

557
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:09,333
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not trying to do anything.

558
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:12,836
It's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?

559
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:17,256
And I mean, aren't you just
a little curious what it would be like?

560
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:21,385
Am I curious?
I mean, I'm as curious as...

561
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:24,014
George!

562
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:28,017
- Who?
- Curious George!

563
00:38:28,226 --> 00:38:30,979
You know, the monkey and the guy
with the yellow hat.

564
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:33,564
- Of course. I remember.
- He had a paper route.

565
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:35,566
Yeah, he did.

566
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:39,238
- See, this is what I'm talking about.
- No, I know. We're great!

567
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:42,198
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.

568
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:46,285
Can't it just happen a little bit?

569
00:38:48,622 --> 00:38:51,834
- No! It can't happen at all!
- Why not?

570
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:55,711
Because, look, no one wants
this to happen more than me, okay?

571
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:59,298
I have gone over this moment
in my head 100 times...

572
00:38:59,508 --> 00:39:02,845
and not once did I ever say no.

573
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:09,559
I couldn't do it to Ross.

574
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,229
- But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
- I know. I know...

575
00:39:13,396 --> 00:39:18,901
but I've thought about it a lot
since then, and it just wouldn't be right.

576
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,157
I'm sorry.

577
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:28,162
I'm sorry too.

578
00:39:29,496 --> 00:39:31,914
- Oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, no.

579
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:34,126
No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

580
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:37,003
- Like you said, it's no big deal.
- It's not a big deal.

581
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:39,173
- No big deal.
- It's so not a big deal.

582
00:39:39,423 --> 00:39:42,758
- I'll see you later. All right, hey.
- Okay, great.

583
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,322
Okay...

584
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:21,340
Oh, I'm sorry, I think...
I think that may have missed the table.

585
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:23,258
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

586
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:24,592
- Do you?
- Yeah.

587
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:26,637
- Do you?
- Yeah!

588
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,724
- You really find this attractive on him?
- Oh, yeah.

589
00:40:30,974 --> 00:40:34,852
Are you telling me you're not even
a little turned on by Monica right now?

590
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:45,238
This is the first time in our marriage that
I've felt like the more attractive one.

591
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,367
All right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.

592
00:40:48,617 --> 00:40:51,035
Knock that dog off her head.

593
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:57,084
- Damn it!
- I sleep with him!

594
00:40:59,086 --> 00:41:01,421
- Game point.
- Don't get too cocky.

595
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,173
Remember, I won the last one.

596
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,425
Oh, by the way,
how did that feel, losing to a girl?

597
00:41:06,677 --> 00:41:09,595
You should look in the mirror
before you call yourself that.

598
00:41:14,017 --> 00:41:17,436
- No! No! No!
- And that's how it's done.

599
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:19,356
Okey-dokey.

600
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:23,568
You've each won a game, and I've lost
what's felt like a year of my life.

601
00:41:23,776 --> 00:41:25,612
Everybody goes home a winner.

602
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:27,572
- Best of three?
- That's what I'm thinking.

603
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:32,744
Should I use my invisibility
to fight crime or for evil?

604
00:41:33,954 --> 00:41:36,331
- Serve the ball, chump.
- "Serve the ball, chump."

605
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:40,209
Okay, better comebacks, Mike.
Better comebacks.

606
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:45,340
I'm just saying,
I have a cabin in the Adirondacks.

607
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,510
If you ever want to get away
from the city, well, that'd be...

608
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,389
just nifty.

609
00:41:54,474 --> 00:41:59,354
Well, I've kind of got a lot on my plate
right now.

610
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:03,941
Not that I wouldn't love a weekend
in the country with a strange man.

611
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,697
- Jarvis?
- Oh, you're back.

612
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:13,952
- This is my wife, Nancy.
- Well, get out!

613
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:18,706
- Ross? Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes, please.

614
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:24,421
So, what's going on?

615
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,177
Well, Joey and I broke up.

616
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:36,099
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Joey is a great guy...

617
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:38,809
but we're just...
We're so different.

618
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:42,313
I mean, like, during your speech,
he kept laughing at "Homo erectus."

619
00:42:42,563 --> 00:42:44,983
I knew that was him!

620
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:50,530
Anyway, I just...
I think it's for the best.

621
00:42:51,322 --> 00:42:55,827
- Hey. Hey, you okay?
- I guess.

622
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,164
There was...

623
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:06,338
There was another reason that I thought
it was time to end it with Joey.

624
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,970
I started to realize that I was
having feelings for someone else.

625
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:17,139
Okay, Geller.
Last day of the conference.

626
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:19,642
You know what happens
to the keynote speaker.

627
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:22,896
Professor Klarik, we're in the middle
of a conversation here.

628
00:43:23,063 --> 00:43:27,441
- Can't you throw him in the pool later?
- Or we could throw you both in now.

629
00:43:27,693 --> 00:43:31,070
Okay, gentlemen, please.
Aren't we a little old for this?

630
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,948
I mean, we're scientists, all right?
We're academics...

631
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:38,244
and most importantly,
you will have to catch us first.

632
00:43:38,412 --> 00:43:40,539
Go! Go! Go!

633
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:52,258
Okay, so it's tied again,
41 to 41.

634
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,180
- Okay, look, enough is enough.
- No.

635
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,392
- I just have two more points to beat him.
- Monica, that was also true an hour ago!

636
00:44:01,601 --> 00:44:03,144
I mean, please, look at you.

637
00:44:03,394 --> 00:44:07,858
Your hand is blistered, you can
barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!

638
00:44:09,776 --> 00:44:12,278
You've already proven
you're just as good as he is.

639
00:44:12,488 --> 00:44:15,448
We missed our dinner reservations,
so let's just go upstairs...

640
00:44:15,657 --> 00:44:18,659
order room service, take a shower
and shave your head!

641
00:44:20,537 --> 00:44:23,539
I can't just walk away.
I've put in four hours.

642
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,209
You knew this about me
when you married me.

643
00:44:26,418 --> 00:44:29,338
You agreed to take me in sickness
and in health.

644
00:44:29,546 --> 00:44:32,048
Well, this is my sickness!

645
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:35,927
- What about the obsessive cleaning?
- That's just good sense.

646
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,686
- You okay?
- No, honey, I'm okay.

647
00:44:45,938 --> 00:44:49,816
Shake it off. Oh, no shaking.
No shaking. No shaking.

648
00:44:53,403 --> 00:44:56,907
Oh, my God. I can't play.

649
00:44:57,157 --> 00:44:59,534
- So you forfeit?
- Mike wins?

650
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:03,956
I can't believe it. I lost.

651
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:10,671
- No, you didn't.
- What?

652
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:14,006
- Because I'm gonna play for you.
- You can't do that.

653
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:17,510
It's okay.
I don't care which of them I beat.

654
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:22,139
Okay, we're taking that paddle home,
mister.

655
00:45:25,686 --> 00:45:28,104
- Honey, you don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

656
00:45:28,354 --> 00:45:30,606
I may not understand why
you have to win so badly...

657
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:33,360
but if it's important to you,
it's important to me.

658
00:45:33,568 --> 00:45:35,195
Because I love you.

659
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:39,657
But you suck.

660
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:42,785
You're welcome, sweetheart.

661
00:45:43,787 --> 00:45:46,164
All right, let's get this over with.
Sudden death.

662
00:45:46,372 --> 00:45:50,251
- Whoever wins this point, wins.
- Okay.

663
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:58,927
- Oh, my God. You're good.
- It's like watching porn.

664
00:46:04,682 --> 00:46:07,351
And that's how it's done.

665
00:46:09,313 --> 00:46:12,733
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That was so amazing.

666
00:46:12,941 --> 00:46:14,735
Well, when did you...?

667
00:46:14,943 --> 00:46:19,072
Hold on, I almost forgot. Loser.

668
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:25,204
- When did you stop sucking?
- I never sucked. I just didn't want you...

669
00:46:25,412 --> 00:46:27,414
to know how good I was.
- Why?

670
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:29,583
- I don't know.
- Well, this is so great.

671
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:32,461
- Now we can enter doubles tournaments.
- That's why.

672
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,014
- They still looking for us?
- Yeah.

673
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,017
The bartender said they split up
into two search parties.

674
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:49,602
The herbivores and the carnivores.

675
00:46:50,979 --> 00:46:54,398
You know, we, as a group,
are not the coolest.

676
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:56,443
Oh, look out.

677
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:06,410
- I don't think they saw us.
- I don't think they did.

678
00:47:13,293 --> 00:47:17,338
So I started to tell you something earlier.

679
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:24,637
There was another reason that I realized
it was time to end it with Joey.

680
00:47:24,847 --> 00:47:29,976
I kind of realized I was starting
to have feelings...

681
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:32,354
for someone else.

682
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:38,110
And can I ask who?

683
00:47:39,278 --> 00:47:41,320
I think you know.

684
00:47:42,405 --> 00:47:47,994
I think I know too, but I've been really
wrong about this stuff in the past, so...

685
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:10,851
- I'm sorry, we can't.
- All right. All right.

686
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:14,688
I mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?

687
00:48:14,938 --> 00:48:18,650
I just think it would be a really,
really bad idea.

688
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,282
Or not. I mean...

689
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,862
What?

690
00:49:58,584 --> 00:49:59,584
