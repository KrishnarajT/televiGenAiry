1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,880
Rach, we're running low
on résumés over here.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,920
Do you really want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,079
If you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones to work for.

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,679
Hey, look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here, okay?

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,839
I can't be a waitress anymore.
I mean it.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,359
I'm sick of the lousy tips. I'm sick
of being called "Excuse Me."

7
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,399
Rach, did you proofread these?

8
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,119
Yeah. Why?

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Nothing.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,920
I'm sure they'll be impressed with
your excellent "compuper" skills.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,399
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,799
Do you think it's on all of them?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,159
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.

14
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,480
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

15
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,959
Hey. Hi, ladies.

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,560
Can I get you anything?

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,519
- Did you bring the mail?
- Lots of responses.

18
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:55,319
Really? Sure we have scones left.

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,400
Okay, read them to me.

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,760
"Dear Miss Green: Thank you
for your inquiry. However…"

21
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,079
- We have apple cinnamon…
- Okay, "Dear Miss Green"…

22
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,080
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No.

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
- Wow.
- What?

24
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,639
Your Visa bill is huge.

25
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,599
Give me that.

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,840
You know, I can't believe you.
Linda is so great.

27
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,319
Why won't you go out with her again?

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
I don't know.

29
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,800
Is this still about her whole

30
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,199
"The Flintstones could
have really happened" thing?

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,759
It's not just that.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,639
It's just, I want someone
who does something for me,

33
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,439
you know,
who gets my heart pounding…

34
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,400
Who makes me, uh…

35
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,400
Little play things with yarn?

36
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,439
What?

37
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,840
Could you want her more?

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,560
Who?

39
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,960
Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!

40
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,280
Who?

41
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,840
Look, I am totally, totally
over her, okay?

42
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,520
- I just… Hi.
- Hi. Coffee?

43
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,800
- No, we're fine.
- Okay.

44
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,039
Shut up.

45
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,080
We're not saying anything.

46
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,560
- What?
- Uh, Joey cried last night.

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
Thank you.

48
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,240
We were playing poker, right?

49
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,080
There was chocolate on the three.
It looked like an eight, all right?

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,039
God, you should've seen him.
"Read them and weep."

51
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,879
And then he did.

52
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,759
Well, now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,960
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of guy thing?

54
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,960
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

55
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,159
Like, it's poker,
so only guys can play?

56
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,520
- No. Women are welcome to play.
- Oh, okay, so then what is it?

57
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,879
Some kind of, you know, like,
some kind of, you know, like…

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,599
All right, what is it?

59
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,439
There just don't happen
to be any women in our game.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,400
Yeah, we just don't happen
to know any women

61
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,360
that know how to play poker.

62
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,319
Please. That is such a lame excuse.
I mean, it's a typical guy response.

63
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,360
Excuse me, do any of you
know how to play?

64
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,800
No.

65
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,560
But you could teach us.

66
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,000
No.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,759
Okay, so now we draw cards.

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,160
So I wouldn't need any, right?
Because I have a straight.

69
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,360
- Oh, good for you.
- Congratulations.

70
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,120
Okay, Pheebs,
how many do you want?

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,279
Okay, I just need two.

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,160
The 10 of spades
and the six of clubs.

73
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,560
No, uh, Pheebs,
you can't do that.

74
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,560
I have the 10 of spades.
Here, you want it?

75
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,839
Thanks.

76
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,560
No, see, uh, you can't do that.

77
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,000
No. That's okay. I don't need
them. I'm going for fours.

78
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,319
Oh, you're…

79
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,879
All right, here we go.

80
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
We've got salmon roulettes
and assorted crudités.

81
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,000
Monica, what are you doing?

82
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,000
This is a poker game. You can't serve
food with more than one syllable.

83
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:06,319
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz…

84
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,360
Okay, so at this point, the dealer…

85
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,079
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes. Big bucks.

86
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,480
All right, now, you sure?
Phoebe just threw away two jacks

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
because they didn't look happy.

88
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
But I'm ready. So just deal.

89
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,199
Okay, all right, last minute lesson.
Last minute lesson. Joey.

90
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,959
Three…

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,560
…eight.

92
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,480
Eight, three.
All right. Here we go.

93
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,360
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

94
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,199
I see. So then, um, you were lying.

95
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,399
- About what?
- About how good your cards were.

96
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,240
I was bluffing.

97
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,360
Aha. And what is "bluffing"?

98
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Is it not another word for lying?

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,680
Okay, sorry to break up this party,

100
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,800
but I've got résumés to fax
before work tomorrow.

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,319
Rach, we've got to settle.

102
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,000
Settle what?

103
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,040
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

104
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,800
You see, King George
is giving us the land, so…

105
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,639
The game, Rachel. The game.
You owe us money for the game.

106
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Oh, right.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
You know what, guys?
It's their first time.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,319
Why don't we forget about the money?

109
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,000
Hell, no. We'll pay.

110
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,120
Okay, Monica,
I had another answer all ready.

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
And you know what?

112
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,519
- We want a rematch.
- Well, that's fine with me.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,480
Could use the money.

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,639
So, basically, you get your ya-yas

115
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,480
by taking money
from all of your friends.

116
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,639
- Yeah.
- Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea.

117
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,000
You have to put them together
yourself,

118
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,120
but they cost a little less.

119
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,199
Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win, all right?

120
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:56,600
In order for me to win,
other people have to lose.

121
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,959
So if you're gonna play poker
with me,

122
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,199
don't expect me to be a nice guy.

123
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,079
Okay, because once those cards
are dealt…

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
Yeah?

125
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,480
I'm not a nice guy.

126
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,720
All right, boys. Let's eat.

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,199
Did you get that from
the "I Love Rachel" pizzeria?

128
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,480
- You still on that?
- Come on.

129
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,720
What was with that whole
Black Bart speech?

130
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,000
"When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy".

131
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,240
You're way off, pal.

132
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,759
No, I don't think so. See, Ross,
because I think you love her.

133
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,759
Uh, no.

134
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,879
See, I might have had feelings
for her at one time.

135
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,160
Not anymore.

136
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,839
I just… Marcel.

137
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,240
Where are you going with that disk?
You are not putting that on again.

138
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,560
Marcel… Okay.
If you press that button,

139
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,160
you are in very, very big trouble.

140
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,519
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,839
Yeah, I know.
He can get really competitive.

142
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,439
What?

143
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,160
"Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black."

144
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,040
Please.

145
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,000
I am not as bad as Ross.

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,320
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

147
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,600
That was not an incident.

148
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,000
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

149
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,240
- I got an interview.
- You're kidding. Where? Where?

150
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,639
- Saks Fifth Avenue.
- Oh, Rachel.

151
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,159
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

152
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,919
- Well, what's the job?
- Assistant buyer.

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,480
I would be shopping…

154
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,440
…for a living.

155
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,879
Okay, look. That's Aunt Iris.

156
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,279
This woman has been playing poker
since she was 5.

157
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,679
You've gotta listen
to every word she says.

158
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,799
- Hi.
- Is Tony Randall dead?

159
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,480
- Oh, why?
- I don't think so.

160
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,600
Well, he may be now because
I think I hit him with my car.

161
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,679
My God. Really?

162
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,519
No, that's bluffing.
Lesson number one.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,399
Let me tell you something.

164
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,840
Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap.

165
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,279
- Nice earrings.
- Thank you.

166
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,879
Girls, sit down.

167
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,480
Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe,
and Rachel…

168
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,679
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I am parked at a meter. Let's do it.

169
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?

170
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,519
All right.

171
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,320
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

172
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,480
- Hi.
- Hey.

173
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,879
Guess what, guess what, guess what.

174
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,759
Okay. The fifth dentist caved, and
now they're all recommending Trident?

175
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,639
No, the interview.

176
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,960
She loved me.
She absolutely loved me.

177
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,639
We talked for, like,
two and a half hours.

178
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,399
We have the same taste in clothes.

179
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,519
I went to camp with her cousin.

180
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,399
And the job is perfect.
I can do this. I can do this well.

181
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,879
That's great.

182
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,759
God. And she told the funniest story.

183
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,799
Okay, great,
you'll tell us and we'll laugh.

184
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,639
Let's play poker.

185
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,120
All right, listen,
we talked about it

186
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,720
and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.

187
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,840
Yes. We can play some other game.
Like, I don't know…

188
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,399
Pictionary?

189
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,600
Very funny. Very funny.

190
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,120
think we'd like to give poker
another try. Shall we, ladies?

191
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,559
Yes, I think we should.

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,399
Rach,
do you want me to shuffle those?

193
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,080
No, no. That's okay. You know what?
I'm gonna give it a go.

194
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,240
- All right.
- All right.

195
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,000
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $10.

196
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,879
And, Rachel, you owe 15 big ones.

197
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,879
Thanks for teaching us
"Crossed-eyed Mary."

198
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,120
We gotta play that other way.

199
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,039
All right, here's my 7.50,

200
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,519
but I think you should know
that this money is cursed.

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,879
- What?
- I cursed it.

202
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.

203
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:02,840
That's all right, I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

204
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,480
This way, I can break them up
with a movie.

205
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,639
So that just leaves the big
Green poker machine, who owes 15.

206
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,080
It's so typical:

207
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,600
"Ooh, I'm a man.
Ooh, I have a penis."

208
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,320
"Ooh, I have to win money
to exert my power over women."

209
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,159
You know what? This is not over.

210
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:28,600
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.

211
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,440
And you will beg and we will laugh.

212
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,360
And we will take
every last dime you have.

213
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,120
And you will hate yourselves forever.

214
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

215
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,039
So you gals wanna hand over
your money now?

216
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,039
That way, we don't have to go through
the formality of actually playing.

217
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,960
No, that's fine. We'll see who has
the last laugh there, monkey boy.

218
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,960
Okay, are we done with the chitchat?
Are we ready to play serious poker?

219
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:05,519
You guys, look. The one-eyed jack
follows me wherever I go.

220
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,919
Right, okay. Serious poker.

221
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,360
Excuse me.
Where are you going?

222
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,799
To the bathroom.

223
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,240
Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or do you wanna play poker?

224
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
I wanna go to the bathroom.

225
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,799
- All right, I'm gonna order a pizza.
- Oh, no, no, no.

226
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm waiting to hear from that job.

227
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,799
And the store closes at 9,
so you can eat then.

228
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,440
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac
to hold me over.

229
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,559
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.

230
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,480
Yes.

231
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,600
Or no.

232
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,039
All right.

233
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,759
Your money's mine, Green.

234
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,399
Your fly's open, Geller.

235
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,759
You guys,
you know what I just realized?

236
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,759
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J."

237
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,559
Coincidence?

238
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,519
Hey, that's "jo-incidence"
with a "C."

239
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,960
- Phoebe. Phoebe…
- Yeah, I'm out.

240
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,080
I'm in.

241
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,399
Me too.

242
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,120
Me too. All right.
What do you got?

243
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,200
Well, you better hop out of
the shower, because I got a flush.

244
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,960
Well, well, well.

245
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:40,600
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes.

246
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,519
I got four sixes.
I won. I actually won.

247
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,519
Oh, my God.
You know what?

248
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,759
I think I'm gonna make
a little Ross pile.

249
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,960
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think, oh, that one was Ross'.

250
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,200
Well, I have got your money.
And you'll never see it.

251
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
And your fly's still open.

252
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,519
I made you look.

253
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,919
- I'm in.
- I couldn't be inner.

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,799
Monica? Monica, in or out?

255
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,639
I hate this game.

256
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,759
Okay, Joey, your bet.

257
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,200
I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach

258
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,960
by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

259
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,720
I'm out.

260
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,039
- Ross?
- I'm very in.

261
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,120
- Chandler?
- Couldn't be more out.

262
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,480
Me too. Rachel?

263
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,200
I will see you and I'll raise you.

264
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,039
What do you say?
You wanna waste another buck?

265
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,759
No, not this time.

266
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,000
- So, what did you have?
- I'm not telling.

267
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,279
- Come on, show them to me.
- No.

268
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,759
- Show them to me. Let me see.
- Get your hands out of there.

269
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,519
I've had dates like this.

270
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,279
Boy, you really can't stand to lose,
can you?

271
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,879
Your whole face is getting red.

272
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,320
Little veins popping out
of your temple.

273
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,759
Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

274
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,639
First of all, I'm not losing.

275
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,799
- Just deal.
- Hello? Rachel Green.

276
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,840
Excuse me.

277
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,360
It's about the job.

278
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,399
Barbara, hi. How are you?

279
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:36,960
No, I understand.

280
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,720
Yeah, oh, come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.

281
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,240
Yeah. Oh, but you know,
if anything else opens up, please…

282
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Hello?

283
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,480
Sorry, Rach.

284
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,920
Yeah, you know,
there's gonna be lots of other stuff.

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,480
Yeah. Okay.

286
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,880
Where were we? Oh. Okay.

287
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,119
Five card draw.
Uh, jacks are better.

288
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,440
Nothing wild, everybody ante.

289
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,279
Look, Rach,
we don't have to do this.

290
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,519
Yes, we do.

291
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
- All right. Check.
- Check.

292
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm in for 50 cents.

293
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,000
- Call.
- I'm in.

294
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,279
I see your 50 cents…

295
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,319
and I raise you…

296
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,480
$5.

297
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,960
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

298
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,079
Well, I just lost a job, and
I'd like to raise the bet 5 bucks.

299
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,079
Does anybody have a problem
with that?

300
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,839
- Not at all.
- No, no.

301
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,279
Loser?

302
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,039
No, I fold.

303
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,920
What do you mean, you fold?
Hey, come on, what is this?

304
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,319
I thought that, "Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy."

305
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,799
I mean, what?
Were you just full of it?

306
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,599
I'm in.

307
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,359
- How many you want?
- One.

308
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,640
Dealer takes two.

309
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,799
- What do you bet?
- I bet $2.

310
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,279
Okay.

311
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,880
See your 2,

312
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,440
and I raise you…

313
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,079
20.

314
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,920
I see your 20,

315
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,799
raise you 25.

316
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
See your 25…

317
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,400
and, uh, Monica, get my purse.

318
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,319
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

319
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,799
Okay, then get me your purse.

320
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,319
Okay. Here you go. Good luck.

321
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Thank you.

322
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,359
I saw your 25 and I raise you…

323
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,519
7.

324
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,599
Teen…

325
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,480
Joey, I'm a little shy.

326
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,839
That's okay, Ross.
You can ask me.

327
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,039
- What do you need?
- Fifteen.

328
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,200
- All right, here's 10.
- Here, I got 5, I got 5.

329
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,519
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

330
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,839
Okay, I am calling your 17.

331
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,400
What do you got?

332
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,240
Full house.

333
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,839
You got me.

334
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,519
- That's a tough hand to beat.
- I thought we had them.

335
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,359
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards, you know?

336
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,680
But look how happy she is.

337
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,759
- Airmail.
- Airplane. Airport.

338
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:04,519
Airport '75.
Airport '77. Airport '79.

339
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,319
Time's up.

340
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,640
Bye Bye Birdie.

341
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,559
That's a bird?

342
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,079
That's a bird.

343
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,319
Okay, okay, it's my turn.

344
