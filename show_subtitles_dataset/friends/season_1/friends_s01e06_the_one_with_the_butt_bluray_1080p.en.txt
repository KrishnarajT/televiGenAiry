1
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,320
Look! There's Joey's picture!
This is so exciting!

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,039
You can spot someone
who's never seen his plays.

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:14,759
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,480
The exclamation point scares me.
It's not just Freud, it's Freud!

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
Magic is about to happen!

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, Eva,

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,719
we've done
some excellent work here.

8
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,240
And I would have to say,
your problem is quite clear.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,560
All you want is a dinkle

10
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,880
What you envy's a schwang

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,280
<i>A thing through
which you can tinkle</i>

12
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,840
To play with or simply let hang

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,879
I feel violated.

14
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,640
Did anybody else feel like
peeling their skin off,

15
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,680
to have something else to do?

16
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,280
- Ross, 10:00.
- Is it? It feels like 2.

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,280
- No, 10:00!
- What?

18
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,879
There's a beautiful woman
at 8, 9, 10:00!

19
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,280
- Hello!
- She's amazing!

20
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,960
She makes the women I dream about
look like short, fat, bald men.

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,960
Go over to her.
She's not with anyone.

22
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,919
And what would my opening line be?
Excuse me…

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,199
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Could she be more out of my league?
Ross, back me up.

25
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,080
He could never get a woman
like that in a million years.

26
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,879
But you always see these beautiful
women with these "nothing" guys.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,879
You could be one of those guys.

28
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,599
- You could do that.
- You think?

29
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,039
Absolutely!

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,400
I can't believe
I'm even considering this.

31
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:48,120
- I'm very aware of my tongue.
- Come on.

32
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,520
Here goes.

33
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,639
Yes?

34
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,879
Hi.

35
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:00,199
Okay, next word would be…

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Chandler.

37
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,159
Chandler is my name and…

38
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,840
Hi!

39
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,719
Yes, you said that.

40
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,039
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say…

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,000
What I wanted to say was…

42
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,280
Would you like to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

43
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,080
Chandler?

44
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,639
There he is!

45
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,680
- I didn't know you could dance!
- You were in a play!

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,280
What'd you think?

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,120
- I didn't know you could dance!
- You were in a play!

48
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,919
Come on, it wasn't that bad.
I was the lead.

49
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,240
It was better than the troll thing.
At least you got to see my head.

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,439
- You're right.
- We saw your head.

51
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,120
She said yes!

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,759
Awful play, man!

53
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,719
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian and
she pronounces my name "Chandler."

54
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,919
I like that better. The usher
gave me this to give to you.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,080
- What is it?
- The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

56
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,879
An agency left me its card.
Maybe they wanna sign me!

57
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,120
Based on this play?

58
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,560
Based on this play!

59
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,360
- Hey, kids!
- Hey, Chandler.

60
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,839
No, because this line is passion,
and this is just a line.

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,519
I've been here seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,639
- How was your date, Chandler?
- It was unbelievable!

63
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,519
I've never met anyone like her.
She's had the most amazing life!

64
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,040
She was in the Israeli army.

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,879
None of the bullets hit the engine
block, so we made it to the border.

66
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,879
But just barely and I…

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,879
I've been talking about myself
all night long. I'm sorry.

68
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,879
What about you?
Tell me your stories.

69
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,879
All right, once,

70
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,720
once I got on the subway, right?

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,519
And it was at night,

72
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,279
and I rode it
all the way to Brooklyn,

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,879
just for the hell of it.

74
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,160
We talked till 2.
It was this perfect evening.

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,439
More or less.

76
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,720
Suddenly,
we realized we were in Yemen.

77
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,879
- I'm sorry, so "we" is?
- "We" is me and Rick.

78
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,240
- Who's Rick?
- Who's Rick?

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
My husband.

80
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,040
- So you're divorced?
- No.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,079
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
Hopefully?

82
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,639
No, I'm still married.

83
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,480
So how would your husband feel
about you sitting here with me,

84
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,240
sliding your foot
so far up my leg,

85
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,680
you can count
the change in my pocket?

86
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,399
Don't worry.

87
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,600
I imagine he'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,399
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

89
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,360
Ethan is my…

90
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,879
boyfriend.

91
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,959
What?

92
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,560
So, what kind of relationship
do you imagine us having,

93
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,600
if you already have
a husband and a boyfriend?

94
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,720
I suppose, mainly sexual.

95
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

96
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,279
What not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,680
Didn't you listen to the story?

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,879
How could you get involved
with a woman like this?

99
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,600
I had trouble with it at first,
but I get all the good stuff.

100
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,079
All the fun, all the talking,
all the sex,

101
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,680
and no responsibility.

102
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,160
This is every guy's fantasy!

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,600
That is not true.
Ross, is this your fantasy?

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,480
No, of course not.

105
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,439
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

106
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,680
You'd go out with someone else
who's going out with someone else?

107
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,160
- I couldn't.
- Good for you.

108
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,720
When I'm with a woman,
I need to know

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,480
that I'm going out
with more people than she is.

110
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,279
You know,
monogamy can be a tricky concept.

111
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,759
Anthropologically…

112
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,240
- Fine. Now you'll never know.
- We're kidding. Tell us.

113
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,000
- We wanna know.
- Come on!

114
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:16,639
All right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey…

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,360
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I like that.

116
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,759
Look! I cleaned!
I did the windows. I did the floors.

117
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,519
I used all the attachments on
the vacuum except for that round one.

118
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,879
I don't know what it's for.

119
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,639
Nobody knows,
and we're not supposed to ask.

120
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,519
What do you think?

121
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,360
- It's very clean.
- Really, it looks great!

122
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,000
I see you moved the green ottoman.

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,360
How did that happen?

124
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,120
I don't know.
I thought it looked better there.

125
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:07,519
And also, it's an extra seat
around the coffee table.

126
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,959
Yeah, it's interesting.

127
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,480
But you know what?
Just for fun,

128
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,279
let's see what it looked like
in the old spot.

129
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Just to compare.

130
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,519
Let's see.

131
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,319
It looks good there too.

132
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,800
Let's leave it there for a while.

133
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,879
I can't believe you tried to move
the green ottoman.

134
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,320
Thank God you didn't
fan out the magazines.

135
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,720
She'll scratch your eyes out.

136
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,840
- You guys, I am not that bad!
- Yeah, you are.

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,480
Remember, I lived with you?
You were a little, you know…

138
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,879
That is so unfair!

139
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,480
When we were kids,

140
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,840
yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll
that wasn't raggedy.

141
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,200
Okay, so I'm responsible.
I'm organized.

142
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,039
But, hey, I can be a kook!

143
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,320
All right, you madcap gal!

144
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,320
Try to imagine this.

145
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,879
The phone bill arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

146
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,600
- Why not?
- Because you're a kook!

147
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,279
Instead, you wait
until they send you a notice.

148
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,519
I could do that.

149
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
Okay, then you let me
go grocery shopping,

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,480
and I buy laundry detergent.

151
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:28,440
But it's not the one
with the easy-pour spout.

152
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,519
Why would someone do that?

153
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,679
One might wonder.

154
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,759
A glass is on the table.
There's no coaster.

155
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,480
It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.

156
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,279
Beads of condensation are inching
their way closer to the wood…

157
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,799
Stop it!

158
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,559
Oh, my God!
It's true. Who am I?

159
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,039
Monica, you're Mom.

160
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,080
Oh, my God!

161
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,240
Okay.

162
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,279
Okay, I'll be there.

163
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,080
That was my agent.

164
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,519
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new Al Pacino movie!

165
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,200
That's great!

166
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,679
- What's the part?
- Can you believe this? Al Pacino!

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,879
This guy's why I became an actor.

168
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,120
"I'm out of order?
You're out of order!

169
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,080
"This whole courtroom's
out of order!"

170
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,639
Seriously, what's the part?

171
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,440
"Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in!"

172
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,679
Come on. Seriously,
Joey, what's the part?

173
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,080
You're…
What?

174
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm his butt double, okay?

175
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,519
I play Al Pacino's butt.

176
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,799
All right? He goes into the shower,
and then…

177
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,480
I'm his butt.

178
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,879
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, you guys.

179
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,320
This is a real movie,
and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!

180
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,399
No, it's terrific. You deserve this.
After all your years of struggling,

181
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,480
you've finally been able to crack
your way into show business.

182
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,399
Okay, fine. Make jokes, I don't care.
This is a big break for me!

183
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,200
You're right. It is.

184
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,080
So are you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

185
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,279
- I need to borrow some moisturizer.
- For what?

186
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,200
What do you think?
Today's the big day!

187
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,559
Okay, go into the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

188
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,240
Just don't ever tell me
what you did in there.

189
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,759
Thank you.

190
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,720
- Joey's mom's on the phone.
- He's in the bathroom.

191
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,039
- You don't wanna go in there!
- Come on, we're roommates.

192
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,080
My eyes!

193
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,960
I warned you.

194
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,360
- Who is being loud?
- That would be Monica.

195
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,240
Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

196
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,159
You got the whole night?

197
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,639
I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so…

198
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,759
Do I sense a bit of resentment?

199
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,440
No. No resentment.
Believe me, it's worth it, okay?

200
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,600
In a relationship,
you have these key moments

201
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,960
you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

202
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
Every single second
is like that with Aurora.

203
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,960
And I've just wasted 35 of them
talking to you.

204
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,240
So, Monica,
can you help me with the door?

205
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,000
Chandler, the old Monica
would remind you

206
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,639
to scrub that Teflon pan
with a plastic brush.

207
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,519
But I'm not gonna do that.

208
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,639
Damn it! Hire the girl.

209
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,879
Okay, everybody ready?

210
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,120
I just wanna thank you
for this great opportunity.

211
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,639
Lose the robe.

212
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,799
- Me?
- That would work.

213
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,039
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!

214
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,360
Okay, and the robe is lost.

215
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.

216
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,840
Let's roll it.
Water's working.

217
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,000
And action!

218
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,679
And cut!

219
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,399
Butt guy, what are you doing?

220
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,399
- I'm showering.
- No, that was clenching.

221
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,840
The way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

222
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,440
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

223
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,039
I think his butt would be angry here.

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,960
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.

225
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,240
Once again, rolling.
Water working.

226
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,039
And action!

227
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,639
And cut! What was that?

228
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,200
I was going for quiet desperation.

229
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,240
But if you have to ask…

230
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,759
- God, I love these fingers.
- Thank you.

231
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,440
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

232
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,840
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

233
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,679
- Oh, my God, I'm late!
- No.

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,720
- Don't go.
- Okay.

235
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,519
- I have to.
- She's leaving.

236
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,879
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.

237
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,679
- I thought you talked to Rick.
- It's not Rick.

238
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,960
Ethan?
He gets the whole day with you!

239
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,559
No, it's Andrew.

240
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,039
I know there'll be many moments,

241
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,240
when I'll regret asking
the following question, but…

242
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,960
- And Andrew is?
- He's new.

243
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,120
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

244
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,039
No, that's not exactly what I was…

245
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,759
Most women would kill
for three guys like us.

246
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,360
So, what do you want?

247
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,200
You.

248
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,879
- You have me.
- No. Just you.

249
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,240
- What do you mean?
- Lose the other guys.

250
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,639
Like, all of them?

251
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,360
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?

252
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,720
Why can't we just have
what we have now?

253
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:38,080
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love,

254
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,000
without feeling obligated
to one another?

255
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,840
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

256
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,519
Part of me wants that,
but it's like I'm two guys.

257
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,240
One guy's saying,
"Shut up! This is great!"

258
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,200
But there's this other guy.

259
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,679
It's the guy who wells up every time
the Grinch's heart grows three sizes

260
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,720
and breaks that measuring device.

261
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,879
He's saying,
"This is too hard. Get out!"

262
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,200
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?

263
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:14,799
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.

264
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,679
Which one?

265
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,440
The second guy.

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,240
I see.

267
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,639
Call me if you change your mind.

268
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,039
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

269
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,120
Look at it this way.
You dumped her!

270
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,240
Right? This woman was
unbelievably sexy,

271
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,799
and beautiful, intelligent,
unattainable…

272
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,839
Tell me why you did this again?

273
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
- Hey!
- Hey!

274
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,720
Movie star!

275
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,240
Aren't you the guy who plays
the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

276
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,440
- Nope.
- No? What happened, big guy?

277
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,640
Big guy?

278
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,839
It felt like a "big guy" moment.

279
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,119
I got fired!

280
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,799
They said I acted too much with it.

281
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,279
I told everybody about this.

282
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,359
Everybody will be expecting
to see me.

283
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,039
You know what?
No one will be able to tell.

284
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,839
My mom will.

285
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,039
There's something so sweet,
and disturbing about that.

286
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,079
I've done nothing
but crappy plays for six years,

287
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,400
and I finally get my shot,
and I blow it!

288
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,279
Maybe this wasn't your shot.

289
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,640
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

290
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,880
Did it feel like your shot?

291
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,680
Hard to tell. I was naked.

292
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,440
I don't think this was your shot.

293
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,640
I don't even think
you just get one shot.

294
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,079
I really believe big things
are gonna happen for you. I do.

295
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,240
You've gotta keep thinking about
the day that some kid will go,

296
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,759
"I got the part! I'm gonna be
Joey Tribbiani's ass!"

297
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,440
You think? That's so nice.

298
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,119
Come here.

299
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,200
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

300
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,319
Good night.

301
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,720
You're gonna leave
your shoes out here?

302
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:56,240
Really? Just casually strewn about
in that reckless, haphazard manner?

303
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,160
It doesn't matter.
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

304
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,440
Whenever.

305
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,640
She is a kook.

306
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
<i>If it bothers you that much,
just go out and get the shoes.</i>

307
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,720
No, don't do this!

308
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,319
This is stupid!

309
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,519
<i>I don't have to prove anything.
I'm gonna go get them.</i>

310
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,960
But then everyone will know.

311
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,519
<i>Unless I get them, and then wake up
really early and put them back.</i>

312
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,400
I need help!
