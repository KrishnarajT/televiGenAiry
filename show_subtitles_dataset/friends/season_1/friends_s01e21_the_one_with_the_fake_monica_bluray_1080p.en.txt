1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:05,160
When somebody steals
your credit card

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,080
they've kind of already
thrown caution to the wind.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,000
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,960
That's me.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,480
The yuck.
Ross, he's doing it again!

6
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,879
Marcel, stop humping the lamp!

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,280
Stop humping!
Now, Marcel, come back!

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,600
Come here, Marcel!

9
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'll get him.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,920
Ross, you've got to do something
about the humping.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,200
What? It's just a phase.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920
Well, that's what we said about Joey.

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,399
Hey, would you all relax?
It's not that big a deal.

14
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,880
Marcel, stop it!
Marcel! Bad monkey!

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,119
What?

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,920
Let's just say my Curious George doll
is no longer curious.

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,879
Monica, you are not still
going over that thing.

18
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,599
- This woman's living my life.
- What?

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,560
She's living my life,
and she's doing it better than me.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,040
Look at this. Look.

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,799
She buys tickets
to plays I want to see.

22
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,120
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the salespeople.

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,799
She spent $300 on art supplies.

24
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,239
You're not an artist.

25
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,120
Yeah, well, I might be
if I had the supplies.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,039
I mean, I could do all this stuff.
Only I don't.

27
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,039
Monica, come on.
You do cool things.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,080
Oh, really?
Let's compare, shall we?

29
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,599
It's so late for "shall we?"

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,639
Do I go horseback riding
in the park?

31
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,759
Do I take classes at The New School?

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,680
- No.
- No.

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,639
This is so unfair.

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,919
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,280
How about Joey Paponi?

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,080
No, still too ethnic.

37
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,439
My agent thinks I should have a name
that's more neutral.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,199
Joey Switzerland?

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,240
Plus I think it should be Joe.
Joey makes me sound like I'm…

40
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,599
…this big.

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,759
Which I'm not!

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,400
Joe, Joe, Joe… Stalin?

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,599
Stalin.

44
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,120
Stalin… Do I know that name?
That sounds familiar.

45
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,680
Well, it does not ring a bell
with me.

46
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,759
Joe Stalin.

47
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,639
You know, that's pretty good.

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,240
You might want to try Joseph.

49
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,840
Joseph Stalin!

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,520
- I think you'd remember that!
- Oh, yes!

51
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,919
Bye Bye Birdie,
starring Joseph Stalin.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,439
Joseph Stalin is
the Fiddler on the Roof.

53
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,759
- Hey.
- Hey.

54
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,000
Hi.

55
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,240
Hi. Yes, this is Monica Geller.

56
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,400
I'm taking classes with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

57
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,199
What are you doing?

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,680
All right, great.

59
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,759
Great. Thanks a lot.

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,680
I'm going to tap class.

61
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,879
So you can dance with the woman
that stole your card?

62
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,439
This woman got my life.
I should get to see who she is.

63
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,680
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

64
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,600
Monica, honey,
you're kind of losing it here.

65
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,480
This is really becoming
a weird obsession.

66
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,399
This is madness, I tell you.

67
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,399
For the love of God, Monica,
don't do it!

68
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,759
Thank you.

69
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,519
What do you think?

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,439
Lots of things.

71
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,160
Which one do you think she is?

72
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,079
- May I help you?
- Oh, no, thanks.

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,959
We're just here to observe.

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,800
You don't observe a dance class.
You dance a dance class!

75
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,079
Spare shoes are over there.

76
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,720
What does she mean?

77
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,639
I think she means, "You dance…

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,439
…a dance class!"

79
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,360
Come on, come on, come on!

80
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,839
Really?

81
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey, do you see anybody
you think could be me?

82
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,639
People, last time there were yogurt
containers lying around after class.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,360
Let's not have that happen again!

84
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,800
She could be you.

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,480
Let's get started.

86
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,920
Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.

87
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,399
Okay, I'm not getting this!

88
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm totally getting it!

89
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,920
Do you ever just feel like you're
so unbelievably uncoordinated?

90
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,519
What? You just click when they click.

91
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,720
All right, people.
Now everyone grab a partner.

92
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,040
All right. And my dead mother
said you are it!

93
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,639
I'm with Rachel.

94
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,240
Great, it's gym class all over again.

95
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,040
That's all right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

96
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,079
Why don't I just take off my clothes
and have a nightmare?

97
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,839
It's okay, it's okay!
I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.

98
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,160
Okay, here I am.

99
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
So who's the new tense girl?

100
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,360
She's your partner.

101
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,040
- Hi, I'm Monica.
- Hi.

102
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,839
Monica.

103
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,079
Hi, I'm Mon…

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Nana.

105
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,480
- Monana?
- Yeah.

106
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,600
It's Dutch.

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,079
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

108
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,600
Pennsylvania Dutch.

109
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,120
And we're dancing!

110
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,759
Five, six, seven, eight.

111
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,800
Hi.

112
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,240
- Hey.
- Hey.

113
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,560
- Where have you been?
- I just got back from the vet.

114
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,040
She's not gonna make you wear
a big plastic cones, is she?

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,000
She says Marcel's humping thing
is not a phase.

116
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,120
Apparently,
he's reached sexual maturity.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,079
Hey, he beat you!

118
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,480
She says, as time goes on, he'll
start getting aggressive and violent.

119
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,079
What does this mean?

120
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,759
I have to give him up.

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,319
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!

122
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,839
I don't get it. You just got him.
How could he be an adult already?

123
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,160
I know, I know.
One day he's this little thing

124
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,720
and before you know it,
he's this little thing…

125
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,240
I can't get off my leg.

126
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

127
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,639
No. No.

128
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,480
The vet said that unless he's in
a place where he has regular access

129
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,559
to some monkey loving…

130
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,639
…he's just gonna get vicious.

131
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,399
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

132
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,879
- How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
- I know that one!

133
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,000
No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.

134
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,879
We're applying to a lot of them. Our
first choice would be a state zoo.

135
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,399
You know, like, San Diego.

136
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,799
Right?

137
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,960
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

138
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,480
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibility.

139
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,840
But that's two blocks from the beach.
It's a total party zoo.

140
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

141
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,480
- Hi.
- We found the girl!

142
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,200
- What?
- Did you call the cops?

143
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,720
Nope. We took her to lunch.

144
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,480
Your own brand
of vigilante justice.

145
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,799
Are you insane?
This woman stole from you!

146
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,279
She stole! She's a stealer!

147
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,000
After you're with this woman
for 10 minutes, you forget all that.

148
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,480
I mean, she's this
astounding person

149
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,759
with this amazing spirit!

150
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,759
Yeah, which she probably stole
from some cheerleader!

151
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,240
- Take off their hats.
- Popes in a Volkswagen!

152
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,480
I love that joke.

153
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,639
- No way! No way did you do this!
- Monana was very brave.

154
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,480
It was so wild.

155
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:17,480
We told them we were
the Gunnersons in room 615,

156
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,360
only to find out the Boston Celtics
had the entire sixth floor!

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
So when they caught on to the fact
that we're short and have breasts…

158
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,919
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Go, Monana!

160
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,559
Well, you ladies are not
the only ones living the dream.

161
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,240
I get to go pour coffee for people
I don't know. Don't wait up.

162
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,600
By the way…

163
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,759
Tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

164
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,320
Excuse me?

165
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,120
There's an open call for Cats.

166
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing "Memories"

167
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,960
and make complete fools of
ourselves. What do you say?

168
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,039
No, no, no.

169
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,759
Remember who
you're dealing with here.

170
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,960
I'm not like you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap class.

171
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,879
That's because of
your Amish background.

172
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,919
- What?
- You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,120
Right.

174
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,480
Till I bought a blow dryer.
Then I was shunned.

175
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,759
I was just like you.

176
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,559
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my life.

177
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,679
Did you ever see
Dead Poets Society?

178
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,360
I thought that movie was
so incredibly…

179
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
…boring!

180
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,120
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid

181
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,600
kills himself because
he can't be in the play?

182
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,840
What was that?

183
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,279
It's like, "Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater!"

184
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,279
I walked out of there, and I thought:

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,720
"Now, that's two hours of my life
that I'm never getting back!"

186
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,240
And that scared me more than all
the other crap I was afraid to do.

187
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,279
Then I would definitely
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

188
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,919
Oh, God!

189
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,440
We didn't get into Scranton.

190
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,000
That was our safety zoo.

191
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,720
They take, like, dogs and cows.

192
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,159
See?

193
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,480
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

194
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,080
I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.

195
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,039
Marcel. Marcel.

196
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,279
Marcel, no.

197
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,519
Good boy!

198
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,679
See? How can nobody want him?

199
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,519
Somebody will.

200
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,960
You know there already is
a Joseph Stalin?

201
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,080
You're kidding!

202
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,480
Apparently, he was this
Russian dictator

203
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,360
who slaughtered all these people!

204
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,799
You'd think you would've known that!

205
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,440
You'd think I would've.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,919
Phoebe, what do you think
a good stage name for me would be?

207
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,080
Flame Boy!

208
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,240
Where exactly is your zoo?

209
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,039
Well,
it's technically not a zoo per se.

210
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,679
It's more of an interactive
wildlife experience.

211
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,240
Let me ask you some
questions about…

212
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Is it, uh, Marcel?

213
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

214
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,879
Does he fight with other animals?

215
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,840
No, no. He's very docile.

216
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,120
Even if he were cornered?

217
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,559
Well, I don't know. Why?

218
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,480
How is he at handling
small objects?

219
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,200
He can hold a banana,
if that's what you mean.

220
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,159
What about a hammer or a small blade?

221
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,519
Why would he need a blade?

222
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,639
If he's up against a jungle cat
or an animal with horns

223
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,799
you got to give
the little guy something.

224
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,000
Otherwise, it's just cruel!

225
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,120
He got into San Diego!

226
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,399
- What?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,679
We were coming back from our walk,
and the phone was ringing…

228
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,399
- He's in!
- He's in?

229
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,320
Did you hear that, Marcel?

230
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,159
San Diego! San Diego! Yeah!

231
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,320
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's well and good,

232
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,679
but if you give him to me,
I'll start him against a blind rabbit

233
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,600
and give you 20 percent
of the gate.

234
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,240
Where have you been?

235
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,240
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

236
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,519
Are you drunk?

237
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,039
No!

238
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,120
I'm lying.

239
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,399
I am so drunk!

240
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,679
Oh, God!

241
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,559
Great. You know what?
You could have called.

242
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,559
I've been up here.
I've been worried…

243
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,039
Monica.

244
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,840
Monica?

245
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,360
Water rules!

246
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,919
Yes. Yes, it does.

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,039
Ok, look…
The restaurant called again.

248
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,159
They want to know if you're gona be
showing up for work.

249
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,799
Nope!

250
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,240
I'm going to the Big Apple Circus
today.

251
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,720
Monica, what are you doing?

252
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,279
You're gonna lose your job.
This is not you!

253
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,120
No, it is me!

254
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,200
I'm not just the person
who needs to fluff the pillows

255
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,759
and pay the bills
as soon as they come in!

256
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,440
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

257
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,039
I'm…

258
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,679
I'm Monana!

259
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,799
Hello?

260
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,799
Yes, she is.
Hold on a second, please.

261
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,840
Monana, it's for you.

262
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,759
The credit card people.

263
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,120
Hello?

264
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,200
Yes?

265
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,440
Oh, my God!

266
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,720
Thanks.

267
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,279
What?

268
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,639
They've arrested Monica.

269
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,120
- Hi.
- Hey.

270
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,840
How are you?

271
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,399
I'm not too bad.
Fortunately, blue's my color.

272
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,039
How did you know I was here?

273
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,519
Because…

274
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,519
I'm Monica Geller.

275
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,720
It was my credit card you were using.

276
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,160
That I was not expecting.

277
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,680
I want you to know,
I didn't turn you in.

278
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,680
- Thanks.
- No, thank you.

279
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,079
You have given me so much.

280
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,319
If it wasn't for you,
I'd never have gotten

281
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,039
to sing "Memories"
at the Winter Garden Theater.

282
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,079
Actually, you only got to sing
"Memo…"

283
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,319
I can't believe you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

284
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,920
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,079
Who's gonna take me
to the Big Apple Circus?

286
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,079
Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women

287
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,240
and you're worried about who will
take you to the Big Apple Circus?

288
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,039
Well, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

289
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,599
There's nothing to wonder about.

290
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,240
You'll go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

291
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,000
- Not necessarily.
- Yes, necessarily.

292
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,920
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

293
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm not actually Amish.

294
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,400
Really?
Then why are you like that?

295
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
You by the door, in or out?

296
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,559
In!

297
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,759
You in the back,
you're getting it wrong!

298
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,680
At least I'm doing it!

299
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,720
<i>This is the final boarding
call for Flight 67 to San Diego</i>

300
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,119
boarding at Gate 42A.

301
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,559
Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.

302
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,880
I wrote you this poem.

303
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,640
Okay, but don't eat it
till you get on the plane.

304
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,400
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

305
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,799
Okay, bye, champ.

306
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,720
There's gonna be a lot of babes
in San Diego,

307
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,119
but remember,
there's also a lot to learn.

308
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,319
I don't know what to say, Ross.
Uh, it's a monkey.

309
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,480
Just say what you feel, Joey.

310
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,160
Marcel, I'm hungry.

311
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
That was good.

312
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,640
Marcel, this is for you.

313
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,359
It's just, you know,
something to…

314
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,119
…do on the plane.

315
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,880
If you don't mind,
I'd like a moment, just me and him.

316
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,759
- Sure.
- Of course. Absolutely.

317
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:07,200
Marcel, come here.
Come here.

318
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,000
Come here.

319
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,559
Well, buddy…

320
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,000
This is it.

321
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,000
There's just a couple of things
I wanted to say.

322
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm really gonna miss you.

323
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,960
You know? And I'm never gonna
forget about you.

324
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:28,640
You've been more
than just a pet to me.

325
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,519
You've been more like a…

326
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,559
Okay. Marcel, would you…

327
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,640
Marcel,
would you leave my leg alone?

328
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,240
Would you just stop humping me
for two seconds?

329
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,319
Marc… Would you…

330
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,960
Okay, would you just take him away?
Just take him.

331
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,799
That I were a glove
upon that hand,

332
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,519
that I might touch thy cheek.

333
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,240
That's fine. Thank you.

334
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,960
Next.

335
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:22,359
Hi. I'll be reading
for the role of Mercutio.

336
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,200
- Name?
- Holden McGroin.
