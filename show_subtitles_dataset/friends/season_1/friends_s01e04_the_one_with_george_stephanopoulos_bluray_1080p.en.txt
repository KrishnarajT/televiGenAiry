1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,399
That's good.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,320
- Okay. All right, Phoebe?
- Okay.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,560
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,720
no more hunger,
good things for the rain forest.

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:14,000
And bigger boobs.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,120
Well, see, you took mine, so…

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,719
Chandler, what about you?

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,239
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
See, there's always one guy.

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,199
"If I had a wish,
I'd wish for three more wishes."

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,359
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, buddy.

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,359
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,000
Probably kill myself.

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,759
Excuse me?

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,240
If Little Joey's dead, then
I got no reason to live, you know?

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,359
Joey, omnipotent.

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,039
You are?

18
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,679
Ross, I'm…

19
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,359
- How does she do that?
- I cannot sleep in a public place.

20
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,519
Would you look at her?

21
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:53,040
- She's so peaceful.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,840
What? Hi.

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,879
It's okay.
You just nodded off again.

24
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,840
What's going on with you?

25
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,879
- I got no sleep last night.
- Why?

26
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,719
My grandmother
has this new boyfriend,

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,800
and they're both kind of insecure
in bed, so…

28
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,280
And deaf.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,400
So they're constantly
having to reassure each other

30
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,000
that they're having a good time.
You have no idea how loud they are.

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,719
You can stay
with Rachel and me tonight.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,000
Thanks.

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,039
Ninety-five, 96, 97.

34
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,439
See, I told you. Less than 100 steps
from our place to here.

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,319
You got way
too much free time, man.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
There's the birthday boy.

37
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,319
Ross, check it out.
Hockey tickets.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,919
Rangers-Penguins tonight
at the Garden. We're taking you.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,919
- Happy birthday, pal.
- We love you, man.

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,039
It's funny,
my birthday was seven months ago.

41
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,639
So?

42
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,319
So I'm guessing
you had an extra ticket,

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,120
and couldn't decide which one
of you got to bring a date?

44
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,400
Aren't we
Mr. The-Glass-is-Half-Empty?

45
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,280
Oh, my God.
Is today the 20th? October 20th?

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,879
I was hoping you wouldn't remember.

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,400
What's wrong with the 20th?

48
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,599
Eleven days before Halloween?
All the good costumes are gone?

49
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,280
Today's the day Carol and I
first consummated

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,319
our physical relationship.

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,840
We had sex.

52
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,080
You know what?
I better pass on the game.

53
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,520
I think I'm just gonna go home

54
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,960
and think about my ex-wife
and her lesbian lover.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,639
The hell with hockey.
Let's all do that.

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,800
Come on, Ross.
You, me, Joey, ice?

57
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,960
Guys' night out?
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

58
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,360
- What are you doing?
- I have no idea.

59
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,719
Come on, Ross.

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,520
All right.
Maybe it will take my mind off it.

61
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,639
You promise to buy me
a big foam finger?

62
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,719
You got it.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,879
- All right.
- Look. My first paycheck.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
Look at the window.
There's my name. Hi, me.

65
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,599
I remember the day
I got my first paycheck.

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,879
There was a cave-in in one of the
mines, and eight people were killed.

67
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,000
- You worked in a mine?
- No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,000
God, isn't this exciting?
I earned this.

69
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,560
I wiped tables for it.
I steamed milk for it.

70
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,920
And it was totally…

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,279
not worth it.

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,879
Who's FICA?
Why's he getting all my money?

73
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,000
What… Chandler, look at that.

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,720
This is not that bad.

75
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,720
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,759
- You can totally live on this.
- Yeah.

77
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,600
- By the way, great service today.
- Yeah.

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,160
- Terrific.
- It was excellent.

79
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,160
Unbelievable.
And all that milk and stuff? Great.

80
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,639
- Hockey.
- Hockey.

81
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,360
- Hockey.
- Hockey.

82
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,360
Rachel?

83
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,759
Oh, my God!

84
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,360
I swear I've seen birds do this
on Wild Kingdom.

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,560
What are you guys doing here?

86
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,800
We were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here,

87
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,040
and it's true.

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,040
Yeah.

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,160
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

90
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,600
God, look at you. You are so big.
I can't believe it.

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,040
I know. I'm a duplex.

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,879
So, what's going on with you?

93
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,519
Guess who my dad's making partner
in his firm.

94
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:57,240
And while we're on the subject
of news…

95
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,560
Look. I have elbows.

96
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,120
Passes it up to Leetch.

97
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,040
Leetch spots Messier in the crease.
Here's the pass.

98
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,160
We'll take a time-out while Messier
stops to look at some women's shoes.

99
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,839
Carol was wearing boots just
like those the night that we first,

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,439
you know.

101
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,120
In fact, she…
She never took them off.

102
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,680
It's because we… Sorry.

103
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,079
I can't believe…

104
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,079
- What?
- Peach pit.

105
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes, bunny?

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,319
Peach pit.

107
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:46,199
- That night, we had…
- Peaches?

108
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,560
Actually, nectarines, but basically.

109
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,720
- Could've been a peach.
- Then we…

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,920
Then we got dressed
and I walked her to the bus stop.

111
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,519
I'm fine.

112
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,560
That woman's got an ass
like Carol's.

113
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,920
What? I thought we were trying
to find stuff.

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,759
Come on, you guys.
Tell me all the dirt.

115
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,439
The biggest news is still
you dumping Barry at the altar.

116
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,279
All right,
let's talk reality for a second.

117
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,639
- When are you coming home?
- What?

118
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,879
Guys, I'm not.

119
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,839
- Come on. This is us.
- I'm not.

120
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,079
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

121
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,600
- Waitressing?
- I'm not just waitressing.

122
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,120
I'm…

123
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,720
I…

124
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,839
I write the specials
on the specials board.

125
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,040
And I take the dead flowers
out of the vase.

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,240
And sometimes Arturo lets me put
the little chocolate blobbies

127
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,360
on the cookies.

128
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:00,600
Your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,839
Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?

130
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,839
Okay, how would you like
some Tiki Death Punch?

131
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,000
What's that?

132
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,839
- It's rum and…
- Okay.

133
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,600
We thought since Phoebe's staying
over we'd have a slumber party.

134
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,080
We got some trashy magazines,
we got cookie dough, we got Twister.

135
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,000
And I brought Operation.

136
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,799
But I lost the tweezers,
so we can't operate.

137
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,159
But we can prep the guy.

138
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,279
- Rach, it's the Visa-card people.
- Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

139
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,480
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

140
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,480
Yes, hold on.

141
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,120
They say there's been unusual
activity on your account.

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,200
- But I haven't used my card in weeks.
- That is the unusual activity.

143
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,960
- They just wanna see if you're okay.
- They wanna know if I'm okay?

144
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,960
Okay, they wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay, let's see.

145
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,399
Let's see.
The FICA guys took all my money.

146
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,559
Everyone I know
is either getting married

147
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,879
or getting pregnant or getting
promoted, and I'm getting coffee.

148
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,080
And it's not even for me.

149
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,639
So if that sounds like I'm okay,

150
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,000
okay, then you can tell them
I'm okay. Okay?

151
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,480
Rachel has left the building.

152
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,960
- Can you call back?
- All right. Come on.

153
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,919
Let's play Twister.

154
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,960
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

155
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,399
What? There was ice there
that night with Carol?

156
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,320
Plastic seats?
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

157
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,960
No, actually, I was just saying

158
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,679
it looks like
we're not sitting together.

159
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,279
But now that you mention it,
there was ice there that night.

160
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,440
It was the first frost.

161
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,399
- We were…
- Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

162
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,039
You should feel great. You're doing
this amazing independent thing.

163
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,240
Monica, what is so amazing?

164
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,679
I gave up like everything.
And for what?

165
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,159
You are just like Jack.

166
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,039
Jack from downstairs?

167
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,879
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

168
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,559
- The other Jack.
- Yeah, right.

169
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,200
See, he gave up something,
but then he got those magic beans.

170
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:40,399
And then he woke up
and there was this big plant,

171
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,879
outside of his window,
full of possibilities and stuff.

172
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,399
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

173
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,399
Okay, but, Pheebs,
Jack gave up a cow.

174
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,759
I gave up an orthodontist.

175
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,200
Okay,
I know I didn't love him, but…

176
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,840
See, Jack did love the cow.

177
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
But, see, it was a plan, you know?
It was clear.

178
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,480
Everything was figured out, and
now everything's just kind of like…

179
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,440
- Flupie?
- Yeah.

180
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,679
You're not the only one.
We don't know where we're going.

181
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,480
You gotta figure, at some point,
it's gonna come together,

182
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,360
and it's just gonna be "unflupie."

183
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,879
Yeah, like that's a word.

184
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,279
Okay, but, Monica,
what if it doesn't come together?

185
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,919
Pheebs?

186
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,120
Because you just…
I don't like this question.

187
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,840
Okay, see? See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?

188
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,559
What if all we've got are

189
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,399
beans?

190
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,039
Get him! Get… Yes! You're not
laughing now, are you, pal?

191
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,639
That's all you need,

192
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,000
a bunch of toothless guys
hitting each other with sticks.

193
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,360
Pass it.

194
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,080
He's open.
Shoot it!

195
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,159
Look, we're on that TV thing.

196
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,720
- I got it!
- We got it!

197
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,120
Excuse me.

198
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,759
It says to call this number

199
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,879
if you're not completely satisfied
with this candy bar.

200
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm not completely satisfied.

201
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,440
Listen, it's kind of an emergency.

202
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,799
I guess you'd know that, or we'd be
in the predicament room.

203
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,039
Hold on.
Fill these out. Sit over there.

204
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,320
I don't wanna
make any trouble, okay?

205
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,600
But I'm in a lot of pain here,
all right? My face is dented.

206
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,679
- You'll have to wait your turn.
- How long do you think it'll be?

207
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,600
Any minute now.

208
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,519
Listen…

209
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:21,200
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

210
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,639
No, you were right.

211
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,519
I don't have a plan.

212
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,559
Pizza guy.

213
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,559
- Thank God.
- Food.

214
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,840
- Phoebe?
- What?

215
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,919
- Do you have a plan?
- I don't even have a "pla."

216
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,519
Hi. One mushroom,
green pepper and onion?

217
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,720
No. That's not what we ordered.

218
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,679
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese.

219
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,840
- You're not G. Stephanopoulos?
- No.

220
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,000
- Oh, man. My dad's gonna kill me.
- Wait.

221
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,360
Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

222
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,039
Yeah, this one goes across the
street. I must have given him yours.

223
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,240
Bonehead.

224
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,320
Wait, was this a small
Mediterranean guy

225
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,519
with curiously intelligent
good looks?

226
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,960
Yeah, that sounds about right.

227
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,840
- Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
- And a power tie?

228
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,480
- No, pretty much just a towel.
- Oh, God.

229
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,679
- Oh, my God.
- You want me to take this back?

230
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,360
What? Are you nuts? We've got
George Stephanopoulos' pizza.

231
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,320
Here.

232
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,519
- Pheebs?
- Yeah?

233
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,440
Who's George Snuffleupagus?

234
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
That's Big Bird's friend.

235
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,360
- I see pizza.
- I wanna see. Let me see.

236
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,480
Hello? Who are we spying on?

237
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,720
You know the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy?

238
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,159
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt?

239
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,200
Oh, him. The little guy.
I love him.

240
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,519
- Wait. Wait, I see a woman.
- Tell me it's his mother.

241
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,279
- Definitely not his mother.
- Oh, no.

242
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,559
Wait, she's walking across the floor.

243
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,200
She's walking…

244
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,639
She's going for the pizza.
That's not for you, bitch!

245
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,639
Dr. Max to Center 456.

246
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,240
Dr. Max to Center 456.

247
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,440
Excuse me.
We've been here for over an hour,

248
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,919
and people less sick than my friend
have gone in.

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,879
That guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

250
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:44,879
Come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

251
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,360
I know we both said some things
we didn't mean,

252
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,200
but that doesn't mean
we still don't love each other.

253
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,200
I feel like I've lost her.

254
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,039
- Lights still out?
- Yeah.

255
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,879
- Maybe they're napping.
- Please. They're having sex.

256
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,200
Shut up.

257
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,759
So, what do you think
George is like?

258
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,200
- I think he's shy.
- Yeah?

259
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,879
Yeah.
I think you have to draw him out.

260
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,679
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animal.

261
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,120
Come on.

262
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,639
I remember the moonlight coming in
through the open window,

263
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,159
and her face
had the most incredible glow.

264
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,399
Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling.

265
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
You did this part. Could I get some
painkillers over here, please?

266
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,879
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?

267
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,600
So you slept with her
for the first time. So what?

268
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,919
You slept with her
for seven years after that.

269
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,559
It's just a little more complicated
than that.

270
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,639
What? What is it? That she left you?
That she likes women?

271
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
That she left you for a woman
that likes women?

272
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
A little louder.

273
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:06,839
There's a man on the 12th floor
in a coma who didn't quite hear you.

274
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Then what?

275
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:15,160
My first time with Carol was…

276
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,559
Was my…

277
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:19,960
What?

278
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,319
It was my first time.

279
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,079
With Carol?

280
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,359
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one?

281
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh, boy.
Hockey was a big mistake.

282
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,880
There's a whole bunch of stuff
we could've done tonight.

283
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,519
Okay. Okay, I got one.

284
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,599
Do you remember that vegetarian pâté
that I made that you loved so much?

285
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,079
Unless goose is a vegetable…

286
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,119
Okay, fine.

287
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,640
Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

288
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,880
- What? You slept with Jason?
- You had already broken up.

289
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,440
- How long?
- Just a couple hours.

290
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,519
That's nice.

291
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,880
Okay, I got one.

292
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,960
Anyway.

293
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:27,519
The valentine Tommy Rollerson left
in your locker was really from me.

294
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,240
Excuse me?

295
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,319
Hello? Like he was
really gonna send you one.

296
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,720
She was a big girl.

297
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
Really?

298
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,559
At least big girls don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade.

299
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,559
I was laughing.
You made me laugh.

300
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,240
Oh, my God.
There he is.

301
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,319
Where?

302
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,720
Right where we've been looking
all night.

303
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,720
- He's so cute.
- George, baby, drop the towel.

304
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,039
- Come on, drop the towel.
- Drop the towel.

305
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,839
Please drop the towel.
Drop it.

306
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,839
Man, can you believe he's only
had sex with one woman?

307
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:17,519
I think it's great.
It's sweet. It's romantic.

308
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,720
Really?

309
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,920
No, are you kidding?
The guy's a freak. I judge him.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,359
- Hey, man.
- Hey, buddy.

311
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,240
That's attractive.

312
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,480
I thought you were great
in Silence of the Lambs.

313
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,079
Come on, admit it, all things
considered, you had fun tonight.

314
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,359
Fun? Where was the fun?

315
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,000
Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part?

316
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,359
Where's my puck?

317
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,039
- The kid has it.
- The kid?

318
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,960
Excuse me, that's my puck.

319
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,400
I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

320
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,720
You gotta do it, man.

321
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,599
Yeah? I'm rubber, you're glue.
Whatever you…

322
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,759
I can't do it.

323
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,920
- Listen, give me back my puck.
- No.

324
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,079
- Yes, how about?
- No.

325
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,119
- No, come here. Just give me my puck.
- No.

326
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,720
- No roughhousing in my ER.
- Give me my puck!

327
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,279
Now, that was fun.

328
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,519
Okay, Monica.

329
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:40,440
- Right foot, red.
- Could've played Monopoly, but no.

330
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,960
Thanks.

331
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,519
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

332
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,359
Good.

333
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,400
Hello?

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,799
- Rachel, it's the Visa-card people.
- Okay. Will you take my place?

335
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,240
- All right. Yes, this is Rachel.
- No.

336
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,599
Hello?

337
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,480
Yeah. No, I know.
I haven't been using it much.

338
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,039
Thanks, but I'm okay, really.

339
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,519
To the green.

340
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,839
- No.
- To the green.

341
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,079

342
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,880

343
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,240
To the left.

344
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I'm fine.
