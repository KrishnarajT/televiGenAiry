1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,759
Coffee.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:06,040
- Thank you.
- Cappuccino.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,879
Grazie!

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,199
And a nice hot cider for Monica.

5
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,919
Aw, thank you.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,839
- Rach?
- Yeah?

7
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,039
Why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,640
That's why.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,719
Sorry.

10
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,280
Chandler?

11
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,239
Miss Tedlock,
you're looking lovely today.

12
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,640
May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

13
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,680
Yes.

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,560
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

15
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,719
Listen, if this is about those prank
memos, I had nothing to do with them.

16
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,959
Really, nothing at all. Really.

17
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,359
Nothing.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,599
Hey, you guys. You guys.

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,480
Chandler's coming, and he says
he has this incredible news.

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,920
So when he gets here,
let's all act like, you know…

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,560
- Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,079
Never mind.
But it was gonna be really good.

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,920
- What's going on?
- What's up?

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,439
It's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers

25
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,359
and Big Al calls me
into his office

26
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,439
and tells me he wants to make me
processing supervisor.

27
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,680
- That is great!
- Congratulations.

28
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,800
So I quit.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,759
Why?

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
Why?
This was supposed to be a temp job.

31
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, Chandler,
you've been there for five years.

32
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,520
I know, but if I took
this promotion

33
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,240
it'd be like admitting
that this is what I actually do.

34
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,639
So was it a lot more money?

35
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,360
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be one of those guys

36
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,759
that's in his office until 12:00 at
night worrying about the WENUS.

37
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,039
"The WENUS"?

38
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,919
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,800
Oh, that WENUS.

40
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,240
So, what are you gonna do?

41
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,560
I don't know. That's the thing.
I don't know.

42
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,719
I'm not gonna figure it out
working there.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh! I have something you can do.

44
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,159
I have this new massage client.
Steve.

45
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,680
Anyway, um, he's opening up
a restaurant…

46
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,919
and he's looking for a head chef.

47
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,159
Hi there.

48
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,599
Hi.

49
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
Oh, yeah, I know. You're a chef,
I know, and I thought of you first.

50
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,039
But, um, Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so…

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah, I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

52
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,919
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Yeah. Yeah.

54
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,039
What kind of food is he looking for?

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,039
He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone

56
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
who can, you know,
create the entire menu.

57
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,159
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,680
So, what do you think?

59
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,520
Thanks, Pheeb. I just don't really
see myself in a big white hat.

60
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,599
Okay.

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,919
Oh, Monica. Guess what?

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

63
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,599
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

64
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,599
Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,639
Well, I have an appointment
to see Dr. Robert Pilman

66
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,199
career counselor-a-go-go.

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,800
I added the "a-go-go."

68
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,240
Career counselor?

69
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:14,319
Hey, you guys all know
what you want to do.

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,120
I don't.

71
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,839
Hey, you guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,000
You know, you have goals.
You have dreams.

73
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,639
I don't have a dream.

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,879
Ah, the lesser known
"I Don't Have a Dream" speech.

75
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,319
Oh, I love my life. I love my life.

76
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,079
Brian's Song.

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,240
The meeting with that guy went great?

78
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,120
So great. He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

79
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,319
It's this cute little place
on 10th Street.

80
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,199
It's not too big, not too small.
It's just right.

81
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,120
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm cooking dinner for him Monday
night. Kind of like an audition.

83
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,879
And Phoebe, he really wants you to
be here, which will be great for me.

84
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,160
Because you can make yummy noises.

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,519
- What are you gonna make?
- Yummy noises.

86
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,839
And, Monica, what are you gonna make?

87
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,439
I don't know. I don't know.
It's just gotta be so great.

88
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,800
I know what you can make. I know.

89
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,560
Oh, you should make that thing,
you know, with the stuff.

90
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,959
You know that thing with the stuff?

91
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,560
Okay, I don't know.

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,600
Hey, guys, anyone know a good
date place in the neighborhood?

93
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,360
How about Tony's? If you can
finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

94
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,959
Okay.

95
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,959
Does anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,519
- Who are you going out with?
- Oh, is this the bug lady?

97
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,040
I love you, Ross.

98
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,959
Her name is Celia.
She's not a bug lady.

99
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,279
She's curator of insects
at the museum.

100
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,480
So, what are you guys gonna do?

101
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,720
I just thought we'd go to dinner,
then bring her back to my place

102
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
and I'd introduce her to my monkey.

103
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,439
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

104
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,920
So back to your place?

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,800
You thinking maybe, heh-heh?

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,279
Well, I don't know, heh-heh.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,759
I'm hoping heh-heh.

108
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,160
I'm telling you,
that monkey's a chick magnet.

109
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,199
She's gonna one look at his furry,
cute little face

110
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,519
and it'll seal the deal.

111
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,079
Celia, don't worry.

112
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,399
Celia, he's not gonna hurt you.
Soothing tones, Celia.

113
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,319
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

114
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,160
- Here, here. Marcel? Marcel?
- I can't stand this.

115
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
- He's got his claws on my…
- Yeah, all right.

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,439
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

117
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,439
- Good.
- Yeah?

118
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,720
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

119
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,120
It's creamier.

120
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,319
Yeah? Well, is that better?

121
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,600
I don't know. We're talking
about whipped fish, Monica.

122
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,680
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down,
you know?

123
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,319
God, what happened to you?

124
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,279
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests,

125
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,560
intelligence tests, personality
tests, and what do I learn?

126
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,439
"You're ideally suited for a career
in data processing

127
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,720
for a large multi-national
corporation."

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,199
That's so great, because you
already know how to do that.

129
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,680
Can you believe it?

130
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,199
Don't I seem like somebody who should
be doing something really cool?

131
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,879
You know, I just always
pictured myself doing something…

132
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,639
Something.

133
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,600
Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

134
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,199
Oh, hey, you can see your nipples
through this shirt.

135
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,360
Here you go.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

136
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,040
You know,
I had a grape about five hours ago,

137
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,399
so I better split this with you.

138
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,480
It's supposed to be that small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

139
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,439
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

140
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,800
Well, it is amusing.

141
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,000
Hello? Oh, hi, Wendy.

142
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,759
Yeah, 8:00.

143
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,680
What did we say?
Ten dollars an hour?

144
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,399
Okay, great.

145
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,600
All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

146
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,279
Ten dollars an hour for what?

147
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,720
I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.

148
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,679
Waitressing?

149
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,679
Of course I thought of you.

150
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,200
But…

151
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
- But…
- But, but?

152
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,480
But, you see, it's just this night
has to go just perfect

153
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,519
and, well, Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

154
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,519
I see. Yes. And I've sort of been
maintaining my amateur status,

155
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,440
so that I can waitress
in the Olympics.

156
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,360
You know, I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

157
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,159
Amuse-bouche?

158
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
Talk to me.

159
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,559
Okay…

160
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,120
A weird thing happened to me
on the train this morning…

161
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,720
No, no, no. Talk dirty.

162
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,240
- Here?
- Come on.

163
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,799
Come on.

164
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,399
Say something…

165
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,919
…hot.

166
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,240
What?

167
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,639
What?

168
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
What?

169
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,519
What?

170
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,279
- What?
- Vulva.

171
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,200
"Vulva"?

172
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,600
All right, I panicked, all right?

173
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,440
She took me by surprise.

174
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,240
You know, but it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, uh, we ended up cuddling.

175
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,159
You cuddled?
How many times?

176
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,799
Shut up. It was nice. I just…

177
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,919
I just don't think I'm the
dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,559
What's the big deal?
Just say what you want to do to her.

179
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,679
Or what you want her to do to you.

180
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,600
Or what you think other people
might be doing to each other.

181
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,240
Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.

182
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
Please be kidding.

183
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,080
Why not? Come on.

184
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,639
Just close your eyes and tell me what
you'd like to be doing right now.

185
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,480
Okay, I'm…

186
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,039
I'm in my apartment…

187
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,639
Yeah, what else?

188
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,320
That's it. You're not there.
We're not having this conversation.

189
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,960
- All right. Look, I'll start, okay?
- Joey, please.

190
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,279
Come on, come on.
All right, ready? Look.

191
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,320
Oh, Ross.

192
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,120
You get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.

193
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,200
See?

194
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,399
- All right, now you say something.
- I… I really don't think so.

195
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,879
Come on.

196
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,440
- You like this woman, right?
- Yeah.

197
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,080
- You wanna see her again, right?
- Sure.

198
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,240
Well, if you can't talk dirty to me,
how are you gonna talk dirty to her?

199
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,519
Now tell me you want to caress
my butt.

200
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,360
Okay, turn around.

201
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,720
I just don't want you staring at me
when I'm doing this.

202
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:54,559
All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.

203
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,840
Okay.

204
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
I want, um…

205
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,279
Okay, I want…

206
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,639
to feel…

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,559
.. your hot, soft skin with my lips.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,639
There you go.

209
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,159
Keep going, keep going.

210
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,080
I…

211
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,240
I want to take my tongue and…

212
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,039
And…

213
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,759
Say it.

214
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,159
Say it!

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,240
Run it all over your body

216
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,799
until you're trembling with…

217
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,080
With?

218
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,240
- Funny story.
- You're not gonna believe this.

219
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,759
It's okay. It's okay.

220
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,000
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

221
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,840
Hey, while you were sleeping, that
guy from your old job called again.

222
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh. Again?

223
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,480
- And again and again and again.
- And again.

224
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:24,720
Hello? Heh. And again.

225
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,679
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 15th floor?

226
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,600
Yeah, I miss you too.

227
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,559
Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying
to steal pens from your own home.

228
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
Well, that's very generous.

229
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,279
Uh, but look,
this isn't about the money.

230
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,399
You know? I need something
that's more than a job.

231
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,000
I need something
I really care about…

232
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,240
That's on top of the year-end bonus
structure you mentioned earlier?

233
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,679
Your dream.

234
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,000
Look, Al. Al, I'm not playing
hardball here, okay?

235
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,240
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection.

236
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,159
No… No, no. No, no.

237
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,840
No, stop saying numbers!

238
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,399
I'm telling you, you've got the
wrong guy! You got the wrong guy!

239
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,840
I'll see you Monday!

240
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,480
It's huge.

241
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,759
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

242
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,080
This is a cube.

243
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,679
Look at this.

244
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,320
You have a window!

245
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,559
Yes, indeedy.

246
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,720
- With a beautiful view of…
- Oh, look. That guy's peeing.

247
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,120
Okay. That's enough of the view.
All right, check this out.

248
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,919
- Okay, sit down here. Sit down.
- Okay.

249
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,120
Okay, this is great. This is great.

250
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,320
- You ready?
- Yeah.

251
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,120
Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?

252
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,799
Thank you, Helen, that'll be all.

253
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,120
Last time I do that. I promise.

254
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,360
Wendy, we had a deal.

255
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,559
Yeah, you promised.

256
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,080
Wendy. Wendy. Wendy!

257
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,759
Who was that?

258
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,559
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.

259
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,840
That's too bad.

260
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,080
Bye-bye.

261
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,559
- Ten dollars an hour.
- Nope.

262
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Twelve dollars an hour.

263
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,639
Mon, I wish I could,
but I've made plans to walk around.

264
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,080
Rachel, when you ran out
on your wedding, I was there for you.

265
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,840
I put a roof over your head,
and if that means nothing to you…

266
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,360
Twenty dollars an hour.

267
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,879
Done.

268
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,200
- Well, hello. Welcome to Monica's.
- Hello.

269
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,759
May I take your coat?

270
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
- Hi, Steve.
- Hello, Monica.

271
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,480
Hello, greeter girl.

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,440
- This is Rachel.
- Yeah, okay.

273
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,600
Everything smells so delicious.

274
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,919
I can't remember a time I smelled
such a delicious combination of…

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,399
Okay, smells.

276
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,240
Well, it's a lovely apartment.

277
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,919
Oh, thank you.
Would you like a tour?

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,639
I was just being polite,
but all right.

279
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,879
What? What's up?

280
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,919
In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.

281
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,720
What?

282
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,360
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.

283
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,639
Okay, okay, okay.

284
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,840
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech. Okay.

285
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,120
Is it dry in here?

286
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,360
Let me get you some wine.

287
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,920
Yeah, I think we're ready
for our first course too.

288
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:06,839
Okay…

289
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,480
These are rock shrimp ravioli
in a cilantro ponzu sauce,

290
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,759
with just a touch of minced…

291
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,000
…ginger.

292
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,119
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy.

293
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,400
These are fantastic.

294
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,079
Oh, gosh.
I'm so glad you liked them.

295
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,279
Like them?
I could eat a hundred of them.

296
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,440
Well, um…

297
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,119
That's all there is of these, but
in about eight and a half minutes,

298
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,400
we'll be serving
some delicious onion tartlets.

299
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,160
"Tartlets"?

300
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,279
"Tartlets."

301
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,000
Word has lost all meaning.

302
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,079
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?

303
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,400
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

304
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,720
Oh, cool. Taco shells.

305
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,759
You know, these are… They are like
a little corn envelope, you know?

306
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,440
You know what? You don't want
to spoil your appetite.

307
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,839
Hey. Sugar-O's.

308
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,519
You know, if you just wait
another six and a half minutes…

309
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,279
Macaroni and cheese.
We gotta make this.

310
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,960
No, we don't.

311
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,160
Oh, okay.

312
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,400
Oh, sorry.

313
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,599
Yeah, why don't you
just have a seat here?

314
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,599
Okay.

315
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,519
Okay.
Give me the Gummy Bears.

316
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,720
Yeah, I… No.

317
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,000
- Give them to me.
- All right, we'll share.

318
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,559
- No. Give me the bears.
- Well, then you can't have any.

319
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,200
- Give them to me.
- This is not worth it.

320
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,599
Bears overboard.
They're drowning.

321
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,160
Hey, fellas. Grab onto a Sugar-O.
Save yourselves.

322
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,160
Help! Help!
I'm drowning. Help! Help!

323
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,880
That's it, okay? Dinner is over.

324
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,160
- What?
- "What"?

325
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,680
- Why?
- "Why"?

326
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,160
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this

327
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,279
and you can't even wait
four and a half minutes

328
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,119
for a stupid onion tartlet?

329
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,200
What a tool.

330
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,599
You don't want to work
for a guy like that.

331
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,279
I know. It's just…

332
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,720
I don't know, I just thought
that this was, you know, "it."

333
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,759
Look, you'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

334
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:01,440
You know all those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.

335
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,680
So, uh, how did it go with Celia?

336
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,160
I was unbelievable.

337
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,200
All right, Ross.

338
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,279
I was the James Michener
of dirty talk.

339
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:22,839
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

340
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,359
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines…

341
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,079
Themes, a motif.

342
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,720
At one point, there were villagers.

343
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, and…

344
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,440
Well, you know, by the time
we finished with all the dirty talk,

345
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,079
it was kind of late
and we were both exhausted, so…

346
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,599
- You cuddled.
- Yeah, which was nice.

347
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,640
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie or something?

348
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,839
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait
for Chandler?

349
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Where the hell is he?

350
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,839
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is,

351
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,839
but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy.

352
00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh, really?
Well, let me tell you something.

353
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,640
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

354
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,559
How's this?

355
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,839
Sorry. How about over here?

356
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,880
See, now,
that just means it's working.

357
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,119
- Does this hurt?
- No.

358
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,680
How about this?

359
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,839
There you go.

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,079
I'm gonna throw up.
