1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,572
I'm telling you, Ross, she wants you.

2
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:08,575
She barely knows me.
We just live in the same building.

3
00:00:08,827 --> 00:00:11,161
- Any contact?
- She lent me an egg once.

4
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:12,579
You're in.

5
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,207
Oh, right.

6
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,709
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey.

7
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:26,009
Come on, Ross. You gotta get back
in the game here.

8
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:30,389
The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you...

9
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,225
I don't think we need a third.

10
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:36,687
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
over here, still in the shell?

11
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:37,938
An egg?

12
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:43,068
Yeah. Go up to her and say, "Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg. "

13
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:45,279
I think it's winning.

14
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:48,365
- I think it's insane.
- She'll love it.

15
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:52,536
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Here.

16
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:57,624
Go with the egg, my friend.

17
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:02,421
Go, go, go.

18
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:07,676
- Think it'll work?
- It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

19
00:01:58,144 --> 00:02:00,229
- You cannot do this.
- What? Do what?

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,022
Roger wants to take her out.

21
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:05,275
No. Pheebs. Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

22
00:02:05,944 --> 00:02:07,444
Because he was creepy.

23
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:10,364
And mean. And a little frightening.

24
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:13,158
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day.

25
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:15,369
- Hi.
- Hi.

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,247
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

27
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:20,207
I know I do.

28
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:22,709
- Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:25,379
What are you doing tomorrow night?

30
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,923
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

31
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:32,302
- Oh. Uh, listen, about tonight...
- No, no, don't you dare bail on me.

32
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:36,014
She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

33
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,100
But her friend sounds like such a...

34
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:40,560
Pathetic mess. I know, but...

35
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:44,356
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable. I'm thinking:

36
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:51,363
Thanks.

37
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:56,118
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

38
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:58,245
- Hi.
- Hi.

39
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:00,414
- She said yes.
- Ahem.

40
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:01,999
Yes! Way to go, man.

41
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,253
- Still got the egg, huh?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,019
- How do I look?
- Oh, um...

43
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,562
I don't care.

44
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,692
There's Lorraine.

45
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,694
Now, remember, no trading.

46
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,238
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

47
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,991
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

48
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,786
Well, well.

49
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,621
Look what you brought.

50
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,332
Very nice.

51
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,335
And what did you bring?

52
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:49,755
She's checking her coat.

53
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:53,300
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

54
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:57,346
Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

55
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,521
Janice?

56
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:09,066
Oh...

57
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:10,525
my...

58
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:11,985
God.

59
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,283
Hey, it's Janice.

60
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,875
Okay, I'm making a break for it.
I'm going out the window.

61
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:31,755
No, don't, please. I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine.

62
00:04:31,964 --> 00:04:34,174
- Just calm down.
- Calm down? Calm down?

63
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:37,219
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months.

64
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:38,804
Hey.

65
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:43,266
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous...

66
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,855
and I can't go when I'm nervous.

67
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,566
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

68
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:58,657
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

69
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:04,079
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

70
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,206
- Which one was he?
- Pete the Weeper?

71
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:10,127
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

72
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:13,130
"Oh, was it good for you?"

73
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:19,511
Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the "I win" guy.

74
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,805
"I win. I win. "

75
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:26,601
I went out with him for two months.
I didn't get to win once.

76
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:30,605
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

77
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:33,692
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

78
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:37,446
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

79
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,325
There's more beer, right?

80
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:47,581
Oh. You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

81
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,877
She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle...

82
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:54,421
you can do a cleansing ritual.

83
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:00,760
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

84
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,638
Yeah.

85
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:06,850
So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

86
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,935
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

87
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:11,563
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

88
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:15,859
Okay, we can, um, burn the stuff
they gave us.

89
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,403
Or?

90
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:23,450
Or we can chant and dance around naked,
you know, with sticks.

91
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:27,787
- Burning's good.
- Burning's good.

92
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,581
I've got stuff to burn.

93
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,674
You know...

94
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:44,304
ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

95
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:47,182
Yeah? Good for you.

96
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:53,230
Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?

97
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:02,531
By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

98
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:06,243
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

99
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,287
That's okay.

100
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:13,708
Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

101
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,462
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty.

102
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,716
We can't do that.

103
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,970
What? What can't you do?

104
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:30,433
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

105
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,693
Uh, we might be leaving now.

106
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,487
Tell me it's you and me "we. "

107
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,993
She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

108
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,912
I'm not even sure what slathering is.

109
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:54,040
But I definitely want to be
a part of it.

110
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,128
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

111
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:01,840
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

112
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:06,344
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

113
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,513
I'm out of here.

114
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:13,643
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.

115
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,479
I hope she throws up on you.

116
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:19,983
Thanks.

117
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:25,071
- So...
- Just us.

118
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:27,741
Ugh, what a crappy night.

119
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:32,203
Although I have enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out...

120
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:35,332
of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

121
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,588
Excuse me.

122
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,384
How you doing?

123
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:55,226
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

124
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:57,812
Joey's not a friend. He's...

125
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:03,068
a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

126
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,198
Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

127
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:10,033
I will go for that drink.

128
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,826
You got it. Good woman.

129
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,751
A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

130
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,628
- Each.
- That's right. Each.

131
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,797
Oh. And a, uh, Rob Roy.

132
00:09:24,924 --> 00:09:26,633
I've always wanted to know.

133
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,613
Happy Valentine's Day.

134
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,998
Oh, I miss you already.

135
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:02,085
Can you believe this happened?

136
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,795
No, no.

137
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,715
And yet it did.

138
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,884
- Goodbye, Janice.
- Kiss me.

139
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:17,642
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

140
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,980
- Hey, Janice.
- Hi, Monica.

141
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,108
Okay. Well, this was very special.

142
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:29,237
Rach, come see who's out here.

143
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:32,615
What's going on...?
Oh, my God.

144
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:34,993
Janice. Hi.

145
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:38,163
Janice is gonna go away now.

146
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:41,166
I'll be right back.

147
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:45,378
Oh. Joey. Look who it is.

148
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:47,213
Whoa.

149
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,092
Oh, good. Joey's home now.

150
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:53,678
This is so much fun.

151
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:56,264
This is like a reunion in the hall.

152
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,145
Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

153
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:05,857
He just happened to call.

154
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:09,527
Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right.
It's me. How did you know?

155
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:20,413
I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then...

156
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:24,959
because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing...

157
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:28,505
that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles...

158
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:32,884
he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half.

159
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,890
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

160
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:51,820
What?

161
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:56,366
Who are they?

162
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,868
The, uh, blond is my ex-wife.

163
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,163
And the woman touching her is her...

164
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:04,582
close personal friend.

165
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,878
You mean they're lovers?

166
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,214
If you want to put a label on it.

167
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,509
Wow. Heh.

168
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,595
- Anything else I should know?
- Nope. That's it.

169
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,474
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

170
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:27,522
I always forget that part.

171
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:30,733
Hello.

172
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:42,203
Okay. So now we need, um,
sage branches and the sacramental wine.

173
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,583
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

174
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:48,626
Um, that's okay.

175
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,089
- Ooh.
- Okay.

176
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:57,051
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

177
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,893
Huh. Okay, Pheebs, if we had that...

178
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,270
we wouldn't be doing the ritual
in the first place.

179
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:12,442
- Can we start throwing things in?
- Um, yeah, okay.

180
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,320
Oh. Okay. Um...

181
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,697
Okay. Barry's letters.

182
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:21,743
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

183
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:24,245
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with:

184
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:33,463
- A picture of Scotty Jared, naked.
- Let me see.

185
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,298
He's wearing a sweater.

186
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:37,508
- No.
- Ew!

187
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:45,016
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

188
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:46,768
Wait. Isn't it almost pure...?

189
00:13:52,066 --> 00:13:54,817
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

190
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:58,029
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

191
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,077
Oh, man. In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

192
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:08,414
Hello, funny valentine.

193
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,167
Hi, just Janice.

194
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:14,629
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

195
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,715
I could just kiss you all over,
and I'm gonna.

196
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:22,011
Oh. Okay, heh. Ha, ha, okay.

197
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,431
If you don't do it, I will.

198
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,489
So, um, what do you do for a living?

199
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,032
Well, um for the past few years...

200
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:47,286
Oh, no. You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

201
00:14:47,496 --> 00:14:48,538
I thought they could.

202
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:52,041
- Working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

203
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,503
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

204
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:59,048
So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science, heh...

205
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,052
which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

206
00:15:15,274 --> 00:15:17,066
Now, that is funny.

207
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,612
Hey, do you think...?

208
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:25,825
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

209
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:28,161
Because she's alone now.

210
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:30,496
And pregnant. And sad.

211
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:33,124
- I guess.
- Are you sure?

212
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,792
Thanks. Carol.

213
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:37,295
Wanna come over and join us?

214
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:38,755
Oh, no. I'm fine.

215
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:42,091
Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down. Come on.

216
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:45,511
Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

217
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:48,765
Let's try scooching. Come on.

218
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,100
- Come on.
- Thank you.

219
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:56,314
Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

220
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:59,025
- Carol, Kristen.
- How do you do?

221
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,527
Um... Oh, uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.

222
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,280
And, uh, Kristen...

223
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,952
Kristen does something...

224
00:16:11,497 --> 00:16:13,206
that, funnily enough...

225
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,501
wasn't even her major.

226
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,298
What do we got there?

227
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,551
A piece of silk boxer shorts...

228
00:16:26,178 --> 00:16:27,804
some greeting cards...

229
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:31,474
what looks like a
half-charred picture of...

230
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:34,644
Wow, that guy's hairier
than the chief.

231
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:41,609
You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

232
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,611
It's all right. Don't explain.

233
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:46,948
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of control.

234
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,953
- You're our third call tonight.
- Really?

235
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:55,289
Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

236
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:00,336
I brought you something.

237
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:02,046
Is it loaded?

238
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:08,344
Oh, little candy hearts.

239
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,390
"Chan and Jan forever. "

240
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:14,934
I had them made special.

241
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,981
Okay, Janice.

242
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:22,108
Janice.

243
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:24,861
Hey, Janice.

244
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,324
Look, there's no way for me
to tell you this.

245
00:17:30,576 --> 00:17:33,119
At least, there's no new way
for me to tell you this.

246
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:39,041
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

247
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:42,962
That's fine.

248
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,467
- It is?
- Mm-hm.

249
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:52,305
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

250
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:56,851
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

251
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:59,937
No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

252
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:01,647
Don't you know it yet?

253
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:05,067
You love me, Chandler Bing.

254
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:10,865
Oh, no, I don't.

255
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:14,368
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

256
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,454
New Year's, who invited who?

257
00:18:16,705 --> 00:18:19,582
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

258
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,251
- I did, but...
- You seek me out.

259
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:27,632
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn.

260
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:31,761
Janice. Janice.

261
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:34,347
You want me. You need me.

262
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,808
You can't live without me.

263
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:39,685
And you know it.

264
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:43,940
You just don't know you know it.

265
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,445
See you.

266
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:57,620
Call me.

267
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:10,216
It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

268
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,969
You did so. I swear.
I swear to...

269
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,267
How long has she been in the bathroom?

270
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:23,354
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

271
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:25,690
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

272
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,279
Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

273
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,031
- That could be it.
- Oh, God.

274
00:19:35,325 --> 00:19:37,743
You know, this is still pretty hot.

275
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:43,582
Mushroom.

276
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,127
Smile.

277
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,090
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

278
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,593
- I'm sorry. That's not funny.
- No, it's just...

279
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:58,848
Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

280
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,142
Well, do I have to?

281
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:06,439
I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

282
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,733
and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

283
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,860
But there's...

284
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:13,279
That's it.

285
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:19,243
And, uh, then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

286
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:21,954
And I don't have to...

287
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,956
- I know.
- You know?

288
00:20:28,086 --> 00:20:31,255
Here's a wacky thought. Um, ahem.

289
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:35,217
- Let's say you and I give it another shot.
- Ross.

290
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:37,678
No, no, I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

291
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,685
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

292
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:47,438
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

293
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:50,566
Because we're great together,
you know?

294
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,860
You can't deny it.

295
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:56,280
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

296
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:59,283
- I mean, how perfect is that?
- Ross...

297
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:02,453
You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

298
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:03,662
I love you.

299
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:13,714
I love you too.

300
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,051
- But...
- No "but. " No "but. "

301
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:22,223
You know that thing
we put over here with the pin in it?

302
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:27,728
It's time to take the pin out.

303
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:33,567
Yeah.

304
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:38,114
You'll find someone. I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

305
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:41,200
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

306
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:46,580
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

307
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:52,044
Not her.

308
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,599
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

309
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,476
- Okay.
- Great.

310
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:10,813
So, um, will you bring the truck?

311
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:15,818
- I'll even let you ring the bell.
- Wohoo!

312
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,946
- We'll see you later.
- Bye. See you later.

313
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:20,865
Thanks. See you.

314
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:22,366
Oh, my God.

315
00:22:23,493 --> 00:22:25,202
See, there you go.

316
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:27,830
- The cleansing worked.
- You're right.

317
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:29,540
They're nice guys.

318
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,168
They're firemen guys.

319
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:36,130
- You tell them you're married?
- No way.

320
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:38,549
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them.

321
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:44,388
