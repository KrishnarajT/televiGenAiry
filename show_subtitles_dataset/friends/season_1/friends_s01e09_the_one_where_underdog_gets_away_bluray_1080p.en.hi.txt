Mm. You guys have to make a wish.

338
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:02,046
- Make a wish?
- Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

339
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:09,553
Ooh. You got the bigger half.
What did you wish for?

340
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:11,722
The bigger half.

341
00:21:13,683 --> 00:21:16,268
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.

342
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:18,896
- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
ALL: Mm.

343
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:22,024
This isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...

344
00:21:22,192 --> 00:21:25,986
but for me this has been really great,
you know?

345
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:28,906
I think because it didn't involve divorce...

346
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:30,908
or projectile vomiting.

347
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,913
I was just thinking,
if you'd gone to Vail...

348
00:21:36,081 --> 00:21:40,000
or if you guys had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...

349
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,710
syphilis and stuff...

350
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,257
we wouldn't be all together, you know?

351
00:21:46,425 --> 00:21:48,092
So I guess what I'm trying to say...

352
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:54,140
is that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

353
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,600
RACHEL & JOEY:
That's so sweet.

354
00:21:56,768 --> 00:21:58,769
RACHEL:
Thank you.

355
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:00,438
ROSS:
Mm.

356
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:02,731
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

357
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:04,191
And a crappy New Year.

358
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,652
ALL:
Hear, hear.
