1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,080
Okay, okay, I checked.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,919
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast,
cinnamon stick,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,759
chamomile, mint medley,
blackberry and, uh…

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,240
Oh, wait, there's one more…
Lemon soother.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,199
You're not the guy that asked
for the tea, are you?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,960
Okay.

7
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,799
Mail call.
Rachel Green, bunk seven.

8
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,519
Thank you.

9
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,439
Oh, cool. A free sample of coffee.

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh, good, because where else
would we get any? Ha, ha.

11
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,200
Oh, right.

12
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,079
- Oh, great.
- What is it?

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,879
Country club newsletter.

14
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:36,439
My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, my God.

16
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh, my God. It's Barry and Mindy.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,239
- Barry, who you almost…
- Barry, who I almost…

18
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,879
- Mindy, your maid of…
- My maid of…

19
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,519
Let me see. That's Mindy?

20
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,760
Wow, she is pretty.

21
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,280
Lucky…

22
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,120
…to have had a friend like you.

23
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,400
Marcel, bring me the rice.
Come on.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,439
Good boy.
Come here, give me the rice.

25
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,920
Thank you. Good boy.

26
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,280
I see he's mastered the difference
between "bring me the"…

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,080
and "pee in the."

28
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,400
"Bring me the" and… Rach?

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,439
- What?
- Hi.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,919
Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,719
This is so stupid.

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,080
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

33
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,080
I should be happy for them.

34
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,439
I am. I'm happy for them.

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,919
- Really?
- No.

36
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,680
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

37
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,960
What…

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,639
What happened to
"Forget relationships.

39
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,199
I'm done with men"?
The whole, uh, penis embargo?

40
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,879
I don't know.

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,000
I guess it's not about no guys.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,360
It's about the right guy, you know?

43
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,759
With Barry, it was safe and it
was easy, but there was no heat.

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,120
You know, with Paolo
that's all there was, was heat.

45
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,400
And I mean, it was just this raw,
animal, sexual…

46
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,599
Right, right. I got it.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,680
I was there.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
I mean, do you think
you can ever have both?

49
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,840
You know?
Someone who's like your best friend,

50
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,280
but then also can make
your toes curl.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,919
Yes, yes.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,719
Yes. Yes, I do. I really do.

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
In fact, it's funny.

54
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,439
Very often, someone who
you wouldn't think could…

55
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,039
Curl your toes…

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,319
…might just be the one who…

57
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,080
- Hi.
- Gets interrupted. Hi.

58
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,039
Hey, guys, how was the movie?

59
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,759
- So wonderful!
- It was so good!

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
- Suck fest.
- Total chick flick.

61
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm sorry it wasn't
one of those movies

62
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,159
with, like, you know, like,
guns and bombs

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,360
and, like, buses going really fast.

64
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,560
Hey, I don't need violence
to enjoy a movie,

65
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,240
just so long
as there's a little nudity.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,520
- There was nudity.
- I meant female nudity.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,280
All right, I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,039
Hugh. Hugh Grant.

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,039
All right, I've got to go.

70
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,719
Come on, Marcel. Come on.

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,399
Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

72
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,279
They're still just friends, right?

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,399
- And I will see you tomorrow.
- That's right.

74
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,199
You're gonna spend tomorrow
at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you?

75
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,959
Hang on, hang on.
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,079
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

77
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,000
Unclench.
You're not even gonna be here.

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,199
I can't believe
we're having this discussion.

79
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,240
I agree.
I'm, like, in disbelief.

80
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,879
Don't you think if things
were gonna happen with Rachel,

81
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,199
they would've happened?

82
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,839
I'm telling you, she said
she's looking for a relationship

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
with someone exactly like me.

84
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,519
She really said that?

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,639
Well, I added
the "exactly like me" part.

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,560
But she said she's looking
for someone.

87
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,040
And someone
is gonna be there tonight.

88
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,480
"Tonight" tonight?

89
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,720
Well, I think it's perfect.
It's just gonna be the two of us.

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,959
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

91
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,319
I can't remember the last time

92
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,560
I got a girl
to take care of my monkey.

93
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,920
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd go pick up a bottle of wine,

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,319
go over there and
try to woo her.

95
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,439
Hey, you know what you should do?

96
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,839
You should take her back to the 1890s
when that phrase was last used.

97
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,920
If you keep this up, honey, I swear

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,560
<i>you'll be finished with this sucker
by the end of the week.</i>

99
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,800
Now, the one in the feathered boa,
that's Dr. Francis.

100
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,279
Now, she used to be a man.

101
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,920
Oh, look. See, now, there's Raven.
We hate her.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
We're glad she's dying.

103
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,439
And then… What? Marcel.

104
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,720
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You know you're not supposed to…

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,839
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,000
Marcel. Bad monkey.

107
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,120
Oh, God.

108
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,120
Sorry, Barry.

109
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,199
A little engagement gift.

110
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,959
I'm sure you didn't register
for that.

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,160
Who died? Who died?

112
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,279
Roll him over.
Oh, come on, roll him over.

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,680
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because…

114
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,519
Marcel? Marcel?

115
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,800
- How could you lose him?
- I don't know.

116
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,480
We were watching TV, and then
he pooped in Monica's shoe…

117
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,279
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

118
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,240
I don't know. The left one.

119
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,319
Which ones?

120
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,439
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

121
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,279
- Hey.
- Hey.

122
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,759
Why is the air in here so negative?

123
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,120
- Rachel lost Marcel.
- No. How?

124
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,360
- He pooped in my shoe.
- Which one?

125
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,720
Those cute little black ones
I wear all the time.

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,639
No, which one?

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,839
The right or left?

128
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Because the left one is lucky.

129
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,680
Come on, you guys.
What am I gonna do?

130
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,639
All right, all right, all right.
You're a monkey,

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,360
you're loose in the city.

132
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:37,240
Where do you go?

133
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,279
Okay, it's his first time out,

134
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,360
so he's probably gonna want
to do some of the touristy things.

135
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,040
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

136
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Oh, my God! Come on, you guys.

137
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,920
He's gonna be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,439
Start with the building.
You take the first and second floor.

139
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,079
Phoebe and I will take third
and fourth.

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
What am I gonna do?

141
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,319
You stay here
and just wait by the phone.

142
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,639
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
Does anybody want to trade?

144
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,879
What do you want?

145
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,160
Mr. Heckles, our friend lost
a monkey. Have you seen it?

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,040
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

147
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,240
No.

148
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,759
Why would you leave
your Belgian waffle in the hall?

149
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,519
I wasn't ready for it.

150
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,279
The monkey,
have you seen a monkey?

151
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
I saw Regis Philbin once.

152
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,840
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

153
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,960
You owe me a waffle.

154
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay, he's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face

155
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,159
with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

156
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
Okay, thanks.

157
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
- Hi.
- Hey. How did it go today?

158
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,120
- Great. It went great. Really great.
- Yeah.

159
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,279
- Hey, is that wine?
- Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,879
You, uh, want some?

161
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,759
- I would love some.
- Yeah.

162
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,320
But you know what?
Let's not drink it here.

163
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,759
I'm feeling kind of crazy.
Do you want to go to Newark?

164
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
Uh, okay. Yeah.
We could do that.

165
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
But before we head off to the
murder capital of the Northeast,

166
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,440
I was, uh, kind of wanted
to run something by you.

167
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,720
You know how we were,
you know, talking before

168
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,080
about relationships and stuff,
well…

169
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,919
- G od, Ross, I cannot do this.
- Okay, quick and painful.

170
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,960
Oh, God.

171
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,720
Okay, all right. All right, okay.

172
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,679
Ross, please don't hate me.

173
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Oh, what? What? What?

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,720
You know Marcel?

175
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,960
- Yeah?
- Well…

176
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:57,440
I kind of… I kind of lost him.

177
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,639
I can't believe this.

178
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,240
I mean, all I asked you to do
was keep him in the apartment.

179
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,559
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

180
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,759
You know what?
I guess it's partially my fault.

181
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,159
I shouldn't have asked you
to start off with a monkey.

182
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,039
I should have started you off with,
like, a pen or a pencil.

183
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,720
Ross,
I'm doing everything that I can.

184
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,600
I've got everybody looking
for him and I got…

185
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,759
- Who is it?
- Animal Control.

186
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,120
- See, I've even got Animal Control.
- You called Animal Control?

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,320
Why? Do you not like them?

188
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,039
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

189
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,679
I'm not allowed
to have him in the city.

190
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,960
If they find him,
they'll take him away from me.

191
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,919
Okay, well, now, see,
you never ever, ever told us that.

192
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,000
Because I didn't expect you we're
gonna invite them to the apartment.

193
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,679
Hi. Thanks for coming.

194
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,039
Somebody called about a monkey?

195
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,399
You know what?
That was a complete misunderstanding.

196
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,879
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

197
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,399
- It turned out it was a hat.
- Cat.

198
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,240
Cat. What did I say?

199
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,159
Hi. We checked
the third and fourth floor.

200
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,799
- No one's seen Marcel.
- Marcel?

201
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,080
My uncle Marcel.

202
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,679
Oh, is that who the monkey's
named after?

203
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay.

204
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,279
Are you aware that possession
of an illegal exotic is punishable

205
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,679
by up to two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

206
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,240
Oh, my God.

207
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,600
You'd put that poor little creature
in jail?

208
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,960
Pheebs, you remember
how we talked about

209
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,360
saying things quietly
to yourself first?

210
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,519
Yes, but there isn't always time.

211
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,279
Look, I'm sure there's some friendly
way to reconcile this.

212
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,639
Have a seat.

213
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,799
First of all, we haven't been
introduced. I'm Monica Geller.

214
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,919
Oh, my God, you are.

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,240
- And you're Rachel Green.
- Yeah.

216
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,559
Luisa Gianetti. Lincoln High?

217
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,720
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

218
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,919
Luisa. Oh, my God.

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,039
Monica. It's Luisa!

220
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
Luisa. From homeroom.

221
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,759
Yes!

222
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,759
You have no idea who
I am, do you?

223
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,039
- No.
- Not at all.

224
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

225
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,799
Would it have been so hard to say,
"Morning, Luisa".

226
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,720
Or "Nice overalls"?

227
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,720
I'm so sorry.

228
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,399
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

229
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,840
But you. What a bitch.

230
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,000
What?

231
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,480
You know what? Be that as it may.

232
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,519
You think you could you help us
out here on that monkey thing,

233
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
for old times' sake?

234
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,559
Go, Bobcats.

235
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,399
I could.

236
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
But I won't.

237
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,279
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

238
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,759
Sorry.

239
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,000
Marcel?

240
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,440
Marcel?

241
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,399
- Marcel?
- Marcel?

242
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,840
Hi, can I help you?

243
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,840
We're kind of having
an emergency, and…

244
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,080
we were looking for something.

245
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,759
- A monkey.
- Yes, have you seen any?

246
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,519
No. No, I haven't seen a monkey.

247
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,159
Do you know anything
about fixing radiators?

248
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:00,639
Sure, sure. Did you try turning
the knob back the other way?

249
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,279
- Of course.
- Then, no.

250
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,120
Taste this daiquiri.
Is there too much rum in here?

251
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,799
Just a second.
Hope you find your monkey.

252
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,720
Oh, no, wait.
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

253
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,399
We may not know
about radiators, per se,

254
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
but we do have a certain amount
of expertise

255
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,879
in the heating and cooling milieu.

256
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,840
Weren't we kind of in the middle
of something here?

257
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:32,120
Yes, but these women are very hot
and they need our help.

258
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,159
And they're very hot.

259
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,120
We can't, all right?

260
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,720
We're sorry.

261
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,879
You have no idea how sorry. But
we promised we'd find this monkey.

262
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,159
If you see him, he's about yea high
and answers to the name Marcel.

263
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,559
So if we could get some pictures of
you, you'd really be helping us out.

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,919
Okay, from now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

265
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,559
- Marcel?
- Marcel.

266
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,240
Marcel?

267
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,919
Marcel?

268
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,759
- Oh, my God.
- What?

269
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,799
Something just brushed up
against my right leg.

270
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,399
What is it?

271
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,960
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.

272
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,360
Look, Phoebe.

273
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,120
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Marcel. Come here.

274
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
- Come here, Marcel.
- Step aside, ladies.

275
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,759
- What are you gonna do?
- Just a small tranquilizer.

276
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,399
Run, Marcel, run!
Run, Marcel!

277
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,360
- Damn.
- Are you okay?

278
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,720
Yeah, I think so.

279
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Oh, gosh.

280
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,679
Marcel. Marcel.

281
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,879
This is ridiculous.
We've been all over the neighborhood.

282
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,559
He's gone. He's just gone.

283
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,759
- Ross, you don't know that.
- Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark.

284
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,159
He doesn't know the Village.

285
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,559
And now I have a broken foot.
Oh, my…

286
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,080
I have no monkey and a broken foot.

287
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,399
Thank you very much.

288
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Ross, you know, I've said I'm sorry,
like, a million times.

289
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:34,919
What do you want me to do?
You want me to break my foot too?

290
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Here, I'm gonna break my foot
right now.

291
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,399
Oh, my God.
There, are you happy now?

292
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,840
Yeah, yeah. You know,
now that you kicked the sign…

293
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,159
I don't miss Marcel anymore.

294
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,759
You know, it's not like
I did this on purpose.

295
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,200
No. This is just vintage Rachel.

296
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,840
I mean, things just sort of happen
around you.

297
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,240
I mean, you're off in Rachel Land,
doing your Rachel thing,

298
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,119
totally oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and…

299
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,400
- I don't even want to hear it.
- Ross.

300
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,920
- Forget it, okay?
- Ross.

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,599
What? What?

302
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,480
Hey, banana man.

303
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,240
This is so intense.

304
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,920
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

305
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,599
Hi. Did you order some bananas?

306
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,079
- What about it?
- Give me my monkey back.

307
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I don't have a monkey.

308
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,079
- Then what's with all the bananas?
- Potassium.

309
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,359
Marcel? Marcel.

310
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,400
Okay, where is he? Where is he?
Marcel? Marcel?

311
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,240
Marcel.

312
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,880
What have you done to him?

313
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,319
That's my monkey. That's Patty.
Patty the monkey.

314
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,880
Are you insane?

315
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,160
- Come here, Marcel. Come on.
- Come here, Patty.

316
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,920
Come here, Marcel.

317
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,519
Come here, Patty.

318
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,400
Here, monkey. Here, monkey.
Here, monkey.

319
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,200
Gotcha.

320
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,680
- Okay, give me my monkey back.
- That's my monkey.

321
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,839
You're gonna have to take this up
with the judge.

322
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,160
That's not my monkey.
Just the dress is mine.

323
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,039
You can send it back whenever.

324
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,400
- All right, I want my monkey.
- No.

325
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,480
- Come on, Luisa.
- Sorry, prom queen.

326
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,599
You had to be a bitch in high school,
you couldn't have been fat.

327
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,559
All right, look, in high school,
I was the prom queen

328
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,960
and I was the homecoming queen
and the class president and you…

329
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,799
…were also there.

330
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,559
Look, if you take this monkey

331
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,680
I will lose one of the most
important people in my life.

332
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,880
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

333
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,160
Come on, Luisa, you have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

334
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,720
Take it.

335
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,599
No.

336
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,000
All right.

337
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,759
Well, then how about I call
your supervisor and I tell her

338
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,519
that you shot my friend
in the ass with a dart.

339
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,480
Hey, it'll be nice to get this off
finally, won't it?

340
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,519
Or we can leave it on for now.
That's fine.

341
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,200
You know,
with the right pair of pumps,

342
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,359
that would be a great little outfit.

343
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,480
Listen…

344
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,640
I'm sorry I was so hard
on you before. You know, I just…

345
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,839
No, Ross. No, no. It was my fault.
I almost lost your…

346
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,960
No. Yeah, but you were the one
who got him back.

347
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,400
You know, you were great.

348
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,279
Hey, we still have that bottle
of wine.

349
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,759
Are you in the mood for…

350
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,200
…something grape?

351
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,880
- Sure, that would be good.
- All right.

352
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

353
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,319
Well, ah, as long as we're here…

354
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:20,759
and not on the subject…

355
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,319
I was thinking about…

356
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,319
…how mad we got at each
other before.

357
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,240
And I was thinking maybe
it was partially because of how we…

358
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,720
- Rachel?
- Barry?

359
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,119
I can't. I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

360
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm still in love with you.

361
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,960
We have got to start
locking that door.

362
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,279
This is me in The Sound of Music.

363
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,640
- You see the von Trapp kids?
- No.

364
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,480
That's because I'm in front of them.

365
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,160
Yeah, I thought that was an alp.

366
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,880
Well, high school
was not my favorite time.

367
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,119
I don't know. I loved high school,
you know?

368
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,000
It was just, like, four years
of parties and dating and sex and…

369
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,119
Yeah, well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

370
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,519
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

371
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,920
Gosh, doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

372
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,559
My butt cheek is waking up.
