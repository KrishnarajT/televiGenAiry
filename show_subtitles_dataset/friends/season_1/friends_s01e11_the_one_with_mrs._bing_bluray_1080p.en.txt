1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,600
Do you think they have
yesterday's Daily News?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,680
Why?

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,200
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
Oh, my God. Phoebe. Don't look
now, but, behind you there's a guy

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,759
who has the potential to
break our hearts

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,640
and plunge us into depression.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,120
Where?

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,760
Come to Mama.

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,480
Okay, he's coming.
Be cool.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,519
- Nice hat.
- Thanks.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,960
- We should do something. Whistle.
- We're not gonna whistle.

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,079
- Yeah, come on, do it.
- No.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,160
- Do it.
- Woo-hoo!

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,679
I can't believe you did that.

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,799
Why did I woo-hoo?

16
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,280
What was I hoping?
He'd turn around and say:

17
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,319
"I love that sound.
I must have you now"?

18
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,280
I just wish there was something
we could do.

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,239
Hello. Hello, coma guy.

20
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,159
Get up, you Girl Scout! Up!

21
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,640
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Maybe nobody's tried this.

22
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,359
I wish we at least knew his name.
Would you look at that face?

23
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
Even sleeping he looks smart.
I bet he's a lawyer.

24
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,519
Yeah, but did you see the dents
in his knuckles?

25
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,040
That means he's artistic.

26
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,400
Okay. He's a lawyer
who teaches sculpting on the side.

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,719
And he can dance.

28
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,800
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're talking, he's listening,

29
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,159
and not saying,
"Yeah, I understand",

30
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,240
but wondering
what you look like naked.

31
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,400
Stop it.

32
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,719
I wish all guys could be like him.

33
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,800
I know.

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,280
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

35
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,520
- He doesn't have anyone.
- Yeah. We feel kind of responsible.

36
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,680
I can't believe you said,
"Woo-hoo."

37
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,120
I don't even say, "Woo-hoo."

38
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,639
She's coming up.

39
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,840
Folks, when we come back,

40
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,080
<i>we'll talk about her new book
Euphoria Unbound,</i>

41
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,719
<i>with always-interesting
Nora Tyler Bing.</i>

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,719
Put the kids to bed for this one.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Don't watch this.

44
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,199
Weekend at Bernie's is on Showtime
and HBO and Cinemex.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,319
- No way.
- Come on. She's your mom.

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,439
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

47
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,960
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
No?

49
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,360
Chandler, I gotta tell you I love
your mom's books. I love her books.

50
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,240
I cannot get on a plane without one.
This is so cool.

51
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,240
You wouldn't think it's cool
if you were 11,

52
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,319
and all your friends were passing
around page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,560
Come on, Chandler. I love your mom.
I think she's a blast.

54
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,520
You can say that. She's not your mom.
Please. She's the…

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,479
Hi, sweetie.

56
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,199
When did Rigatoni
get back from Rome?

57
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,159
- Last night.
- Really?

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,479
So then his plane didn't explode
in a big ball of fire?

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,520
Just a dream I had.

60
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,199
But, phew.

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,840
She's on.

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,919
Nora Bing.

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,400
Before we get to the book.

64
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,000
<i>What is this about you being
arrested in London?</i>

65
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,159
What is that about?

66
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,879
- Your mom was arrested?
- I'm busy beaming with pride.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,840
This is kind of embarrassing

68
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,159
<i>but occasionally after
I've been intimate with a man…</i>

69
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,680
Why would she say
that's embarrassing?

70
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,080
<i>I just get this craving
for Kung Pao chicken.</i>

71
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,800
That's too much information.

72
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,639
<i>So now you're doing this book
tour thing. How's that going?</i>

73
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,720
<i>Fine. I'm leaving for New York
tomorrow, which I hate.</i>

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,879
<i>But I get to see my son,
who I love.</i>

75
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,519
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,959
<i>Don't take this wrong, I just
don't see you as a mom somehow.</i>

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,360
<i>- I don't mean that bad.
- No. I'm a fabulous mom.</i>

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,839
<i>I bought my son
his first condoms.</i>

79
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,879
And then he burst into flames.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,519
Let's see. "Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction bill.

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,680
"The mayor wants to raise
subway fares again.

82
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,519
"The high today was 45."

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,560
And teams played sports.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,879
- What about Glen?
- No.

85
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,759
- He could be a Glen.
- Not special enough.

86
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,439
How about Agamemnon?

87
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,279
Way too special.

88
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm famished.
What do I want?

89
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,160
Please, God,
don't let it be Kung Pao chicken.

90
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,160
You watched the show.
What did you think?

91
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,120
I think you need
to come out of your shell just…

92
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,160
What is this dive?
Only you could've picked this place.

93
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.

94
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,079
- Hi.
- Give me a hug.

95
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,040
I think we're ready
for some tequila.

96
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
I know I am.

97
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,720
- Who's doing shots?
- Hit me.

98
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,480
- I'm in.
- There you go. Ross?

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,480
I'm not really a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

100
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,720
Hi. Sorry. Sorry we're late.
We kind of just lost track of time.

101
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,879
But a man can change.

102
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,720
Anyone want me
to appraise anything?

103
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,680
Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've
read everything you've ever written.

104
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,079
No, I mean it.
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,

105
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,800
all I wanted to do
was become a writer.

106
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,519
Please, honey.
If I can do it, anybody can.

107
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,439
You just start with half a dozen
European cities,

108
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,720
throw in 30 euphemisms
for male genitalia,

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,560
and, bam,
you have got yourself a book.

110
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,120
My mother,
ladies and gentlemen.

111
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah,
any messages for room 226?

112
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,360
- You okay, slugger?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

113
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,120
- What is with you tonight?
- Nothing.

114
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,240
Okay, thank you.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,800
It's the Italian hand-licker,
isn't it?

116
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,519
No. It's the one he's licking.

117
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,120
- She's supposed to be with you.
- You're good.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,879
Ross, listen to me. I have sold
100 million copies of my books,

119
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,120
and you know why?

120
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,680
The girl on the cover
with her nipples showing?

121
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,680
No, because I know how to write men
that women fall in love with.

122
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,759
Believe me,
I cannot sell a Paolo.

123
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,079
People will not turn 325 pages
for a Paolo.

124
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,920
Come on.
The guy's a secondary character.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,600
He's just a complication
you eventually kill off.

126
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,000
When?

127
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,639
He's not a hero.

128
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,399
You know who our hero is?

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,159
The guy on the cover
with his nipples showing?

130
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,559
No, it's you.

131
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,279
- Please.
- No, really.

132
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,399
Come on.
You're smart. You're sexy.

133
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,039
- Right.
- Come on, kiddo.

134
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,600
You're gonna be fine,
believe me.

135
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
I'll just pee in the street.

136
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,679
Is Chandler here?

137
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,519
- Yeah.
- Wait. Come here.

138
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,279
Okay, about last night,
you know…

139
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,960
Chandler. You didn't tell…

140
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,120
Okay, I'm thinking
we don't need to tell Chandler.

141
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,799
It was just a kiss. One kiss.
No big deal, right?

142
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,759
- Right. No big deal.
- Okay.

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
In Bizarro-world.

144
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,039
You broke the code.

145
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,039
- What code?
- You don't kiss your friend's mom.

146
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,720
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

147
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,639
But not a mom. Never a mom.

148
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,720
What are you guys doing out here?

149
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,279
Joey and I had discussed getting in
an early morning racquetball game.

150
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,639
But apparently
somebody overslept.

151
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,519
Yeah, well,
you don't have your racquet.

152
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,720
No. No, I don't,
because it's being restrung.

153
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,399
Somebody was supposed
to bring me one.

154
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,200
Yeah. You didn't call
and leave your grip size.

155
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,440
Okay, you guys are spending
way too much time together.

156
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,960
Okay, I'm scum.

157
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,480
- How could you let this happen?
- I don't know.

158
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,519
It's not like she's a regular mom.
You know? She's sexy. She's…

159
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,559
You don't think my mom's sexy?

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,600
Not in the same way.

161
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,399
I'll have you know
that Gloria Tribbiani

162
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
was a handsome woman
in her day, all right?

163
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,840
You think it's easy
giving birth to seven children?

164
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,799
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

165
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,480
Hey.
What are you guys doing out here?

166
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,519
Not playing racquetball.

167
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,679
- He forgot to leave his grip size.
- He didn't get the goggles.

168
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,440
Right.

169
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,679
Sounds like you two have issues.

170
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,000
Goodbye, baby.

171
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,759
Do they wait for me to do this?

172
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,600
- So are you gonna tell him?
- I'm not gonna tell him.

173
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,720
Why would I tell him?

174
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,960
How about, because if you don't,
his mother might?

175
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,320
What are you guys doing here?

176
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,320
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

177
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:38,440
What did I ask?

178
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,120
What are you doing here?

180
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by after the…

181
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,600
That I, you know.
So, what are you doing here?

182
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
I'm not really here.

183
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,879
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

184
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Do you come here a lot

185
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,039
without me?

186
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,720
No.

187
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,440
So do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

188
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,559
How would I know? I wasn't here.

189
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,879
Really? Not even
to change his pajamas?

190
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,639
- Oh, my God.
- You're my friend. I had to tell you.

191
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
I can't believe it.

192
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
Paolo kissed my mom?

193
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:47,120
Yeah, I don't know if you noticed,
but he had a lot to drink.

194
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,639
You know how he gets
when he's drunk…

195
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,399
I can't do this. I did it.

196
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,840
It was me.
I'm sorry. I kissed your mom.

197
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,720
What?

198
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,679
I was really upset
about Rachel and Paolo

199
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,440
and I think I had too much tequila,

200
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,279
and Nora, Mrs. Mom,
your Bing, was…

201
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,639
She was just being nice, you know?
But nothing happened.

202
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,320
Nothing. Ask Joey.
Joey came in…

203
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,120
You knew about this?

204
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,240
Knowledge is a tricky thing.

205
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
I spent the entire day with you.
Why didn't you tell me?

206
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,200
You're lucky
I caught them when I did,

207
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,039
or else who knows
what would've happened?

208
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,480
Thanks, man. Big help.

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,159
I can't believe this.
What the hell were you thinking?

210
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,360
I wasn't. I don't know. I…

211
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Of all my friends,

212
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,840
no one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

213
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,120
- I know.
- I can't believe you did this.

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,480
- Me neither.
- I'm mad at you for not telling me.

215
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,720
- What are you mad at me…
- Let me slam the door.

216
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Chandler, I didn't kiss her.
He did.

217
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,080
See what happens
when you break the code?

218
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,879
Joey.

219
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,080
- Rach.
- Hey.

220
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,279
"A Woman Undone.
By Rachel Karen Green."

221
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
Yeah, I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm still on the first chapter.

222
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,679
Do you think his "love stick" can be
"liberated from its denim prison"?

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,440
Yeah, I'd say so.

224
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,559
And there's no "J" in "engorged."

225
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,639
- Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

226
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

227
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:24,360
- You going to the hospital tonight?
- No. You?

228
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,120
No. You?

229
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,639
You just asked me.

230
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,639
Okay, maybe it was a trick question.

231
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,399
- Rachel, can we do this now?
- Okay.

232
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,639
I am so hot.

233
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,879
And here's a picture of my mother
and father on their wedding day.

234
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,600
Now, you tell me
she's not a knockout.

235
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,159
I cannot believe
we're having this conversation.

236
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,639
Come on, just try to picture her
not pregnant. That's all.

237
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,000
Central Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

238
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Thanks.

239
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,279
Hi. Okay.

240
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,600
I'd like to start with a song
that's about a man I recently met

241
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,679
who's come to be
very important to me.

242
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,159
Okay.

243
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,360
<i>You don't have to be awake
To be my man</i>

244
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,279
<i>Long as you have brain waves
I'll be there to hold your hand</i>

245
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,120
Though we just met the other day

246
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,279
There's something I have got to say

247
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,240
Okay, thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

248
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,919
Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay,
everybody.

249
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,879
- What the hell was that?
- Phoebe just started…

250
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,360
I believe I was talking to Joey.
All right, there, mother-kisser?

251
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,200
"Mother-kisser."

252
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,919
I'll shut up.

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,600
Chandler, can I say something?
I know you're still mad at me.

254
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,840
I just wanna say that there were
two people there that night, okay?

255
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,799
- There were two sets of lips.
- Yes, well, I expect this from her.

256
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,600
Okay? She's always been
a Freudian nightmare.

257
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,840
Okay, but if she always behaves like
this, why don't you say something?

258
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,759
Because it's complicated.
It's complex.

259
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,360
You kissed my mom.

260
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,320
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

261
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,480
- That's funny. We done now?
- No.

262
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,759
Okay, you mean you're not gonna
talk to her, tell her how you feel?

263
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,080
That would be a no. Just because
you played tonsil tennis with my mom,

264
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:39,320
doesn't mean you know her, all right?
Trust me, you can't talk to her.

265
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,600
Okay.
"You can't"? Or you can't?

266
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,120
Okay, that's my finger.
Okay, that's my knee.

267
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,840
Still doing the play.

268
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,279
All right,
what did you do with him?

269
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,359
- You're awake.
- Look at you.

270
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,480
How do you feel?

271
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,599
A little woozy,
but basically okay.

272
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,720
Gosh, you look good.

273
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,440
I feel good.

274
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,880
Who are you?

275
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,640
- Sorry.
- I'm Phoebe Buffay.

276
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,279
I'm Monica Geller.
I've been taking care of you.

277
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,400
We both have.

278
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,319
So the Etch A Sketch
is from you guys?

279
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,799
Actually, it's just from me.

280
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,400
- Yeah, I got you the foot massager.
- Know who shaved you? That was me.

281
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,200
- I read to you.
- I sang.

282
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,200
Well, thanks.

283
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,519
- Oh, my pleasure.
- You're welcome.

284
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:37,359
So I guess I'll see you around.

285
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,079
What? That's it?

286
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,400
"See you around"?

287
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,720
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

288
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,000
Maybe…

289
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,640
"That was nice."

290
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,039
"It meant something to me."

291
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:53,039
"I'll call you."

292
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,039
- All right. I'll call you.
- I don't think you mean that.

293
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,319
This is so typical.

294
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,119
We give, and we give,

295
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,759
and we give.

296
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,119
And then
we just get nothing back.

297
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,799
And then one day, it's just, you
wake up and "See you around."

298
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,720
Let's go, Phoebe.

299
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,039
You know what?
We thought you were different.

300
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,240
But I guess it was just the coma.

301
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,079
The car's running downstairs.

302
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,759
I wanted to drop off these copies
of my book for your friends.

303
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,079
Anything you want from Lisbon?

304
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,880
No, just knowing you're there
is enough.

305
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,960
All right. Be good. I love you.

306
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,079
You kissed my best Ross.

307
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,559
Or something to that effect.

308
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,480
Okay.

309
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,200
Look, it was stupid.

310
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,480
- Really stupid.
- Really stupid.

311
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,960
And I don't even know
how it happened.

312
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,680
I'm sorry, honey.
I promise it will never happen again.

313
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
- Are we okay now?
- Yeah.

314
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,119
No.

315
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,319
The forbidden love
of a man and his door.

316
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,079
He did it. He told her off.

317
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,839
And not just about the kiss,
about everything.

318
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,119
- You're kidding?
- No.

319
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,640
He said, "When are you gonna
grow up and start being a mom?"

320
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,839
Wait, then she came back with:

321
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,160
"The question is, when are you gonna
grow up and realize I have a bomb?"

322
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,799
Okay, wait.
Are you sure she didn't say:

323
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,480
"When are you gonna grow up
and realize I am your mom?"

324
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,119
- That makes more sense.
- You think?

325
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,599
Yeah.

326
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,920
So, what's going on now?

327
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,839
I don't know. I've been standing here
spelling it out for you.

328
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,160
I don't hear anything.
Wait.

329
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,480
What do you see?

330
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,400
It's hard to tell. They're
so tiny and upside down. Wait.

331
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,839
They're walking away.

332
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,119
No, they're not.
They're coming right at us. Run!

333
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,960
You okay, kiddo?

334
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:21,240
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- All right. You be good.

335
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,920
Drive safe.

336
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,359
- Mrs. Bing.
- Mr. Geller.

337
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,519
Hey.

338
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,799
You mean that?

339
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,519
Yeah, why not?

340
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,799
So I told her.

341
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,559
- How did it go?
- Awful.

342
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,400
Couldn't have gone worse.

343
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,839
- Well, how do you feel?
- Pretty good.

344
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,440
I told her.

345
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,519
Well, see?

346
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,680
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
me kissing your mom.

347
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,079
But we don't have
to go down that road.

348
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,519
Now, this is just the first chapter,

349
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,440
and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

350
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:21,119
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her "heaving beasts."

351
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
What's a "niffle"?

352
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,200
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

353
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,559
All right,
so I'm not a great typist.

354
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,440
Wait, did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

355
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:38,359
Tell you, you don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

356
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,519
- That's it. Give them back.
- No.
