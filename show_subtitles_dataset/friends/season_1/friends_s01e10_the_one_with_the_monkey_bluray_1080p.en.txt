1
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,039
Guys? There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,080
Wait. What is that?

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,079
That would be Marcel.
You wanna say hi?

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,480
No. No, I don't.

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,679
He is precious.
Where did you get him?

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,879
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,519
That is so cruel.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,559
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,399
That monkey's got a Ross
on his ass.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,320
Ross, is he gonna live with you
in your apartment?

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,719
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so…

12
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,640
Why don't you just get a roommate?

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,799
I don't know.
You reach a certain age,

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,799
having a roommate
is just kind of pathe…

15
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,600
Sorry, that's "pathet,"

16
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,280
which is Sanskrit
for "really cool way to live."

17
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,200
You guys,
I'm doing all-new material tonight.

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,719
I have 12 new songs
about my mother's suicide,

19
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,040
and one about a snowman.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Might want to open
with the snowman.

21
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,519
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,680
- Hey, Joe.
- So how'd it go?

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,120
I didn't get the job.

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,879
How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,919
I don't know. Some fat guy's
sleeping with the store manager.

26
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,199
He's not even jolly.
It's all political.

27
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,360
- So, what are you gonna be?
- I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

28
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:23,240
It's just such a slap in the face.

29
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,400
Do you guys know
what you're doing for New Year's?

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,639
Gee, what?
What is wrong with New Year's?

31
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,280
Nothing for you. You have Paolo.

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,879
You don't have to face the horrible
pressures of this holiday,

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,919
desperate scramble
to find anything with lips,

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,120
just so can have somebody to kiss
when the ball drops.

35
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,560
Man, I'm talking loud.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,879
For your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,039
So I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,960
Yeah, you wish.

39
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,840
It's just that I'm sick of being
a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.

40
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:57,360
I say this year, no dates,
we make a pact.

41
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,240
Just the six of us. Dinner.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,199
- Sure.
- Fine.

43
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,639
I was hoping
for a little more enthusiasm.

44
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,560
Okay.

45
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,919
- Phoebe, you're on.
- Oh, good.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,639
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand

47
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,560
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,439
Thanks. Hi.

49
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,879
I want to start with a song that
means a lot to me this time of year.

50
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,199
I made a man with eyes of coal

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,879
And a smile so bewitchin'

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,560
How was I supposed to know

53
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,400
<i>That my mom
was dead in the kitchen?</i>

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,039
My mother's ashes

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,319
Even her eyelashes

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:02,039
Are resting in a little yellow jar

57
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,039
And sometimes when it's freezing

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,599
I feel a little sneezy

59
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,120
<i>And now I…
Excuse me?</i>

60
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,800
Yeah, noisy boys.

61
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,279
Is it something that you'd like
to share with the group?

62
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,839
No, that's okay.

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,000
Come on, if it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing

64
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,040
then I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

65
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,399
That guy's going home
with a note.

66
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,279
- Nothing. I was just saying…
- Could you speak up?

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,319
Sorry.
I was just saying to my friend,

68
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,079
you were the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,800
And you said Daryl Hannah
was the most beautiful woman

70
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,399
that he'd ever seen in his life.

71
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,199
And I said, yeah,
I liked her in Splash,

72
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,680
but not so much in Wall Street.

73
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,360
- I thought she had a hard quality.
- A hard quality.

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,040
And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way,

75
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,399
you are luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

76
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,000
Then that's
when you started yelling.

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Okay,
we're gonna take a short break.

78
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,399
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

79
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,519
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,399
God, by my sixth date
with Paolo,

82
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,240
he had already named
both my breasts.

83
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,199
Did I just share too much?

84
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,879
Just a smidge.

85
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
David's like a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,040
- I think it's romantic.
- Me too.

87
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

88
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,319
Yeah.

89
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,639
He's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

90
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,160
Except…

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,120
Except he's smarter
and gentler and sweeter.

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,399
I just want to be with him
all the time.

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,120
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

94
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,600
And special occasions.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
Wait a minute.
I see where this is going.

96
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,000
You're gonna ask him
to New Year's.

97
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,399
You're gonna break the pact.
She's gonna break the pact.

98
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,279
No.

99
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
Yeah, could I just?

100
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,519
Yeah, because I already
asked Janice.

101
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
You what?

102
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,399
Come on, this was a pact.
This was your pact.

103
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,079
I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle
the pressure and I snapped.

104
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,199
Yeah, but Janice? That was
the worst breakup in history.

105
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,639
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I'm saying I snapped.

106
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,519
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.

107
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,800
Too many jokes.

108
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,199
Must mock Joey.

109
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,680
Nice shoes.

110
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,199
You're killing me.

111
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,399
Ross.
He's playing with my spatulas again.

112
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,959
He's not gonna hurt them, right?

113
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,879
Do you always have
to bring him here?

114
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,360
I didn't want to leave him alone,
all right?

115
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,800
We had our first fight this morning.

116
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,560
I think it has to do
with my working late.

117
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,279
I said some things
that I didn't mean.

118
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,399
He threw some feces.

119
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,399
If you're gonna work late,
I can look in on him for you.

120
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
That would be great. Okay.

121
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,959
But if you do, make sure it seems
like you're there to see him, okay?

122
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,560
And you're not, like,
doing it as a favor to me.

123
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to lie.

124
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,399
But you can't actually test
this theory.

125
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,879
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough

126
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,839
to simulate these conditions.

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,519
- Okay. I have a question then.
- Yeah.

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,439
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

129
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,600
That's definitely a valid question,

130
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,240
and the answer would be yes.

131
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,759
Yes, I was.

132
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,120
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss,

133
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,440
that happened at this phenomenal
moment because it's you.

134
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,519
Sure. Yeah.

135
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,840
Right. But, see, the longer I waited,

136
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:49,639
the more phenomenal
the kiss had to be.

137
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,159
And now, we've reached a place

138
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,919
where it's just got to be
one of those things where

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,559
I sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

140
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,519
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

141
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,840
David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of fella.

142
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,919
You're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

143
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,720
- Really.
- Yeah. I'm sure of it.

144
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,360
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me.

145
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,879
- Now?
- Right now. Just…

146
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,039
Okay.

147
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,240
You know what?
This is just really expensive.

148
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,720
Okay.
And I'll tell you, this was a gift.

149
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,720
So now you're just
kind of tidying up.

150
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,080
Okay, what the hell?

151
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,279
- You want me to actually throw you…
- I can hop.

152
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,840
Now, tell me something, what does
the phase "no-date pact" mean to you?

153
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm sorry, okay?

154
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,720
It's just that Chandler has somebody
and Phoebe has somebody.

155
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:06,000
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

156
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,720
Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend,
Fun Bobby?

157
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,799
- Yeah.
- You know more than one Fun Bobby?

158
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

159
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,559
Okay. Here we go.

160
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,120
There's no room for milk.

161
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,360
There. Now there is.

162
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,519
Okay, so on our no-date evening,

163
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,759
three of you now
are gonna have dates.

164
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,039
- Four.
- Four.

165
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,600
- Five.
- Five.

166
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,799
Sorry.
Paolo's catching an earlier flight.

167
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,399
Yeah, and I met this really hot
single mom at the store.

168
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
What's an elf to do?

169
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,200
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one
standing there alone,

170
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,399
when the ball drops?

171
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,320
Come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

172
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,480
This is so not what I needed now.

173
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,039
- What's the matter?
- It's Marcel.

174
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,639
He keeps shutting me out.

175
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,120
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

176
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,799
That's so weird. I had such a blast
with him the other night.

177
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,000
- Really?
- Yeah, we played. We watched TV.

178
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,440
That juggling thing is amazing.

179
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,320
What?

180
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,240
What juggling thing?

181
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,759
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

182
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,759
No.

183
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:26,679
It wasn't that big a deal.
Just balled-up socks.

184
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,759
And a melon.

185
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,200
- Phoebe. Hi.
- Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

186
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,000
No. Have you seen David?

187
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,879
No, he hasn't been around.

188
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,320
If you see him, tell him to pack
his bags. We are going to Minsk.

189
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,519
- Minsk?
- Minsk. It's in Russia.

190
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,480
I know where Minsk is.

191
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,080
We got the grant.
Three years, all expenses paid.

192
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,600
- So when do you leave?
- January 1st.

193
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,399
Hello?

194
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,759
- Hey.
- Hi.

195
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,960
- What are you doing here?
- Max told me about Minsk.

196
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,960
So you know, congratulations.
This is so exciting!

197
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,799
Yeah.

198
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,840
It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

199
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,360
You're not going? Why?

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,120
Tell her, David.

201
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,320
"I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

202
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,000
No. I want to stay here
and make out with my girlfriend."

203
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,679
Okay, thank you, Max.
Thank you.

204
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,840
So you're really not going?

205
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,960
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just…

206
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,120
You decide.

207
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,399
- Don't do that.
- Please?

208
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,559
No, but I'm asking you.
I can't make a decision.

209
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,120
- I can't. Please, just…
- Okay. Stay.

210
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,679
- Stay.
- Stay.

211
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,480
Getting so good at that.

212
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,639
It was Max's stuff.

213
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,240
I love this artichoke thing.

214
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,679
Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

215
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,840
You remember Janice.

216
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,440
Vividly.

217
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,559
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Sandy.

218
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,480
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

219
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,360
- You brought your kids.
- Yeah. That's okay, right?

220
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,200
Party.

221
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,000
That thing is not coming in here.

222
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,519
"That thing"? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

223
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,879
Let me ask you something. If
I showed up with my new girlfriend,

224
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,799
she wouldn't be welcome?

225
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,639
I'm thinking your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

226
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,360
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

227
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,759
Okay? And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here

228
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,559
like nothing happened…

229
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:30,759
All right.
Just keep him away from me.

230
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,279
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

231
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,159
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

232
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,919
All right,
I'll catch up with you later.

233
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,120
Oh, my gosh. Rachel, honey,

234
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,120
are you okay? Where's Paolo?

235
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,759
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

236
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,039
And then your face exploded?

237
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,559
No. Okay.

238
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,320
I was at the airport
getting into a cab

239
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,600
when this woman,
this blond planet with a pocketbook

240
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,879
starts yelling at me.

241
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,639
Something about
how it was her cab first.

242
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,720
And the next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair.

243
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,600
And I started blowing
my attack whistle thingy,

244
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,639
and then three more cabs show up.

245
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,919
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me.

246
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

247
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,000
Everybody having fun at the party?

248
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,240
Are people eating my dip?

249
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,080
When I saw you
at the store last week,

250
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,919
it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
That's dirty.

252
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,480
Yeah.

253
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,840
Hey, kids.

254
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:16,159
Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me,

255
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,279
but at least check in.

256
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:21,159
There you are.

257
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:25,399
You got away from me.

258
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,600
But you found me.

259
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,480
Here, Ross, take our picture.

260
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,960
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

261
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,720
Kill me. Kill me now.

262
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,000
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

263
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,639
Fun Bobby!

264
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,840
Hey, Bobby.

265
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,320
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my
grandfather died about two hours ago.

266
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,200
But I couldn't get a flight out
till tomorrow, so here I am.

267
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,559
Hey, Fun Bobby.
How's it going, man?

268
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,440
Who died?

269
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,920
It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,559
So at least
I'll get to see him again.

271
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,839
I'm gonna blow this one up and I'm
gonna write "Reunited" in glitter.

272
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,119
All right, Janice, that's it!

273
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,759
Janice?

274
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,440
Janice?

275
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,640
When I invited you to this party,
I didn't think it meant that we…

276
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,440
Oh, no.

277
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,960
- I'm sorry you misunderstood.
- Oh, my God.

278
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,799
You listen to me, Chandler.
You listen to me.

279
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,200
One of these times, it's just gonna
be your last chance with me.

280
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Will you give me the thing?

281
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,400
- Hi, Max.
- Yoko.

282
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,759
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

283
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,160
It won't be the same,

284
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,200
but it will still be Minsk.

285
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,839
Happy New Year.

286
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,119
Are you all right?

287
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,920
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

288
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,839
- You're going to Minsk.
- No, I'm not going to Minsk.

289
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,680
You are so going to Minsk.

290
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,759
You belong in Minsk. You can't stay
here just because of me.

291
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:36,359
Yes, I can. Because if I go, it means
I have to break up with you.

292
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,480
- And I can't break up with you.
- Yes. Yes, you can.

293
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,880
Just say "Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

294
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,759
"And that's what I have to do
right now."

295
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,559
And I say, "Your work?
How can you say that?"

296
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,839
And then you say,
"It's tearing me apart,

297
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,640
"but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?"

298
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,440
And I say,
"No. I can't understand that."

299
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,640
Sorry.

300
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,759
And then you put
your arms around me…

301
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,640
And then you put your arms
around me.

302
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,799
Sorry.

303
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,440
And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

304
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,640
I'll never forget you.

305
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,000
And then you say that it's
almost midnight and you have to go,

306
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,599
because you don't want to start
the new year with me

307
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,079
if you can't finish it.

308
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,119
I'm gonna miss you,
you scientist guy.

309
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,319
<i>Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.</i>

310
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,240
<i>We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.</i>

311
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,079
<i>It gets bigger
and better every year.</i>

312
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,839
Here you go, kids.

313
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:51,799
And then the peacock bit me.

314
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,599
Please kiss me at midnight.

315
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,599
You seen Sandy?

316
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,640
I don't know how to tell you this,

317
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,319
but she's in Monica's bedroom getting
it on with Max, that scientist geek.

318
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,880
Look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

319
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,240
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

320
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,680
What?

321
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,000
The ball is dropping.

322
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,000
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

323
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,839
And the moment of joy is upon us.

324
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,119
Looks like that "no-date pact" thing
worked out.

325
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,960
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that.

326
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:32,240
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby.

327
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,599
One. Happy New Year!

328
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,960
I just thought I'd throw this
out there. I'm no math whiz,

329
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,440
but I do believe there are three
girls and three guys right here.

330
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,640
I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

331
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,759
- I can't kiss anyone.
- So I'm kissing everyone?

332
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,559
No. You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

333
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,359
Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

334
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,680
All right. Somebody kiss me.
Somebody kiss me. It's midnight.

335
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,839
All right.

336
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,079
There.

337
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
I wanted this to work so much.

338
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm still in there, you know?

339
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,039
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

340
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,000
But he's just phoning it in.

341
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,759
It's just so hard to accept
that something you love so much,

342
