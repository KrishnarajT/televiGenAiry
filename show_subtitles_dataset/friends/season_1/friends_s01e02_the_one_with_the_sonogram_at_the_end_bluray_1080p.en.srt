1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,319
What you guys don't understand is

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,599
for us, kissing is as important
as any part of it.

3
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,320
Yeah, right.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,720
- You serious?
- Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,199
Everything you need to know
is in that first kiss.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,320
Absolutely.

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,359
Yeah, I think, for us, kissing
is pretty much like an opening act.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,879
It's like the stand-up comedian
you have to sit through,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,039
before Pink Floyd comes out.

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,559
Yeah, and it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,079
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,799
See, the problem is, though,

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,399
after the concert's over,
no matter how great the show was,

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,719
you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

15
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,039
We're in the car,
we're fighting traffic,

16
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,679
basically just trying
to stay awake.

17
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:55,560
Yeah, well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,640
Otherwise,
you're gonna find yourself

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,119
sitting at home
listening to that album alone.

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,920
Are we still talking about sex?

21
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:04,680
No, it's good. It's just that,
doesn't she seem a little angry?

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,599
She has issues.

23
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,879
Does she?

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,919
He's out banging other women
over the head with a club,

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,879
while she sits at home trying to get
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

26
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,039
Marsha, see,
these are cave people.

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,280
Okay, they have issues like:

28
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,280
"Gee, that glacier's getting
kind of close." See?

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,719
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,479
- No.
- Yes, it is. Carol, hi.

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,960
Okay. Yes. Yes, it is.

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,439
How about I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age?

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,439
- Hi.
- Hi.

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
So…

35
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,400
You look great.

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
I hate that.

37
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,520
Sorry. Thanks.
You look good too.

38
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,319
In here, anyone who

39
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,039
stands erect…

40
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,319
- So, what's new? Still a…
- A lesbian?

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,840
Well…

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
You never know.

43
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,439
How's… How's the family?

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,120
Marty's still totally paranoid.

45
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,080
- And…
- Carol, why are you here, Carol?

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,039
- I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant.

47
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,599
<i>Looks like she didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.</i>

48
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,159
I think this is the episode
of Three's Company,

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,840
where's there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,479
Then I've already seen this one.

51
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,000
Are you through with that?
Thanks.

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,319
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

53
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,479
- Whose little ball of paper is this?
- That would be mine.

54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,439
See, I wrote a note to myself,
then I didn't need it.

55
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,759
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,800
She already fluffed that pillow.
Monica, you already fluffed…

57
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,879
But it's fine.

58
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,879
I'm sorry. I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

59
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,879
Yes, we know how cruel
a parent can be

60
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,879
about the flatness
of a child's pillow.

61
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,600
Monica? Hi.

62
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,680
Monica, you're scaring me.

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,600
You're, like, all chaotic and twirly.

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,759
Not in a good way.

65
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,879
Yeah, calm down.

66
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:45,040
You don't see Ross getting
all chaotic and twirly

67
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,240
every time they come.

68
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,120
That's because, as far as my parents
are concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

69
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,279
You see, he's the prince.

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,519
Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,560
- What?
- Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

72
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,000
Has anybody seen
my engagement ring?

73
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,560
Yeah, it's beautiful.

74
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,079
Oh, God.

75
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,399
- Oh, God.
- No, don't touch that.

76
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,800
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough having to give it back to him.

77
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,399
"Hi, Barry, remember me?

78
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,160
"I'm the girl that stomped on your
heart in front of your entire family"

79
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,560
Oh, God. Now I'm gonna have
to return the ring, without the ring,

80
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,319
which makes it so much harder.

81
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,040
Easy, Rach, we'll find it.
Won't we?

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,879
- Yeah.
- Okay, look.

83
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,000
When did you have it on last?

84
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,360
Doy. Probably right before
she lost it.

85
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,160
You don't get a lot of "doy"
these days.

86
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,639
I know I had it this morning.

87
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,600
I know I had it
when I was in the kitchen with…

88
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,160
Dinah?

89
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,360
Don't be mad.

90
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,079
- You didn't.
- I'm sorry.

91
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,480
I gave you one job.

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,600
But look how straight
those noodles are.

93
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,240
You know that's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

94
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
I just can't do it.

95
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,600
Boys?

96
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,879
We're going in.

97
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,360
Hi.

98
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,199
- That is not a happy "hi."
- Carol's pregnant.

99
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,439
I found it.

100
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,759
What?

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,439
Yeah.

102
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,720
Do that for another two hours, you
might be where I am right about now.

103
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Kind of puts that whole pillow thing
in perspective, huh, Mon?

104
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Well, now, how do you fit
into this whole thing?

105
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,319
Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

106
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,759
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,199
- Basically, it's totally up to me.
- She is so great. I miss her.

108
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,759
What does she mean
by "involved"?

109
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,240
Presumably,
the biggest part of your job is done.

110
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Anyway,

111
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,600
they want me to go down to this
sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

112
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,959
- So, what are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

113
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,439
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

114
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,720
This is still ruined, right?

115
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,240
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna call you.

116
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,600
What's that curry taste?

117
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,279
Curry.

118
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,720
- I think they're great. I really do.
- You remember the Lugwins?

119
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
The big one had a thing for you,
didn't she?

120
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,480
- They all had a thing for him.
- Oh, Mom.

121
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,680
I'm sorry.
Why is this girl going to call me?

122
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,199
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food,

123
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,480
or I don't know.

124
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,960
Anyway, I told her
you had a restaurant, so…

125
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,720
No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

126
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,279
They don't have to know that.

127
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,799
Ross, could you come
and help me with the spaghetti.

128
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes.

129
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,679
We're having spaghetti.
That's easy.

130
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,759
I know this is going to sound
unbelievably selfish on my part,

131
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,039
but were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

132
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,639
Because I think it might take
some of the heat off me.

133
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,519
What that Rachel did to her life.
We ran into her parents at the club.

134
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
They were not playing very well.

135
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:11,240
I'm not gonna tell you
what they spent on that wedding,

136
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,399
but $40,000 is a lot of money.

137
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,759
At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

138
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,440
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

139
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,000
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

140
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,320
Don't listen to your mother.

141
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,399
You're independent
and you always have been.

142
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,960
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby,

143
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:37,679
and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

144
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,399
You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles…

145
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,799
Look, there are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

146
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,720
With his museum and his papers
getting published.

147
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,080
Other people are satisfied
with staying where they are.

148
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer.

149
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,279
And I read about these women
trying to have it all,

150
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,440
and I thank God our little Harmonica
doesn't seem to have that problem.

151
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,639
So, Ross,
what's going on with you?

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,759
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

153
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Okay.

154
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:26,480
I realize you guys
have been wondering

155
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,200
what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

156
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,919
And so, here's the deal.

157
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,240
Carol's a lesbian.

158
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,559
She's living with a woman
named Susan.

159
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,399
She's pregnant with my child.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,799
And she and Susan
are going to raise the baby.

161
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,279
And you knew about this?

162
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,080
Your folks are really that bad.

163
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,600
These people are pros.

164
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,440
They know what they're doing.
They take their time.

165
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
They get the job done.

166
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:24,960
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

167
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,960
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

168
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,399
Must pee.

169
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,320
It's even worse
when you're twins.

170
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,600
- You're a twin?
- Yeah. We don't speak.

171
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,279
She's like this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

172
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,360
- What does she do?
- She's a waitress.

173
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,559
All right. You guys,
I kind of gotta clean up now.

174
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,519
Chandler, you're an only child,
right? You don't have any of this.

175
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,879
No, although
I did have an imaginary friend,

176
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,720
who my parents actually preferred.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,879
Hit the lights, please.

178
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,240
How long was I in there?

179
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,080
I'm just cleaning up.

180
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,120
Do you need any help?

181
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,159
Okay, sure. Thanks.

182
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,960
Anyway…

183
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,519
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

184
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,879
A little.

185
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,480
A lot.

186
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,519
So got any advice?

187
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,360
As someone
who's recently been dumped.

188
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,879
You may want to steer clear
of the word "dumped."

189
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,480
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

190
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,360
So you should try not to look
too terrific. I know it'll be hard.

191
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:00,120
Or I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

192
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,279
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the OB-GYN.

193
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,799
You've got Carol tomorrow.

194
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,919
- When did it get so complicated?
- Got me.

195
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,200
Remember when we were
in high school?

196
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,279
Yeah.

197
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,879
Didn't you think
you' were gonna meet someone,

198
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,320
fall in love, and that'd be it?

199
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
- Ross?
- Yes.

200
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,080
Man. I never thought I'd be here.

201
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,279
Me neither.

202
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,159
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I got stuck at work.

203
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,480
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway…

204
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
Hi.

205
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,759
- Ross, you remember Susan.
- How could I forget?

206
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,600
- Ross.
- Hello, Susan. Good shake.

207
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,240
So, we're just waiting for?

208
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,639
- Dr. Oberman.
- Dr. Oberman. Okay, and is he…

209
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,320
- She.
- Of course, "she."

210
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
She familiar
with our special situation?

211
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,240
- Yes, and she's very supportive.
- Great. Okay, that's great.

212
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,279
No, I'm…

213
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,639
Thanks.

214
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,000
Quack, quack…

215
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,519
Ross?

216
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,360
That opens my cervix.

217
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,679
- Barry?
- Come on in.

218
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,799
Are you sure?

219
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,159
It's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

220
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,200
So how are you doing?

221
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,919
I'm…

222
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,320
I'm okay.

223
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,679
- You look great.
- Yeah, well…

224
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,120
<i>Dr. Farber,
Jason Greenspan's gagging.</i>

225
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,759
Be right there.
I'll be back in a second.

226
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,080
I dumped him.

227
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
Okay.

228
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,559
So how's this going to work
with us?

229
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,840
When, like, important
decisions have to be made?

230
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,440
- Give me a "for instance."
- I don't know. Okay.

231
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,879
- How about with the baby's name?
- Marlon…

232
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,559
- Marlon.
- If it's a boy.

233
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,080
Minnie, if it's a girl.

234
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,120
As in "Mouse"?

235
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:20,919
As in my grandmother.

236
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,679
Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

237
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,200
How about…

238
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,919
- How about "Julia"?
- Julia.

239
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,759
We agreed on Minnie.

240
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,200
It's funny, we agreed
we'd spend our lives together.

241
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,120
Things change.
Roll with the punches.

242
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,480
I believe Julia's on the table.

243
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:45,759
Sorry about that.

244
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:53,159
- So, what have you been up to?
- Not much.

245
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,960
- I got a job.
- That's great.

246
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,320
- Why are you so tan?
- I…

247
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,919
I went to Aruba.

248
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,119
No.
You went on our honeymoon alone?

249
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,559
No.

250
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,359
See, I went with…

251
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,359
- Now, this may hurt.
- Me?

252
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,559
No.

253
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:23,880
- I went with Mindy.
- Mindy?

254
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:28,799
- My maid of honor, Mindy?
- Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

255
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,079
I'm…

256
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,119
You got plugs.

257
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,839
Careful.
They haven't quite taken yet.

258
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,680
And you got lenses.

259
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,680
But you hate sticking your finger
in your eye.

260
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,319
Not for her.

261
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,319
Listen,
I really wanted to thank you.

262
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,319
Okay.

263
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,039
About a month ago,
I wanted to hurt you

264
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,920
more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone in my life.

265
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,279
And I'm an orthodontist.

266
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,319
You were right.
I thought we were happy.

267
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,640
We weren't happy.

268
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,680
But with Mindy,

269
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,160
now I'm happy.

270
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,720
- Spit.
- What?

271
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,400
Me.

272
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,440
Anyway…

273
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,200
I guess this belongs to you.

274
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,119
And thank you for giving it to me.

275
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:32,039
Thank you for giving it back.

276
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,039
Hello.

277
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:43,440
- Please. What's wrong with Helen?
- Helen Geller?

278
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:48,240
- I don't think so.
- It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

279
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,440
- Thank you.
- No. It's not Geller.

280
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,640
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

281
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,279
No, actually we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

282
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,160
Wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

283
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,680
Because it's my baby too.

284
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,839
That's funny. Really? I don't
remember you making any sperm.

285
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:13,119
And we all know
what a challenge that is.

286
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,079
- See?
- All right, you two, stop it.

287
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,519
No. She gets a credit.
I'm in there too.

288
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:18,599
Honestly.

289
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,519
You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick Bunch Geller.

290
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,240
I think that borders on child abuse.

291
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:27,079
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

292
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,640
No.
You see what he's doing?

293
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,599
He knows no one
is gonna say all those names.

294
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,319
He knows they'll wind up calling
her Geller. Then he gets his way.

295
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
My way?
You think this is my way?

296
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,240
Believe me, of all the ways I ever
imagined this moment in my life being

297
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,799
this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

298
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,599
Knock, knock.
How are we today? Any nausea?

299
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,400
- A little.
- Just a little.

300
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,880
I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

301
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,079
Lie back.

302
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,119
You know what? I'm gonna go.

303
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,160
I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

304
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,920
- Oh, my God.
- Look at that.

305
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,319
I know.

306
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,079
Isn't that amazing?

307
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,319
What are we supposed
to be seeing here?

308
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,240
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

309
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,119
If you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes,

310
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,279
it kind of looks like an old potato.

311
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,559
Then don't do that, all right?

312
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,039
Monica?

313
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,519
What do you think?

314
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,839
Are you welling up?

315
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,240
- No.
- You are.

316
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,599
- You are. You're welling up.
- No, I'm not.

317
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,599
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Shut up.

318
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,319
Hi, Mindy.

319
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,519
Hi, it's Rachel.

320
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,359
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

321
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,160
Yeah, he told me.

322
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,960
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

323
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,680
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

324
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,920
And, Min,
if everything works out,

325
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,079
and you guys end up getting married
and having kids and everything,

326
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,319
I just hope they have his
old hairline and your old nose.

327
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,559
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
