1
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,810
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,187
Come on.
You're going out with a guy.

3
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,898
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

4
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:59,983
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

5
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:03,821
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

6
00:01:05,073 --> 00:01:08,283
I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl. Oh.

7
00:01:08,493 --> 00:01:11,286
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

8
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:14,456
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

9
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,208
Sounds like a date to me.

10
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,922
I'm back in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria...

11
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:25,467
and I realize I'm totally naked.

12
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:27,219
- Oh, yeah.
- I've had that dream.

13
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:31,515
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

14
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,059
there.

15
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:36,895
- Instead of...
- That's right!

16
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:38,605
- That one, I've never had.
- No.

17
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:42,901
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

18
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,862
And it turns out it's my mother.

19
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:50,909
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

20
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,833
Hi.

21
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:02,004
This guy says "hello,"
I wanna kill myself.

22
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:03,463
Are you okay, sweetie?

23
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:08,385
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...

24
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:11,430
and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

25
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,933
Carol moved her stuff out today.

26
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:16,185
Oh.

27
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:18,145
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

28
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,858
Ew. Unh.

29
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:26,987
No. No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

30
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,823
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

31
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:34,703
I'll be fine. All right? Really.
I hope she'll be very happy.

32
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,205
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

33
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,207
To hell with her. She left me!

34
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,210
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

35
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:47,424
No! Okay?

36
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:50,385
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

37
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:54,806
She didn't know. How should I know?

38
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,311
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

39
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,940
Did I say that out loud?

40
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:08,946
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

41
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:11,531
You're angry. You're hurting.

42
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,992
Can I tell you what the answer is?

43
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:15,494
Strip joints!

44
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,998
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

45
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,501
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

46
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,879
I just wanna be married again.

47
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,136
And I just want a million dollars!

48
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:35,347
Rachel?

49
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,225
Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!

50
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:41,561
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

51
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,939
that you might be here, and you are.

52
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,693
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

53
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:52,239
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

54
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,950
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

55
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,411
and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

56
00:03:57,578 --> 00:03:58,704
- Sure!
- Hey.

57
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,789
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

58
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:12,175
So you wanna tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

59
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:19,391
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

60
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,977
I was in this room
with all the presents...

61
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,979
and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

62
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:27,607
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

63
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,609
When all of a sudden...
Sweet 'N Low?

64
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:31,903
I realized...

65
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,991
I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

66
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,202
Then I got really freaked out,
and that's when it hit me:

67
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,164
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

68
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,834
You know, I mean, I always knew
he looked familiar, but...

69
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:51,340
Anyway, I just had to get out of there,
and I started wondering:

70
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:55,177
"Why am I doing this?"
And "Who am I doing this for?"

71
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:59,723
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go,
and I know you and I have drifted apart...

72
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,768
but you're the only person
I know in the city.

73
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:04,644
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

74
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,939
Oh, I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

75
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,623
I'm guessing he bought her
the big pipe organ...

76
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,250
and she's really not
happy about it.

77
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:31,546
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.

78
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,382
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,426
I just don't love him.

80
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:39,554
Well, it matters to me.

81
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:44,434
She should not be wearing those pants.

82
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,604
I say push her down the stairs.

83
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,024
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

84
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,280
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

85
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,035
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!

86
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:04,287
You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

87
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,666
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

88
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:11,044
What if I wanna be a purse?
You know?

89
00:06:11,212 --> 00:06:13,004
Or a hat?"

90
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,466
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat.

91
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:18,844
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

92
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:22,431
You can see where he'd have trouble.

93
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,561
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

94
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:31,356
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

95
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,862
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

96
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:41,741
Well, maybe that's my decision.

97
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:44,578
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

98
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,997
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

99
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:56,173
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.

100
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,842
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

101
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,929
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

102
00:07:03,306 --> 00:07:07,267
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

103
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,396
La la la something
With string

104
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm all better now.

105
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,235
I helped.

106
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,239
Look, this is probably
for the best, you know?

107
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,117
Independence. Taking control of your life.

108
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:28,663
And, hey, if you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

109
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:32,250
Me and Chandler live right
across the hall. And he's away a lot.

110
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:36,671
Joey, stop hitting on her.
It's her wedding day.

111
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,840
What? Like there's a rule or something?

112
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:44,930
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

113
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,516
- Uh, it's Paul.
- Buzz him in.

114
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:50,101
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

115
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,353
Maybe.

116
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:54,856
Wait a minute. Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

117
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:56,858
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes.

118
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,818
Ooh. This is a "Dear Diary" moment.

119
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:01,863
Rach, wait, I can cancel.

120
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,907
Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.

121
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:07,786
Ross, are you okay?
I mean, do you want me to stay?

122
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:10,789
That'd be good.

123
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:14,918
- Really?
- No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

124
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:21,174
Hi, come in. Paul, this is...

125
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,594
everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

126
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,096
Paul, the wine guy.

127
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:30,141
- Wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,103
- Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.
- Okay.

129
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:40,360
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

130
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:44,781
So, Rachel,
what are you up to tonight?

131
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,160
Well, I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

132
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,370
so, nothing.

133
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,000
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

134
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:59,254
God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh.
This time of year? Eh.

135
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:02,007
Talk about your...

136
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,216
big lizards.

137
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,724
Anyway, if you don't feel
like being alone tonight...

138
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,768
Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

139
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:17,105
Yes, and we're very excited about it.

140
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:20,609
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna
hang out here tonight.

141
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:22,819
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.

142
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:24,321
Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?

143
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,698
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

144
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:39,336
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

145
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:42,297
using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

146
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:48,219
I have no bracket-y thing,
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

147
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,473
and I cannot feel my legs.

148
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,100
What's this?

149
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,312
I have no idea.

150
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,608
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

151
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:06,988
This was Carol's favorite beer.

152
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,743
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

153
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,121
Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.

154
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:19,501
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

155
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:20,710
What did you get?

156
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,087
You guys.

157
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,339
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- You got screwed.

158
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:28,843
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.

159
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:33,932
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

160
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,309
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

161
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:38,895
My brother's going through that.
He's such a mess.

162
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,730
How did you get through it?

163
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,442
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

164
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,194
- Say her...
- Leg?

165
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:48,279
Heh. That's one way of going through it,
yeah.

166
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:50,365
Me, I went for the watch.

167
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,701
- You actually broke her watch?
- Mm.

168
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:56,413
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

169
00:10:56,664 --> 00:11:01,584
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

170
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:04,587
It isn't, it's about me. And I...

171
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,681
Hi. Machine cut me off again.
Anyway...

172
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:20,562
You know what's scary? What if
there's only one woman for everybody?

173
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:24,107
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

174
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:29,154
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

175
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:32,866
What are you talking about?
One woman.

176
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:37,078
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

177
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:40,999
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

178
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:45,628
There's rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

179
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:50,759
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

180
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,678
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you.

181
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,723
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

182
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,687
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

183
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,398
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

184
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,233
Then stay out of my freezer.

185
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:14,407
Ever since she walked out on me, I...

186
00:12:14,742 --> 00:12:16,701
What? What?

187
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,703
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

188
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:22,499
No, it's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

189
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:26,336
Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?

190
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,547
Isn't there?

191
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:31,925
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

192
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:35,470
What were you gonna say?

193
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,224
Well... Er, uh...

194
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,602
Ever since she left me, um...

195
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:47,023
I haven't been able to perform...

196
00:12:47,274 --> 00:12:48,483
sexually.

197
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:52,862
Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...

198
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,280
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

199
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,909
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

200
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,786
Um...

201
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,246
How long?

202
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:02,872
Two years.

203
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:05,333
Wow!

204
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,461
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

205
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,842
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

206
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,388
Yeah.

207
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,390
Yeah, I do.

208
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,936
I, Joanie, take you, Charles,
as my lawful husband.

209
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,523
- Do you take Joanie...?
- Oh! See.

210
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:33,903
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

211
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,823
"Grab a spoon. "

212
00:13:37,157 --> 00:13:39,659
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

213
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,996
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

214
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:49,752
You know, here's the thing.
Even if I could get it together enough...

215
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,463
to ask a woman out...

216
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:55,341
who am I gonna ask?

217
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,031
Isn't this amazing?

218
00:14:18,198 --> 00:14:20,533
I mean, I have never made coffee
before in my life.

219
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:23,202
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

220
00:14:23,412 --> 00:14:28,124
While you're on a roll, if you feel like you
gotta make a Western omelet or something...

221
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:34,505
Although, actually I'm really
not that hungry this morning.

222
00:14:35,424 --> 00:14:36,758
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

223
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,551
- Morning.
- Morning.

224
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,638
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.

225
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:45,016
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

226
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,898
I had a really great time last night.

227
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,942
Thank you. Thank you so much.

228
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:57,528
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Yeah.

229
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,035
Thank you.

230
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,669
That wasn't a real date.

231
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,214
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

232
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,551
- Shut up and put my table back.
- Okay.

233
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,595
All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

234
00:15:22,805 --> 00:15:28,309
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

235
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:33,481
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

236
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:35,942
Yeah, we all have jobs.

237
00:15:36,151 --> 00:15:38,778
See, that's how we buy stuff.

238
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,698
Yeah, I'm an actor.

239
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,117
Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?

240
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,661
Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

241
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,456
Unless you happened to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

242
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,251
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. "

243
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,797
I will not take this abuse.

244
00:15:58,048 --> 00:15:59,966
You're right. I'm sorry.

245
00:16:00,384 --> 00:16:03,094
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

246
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:09,517
So how are you doing today?
Did you sleep okay?

247
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,062
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

248
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,734
I can see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

249
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,451
I know. He's just so...

250
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,161
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

251
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,373
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, it's like that. With feelings.

252
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,917
Oh, wow, are you in trouble!

253
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:39,380
Okay, okay. I am just going to get up,
go to work...

254
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:42,258
and not think about him all day.

255
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:45,386
Or else I'm just gonna
get up and go to work.

256
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:47,180
- Oh, wish me luck!
- What for?

257
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,683
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

258
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,277
- Hey, Monica.
- Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

259
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,945
How was Florida?

260
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:04,447
You had sex, didn't you?

261
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,366
How do you do that?

262
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:12,288
- So, who?
- You know Paul?

263
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,415
Paul, the wine guy?

264
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,167
Oh, yeah, I know Paul.

265
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:21,214
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

266
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:23,716
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

267
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:28,012
Before me, there was no snap
in his turtle for two years.

268
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:33,810
Of course it was a line.

269
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:36,896
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

270
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:40,358
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than:

271
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,443
"To get you into bed. "

272
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:45,071
Is it me?

273
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:48,783
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs...

274
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,577
and men with severe emotional
problems can hear?

275
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:53,704
All right, come here. Give me your feet.

276
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,047
I just thought he was nice, you know?

277
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:08,386
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

278
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:14,308
Guess what.

279
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,269
- You got a job?
- Are you kidding?

280
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:18,104
I'm trained for nothing.

281
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,983
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.

282
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:23,693
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

283
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,405
Well, you would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale...

284
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,323
50 percent off.

285
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:31,325
Oh, how well you know me.

286
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:35,413
They're my new "I don't need
a job or my parents.

287
00:18:35,664 --> 00:18:37,832
I've got great boots" boots.

288
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:41,419
- How'd you pay for them?
- Uh, credit card.

289
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,629
And who pays for that?

290
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:46,382
Um, my father.

291
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:51,137
You can't live off your parents
your whole life.

292
00:18:51,346 --> 00:18:55,016
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

293
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:58,394
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

294
00:18:58,562 --> 00:19:00,062
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

295
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,940
I remember when I first came
to this city, I was 14.

296
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,985
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was back in prison.

297
00:19:06,153 --> 00:19:08,196
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

298
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:11,741
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields...

299
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:15,703
outside Port Authority.
And then he killed himself.

300
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:20,291
And then I found aromatherapy.
So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

301
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:27,173
The word you're looking for is:

302
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:29,008
"Anyway... "

303
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,305
All right. You ready?

304
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,182
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.

305
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:37,934
Cut. Cut.

306
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,103
Cut, cut, cut.

307
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:45,650
- Hey.
- All right.

308
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,610
Welcome to the real world.

309
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,571
It sucks. You're gonna love it.

310
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,831
Well, that's it.
You gonna crash on the couch?

311
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,377
- No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

312
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,045
Yeah.

313
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:08,965
Look what I just found on the floor.

314
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,510
What?

315
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,470
That's Paul's watch.

316
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:16,722
You can just put it back
where you found it.

317
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,811
Oh, boy. All right.
Good night, everybody.

318
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,020
Good night.

319
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,197
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

320
00:20:34,324 --> 00:20:35,574
- Oh, sorry.
- No. Oh, no. Go.

321
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:37,702
- No, have it, really.
- Split it?

322
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,870
- Okay.
- Okay.

323
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,832
Thanks.

324
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:47,128
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had...

325
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:49,130
a major crush on you.

326
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,757
I knew.

327
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,385
You did? Oh.

328
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:58,180
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

329
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:00,933
- I did.
- Oh.

330
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,398
Listen, do you think...

331
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,068
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

332
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:17,033
Do you think it would be okay if
I ask you out sometime, maybe?

333
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:20,119
Yeah.

334
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,871
Maybe.

335
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,707
Okay.

336
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:31,922
Okay, maybe I will.

337
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:38,012
- Good night.
- Good night.

338
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:53,277
See you.

339
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,820
Mm-hm.

00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:57,406
Wait, wait. Hey, what's with you?

341
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,370
I just grabbed a spoon.

342
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,004
Can't believe what I'm hearing.

343
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:13,923
I can't believe
What I'm hearing here

344
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:16,300
- What? I said you had...
- What? I said you had...

345
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,804
- Would you stop?
- Oh, was I doing it again?

346

Yes.

347
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:24,892
Would anybody like more coffee?

348
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,230
Did you make it or are you just serving it?

349
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:32,691
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

350
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,402
Kids, new dream.

351
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:38,489
