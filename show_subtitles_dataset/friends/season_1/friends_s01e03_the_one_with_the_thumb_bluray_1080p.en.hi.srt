- Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:22,615
I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

You know I'm gonna be doing that

Fantastic. I have one question:
How is that possible?

- Alan.
- He was unbelievable.

182
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:14,872
He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs is playing all the positions.

But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan.

Do you ever think that Alan
is maybe sometimes-

- What?
- I don't know. A little too Alan?

Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too Alan.

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,952
Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness
that we adore.

192
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:51,496
- L, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
- Oh!

Yes, but I left in the Y's.

No, because you need that.
No, it's okay. Thanks.

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,942
I just can't stand your friends.

340
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:42,503
Remember when we went
to Central Park and rented boats?

341
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:46,290
That was fun.

342
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:50,382
Yeah. He could row like a Viking.

343
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:57,217
- Hi.
GROUP: Hi.

344
00:21:59,178 --> 00:22:01,055
So how'd it go?

345
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:05,063
- You know.
- Did he mention us?

346
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:13,075
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

347
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,957
ROSS:
You had a rough day, huh?

348
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:23,957
- Oh, you have no idea.
ROSS: Come here.

349
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,879
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
GROUP: No, no, no.

350
00:22:30,084 --> 00:22:31,336
I don't care. I don't care.

351
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:34,672
Game's over. I'm weak. I've gotta smoke.
I've gotta have the smoke.

352
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,474
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

353
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:40,139
Yeah, all right.
