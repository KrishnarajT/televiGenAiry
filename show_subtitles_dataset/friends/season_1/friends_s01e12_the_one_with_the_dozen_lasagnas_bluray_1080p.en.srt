1
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,320
No, we're done.
We're done, man.

2
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,000
Aunt Silv, stop yelling.

3
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,239
All I'm saying is, if you had
told me vegetarian lasagna,

4
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,760
I would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

5
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,239
The meat's only every third layer.
Maybe you could scrape.

6
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,079
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

7
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,640
Yep. You could plunk me down in
the middle of any woman's uterus,

8
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,680
no compass,

9
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,599
and I could find
my way out like that.

10
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,360
This is cool.

11
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,680
It says in some parts of the world
people actually eat the placenta.

12
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,240
And we're done with the yogurt.

13
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Sorry.

14
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,159
Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,120
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

16
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,280
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

17
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
You kiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
Ross, listen.

19
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,840
Do you know that right now
your baby is only this big?

20
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,439
This is your baby.

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,319
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello.

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,800
How come
you don't live with Mommy?

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,240
How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,759
What's a lesbian?

25
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,000
Honey, you can say it.
It's Poconos.

26
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
It's like "poke a nose."

27
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,039
Poke a nose.

28
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,840
- So did I hear "Poconos"?
- Yes.

29
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,159
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

30
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,719
First weekend away together.

31
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,120
- Yeah, it's a big step.
- I know.

32
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,599
It's just a weekend. Big deal.

33
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,479
Wasn't this supposed to be
just a fling?

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,120
Shouldn't it be flung by now?

35
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,039
We are way past the "fling" thing.

36
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,840
I'm feeling things I've only read
about in Danielle Steel books.

37
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,919
When I'm with him,
I'm just totally, totally…

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,560
Nauseous.
I'm physically nauseous.

39
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,680
What am I supposed to do?
Call Immigration?

40
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,520
I could call Immigration.

41
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,360
I love babies
with their little baby shoes,

42
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,479
and their little baby toes
and their little hands…

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Okay,
you're gonna have to stop that

44
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,839
forever.

45
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,279
Need a new table.

46
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,040
You think?

47
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,360
- Come on in.
- Hey. Hello.

48
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,000
I brought the books,

49
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,480
and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

50
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,959
Great.

51
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,319
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

52
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,959
I'm pretty sure that it is. Yeah.

53
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,399
So I got the results
of the amnio today.

54
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,399
- Tell me. Is everything?
- Totally and completely healthy.

55
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,879
That's great.
That is great.

56
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,399
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

57
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,759
That's our friend Tanya.

58
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,240
Of course it's your friend Tanya.

59
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,839
Don't you wanna know
about the sex?

60
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
The sex?

61
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,639
Yeah, I'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

62
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,199
But when you throw in Tanya…

63
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,920
The sex of the baby, Ross.

64
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,120
You know the sex of the baby?

65
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,319
- Do you want to know?
- No.

66
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,600
No, I don't want to know.
Absolutely not.

67
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,399
No, I think you shouldn't know until
you look down there,

68
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,360
and see, "There it is."

69
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,519
Or isn't.

70
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,519
- Hello, Ross.
- Susan.

71
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,160
So?

72
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,800
- So did you hear?
- Yes, we did. Everything's A-okay.

73
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,519
That's so cool.

74
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,240
It really is.

75
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,519
Do we know?

76
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,360
We certainly do.
It's going to be a…

77
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,000
Hello?

78
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,439
See, a guy who doesn't wanna know
standing right here.

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,360
Is it what
we thought it would be?

80
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,439
What?

81
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,639
Okay, what did we think it
was gonna be? No, no, no.

82
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,920
I don't want to know.
Don't want to know. Okay.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
I should probably just go.

84
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,319
- Thanks for the books.
- No problem. Okay.

85
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,839
Susan.

86
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,199
All right, who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

87
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Hello?

88
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,399
<i>Never mind.
I don't wanna know.</i>

89
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,639
Okay, so just because it was
my table, I have to buy a new one?

90
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,319
That's the rule.

91
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,720
What rule? There's no rule.
If anything, you owe me a table.

92
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,319
How did you get there?

93
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,279
I believe this piece of furniture
was fine

94
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,879
until your little breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

95
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
You knew about that?

96
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,480
The impressions you made
in the butter,

97
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,360
left little to the imagination.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,639
Okay. How about if we split it?

99
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
What do you mean, like,
buy it together?

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,120
Yeah.

101
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,240
Do you think we're ready
for something like that?

102
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,399
- Why not?
- It's just a big commitment.

103
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,839
What if one of us
wants to move out?

104
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,240
- Why, are you moving out?
- I'm not moving out.

105
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,120
You'd tell me if you were
moving out, right?

106
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,800
Yes, it's just that,
with my last roommate…

107
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,839
I know all about Kip.

108
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,079
We bought a hibachi together,
and then he ran off and got married,

109
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
and things got pretty ugly.

110
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,519
So let me ask you something.

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,399
Was Kip
a better roommate than me?

112
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,680
Don't do that.

113
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,759
You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

114
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,199
Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

115
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,240
And Ms. Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

116
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,639
Okay. Thanks.

117
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,759
Here comes your 3:00.

118
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,480
I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but, yum.

119
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,240
Paolo. Hi.
What are you doing here?

120
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,200
Rachella tell me you

121
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,639
massage?

122
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,200
Yeah, well, Rachella's right.
Yeah.

123
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,919
Okay, I don't know what
you just said, so let's just start.

124
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,399
I am

125
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,559
being naked?

126
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,919
That's really your decision.
Some people prefer to take off…

127
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,639
Being naked.

128
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,159
I can't believe you don't want
to know. I could not know.

129
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,759
If the doctor knows, and Carol knows,
and Susan knows…

130
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,559
And Monica knows.

131
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,200
How could you?
I don't even know.

132
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,159
Carol called to thank me for
the lasagna. I asked. She told me.

133
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,559
So, what's it going to be?

134
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,559
Great.
Now he knows and I don't know.

135
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm sorry. I'm just excited
about being an aunt.

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,799
Or an uncle.

137
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,840
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey, Pheebs.

138
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,279
Fine.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
- Phoebe, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.

140
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm just… I'm out of sorts.

141
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Can we get
some cappuccino over here?

142
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,399
Right. That's me.

143
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,919
Hey, Chandler. That table place
closes at 7. Come on.

144
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,039
Fine.

145
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,279
Phoebe. What is it?

146
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,000
- You know Paolo?
- I'm familiar with his work, yes.

147
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,519
Look, he made a move on me.

148
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,480
- The store will be open tomorrow.
- More coffee over here, please.

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,799
What happened?

150
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,639
He came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until…

151
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,440
- My God.
- Are you sure?

152
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,240
Yeah. I'm sure.

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,480
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

154
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,840
Was it?

155
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,240
Boy Scouts
could've camped under there.

156
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,840
Ooh.

157
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,879
- "Ooh," what?
- Ma Thurman.

158
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,879
- The actress.
- Uma Thurman!

159
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,000
Thanks, Rach.

160
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,320
- What are you gonna you do?
- You have to tell her.

161
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,120
You have to tell her. It's your moral
obligation as a friend,

162
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,519
as a woman. I think it's
a feminist issue. Guys?

163
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,919
- Yeah, you have to tell her.
- Feminist issue? That's where I went.

164
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,639
- She is gonna hate me.
- Yeah, well.

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,399
Will you pick one? Just pick one.
Here, how about that one?

166
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,039
That's patio furniture.

167
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,960
So what? Like people are gonna come
in and think, "I'm outside again."

168
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,200
Fine.

169
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,240
What about the birds?

170
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,960
I don't know. Birds just don't say:
"Hello, sit here. Eat something."

171
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,600
You pick one.

172
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,080
How about the ladybugs?

173
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:57,120
So forget about the birds, but
big red insects suggest fine dining?

174
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,679
Fine. Do you want the birds?
Get the birds.

175
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,480
Not like that, I won't.

176
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,879
Kip would've liked the birds.

177
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,039
- Hey.
- Hi, Pheebs.

178
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,600
Are you moving out?

179
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,720
No, these aren't all
of my suitcases.

180
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,399
This one's Paolo's.

181
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,639
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

182
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,639
Sure. Just for a sec, though,
because Paolo's on his way over.

183
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,679
Okay.

184
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
Okay.

185
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
- Pheebs…
- Okay.

186
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,600
We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

187
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,320
And there are three things
that you should know about me.

188
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,759
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

189
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Two, I never lie.

190
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,159
And three, I make the best
oatmeal-raisin cookies in the world.

191
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,559
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

192
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,159
My God.

193
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,519
Why have I never tasted
these before?

194
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,919
I don't make them a lot,

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,279
because I don't think it's fair
to the other cookies.

196
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,720
God.

197
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,240
You're right. These are the best
oatmeal-raisin cookies I've ever had.

198
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,840
- Which proves that I never lie.
- I guess you don't.

199
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,519
Paolo made a pass at me.

200
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,519
So, what do you think?

201
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,840
I think it's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

202
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,399
I know.

203
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,480
So how does this work? Gonna balance
the plates on these little heads?

204
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,799
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink.
Come on.

205
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,399
Heads up, Ross.

206
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,399
Score! You suck.

207
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,639
Are you okay?

208
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,519
I need some milk.

209
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,080
I've got milk.

210
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,600
Here you go.

211
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,879
Better?

212
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,879
No.

213
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,600
I feel so stupid.

214
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,080
I think about the other day,
with you guys, you know.

215
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:40,240
And I was all, "Paolo. He's so great.
He makes me feel so…"

216
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,919
God.

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,639
I'm so embarrassed.

218
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,159
I'm the one he hit on.

219
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,360
I unleashed him on you.
If I'd never met him,

220
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,879
this would've never happened.

221
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,080
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

222
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,440
No, I'm sorry.

223
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,919
Wait.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,240
- What are we sorry about?
- I don't know.

225
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,360
Right. He's the pig.

226
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,120
- Such a pig.
- Oh, God, he's such a pig.

227
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,720
- He's like a big disgusting pig…
- Yeah, like a…

228
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,960
- Pig man.
- Yes, good. Okay.

229
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,919
But he was my pig man.

230
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,600
How did I not see this?

231
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,440
I know!

232
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,360
Because…

233
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,480
He's gorgeous.

234
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,240
And he's charming.

235
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,919
- And when he looks at you…
- Okay. Okay, Pheebs.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,360
The end.

237
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,919
God.

238
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,759
Should I not have told you?

239
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
No, trust me,
it's much better that I know.

240
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,799
I just liked it better before.
It was better.

241
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,799
I think she took it pretty well.

242
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,559
Paolo's over there
right now, so…

243
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,919
Yeah, we should get over there
and see if she's okay.

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,840
Just one second.

245
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,960
- Score.
- Game. Us.

246
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,159
Yes.

247
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,919
Come on, Pheebs.

248
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,279
It looks like
we kicked your butts.

249
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,639
No, no. She kicked our butts.

250
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,159
You could be on the
Olympic "Standing There" team.

251
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,759
Come on. Two on one.

252
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,639
What are you still doing here?
She just broke up with the guy.

253
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,360
It's time for you to swoop in.

254
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,679
- What? Now?
- Yes. Now is when you swoop.

255
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,600
You gotta make sure
that when Paolo walks out,

256
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,399
the first guy Rachel sees is you.

257
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,960
She's got to know
that you're everything he's not.

258
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,080
You're like…
Like the anti-Paolo.

259
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,399
My Catholic friend is right.

260
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,120
She's distraught.
You're there for her.

261
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,360
You pick up the pieces,
and then you usher in:

262
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,919
The Age of Ross.

263
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,480
See this? See?

264
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,160
- How's it going?
- Don't stare.

265
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,680
She just finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

266
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,079
Now there's just a lot of gesturing
and arm-waving.

267
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,599
Okay, that is either, "How could
you?" Or "Enormous breasts."

268
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,920
Here he comes.

269
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,519
I am

270
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,440
to say goodbye.

271
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,559
Okay, bye-bye.

272
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,240
Paolo.

273
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,119
I really hate you
for what you did to Rachel.

274
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,440
But I still have five of these,

275
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,559
so heat it at 375
until the cheese bubbles.

276
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,920
Paolo, I just wanna tell you,

277
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,680
and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say…

278
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,359
Just look at her.

279
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,400
You guys, I really think only
one of us should go out there,

280
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,839
so she's not overwhelmed.

281
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,960
- Right.
- And I really think it should be me.

282
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,240
Hey.

283
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,279
You all right?

284
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,720
I've been better.

285
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,559
Come here.

286
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,519
Listen,
you deserve so much better than him.

287
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,000
You know? I mean, you…

288
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,160
You should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

289
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,759
- Ross…
- What?

290
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,440
I'm so sick of guys.

291
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,279
I don't want to look at another guy.

292
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,680
I don't want to think
about another guy.

293
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,759
I don't even want to be near
another guy.

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,920
Ross, you're so great.

295
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,519
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

296
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,279
Medium.

297
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,680
- Any cookies left?
- Yeah.

298
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,440
See, Rach…

299
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,839
I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

300
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
I really don't.

301
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,400
I think what you need is to develop a
more sophisticated screening process.

302
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
No. No. I just need
to be by myself for a while.

303
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,599
- I just gotta figure out what I want.
- No, no.

304
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,079
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

305
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,039
No, I know. I know.

306
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,680
And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

307
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:21,960
- What?
- What?

308
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm having a boy?

309
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,480
No.

310
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,279
No. In fact,
you're not having a boy.

311
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,599
I'm having a boy.

312
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,960
Am I having a boy?

313
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,039
You're having a boy.

314
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,640
- I'm having a boy.
- Yes!

315
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,880
- What?
- What is it?

316
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,160
I'm having a boy.

317
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,559
We already knew that.

318
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,279
I'm having a son.

319
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,759
Yes.
And that would be a shutdown.

320
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,000
Shutout!

321
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,920
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game.

322
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,119
- It's 2:30 in the morning.
- Yeah. Get out.

323
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,519
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

324
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,119
Come on,
I'll only use my left hand.

325
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,119
Come on, wussies.

326
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:31,440
All right. Okay. I gotta go.

327
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm going.

328
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,680
And I'm gone.

329
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,759
- One more game?
- Yeah.
