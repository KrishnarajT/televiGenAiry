It's not a big deal.

ROSS: Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

3

You just reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,638
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,389
As far as I'm concerned...

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,893

that comes close. Right?

Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.

8
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,565
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

9

Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,743
You just look down,
and there they are.

12

How you get any work done
is beyond me.

13
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,501
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things...

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,127
and then not even care.

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,136

- Not a one.

00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,538
Not even, say,
breaking up with Janice?

20

Oh, right, right. Shut up.

21
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,670
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

22

- You just gotta do it.
- I know. But it's just so hard.

23

You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,430
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

25
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,975
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

26

Why do you have to break up with her?

27

Be a man. Just stop calling.

If you want, I'll do it with you.

29

we were ganging up on her.

I mean you break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

31

You're breaking up with Tony?

I know. He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

his hunger strike. I don't know.

Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty,
chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that...

36

Nothing. I'm fine.

What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

38
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,273
It's my father. He wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

That guy, he burns me up.

40
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,989
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

41
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,159
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady."

42
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,787
Ooh, I hate when my father
calls me that.

43
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,166
Did he give you that whole
"You're not up to this" thing again?

44

version with three choruses of:

- Me.

Yes.

That's the important part.

346
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,788
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

347
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,879
Whoa, I'm sorry.

348
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,631
Excuse me. We had this cart.

349
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,051
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

350
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,554
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

351
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,433
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

352
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,685
Hey, hey, hey.
There aren't any clothes in it!

353
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,521
Hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

354
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,150
Let go! Come on, this is my cart.
You know I saw it first.

355
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,611
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart...

356
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,363
you're gonna have to
take me with it!

357
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,539
Yes! Did you see that?

358
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,999
You were incredible.

359
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,710
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,296
I could not have
done this without you.

361
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,887
ROSS:
Okay, um...

362
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,015
Uh... More clothes in the dryer?

363
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,394
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

364
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,400
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

365
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,694
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,159
What a neat idea. All your
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

367
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:10,954
MONICA:
Hi!

368
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,205
PHOEBE:
How'd it go?

369
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,456
Excellent!

370
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,961
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

371
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,547
What a beautiful story.

372
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,300
I'm fine, by the way.

373
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,885
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:29,305
- Where's Chandler?
- He needed some time to grieve.

375
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,808
CHANDLER:
I'm free! I'm free!

376
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,478
That ought to do it.

377
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,153
