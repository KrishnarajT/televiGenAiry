1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,000
- Tell him. Please tell him.
- Tell him.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,360
- Shut up.
- Tell me what?

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,719
- You won't even look at him.
- Oh, come on, tell me.

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,839
I could use another reason
why women won't look at me.

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,400
All right, all right, all right.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,400
Last night, I had a dream

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,879
that, you and I were…

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,679
Doing it on this table.

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,559
Excellent dream score.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,839
Why…
Why would you dream that?

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,079
More importantly, was I any good?

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,240
Well, you were pretty damned good.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,520
Interesting, because in my dreams,
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,039
Well, last night, you seemed to know
your way around the table.

15
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,600
I love it when we share.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,640
You okay there?

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,759
I can't believe you two had sex
in her dream.

18
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,359
I'm sorry.
It was a one-time thing.

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,680
I was very drunk, and
it was someone else's subconscious.

20
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,599
Hello, Rachel.

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,480
Get off.

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,640
Give me. Can you see me
operating a drill press?

23
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,159
I don't know.
What are you wearing?

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,360
Pheebs, why would you want
to operate a drill press?

25
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,840
Just for some short-term work.

26
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,319
You know, till I get back
some of my massage clients.

27
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,360
Pirates again?

28
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,960
No. Nothing like that.

29
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm just such a dummy.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,039
I taught this
"Massage Yourself at Home" workshop.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,919
And they are.

32
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,800
Hey, hey, Chan,
she could work for you.

33
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,560
Thanks, Joey.
That's a good idea.

34
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,599
What?
I could. I could do it. What is it?

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,719
Well, my secretary's gonna be out
for a couple of weeks.

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
She's having one
of her boobs reduced.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,560
It's a whole big boob story.

38
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,759
I could be a secretary.

39
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,520
Well, I don't know
if it's your kind of thing,

40
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,360
because,
it involves a lot of being normal…

41
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,039
For a large portion of the day.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,080
I could do that.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,639
- What are you playing with?
- It's my new beeper.

44
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,199
Why the hell does a paleontologist
need a beeper for?

45
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,000
Is it, like,
for dinosaur emergencies?

46
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,000
"Help, come quick!
They're still extinct!"

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,520
No, it's for when Carol goes
into labor.

48
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,000
She can get me wherever I am.

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,560
All she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.

50
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,840
A cool phone number
and a possible name for the kid.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,439
- I'll see you guys later.
- Off to see young Ethan?

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,439
Thank you.

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,439
How young is young Ethan? Young?

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,919
He's our age.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,879
When we were?

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,319
- Okay, he's a senior in college.
- College?

57
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,439
And this man-child has no problem
with how old you are?

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,879
No, of course not.

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,800
It's not even an issue…

60
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,759
because I told him I was 22.

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,159
- What?
- What?

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,879
- I can't pass for 22?
- Well, maybe 25, 26.

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,400
- I am 26.
- There you go.

64
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,360
Can you hear that?

65
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,520
Yeah.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,120
That'll stop
when you pick up the phone.

67
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,839
- Okay, I'm on.
- Okay.

68
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,079
Mr. Bing's office.

69
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:30,079
No, I'm sorry,
he's in a meeting right now.

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,879
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right…

71
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,600
Will he know
what this is in reference to?

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,399
And he has your number?

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,040
All right, I'll see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye.

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,319
- What?
- Ross says hi.

75
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,600
This is so fun.
All right, what do we do now?

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,639
Well, now
I actually have to get to work.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,240
"Most likely."

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,439
- Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
- Okay.

79
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,079
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,519
Yes?

81
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,199
What you doing?

82
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,680
Okay, windows are clean,
candles are lit.

83
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,879
Belt's too tight.
Gotta change the belt.

84
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,879
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made lasagna.

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,160
- Am I out of control?
- Just a touch.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,399
Mon, I don't understand.

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,319
I mean, you've been dating
this guy since, like, his midterms.

88
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,040
I mean,
why all of a sudden are you so?

89
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,560
What?

90
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,240
Could tonight be the night?

91
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,040
I don't know.

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,360
Look, he's a great guy, and I love
being with him, but, you know…

93
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:55,439
Things happen when they happen.
You don't plan these things.

94
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,920
- So did you shave your legs?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,040
Would you let it go, Ross?
It was just a dream.

96
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
It doesn't mean…

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,959
This is it. Oh, my God!
It's baby time. Baby time!

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,199
All right, relax, relax, just relax,
just relax. Be cool.

99
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,600
Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.

100
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,600
No, Andre is not here.
Third time today.

101
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Yes, I am sure.

102
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,759
No, sir, I do not perform
those kind of services.

103
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,360
Services? Oh, services.

104
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,360
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

105
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,040
Yeah.

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,680
That's right.

107
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,639
That's right. "JUMBO" with a U, sir.

108
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,480
No, you don't want me.

109
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,959
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,959
Yeah. Alrighty, bye-bye.

111
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,360
- Hey, hey. How was the first day?
- Hey.

112
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,920
Excellent.
Everyone was so, so nice.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,319
See? It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
Me.

115
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,519
I didn't tell anybody
that I knew you.

116
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,959
- Why not?
- Well, because, you know.

117
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,319
They don't like you.

118
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,879
- What?
- I thought you knew that.

119
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,120
Nah-uh.

120
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,680
- Who doesn't like me?
- Everyone.

121
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,480
Except for…

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,399
No. Everyone.

123
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,720
- What are you talking about?
- Don't feel bad.

124
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,240
You know,
they used to like you a lot.

125
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,839
But then you got promoted, and
now you're all, like, Mr. Boss-Man.

126
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,360
You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing.
Boss-Man Bing.

127
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,399
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah, yeah. They even do you.

128
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,959
- They do me?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,319
You know, like, okay:

130
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,879
"Could that report be any later?"

131
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
I don't sound like that.

132
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,480
- Chandler.
- Yeah, you do.

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,639
"The hills are alive with
the sound…

134
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,439
of music."

135
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,800
"My scone!"

136
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,360
"My scone!"

137
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,920
Okay, I don't sound like that.
That is so not true.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,720
That is so not…
That is so not… That…

139
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,120
Oh, shut up!

140
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,440
You did not.

141
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,480
I am telling you, up until I was 9…

142
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,360
I thought gunpoint was an actual
place where crimes happened.

143
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,039
How is that possible?

144
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,039
Think about it.
It's always on the news.

145
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,759
"A man is being held up
at Gunpoint."

146
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,240
"Tourists are being terrorized
at Gunpoint."

147
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,559
And I just kept thinking,
"Why do people continue to go there?"

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,480
- I should go.
- Okay.

149
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
Okay.

150
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,639
- Unless…
- What?

151
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,879
Unless you wanna stay over.

152
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,600
I mean, I'm going to. So…

153
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Yeah, I'd really like that.

154
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,600
Before we get into
any staying-over stuff,

155
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,960
there's something you should know.

156
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,519
Okay. Is this like
"I have an early class tomorrow"

157
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,159
or "I'm secretly married
to a goat"?

158
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,960
Well, it's somewhere in between.

159
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,200
You see, in a strictly technical
sense, of course, I'm not…

160
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,200
Well, I mean, I haven't ever…

161
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,080
- Ethan?
- Yeah?

162
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,519
Are you a virgin?

163
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,279
Well, if that's what you kids
are calling it these days,

164
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,840
then yes, I am.

165
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,000
I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.

166
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

167
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,559
You do know
I was talking about you, right?

168
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,000
You keep saying that.

169
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,039
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

170
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,879
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man…

171
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,559
It is nothing like that.

172
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,480
Listen, listen.

173
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,960
You told me something
that was really difficult for you.

174
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,960
And, well, I figure if you
can be honest, then I can too.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,799
- God, don't tell me I did it wrong.
- No.

176
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,440
No, no, no.

177
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,399
Nothing wrong about that.

178
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,559
Okay. Here goes.

179
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,919
I'm not 22.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm 25.

181
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,799
And 13 months.

182
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,200
But I figure, you know,
that shouldn't change anything.

183
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,559
I mean, what the hell does it matter
how old we are?

184
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,879
Listen…

185
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
as long as we're telling stuff

186
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,279
I have another one for you.

187
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,039
I'm a little younger than I said.

188
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,799
You're not a senior?

189
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm a senior.

190
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,440
In high school.

191
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,200
Okay.

192
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,360
What we did was wrong.

193
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,919
God. I just had sex with someone who
wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

194
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,879
I just had sex.

195
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,240
Ethan, focus.
How could you not tell me?

196
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,960
- You never told me how old you were.
- That's different.

197
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,159
My lie didn't make one of us a felon
in 48 states.

198
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,799
- What were you thinking?
- I wasn't. I was busy falling…

199
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,799
- Don't say it.
- … in love with you.

200
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,840
Really?

201
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,759
Sorry.

202
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,039
Well, fall out of it.

203
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,320
You know, you shouldn't even be here.
It's a school night.

204
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,240
Oh, God!

205
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,279
I'm like those women that you see
with shiny guys named Chad.

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,039
I'm Joan Collins.

207
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,320
Who?

208
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
Okay, Andre should be there
in about 45 minutes.

209
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,879
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

210
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,639
It's just easier that way.

211
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,799
Oh, come on.
You told me about the last dream.

212
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,679
No. Forget it.

213
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,360
Well, why not? Was I doing
something particularly saucy?

214
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,679
All right, fine.

215
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,559
Well, you were
not the only one there.

216
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,039
Joey was there too.

217
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,960
All right.

218
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,440
Was there…

219
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,720
…anybody else there?

220
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,879
- No.
- You sure?

221
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,000
Nobody, handing out mints
or anything?

222
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,200
No, it was just the three of us.

223
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,000
So tell me, was it like you and
Chandler and then you and me,

224
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,320
or you and me and Chandler?

225
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,360
- You know what?
- What?

226
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
There were times…

227
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,600
when it wasn't even me.

228
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,480
That is so sweet, you guys.

229
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,639
- Hey, Mon.
- Mon.

230
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,039
Mon, Ethan called again.

231
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,639
Mon?

232
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
Mon!

233
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,639
- What?
- Ethan called again.

234
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,200
- You're not seeing him anymore?
- No.

235
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,639
You know,
sometimes just things don't work out.

236
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,600
And this has nothing to do
with the fact

237
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,679
that he needs a note
to get out of gym?

238
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,639
I didn't say any…
I did not say anything, I swear.

239
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
He stopped by.

240
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,759
Next time you talk to him,

241
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,600
could you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

242
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,480
Oh, my life is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

243
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,679
Sorry. Sorry.

244
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,879
It's morphing time.

245
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,360
- Stegosaurus!
- Tyrannosaurus!

246
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,159
I gotta go.

247
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,120
Head rush.

248
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,399
One more and then I have to go.

249
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,799
Cool.

250
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,960
Where you going?

251
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,720
I got a birthday party
with some work people.

252
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,360
Work people?

253
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,240
- Nobody told me.
- No, I know.

254
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,159
That's part of the whole, you know,
them-not-liking-you extravaganza.

255
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,519
Know what? I don't get this. A month
ago, these people were my friends.

256
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,519
Just because I'm in charge,
doesn't mean I'm a different person.

257
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,399
Well, then you should come tonight,
just hang out with them.

258
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Let them see
what a great guy you still are.

259
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,679
- You think I should?
- I really do, yeah.

260
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,600
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

261
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,120
Oh, but, could we not go together?

262
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,039
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss, you know?

263
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,799
I think last night was great.

264
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,240
You know, the karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing "Ebony and Ivory"?

265
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,279
You were great.
But they still made fun of you.

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,320
What?

267
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,840
Now you're more like
Mr. Caring-Boss.

268
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,440
Mr. "I'm-One-of-You"-Boss.

269
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,159
Mr. "I-Wanna-Be-Your-Buddy"
Boss-Man-Bing.

270
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,200
Then I don't get it.

271
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,679
Well, you know what, Chandler?
I think you just gotta face it.

272
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,240
You're, like, the guy
in the big office, you know?

273
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,200
You're the one that hires them
and fires them.

274
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,960
- They still say you're a great boss.
- They do?

275
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,159
Uh-huh.

276
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,480
But they're not your friends anymore.

277
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,279
- But I just want to…
- No, but you can't.

278
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,519
But I just want…

279
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Aren't you gonna…

280
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,759
Carol and I have a new system.

281
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,519
If she punches in "911,"
it means she's having a baby.

282
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,799
- Otherwise, I just ignore it.
- What about Andre?

283
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,920
This morning he got a call from
what I think was our cousin Nathan.

284
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,559
And frankly, it was a little more
than I needed to know.

285
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,319
Hey.

286
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,319
That was gonna be my opener.

287
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,519
Hey, did you guys check out those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

288
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,160
- I thought that was just a rumor.
- True story.

289
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,039
All right, look,
I gotta tell you something.

290
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,240
I'm not 17.

291
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,960
I only said that so you'd think
I was cute and vulnerable.

292
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,319
I'm actually 30.

293
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,599
I have a wife. I have a job.
I'm your congressman.

294
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,200
Monica, this is ridiculous.
We are great together.

295
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,799
We can talk, we make each
other laugh. And the sex. Oh, man.

296
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay, I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.

297
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,920
- It was.
- Then what's the problem?

298
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,400
Ethan, it's…

299
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,359
It's icky.

300
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,039
Icky?

301
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,480
You're actually gonna throw this away
because it's icky?

302
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,839
Look, this isn't easy for me either.

303
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,519
I wish things were different.

304
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,400
If you were a few years older
or I was a few years younger

305
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,880
or we lived in biblical times…

306
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,440
- I could really…
- No, don't say it.

307
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,599
Love you.

308
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,200
- Are your hands still wet?
- They're moist.

309
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,240
- Yeah, right? Ahem.
- Let's dry them again.

310
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:53,319
Or, like, "Could these margaritas
be any stronger?"

311
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,200
- Hey, Chandler.
- Hello, Mr. Bing.

312
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:00,559
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

313
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,039
Thanks. Listen,
about the weekly numbers,

314
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:07,319
I'm gonna need them on my desk
by 9:00.

315
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,880
- Sure.
- No problem.

316
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,279
You have to give them something,
you know?

317
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,559
Okay, that was Gerston, Santos,
and who's the guy with the mustache?

318
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
- Petrie.
- Petrie. Right, right, okay.

319
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,400
Well, some people
are gonna be working…

320
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
this weekend.

321
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
That's nice!

322
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,559
Ross.

323
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,519
- Ross?
- I'm here.

324
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,799
You are?

325
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,160
We were just…

326
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,319
What?

327
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,079
Great. Now I'm having a baby.

328
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,839
What?

329
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,839
No. I'm having…
I'm having a baby!

330
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,279
- Oh, my God.
- I'm having a…

331
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,039
- The phone, the phone!
- The phone. I don't have the phone.

332
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,640
- Ross?
- I'm hurt.

333
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,880
Monica, let's go.
Come on, now, people. Woman in labor.

334
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,480
- Ross, look what I got going here.
- Yeah, save it for the cab, okay?

335
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,599
What are you doing?
We're going to a hospital.

336
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,839
What, so I can't look nice?
There might be doctors there.

337
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,079
- Joey, get out of the fridge.
- All right, all right.

338
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
- What is that?
- For the ride.

339
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,480
- Yeah, like in a cab you…
- Save it.

340
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,799
- Okay, hating this.
- Monica, come on, now. Let's go.

341
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,960
Baby coming. God.

342
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,160
I can't believe it.
I'm gonna be an aunt.

343
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,160
- Oh, that's…
