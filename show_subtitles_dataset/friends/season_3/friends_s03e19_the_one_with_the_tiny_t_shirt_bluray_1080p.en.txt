1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,519
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Say, Rachel,

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,359
<i>I was wondering if you'd like to go
to a movie with me sometime,</i>

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,919
as my lover.

5
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,559
Too out there.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,239
<i>Maybe you'd just like to get
something to eat with me sometime,</i>

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,480
as my lover.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,640
- Hi.
- Hi!

9
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,280
All right.
Let's go shopping.

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,039
You know, before we go, uh,
there's something I need to say.

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,479
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,960
I've kind of had
this crush on you.

13
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,000
But since you were with Ross,
I didn't do anything about it.

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,799
But now that you're not, I'd really
like to ask you out sometime.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,159
So that's what I'm doing now.

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,480
I dropped a cup.

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,000
So that's why within a few years,
that voice recognition

18
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,439
is going to be pretty much standard
on any computer you buy.

19
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,959
You know, so you can be, like,
"Wash my car," "clean my room."

20
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,079
It's not going to be able
to do any of those things

21
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,919
but it will understand
what you're saying.

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,319
- Oh, this was so great.
- Yeah, it was.

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,960
All right, then.

24
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,439
Bye.

25
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,439
Hello, people who
do not live here.

26
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,560
- Hi.
- Hello.

27
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,919
I gave you a key
for emergencies.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,919
We were out of Doritos.

29
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,280
Hey, how'd the date
go with Mr. Millionaire?

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,240
"Mr. Millionaire, new,
from Snooty Playthings.

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,039
Third wife sold separately."

32
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,759
He's great. I mean, we have
such a good time together.

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,639
He's so funny and so sweet,
and I'm not attracted to him at all.

34
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,919
- Still?
- No!

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,719
It's driving me crazy. In every other
way, he's like the perfect guy.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,479
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.

37
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,400
Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers
from Sharper Image?

38
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,759
Two.

39
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,360
Can Joey and I
put them on and fight?

40
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,719
<i>Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy!</i>

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,159
<i>Oh, Mommy! Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy!</i>

42
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,319
I guess he must have gotten
the part in that play.

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,360
Either that,
or Gloria Estefan was right.

44
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,639
Eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.

45
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,800
- Joe, how's it going?
- Good.

46
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,840
- Hey.
- Hi.

47
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,400
So you're playing Adrienne, huh?

48
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,840
Yes. Are you one
of the retarded cousins?

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,639
No, no. I'm playing your husband,
Victor. I'm Joey Tribbiani.

50
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,759
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Kate Miller.

51
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,080
So, play's pretty great, huh?

52
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,719
Oh, yeah. I love
Jennifer Banberry's work.

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
She's so brilliantly incisive

54
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,839
when it comes to deconstructing
the psyche of the middle class.

55
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,720
Oh, forget about it.
She rocks.

56
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,439
Where do I know you from?

57
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,000
Dr. Drake Ramoray?

58
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,680
"Days of our Lives"?

59
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,319
Voted most datable neurosurgeon
by "Teen Beat"?

60
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,399
No, that's not it.

61
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
So you're a soap actor.

62
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,360
Well, this must be exciting for you,
being in a real play.

63
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:47,040
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.

64
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,519
That infomercial…

65
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,480
for the milk carton
spout thing.

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,279
You're the guy who doesn't
know how to pour milk.

67
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,199
I actually can pour milk. But I got
you believing that I couldn't.

68
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,600
Now, see, that's acting.

69
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,959
Right, and at the end,
you choked on a cookie.

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,759
Yeah, that was real.

71
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,759
- I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
- I know.

72
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,639
Well, so, what are
you going to tell him?

73
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,519
I told him I would think about it,
but I'm going to tell him no.

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,600
I mean, I think I'd say no
to anybody right now.

75
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,720
Oh, but it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there

76
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
with this charming, cute guy
who's asking me to go out with him,

77
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,839
which I am
allowed to do

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,920
and I felt guilty, you know, like
I'd be cheating on Ross or something.

79
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,680
So, okay, maybe that means

80
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,439
that you're not over Ross yet
and you have issues with your father.

81
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,920
I don't have any issues
with my father.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,959
Okay, so it's probably
just the Ross thing then.

83
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,040
I hate this woman.
I hate her!

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,879
She told everyone in the company
about that infomercial,

85
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,040
and now they all keep asking
me to open their drinks.

86
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,199
Okay? And whenever I can't do it,
they're all, like, laughing at me.

87
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,480
- Hello.
- Hey!

88
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,360
So Rachel called.

89
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,959
Wants to see me.

90
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,720
Going over in a minute.

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,199
What do you think she wants?

92
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,720
Maybe the crazy fog
has lifted,

93
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,920
and she realizes that life
without me sucks.

94
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,879
It's possible. You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm just trying
to be supportive.

96
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,480
Well, be supportive
like a guy.

97
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,720
If I broke up with you,
I'd miss you.

98
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,959
You wanted to see me?

100
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,879
Yeah.

101
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,360
Here's a box of your stuff.

102
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,040
What?

103
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,439
It's just, like, hats
and a shirt and CD's.

104
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,759
Just sort of stuff
that you've left here.

105
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,720
What are you doing? Are you trying
to hurt me or something?

106
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,079
No.

107
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,519
Ross, it…

108
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,720
It just seems that, you know,
it's time we, you know, move on.

109
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,160
I mean, don't you think?

110
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,600
- Yes.
- Yeah.

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,279
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

112
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,279
Yeah, I really do.

113
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,079
Hey!

114
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,040
This was a gift.

115
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,920
Ross, you got that for free
from the museum gift shop.

116
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,160
It's still a gift.

117
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,560
I got it from the gift shop.

118
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,439
Okay. All right. Give me the mug.
I'll keep the mug.

119
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,399
No! You know, don't do me
any favors. In fact, where…

120
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,639
Where's the rest of my stuff?
Like, like…

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
This book is mine!

122
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,160
And that T-shirt you sleep in.

123
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,279
I'd like that back, too.
Yes, I do.

124
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,240
You know how much
I love that T-shirt.

125
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,319
You never even wear
that T-shirt.

126
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,480
I'm just trying to help
you move on.

127
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,800
Oh, you are a petty man.

128
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:23,959
You are a petty, petty…

129
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,560
- Petty…
- Petty, petty…

130
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,759
- Small…
- Petty, small…

131
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,919
You are so just doing
this out of spite.

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,840
No, no, no.

133
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,840
I'm going to wear this all
the time. I love this shirt.

134
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,440
You have not worn that since
you were 15.

135
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,360
It doesn't even fit you anymore.

136
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,759
Yeah, yeah.

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,120
Okay.

138
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,120
Now, if you don't mind, I'm going
to take the rest of my stuff,

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,159
and relax…
in my favorite shirt.

140
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
You have a pleasant evening.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,720
So, you're, like, a zillionaire.

142
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,679
And you're our age.
You're our age.

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,919
You know what?
You should, like, buy a state,

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,240
and then just name
it after yourself.

145
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,039
What, like, "Pete Dakota"?

146
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,320
Or "Mississi-Pete."

147
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,960
I got it.
"Pete Chicago."

148
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,399
That's not a state, Joe.

149
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,120
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?

150
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
I got to go.
So I'll see you guys later.

151
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,720
- Okay. You're our age.
- Okay.

152
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,639
So, are we on
for tomorrow?

153
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
Absolutely.

154
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,960
Now get out
of here, you.

155
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,720
Okay, I'm running out of
places I can touch him.

156
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,039
I mean, is there
something wrong with me?

157
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,879
I mean, why am I only attracted
to guys where there's no future?

158
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,399
Either they're too old
or they're too young.

159
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,639
And then there's Pete,
he's crazy about me,

160
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,240
and he's absolutely perfect,
and there's, like, zip going on.

161
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,679
Seriously. Does it sound like
there's something wrong with me?

162
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,399
Yeah. Kind of.

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Happy? Is that what
I'm supposed to be, Vic?

164
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,519
Happy?

165
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,120
Well, why don't you tell me
what you're supposed to be, huh?

166
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,639
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.

167
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
I talk to you,
and nothing.

168
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,480
You look at me,
and it's nothing.

169
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,679
Nothing.

170
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,320
Tasty.

171
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,080
I'm really starting to feel like
you guys have a history. It's nice.

172
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,440
- I have a question about this scene.
- Yes.

173
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,840
Well, I don't understand why
Adrienne's attracted to Victor.

174
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,279
Peel the onion.

175
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,559
First of all,
he's good-looking.

176
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,240
Yeah.

177
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,279
I think my character's going to need
a bit more of a reason than that.

178
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,399
Oh, hey, how about this one…
It says so in the script!

179
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,279
You know, I don't know why
my character likes you either.

180
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,159
I mean, it says in the script
here that you're a bitch.

181
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:32,440
- It doesn't say that in the script.
- It does in mine.

182
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,759
I can blow dry it. I can put
gel on it. It doesn't matter.

183
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,639
I still wind up with this
little cowlicky thing

184
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,240
on the middle part of my head.
It's so annoying.

185
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,159
- Does it bug you?
- You bug me.

186
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,759
Is there any chance
you didn't see that?

187
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Ross, you got
to stop, okay?

188
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,240
Ross, you can't just stare through
the peephole for three hours.

189
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,399
You're going to
get peep eye.

190
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,240
I knew it. I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.

191
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,639
She'd say no, but
here we are, right?

192
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,159
We just broke up,
first thing she does…

193
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,840
You didn't just break up.

194
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,879
Hey, it's been,
like, three weeks.

195
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,279
You slept with somebody three hours
after you thought you broke up.

196
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,080
I mean, bullets have
left guns slower.

197
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,679
Here they come.

198
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,480
If she kisses him good night,
I'm going to kill myself, I swear.

199
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,440
I can't watch…

200
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,120
Come on. Date over.
Date over.

201
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,679
- Oh, oh. Here we go. She's going in.
- Okay.

202
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,279
She's going in.
Wait. He's going in.

203
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,759
He's going in.

204
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,440
The door's closed. I can't see
anything with the door closed.

205
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,279
And the inventor of the door
rests happily in his grave.

206
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,200
Okay, I have to do something.
I mean, I have to stop it.

207
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,879
- Stop what?
- I don't know.

208
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,000
But I have a feeling
that my being there will do it.

209
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,600
I'll go over and
I will borrow something.

210
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,440
- Juice. I need juice.
- No.

211
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,720
- You can't.
- A little help.

212
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,759
- Look, they must be stopped.
- I am your friend.

213
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,720
And I am not going
to let you do this.

214
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
You are surprisingly strong.

215
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,559
- I need juice. People need juice!
- Look, man…

216
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:30,360
- People need juice! Juice!
- Listen to me.

217
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,360
She's moving on. If it's not this
guy, it's going to be somebody else.

218
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,720
And unless you're thinking about
subletting my peephole,

219
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,960
you are going to have to get
used to the fact

220
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,720
that the relationship is over.

221
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,879
Okay, man? It's over.

222
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,919
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

223
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,360
It's just I miss her so much.

224
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
I know.

225
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,480
Why do all your coffee mugs
have numbers on the bottom?

226
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,600
Oh, that's so Monica
can keep track.

227
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,279
That way, if one of them is missing,

228
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,159
she can be,
like, "Where's number 27?"

229
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,080
You know what?

230
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,639
No, and I don't think
I'm going to want to.

231
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,279
I can't do this.

232
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,679
Yep. Yep, that's what
I didn't want to know.

233
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,519
Yeah. Mark, I'm just doing this
for the wrong reasons, you know?

234
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,200
I'm just doing it
to get back at Ross.

235
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm sorry.
It's not very fair to you.

236
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,360
Fair, shmair,
you know?

237
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,159
Look, you want to get back at Ross,
I am here for you.

238
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,919
Really.

239
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,720
No, no. I say we get back at him
right here on this couch. Right here.

240
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,440
Oh, God.

241
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm sorry about this.

242
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,200
That's okay.

243
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,200
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

244
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:08,840
I can just go home and
get back at him by myself.

245
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,360
…poised to become
the penicillin of the 21st century.

246
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,320
And so today, this hospital
is about to take major steps

247
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,120
toward leading that revolution.

248
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,000
- It is truly ironic…
- Hey. Can I ask you something?

249
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,639
Where are we?

250
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,879
Well, with all these
doctors and nurses,

251
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,799
I'm going to say,
Midget Rodeo.

252
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,120
Just tell me the truth.

253
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,879
Okay.

254
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
I don't think I told you this,

255
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
but I just recently got out
of a really serious relationship.

256
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,919
Oh, right.
Wasn't that like a year ago?

257
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,480
So I did tell you.

258
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,360
Okay. Well, you know,
that's not really the thing.

259
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,360
The thing is, is that right now
I'm just in a place in my life

260
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,879
where I just need to focus on me.

261
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,720
- Do you know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah. I know.

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,240
- I so want to be attracted to you…
- But you're not. Okay. Good.

263
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,919
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,639
You know what? Don't be.
This is not…

265
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,679
Don't be,
'cause it's not so bad.

266
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,879
- It's not?
- Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.

267
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,519
Or someone you find attractive.

268
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,799
I'm just
think, you know,

269
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,200
that you might end up
feeling differently.

270
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,480
Well, look, I don't want
this to come out wrong,

271
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,279
but you seem awfully
confident for a guy

272
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,399
I just told I wasn't
attracted to.

273
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,919
Yeah. Stupidly
charming, isn't it?

274
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,759
Listen, you want to get
something to eat?

275
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,039
'Cause this place is
kind of dee-pressing.

276
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,840
And now the man who made all
this possible… Mr. Peter Becker.

277
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
One sec.

278
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,359
I don't think this town is big enough
for the both of us to relax in.

279
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,920
Draw.

280
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
I wasn't doing anything.

281
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,519
What did she do now?

282
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Just because she went
to Yale Drama,

283
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,519
she thinks she's, like,
the greatest actress

284
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,119
since sliced bread.

285
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,640
Sliced Bread,
a wonderful Lady Macbeth.

286
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,119
God, I hate her. I hate her
with her, "Oh, I'm so talented"

287
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,880
and "Oh, I'm so pretty,"
and "Oh, I smell so good."

288
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,279
I think somebody has
a crush on somebody.

289
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,039
Hey, Chandler, can we please try and
stay focused on my problem here?

290
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm talking about you,
you big, big freak.

291
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
You're out of your mind.

292
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,519
Hey, you have done nothing but
talk about her for the last 48 hours.

293
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,920
If you were in school yard,

294
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,279
you'd be pulling her pigtails
and pushing her down now.

295
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,799
Oh, yeah? Then how come
I keep thinking about her

296
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,519
in all these sexual scenarios
and stuff, huh?

297
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,759
Happy? Is that what I'm
supposed to be, Vic? Happy?

298
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,759
Well, why don't you tell me what
you're supposed to be, huh?

299
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,240
Because I sure as hell
can't figure it out.

300
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,759
I talk to you,
and it's nothing.

301
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,359
You look at me,
and nothing.

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Nothing.

303
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,000
You guys make me fly…

304
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,279
high.

305
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,119
Okay. We're going to
pick it up here tomorrow.

306
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,559
- Well, that was…
- Better?

307
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,119
Yeah, yeah. It was definitely

308
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,759
an improvement,

309
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,079
- Good night.
- Kate.

310
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,519
Yeah?

311
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:25,079
You forgot your shoes.

312
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,039
I'm probably going
to need those, huh?

313
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,359
- Okay.
- Hey, listen.

314
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,359
You feel like getting
a cup of coffee?

315
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
- Kate.
- Yeah.

316
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,839
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

317
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,400
Very nice. Very nice.

318
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,720
- See you tomorrow, huh?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

319
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,200
- Right.
- Good night.

320
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,039
Hey.

321
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,240
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?

322
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,039
You know, like
Goldman, Silverman?

323
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,079
'Cause it's not his last name.

324
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,519
- It isn't?
- No, it's not, like…

325
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,119
Like Phil Spiderman.

326
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,000
He's a spider… man.

327
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,200
You know, like
like Goldman is a last name.

328
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,480
But there's no gold-man.

329
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,960
Oh, okay.

330
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,599
There should be a Gold Man.

331
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,599
- Hey.
- Hey, Rach.

332
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,359
- How was work?
- Oh, great.

333
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,400
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

334
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,799
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

335
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,960
Well, I guess
I had that one coming.

336
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,960
I'm going to throw it out. It's
probably a bunch of shampoo and…

337
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,599
Something wrong?

338
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,240
No, nothing.

339
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,359
So, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?

340
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,599
Okay. Well, he would
turn things to gold.

341
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,079
What about things that are
already gold?

342
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,400
His work is done.

343
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,079
Okay. Let's play
my game now.

344
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,319
Okay.

345
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,279
Why, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered… draw!

346
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Yeah, it's fun.
