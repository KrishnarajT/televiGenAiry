348
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,675
You know, in my defense, um...

349
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,512
...there was no glitter on
the macaroni and very little glue.

350
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,516
And in my defense,
the cleaning lady came on to me.

351
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,979
- Do you have trouble telling time now?
- No.

352
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,940
- Quick, what time is it?
- Time to kiss a guy?

353
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,738
What are you laughing at, Pampers?

354
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,285
You know when I said
married people...

355
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,371
...should share everything
and not have any secrets?

356
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,458
- Yeah?
- That was stupid. Let's not do that.

Oh.

358
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,169
Absolutely.

359
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,465
We should keep the stuff we told
each other secret from everyone else.

CHANDLER: Ha, ha.
- Yeah, definitely.

361
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,011
Okay, ha, ha.

362
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,680
If you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna hang out with people...

363
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,350
...who don't know
the Space Mountain story.

364
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,854
- Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
- Man!

365
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,818
Not that you would, but I wouldn't
hang out with the guys at my office.

- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. What's up?

00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,506
I got asked out twice today
while I was at lunch...

- Really?
TAG: Yeah.

373
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,597
Did you tell someone that I was gay?

374
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,142
Oh, did you not want people
to know that?

375
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:16,190
I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't
want you to think I was gay.

376
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,276
Why is that?

377
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,698
- I don't think I should say.
- Oh, you can say.

378
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,203
Come on, I don't want you to feel
like you can't tell me things.

379
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,082
- Okay.
- Okay.
