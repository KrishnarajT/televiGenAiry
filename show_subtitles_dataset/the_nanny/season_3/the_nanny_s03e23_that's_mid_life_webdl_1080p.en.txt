1
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:05,314
Oh, my neck is killing me.

2
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:08,650
Who ever knew a tennis
match could be so strenuous?

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,519
Agassi's tush. Sampras's tush.

4
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:13,455
Agassi's tush. Sampras's tush.

5
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:15,858
Fran, you've never been
to a tournament before?

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,662
Well, a Mah Jong tournament.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,564
The only thing that
gets those tushes moving

8
00:00:20,632 --> 00:00:24,068
is to rip the cellophane
off the deli platter.

9
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,070
You know, I came here to
see some famous athletes.

10
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:28,672
Where's Monica Seles, Shaq, Joe Montana?

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,474
Brighton, just because they own the place

12
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:33,811
doesn't mean they're actually
gonna be here bussing tables.

13
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,912
Hi. I'm Monica Seles.

14
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:40,417
Welcome to the All Star Cafe.

15
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:44,822
Oh, my God, do you know who this is?

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,823
What am I, an idiot?

17
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:50,027
Honey, can I substitute slaw for beans?

18
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,862
Miss Fine, this woman has won

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,498
every single major tennis
tournament in the world.

20
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:58,402
Well, actually, Dad, I don't
think she's won Wimbledon.

21
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,038
You know what? I'll take her beans.

22
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:03,507
Oh, Miss Seles, I am so embarrassed.

23
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:06,476
I mean, I never expected you to be serving.

24
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:08,679
Oh, serving!

25
00:01:11,616 --> 00:01:14,618
I'll send your waiter right over.

26
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:18,188
You know, I have always wanted
to learn how to play tennis.

27
00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:19,556
What happened?

28
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:21,358
Well, it's a very big time commitment,

29
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:23,994
and I was always very career-oriented.

30
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:25,596
What happened?

31
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:28,699
You know, Fran, if you wanted,

32
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:29,933
I could teach you how to play tennis.

33
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,035
Oh, well, thanks, B,

34
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:32,336
but I kind of have my eye on that

35
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:34,905
cute blond instructor
at the end of the bar.

36
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:37,108
Am I not cute? Am I not blond?

37
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,276
Shut up, Maggie!

38
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:40,778
Sweetie, let's put it this way,

39
00:01:40,846 --> 00:01:44,948
if things don't work out between
me and gorgeous, I am all yours.

40
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:48,886
I'm all yours.

42
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:47,978
Oh, dear God.

43
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:49,213
Niles, please tell me you've cut out

44
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:50,581
all the reviews of my new play

45
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:53,650
because they're so good
you're having them framed.

46
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:57,254
Okay.

47
00:02:57,322 --> 00:03:01,124
Damn it! I was hoping
this show would be my Cats.

48
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:04,528
Oh, Niles, what's wrong with
me? I'm... I'm bloody pitiful.

49
00:03:04,596 --> 00:03:06,396
With all due respect, sir,
there are so many people

50
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:08,632
in this world less fortunate than you.

51
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,535
Some are in this very room.

52
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:13,371
Oh, you mean because you're just a servant.

53
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:14,605
Well...

54
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:17,708
No family, no home of your own.

55
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:22,512
No future.

56
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,383
Been doing the same thing
for the last 25 years

57
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:30,721
that you'll most likely be
doing till the day you die.

58
00:03:32,423 --> 00:03:34,791
Right. How are you feeling now, sir?

59
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:41,732
You know... you know
what's really bothering me?

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,834
Carrying around that big fat
wallet giving you a hernia?

61
00:03:46,137 --> 00:03:47,938
- What did you say?
- Tea?

62
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,877
Maxwell, did you read Vincent
Canby's review in the New York Times?

63
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,846
Oh, it was brutal.

64
00:03:55,914 --> 00:04:00,484
I just put it on the floor and let
Chester give him a little rebuttal.

65
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:02,686
C.C., you are amazing.

66
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:04,688
Thank you, Maxwell.

67
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,357
But don't you want to know why?

68
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:07,391
Why push?

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,329
Oh, hi. Hi, Chester.

70
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:15,199
Hi, sweetie. Hi.

71
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:18,668
Oh, gee,

72
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:21,371
Chester, if only you were Jewish

73
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,373
with a dog house in Great Neck.

74
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,777
C.C., we just put our heart and soul

75
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,979
into this new play, and it bombed.

76
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,413
Why aren't you more upset?

77
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:34,919
Because Broadway will be
dead in 50 years, but I won't.

78
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:39,556
Cryonic suspension.

79
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:42,593
Do you mean you're gonna have
your body frozen after you die?

80
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:45,596
Yep. I'm planning the ultimate revival.

81
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:46,663
Me.

82
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,499
Nobody wanted to see the original.

83
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:52,035
Who'd want to bring it back?

84
00:04:52,103 --> 00:04:53,770
I wouldn't want to come back.

85
00:04:53,838 --> 00:04:56,072
I mean, it would be so hard to adjust.

86
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,674
You'd feel like a freak of nature.

87
00:04:57,742 --> 00:04:59,242
You'd have no friends.

88
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,413
Your last date would
have been 100 years ago.

89
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:05,449
You know what? Go for it.

90
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:10,053
I'm even thinking of having Chester
frozen so we can come back together.

91
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,689
Wouldn't that be nice?

92
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,361
Come on, you little hairball.

93
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:22,499
You know, I should freeze myself right now.

94
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,101
I mean, here I am, 42 years old,

95
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:26,503
and what have I really achieved, hmm?

96
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:29,673
Produced one mediocre play after another.

97
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,942
Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself.

98
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,411
There's a lot of people
much less fortunate than you

99
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,180
right here in this room.

100
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:37,848
Look at Niles.

101
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,252
Hey, Dad.

102
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,222
So, are you off to another disastrous
day of tennis with Miss Fine?

103
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,490
Well, I can't today, but you know what?

104
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:49,026
She's actually pretty good.
She even taught me a few things.

105
00:05:49,093 --> 00:05:50,527
Like what?

106
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:54,130
How to return a serve when
you don't have the receipt?

107
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:57,100
- Oh, Brighton, come on, let's go play tennis.
- Oh, sorry, Fran.

108
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:58,902
I gotta read To Kill a
Mockingbird by Friday.

109
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,137
Oh, Brighton, I have two words for you.

110
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:02,872
"Blockbuster Video."

111
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,144
Oh, to enhance the reading experience.

112
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:11,481
Perhaps you would like to go out

113
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:12,783
and play tennis with Miss Fine, sir.

114
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,317
Yeah.

115
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:17,221
Niles, the last thing I need right now

116
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:19,323
is a round of beginner's tennis.

117
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,857
Of course, sir,

118
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:23,293
you'd completely destroy and humiliate her,

119
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,163
making her feel like a
bigger loser than you are.

120
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:29,499
Get my racket.

121
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:32,769
So, Miss Fine, are you
ready to play with me?

122
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:36,039
You bet.

123
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,077
And when we're done, how
about a little tennis?

124
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,521
- Little big shot.
- So I won a tennis match...

125
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,323
- I had the sun in my eyes.
- ... who cares?

126
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,425
It was no fair.

127
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,094
We weren't even keeping score.

128
00:06:57,161 --> 00:06:59,629
I slaughtered him, six-four.

129
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:02,432
I creamed his little English tokhes.

130
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,536
Get out. You beat Dad at tennis?

131
00:07:05,603 --> 00:07:08,606
Oh, I'll tell you, I
felt so bad for the guy.

132
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:10,140
It was really sad.

133
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,609
He had this look on his face,

134
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,343
like when I'm eating Haagen-Dazs

135
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:15,445
and my spoon hits the cardboard.

136
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:18,849
Oh, this is bad.

137
00:07:18,917 --> 00:07:20,017
Perhaps he'd feel better

138
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,752
if I prepared his favorite soup.

139
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,520
Cream of English tokhes.

140
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:28,025
- Niles, have this restrung, would you?
- Absolutely, sir.

141
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,327
Is there anything else I can do for you?

142
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,795
Yes, you can make me some of that soup.

143
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:34,097
Oh, and you may use your own tokhes

144
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:37,634
because it's soon to be canned.

145
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,938
He's got no sense of humor.
That's why his comedy's a flop.

146
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:46,310
Niles, he is really going
over the deep end about this.

147
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:49,346
This must be some kind
of underlying problem.

148
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:51,548
And do you know what that is?

149
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:53,951
Daddy's inability to
cope with minor setbacks

150
00:07:54,018 --> 00:07:56,887
indicating a larger and
deeper emotional problem?

151
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:02,926
Well, there's no point in me
saying it 'cause she already did.

152
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:06,263
Well, look, obviously
he needs some therapy.

153
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:09,065
You know, maybe Dad
should get some therapy.

154
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:12,469
- It really hurts me to see him in pain.
- Yeah.

155
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:15,271
Hey, we wouldn't have to
go as a family or anything,

156
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,442
'cause, you know, I've got dates and stuff.

157
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,144
You people are dreaming
if you think you're gonna

158
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:21,945
be able to get Dad into therapy.

159
00:08:22,012 --> 00:08:24,748
Oh, I'll get him there.
And do you know how?

160
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,649
Under false pretenses by telling him

161
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,618
Dr. Bort needs to talk to him about me

162
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:31,855
when in reality the session's for him?

163
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:35,893
Well, there's no point in me
saying it 'cause she already did.

164
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:46,236
You know, I always thought
that I'd make a good therapist.

165
00:08:46,303 --> 00:08:48,071
Yes. Well, I guess you would...

166
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,773
Because I'm really a
good listener, you know,

167
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:53,676
and some people just can't
get a word in edgewise.

168
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:55,478
Yeah. That always seems to be...

169
00:08:55,546 --> 00:08:57,681
I mean, it takes a very sensitive person

170
00:08:57,683 --> 00:09:00,049
to know when someone needs to talk.

171
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:05,188
You know, when the doctor comes in,

172
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,391
you could chime in once in a while.

173
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,394
I'm terribly sorry.

174
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:13,563
Dr. Bort has been called away,
but her associate can see you.

175
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:15,665
Oh, but when will she be back?

176
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,235
I don't want some second-rate associate.

177
00:09:26,711 --> 00:09:29,546
Dr. Joyce Brothers.

178
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:32,182
I'm filling in for Dr.
Bort. I hope you don't mind.

179
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:33,917
Oh, who cares about that loser?

180
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:36,286
Was she ever on Hollywood Squares?

181
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:42,159
Oh, Dr. Brothers, I have
read every one of your books.

182
00:09:42,226 --> 00:09:44,494
The Language of Feeling.

183
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:46,529
That's David Viscott.

184
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:48,732
The Ten Stupid Things Women Do.

185
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,901
Laura Schlessinger.

186
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,736
You're Much Taller In Person.

187
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:54,238
Dr. Ruth.

188
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,540
Well, enough about you.

189
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,509
Tick-tock. Ka-ching. Ka-ching.

190
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:04,715
Now, the reason why I made this
appointment for Mr. Sheffield...

191
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:06,283
W... what? Wait a minute.

192
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:08,484
You mean you brought me
here under false pretenses?

193
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:11,955
You know, I told Gracie
that was a bad idea.

194
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:13,590
Oh, this is ridiculous.

195
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:16,293
- I don't need any bloody therapy.
- No, you don't.

196
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:19,305
Are you Maxwell Sheffield,
the Broadway producer?

197
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:20,186
Yes, that's right.

198
00:10:20,197 --> 00:10:22,732
Now, if you don't mind, I'm
a very busy man, so I'll...

199
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,467
I just loved your new show.

200
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:28,705
I thought the reviews were
completely off the mark.

201
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,975
Well, I suppose I could
stay for a little while.

202
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:35,846
Wow! You are good.

203
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:37,180
For your information,

204
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,750
I have written 10 bestsellers.

205
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:42,852
Let it go, Joyce.

206
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:50,160
Now, why are we here?

207
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:51,561
Well, the fact is, Dr. Brothers,

208
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:52,996
there's nothing wrong with me.

209
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:56,533
My... my last show
failed, so I've just been

210
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:58,768
in a little bit of a bad
mood lately. That's all.

211
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:00,670
A bad mood?

212
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:03,573
You have been biting everyone's
head off, left and right.

213
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:04,975
Watch this.

214
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:11,181
I sat on some Junior Mints
on your new suede chair.

215
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:14,183
You what?

216
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:16,586
Can you believe what I have to live with?

217
00:11:17,755 --> 00:11:19,856
Do you know what your problem is?

218
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:22,359
You don't know how it feels to fail

219
00:11:22,426 --> 00:11:24,694
at something you put so much effort into.

220
00:11:24,762 --> 00:11:26,129
Oh, yeah?

221
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:29,633
Well, you know that new suede
chair with the Junior Mint stain?

222
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,636
I tried to color in the
rest with brown Magic Marker.

223
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:38,275
A huge failure. Happy?

224
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:41,811
Look, I don't know why everyone wants
to make such an issue out of this.

225
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,447
The fact is I just have to come to grips

226
00:11:44,515 --> 00:11:47,117
with the fact that I am 42 years old,

227
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:50,320
and despite having every
opportunity money can buy,

228
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,989
my life has amounted to zip.

229
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:55,558
Oh, Mr. Sheffield. Let him go.

230
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:58,294
He's just going through
a little midlife crisis.

231
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:00,963
It's very common among men his age.

232
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:03,700
Oh, you know, I've read about that.

233
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:06,870
Next thing you know, he'll be
trying to prove his virility

234
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:10,974
in the arms of the next gorgeous
young thing to cross his path.

235
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,842
Out of my way, Joyce.

236
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:23,553
Oh, this book is fascinating.

237
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,856
It chronicles the stages
of your life by decades.

238
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:30,460
Look at this. "Women in their
30s often lie about their age."

239
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,029
Oh, I know so many women like that.

240
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:36,400
Here's me, the 20s.

241
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:41,638
Oh, Niles, how did you
handle midlife crisis

242
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:43,874
back when you were in your 40s?

243
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:49,345
I think I killed someone who
lied about being in their 20s.

244
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,551
You two are not going to believe this.

245
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:58,121
- I got a message on my answering machine.
- Oh, my God.

246
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,022
Crack the champagne.

247
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,161
I am so happy for you, dear.

248
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,865
Very funny, Mrs. Doubtfire.

249
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:13,336
Maxwell is quitting the theater.

250
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:17,274
Oh, he is a classic textbook case.

251
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:22,045
If Maxwell leaves the
theater, what am I gonna do?

252
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:25,348
Oh, you were born rich. Retire.

253
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,684
Go spend time with all your friends,

254
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,553
and when you come back,
you can lick the spoon.

255
00:13:34,258 --> 00:13:37,193
Oh, look, Dr. Brothers
said it'll probably pass.

256
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:41,531
I mean, at least it's not like when my
father went through his midlife crisis.

257
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,966
He wanted Ma to get into swinging.

258
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,802
What happened?

259
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,804
Well, the other swingers saw them.

260
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:51,374
Fran, Fran, you gotta hide me, quick.

261
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:53,643
- What? What's wrong?
- Hey, Mags,

262
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:57,948
what do you say we hit Tower Records, hey?

263
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,116
Cruise the bins.

264
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:03,919
Fran, help me. Help me so much.

265
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:07,056
Mr. Sheffield,

266
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:09,692
Maggie cannot go to the record store

267
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,329
because I caught her smoking and drinking.

268
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:16,866
What? You are grounded for
three weeks, young lady.

269
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:18,602
Oh, thank you, Dad.

270
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,037
If he's not over this by then,

271
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:24,173
I'll tell him you're pregnant.

272
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:29,612
Maxwell, I'm only saying this
because I am thinking of you.

273
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,515
Why are you doing this to me?

274
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,017
C.C., life is short.

275
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:38,120
You should go back to doing
what you did when you were young.

276
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:42,024
Oh, sir, there's so little call
nowadays for Civil War nurses.

277
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:48,831
Miss Babcock, you're being so selfish.

278
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,504
I mean, this man is questioning
the very meaning of his life.

279
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:58,808
You died your gray streak?

280
00:14:58,876 --> 00:15:01,244
What the hell is wrong with you?

281
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:07,650
I happen to like it. I
think it takes 10 years off.

282
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:09,452
Catch you later, babe.

283
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,121
That was my gray streak.

284
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:14,057
I caused it, and it was mine to remove.

285
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,226
Were those Brighton's jeans?

286
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:20,129
Oh, I'll tell you, it is so pathetic

287
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:22,365
seeing someone trying to desperately

288
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,834
recapture their youth by dyeing their hair

289
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:28,104
and wearing skin-tight clothes.

290
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,273
Oh, you know, I shouldn't
be so hard on him.

291
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:33,709
I mean, who knows? Someday, the
same thing could happen to me.

292
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,689
Oh, Ma, you're on a diet?

293
00:15:46,757 --> 00:15:48,291
You can tell already?

294
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:52,495
Actually, your can gave it away.

295
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,697
Oh, thank you.

296
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,936
Have some, darling. It's delicious.

297
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:04,140
Mmm. What's in this?

298
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:08,845
You just add powder and some
non-fat milk and ice cream.

299
00:16:11,782 --> 00:16:14,550
Ice cubes, Ma.

300
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:17,653
The ice cream gives you a little body.

301
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:21,424
No, it doesn't.

302
00:16:25,896 --> 00:16:28,731
Ma, I need some advice.

303
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,134
Mr. Sheffield is going
through a midlife crisis,

304
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:33,403
and I don't know how to pull him out of it.

305
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:35,070
Marry him.

306
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,840
Well, how's that gonna help him?

307
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,310
Who cares? Better we should be happy.

308
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:46,683
Just be grateful that
he's not going through

309
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,719
what your father went through in the '70s.

310
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:51,588
Do you remember this?

311
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,496
That's Daddy's old Mod Squad toupee.

312
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:01,664
I can't believe you held onto it.

313
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:04,200
It's non-abrasive on Teflon.

314
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:09,438
Why's he going through
a midlife crisis, anyway?

315
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,975
I mean, just because he's over 40

316
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:15,444
and his play's a flop,
and I beat him at tennis.

317
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:16,579
What?

318
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:18,748
Have I taught you nothing?

319
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:23,787
You never beat a man at anything

320
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:25,621
until after you're married.

321
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:32,161
Is that how Daddy won that
pie-eating contest on your first date?

322
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:36,166
It wasn't easy. It was chocolate cream.

323
00:17:39,469 --> 00:17:43,006
Ma, what you did for love.

324
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:45,675
Miss Fine.

325
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:48,678
Oh, Mr. Sheffield?

326
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:51,213
Oh, my God. Ma, look at what he did.

327
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,049
He bought himself a Porsche.

328
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:56,119
Now, what does he think
that's gonna get him?

329
00:17:56,186 --> 00:18:00,189
Mrs. Feldman's daughter,
Mrs. Lieberman's daughter,

330
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:02,091
Mrs. Winetraub's daughter.

331
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,626
Hey, hey, hey.

332
00:18:03,694 --> 00:18:06,395
Ma, lower the fire escape. I'm going in.

333
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:11,334
Hi. I'm Dotty.

334
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:13,036
You new here in the building?

335
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:15,404
Oh, well, actually, I'm just...

336
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,474
I'm talking here, Vito.

337
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:22,211
My fiancé.

338
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,147
If you like me, I'll dump him.

339
00:18:25,716 --> 00:18:28,685
Are you stalled? Do you need a jump?

340
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,587
Hey! Hey! Hey!

341
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:33,290
If anybody's gonna jump
him, it's gonna be me.

342
00:18:33,357 --> 00:18:35,191
Keep moving.

343
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:36,893
Come on, you gold diggers.

344
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,796
Dotty, you're engaged.

345
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:43,666
Haven't you ever seen a single,
gorgeous millionaire before?

346
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:50,606
Louder, Fran, they
didn't hear you in Jersey.

347
00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:53,643
Mr. Sheffield, what
are you trying to prove?

348
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,045
I'm not trying to prove
anything, Miss Fine.

349
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:58,280
I'm just trying to enjoy
the rest of my life.

350
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:01,050
So I'm not successful. So what?

351
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:03,252
Everyone has a flop every now and again.

352
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,454
Even Andrew Lloyd Webber had...

353
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,357
Well, let's just get in the car.

354
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:09,559
Oh, what are you talking about?

355
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,828
You're the most successful person I know.

356
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:13,763
Miss Fine, you don't understand.

357
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:15,865
I had a privileged upbringing.

358
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:18,168
I should have achieved
much more than I did.

359
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:22,238
I wasn't brought up like you just
to find a husband and get married.

360
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:25,307
Well, finding a husband isn't all I want.

361
00:19:27,611 --> 00:19:29,846
Oh, come on, can we just move?

362
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:34,383
Because she's got a frozen lasagna
up there that could wipe us both out.

363
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:36,653
Look, all I'm saying
is that you didn't have

364
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,455
the same advantages that I had.

365
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:42,959
I... I was sent to the best
schools money could buy.

366
00:19:43,026 --> 00:19:44,336
Yeah. Well, meanwhile,

367
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:47,186
your parents sent you away
when you were six years old.

368
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:51,158
I mean, where were they when
you lost your first tooth?

369
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:52,526
Hi, how you doing?

370
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:55,062
On safari in South Africa.

371
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,064
But they sent me a Kruggerand

372
00:19:57,132 --> 00:19:58,633
to my headmaster to put under my pillow.

373
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:04,038
You know, how many times did you get

374
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:06,540
to run into your mother
and father's bedroom

375
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,876
when it was thunder and lightning out?

376
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:10,444
Well, I tried once.

377
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,514
But by the time I got
there, the storm had passed.

378
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,382
Very big house.

379
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,084
Sounds like I was the one

380
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:18,986
with the privileged upbringing.

381
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:23,057
I mean, I come from a very
close and loving family.

382
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,626
Am I bleeding?

383
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:28,862
I think it's just raspberry filling.

384
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,832
Hmm.

385
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,667
You know, a lot of people
with your kind of money

386
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,438
would have just sat back and
nightclubbed with the jet setters.

387
00:20:37,505 --> 00:20:39,373
That would have been my route.

388
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,876
But you went to work, mister.

389
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:45,846
You know, you're right.

390
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:49,850
- I... I came to this country all by myself.
- Yes, you did.

391
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:52,419
Started a very successful
business out of nothing.

392
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:54,788
Plus you raised three terrific kids

393
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:57,324
absolutely without any help from anyone.

394
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:59,026
Wait a minute.

395
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:00,761
It's true. It's true.

396
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:03,663
You know, I really haven't
done that badly at all,

397
00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:06,800
considering I was bloody
handicapped emotionally.

398
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:10,170
Please, you're completely dysfunctional.

399
00:21:11,773 --> 00:21:13,340
Feel better?

400
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:17,978
Yes. Yes, Miss Fine, as
a matter of fact, I do.

401
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,113
I feel a lot better.

402
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:21,982
Thank you very much.

403
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:31,525
Now, um, while I'm still
feeling a little bit impulsive,

404
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:34,361
what do you say, you and me,

405
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:36,464
one last hurrah?

406
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,500
Mr. Sheffield.

407
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:45,806
Isn't this thrilling, Miss Fine?

408
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:51,144
What a machine! Just feel it vibrate.

409
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:56,083
Yeah. But who can enjoy it?

410
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:58,352
I'm not really used to driving
on this side of the road,

411
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,521
so if I start drifting over,
just let me know. All right?

412
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:04,058
Okay. Drifting over! Drifting over!

413
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:10,264
All right. Let's really gun
it, huh? Hang on, Miss Fine.

414
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:16,303
Oh, God! Oh, God!

415
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,539
Wait! Wait!

416
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:28,982
I just had such a flashback
to my old boyfriend.
