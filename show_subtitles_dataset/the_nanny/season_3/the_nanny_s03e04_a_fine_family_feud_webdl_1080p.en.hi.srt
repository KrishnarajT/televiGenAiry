This is waht they call slightly irregular?

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,495
- Fran! Fran!
- Yeah, honey.

3
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:19,365
- Does it show yet?
- Wait a second.

4
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:21,875
What are you talking about? Does what show?

5
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:24,206
That I'll be sixteen next week.

6
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:26,044
Oh, oh, honey.

7
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:29,454
Gee, I felt just like my mother
when I told her I lost my virgin...

8
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:31,151
airline tickets.

9
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:33,521
What, did they give you another one?

10
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:35,515
Oh, no honey.

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,977
When you loose that ticket,

12
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,800
it's non-refundable.

13
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:42,085
Unless you get engaged to Prince Charles

14
00:00:42,077 --> 00:00:44,235
and then it miraculously reappears.

15
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:49,850
Oh Maggie, we gotta plan something
special for your sweet sixteen.

16
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:52,218
You know with my panache
and your father's checkbook

17
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:52,986
we could...

18
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:56,490
we could be two chicks ***.

19
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:59,406
Well, dad hasn't said
anything about my party,

20
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:01,494
all he does is pinch my cheek

21
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:04,106
and call me his almost-grown-up little girl.

22
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,101
With this lame grin.

23
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:08,525
Aww.

24
00:01:09,072 --> 00:01:10,511
There she is,

25
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,476
my almost-grown-up little girl!

26
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:16,174
I can't believe how big
you've gotten already.

27
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:17,918
You know, it only seems like yesterday

28
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:20,131
I was putting you on Mr. Potty.

29
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,111
Dad, you're making me vomit.

30
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:25,903
Do you remember our favorite game?

31
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,265
Here comes Mr. Snake.

32
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,985
Ooh! Hello.

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,309
That's funny. That was my ex-boyfriend
Danny's favorite game, too.

34
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:38,525
You know, dad, for Tiffany's sweet 16,

35
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:41,473
her dad flew all of her
friends to South Africa

36
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:43,694
and even got Whitney Houston to sing.

37
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:46,666
Ok, if Maggie gets a sweet
16, I'd like a bar mitzvah.

38

Brighton, you're not Jewish.

39

You know, a sizable
donation to Temple Emmanuel

40
00:01:51,383 --> 00:01:52,986
could take care of that.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,996

Now don't get offended, I don't

You don't like the new

00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,888
Fine. We'll replace them.

103
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:54,186
All right.

104
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:59,393
Now what?

105
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:03,353
Well, there is one other thing,
you know, besides the wallpaper.

106
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,243
Maggie hates the Guggenheim.

107
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:07,451
You're going to have to cancel. Bye.

108
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:09,885
W... wait! What are you talking about?

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,146
The Guggenheim's a perfect
place for the party.

110
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,567
Just picture it...

111
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:16,063

112
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,765
long white gloves,

00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,510
pink satin gown.

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,232
While Cathy adores a minuet,

115
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:23,921
a ballet russe, and crêpe suzette,

116
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:26,074
our Patty likes to rock 'n' roll.

117
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:30,266

come up with another idea.

118
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:33,556
Oh, well, you're so close!

119
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:37,048
Actually, I have to come
up with another idea.

120
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,200
She wants me to take over from here.

121
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,291
Maxwell, I bent over
backwards to get the museum.

122
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:44,259
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

123
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:49,977
All right, Miss Fine.

124
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,023
Let's just cut to the chase, shall we?

125
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:55,540
Where have you already decided
to have my daughter's party?

126
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:57,191
Tantuh Frieda's.

127
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:59,318
What on earth is a tantuh frito?

128
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:02,352
Not frito. Frieda.

129
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:06,044
My father's sister owns
a nightclub in Queens.

130
00:06:06,164 --> 00:06:09,078
Oh, well, that sounds...
dreadful, Miss Fine!

131
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,731
No. Actually, it's gorgeous.

132
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,421
It used to be a restaurant,
but it went out of business.

133
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:17,087
Whose bright idea it was
to open up a Tony Roma's

134
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:19,689
in a hasidic neighborhood I'll never know!

135
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:28,385
Oh, boy, does this bring back memories.

136
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:30,548
I used to hang out at this bar,

137
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,363
wear really short skirts and big,

138
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:37,981
teased-up hair and way too much makeup on.

139
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:42,060
Ah, well. Times change.

140
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:48,516
I would have given anything
to have my sweet 16 party here.

141
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,698
Why?

142
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,083
I mean, why didn't you?

143
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,873
Because my mother wouldn't let me.

144
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:58,977
She and Frieda had a big fight,
and they haven't talked since 1979.

145
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,810
That must be awful.

146
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:02,381
It's destroying them.

147
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:03,720
They both gained 40 pounds,

148
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:05,772
and they can't even rub
it in each other's faces.

149
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:09,138
Hello!

150
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,178
Watch this.

151
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,199
Health inspector!

152
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:15,608
Just one moment!

153
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:21,934
Here you go.

154
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:24,743
Franny! It's you!

155
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:26,414
Hi! Hi, aunt Frieda.

156
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,297
Mmm mmm mmmwah!

157
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,182
Oh, you must be Maggie.

158
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:33,409
You're too thin.

159
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:36,956
So how's your father?

160
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:39,447
Oh, he's great. So's ma.

161
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,674
Oh. She's still alive?

162
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,970
Be nice.

163
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,373
Maggie, you know, Aunt
Frieda's a celebrity.

164
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:48,507
She once sang on Merv Griffin's Show.

165
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:49,920
Don't embarrass me.

166
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,035
Twice.

167
00:07:53,656 --> 00:07:55,470
Now I work here.

168
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,060
When you're a woman alone,
you got to earn a living.

169
00:07:58,072 --> 00:07:59,931
Frieda buried four husbands.

170
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:02,959
The perpetual care alone
is enough to choke a horse.

171
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,868
At least I got them all in one plot,

172
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:08,546
so holy days... I'm in, I'm out.

173
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:15,033
So talk to me.

174
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:16,266
You like?

175
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:19,758
Uh, Fran, let's not completely
rule out the Guggenheim, ok?

176
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:24,819
Oh, honey, honey, I think
I can help you visualize.

177
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,259
I once worked here one
summer when I was 15.

178
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:29,218
Shh! I'll lose my license.

179
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,457
Frieda, if you didn't lose your license

180
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:34,278
for water bugs, I could double as bouncers.

181
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,940
[disco music plays] Oh, now I get it!

182
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,961
This is like one of those discos!

183
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,663
My party can be retro.

184
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,061
Hey, Fran, maybe we can even dress
up like they did in the olden days.

185
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,825
- Yeah!
- Did you save your stuff?

186
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:56,558
No, when I transferred from
the Pinta to the Santa Maria,

187
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:58,504
they lost my luggage.

188
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,416
Here. Here's a menu so you can plan.

189
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:05,742
Oh!

190
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:09,234
Aw, you don't have the Tony
Manera Marinara no more?

191
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:10,247
No.

192
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:14,326
Now it's the Ed Marinaro Marinara.

193
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:18,268
Damn butterflies!

194
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:25,306
Fran, if your mother and
your aunt don't get along,

195
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:27,452
won't she be upset you're
planning a party here?

196
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:31,394
Oh, honey, your sweet 16 has
nothing to do with my mother.

197
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:33,678
What could she possibly be upset about?

198
00:09:34,122 --> 00:09:37,007
Let me go, I want to die!

199
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:39,335
Ma!

200
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,631
No! You are not my daughter!

201
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:44,797
Well, then who gave me these
thighs so I can shoot them?

202
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:48,970
How could you do this to me?

203
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:52,173
Ma, you have nothing to do with this.

204
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:57,610
I have nothing to do with my
daughter's boss' daughter's sweet 16?

205
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:03,722
Fran, if you have the party
at Frieda's, I am not going!

206
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:06,544
Good, ma, 'cause you are not invited!

207
00:10:08,465 --> 00:10:10,036
Not invited?

208
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,383
You hear this, morty?

209
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:15,667
I'm not invited!

210
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:20,241
Your sister got me blackballed
like she did at Hadassah!

211
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:26,077
Ma, Frieda didn't get you blackballed.

212
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:27,818
They threw you out of Hadassah

213
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:31,152
because you donated cakes with
half the frosting licked off.

214
00:10:32,628 --> 00:10:35,718
I felt lightheaded in the car.

215
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:41,531
She has turned you against me.

216
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,765
I don't want to know from that woman.

217
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:46,380
Is she bigger than me?

218
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:48,314
Ma!

219
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,147
This isn't about you and Frieda.

220
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,192
It's about Maggie.

221
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,870
It's her party, and it's all about her.

222
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,202
- Fran...
- Butt out, honey.

223
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:59,731
Now this stupid fight has
already ruined my graduation

224
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:01,483
because I couldn't have it at Frieda's.

225
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:03,091
And it was still lovely.

226
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:04,993
We had it al dente.

227
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,425
That means outdoors.

228
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:10,292
Fran, that sounds sort of nice.

229
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:11,268
Oh, yeah?

230
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:14,508
We had it on Grandma Yetta's
roof of her old building.

231
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,124
Middle of June. 114 degrees.

232
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:20,714
People stayed all night.

233
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:23,342
That's because they were stuck to the tar!

234
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:28,941
Fran, I really want my party at Frieda's,

235
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,237
but not if it's gonna come
between you and your mom.

236
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:33,170
Huh?

237
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,893
Oh, I feel terrible. I'm being so selfish.

238
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:37,619
Yeah, well.

239
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,666
You're only 16 once.

240
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:40,985
Never mind me.

241
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,282
Have the party wherever you want.

242
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,478
Oh, ma,

243
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:48,300
you're just saying that to
try and make me feel guilty.

244
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,199
I'm not trying to make you feel anything.

245
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,912
Feel this. Is this a lump here?

246
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:07,431
Did you pick up Miss Margaret's
present for Mr. Sheffield?

247
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,819
No, I spent the entire day

248
00:12:09,849 --> 00:12:11,571
driving around Greenwich, Connecticut,

249
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:13,794
looking for that damn jewelry store.

250
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:15,421
Oh, did I say Greenwich, Connecticut?

251
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,747
I meant Greenwich Village.

252
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:21,877
That's 10 minutes away, you boob!

253
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:24,184
Well, you'd better hurry before they close.

254
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:25,946
Oh, this is ridiculous!

255
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:28,453
I don't know why that
stupid store doesn't deliver!

256
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:31,086
Oh.

257
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:32,628
They do.

258
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,514
Oh, dear. I wonder if I can catch her.

259
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,270
Oh, Miss Babcock.

260
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,198
♪ Miss Babcock ♪

261
00:12:54,051 --> 00:12:59,927
Oh, Niles, I'm gonna have to tell Mr.
Sheffield I'm backing out of the party.

262
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:01,759
It's turning out to be a real disaster.

263
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,777
Oh, what's the matter, can't get
the 10-foot hero through the door?

264
00:13:05,963 --> 00:13:08,395
You know, Niles, if you're
not part of the solution,

265
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:09,566
you're my mother.

266
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,930
Nah, I'm just gonna have to bite
the bullet and tell him the truth.

267
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:15,082
Miss Fine!

268
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,148
Oh! Uh...

269
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:18,010
burnt down?

270
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:23,826
Aunt Frieda, what are we
gonna do about Maggie's party?

271
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:26,724
Well, I guess I'll just have
to see if Mr. Sheffield...

272
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:31,549
Damn call waiting. So loud.

273
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:36,895
I want the truth, and you
have exactly five seconds.

274
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,508
Maggie wants to have it at Aunt Frieda's,

275
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,824
and Aunt Frieda said ma can't come,

276
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,670
and ma said if I have it there,
she'll never talk to me again.

277
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,814
Oh you're growing your
hair long. It's very sexy.

278
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,009
Miss Fine!

279
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:50,544
All right. All right!

280
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,826
If you'll just remain calm,

281
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:55,544
I will answer all of your questions.

282
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:59,289
How did your mother get mixed
up in his daughter's sweet 16?

283
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:04,123
I said I would answer all of his questions.

284
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:06,290
All right.

285
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,749
If we can't have the party there,
then what do you propose we do?

286
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,220
Hmm?

287
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,668
Well, I was thinking about the Guggenheim.

288
00:14:12,683 --> 00:14:15,521
It's gone! I just canceled it!

289
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:17,113
What did you do that for?

290
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:19,499
It sounded so lovely with the grand foyer,

291
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,038
long white gloves, pink satin gowns.

292
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:23,119
What are you looking for?

293
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:26,062
The murder confession I
wrote the night I hired you.

294
00:14:27,103 --> 00:14:30,156
Margaret has her heart
set on tantuh fajita,

295
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:31,943
so you better bloody well make it happen!

296
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:39,277
[Doorbell rings] Hello.

297
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:41,229
Wow!

298
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:44,437
Get a load of this joint.

299
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:49,202
If I knew it was so fancy, I would
have slipped on the stairs outside.

300
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,926
Aunt Frieda, you're
late. Where have you been?

301
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:55,849
I wanted to talk to you
before she gets here.

302
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,860
Who?

303
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:58,187
Hi!

304
00:14:58,948 --> 00:14:59,979
Her.

305
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:03,249
What is she doing here?

306
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:04,991
She invited me!

307
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:06,867
You're not welcome here!

308
00:15:06,868 --> 00:15:08,500
Fine! I'm leaving!

309
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:12,669
Block them. They're getting away!

310
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:27,409
Noooooo!

311
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,080
Cake!

312
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:36,119
See the nice frosting?

313
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:39,963
And it's chocolate, not
yellow on the inside.

314
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,412
Come on, Frieda. Come on, ma.

315
00:15:44,004 --> 00:15:45,591
Come to the couch.

316
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:47,253
Sit down.

317
00:15:47,558 --> 00:15:48,549
Sit...

318
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,501
Sit...

319
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,913
Sit down. That's good, girls.

320
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:54,080
No! No treats until I tell you.

321
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:56,703
First we're going to talk.

322
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:59,121
You want to talk? Fine.

323
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,098
I'll be the bigger person.

324
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,438
Drop dead.

325
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:09,807
Cook for me, and I will.

326
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,937
Your father was the
first bulimic in flushing.

327
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:19,627
Hey, hey!

328
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,300
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

329
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,527
Whoo ooh ooh ooh ooh!

330
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:25,385
Ooh!

331
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:28,951
I want to find out how
this whole feud got started.

332
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,872
Well, it was, uh...

333
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,761
- Lots of things.
- Plenty of stuff.

334
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:36,308
You know, I don't believe you two yentas.

335
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,166
You don't even remember.

336
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,414
What happened? You were both so close!

337
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,359
Do you remember at that wedding

338
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:47,388
when your *** wiglet caught on
fire from Uncle Zev's cigar?

339
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,698
Who was the one that poured
the celery dish on your head?

340
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:52,457
It was an emergency.

341
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,546
Anybody would have done the same.

342
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,088
And do you remember at
little Irvie's bar mitzvah

343
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:02,755
when there was only one
end cut of prime rib left,

344
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:04,919
who took the middle?

345
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:08,229
I know how she loves it,

346
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,825
and it didn't mean that much to me.

347
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:14,647
Oh, Frieda, she's right.

348
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,701
Have the party with my blessing.

349
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:20,016
And you'll come and you'll dance.

350
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,794
Oh, you lost so much weight!

351
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:26,837
Aw, now, you see?

352
00:17:26,874 --> 00:17:29,446
This is the way it should be,

353
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:33,619
hugging, not trying to screw each
other out of Grandma Fine's pearls.

354
00:17:33,675 --> 00:17:36,033
She took my mother's pearls?

355
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:38,448
I have to sleep with her son!

356
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:39,912
Whoa there!

357
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,815
Chocolate sauce!

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,260
Well, Miss Fine, you certainly seem
to have outdone yourself this time.

359
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,473
Thank you.

360
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:59,164
So what are your plans for later,

361
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:01,673
going to raffle off a Ford Granada?

362
00:18:03,074 --> 00:18:04,701
Very funny.

363
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:07,810
Why don't you just admit
that this place is fabulous?

364
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,925
What's that on the bar?

365
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:10,901
Where?

366
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:15,581
Milk dud.

367
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:22,256
Oh, gee, I hope Aunt Frieda took the
vending machines out of the bathrooms.

368
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:23,783
What vending machines?

369
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,447
Daddy, can I have a dollar?

370
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:28,875
- You can buy balloons in the bathroom.
- Honey, honey, go boogie.

371
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,992
So who does your hair?

372
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,794
I wish I could get that heighth.

373
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:37,759
Oh, please. I wish I had your voice.

374
00:18:37,778 --> 00:18:40,155
I swear, I close my eyes,

375
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,713
it's Julie Budd.

376
00:18:43,271 --> 00:18:45,517
- Oh, wait, Frieda!
- What?

377
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:48,883
You're giving everyone a
show they didn't pay for.

378
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,743
Ma, didn't you see? Why
didn't you say something?

379
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,381
Oh...

380
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:55,447
Now I remember.

381
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,612
That's what started all this.

382
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:00,288
We were at Irwin and Cookie's 25th.

383
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:02,685
I'm on the dance floor doing the alley cat

384
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,125
with my tush hanging out
for the whole world to see,

385
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,503
and she didn't say one word!

386
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,109
What do you want from me?

387
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,194
I'm oblivious sometimes.

388
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:12,939
Sometimes?

389
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:16,011
You are so focused on your rear.

390
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:20,585
Meanwhile, you got two
watermelons for sale up front!

391
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:21,943
What?

392
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:25,878
You're jealous 'cause I worked on Broadway.

393
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,343
And who could forget your big line?

394
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:30,715
Goobers or raisinettes?

395
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:37,084
Oh, good, Frieda. Calm down.

396
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,061
What... what... no, no!

397
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:47,776
Ma, ma, please, think of... no! No!

398
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,809
Are you two nuts?

399
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:53,444
You're trying to start a food fight?

400
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,915
Food fight!

401
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:22,210
Miss Fine.

402
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,695
♪ Oh, Miss Fine ♪

403
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,866
Oh, I see you found the camera.

404
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:44,389
Miss Fine...

405
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,247
What happened?

406
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:49,375
Why do you always think something happened?

407
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:52,747
Lovely party.

408
00:20:58,847 --> 00:21:03,026
I am gone two seconds and Bedlam erupts!

409
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,573
Maxwell.

410
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:14,739
She started it, sir.

411
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,417
I wanted this to be perfect,
a-and just look what you've done!

412
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:25,612
Go ahead! Go ahead, look at this mess!

413
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,816
Oh, I know.

414
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:31,156
Bad nanny. Bad nanny!

415
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:34,209
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheffield.

416
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:36,350
Oh, save it, Miss Fine.

417
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:38,144
It's not me you should be apologizing to.

418
00:21:38,188 --> 00:21:40,735
It's Margaret. She's the one
whose party you've ruined!

419
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,246
Fran, we were all having
such a wonderful time!

420
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:45,348
Who's the idiot who turned on the lights?

421
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:50,829
Do you know, Mr. Sheffield?

422
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:53,538
No, I... I went to get the camera.

423
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,110
Aunt Frieda, hit the breaker.

424
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:01,546
Oh, Fran, all my friends say
this is the best party ever.

425
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:03,792
Thank you so much for being so cool.

426
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,513
And dad,

427
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:08,084
well, thanks for paying for it.

428
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:13,209
I... now, Miss Fine...

429
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:16,626
Miss... Miss Fine!

430
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:18,765
Remember who signs your check.

431
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,361
Oh Mr. Sheffield,

432
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,907
I'm not gonna hit you with this.

433
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:25,753
Fake out!

434
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:29,306
Friends?

435
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,515
All right. Friends.

436
00:22:32,571 --> 00:22:34,110
Come here!
