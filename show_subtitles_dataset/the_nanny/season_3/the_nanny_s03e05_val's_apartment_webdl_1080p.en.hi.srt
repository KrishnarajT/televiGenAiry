1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,489
Who the heck is that at
5 o'clock in the morning?

2
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:15,085
They'll wake up the whole house.

3
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:17,317
Niles!

4
00:00:20,515 --> 00:00:22,373
Oh, good. You heard me.

5
00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:24,151
Van Gogh heard you.

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,624
He's dead and missing an ear.

7
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:30,791
Well, that's attractive.

8
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,379
Oh, it's a bite plate. I grind my teeth.

9
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:39,563
You know, my cousin Eileen
ground her teeth down to the gums.

10
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:41,615
She doesn't smile much anymore,

11
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:44,923
but my cousin Bob has never been happier.

12
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:51,060
You sleep in your makeup?

13
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,658
Honey, do you see a ring on this finger?

14
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,020
What if there was a fire?

15
00:00:57,043 --> 00:00:59,194
Do I need some gorgeous fireman

16
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:02,815
climbing over me to save
a 16-year-old heiress?

17
00:01:06,076 --> 00:01:09,174
Ma, what are you doing here so early?

18
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:11,066
This is how you sleep?

19
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,350
Where are your earrings?

20
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,386
Good girl.

21
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,795
- Oh, hello, Niles.
- Good morning.

22
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:24,281
Do I smell banana fritters
with fresh fruit compote?

23
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:25,621
No.

24
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:27,723
Could I?

25
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:35,000
So, as long as I'm here, how
did the date with the doctor go?

26
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,295
The date was canceled.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,672
Oh, well you're gonna
have to get used to that

28
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:40,280
when you're the surgeon's wife.

29
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:43,151
He's a tree surgeon, ma.

30
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:47,044
You can still make reservations
under doctor and Mrs.

31
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:50,460
Ma, listen, I canceled the date.

32
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:55,546
Darling, you think I'm gonna hit you?

33
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:58,793
- Well...
- You decided not to see a doctor?

34
00:01:58,913 --> 00:02:00,006
What are you, sick?

35
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,414
The kids needed me.

36
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:05,036
Fran, you're obsessed with these people.

37
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:07,351
When will you get a life of your own?

38
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,273
You know, ma, I wanted to surprise you.

39
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,725
But I did meet someone.

40
00:02:12,743 --> 00:02:18,318
He's a very successful
investment banker worth zillions.

41
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,469
Aah!

42
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:23,586
The only thing is I had to sign a prenup.

43
00:02:23,706 --> 00:02:25,056
Oh!

44
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:28,460
You see, ma?

45
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,261
I could kill you if I want.

46
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,141
Now lay off.

47
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,700
Fine, leave alone,

48
00:02:36,718 --> 00:02:40,116
have no one to talk to across the dining table,

49
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:42,193
no one to make love with,

50
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,651
believe me darling,

51
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,465
I know what that's like.

52
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,899
Ma, you have daddy.

53
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:50,101

70
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:46,373
Glenn, we couldn't possibly
open our new show without you.

71
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:48,744
Look what you did for Sunset Boulevard.

72
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,227
Sure, I'll hold.

73
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:52,379
- You missed a spot.
- Where?

74
00:03:52,935 --> 00:03:54,230
There.

75
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:56,601
Ha ha ha ha!

76
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:01,287
Oh, nothing. Just playing
with the domestic's head.

77
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:03,915
Uh-huh.

78
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,943
Uh-huh.

79
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:14,602
Maxwell, your coffee's ready.

80
00:04:18,994 --> 00:04:20,333
I'm never gonna pass this test.

81
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,548
I might as well go to a locksmith college.

82
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:25,670
You're gonna do great, honey.

83
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,858
Just go out there and,

84
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:28,410
bring me home an 'A'.

85
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,444
Fran, you're supposed to
tell him to do his best,

86
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:35,674
or you'll make him feel undue pressure
and he'll develop performance anxiety.

87
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,279
I have a history of that with men.

88
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:40,961
B.

89
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:44,621
B, you know what, pass or fail...

90
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,448
what difference does it make, really?

91
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,714
The important thing is, in four
years, you get your trust fund.

92
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,154
Have a good day at school.

93
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:53,555
Bye, Fran.

94
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:56,483
Oh, peace at last.

95
00:04:56,515 --> 00:04:59,011
Finally I can do something for myself.

96
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:02,065
Niles, would you pour me a cup
of coffee and get me the paper?

97
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,392
Miss Fine, it's right there.

98
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:11,130
Thank you.

99
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:16,485
Oh, why do they show pictures
with wedding announcements?

100
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:19,488
Who cares what someone looks
like if they're not available?

101
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:23,342
Divorce announcements... that's
where I want to see a picture.

102
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:28,773
Thanks.

103
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,869
Oh, Fran, I'm desperate.

104
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:32,144
Well, join the club.

105
00:05:32,176 --> 00:05:34,165
We meet once a year at the coliseum.

106
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:37,275
Here I am, I'm 33 years old...

107
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:41,968
How old did you say?

108
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,063
I thought you two were in the same class.

109
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:47,003
Well, I skipped a few
grades. I was very brilliant.

110
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:50,526
She got left back.

111
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:56,483
I can't stand living at home anymore.

112
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,673
My parents treat me like a child.

113
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:02,133
Well, you can't afford
rent on your allowance.

114
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:04,610
Maybe if I got a roommate...

115
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,343
Well, that's a good idea.

116
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:08,746
Oh, no. No, no.

117
00:06:08,758 --> 00:06:10,110
Come on, Fran.

118
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,951
I found this great place just
crawling with single guys.

119
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:17,386
You can still work here during the
day and you know, maybe have a life.

120
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,414
Have you been talking to my mother?

121
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:23,323
It's bad enough I have
to talk to my mother.

122
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,664
Now you think I spend my
spare time talking to yours?

123
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,855
Well, maybe you're right.

124
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:34,585
I'm never going to meet a rich,
eligible bachelor around this place.

125
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:35,836
Hello.

126
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,388
- Hi.
- Hi.

127
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,468
Oh, what am I talking about?

128
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,101
I have a life.

129
00:06:44,094 --> 00:06:46,190
I got a date with a podiatrist.

130
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:47,986
- A foot doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:49,618
You better go do your toes.

132
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,540
Unless, of course, you
don't have personal time.

133
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:56,993
Oh Val, this is only my first date.

134
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,445
What am I, a tramp?

135
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:03,625
These little piggies don't have
to go to his market so fast.

136
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,192
Is that a bunion poking through your shoe,

137
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:11,057
or are you just happy to see me?

138
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,193
Maybe I shouldn't open with that.

139
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:17,026
Hey, Fran.

140
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,379
Brighton! Brighton! You're
not 5 years old anymore.

141
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,568
Why don't you knock?

142
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,339
Because I'm not 5 years old anymore.

143
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:29,663
At least Niles pretends to vacuum.

144
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:32,935
So, we've got a date tonight?

145
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,905
Where's he taking you?
What's he do for a living?

146
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:38,339
Ma... go out of here.

147
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,404
You have more privacy on a kibbutz.

148
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:43,770
Fran, when are you going to
help me with my dinosaur project?

149
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:47,117
Oh honey, I promise, I
promise I'll do it tomorrow.

150
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:53,813
Gracie, that whining is so annoying.

151
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,884
Where did you pick that up?

152
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,892
Fran, help! My hair's
caught in my blow dryer!

153
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:06,632
Oh, I should have stopped after one.

154
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:19,590
She's not here.

155
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,888
I've never played
footsie with a pro before.

156
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:49,092
Relax.

157
00:08:49,117 --> 00:08:52,715
It's not like we're two kids on the
porch, and your dad's flicking lights.

158
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:53,872
Yeah.

159
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:58,683
Fran, you're 24 years old.

160
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:02,725
Wow. Not till July.

161
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,579
- He shouldn't be doing this to you.
- I know.

162
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:08,987
Daddy!

163
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:12,141
Maybe I should go.

164
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,080
- I'll call you.
- Bye.

165
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,663
Thank you.

166
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:23,490
Oh, good. You're back.

167
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:26,700
Brighton insists you tuck him in.

168
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,482
We'll discuss that later.

169
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,478
Margaret is sobbing in front of a mirror...

170
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:31,873
"my bangs, my bangs",

171
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,526
and I have a dinosaur
perma-glued to my hand.

172
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:40,756
What?

173
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,171
What!

174
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:44,586
Didn't you see what just happened?

175
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:47,933
I was in the middle of a
date, and you interrupted me!

176
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:50,379
Calm down, Miss Fine.

177
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,024
It happens so infrequently.

178
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,363
No.

179
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,111
You are always cutting
into my personal time.

180
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:58,832
No, I meant you having a date.

181
00:10:00,696 --> 00:10:04,261
Meanwhile, I'm not the one
sitting home on a Saturday night

182
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:07,070
with his hand glued to his brontosaurus.

183
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,949
Just tell me how to get it off.

184
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,782
Try blowing in his ear.

185
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:19,270
Oh, all right.

186
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,351
There's a special trick.

187
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:22,197
Put your other hand over your mouth.

188
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:24,774
Aah!

189
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:31,269
You know, I'm telling you Mr. Sheffield,

190
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:34,810
between you and the kids, I
don't have a life of my own.

191
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:38,983
Maybe I should've told Val I'd
move into that apartment with her.

192
00:10:39,158 --> 00:10:42,674
Come on, Miss Fine, you live
upstairs, and you're late for work.

193
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,389
Well, excuse me, but I
like to look presentable.

194
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,534
I'm not the type to come down to breakfast

195
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:56,200
looking like a schlub in a big
bathrobe and fuzzy slippers.

196
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:58,621
Look, the point is...

197
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,806
we're getting off the subject here.

198
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,971
The thing is,

199
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,912
you don't have to get so defensive with me

200
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,115
just because I said I
might need some space.

201
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,154
I know you'd miss me.

202
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:15,253
Yes, well, let's see,
what would I miss most...

203
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:19,170
sitting on your Daisy razor every
time I step into the jacuzzi tub

204
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:23,424
or having to readjust my treadmill
every morning after you set it to **.

205
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:30,794
You know, you're no prize
to live with either, mister.

206
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:32,320
I got a news flash for you.

207
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,103
That accent of yours...

208
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,462
very annoying!

209
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,599
And why, every time you leave the
room, do you have to mention cereals?

210
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,564
What the bloody hell you talking about now?

211
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:46,922
Cheerios, cheerios.

212
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:52,609
Well, I'll have you know you have some
pretty annoying little habits of your own.

213
00:11:57,727 --> 00:11:59,948
Well, I'm waiting, give me your best shot.

214
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,712
All right, fine.

215
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,863
Get your own place.

216
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,371
You'll come crawling back.

217
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:06,398
Only after you begged me

218
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,227
'cause you won't even
last a week without me.

219
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:12,423
What, you think I'm incapable of
putting three children to sleep.

220
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,762
Oh, not at all.

221
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:15,782
Just plump them in the front
row of one of your show.

222
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:18,360
All right. That's it. Out!

223
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,781
I want to be seeing you from the rear.

224
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,680
Oh, it's too late for flattery now, mister.

225
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:36,867
- Schlemiel!
- Schlemiel!

226
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,851
- Schlimazel!
- Schlimazel!

227
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,011
- Incorporated!
- Incorporated!

228
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:47,134
Oh, my God, Val.

229
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,543
This is it?

230
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:52,734
Well, I said it was a little small.

231
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:54,085
"A little small"?

232
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:56,862
Thing had more room than this.

233
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:01,279
At least it's a roof over our
heads to keep us dry from the rain.

234
00:13:01,305 --> 00:13:03,939
It's not raining, Val.

235
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:05,841
Hey, lady! Curb your dog!

236
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,137
Oh, my God!

237
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:10,502
A roach! A roach!

238
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,767
Well, take your shoe off and kill it.

239
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:19,318
Oh, my God.

240
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:21,833
I moved in with Forrest Gump.

241
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:26,620
Val, I can't believe you leased this place.

242
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:30,512
Boy, I'd like to see the moron
that talked you into this dump.

243
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:31,613
Hello.

244
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:40,554
Welcome, ladies, to my humble commode.

245
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:43,319
You got that right.

246
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,665
So, let me guess... you're the landlord.

247
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,836
Oh, no. You flatter me.

248
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:53,516
I share the landlording responsibilities
with my significant other other Leonard.

249
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:57,996
Why, we've been together
now for, oh, 17 years.

250
00:13:58,027 --> 00:14:00,667
17 years, and still no children.

251
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,300
Tsk tsk tsk.

252
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,802
But we keep trying.

253
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:09,539
The place is just crawling
with single men, Val?

254
00:14:09,602 --> 00:14:12,010
Perhaps somebody should have thought twice

255
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:16,915
before renting an apartment across
the street from the Judy Holliday Inn.

256
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,399
Excuse me, ladies.

257
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:22,508
I must bid you a doo-doo,

258
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:26,637
because tonight is our 17th anniversary

259
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:31,787
and Leonard is very busy
preparing a boeuf bourgignon.

260
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,697
17 is meat.

261
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:44,731
All right. Calm down.

262
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:48,622
There's got to be at least a couple of
guys here who'll be interested in us.

263
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,651
♪ clang clang clang went the trolley ♪

264
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:57,374
♪ ding ding ding went the bell ♪

265
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:18,639
Oh, my God.

266
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,553
Val! Val! I overslept.

267
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,243
I'm gonna be late for work.

268
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:25,465
What are we doing up at the crack of dawn?

269
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:28,418
I don't think it's dawn's
crack we're looking at.

270
00:15:30,489 --> 00:15:31,603
Hey!

271
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,436
Well, there you go.

272
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:36,120
It's 3 past 8:00. She's late.

273
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:39,955
The tramp. She probably woke
up in some gigolo's apartment.

274
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:44,016
What luck... she can probably
return your toiletries.

275
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,635
Oh, I just love being an independent woman.

276
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,606
Niles, thanks for the casserole.

277
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:53,720
The whites are in the wash.

278
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,015
The darks are in the sink.

279
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:57,612
So who's the bigger nut...

280
00:15:57,618 --> 00:15:59,608
the woman who takes
two buses and the subway

281
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:01,266
in her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers

282
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,730
or the man who pays her
to raise his children?

283
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:08,573
Nanny Fine, it must be
great to have your own place

284
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:11,645
and not be just a brunette Kato Kaelin.

285
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,632
Like he's a natural blonde.

286
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:19,992
Of all people not to know that.

287
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:23,765
Fran, I'm so jealous.

288
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:25,886
So are there any cute
guys in your new building?

289
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,269
Oh, are you kidding?

290
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:29,822
They're coming out of the closet.

291
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,943
So, uh, tell me, how was
your first night without me?

292
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,434
Well, actually, Miss Fine, the
evening went off without a hitch.

293
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,919
Yes, we did our homework,
we tidied our rooms,

294
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,426
we roughhoused.

295
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,891
And then Mr. Sheffield
came home from the club.

296
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,469
Niles,

297
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:55,017
maybe you should close the window
before your Christmas bonus flies out.

298
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:57,983
Ooh, I'm gonna be late.

299
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,348
Dad, I need that 50 bucks for
those books in school today.

300
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:02,925
Oh, right. There you go, son.

301
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:04,133
Have a good day at school.

302
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:07,911
Uh, dad, I need some lunch money.

303
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:10,045
There you are, sweetheart.

304
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:11,020
Thanks.

305
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:13,929
So, you see, Miss Fine?

306
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:16,882
I can manage perfectly well without you.

307
00:17:17,164 --> 00:17:18,603
Uh-huh.

308
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,286
You do know it's Saturday?

309
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:33,424
Oh, live and let live.

310
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,582
Ah, isn't this great?

311
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:39,580
It's Saturday night, and we're
living in a building filled with guys.

312
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,520
All gay.

313
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,005
I could change them.

314
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:51,030
Val, did I forget to thank you

315
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:55,153
for picking a building walking
distance from grandma yetta's home?

316
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,314
Uh, may we please be excused?

317
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,340
No.

318
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,224
This is family time.

319
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,938
We should talk about...

320
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,922
family things.

321
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,114
Ok.

322
00:18:29,646 --> 00:18:30,841
When you go,

323
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,618
have you already decided who gets what,

324
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,190
or can we go around and put
little stickers on stuff?

325
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:38,630
- All right. You may be excused.
- Thank you.

326
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:45,631
Niles, old man, pull up a
chair and have a cup of coffee.

327
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,252
Oh, thank you, sir.

328
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,649
There you go.

329
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,354
May I have some cream, sir?

330
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,477
Yeah, of course, old man.

331
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:08,463
- Say when.
- When.

332
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:13,643
I'll take a little sugar.

333
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:22,208
Oh, two lumps.

334
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:29,941
I've got such a yen for those
pepperidge farm mint Milano...

335
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:32,913
- don't push it, Niles.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:40,664
You know, Niles, it really is rather

337
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:44,237
peaceful without having
Miss Fine flapping about.

338
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:47,678
You see, this is what a real
nanny is supposed to do...

339
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:51,019
take care of the children, then go home.

340
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:53,203
How do you propose we get her back?

341
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:54,892
I don't know. Any ideas?

342
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,195
Well,

343
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,466
I'm on my way home,

344
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:08,726
unless, of course, there's something
you need me for that you can't admit to.

345
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,242
No.

346
00:20:11,692 --> 00:20:14,708
Unless there's some reason you want
to stay that you can't fess up to.

347
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:17,380
Hah. Fat chance.

348
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,620
Oh.

349
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:24,282
Ma, what are you doing here?

350
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:26,096
I came to talk to him.

351
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:28,587
I beg your pardon?

352
00:20:28,612 --> 00:20:30,413
How can you sleep at night

353
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,616
knowing my daughter's living in that dump,

354
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:36,164
traveling back and forth
at all hours of the night?

355
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:38,591
Ma! You can't talk to my boss like that.

356
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,000
And you, pack your bags.
You're moving back in.

357
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,690
No, I'm a grown woman,
I'm not afraid of you.

358
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,172
Oh! Oh! Oh!

359
00:20:45,222 --> 00:20:46,536
I'm sorry, mommy.

360
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:49,689
Sylvia, it appears your
daughter has made her decision.

361
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:51,973
And it's simply not your place...

362
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:55,871
I'll send a limo for her things.

363
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:59,806
Ma, this is the most embarrassing
thing you have ever...

364
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,459
Oh, good. He's gone. Ma, you were fabulous!

365
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,146
I owe you.

366
00:21:08,545 --> 00:21:11,861
All I ask in return is a cup of coffee,

367
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,713
a few snackwells,

368
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,652
and maybe a grandchild.

369
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:19,075
Well, let's start with the cup of coffee.

370
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:20,564
That I can make by myself.

371
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:27,765
Sylvia, you were sublime.

372
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:34,515
Here, as promised... two tickets
to Showboat for you and Morty.

373
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:36,035
Oh,

374
00:21:36,223 --> 00:21:39,164
I guess we'll eat at home first.

375
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:44,349
And dinner for two at Sardi's.

376
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,314
Oh, if you insist.

377
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:55,261
So I take it you're moving back in.

378
00:21:55,642 --> 00:21:58,414
Well, you know, for ma's sake.

379
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,174
Well, she only has your interests at heart.

380
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:06,867
How much did it cost you?

381
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,061
Showboat tickets. You?

382
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:14,514
Grandchildren.

383
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:20,258
Uh look, I intended this as an apartment-

384
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,733
warming present, but uh... well,

385
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:26,565
- welcome home.
- Oh, Mr. Sheffield,

386
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:29,983
that is so sweet.

387
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:32,517
Judy Garland.
