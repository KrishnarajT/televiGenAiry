1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,913
So, did you have a nice evening?

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:09,050
Oh, I'll tell you. It
was a beautiful wedding.

3
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:11,713
Val and I cried our eyes out.

4
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,530
She made some gorgeous
bride, that Dr. Quinn.

5
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,411
Fran, where's our TV guide?

6
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:19,924
Right here.

7
00:00:19,925 --> 00:00:21,109
Give me your best shot.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,536
Alrighty. Channel 29.

9
00:00:23,537 --> 00:00:26,368
What follows the Ghost and Mrs. Muir?

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,220
That would be...

11
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,183
Family affair...

12
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,984
the episode where Mr. French accidentally
drops Ms. Beasley off the terrace,

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,414
followed by the Munsters
with Marilyn number two,

14
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:37,199
followed by Bewitched
with Darrin number one,

15
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:38,654
but Mrs. Kravitz number two.

16
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,877
Bravo, Miss Fine.

17
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,858
You seem to know more about sixties television
than most people your age have forgotten.

18
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:49,189
Well, are you calling
me old or just stupid?

19
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:55,641
You have a childlike quality
that I find absolutely charming.

20
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,846
- Childlike?
- Just stupid.

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,945
Well what does he expect? All
I do is talk to kids all day.

22
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,118
You know, if someone would keep their
head out of the paper in the morning,

23
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,974
maybe I can have an adult conversation.

24
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:13,219
Oh, look, ** is playing at the ** theater.

25
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:17,755
Alright Miss Fine, you want
an adult conversation.. .

26
00:01:17,756 --> 00:01:20,219
- Yes I do.
- Let's talk. Hmm...

27
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:22,564
Affirmative action, for or against?

28
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:26,691
Against. Get rid of affirmative
action, those creams don't work.

29
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:30,816
My mother has been schmering
them on her thighs for years,

30
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:33,768
and she still looks like she
fell asleep in a wicker chair.

50
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:29,867
Ooh! Now they're unloading a couch.

51
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:31,512
No, it's a sectional.

52
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:35,135
No, it's a love seat and a chaise.

53
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,326
- No...
- Oh, you stop it! You're driving me crazy!

54
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:40,946
Shh!

55
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:43,224
What if the person
moving in is a single guy?

56
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:45,729
If he hears you yelling at me,
he's gonna think we're married.

57
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,260
I'm sorry, Miss Fine.

58
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:51,062
I'm just obsessing over
something in the newspaper.

59
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:52,926
Oh, you want to talk about it?

60
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:55,142
No, I don't think it's
anything you'd be interested in.

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,200
I could fake it. Wouldn't
be the first time.

62
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:01,786
Well, alright. It's president
Clinton's Renaissance weekend,

63
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,669
and I was hoping I'd be invited.

64
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:06,478
Oh, Renaissance weekend?

65
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:08,154
Boy, Clinton goes to those things?

66
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,951
'Cause I'm thinking tights and a
pointy hat is not his best look.

67
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:15,818
No, Miss Fine, not the Renaissance Faire!

68
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:17,107
The Renaissance weekend.

69
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,868
It's a yearly gathering of the
best minds from every walk of life.

70
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:23,240
They only invite one member
of the Broadway community,

71
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,686
and you know the one
name that's ahead of mine.

72
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,356
Right, who comes before Sheffield?

73
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,859
A, b, c, d, e, f... r!

74
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:32,506
Phylicia Rashad is before Mr. Sheffield.

75
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,989
No, Miss Fine, not Phylicia Rashad.

76
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,742
It's Andrew Lloyd Webber!

77
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:40,263
Webber? "W" is before "S"?

78
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,771
Boy, and they call me stupid.

79
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:49,422
Well, it's 12:30.

80
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,468
Where is this brother of you C.C?

81
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,025
Brother?

82
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,382
There's a brother coming?

83
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,198
Is he short, ugly, and married?

84
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:57,518
No. Why?

85
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,976
Well, then, I got to change.

86
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,770
Nanny fine, please.

87
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:05,720
He is a full-time professor
at Northwestern University.

88
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,816
Well, I don't mind moving down south.

89
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:14,171
Oh, it'll be so wonderful
to see Noel again.

90
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,931
We used to have so much fun.

91
00:04:16,051 --> 00:04:18,434
Every summer he'd take
me to the horse show.

92
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:19,773
Did you ever win?

93
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:27,353
Maxwell, will you put that out?

94
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:28,931
It's stinking up the house.

95
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,802
Oh C.C., I thought you liked cigars.

96
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:31,741
I meant him.

97
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,712
Oh. He's here.

98
00:04:37,516 --> 00:04:40,237
Ohh! We were just like best friends!

99
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:41,670
- Sir.
- C.C.

100
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,165
- Ha ha ha!
- Noel!

101
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,381
- Yes!
- You've been working out.

102
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,467
I smell Lady Stetson.

103
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,874
Mommy gave you this.

104
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:58,662
She gave you the Beemer.

105
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,053
She gave you the Benz.

106
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:02,530
C.C., mommy died yesterday.

107
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:04,507
- What'd you get?
- Gotcha!

108
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,694
I walked right into that!

109
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,917
He used to keep me in stitches
with all that "mommy died" stuff.

110
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:16,245
Oh, yes. Charming.

111
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:20,449
Oh, I didn't know we had company.

112
00:05:21,306 --> 00:05:23,984
Isn't anyone going to introduce us?

113
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:28,089
Alright, this is my charming,
wealthy, educated brother Noel.

114
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,553
Noel, this is the help.

115
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,944
I'm Dr. Noel Babcock.

116
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,828
Oh, a teacher and a doctor!

117
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,249
Your mother must be kvelling!

118
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,028
Miss fine, don't you have something to do?

119
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:46,689
He thinks that I can't
handle an adult conversation.

120
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,285
Want a juicy juice?

121
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:52,508
Maybe I'd learn something if
I hung out with the Professor.

122
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,004
It worked for Mary Ann and Ginger!

123
00:05:58,126 --> 00:05:59,815
Is something going on
with Max and the nanny?

124
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:00,541
No!

125
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:03,807
- Huh?
- I mean, Maxwell is an educated man.

126
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:05,715
She went to nick at nite school.

127
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:10,320
C.C., would you like to have some fun?

128
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:12,842
Oh, I thought that was against the law.

129
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:15,000
No. No.

130
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,034
No. No. No.

131
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,885
No. I meant a little wager.

132
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,175
I say the nanny can be taught.

133
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:24,485
Oh, please don't make me take your money.

134
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:28,264
This is a woman who thought
Clarence Thomas was on the Mod Squad.

135
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:32,737
Stop it. You're gonna
make me go right here.

136
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:38,462
Ohhh. Ohhh.

137
00:06:40,257 --> 00:06:42,920
My Lamborghini against
your prize thoroughbred.

138
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:43,992
You choose the test.

139
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:45,632
Well...

140
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,516
the only thing she knows is television.

141
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:50,405
I'll make it easy for you.

142
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:51,932
Get her on Jeopardy!

143
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,922
Ha ha ha ha!

144
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,079
All right. You're on.

145
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,921
Oh oh oh, I can't wait to get
behind the wheel of that car.

146
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,480
And I can't wait to get
behind that race horse.

147
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,808
Well, you know what I mean.

148
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,452
Ohhh. Ohhh.

149
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:20,350
No, ma, no. It's not that kind of doctor.

150
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,539
'Cause he is a Ph... you can't
write prescription, can you?

151
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:25,904
No.

152
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,625
That's what your insurance is for.

153
00:07:28,644 --> 00:07:31,272
Would you just call your HMO. Oy.

154
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,691
Fran, you are enchanting.

155
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,322
I don't know why you're
insecure about your intelligence.

156
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:41,507
I mean if you're smart
enough to get on Jeopardy!

157
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,009
Who got on Jeopardy!

158
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:45,062
Well C.C. told me you'd
been on a game show.

159
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:45,988
So I naturally assumed...

160
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:47,527
Oh, please.

161
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,540
Studs.

162
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,496
That's not really a mind game.

163
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:58,192
No, you got to be a
genius to be on Jeopardy!

164
00:07:58,193 --> 00:08:02,336
I mean, my own cousin can't get
on, and she finds Waldo every week.

165
00:08:04,181 --> 00:08:05,395
I'll bet you could do it.

166
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:07,947
Nah, I couldn't possibly
find Waldo every week,

167
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:11,620
especially in those beach scenes
when he's not wearing his shirt.

168
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:15,912
No. No. I meant getting on Jeopardy!

169
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:17,832
Would you like to try a few questions?

170
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:19,610
Ok.

171
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,444
Alex, I love your tie.

172
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,938
What?

173
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,797
Alex Trebek, dumb-dumb.

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,489
I heard that if you flirt with him,
he locks out the other guys' buzzers.

175
00:08:32,723 --> 00:08:35,276
Ooh. I'm going to be good at this!

176
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,380
Right. Ahem.

177
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:41,177
Famous monarchs.

178
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:43,054
Oh, that's easy.

179
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:46,270
The most famous monarch
was the '72 Mercury.

180
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:55,261
More specifically, the one my ex-boyfriend
Danny drove, and I'm the one that made it famous.

181
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:58,276
And I'm the one that made it famous.

182
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,103
Moving on.

183
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,118
Astronomy.

184
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,034
This is the oldest body orbiting the sun.

185
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:12,705
What is William Shatner?

186
00:09:21,307 --> 00:09:22,696
Oh, my head.

187
00:09:22,816 --> 00:09:27,489
Aw, you know, the same thing
happens to Mr. Sheffield.

188
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,310
Gee, it must be something in this room.

189
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:32,220
- Fran?
- Yes.

190
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:34,316
Would you mind if we pick this up tomorrow?

191
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:36,818
Oh, sure. Sure. No problem.

192
00:09:37,157 --> 00:09:40,122
There's a set of steel-belted
radials I've got to stop payment on.

193
00:09:43,143 --> 00:09:45,927
Bye, Noel. Thank you.

194
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:48,906
Did Noel leave? Oh, I'm sorry I missed him.

195
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,432
Well, I miss him, too.

196
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:54,061
It's nice to have a man around
who notices my inane intelligence.

197
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:58,215
Miss fine, I noticed that when you
first threw a penny in the bidet

198
00:09:58,335 --> 00:09:59,448
and made a wish.

199
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:04,001
Oh, don't try and get
on my good side, mister.

200
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:07,618
For your information,
Noel finds me stimulating.

201
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:13,461
Believe me, it's not your mind
that's aroused his interest.

202
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:17,721
You know, there is only one
explanation for your negativity.

203
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:20,656
Oh, please. You think I'm jealous of Noel?

204
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,395
That makes two.

205
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,258
You just don't want me to
reach my full potential.

206
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,959
You want to keep me in that
kitchen barefoot and pregnant.

207
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,019
You're the one who wanted to have children!

208
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,246
You even made it your full-time job!

209
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:36,937
Oh, God. What am I saying?

210
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:42,587
Meanwhile, Professor Noel Babcock, Ph.D.,

211
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:45,634
thinks that I'm smart
enough to get on Jeopardy!

212
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:46,604
How do you like that?

213
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:48,543
- Jeopardy?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:50,965
Oh. Remind me what night does that tape.

215
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:51,735
I should leave it open.

216
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,469
No. As a matter of fact, I
should block out the entire week.

217
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,434
They ask the champion back, you know?

218
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:00,594
That's right.

219
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:03,785
And let's hope that it's not
on the same night as Clinton's

220
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,693
Renaissance weekend.

221
00:11:05,813 --> 00:11:10,298
Oh, look. It doesn't matter
because you're not invited.

222
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:12,699
- Let me see that.
- No.

223
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:15,234
It could be a category on Jeopardy!

224
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:17,417
Member of the Broadway community

225
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:20,776
who is invited to the Renaissance weekend.

226
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,621
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

227
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,368
Sorry. That is incorrect.

228
00:11:25,488 --> 00:11:26,181
Really?

229
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:27,921
The correct response would be

230
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:30,330
who is Andrew Lloyd Webber?

231
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:38,770
It's no good, Niles.

232
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:40,484
I can't concentrate.

233
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,736
It's too bloody quiet.

234
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:44,275
What on earth's missing?

235
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,352
Well, perhaps this will help, sir.

236
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,336
Oh, Mr. Sheffield.

237
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:53,704
That's it, Niles.

238
00:11:53,724 --> 00:11:55,294
Miss fine's not here.

239
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,559
Just trying to fill your void, sir.

240
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:58,835
It's obvious you miss her.

241
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:01,782
I most certainly do not.

242
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,260
I'm just wondering where
she is, what she's doing,

243
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,588
which is entirely
different from missing her.

244
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:10,291
What?

245
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:11,348
Oh, nothing, sir.

246
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:13,839
I was just wondering
how you ended up there,

247
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,340
and I ended up here.

248
00:12:18,751 --> 00:12:20,809
Seems wrong somehow.

249
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:24,619
She's probably with Noel.

250
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:27,684
You know, Niles, that relationship
doesn't make any sense.

251
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:29,882
I mean... what on earth
does he want with her?

252
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,645
Sir, is it beyond your comprehension

253
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,066
that an intelligent man of the world

254
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:35,487
could find Miss Fine
intellectually stimulating?

255
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:37,708
No, really, Niles.

256
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,897
Oh, all right. It's a bet.

257
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:43,045
Miss Babcock's brother

258
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:46,041
bet her that he could
get Miss Fine on Jeopardy!

259
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:46,661
A bet.

260
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,850
I knew he had an ulterior motive.

261
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:51,178
So you're not going to rub
Miss Fine's nose in it, are you?

262
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,710
Of course not.

263
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,313
Is that her?

264
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:57,547
Now, sir.

265
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,799
Oh, hello.

266
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,139
Didn't hear you come in.

267
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:06,004
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, guess what?

268
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:07,356
I passed the test.

269
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:09,633
I'm going to be on Jeopardy!

270
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:16,785
Would you look at her?

271
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:18,130
She's so happy for me.

272
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:23,354
I paid $200,000 for that stallion.

273
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:26,897
I hope he paid for the room.

274
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,922
Fran, I am so proud of you.

275
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:35,293
Your thirsty mind soaked up all
that knowledge like a sponge.

276
00:13:35,537 --> 00:13:37,897
Now if you'll excuse me. I
have to see a man about a horse.

277
00:13:37,909 --> 00:13:39,123
Ha ha ha!

278
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,432
Ohhh.

279
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:47,037
You passed the test?

280
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:48,382
Yes.

281
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:51,518
You see, that is the
difference between you and Noel.

282
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,595
He thinks I'm a sponge.

283
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:56,311
Are you through, Miss Fine?

284
00:13:56,323 --> 00:13:59,570
- Because I...
- No, you know, you're so smart and powerful.

285
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:02,448
Everybody always listens to
everything you have to say.

286
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,839
- Well, Miss Fine...
- Wait. I'm talking.

287
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,137
We both know that I'm not as
smart or cultured as you are.

288
00:14:09,144 --> 00:14:11,108
I mean, remember when I first moved here

289
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:13,942
and you asked me where was the cabernet.

290
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:15,356
And what did I say?

291
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:17,591
Next to cabin B.

292
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:23,278
Although I never did take Spanish.

293
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:27,501
Oh Mr. Sheffield,

294
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:29,147
you have no idea what

295
00:14:29,153 --> 00:14:32,926
gaining the respect from a man
like Noel means to a girl like me.

296
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:34,872
Now what was it you wanted to say?

297
00:14:37,368 --> 00:14:39,026
Good luck on Jeopardy! Miss Fine.

298
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,848
Ohhh. Thank you, Mr. Sheffield.

299
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:43,274
Now I gotta go call my mother

300
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,869
'cause nobody in my family
has been on a game show

301
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,078
since my cousin ira was queen for a day.

302
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,574
Ok. Questions, kids. Drill me.

303
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,108
Ok, Fran. The category is pot-pourri.

304
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:00,004
Things that smell good,
things you put in a dish.

305
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,243
No, Fran, Fran. That's the pyramid.

306
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:03,050
What is Egypt?

307
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:04,383
You're running out of time.

308
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:06,066
I'll solve the puzzle!

309
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:08,093
Miss Fine.

310
00:15:08,137 --> 00:15:09,219
What is a nanny?

311
00:15:09,226 --> 00:15:10,371
Things that are single.

312
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:13,805
Calm down. Calm down.

313
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:15,925
There are plenty of other contestants.

314
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:17,898
They're all backups.
You don't have to go on.

315
00:15:18,198 --> 00:15:19,399
Are you kidding me?

316
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,508
I already cut the tags out of this dress.

317
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:23,310
I'm definitely going on.

318
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,581
- Five minutes!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

319
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:26,588
Break a leg.

320
00:15:26,907 --> 00:15:29,122
Fran, you look so beautiful.

321
00:15:29,147 --> 00:15:30,911
Oh, thanks, sweetie.

322
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:33,708
But, you know, beauty is
not what's important here.

323
00:15:33,828 --> 00:15:35,923
It's brains that count.

324
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,492
Oh, hey, you.

325
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:42,235
I want that same filter that they used
on Liz for the White Diamonds commercial.

326
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,167
Before we continue, let's recap the scores.

327
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:50,938
We have henrietta at $4,600,

328
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:53,285
Stewart next at 4,700,

329
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:58,290
and Fran close behind at minus 1,300.

330
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:01,112
But, Fran, please don't get discouraged.

331
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,674
Oh, I'm fine, Alex.

332
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:07,962
I'm just getting my taste buds ready for
my year's supply of Chico-San rice cakes.

333
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:09,895
Good for you.

334
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:11,810
Stewart, you gave me the
last correct response,

335
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,418
so you have control of the board.

336
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:14,907
Thank you, Alex.

337
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,528
By the way, nice tie.

338
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,831
Oh, please.

339
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,929
I'll take inventors for 400, please.

340
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:24,680
Answer.

341
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,056
The name Thomas,

342
00:16:26,062 --> 00:16:28,214
was made famous in 1880,

343
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:29,309
for this

344
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:30,985
household invention.

345
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:31,900
Stewart?

346
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:33,958
What is the light bulb?

347
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,572
No. I'm sorry. That's incorrect.

348
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:36,579
Henrietta.

349
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,350
What is the phonograph?

350
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:40,427
No. That, too, is incorrect.

351
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:41,940
Fran, would you like to try?

352
00:16:42,478 --> 00:16:43,191
Huh?

353
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:48,685
The name Thomas was made famous in
1880 for this household invention.

354
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:52,020
What is the fork-split English muffin?

355
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:56,068
That's absolutely right.

356
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:00,398
Come on, people.

357
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,400
In 1875...

358
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,483
Mr. Thomas left England

359
00:17:04,508 --> 00:17:06,917
and closed his shop up for good

360
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,831
to come to our country.

361
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:12,116
Believe it or not, you're
now in control of the board.

362
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,511
Oh!

363
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:14,599
I'll pick...

364
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,920
food facts for $200.

365
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:18,141
Alex.

366
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,968
The answer is...

367
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,665
a daily double.

368
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,914
I'll bet $1,000, Alex.

369
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:28,528
Answer.

370
00:17:28,778 --> 00:17:31,242
Though usually associated with red beets,

371
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,270
this east European soup...

372
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,628
- Fran.
- What is borscht?

373
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:37,174
You're absolutely right.

374
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,444
Congratulations.

375
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:43,794
And that sound means time
now for our final Jeopardy!

376
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,677
Here is the final Jeopardy! answer.

377
00:17:47,028 --> 00:17:50,219
This city was incorporated
into the Roman Empire

378
00:17:50,407 --> 00:17:52,265
in 30 B.C.

379
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:56,169
after the suicide of Cleopatra. Good luck.

380
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:04,540
Oh. Dropped my earring. Dropped my earring.

381
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,986
Whoa, Nellie.

382
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:08,483
Oh! Found it! Found it.

383
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:10,472
Found the earring.
- What's going on?

384
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:12,981
I found the earring.

385
00:18:12,993 --> 00:18:15,659
I found the earring, is the thing.

386
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,664
All right, contestants.
Time's up. Henrietta,

387
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:33,166
what did you write down as your question?

388
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:34,918
What is Macedonia?

389
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:36,632
I'm sorry. That's wrong.

390
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,033
What was your wager?

391
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,330
4,200. You risked it all.

392
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,045
And that takes you all
the way down to zero.

393
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:44,590
Enjoy the home game, honey.

394
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:47,449
Well, now let's go to Stewart.

395
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:49,039
His response was...

396
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:51,366
What is Cairo?

397
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:54,632
And, unfortunately, he, too, is wrong.

398
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,697
Your wager, please, Stewart, was...

399
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,212
$4199.

400
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:03,822
That takes you down to $101.

401
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:06,237
Still like his tie, Stewie?

402
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:09,184
- Fran.
- Well,

403
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,381
my mother and I were on our way to Israel

404
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,746
on El Al, and who was sitting next to us

405
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:14,953
but Diana Kind,

406
00:19:14,964 --> 00:19:16,896
aka Barbra Streisand's mother,

407
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:18,674
in coach!

408
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:23,080
They got a lot of
unresolved issues, those two.

409
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:28,559
- On her way to see the pyramids in Giza...
- So your response is Giza?

410
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,550
No Mister 'in a hurry'.

411
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:36,236
But talking about Streisand and Egypt

412
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:38,582
reminded me of Omar Sharif,

413
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,985
who, according to my
Funny Girl trivia book,

414
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,469
was not the first actor cast

415
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,279
- in the role of Nicky Arnstein, but...
- Miss Fine!

416
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,243
What is Alexandria?

417
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:50,375
That's right.

418
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,578
You double your score to 200.

419
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:55,274
Fran Fine is the new Jeopardy! Champion.

420
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,265
Hello, Jeopardy!

421
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,156
Yeah, I wanna talk to
you about my Rice-A-Roni.

422
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:25,135
Well, according to my calculations, I got

423
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:26,562
six herb and butter,

424
00:20:26,682 --> 00:20:28,457
six broccoli au gratin,

425
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,966
but only

426
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:32,581
five white cheddar and herb.

427
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:36,497
Now, someone over there ain't so smart.

428
00:20:37,204 --> 00:20:39,419
Isn't that ironic?

429
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,836
Oh, cheer up, Miss Fine.

430
00:20:43,956 --> 00:20:45,600
You won one game.

431
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,497
You don't have to be
the returning champion.

432
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:50,223
I like you just the way you are.

433
00:20:50,224 --> 00:20:52,808
Oh, thanks Mr. Sheffield, but

434
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,840
if you ever saw me just the way I am,

435
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,323
you wouldn't recognize me.

436
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:02,505
Oh, look who's here.

437
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,632
Hi, Roger.

438
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,474
Sheffield,

439
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:11,695
you remember Roger Clinton,

440
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:13,328
the President's brother.

441
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:14,473
- Of course.
- Hi.

442
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:16,143
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

443
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:18,946
It's amazing you found the
time to drop by, what with your

444
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:21,029
brother's job and all.

445
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:26,416
Uh, Roger is the guy that's
renting the townhouse next door.

446
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,594
Just till November '96.

447
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:33,024
Then I'm buying it.

448
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,812
Listen, I just stopped by 'cause my brother
wanted me to give you this in person.

449
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:42,966
It's an invitation to
the Renaissance weekend.

450
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:45,194
Oh, now you see?

451
00:21:45,206 --> 00:21:47,171
You did get invited.

452
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:50,318
It must have been a big oversight.

453
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:53,960
Oh, thanks so much Roger.

454
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,554
You are a doll.

455
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:57,857
Gee, I saw that gorgious canape-bed

456
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,079
that they were delivering to your townhouse,

457
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:03,045
it looks just like the
one in the Lincoln bedroom.

458
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,571
Not after I paint it white.

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,446
♪

460
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:13,580
Miss Fine, did you... did you
have something to do with this?

461
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:16,845
Oh please, Mr. Sheffield.

462
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:20,325
I can't even get Brighton to put
his dirty underwear in the hamper,

463
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,474
you think I can influence the President
of the United States of America?

464
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:27,990
Meanwhile, I think you
should pick up a corsage.

465
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,917
You're taking out Janet Reno tonight.
