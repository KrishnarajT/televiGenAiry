1
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:05,682
Oh, this is for you.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,184
Your old modeling agency
is having a reunion.

3
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:09,920
Oh, look at that.

4
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:13,891
Boy, you know, I don't know
how I ever lasted as a model.

5
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:17,895
I mean, every week, piling
on all that hair and makeup,

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,632
squishing into those tight clothes.

7
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:26,336
I'll tell you, I don't miss it at all.

8
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:29,206
- That's Ma.
- How do you know?

9
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:31,208
Pie's done.

10
00:00:32,777 --> 00:00:35,712
Oh, Fran, I'm so upset.

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,248
I don't even know how I got here.

12
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:42,085
Well, I see some Ray's pizza sauce,

13
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:46,423
some sauerkraut, and some
sprinkles from Baskin and Robbins.

14
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:50,327
I'd say you took the subway to 59th
Street and walked Lexington Avenue.

15
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,430
Go ahead. Make fun.

16
00:00:53,497 --> 00:00:55,398
Meanwhile, my life is over.

17
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:58,435
Your father is not
attracted to me any more.

18
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:01,704
I even tried surprising
him at the door, naked.

19
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:05,375
Ma, you didn't.

20
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:06,676
I did.

21
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:08,445
Meanwhile, you will never see another

22
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:10,847
Jehovah's Witness in my building again.

23
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:15,986
Ma, why don't you just relax?

24
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:18,055
I'm sure it's just a phase.

25
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:22,725
Honey, we haven't had
relations in two whole weeks.

26
00:01:22,727 --> 00:01:25,395
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks?

27
00:01:25,463 --> 00:01:27,264
Please, tell it to someone who cares.

28
00:01:27,332 --> 00:01:29,933
I'm crying bitter tears over here.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,438
So, I've decided to have
some cosmetic surgery.

30
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,573
I'm having my arms done.

31
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:40,410
Look at this.

32
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:45,915
It's... it's just like tapioca pudding.

33
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:50,253
Ma, that is tapioca pudding.

34
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:39,779

35
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:49,780
Well, you know what, Ma?

36
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:51,748
Not many people would
trust a plastic surgeon

37
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:52,949
whose office is between

38
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:55,151
Miller's Outpost and Hickory Farms.

39
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,688
This doctor did Aunt Ceil,

40
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:02,226
and I think she looks like a work of art.

41
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:03,893
Yeah, Ma, a Picasso.

42
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:10,433
Fran, I'm gonna go pick up
something at Brooks Brothers.

43
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,035
Why? What do you need there?

44
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:13,837
The tie salesman.

45
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:17,740
I'll tell you, if I died tomorrow,

46
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:20,910
I'd feel like I accomplished something.

47
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,079
I'll meet you at the shoe store.

48
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,546
I'm gonna go cruise the
chicks at the Limited.

49
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:26,349
Okay. Oh, B, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

50
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:27,951
Your wallet's sticking out.

51
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,386
All your cash is showing.

52
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:30,587
Oh, no. That's right.

53
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:31,988
That's for when they
tell me to take a hike.

54
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:34,124
I want it to hurt real bad.

55
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:38,795
You want to go with your
sister or your brother?

56
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,064
No. I love a doctor's office.

57
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,233
The smell, the magazines, the drama!

58
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:45,201
It makes me feel so alive.

59
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:49,573
Oh, isn't she adorable?

60
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:52,575
The kid is weird.

61
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,836
Ladies,

62
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,812
I'm Dr. Roberts.

63
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,915
Now, who's the patient?

64
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:33,717
Oh, I like him already.

65
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,621
How old do you think I am?

66
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,357
I don't know. Well, 55?

67
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:44,360
I'm 50.

68
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:48,632
That's because I can't go to me.

69
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:58,007
Doctor, can you make me look like this?

70
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:01,711
Linda Evangelista, Ma? He's not Dr. Bombay.

71
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:05,782
Ladies, nothing is impossible.

72
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:08,085
You have insurance, right?

73
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:09,252
Own your own home?

74
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,187
Now, Ma,

75
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,455
don't get carried away.

76
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:13,924
He's gonna try and talk you into

77
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,391
a bunch of stuff you really don't need.

78
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,127
Now, you're a beautiful woman.

79
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:19,596
I hope when I'm you're
age, I look like you.

80
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:20,630
You will.

81
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:26,703
What do you mean?

82
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,572
Aging is determined by your genes.

83
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,340
Look at the bone
structure, look at the jaw,

84
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,175
look at the eyes, the lips.

85
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:33,510
Behold, the future.

86
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:39,215
Can't something be done?

87
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:41,151
Oh, calm down.

88
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:44,687
That's what I'm here for,
to prevent the inevitable.

89
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:46,656
Chocolate?

90
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,261
Enjoy it today. We can
suck it out tomorrow.

91
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:57,367
Oh, Fran, you've got to read this.

92
00:05:57,435 --> 00:06:00,637
Do you know what happens
when you get as old as you?

93
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,940
You lose your tolerance
for little children?

94
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:07,343
No. Your feet get bigger.

95
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:09,612
Actually, everything keeps growing,

96
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,049
your nose, your ears, your feet.

97
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:14,584
Your tush. It grows like a weed.

98
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:17,988
Yeah. But you can't control that.

99
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:19,555
That's glandular.

100
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,993
There's nothing you can do about glands.

101
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:25,361
You cannot help that.

102
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:26,563
Have another chocolate.

103
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,730
Thank you.

104
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,772
Oh, these are gorgeous.

105
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,842
Oh, I can't afford them.

106
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,211
Fran, you know, we wear the same size.

107
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,579
I can put these on Dad's charge for me,

108
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:46,983
and you could... borrow them.

109
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:49,486
Don't tell the others,
but you're my favorite.

110
00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:54,224
Fran, my feet grew a whole size!

111
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,793
Remember what that doctor said?

112
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:58,127
I'm getting old.

113
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:00,096
I'm turning into your mother!

114
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,403
Sweetie, sweetie, relax.

115
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:11,540
Let's talk about it. I'm here for you.

116
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:13,743
Get me these in a seven.

117
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:17,580
Gracie, getting older can be very exciting.

118
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:23,052
I mean, change and growth could
be something to look forward to.

119
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,422
They're too small. You need an eight.

120
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:28,158
I don't think so.

121
00:07:29,527 --> 00:07:30,694
Miss...

122
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:34,464
They're fine, very comfy, like slippers.

123
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:44,574
Oh, Niles, you don't
know how lucky you are.

124
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:47,643
And, look, you still
got such nice small feet.

125
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:51,747
Say, you know what that means, don't you?

126
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,389
Never mind.

127
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:03,726
In England, we go by the hands.

128
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,200
What you doing, honey?

129
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:14,371
Looking at pictures of
myself when I was young.

130
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:16,439
Look at how tight my skin was.

131
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:19,309
Nothing sagged.

132
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:22,946
Oh, I don't know. Those diapers
look like they're hanging pretty low.

133
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:25,881
Fran, I don't want to get older.

134
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,217
Oh, what are you complaining about?

135
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:30,386
I'm the one with the
size-eight foot in the grave.

136
00:08:30,454 --> 00:08:33,223
Fran, are you a lot older than me?

137
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,625
Well, let's put it this way.

138
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:38,094
When you're 20, I'll be 40.

139
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:40,363
When you're 30, I'll be 40.

140
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:45,502
And when you're 40, you'll
understand why I'm still 40.

141
00:08:47,104 --> 00:08:49,639
It's the new math. Learn it.

142
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:54,110
Miss Fine, did you get shorter?

143
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:56,879
Oh, no. I'm aging, and now I'm shrinking?

144
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:58,481
You know, it's genetic, too.

145
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,951
I had a great-aunt that would
come in through the doggy door.

146
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:06,556
Oh, wait. Look, I'm wearing my slippers.

147
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,324
My feet were killing me.

148
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:11,127
Some stupid salesman
sold me a pair of shoes

149
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,796
that must have been mismarked.

150
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:15,565
Maybe your feet have gotten bigger.

151
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,534
You know, when you get
older, they tend to...

152
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:21,037
I don't think so.

153
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:23,873
Fortunately, the Babcock
women age gracefully.

154
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,109
Well, you've always been a rebel.

155
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:33,583
Miss Fine, everyone's
looks fade eventually.

156
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:37,353
It's... it's what's inside
a person that really matters.

157
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:40,056
What kind of a bizarre
world are you living in?

158
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,593
With age comes wisdom.

159
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:44,494
Yeah. And for a man,

160
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:46,529
wisdom and a 20-year-old bimbo.

161
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:50,066
Well, he didn't say life was fair.

162
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:58,074
I am serious. My foot went up a whole size.

163
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:00,776
And Ma's doctor said that as you get older,

164
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:03,380
your appendages keep growing.

165
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:05,548
More good news for men.

166
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:12,355
Why are women so vain?

167
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:15,125
Oh, I guess you're right.

168
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:16,926
I mean, look, you're not
the least bit concerned

169
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:20,397
about that little bald spot right
there on the back of your head.

170
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,698
What?

171
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:24,667
Oh, you know, it's nothing. Nothing.

172
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:26,435
Just, well, when you go out in the sun,

173
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:29,405
you might want to smear a little
Coppertone on it. That's all.

174
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,207
Stop! Get me a mirror. Quick! Quick!

175
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:32,875
- Get a mirror.
- Oh, would you relax?

176
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:36,046
Wasn't it you that just said
it's what's inside that counts?

177
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,848
I was talking about you. Not me!

178
00:10:38,915 --> 00:10:40,650
Do... do you know why I'm successful?

179
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,918
I mean, anyone can throw on a revival,

180
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:44,721
drag out some old musical,

181
00:10:44,788 --> 00:10:50,092
but people want to do business
with me because I'm, well, cute.

182
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:54,497
Big bushy hair, English accent.

183
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:57,300
I'm a one-man mop-top
British Invasion.

184
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,804
Down, Ringo.

185
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,639
Meanwhile, I'm the one that's got
to go to the big modeling reunion

186
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:05,341
with these clodhoppers.

187
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:08,211
Oh, Miss Fine, come on,
you're a beautiful woman.

188
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:10,447
No one's gonna be looking at your feet.

189
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:13,783
Oh, yeah? I was a foot model.

190
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:15,718
I haven't seen these girls in 10 years.

191
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:19,088
I don't want them to see
how time has ravaged me.

192
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:24,160
I mean, we are talking about
mean, backstabbing, vicious women.

193
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:25,862
Then why are you going?

194
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:28,364
'Cause they're my friends.

195
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:45,881
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I am so thankful

196
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,053
that you insisted on
bringing me to this reunion.

197
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,621
Anyway, that's the story if anyone asks.

198
00:11:53,757 --> 00:11:56,459
Oh, look, that's me.

199
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:57,660
Oh, my goodness!

200
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,096
Miss Fine, I had no idea
you were in that commercial

201
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:02,198
where the women played basketball in heels.

202
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:05,468
Oh, yeah. Although, after
eight hours on that court,

203
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:06,936
they may have looked like a pump,

204
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:10,172
but they stunk like a sneaker.

205
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,609
- So, are you a little more relaxed now?
- Mmm.

206
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:15,445
You know, you are by far the
most beautiful woman in the room.

207
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:17,847
Oh, how sweet.

208
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:22,018
Good reading. A little
louder. Nobody heard you.

209
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:26,088
Ladies, can we all get
together for a group shot?

210
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:27,991
Oh, hide me. Hide me.

211
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:29,825
I don't want to take any pictures.

212
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:31,527
Fran, you look gorgeous.

213
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:33,296
You haven't changed a bit.

214
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:36,332
Girls, girls, pictures, pictures. Come on.

215
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:40,503
Okay, ladies, lift those dresses.

216
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,538
Let's see some feet.

217
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:48,144
What? What?

218
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:58,087
No!

219
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,625
No. No. No. No.

220
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,662
Miss Fine. Miss Fine. Wake up.

221
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,900
Were you having that
Streisand's retiring dream again?

222
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:14,203
No. No. I... and don't even say that.

223
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,339
It puts it out there.

224
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:19,609
Miss Fine, you're shaking. Calm down.

225
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:22,145
Oh, I dreamt about the reunion.

226
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:23,813
I went, as planned.

227
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,782
I looked gorgeous, as planned.

228
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,218
I was even five pounds thinner,

229
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,688
just a little bonus from my subconscious.

230
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:37,360
Then I looked down at my
feet and they were huge.

231
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:42,465
Oh, Miss Fine, your...
your feet are beautiful.

232
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,701
You are beautiful.

233
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:47,537
Oh, Mr. Sheffield... huh?

234
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,512
Miss Fine, the children all
have plans for this evening.

235
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:02,819
You're telling me this because...

236
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:06,189
Which... which leaves you and me free.

237
00:14:06,256 --> 00:14:07,857
To?

238
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:29,478
Fran. Oh, Fran, Fran...

239
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:35,451
Fran, Fran, Fran.

240
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,220
Oh, no. Ma!

241
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:40,590
Go away. I've got to get back to sleep.

242
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:44,026
Fran, this is very important.

243
00:14:44,094 --> 00:14:46,963
Ma, believe me, this is
both our dreams coming true.

244
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,598
Go away.

245
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,469
Fran, wake up. I have wonderful news.

246
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:55,571
I'm not having my arms done.

247
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,643
I've decided to grow old
gracefully, with dignity and honor.

248
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,645
The insurance didn't cover it?

249
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:05,347
No.

250
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,053
Daddy's policy doesn't
cover elective surgery.

251
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,389
I have to be in our home

252
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,725
and run over by farm equipment.

253
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:21,431
You know, Ma, I'd love to sit
here and talk to you all day,

254
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:24,333
but I've got something very important

255
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:27,069
that I've got to finish. Good night.

256
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,979
Niles, that bloody drain in my
bathroom's all stopped up again.

257
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:39,115
Isn't it your job to keep it clean?

258
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:41,617
Oh, sir, I don't think of it as just a job.

259
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:43,519
It's more like a calling.

260
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:47,623
Well, how about calling a bloody plumber

261
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,459
to find out what's clogging it?

262
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,694
What do you think is clogging it, sir?

263
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:57,667
Just off the top of your head?

264
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:05,674
I am not losing my hair!

265
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:07,276
Oh, of course not, sir.

266
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:11,780
It's thick and luxurious and does
that great flippy thing in the front.

267
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,883
Can it, Niles. I'm not in
the mood for cheap flattery.

268
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:17,052
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I was just thinking

269
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,722
that it's looking like Pierce Brosnan's.

270
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:23,559
Really?

271
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:26,295
You know, a couple of
people have told me that.

272
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:29,865
Because, you know, I
think Miss Fine made it up

273
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:31,500
that your hair is thinning

274
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:33,902
because you weren't
sympathetic to her problem.

275
00:16:33,904 --> 00:16:38,741
That's because she doesn't
have a bloody problem!

276
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,643
Look, Niles, she's a
young, beautiful woman.

277
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:43,279
What do I have to do to
convince her she's desirable?

278
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:46,148
Oh, sir, I'm sure you'll
think of something.

279
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:49,652
I mean, after all, you're
a man, she's a woman.

280
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:51,721
Fill in the blanks.

281
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,192
The children are at school.

282
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:58,127
She's lying on the sofa.

283
00:16:58,194 --> 00:16:59,729
And if all else fails,

284
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:02,765
what would Pierce Brosnan do?

285
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,708
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, wake up.

286
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,957
Oh, good. It worked. I'm back.

287
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:30,159
Miss Fine,

288
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:32,962
did you pick up my blue
suit from the cleaners?

289
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,733
Mr. Sheffield, I'm sorry.

290
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:41,136
I... I... I don't usually
sleep during the day.

291
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:44,440
Well, yeah, I do, but you
don't usually catch me.

292
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,409
Miss Fine, I don't know

293
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,946
what you're so upset
about this reunion for.

294
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:53,382
You have absolutely nothing to worry about.

295
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,285
Your feet are beautiful.

296
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:59,422
You are beautiful.

297
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:01,891
Oh, Mr. Sheffield... huh?

298
00:18:03,927 --> 00:18:07,696
You know, the children all
have plans for this evening.

299
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:09,665
Oh, my God!

300
00:18:11,935 --> 00:18:13,202
Wait a minute.

301
00:18:16,606 --> 00:18:19,107
Okay. Go ahead.

302
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:21,744
I just thought, with the house empty,

303
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,480
that would leave you and me free to...

304
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:25,614
To?

305
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,651
To go to the reunion together.

306
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,185
The reunion?

307
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:31,687
That's not the way it went.

308
00:18:31,755 --> 00:18:33,188
Go back! Go back!

309
00:18:34,324 --> 00:18:36,492
Fran. Fran.

310
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,460
Not that far. Not that far.

311
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:20,135
Oh, it's a beautiful night, isn't it?

312
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:22,938
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'm so glad we didn't go right in.

313
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:26,308
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, thank you so
much for taking me to the reunion.

314
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,177
I had a fabulous time.

315
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:30,345
I did, too.

316
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,347
Did you know all your girlfriends
are under the impression

317
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,116
that I was your husband?

318
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:37,086
Gee, I wonder what kind of a nut

319
00:19:37,153 --> 00:19:39,989
would spread a rumor like that?

320
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:42,892
Isn't it amazing how old everybody looked?

321
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,194
And yet I look exactly the same.

322
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:47,663
I know what you mean. You know,

323
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:49,499
every morning when I look in the mirror,

324
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:51,801
I still see the face of a man in his 20s.

325
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:53,735
That's funny.

326
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:55,237
Every morning when I look in the mirror,

327
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:58,707
I hope to see the face of a man in his 20s.

328
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:01,610
Oh, let's face it, Miss
Fine, age is irrelevant.

329
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:04,013
It's just a state of mind.

330
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,647
Absolutely.

331
00:20:05,715 --> 00:20:07,883
It's how young you feel that counts.

332
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,427
Maxwell!

333
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:27,136
C.C., what on earth...

334
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:28,571
What?

335
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:31,206
I... I wasn't, uh, waiting up to see

336
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:32,708
what time you two got home.

337
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:35,010
I... I just stopped by...

338
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:38,080
after the...

339
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,081
Theater.

340
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:40,850
Yes.

341
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,084
Where I saw...

342
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:43,452
Victor/Victoria.

343
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,587
Right.

344
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:50,359
Well, I have to run. I have a date.

345
00:20:55,198 --> 00:20:56,966
I hope it's in the Village.

346
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,639
Oh, hello, sweetheart,
what are you doing still up?

347
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:07,209
I can't sleep. I'm obsessing
about getting old and dying.

348
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:12,881
Oh, sweetie, that's not gonna
happen for a very long time.

349
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:14,750
Not me. You.

350
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:19,221
Me? Oh, honey.

351
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,524
I'm not going anywhere until
I've got a house in Great Neck,

352
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:23,992
a couple of kids,

353
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,029
and a husband waiting outside
the Loehmann's dressing room.

354
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:29,365
See, sweetheart? She'll be here forever.

355
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:44,366
