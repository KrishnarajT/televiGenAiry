Brighton, you're missing
the whole meaning
of Christmas.

I know what it means.

Two weeks off from school.

58
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,040
No, Brighton.
It's about giving of oneself.

59
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,540
Yeah. The gift part
is totally meaningless.

60

We're going down to
the homeless shelter

63
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,750
and feed some of
the less fortunate.

64
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,250
You're gonna learn
what it feels like

65
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,760
to give of oneself,
if it kills you.

66
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,400

really does hold.

Picture this.

87
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,450
Inhaling
way too much hairspray,
suddenly hears dogs talking.

It's the worst storm ever.

is out to destroy Christmas.

00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,400
Oh, so I guess
it's okay

93
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,970
for the snowman
to say a few words,

94
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,410
but God forbid,
the dog gets
a little chatty,

95
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,980
and I'm ready
for the loony bin.

Yeah. It's so warm and cozy.

103
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,810
You know, it's like
being back in the womb,

104
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,310
if your mother
was a chocolate bunny.

105
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,820
Brighton, see that
big white raft? Grab it!

106
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,720
This isn't a raft.
It's a marshmallow!

We have to stay calm.

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,690
And this is
Chester and Brighton.

179
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,690
Isn't that sweet?

180
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,760
He's bringing back
all that candy
for his sisters.

181
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,260
Yeah, right.

182
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,770
Santa,
he just doesn't know
the meaning of sharing.

183
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,270
It's like my mother
with a lamb chop bone.

184
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,270
She's like Cujo
with that marrow.

185
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,840
Fran, you don't believe
this is really Santa?

186
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,610
Well, Elfis, it seems like
we have a non-believer.

187
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,120

Elfis has left the building.

211
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,790
Brighton, you can't take
all those toys home.

212
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,130
It's all right.
He said he's gonna share them
with his three best friends.

213
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,230
Yeah. Me, myself, and I.

214
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,660
Not to be a buttinsky, Santa,
but look at the time.

215
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,730
When are you gonna start
delivering all the toys?

216
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,770
Unfortunately,
with this storm blowing up,

217
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,270
there won't be any
delivery this year.

218
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,280
I think C.C.,
the Abominable Babcock,

219
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,450
has finally found a way
to cancel Christmas.

(ALL GASPS)

221
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,780
And she gets like this
every 28 years?

222
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,780
She's very regular.

223
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,290
It's so sad.

224
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,790
I just can't imagine
a world without Christmas.

225
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,790
What will we do?

226
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,990
No Christmas.

227
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,000
Wait!
If there's no Christmas,

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
there's no
after-Christmas sales.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,470
Well, I am certainly
not going to let

230
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,500
that cranky cloud
cancel this holiday.

231
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,570

Look, there's
the ice palace.

234

Oh, I can't believe
I have to save Christmas.

235
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,590
Five minutes ago
we were in a warm castle.

236
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,290
I was about to
watch The Shaggy D.A.

237
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,300
Where's your courage?

238
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,300
Where's your compassion?

239
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Listen to me.
I'm looking for
a test of character

240
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,310
from someone who drinks
out of a toilet.

241
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,110
Look at that!
She left the window opened.

242
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,110
Well, I guess she isn't
worried about a draught.

243
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,680
Oh! Oy!

244
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,190
You see, I figure
she's got a whole

solar depravation
thing happening,

246
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,690
you know, cranky 'cause
she doesn't get enough sun.

247
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,200
Well, if I turn up
the thermostat
and warm her up,

248
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
she'll be in a good mood.

249
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,270
Now, Chester,
you're my lookout.

250
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,640
Just whistle
if you see anything.

251

00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,660

268
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,390
She did.

is blowing up,

I won't be able to
ride my sleigh tonight.

here a day or two,

my next waxing appointment

want the Abominable

nothing to celebrate!

sees in her anyway.

secret admirer?

this secret admirer be?

Well, honey,
he's very cute,

317
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,360

and he's a weather

who are so desperate.

Now, I am going to
introduce you to him,

323
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,850
but only if you promise
that you'll stop trying
to destroy Christmas.

324
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,950
All right. I promise.

325
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,580
None of this cranky business,
or I'm never fixing you up
again.

326
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,650
I swear I'll be moderate
with my weather patterns.

327
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,220
Now introduce us.
The suspense is killing me.

328
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,190

Yeah, definitely rain.
Definitely raining.

Hello. Could I interest you
in a little stroll
around the planet?

Oh, Fran, that was so cool.
It worked. It's a miracle.

341
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,870
Honey, now that is what
Christmas is all about.

342
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,380
You give with your heart,
you help the less fortunate,

343
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
and you offer
your friendship.

344

out the wrong end.

take rides from strangers.

00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,860
Oh, look,
you put on your costume.

350
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,830
On you it works.

351
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,370
Ho! Ho! Ho!

352
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,540
Wow! The actual reindeer.

353
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,510
Hi, doll. I'm Dancer.

354
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,040
♪ Baby, remember my name,
remember... ♪

355
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,040
All right. Cut it out.

356
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,150
Are you Blitzen?
It's Blintzes.

357
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,520
Who else are they gonna get
to work on Christmas Eve?

358
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,580
You know,
Rudolph's a little
under the weather.

359
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,090
Chester, would you
lead my sleigh tonight?

360
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,090
Hi. I'm Vixen, and I'm
a sucker for a fly boy.

361
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,860
What do you say?

362
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,060
I say we have some
toys to deliver, woman.

363
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,710
FRAN: I've got
the perfect ensemble
for just this occasion.

364
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,760
It's strange
that no one's left you
any cookies this year.

365
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Yes. Very strange.

366
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,270
What? I'm not even
getting minimum wage.

367
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,960
Whoa!

368
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,530
Brighton,
it's the homeless shelter.

369
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,740
Look, it's Santa!

370
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,300
Well, this is
our last stop.

371
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,770
Woops!

372
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,810
We have a problem.

373
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,810
I seem to have
miscalculated.

374
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,610
I'm short a few presents.

375
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:29,690
You know,
the man has nothing
to do for 364 days.

376
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,850
Boys and girls,

377
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,320
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

378
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,730
Unfortunately...
Wait, Santa.

379
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,300
You forgot about
these presents.

380
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Oh, Brighton,
that's so sweet.

381
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,800
Those were the toys
you so selfishly hoarded

382
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,840
the whole time
we were in the North Pole.

383
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,410
I know. But I've got
plenty of toys at home.

384
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,410
And us kids,
we have to look
out for each other.

385
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,940
Brighton, you're making me
all verklempt.

386
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,780
FRAN: Oh, what a day.

387
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,450
I can't believe
I'm driving Santa's sleigh.

388
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:04,950
What an upper.

389
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,620
It's my way of thanking you
for saving Christmas.

390
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,090
Oh, Santa, please,
it's nothing.

391
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,630
But between you and me,
I might have ended up
on your naughty list.

392
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,130
If you wouldn't mind
erasing my name...

393
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,140
Deal.

394
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,570
Woops!

395
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:25,570
Whoa!

396
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,780
Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!

397
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,850
Daddy, there they are.

398
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,850
Are you okay?

399
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,950
Miss Fine, are you all right?

400
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,060
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

401
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,560
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
you won't believe
the day I had.

402
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,630
First, I saved Christmas,
and then I drove the sleigh.

403
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,130
Tell them, Brighton.

404
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,130
Frostbite.

405
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,440
Stop it! Brighton,
don't you remember
anything?

406
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,010
The last thing I remember,

407
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,010
we were on our way
to the homeless shelter,

408
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,510
you got hit in the head,
and we got caught in
a blizzard.

409
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,540
Hey, we gotta go.
It's closing soon.

410
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,450
What's your rush
all of a sudden?

411
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,020
Don't you know
what Christmas
is all about?

412
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,450
We kids have to look
out for each other.

413
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,450
I'm sure you're just
a little shook up.

414
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,120
Let's go inside
and get our coats.

415
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,630
And perhaps we'll all go
to the homeless shelter.

416
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,630
I guess it was a dream.

417
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,630
Jewish reindeer,
candy castles,
dogs talking.

418
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,630
Of course
it was a dream.

419
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,640
You ate all that chocolate
and your pants still fit.

420
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,570
Oh, right.

421
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,570
Hello!

422
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,650
Okay. The first thing we do
is book you on Letterman.

423
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,650
You know, I'm very tight
with Paul Shaffer.

424
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,150
He's a cousin.

425
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,650
Well, my neighbor's cousin.

426
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,150
But who's counting?
