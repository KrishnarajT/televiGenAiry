1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:04,720
Concede Brighton. I've
got you in two moves.

2
00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:06,206
You're done.

3
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:10,491
Finished. Toast.

4
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:15,863
Sir, when it's time to choose who
pulls the plug on the life support,

5
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,638
go with the girls.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,167
Ma! Jules' gonna be here in two minutes.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,254
Would you stop fussing with my skirt.

8
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:25,677
Can you believe her? Stop it!

9
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:28,087
Oh, Miss Fine, she's a mother.
She's just pulling it down.

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,433
She's my mother. She's hiking it up.

11
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,334
Oh, I get it.

12
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:36,212
Preparing the virgin for
the big sacrifice, huh?

13
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,661
- Yeah, if it was 1980.
- Ma.

14
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:45,309
Meanwhile, show some, uh, decolletessen.

15
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:47,177
Stop it, ma.

16
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:53,238
I'm not some over-the-hill
hussy, desperate, uh...

17
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:55,162
Oh, how's this?

18
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,373
Now, aren't you glad I forced
you to go to the Hadassah hoedown?

19
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:02,639
Yeah.

20
00:01:03,327 --> 00:01:05,251
Yeah. I am.

21
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:09,162
She thought that you could
meet the man of her dreams

22
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,438
hanging around gay bars.

23
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:15,630
Ma, I said Zabaar's.

24
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:18,672
I'm getting you a miracle ear.

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,980
Hurry up, Miss Fine.

26
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:23,482
You're not getting any younger.

27
00:01:23,982 --> 00:01:27,017
I'm not the one that
looks like Lily Munster.

28
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:32,241
Meanwhile, I just met the man a week ago.

29
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:34,150
It takes a while to form a relationship.

30
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:36,027
I don't even know if we're compatible.

31
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,240
You know, he's a doctor.

32
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:50,643
Ah, that explains why he's
trying to remove her tonsils.

33
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,303
Oh, can you believe this.

34
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:57,909
Ever since The Beatles, I've wanted to
meet a sexy guy with an English accent.

35
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,475
Guess that rule out the Hadassah hoedown.

36
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:05,698
Meanwhile, you should've come. There
was a lot of nice girls there for you.

37
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:10,008
Big hair, lots of makeup, tight
clothes... not my style. But...

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,548
he goes for that type.

39
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:14,614
Jules, before I forget,

40
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,624
come for dinner Sunday.

41
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:19,838

00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:23,737
Oh, Maxwell.

59
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,095
I can barely keep my eyes open.

60
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:27,617
I have got to get out of here.

61
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:31,090
C.C., do you believe
in love at first sight?

62
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:32,826
Yes! Why?

63
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,336
Miss Fine.

64
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:35,665
No! Why?

65
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:36,713
She met a gentleman.

66
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,668
I mean, yes. Yes. Yes.

67
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,209
I'll stick with yes.

68
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,102
They spend every waking moment together.

69
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:45,839
- It's just not...
- Fair, sir?

70
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,844
What I was going to say
before my... back off...

71
00:03:49,867 --> 00:03:52,104
butler interrupted was...

72
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:53,519
she's only just met the man.

73
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:55,631
It's all happening so fast.

74
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,734
That's why the lady is a tramp.

75
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,763
- Coffee?
- Yes. Please.

76
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:03,921
Aah ow!

77
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:06,901
Knock, knock.

78
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:08,363
Mr. Sheffield, you wanted to see me?

79
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:10,702
Ah, yes, Miss Fine,
Grace's school telephoned.

80
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:13,853
Apparently, she's coming home
with a head full of chocolate cake.

81
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,793
Don't worry. That'll come right out.

82
00:04:15,808 --> 00:04:18,420
I'll just take it to my mother's
weight watchers' meeting.

83
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:23,622
Miss Fine, aren't you disturbed
that there's a boy in Grace's class

84
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,522
who's pummeling her with food every day?

85
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,971
No. Boys throw food to
relieve sexual tension,

86
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:31,685
unlike girls, who just stuff their faces.

87
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:35,963
Please, that is such a fallacy.

88
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,703
Well, if you don't need me anymore,

89
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:43,721
Jules is taking me to a matinee.

90
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:45,754
Do you want me to bring
you home some bonbons?

91
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:48,210
Thought so.

92
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,102
Ah, the theater.

93
00:04:50,134 --> 00:04:52,816
Well, that's something you don't
get a lot of that around here.

94
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:54,411
What are you gonna see?

95
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,171
Oh, I forget the title.

96
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,283
It's got cleaning fluids in it though.

97
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:02,405
Formula 409, comet, lysol?

98
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:04,368
- The Fantasticks.
- Yeah. That's it.

99
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:08,309
You want to meet him, Miss Babcock?

100
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,164
Oh, Nanny Fine, I'd love to meet the man

101
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:13,658
who's taking you away from Max... huh...

102
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:16,184
Millian... Schell...

103
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,420
Oil.

104
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,610
Oh, nice save.

105
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:25,537
Well, I'll go get him.

106
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,305
He's right outside, he's
playing chess with Brighton,

107
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,440
it's so cute the way he lets him win.

108
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,598
He's gonna make a great father someday.

109
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,451
Wait a minute.

110
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:35,876
If Nanny Fine's boyfriend is here,

111
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,393
who's in the chicken
suit at the Padres game?

112
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:40,958
Ha ha ha.

113
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,470
Ha ha ha. Oh, ho ho.

114
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:47,465
He's gorgeous.

115
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:50,586
Oh, cheer up. Perhaps he
brought a friend for you.

116
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:56,874
No.

117
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,786
C.C? M.D.

118
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,039
- M & M?
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:06,909
So, Jules...

120
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,936
had I known you were going to the
theater, I would've gotten you house seats.

121
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,805
- I know the star.
- I know the producer.

122
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,346
- I know the director.
- I know the theater owner.

123
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:14,597
I talked to God.

124
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:18,890
Jules, put that back in your pants.

125
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,837
I can't stand to see two grown men

126
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:23,363
fight about who's got
the biggest connection.

127
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:41,226
Please, Sylvia, why...
why don't you join us?

128
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:44,832
Oh no, I just came over to
see how Fran's date went.

129
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,272
Make like I'm not even here.

130
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,777
Are you sure we can't offer you something?

131
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:54,952
Oh, no, thank you.

132
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:58,010
I had a Yoplait this morning around 10:30.

133
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:05,447
Oh, such a big potato
for such a little girl.

134
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:09,569
Look at the time.

135
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:13,073
They must be having a ball.

136
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:14,966
I'm going to go in the kitchen.

137
00:07:14,989 --> 00:07:18,360
I need a meat to wash this down with.

138
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,600
I don't know about you
guys, but I like Jules.

139
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,868
And he has yet to beat me in chess.

140
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:28,550
Oh God, Brighton. He throws every game.

141
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:30,841
Do you see how easy it is to bond?

142
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,199
Well, I wouldn't get too attached
to the bloke if I were you.

143
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:39,763
We all know Miss Fine relationships
eventually end in disaster.

144
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:44,513
He asked me to marry him.

145
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:46,640
Right on the money as always, sir.

146
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,860
That is so cool, Fran.

147
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:49,088
Congratulations.

148
00:07:49,104 --> 00:07:50,950
I know. I can't believe it.

149
00:07:50,957 --> 00:07:54,610
I'm so excited I couldn't
eat a... ooh, kielbasa.

150
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:56,455
Sweet and sour cabbage.

151
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:57,628
Hit me again.

152
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:00,796
Ooh, such a big corn
for such a little girl.

153
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:03,158
He asked you to marry him?

154
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,854
Uh-huh.

155
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,856
You've known the man for two weeks.

156
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,814
What, you think it's so hard to believe

157
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:10,606
a man would fall in love with me that fast?

158
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,683
Yeah, Todd and I knew
each other three minutes

159
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,990
before I got a pudding pack in the eye.

160
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:18,033
Look, you know nothing about this man.

161
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:20,136
All right, so he's a doctor.

162
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:21,919
Is he a specialist?

163
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:26,987
You ain't just whistling Dixie, baby.

164
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:29,332
Oh, God.

165
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, this is so exciting.
So can I be a bridesmaid?

166
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:36,035
I know the doctor asked me to marry him,

167
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,788
but I didn't say yes.

168
00:08:42,644 --> 00:08:44,959
This is delicious.

169
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,901
Why don't you grab a knife and
stick it straight through my heart?

170
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,677
Ha ha! That was great.

171
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:54,219
She sounded just like... ma!

172
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:56,666
Ma, let go of my ankle!

173
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:58,926
You'd better run.

174
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:00,600
Brighton, is she taking off her shoe?

175
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,422
No, but she's gonna hurl a corn.

176
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:06,583
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

177
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:12,323
Ma, put down the vegetable

178
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,466
and no one gets hurt.

179
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:19,664
All right.

180
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,817
Help me to understand.

181
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,882
Which was the biggest turnoff...

182
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:26,158
the fact that Jules was gorgeous,

183
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:28,699
rich, or a doctor?

184
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:32,187
Did I mention he was Jewish?

185
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,599
Darling, I only say
this because I love you.

186
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:40,438
You're a glorified cleaning girl.

187
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,092
This could be your last chance.

188
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:48,744
Oh, ma. I didn't say no.

189
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,762
I just said I'd think about it.

190
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:53,874
Ok. I did.

191
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,009
You mean, I do.

192
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:58,558
- Yeah.
- Oh.

193
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,895
Ma, you may kiss the bride.

194
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:06,565
You know Miss Fine, I think you're
very wise not to rush into this.

195
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:10,164
You're far too sensible a woman
to marry a man you just... ow!

196
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:12,526
Oh, I'm sorry.

197
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,730
Did this fork accidentally
puncture your tuchus?

198
00:10:32,225 --> 00:10:33,640
Sweetheart, I want you to have

199
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:36,173
the most beautiful engagement
ring that money can buy.

200
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:37,730
Oh, Julesie.

201
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,247
I don't know if I could
go through with this.

202
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:42,484
- Getting married?
- No.

203
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:44,072
Buying retail.

204
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:45,964
Let's go.

205
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:49,608
Now, you know, Jules, I'm a
simple girl with simple tastes.

206
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,493
I just want a simple ring.

207
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,518
That's a nice little stone.

208
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:56,608
Madam, that's a crystal ashtray.

209
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:02,903
I was talking about the shape,

210
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:05,992
like the shape of that
crystal pineapple over there.

211
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:07,306
No. That's a ring.

212
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:08,307
Whip it out, honey.

213
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,334
Ooh.

214
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,867
You know I think that's a little too small.

215
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,713
We don't wanna see
anything less than 5 karats.

216
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,832
5 karats?

217
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:19,475
What's up, doc?

218
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:23,056
This one is 5.2.

219
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:25,246
Uh, we could take off 10%.

220
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:28,108
That would make the price $50,000.

221
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,891
Ooh, a haggler.

222
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:31,299
Now we're talking my language.

223
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,488
Offer her 10.

224
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,900
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

225
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,597
I'm not too crazy about it.

226
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,169
It's a little cloudy.

227
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,055
But, sir, the stone is exquisite.

228
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:46,518
Uh, I agree with you, honey.

229
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:51,680
I think I preferred the one
we saw at van Cleef and hormel.

230
00:11:54,035 --> 00:11:56,475
I'm sorry. This just doesn't sparkle.

231
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,039
It sparkles plenty.

232
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,721
Take it outside in the sun.
It'll blind you... your...

233
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:01,941
sir.

234
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:06,164
I'll be right back.

235
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:09,097
I shall leave you my little jewel.

236
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,828
So, when's the big event?

237
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,619
Whaouh...

238
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:17,339
If he buys this ring, I'll tell you,

239
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:19,842
he could get lucky in just a few...

240
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:24,089
Oh, you meant the wedding date.

241
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:28,688
Oh, actually, we haven't
talked about setting a date yet.

242
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:30,799
Wh... where's your fiancé?

243
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,403
- Oh, I'll get him.
- Ma'am, stay where you are, please.

244
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:35,452
- Why? He's probably right outside.
- Guard!

245
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:36,892
What's the matter?

246
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,246
He probably went to put money in the meter.

247
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,967
Oh, no. We don't have a car!

248
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:43,813
He's gone.

249
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,416
I'll call the police. You hold her.

250
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:49,460
Oh Jules, how could you do this to me?

251
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:51,853
He's a doctor. He didn't need the money.

252
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,052
Hillary's health plan didn't go through!

253
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:03,974
Oh, I can't believe this is happening.

254
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,868
He got along so well with my parents.

255
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:09,926
He wanted them to move in with us.

256
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:12,264
Well, that should've
tipped me off right there.

257
00:13:14,204 --> 00:13:17,238
We've been looking for Jules
Kimble for over three years.

258
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:19,240
Dr. Kimble is a fugitive?

259
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:20,992
What are the odds?

260
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:26,185
He is not a doctor, Miss Fine.

261
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,609
Really?

262
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:31,238
So when he lanced my mother's
boil, it was just for fun?

263
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:36,563
Miss Fine, I don't want
to say I told you so,

264
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,714
but I never trusted the man.

265
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:41,834
You know, I can spot a
con artist a mile off.

266
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:45,956
This from a man who paid me time and
a half to work on Hebrew national day.

267
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,103
Why me?

268
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:54,480
He usually preys on women over 30.

269
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:57,507
You know, single, desperate, lonely.

270
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,386
Like I said, why me?

271
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,606
Oh, Miss Fine. Cheer up.

272
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,781
This isn't the stupidest
thing you've ever done.

273
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,285
Well, that's true.

274
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:20,250
The stupidest thing I ever
did was windexing your monet.

275
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:24,661
Or should I say your mon?

276
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:29,166
Miss Fine, this came for you.

277
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:33,389
Oh, an engagement present.

278
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,711
How humiliating.

279
00:14:35,954 --> 00:14:38,464
Just put it upstairs with the rest of them.

280
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:47,162
Where is she? Where's my baby?

281
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:50,524
I rushed over as soon
as they finished my hair.

282
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,340
Mommy!

283
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,494
I just hope the police
find that creep before I do.

284
00:14:56,614 --> 00:14:58,613
My Francine is not desperate.

285
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,701
She can have any man she wants.

286
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:02,047
Awww.

287
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,854
But not forever, so don't let yourself go.

288
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:08,851
Ma! This is all her fault.

289
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,141
Ever since I was a little girl,

290
00:15:10,165 --> 00:15:12,260
she's always pushing me to get married.

291
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,731
I never pushed.

292
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:19,558
When I was a little girl,
every affair we'd go to,

293
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,216
she'd throw the centerpiece at me

294
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:24,141
and say "here, think fast".

295
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:26,424
Miss Fine, I'm sure your
mother only meant well.

296
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:29,139
- Well...
- Yeah, they always do.

297
00:15:29,414 --> 00:15:31,767
Like when they stop you from
pursuing a singing career

298
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:33,125
to follow in your father's footsteps

299
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,014
as a subservient slave.

300
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:39,832
And loving every minute of it, sir.

301
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:43,786
Now, Sylvia, if truth be told,

302
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,440
I think you were a little more gung-ho
about this marriage than Miss... ow!

303
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:50,831
Damn! I broke my nail!

304
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,446
I'll leave you two alone.

305
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:58,645
I can't believe I lost my
figure for the likes of you.

306
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,287
You lost your figure for
the likes of Winchell's, ma.

307
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:06,978
I have low blood sugar.

308
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:09,418
The doctor prescribed donuts.

309
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,210
And who prescribed the ice cream floats?

310
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:14,236
Dr. Pepper?

311
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:18,271
Fran, I can hear you all the way upstairs.

312
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,599
Oh, her voice travels.

313
00:16:20,592 --> 00:16:22,852
Honey, I'm sorry. Go up to your room.

314
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:25,648
Ok, but you have some major
issues with your mother

315
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,763
stemming from your failure to live up

316
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,614
to her expectations.

317
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,423
Come back here. Come back here.

318
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,020
Can you believe how advanced she is?

319
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,748
When I was her age, I was
hanging bagels from my ears

320
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:38,286
playing princess Leia.

321
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,565
I think you need some therapy.

322
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,812
No. She'll never change.

323
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:48,089
I meant together.

324
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,997
Now, let's see.

325
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:51,993
Who would be good for you?

326
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,384
My doctor's too cerebral.

327
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:58,762
Dr. Lehrman?

328
00:16:58,762 --> 00:17:00,664
Nah, his couch is too itchy.

329
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,522
Oh forget it, sweetheart.

330
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:04,074
I'm not the type of person

331
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:05,851
that can lie on a couch

332
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:09,198
and cry and scream
about how miserable I am.

333
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:10,693
Please.

334
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:12,282
Put a lean cuisine on your lap

335
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:14,941
and 400 almond joy
wrappers under the cushions

336
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:16,005
and you'd be home.

337
00:17:22,368 --> 00:17:24,183
So ladies, what brings you to therapy?

338
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:27,230
Well, I came because my
mother has an obsession

339
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,919
with me getting married.

340
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,027
I came

341
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:32,504
because my daughter

342
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,106
has a delusion that I have an obsession.

343
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,741
I came because they brought me

344
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,801
and I don't know how to get home from here.

345
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,990
Meanwhile, for 100 bucks a session,

346
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:52,231
she could've put out some
coffee and some nilla wafers.

347
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:54,502
Ma, brush yourself off.

348
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,479
You look like a veal cutlet.

349
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:00,051
Look, at a certain point,

350
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,559
I believe a daughter

351
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,280
has to stop blaming her
mother for everything.

352
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,176
This is your fault.

353
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,841
Me? Yeah.

354
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:11,175
You're the one who kept
pushing me to have children.

355
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:12,745
They're nothing but heartache.

356
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,297
That's right, cookie.

357
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,519
It's payback time.

358
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,074
You seem to be harboring
a lot of hostility.

359
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:23,363
Who?

360
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,298
Don't nag the kid all the time.

361
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:30,113
She should get married when she wants to.

362
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:32,284
Not just 'cause she got knocked up

363
00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:34,386
by the seltzer man like I...

364
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:44,504
like I heard people do.

365
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,038
Ma!

366
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,609
Is that why I love egg cream?

367
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:55,059
Oh, ma. Buy your own hour.

368
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:57,174
This one is for me, right?

369
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:58,206
Huh?

370
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:00,296
Sorry. I drifted off.

371
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:02,429
Oh, that's not your fault.

372
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,277
Most people say our
voices are very soothing.

373
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:07,141
- Yeah I get that a lot.
- That's true.

374
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,299
All the time.

375
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,442
Frannie, all I ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

376
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:16,351
I just want you to have a full life.

377
00:19:16,663 --> 00:19:20,311
You don't have to be married
to have a full life, ma.

378
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:22,662
Sure, I'd like to someday,

379
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,951
but if I don't,

380
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:27,054
it doesn't mean my life was worthless,

381
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:28,800
right?

382
00:19:30,401 --> 00:19:31,953
Right?

383
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,499
Right?

384
00:19:35,894 --> 00:19:37,346
Right.

385
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,882
I know you think I'm not all there.

386
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,516
But in my day,

387
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:49,858
we didn't air our dirty laundry in public.

388
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,018
Welcome to the eighties.

389
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:01,502
Hi, kids.

390
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:04,336
Fran, whatever you do, do not
let Gracie touch this board.

391
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:05,568
It's your move, dad!

392
00:20:05,543 --> 00:20:07,602
Oh, you beat your father.

393
00:20:07,589 --> 00:20:09,247
All right, B.

394
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,561
Ooh ooh ooh.

395
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,363
Look what you did, Gracie!

396
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:17,024
Fran, I have to break up with Todd.

397
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,688
I'm afraid of getting hurt.

398
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:21,597
Oh, sweetie. It's your first crush.

399
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,612
Why don't you just enjoy it?

400
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:26,296
No, Fran. I'm really
afraid of getting hurt.

401
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:28,731
Those juice boxes are hard.

402
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:34,224
All right. So you picked the wrong guy.

403
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:35,519
No biggie.

404
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,709
Just move on with your life.

405
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:38,646
Ok?

406
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:42,676
Hope he ends up in attica with a
cellmate that finds him attractive.

407
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:46,293
Ah, you're back, Miss Fine.

408
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,938
Good. How did it go?

409
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:50,065
Well, my mother's thrilled.

410
00:20:50,078 --> 00:20:54,138
She finally figured out why she has
an unnatural attachment to egg creams.

411
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:56,997
The Chinese food we're blaming on the man

412
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:59,356
that used to press grandma Yetta's blouses.

413
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,578
Concede, dad.

414
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:04,649
I've got you in two moves.

415
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:06,808
You're done. Finished.

416
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:08,353
Toast. Ha!

417
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,689
Checkmate.

418
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:14,103
What?

419
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:15,830
What happened to this board?

420
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:18,227
Oh, never leave two queens alone together.

421
00:21:18,214 --> 00:21:19,466
They'll redecorate.

422
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:32,536
Oh, I should've never
blamed my mother, anyway.

423
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,220
I should've known that
guy was out of my league.

424
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:36,972
Oh no, Miss Fine. He wasn't.

425
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:38,273
He duped you.

426
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,575
Yeah but I was right for the duping.

427
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:43,053
Once a girl's exposed to a guy like you,

428
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:44,761
so debonair and classy,

429
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:46,501
there's just no going back.

430
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,235
Well, I've been known to turn a few heads.

431
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:50,530
Oh, please.

432
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,057
Miss Babcock needs an exorcist.

433
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:57,236
- You want to hear something funny?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:21:57,356 --> 00:22:00,283
The therapist said that
I was subconsciously

435
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:01,691
avoiding a relationship.

436
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:03,649
Oh, please. With whom?

437
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:05,345
I know. I know.

438
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:08,517
I mean, believe me, if
there was a guy out there,

439
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:11,114
single, successful, attractive,

440
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:13,303
I'd smell him a mile away.

441
00:22:13,423 --> 00:22:14,648
What's that... Aramis?

442
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:15,705
Yes.

443
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:17,181
You know...

444
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:19,565
Grace's therapist said
exactly the same thing to me.

445
00:22:19,596 --> 00:22:21,692
Well, yeah. You.

446
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:23,450
No. Trust me, Miss Fine.

447
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:25,420
If I found a woman who loved my children,

448
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,660
could make me laugh and I found attractive,

449
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,011
I'd never let her get away.

450
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:29,681
Hear, hear.

451
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,389
Ooh ooh. Hang on a second.

452
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:32,934
We're stuck on each other.
