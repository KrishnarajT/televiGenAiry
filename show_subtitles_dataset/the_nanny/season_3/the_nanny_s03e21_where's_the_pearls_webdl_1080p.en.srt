1
00:00:00,414 --> 00:00:01,681
Oh, Niles, good.

2
00:00:01,749 --> 00:00:04,483
Look, I know it's your day
off, but I need you to work.

3
00:00:04,551 --> 00:00:07,187
I need you to run this ad copy

4
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:09,155
- down to John Kennedy's office for me.
- All right.

5
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:10,223
John John?

6
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:12,592
You know, it's his day off.

7
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:14,794
Would you stop being such a slave driver?

8
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:16,463
I'll take it to him.

9
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,930
And what's more, I'll make sure

10
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:20,033
that John John signs for it personally.

11
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,835
Oh, that isn't necessary, Miss Fine.

12
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:23,436
Oh, yes, it is.

13
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:26,806
Who's coming over?

14
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:28,175
Elizabeth Taylor.

15
00:00:29,877 --> 00:00:31,611
Oh, beautifully executed, sir.

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,980
- Where's Mr. Kennedy?
- In Singapore.

17
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:36,849
Think she'll wait for him?

18
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:39,285
Very good, sir. Very, very good.

19
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:46,025
Boys, boys, boys.

20
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,328
Now, do you think that my mother

21
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:51,530
gave birth to a dummy 25 years ago?

22
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:58,471
You two wouldn't let me near
George Kennedy, let alone John.

23
00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:00,240
Now who's coming over here?

24
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:02,108
Well, it doesn't really matter, Miss Fine,

25
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:05,412
because you are not going
to meet her, him or it.

26
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,447
Oh, you know, I cannot believe
that you don't trust me.

27
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:11,251
I mean, I sit here cooped
up in the house all day long.

28
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:13,853
You never introduce me to any
of the stars that you know.

29
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,454
You never let me in any of your shows.

30
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:18,558
I have a good mind to go
get Little Ricky and, oh...

31
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:23,529
Nanny Fine,

32
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:26,031
I need you to drop off this script

33
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:28,801
to Antonio Banderas.

34
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:31,404
Forget it, Miss Babcock.

35
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:34,040
I already know who's coming
over here this afternoon.

36
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,776
- C.C...
- You told her about Elizabeth Taylor?

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,014
No. You did.

38
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,186
Oh, Elizabeth Taylor!

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,087
Oh, when I was a little girl,

40
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:50,189
my mother would dress me
up like her for Halloween.

41
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:53,426
All that big dark hair and dramatic makeup,

42
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:55,295
tight little dress.

43
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:56,729
Oh, I'll tell you,

44
00:01:56,797 --> 00:01:59,365
the things you can get
away with when you're a kid.

45

46
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,451
Oh, it's so nice to meet you, Miss Taylor.

47
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:58,091
Perfect.

48
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:02,929
Maxwell, Nanny Fine's in the living room!

49
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:05,465
Miss Fine!

50
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,068
I'm just seeing the kids off to school.

51
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,969
They left an hour ago.

52
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:12,404
Well, it's a clear day. I can see forever.

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,043
Miss Fine, what are the rules?

54
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,845
Niles, and only Niles,
is to answer the door.

55
00:03:19,913 --> 00:03:22,915
I'm to stay away from your office,

56
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,585
and I'm forbidden to create a diversion

57
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:28,488
such as setting a small
but containable fire.

58
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:34,661
And no staged emergencies
with the children either.

59
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:36,328
Oh, come on.

60
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:39,599
Help! I think I broke my arm.

61
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,668
Save it, honey. We've been busted.

62
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:48,641
Elizabeth Taylor.

63
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:59,452
I'll get it.

64
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,497
Hello.

65
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,472
Oh, Elizabeth Taylor.

66
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,507
This is such an honor.

67
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,710
I'm Fran. Look at the pretty table.

68
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,314
Keep looking.

69
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:31,851
Keep looking.

70
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:35,855
Oh, forget it.

71
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,128
Miss Fine.

72
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,706
So, are you Maxwell's wife?

73
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:56,075
Oh, no. I just work for him.

74
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:58,410
Actually, I've never been married.

75
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:00,013
Not even once?

76
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,487
Well, you know, there was one time,

77
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,390
but then I thought about it...

78
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,891
That was your mistake, dear.

79
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,534
Shouldn't you tell Maxwell I'm here?

80
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:23,303
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Sure.

81
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,805
You know what? I'll just buzz him.

82
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:27,874
Just buzz him.

83
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:29,309
Buzz, buzz.

84
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:34,914
Oh, Miss Taylor, I have seen
everything that you've ever done.

85
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:37,483
Cleopatra, Virginia Woolf.

86
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:39,752
But you know what my favorite was?

87
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,621
Here's Lucy.

88
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:46,626
Oh, I'll tell you, when your ring

89
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,128
got stuck on her finger...

90
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,965
You know, I bet you a lot
of people ask you this,

91
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,566
- but could I just...
- No.

92
00:05:57,571 --> 00:06:01,874
Okay. Well, I'll just go hang up your coat.

93
00:06:09,283 --> 00:06:10,649
Ma!

94
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,089
What are you doing here?

95
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,358
The boy let me in.

96
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:21,694
I've got to meet Elizabeth Taylor!

97
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:23,496
Excuse me!

98
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,464
Over my dead body.

99
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,466
If I could meet Elizabeth Taylor,

100
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:29,835
I could retire in Florida tomorrow.

101
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,371
Miss Taylor, I'd like
you to meet my mother.

102
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,118
Sylvia Fine.

103
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:50,256
This meeting bestows an honor upon me

104
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:54,259
which is unparalleled within my universe.

105
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,431
Oh, Maxwell! Thank God.

106
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:01,234
Elizabeth.

107
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:04,536
Sylvia, Miss Fine. You're fired.

108
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:07,673
Elizabeth, I'm so sorry.

109
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:09,342
I didn't know you had already arrived.

110
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,277
Oh, didn't you hear the buzzer?

111
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:12,511
No.

112
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:17,149
Elizabeth, this is my
associate, C.C. Babcock.

113
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:25,524
Hello, Elizabeth Taylor.

114
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:29,362
I bet she isn't married.

115
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,470
Well, why don't we step into
my study, have a spot of tea?

116
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:46,379
Ah, and here it is.

117
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:56,789
Oh, how do you do, Tiss Maylor.

118
00:07:56,857 --> 00:07:58,391
I'm Biles the nutler.

119
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:04,997
That's not right, is it?

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,868
This way, Elizabeth.
Just follow the nutler.

121
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:12,571
I'll be right there, Maxwell.

122
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,842
Oh, Fran, could you do me a massive favor?

123
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,444
- Yes. Yes.
- I'm wearing these for a photo shoot

124
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:21,147
to promote my new
fragrance, "Black Pearls."

125
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:24,750
- Say, could I...
- No.

126
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,786
Oh.

127
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:29,355
Could you just call a bonded courier

128
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,190
and have these sent to this address?

129
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,859
- You're a love.
- Oh, oh, yes, my queen.

130
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,061
Yes. That call will get made.

131
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,664
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

132
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,473
You know, sweetheart, I
wouldn't trust a courier.

133
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,208
- No?
- Those armed trucks

134
00:08:49,276 --> 00:08:51,610
just scream, "Rob me. Rob me".

135
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,147
You know, you're right, Ma.

136
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:57,884
I can't trust no bonded
courier professional.

137
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:00,887
I'm gonna have to do this myself.

138
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:04,056
Oh, I can't believe you hid in the closet.

139
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:06,926
To tell you the truth, it wasn't my idea.

140
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,834
Come on out, Yetta.

141
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,516
Ah, excuse me.

142
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,986
Excuse me!

143
00:09:34,054 --> 00:09:34,954
What?

144
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:51,603
You know, it isn't so
much the half-eaten McDLT

145
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:54,006
that bothers me so much.

146
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:58,544
It's the fact that they
discontinued them in '94.

147
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,246
Oh, my God! I didn't realize

148
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:04,383
I had Princess Caroline
of Monaco in my back seat.

149
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:06,319
Forgive me, Your Highness.
I didn't recognize you

150
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,821
with your new Priscilla Presley hairdo.

151
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:15,828
Listen, uh... Cozette?

152
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,529
Yeah. I'm French.

153
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:23,436
You know, there are occupations
that don't depend on tips.

154
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,273
What is that supposed to mean?

155
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,508
Well, it's just that you're...

156
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,244
you're a very unpleasant
person, as people go.

157
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,615
Well, thank you very much.

158
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,352
If you were trying to hurt my feelings

159
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:44,791
you have succeeded. Okay?

160
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:48,527
I mean, I have been
having a really hard week,

161
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:51,463
a lot of stress, a lot of pain.

162
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:56,134
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I... I had no idea.

163
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,336
What's his name? What did he do?

164
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,438
Jean-Claude.

165
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:02,742
It's my birthday, right?

166
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:05,111
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

167
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:06,478
Do I get perfume?

168
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:07,747
- No.
- No.

169
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,015
Do I get flowers?

170
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,215
- No.
- No.

171
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:12,818
You know, I'm a woman. I'm sensitive.

172
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:15,321
I have needs.

173
00:11:15,388 --> 00:11:17,957
Hey, does it say "Wheelchair Crossing"?

174
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:31,537
Honey, you know, let me give you
just a little piece of advice.

175
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:37,209
I was just talking to my
girlfriend, Elizabeth Taylor.

176
00:11:37,277 --> 00:11:40,880
Elizabeth Taylor Hilton Wilding Todd Fisher

177
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:44,750
Burton Burton Warner Fortenski?

178
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,392
No wonder her hips keep breaking down.

179
00:11:56,996 --> 00:12:00,732
That's a good one. One for you.

180
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,835
Oh, honey, your mascara's running
just a little bit over there.

181
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:05,404
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

182
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:07,473
So, let me just show you something.

183
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,374
You're gonna get a big kick out of this.

184
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:10,977
Red light, sweetie.

185
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:12,778
Have you ever seen anything...

186
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:14,613
red light, honey.

187
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,816
Take one look at... red light!

188
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:38,671
What could be taking that doctor so long?

189
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:41,573
Well, she couldn't have
hit her head that badly.

190
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:44,376
Her hair alone should act
like a built-in air bag.

191
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,548
I can't believe my daughter
is lying in a hospital.

192
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:55,854
Mmm. This isn't bad.

193
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:59,424
I don't know why everyone
complains about the food.

194
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,965
Don't worry. She's gonna be just fine.

195
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:08,300
But I have to warn you,
she's not quite all there.

196
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:12,437
Oh, no, no. That's normal.

197
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:16,142
She bruised her brain and is
experiencing some loss of memory.

198
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,743
Memory loss?

199
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:21,280
Don't worry. It'll come back.

200
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:24,083
The same thing happened to me once.

201
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:25,651
When?

202
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:27,552
When what?

203
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:33,492
Her memory will return on its own.

204
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,394
Just don't force it. You can see her now.

205
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,668
Maxwell, thank goodness.

206
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:46,004
Elizabeth Taylor's
black pearls are missing,

207
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,906
and the last person who had them...

208
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:49,341
C.C., not now.

209
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:52,678
Miss Fine is lying in a
hospital bed with amnesia.

210
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:54,280
I'll kill her!

211
00:13:55,182 --> 00:13:56,481
Hi.

212
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,950
I'm Gracie.

213
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,251
I'm Brighton.

214
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,653
I'm Maggie.

215
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:02,387
Wait a minute.

216
00:14:02,456 --> 00:14:05,558
You know, this seems familiar to me.

217
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,694
Say, did I ever sing on
some Austrian hillside

218
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:10,563
with a really butch haircut?

219
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:18,370
Everybody out. Out.

220
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:22,107
I have to speak to the
brain-bruised woman in the bed.

221
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,078
She does need her rest now.

222
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:28,280
Your family can come back
later and take you home.

223
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,815
Oh, thank you.

224
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,819
So how are you? How are you feeling?

225
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,988
Well, you know, I feel pretty good,

226
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:38,090
but I think that this bump on the head

227
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:41,627
really screwed with my nasal passages.

228
00:14:41,695 --> 00:14:45,230
I mean, can you imagine
going through life like this?

229
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,903
Please, please, does...

230
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:56,408
does the name Elizabeth
Taylor ring any bells?

231
00:14:56,476 --> 00:14:57,943
Yes, yes, of course.

232
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,545
Of course. I remember.

233
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:01,079
Oh, yes. Yes.

234
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:03,515
I'm Elizabeth Taylor.

235
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:08,053
No! You're not Elizabeth Taylor!

236
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:09,888
Bummer.

237
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:16,194
She doesn't remember.

238
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:21,700
Who are you?

239
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:23,668
I'm your grandma.

240
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:27,406
Boy, I'm lucky.

241
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:31,043
I think everything worked out just
the way I always thought it would.

242
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,746
I'm married to a great-looking guy

243
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,048
and I have three gorgeous children.

244
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:39,684
Oh, honey, you got hit on the head.

245
00:15:39,752 --> 00:15:42,187
You're a little confused.

246
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:46,025
The two big ones are
from a previous marriage.

247
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:59,638
Niles, what could she have
done with those bloody pearls?

248
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:02,741
Is there any sign of Miss
Fine's memory returning?

249
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,643
Well, she couldn't find her room,

250
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:06,545
but she was able to recall the numbers

251
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,781
on your American Express Gold Card.

252
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,821
And your mother's maiden name.

253
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,025
Oh, here, try to relax, sir. There.

254
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:23,161
I'll have your brandy and cigar.

255
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:25,097
Waiting for me when I get out?

256
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:26,999
Um... yeah.

257
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:01,767
Hi, hubby.

258
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:07,706
Oh, dear God in heaven!

259
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:11,744
Oh, sweetie, I don't remember
much about our married life,

260
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,212
but I figure there's got to be a reason

261
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,915
why this tub is big enough for two.

262
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:22,988
Oh, gee, I wish that would clear up.

263
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:27,259
Ah, yes, of course, our, um...

264
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,327
our married life. Uh...

265
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,596
I... I know I'm not supposed

266
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:35,267
to jar your memory or anything, but, uh...

267
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,970
But what?

268
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,907
Happy 10th anniversary, darling.

269
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:47,679
No, no, no, no, no, no! I can't do this.

270
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:50,916
Look, I'm not your husband.

271
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:54,486
Oh, my God! We're not married?

272
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,857
The truth is I hired you.

273
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,525
I'm a hooker?

274
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:06,664
Well, that explains my shoes.

275
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,936
No, no. You're... you're my nanny.

276
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:12,971
You take care of my children.

277
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:17,576
But I've got style. I've got flair.

278
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:19,845
How could I become the nanny?

279
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:25,117
Oh, everything's upside down.

280
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:28,520
Wait a minute. You're still on
Remington Steele, aren't you?

281
00:18:31,157 --> 00:18:33,158
I am not Pierce Brosnan.

282
00:18:36,062 --> 00:18:40,499
I am Maxwell Sheffield, and
you are my nanny, Fran Fine.

283
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,469
Now, would you please get out of my bath?

284
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:49,341
Oh, nice try, mister. You get out first.

285
00:18:49,976 --> 00:18:52,611
Don't splash me!

286
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,179
Don't. Stop it! Stop it!

287
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:55,681
Oh! Don't! Stop it! Don't! Don't!

288
00:18:55,749 --> 00:18:57,149
Oh! Oh! Oh!

289
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:08,693
Excuse me, sir, Miss
Babcock's on the phone for you,

290
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:11,563
but I'll just tell her
you'll call right back

291
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:16,068
right after you and Miss
Fine get out of the Jacuzzi.

292
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:25,010
Morning, sir.

293
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:26,345
Morning, Niles.

294
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,514
There seems to be a
problem with the phones.

295
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:31,783
I unplugged them, Niles.

296
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:35,187
What if Miss Taylor should
call looking for her pearls?

297
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:38,791
Ah, what if the person who
finds them tries to call?

298
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:44,063
Plug them back in, Niles.

299
00:19:45,431 --> 00:19:47,799
Got any more bright ideas?

300
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,372
Good morning.

301
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:56,074
Can I ask you a question?

302
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:58,744
I have been dressing
like this for three years,

303
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:01,246
and there's nothing going on between us?

304
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:07,185
That's right. I'm your employer.

305
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,420
Mmm.

306
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:10,622
And what is it you do again?

307
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,024
I produce musical theater.

308
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,460
Oh, now it's all making sense to me.

309
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,001
Oh, and you, mister, don't you go anywhere.

310
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:25,103
After breakfast, you're
cleaning up the dishes.

311
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:28,940
It's part of your punishment for
cutting fourth period last Thursday.

312
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:30,409
That she remembers?

313
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:37,916
Do you recognize this man?

314
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,819
No. No.

315
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:43,354
No. No. No.

316
00:20:44,424 --> 00:20:45,891
Who are all those men?

317
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,459
They're your father,

318
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:51,963
just wearing different hair.

319
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:58,370
I just can't take this
any more. I got to go.

320
00:20:58,438 --> 00:21:01,206
I'm late for your cousin Rose's wedding.

321
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:03,742
What?

322
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,112
Rose the nose is getting married before me?

323
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:10,669
Fran?

324
00:21:11,917 --> 00:21:13,352
Ma?

325
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:20,091
♪ How much is that dress in Macy's window?

326
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:29,268
♪ Who cares? It'll be
at Loehmann's on sale ♪

327
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:32,337
Fran, you're back.

328
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:34,306
Oh, Ma.

329
00:21:37,177 --> 00:21:40,279
Oh, Ma, I don't believe it.

330
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:42,780
It's all coming back to me now.

331
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:45,517
I was driving along, and I hit my head,

332
00:21:45,585 --> 00:21:48,687
and I left Elizabeth
Taylor's pearls in the taxi.

333
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:50,822
And I'm getting out of here.

334
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:53,859
You lost Elizabeth Taylor's pearls?

335
00:21:53,926 --> 00:21:56,728
Well, you're the one that
told me not to use a courier.

336
00:21:56,796 --> 00:21:58,863
Oh, Miss Fine.

337
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:00,799
Who are you?

338
00:22:02,401 --> 00:22:05,270
Oh, don't you remember me?

339
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:08,761
Ah, well, you look awfully familiar, but...

340
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:11,376
Oh, gee, I've met so many people this week.

341
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:13,978
Oh, come on, think.

342
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:17,482
Oh, I know. You're that nice,
loving, and forgiving man.

343
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,083
Guess again.

344
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:21,553
You're my employer?

345
00:22:21,621 --> 00:22:23,422
Guess again.

346
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:27,025
You're my worst nightmare?

347
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:28,326
You've got it!
