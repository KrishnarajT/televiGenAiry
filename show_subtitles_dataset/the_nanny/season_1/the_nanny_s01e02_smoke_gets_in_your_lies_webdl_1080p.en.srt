1
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:10,941
Oh, that's Val.  You know, 
it's her first time to the mansion,

2
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:14,087
and she's my best friend, 
so I just want her to drop dead.

3
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:15,785
How thoughtful.

4
00:00:15,785 --> 00:00:19,011
Allow me.  You pose. 
/Okay.

5
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:26,960
I'm dropping dead.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,093
Mission accomplished.

7
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:32,782
May I take your coat? 
/Do I get a stub?

8
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,158
No.  And you don't 
have to tip him either.

9
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:39,181
Oy, she's got no class. 
 Come on, Val, move.

10
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:44,577
Oy, this place is
 like the Taj Mahal.

11
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,525
Only with more bathrooms. 
 You never have to wait.

12
00:00:47,525 --> 00:00:50,558
How come I'm still stuck in Flushing
 and you're living like Jackie O?

13
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,894
Jackie O is 
two doors down.

14
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:55,657
Jackie O's your neighbor?
 /Uh-huh.

15
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:59,561
And, you know, she's very 
concerned about John-John.

16
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:02,475
You heard he quit the D.A.
 job, huh? /Oh, really?

17
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:06,681
Oh, yeah.  And now he ran off 
to California with that blonde fish.

18
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:10,332
Oh.  Oh, God, oh, go have kids.

19
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:14,996
Honey, it's all in how you raise them. 
 With mine, I got no complaints.

20
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:16,724
You've been their nanny
 for two weeks.

21
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:18,967
And I've worked
 wonders with them.

22
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,764
Shut-up, Brighton! 
/You shut-up!

23
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,300
You're giving me
 a nervous breakdown!

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,274
You see?  Before me 
they never communicated.

25
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:29,919
You know, you're gonna get pimples, 
too, some day, if you ever grow up!

26
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:32,538
Oh, that's a pimple?  
I thought it was a small planet.

27
00:01:32,538 --> 00:01:34,687
Leave your sister alone.
 /I can't.

28
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:37,699
The gravitational force
 is sucking me in!

29
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:41,819
I'm giving it all she's got, Captain. 
 I cannot break away.

30
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,915
You're so pathetic, 
Brighton!

31
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:45,600
We both hate you!

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,216
Good.  
Then my work here is done.

33
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:50,392
Brighton,
 what's your problem?

34
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:53,380
I guess I'm just
 bad to the bone.

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,684
No, honey, you have
 no idea what bad is.

36
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,481
Now the boys Val and I went to 
school with, they were bad, huh?

37
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:02,789
Oh, the worst. 
/Oy, and now they're all taken.

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,251
You remember Lenny?

39
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:10,579
Sure.  Lenny Brown.  
Baddest man in the whole damn... 
Oh no, that was Leroy.

40
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,910
But Lenny was bad. 
/And tough.

41
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,429
The kid had a smoker's 
cough in the fourth grade.

42
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:20,034
Really? /Oh, he could blow 
smoke rings out of his nose,

43
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:22,113
either nostril.

44
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:24,516
Remember when he would light
 a match off his zipper?

45
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:28,002
Honey, I'm still 
dreaming about that one.

46
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,796
So he was cool, huh? 
/Oh, he was a god.

47
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:34,116
The James Dean of Flushing.  
I wonder whatever happened to him?

48
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:36,623
I hear he's a big shot 
at R.J. Reynolds.

49
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:41,402
Oh, I should have nabbed him 
right out of reform school.

50
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:34,800
If this facial doesn't work,
 I think I'm gonna kill myself.

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,878
Maggie, would you relax? 
 It's just a little zit.

52
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:40,386
Yeah, but... 
/Shut-up, Brighton.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,869
I dread puberty. 
 I have combination skin.

54
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:48,811
Here's where having me 
for a nanny comes in handy.

55
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,784
You kids know that I'm a graduate
 of the Ultissima Beauty Institute.

56
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:58,043
Four times Dean's list.
 /And yet she's so accessible.

57
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,668
What's that? /Orange rinds.

58
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:04,681
You know, at Elizabeth Arden
 they'll charge you two hundred dollars
 and call it aroma therapy.

59
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,675
Trust me, you'll be gorgeous.

60
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:10,064
I see an improvement already.

61
00:04:10,855 --> 00:04:12,010
What's this?

62
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,570
Oh, some stupid thing 
at my stupid school.

63
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,739
Oh, a carnival.

64
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,114
Oh, me and Val used to throw 
these for Jerry's kids.

65
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:22,529
Who's Jerry?
 /Jerry Lewis.

66
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:27,658
He used to be hysterical.  
Now he's hysterical in France.

67
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,198
Yeah, right.  Like we're gonna 
go to some dumb carnival.

68
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:32,639
Why?  It says right here,
 'fun for the whole family.'

69
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,793
Wouldn't we actually have 
to be a family first.

70
00:04:34,793 --> 00:04:37,671
Dad's too busy.  He doesn't
 have time to spend with us.

71
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:41,321
Maybe Daddy's seeing 
other children.

72
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:46,833
Let's not be paranoid.

73
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,128
I'm not paranoid.

74
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:52,439
Who said I was?

75
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,700
Help, Niles.  We need drinks.
 And keep them coming.

76
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,345
I take it, sir, the composer 
meetings aren't going well.

77
00:04:57,345 --> 00:05:01,639
Why isn't there any new talent in this town?  
The man in my office is positively ancient.

78
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,156
He's not composing, 
he's decomposing.

79
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:09,551
I got something that'll cheer you up. 
 There's a big carnival 
at Brighton's school this Saturday.

80
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:12,270
Oh, food, rides, games.  
Sounds splendid.

81
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,010
By all means, take the children.  
Have a wonderful time.

82
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,268
Well, I kind of thought that
 the whole family would go.
 That would include the father.

83
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:22,120
Oh, I'm sorry. 
 I'm seeing composers all weekend.

84
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,205
Oh well, that's understandable.

85
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,464
Why do I feel a 'but' coming on?

86
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:28,914
No but.

87
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:34,125
However, a carnival would be a good way
 for you to spend some time with your kids.

88
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,178
And time is so fleeting 
at this age.

89
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,604
While I appreciate the skill 
and subtlety of your guilt mongering,

90
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:45,308
I am opening a musical 
in eight weeks. /So?

91
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:47,671
I have no music. 
/Oh.

92
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:50,894
Otherwise I'd love to go. 
Brighton, don't be so smart.

93
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:54,126
Gracie, dear, take smaller 
bites.  And, Maggie,

94
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:57,829
do try to be a bit more outgoing.
  Well, carry on.

95
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:00,704
Well, he's got my vote 
for father of the year.

96
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:04,350
Now, now, he would 
if he could, but he can't.

97
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,470
I mean, the man has to 
make a living, don't he?

98
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,490
Well how else can we afford the lifestyle
 to which I've become accustomed?

99
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:22,775
So I flunked facials.  
We'll color it in and call it a mole.

100
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:27,426
There.  You look just 
like Cindy Crawford.

101
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:30,856
I look like
 John Boy Walton.

102
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:34,737
America loves him.

103
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:39,037
Hey, Mags.  Wow, 
you look really beautiful.

104
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:40,037
And?

105
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:43,404
And nothing.  
You look really good.

106
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,260
Shut-up, Brighton.

107
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:50,316
Why are you being so nice 
to your sister?  Who'd you kill?

108
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:52,501
Why does everyone 
assume the worst of me?

109
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:55,702
It saves time.

110
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:58,939
You know, we did handwriting 
analysis in school today.

111
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,041
I found out I'm very vulnerable.

112
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,725
Oh, isn't that 
fascinating?

113
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:07,595
Gee, I don't suppose you'd
 wanna analyze my handwriting?

114
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,639
Well, sure.

115
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,348
I happen to have a piece of old, 
unimportant scrap paper somewhere. Let's see.

116
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:17,982
Ah, why don't you sign 
your name right here?

117
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:21,096
Okay.  Sucker!

118
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,951
What just happened here?

119
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:28,833
Honey, I am so far ahead of you, 
we're in different time zones.

120
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,665
Oh, a note from the Headmaster.

121
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:33,766
You're kidding?

122
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,149
Brighton Millhouse Sheffield!

123
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,400
You were caught smoking?! 
/I was holding it for a friend.

124
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,991
Oh, please, Brighton. 
 Smoking? That's disgusting.

125
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:48,090
It takes the idiots that start 
that filthy habit years to quit.

126
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,906
I still haven't knocked off 
all the weight.

127
00:07:50,906 --> 00:07:52,461
Where are you going?

128
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:54,324
Where do you think? 
 To tell your father.

129
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:58,068
You heard.  The man's busy. 
/Not too busy to hear this.

130
00:07:58,068 --> 00:08:03,908
But he'll ship me off to military school.
 And can our country really afford that?

131
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:10,928
Brighton, smoking.  Where would 
you ever even get an idea like that?

132
00:08:10,928 --> 00:08:13,714
From you.

133
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:16,594
Come to think of it.

134
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,349
Me?

135
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,210
Bad, bad Lenny Brown. /What?

136
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,838
Oh.  Oy.

137
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,372
So, uh, maybe we should just 
keep this our little secret.

138
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:32,829
Wait a minute.  Are you 
trying to blackmail me?

139
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:37,584
Let's just say, if I'm going down, 
you're going down with me.

140
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:40,407
Who are you?  
Edward G. Robinson?

141
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:45,730
You think I'm gonna be intimidated by somebody
 that could walk under a coffee table?

142
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:49,664
He'll fire me.  I'd fire me.

143
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:54,580
Just when I figured out the bidet
 is not a water fountain.

144
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,834
Oh, what am I doing?  I quit.

145
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:01,370
I gotta learn to deal with
 my problems without a crutch.

146
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,490
What's to eat?

147
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:09,965
What was I thinking telling a story
 like that to a ten year old kid?

148
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:13,374
On the other hand, if I told him to 
jump off the Empire State Building...

149
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:20,891
Hello.  That was my mother's voice 
that just crossed the Queensboro Bridge 
and flew out my mouth.

150
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:24,217
But with such dulcet tones.

151
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:27,821
Oh boy, this is so 
typical of kids.

152
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:31,171
You try and you try 
and what do you get?

153
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:36,921
A slap in the face. 
Oy, my mother again. 
 Niles, call an exorcist.

154
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:41,110
The previous nannies signed all
 of Master Brighton's discipline 
reports themselves.

155
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,075
You're kidding? 
 The nanny can do that?

156
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:49,053
Of course.  In fact, 
Nanny Six retired with
 Carpal-Tunnel syndrome.

157
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:51,398
You know, Brighton wanted 
me to sign that note,

158
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:54,465
but at the time he was just
 looking to save his butt.

159
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:58,125
Of course, now that
 I'm looking to save mine,
 it's not such a bad idea.

160
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:01,141
No, I've gotta tell Mister
 Sheffield what I did.

161
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:05,514
If I don't, the evil eye'll get me.
  I'll be hit by a bus for sure.

162
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:09,859
The evil eye?  Your mother again? 
/No.  Grandma Yetta.

163
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:15,221
Well, Miss Fine, it's always 
a pleasure spending time 
with you and your family.

164
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:19,137
The kind of music that I hear
 for this show is kind of a,

165
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:22,007
you know, Bacharach/David kind of 
a "Promises, Promises" thing.

166
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:25,131
Ya-ta-da, ya-ta-da, da, da. 
 Ya-ta-da, ya-ta-da, da, da.

167
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:27,004
Bounce, bounce.  
Lots of bounce.

168
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:31,625
I'm not sure. /You're right. 
 Dated!  Awful!  Out!

169
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:34,624
Knock, knock. 
/Yes, Miss Fine, what is it?

170
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:38,100
And quickly, please.  We have eight
 more composers to see today.

171
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,523
And you're right up there.

172
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:42,956
Well?

173
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:45,975
Oh, maybe this isn't the right time.
  I don't want to annoy you.

174
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:48,020
Too late.  Go on.

175
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,019
Okay.  It's about Brighton. 
/Yes?

176
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,119
Well, remember the other day Val 
and I were talking in the kitchen?

177
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,698
Or was it the living room?  
Anyway, it was somewhere in the house.

178
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,039
It's such a nice house.

179
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,563
You know, that's a lovely painting.
  Who are those people?

180
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:06,434
Miss Fine! / Well, it's just that it brings 
the color out in the couch so nice.

181
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:10,260
Yeah, well they say Rembrandt 
goes with everything.

182
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,193
Now what about Brighton?  
Is he injured?

183
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,236
No.

184
00:11:13,236 --> 00:11:15,488
Well is there property damage? 
/ No.

185
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:18,055
Is he missing?
 / No, he's right upstairs.

186
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:21,288
Well then, what are you doing here? Isn't 
this something you could handle on your own.

187
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:26,424
Honestly, Maxwell, what is the point of having
 a nanny if she can't take care of
 these things on her own?

188
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:30,828
Isn't that what I just said? 
/Yes, but I wanted to say it, too.

189
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:33,154
Look, Miss Fine, whatever it is,
 just take care of it.

190
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:35,501
I'm giving you carte blanche, 
all right?

191
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,511
All right.

192
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:44,620
Oh, well, Niles, that was easier 
than I thought it would be.

193
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,270
You didn't tell him, did you?

194
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,319
No.

195
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:50,784
What about Grandma Yetta's evil eye?

196
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:55,193
Oh, that's just an old bubbameister. 
/ Bubbameister?

197
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:58,558
A bubbameister.  
It's like an old wives tale.

198
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:01,651
Honestly, Niles, 
it's the nineties for god sakes.

199
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:05,237
Who believes in the evil eye anyway?

200
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,390
Oy.

201
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:20,645
You're up early. 
/I couldn't sleep.

202
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:21,699
Hm-hmm.

203
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,639
I have indigestion.  It has nothing 
to do with a guilty conscience 
if that's what you're implying.

204
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,429
Crepes. 
/Back-off, Niles.

205
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:31,690
I said I would punish the kid. 
 What else do you want?

206
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,010
Dare I suggest syrup?

207
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,530
Oh, what's with the third degree?

208
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,764
I tried to tell him,
 the man doesn't listen.

209
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:42,570
Everything I say goes in one ear 
and out the other.

210
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,978
Good morning, Miss Fine. 
 I've been thinking about what you said.

211
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:49,189
What?  What did I say?
/About spending more time with the children.

212
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:51,928
Yes, see?  I've already started.

213
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:54,688
Children, we are going to the carnival.

214
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,735
All of us? 
/ Hm-hmm.  The whole family.

215
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,572
We're gonna go on the rides.  
We're going to eat cotton candy.

216
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:03,080
It'll be like being 
a child again.

217
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,177
And it'll give me a chance to talk
 to Brighton's headmaster.

218
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:08,363
See what he's been up to. 
/ Whoops.

219
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:11,646
These things can get so sticky.

220
00:13:13,153 --> 00:13:19,019
Uh, you know, I kind of soured 
on that whole carnival thing. 
It's so cold and windy.

221
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,410
It's in the gymnasium.
 / Hot and stuffy.

222
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,766
Miss Fine, I've just rearranged
 my entire schedule,

223
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,928
and now you're telling 
me you don't want to go.

224
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:29,546
Well, I'm not god.  
I don't make the weather.

225
00:13:29,546 --> 00:13:32,051
But you insisted.

226
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:36,286
I wasn't feeling 
a hundred percent that day. 
 I think I was ovulating.

227
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,694
Your eggs, sir?

228
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:45,226
Well, you may stay at home,
 but we are going.

229
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,927
Do something.

230
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,587
Okay, I'll do what I should 
have done in the first place.

231
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:51,327
Here, here.

232
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:53,486
Here.

233
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:59,872
Mister Sheffield, I think 
there's something you should know.

234
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,577
Brighton?

235
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:06,388
We don't care that you're on parole.
 Everyone deserves a second chance.

236
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,968
Fine.  I'll tell him.

237
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:15,004
Mister Sheffield,
 when we go to the carnival,

238
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:18,697
the headmaster may mention something 
about Brighton smoking.

239
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,689
But he's quit.  And he's sorry. 
 And there's really  nothing 
for you to worry about.

240
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:24,400
Niles, these crepes are divine.

241
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,336
And so light. / My mother makes
 a blintz that could double for a mattress.

242
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:33,904
Girls, you may be excused.
 Not you, Miss Fine.

243
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:39,056
Smoking, Brighton?  
I, I can't believe this.

244
00:14:39,056 --> 00:14:42,736
What, what on earth 
possessed you to do this?

245
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:45,193
Are you through here?

246
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:48,459
It's beginning to look that way.

247
00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:52,715
Well, I'm waiting, young man. 
 What have you got to say for yourself.

248
00:14:52,715 --> 00:14:55,758
I didn't inhale.

249
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:04,188
That is the most pathetically 
lame excuse I have ever heard.

250
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:05,972
Go to your room.

251
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,738
Not you, Miss Fine.

252
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:11,975
Well, Mister Sheffield, 
I think there's something you should know.

253
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:14,881
Well, I'll say.  
Why wasn't I told about this?

254
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:18,286
Well, I tried to tell you. 
You told me to take care of it.

255
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:21,639
I didn't know what the problem was. 
/ Because you wouldn't listen.

256
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,864
Because you didn't tell me
 it was anything like this!

257
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:28,138
Oh, well, it's pointless
 to continue this discussion. 
 You had chocolate cake yesterday.

258
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:30,104
What's that bloody well
 got to do with anything?

259
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:32,387
Low blood sugar.  
You're completely irrational.

260
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:34,260
I'm irrational?  Me? 
/ Yes.

261
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,038
You're the one twisting everything around.
 /Oh, so now I'm twisting?

262
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:40,574
You are the most exasperating, 
infuriating...

263
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,184
I think I just had 
a small stroke.

264
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:48,801
Does that mean we're not 
going to the carnival?

265
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,416
Miss Fine...!

266
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,859
Well, it's very easy
 for you to find fault.

267
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:55,498
You're off all day with 
your glamorous theater people.

268
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,859
I'm stuck at home working
 like a dog raising the kids.

269
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:01,406
You're the nanny! 
 It's your job!

270
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:04,157
Well, you're the father.  
It's your job, too,

271
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:07,073
Mister Sheffield, sir.

272
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:09,392
Oh, just go to your room.

273
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:12,673
Yes, you!

274
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:16,678
Can you believe 
he sent me to my room?

275
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:20,832
He is so adorable sometimes.

276
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:28,694
I'm in love! 
 I'm in love!

277
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:32,584
I'm in love! 
/ No, no, no.  No, wrong.

278
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:35,829
Totally wrong.  Make a note. 
 Fire the casting director.

279
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:40,967
Maxwell, you're being
 an absolute beast today.  I love it.

280
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,551
It's just that, that I know exactly
 what I'm looking for.

281
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:46,695
I need a Broadway star
 with huge stage presence

282
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:50,257
who's instantly recognizable 
to the entire country.

283
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,427
Oh my god...

284
00:16:55,887 --> 00:17:00,896
Hello...
 / Next!

285
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:11,938
He's tough. 
/ You're telling me.

286
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:13,892
Break a leg, honey.

287
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:16,221
His.

288
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:19,484
I love her.

289
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:20,592
Your song, please?

290
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,058
Um, oh, I get to sing, too? 
 All right.

291
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:28,424
"People" in E flat.  Hit it.
 / Miss Fine!

292
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:31,293
Well, I can dream, can't I?

293
00:17:31,293 --> 00:17:34,583
Take a break. Ladies and gentlemen, 
let's take a break.

294
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,696
Miss Fine, we were 
in the middle of something.

295
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:40,184
Yes, I know.  
That's why I'm here.

296
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,668
You know, you shouldn't leave
 the house with things unresolved.

297
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:44,820
That's why men die young.

298
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,137
That's not why.
  It's because they want to.

299
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:52,900
The wife? 
/The nanny.

300
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,596
Look, we both know that you walked out
 on me because you were losing the argument.

301
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,494
I wasn't losing anything.

302
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:02,750
Trust me.  When you induce 
a stroke on your opponent, 
it's a sure win.

303
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,280
I think you're winning again.

304
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,148
But it wasn't a fair fight. 
 You didn't have all the facts.

305
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:09,651
I don't think
 I can take anymore.

306
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:14,372
Brighton got the idea to smoke
 from a story that he might have,

307
00:18:14,372 --> 00:18:18,436
maybe, sort of heard from me. 
/From you?

308
00:18:18,436 --> 00:18:20,839
Kinda. 
/Well what did you tell him?

309
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,151
Well, he said that he was bad and 
so I told him about a kid that was worse.

310
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,450
Who knew he'd take it 
as a challenge.

311
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,236
That's my boy.  Always striving
 to reach new depths.

312
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,545
Oh, I'm the worst nanny
 in the world.

313
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:38,236
All right, Rebecca 
De Morney, then me.

314
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:46,491
Oh, I could just cut my tongue out.
 So if you wanna fire me, do it now.

315
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:48,813
No, I'm not gonna fire you.

316
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:52,286
Although that offer to cut out
 your tongue might have some merit.

317
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:55,494
Why, if you told Brighton 
to jump off London Bridge...

318
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:56,982
God, I'm beginning to sound 
just like my...

319
00:18:56,982 --> 00:19:00,223
I know.  Don't you hate
 when that happens?

320
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,005
I still can't believe that
 son of yours didn't turn me in.

321
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:05,139
Yeah.  Why do you suppose that is?

322
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:09,856
Who knows?  He's probably got some
 hideous torture planned for me later.

323
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:13,673
No, I think perhaps....

324
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:16,105
I mean, could it be?

325
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,646
What? /He likes you?

326
00:19:18,646 --> 00:19:22,808
Well, stranger things
 have happened.

327
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:26,464
Well, you're the first nanny Brightons' 
made any kind of connection with.

328
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:31,596
His mother was the only 
one that could handle him.
 They had a special kind of relationship.

329
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:33,791
He feared her.

330
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,452
Fear.  That's the key.

331
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:43,850
Now we have to figure out a way 
to scare him bad enough that
 he never smokes again.

332
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,721
I sent him to his room.

333
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:51,196
Oh, please.  With a wide screen T.V.
 and a fully stocked mini-fridge?  Punish me.

334
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:53,237
So, what do you suggest?

335
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:56,552
Something much more cruel
 and unusual.

336
00:19:56,552 --> 00:20:01,026
We are going to have to consult 
the high priestess of punishment.

337
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:03,963
Hello, Ma?

338
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:14,691
Grandma Yetta?

339
00:20:15,133 --> 00:20:16,699
Yeah?

340
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:22,334
It's Frannie.

341
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,214
Who?

342
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:25,235
Frannie, your granddaughter.

343
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:28,198
Oh, Frannie.  Hi.

344
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:30,621
Nice to meet you.

345
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,469
That's the one good thing about senility. 
You're always meeting new people.

346
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,168
How you doin', Angel?

347
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:46,211
Thank God I still got my health.

348
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,597
Maybe you two could go out 
and have a smoke later?

349
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:54,418
Morty!  Morty, you never 
looked so good.

350
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:56,803
Did you get hair plugs?

351
00:20:56,803 --> 00:21:00,529
Oh no, Grandma, 
that's not daddy.

352
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:03,566
So who the hell are you?

353
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:06,666
Oh, Maxwell Sheffield.

354
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,294
We brought you some babka.

355
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:11,146
Cake.  Put it away.

356
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:16,140
Save it for my room.  If they see
 babka, they'll all want.

357
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:18,963
Grandma, I want you
 to meet somebody.

358
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:23,582
Oh, I haven't seen you
 since you were this big.

359
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,583
No, Yetta, you never
 met him before.

360
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,003
Oh.

361
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,344
Oy, Yetta, you sound like
 you're making espresso over there.

362
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:38,783
All right, all right,
 I get the point.

363
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:41,682
Oh no, you don't, buddy.

364
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:44,055
We're just getting started.

365
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:47,485
Why don't you go
 visit with Yetta?

366
00:21:47,485 --> 00:21:49,072
Over there? / Yeah.

367
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:52,834
Where the air is nice and fresh.

368
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:56,726
Come here.  Let me
 have a look at that face.

369
00:21:56,726 --> 00:21:58,306
He's ready to quit smoking.

370
00:21:58,306 --> 00:22:00,860
Smoking?  Ech.

371
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:06,127
You smoke. /Me it doesn't
 effect.  I'm like a horse.

372
00:22:06,127 --> 00:22:09,932
But you, you know 
what could happen?

373
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:14,452
We'll go meet Ethel. 
 Phlegm in a hairnet.

374
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,299
Oh please, not Ethel.  
Not Ethel.

375
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,491
I swear.  I'll never touch another
 cigarette again.  Oh God...

376
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:25,736
So what do you say, 
we go grab a cup of coffee 
and break open the babka?  Hmm?

377
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:29,086
Babka?  Babka?
/ Babka?  Babka?
