1
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:03,325
Yes, we're in Paris.

2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:05,342
Miss Fine confused my
suitcase with one containing

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:08,173
C.C.'s dog Chester, got
locked in the closet of a 747,

4
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:10,840
and well, suffice it say, we're here.

5
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:15,766
Which I must admit, is
not entirely unpleasant.

6
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,482
For God sakes! I'm in Paris

7
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,390
with a beautiful woman.

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,632
Come on, let's blow this nightclub

9
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,737
and see where life takes us.

10
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,915
Apparently, French wine has
a very low alcohol content,

11
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:48,723
'cause life took us
right back to the airport.

12
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:50,057
Ooh! Ohh!

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,856
What the hell was that?

14
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:53,455
Oh, just a little bump in the road.

15
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,201
What, we hit a deer? We're in the air.

16
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:03,620
Oh, you have to picture yourself
going along a little country lane

17
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:05,753
with a few dips and pot holes.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,065
What the bloody hell was that?

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,603
Oh, Mr. Sheffield!

20
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:12,237
Mr. Sheffield, I just want you to know

21
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:13,603
that these last 3 years

22
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:16,651
have been just the best years of my life.

23
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,386
I love you.

24
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:36,513
Well, thank God it was just
a little bump in the road.

25
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:38,871
And after 3 long years of working it...

26
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:40,485
I mean, working there,

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,897
I had finally got him to say it.

28
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:45,194
Um, Miss Fine, be...

29
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,111
before we go in, I think I
should try to explain to you

30
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:50,802
exactly what happened up there.

31
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,137
Oh, it's ok.

32
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:56,147
It was all that wine and escargot.

33
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:58,932
These weren't good shoes anyway.

34
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:02,415
Oh, no, no, no, no. Um,

35
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,223
no. Uh, you know how it is when you're...

36
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:06,387
when you're facing death,

37
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:09,691
how you sometimes say
things without thinking.

38
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:10,855
No.

39
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:15,571
Miss Fine, I thought we were
spending our last moments

40
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,114
on earth together up there,

41
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,538
and so that's why I, um...

42
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,411
you know, said...

43
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:23,064
the thing.

44
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:26,591
The thing?

45
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:31,659
You know, that I felt that
way at that time in that place.

46
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:35,557
Oh, my God! You're taking back the thing?

47
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,516
Well, please, Miss Fine, in... in... in...

48
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,238
in the heat of the moment, sometimes
people just blurt things out.

49
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:43,868
You blurted prematurely?

50
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:47,491
Are you... are you very upset?

51
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:49,454
No, no, I'll be fine.

52
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:51,339
It's perfectly understandable.

53
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:54,201
Uhh, please, don't touch me.

55
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,689
Thanks, Fran. What a beautiful doll.

56
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:49,657
I know.

57
00:03:49,658 --> 00:03:51,667
You know, she's Marie Antoinette.

58
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:55,930
Here you go.

59
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,318
Oh, and lookie here.

60
00:03:57,334 --> 00:04:00,405
This is that restaurant that your
father promised to take me to,

61
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:02,701
but then he changed his
mind and took it back,

62
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,222
which he oft does.

63
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,505
I had made reservations,
but the thing was...

64
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:10,699
There's that thing again.

65
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,376
Fran, I have a report due for school.

66
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:18,138
I'm supposed to pick a woman
with an interesting career.

67
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:19,984
Oh, Gracie,

68
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:23,885
I don't know if there's enough
to write a whole report about me.

69
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:26,337
There isn't. That's why
I picked Miss Babcock.

70
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:29,788
Nanny Fine,

71
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,752
don't be hurt just because I'm
closer to little Gretel than you are.

72
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:37,683
Gretel never said that.

73
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,739
Ooh! Aren't we defensive.

74
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:43,632
There's nothing wrong with
being just a pretty face,

75
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:45,634
in fact, it's a plus if you have no skills.

76
00:04:45,754 --> 00:04:48,287
I've got skills.

77
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,241
Nanny Fine,

78
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:53,647
identifying what's in the
Godivas without a guide

79
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,198
is not a skill.

80
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,044
Oh, nougat.

81
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,706
Oh, come on,

82
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,715
you must know the only
reason you got this job

83
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:04,971
is because of your looks.

84
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:07,252
Hey, hey, that is not true.

85
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:10,028
I got this job because I lied on my résumé.

86
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:13,806
Men of Maxwell's class

87
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:16,661
enjoy keeping women like
you around to flirt with.

88
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,616
You know, you're right.

89
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,238
Now, that's bad because...

90
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:27,303
He doesn't respect you.

91
00:05:27,357 --> 00:05:29,452
Don't you know why you
get away with murder?

92
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:32,733
It's because of those skimpy
little outfits you bounce around in.

93
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:34,362
It's offensive.

94
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:36,356
But, just out of curiosity,

95
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,310
say you were being sued for,

96
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,692
oh, choking a choreographer.

97
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,928
What would you wear to court?

98
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:51,087
Oh, Maxwell, what an
ordeal this flight was.

99
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:53,748
I can't imagine anything more terrifying.

100
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,222
Booga booga booga.

101
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:06,534
C.C., I do hope Chester wasn't
too traumatized by his trip.

102
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:09,831
Although, he didn't seem to mind
being in his little travel bag.

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,282
Ooh!

104
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:14,912
Forgot to unpack him, didn't you?

105
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:17,549
No.

106
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:18,704
Angelica,

107
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,333
you know that suitcase in my closet

108
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:21,085
that you said was growling

109
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:22,924
and I called you an insane old witch...

110
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,439
Niles. Niles, I want you to
order some flowers for Miss Fine.

111
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:32,861
Make it 2 dozen, uh,
sterling roses, long-stemmed.

112
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:35,886
Ooh, somebody was so very bad.

113
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,447
What did you do? Shall I close the door?

114
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:42,666
Yes, just make sure you're
on the other side of it.

115
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:44,302
Oh, come on, sir.

116
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,212
The little crumbs you throw me I live on.

117
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:50,842
Well, I... I just have to make up

118
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:52,758
for something I said to
Miss Fine on the airplane.

119
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:53,665
What did you say?

120
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,729
None of your bloody business.

121
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,210
Was it about me?

122
00:07:00,266 --> 00:07:01,244
No.

123
00:07:01,275 --> 00:07:04,564
Fine. I'll find out anyway. I always do.

124
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:08,606
Oh, Miss Fine. Please, do come in.

125
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,537
Oh, if you're going to smoke a cigar,

126
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:13,121
please, let me snip the end off.

127
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:16,114
In an odd way, I feel it
will make me feel better.

128
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:25,664
Now, I want to ask you
something that's very important,

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,496
but it's private, so give me this lemon.

130
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,087
Ow!

131
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,067
Mr. Sheffield...

132
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,014
Miss Fine, what are you doing over there?

133
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:42,093
Come on, come and sit on my desk, annoy me.

134
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,443
It'll be just like old times.

135
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,569
You mean, "B.T."...

136
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:48,570
before the thing?

137
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:51,091
God, Miss Fine,

138
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:53,302
how long are you going
to torture me with this?

139
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,035
I'm not going to torture you about it.

140
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:57,522
That's why I came in here,
to tell you that I'm over it.

141
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,181
- Oh, really?
- No.

142
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,656
Took it back. How's it feel?

143
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,087
Please, Miss Fine, Cats is
opening in 14 new cities.

144
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,391
I don't feel very strong right now.

145
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,920
All right, let me ask
you this one question.

146
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:16,418
When you hired me,

147
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:19,265
did you think I was just attractive?

148
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:22,306
Absolutely not.

149
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:24,377
I thought you were beautiful.

150
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:28,037
Stunning. Drop-dead gorgeous.

151
00:08:28,798 --> 00:08:30,835
How dare you!

152
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:34,508
Why do you keep trying
to hurt me like this?

153
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,395
It got quiet. Are they talking about me?

154
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:50,763
Oh, I can't believe I'm back
in the meat market again.

155
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:52,144
It's so sad.

156
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:53,998
I mean, the best years of my life,

157
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:55,674
and I spend 90% of them...

158
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:58,869
With a guy who kisses you
passionately and takes it back.

159
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,925
Asks to marry you, takes it back.

160
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:02,227
Tells you he loves you,

161
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:05,105
- takes it...
- I was gonna say talking with you, Val.

162
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,441
But thanks for the postgame wrap-up.

163
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:12,334
You know, the reason why
he keeps taking it back

164
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:16,834
is because I'm nothing but
a pretty plaything to him.

165
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:20,511
I mean, he doesn't take me seriously.

166
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:22,994
Can I have a double apricot sour?

167
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,367
Rim it with sweet 'n low.

168
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:28,649
Come on, let's go get a table

169
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:31,449
before some other yutz tries to pick me up.

170
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:33,327
Too late, ladies.

171
00:09:42,385 --> 00:09:43,804
Hi. I'm Jack.

172
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:45,713
Would you mind if I bought you a drink?

173
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:49,169
Uh, do you mind? We
really want to be alone.

174
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,553
What is it with guys?

175
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:53,051
Why do they always think just
because you're at a singles bar

176
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:55,184
in a cute top, a tight
skirt, and stiletto heels,

177
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:56,805
you're looking for action?

178
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,535
Well, why do women think that
guys expect them to jump into bed

179
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,337
every time they try and buy them a drink?

180
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,974
Now, potato skins, I get you both.

181
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:09,782
I don't think so.

182
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,800
Uh, speak for yourself.

183
00:10:11,847 --> 00:10:14,453
I haven't had a potato skin in three years.

184
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:19,602
No, seriously, you sound
like a very nice woman.

185
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:21,887
And looks really don't matter to me.

186
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,103
Yeah, right. You're only
interested in me for my mind.

187
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:26,914
Like I haven't heard that bef...

188
00:10:27,034 --> 00:10:28,524
actually, I've never heard that.

189
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:32,751
I ordered a drink about
10 minutes ago. Bartender!

190
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:35,831
It's sitting right in front
of you. What are you, blind?

191
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,166
Yes.

192
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:41,657
A sympathy pickup?

193
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:43,410
Pretending to be blind

194
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,754
just so that you could take
home a couple of college girls?

195
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,469
College girls.

196
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,633
Forgive me. I'm very sorry.

197
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:53,596
Val, get a table. This could work.

198
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:55,954
Well, I'll drink to that.

199
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:58,460
Whoa! Watch it! Watch it!

200
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,475
I'd like to order a pair of
the diamond earrings on page 12.

201
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,585
What are you doing, sir?

202
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:15,611
You know, for someone
who's never bloody around

203
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:16,899
when there's no toilet paper,

204
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,474
you're certainly underfoot enough.

205
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:22,663
I'm just ordering something for Miss Fine.

206
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,005
Well, I really don't think

207
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:25,721
that will make up for what you said.

208
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:29,256
Oh, for God's sakes, all I said was...

209
00:11:32,722 --> 00:11:34,108
Nice try.

210
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:36,032
Oh, come on, sir, this is cruel.

211
00:11:36,055 --> 00:11:37,387
Have you no soul?

212
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:39,577
There is a mean streak in you

213
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,144
that is less than beguiling.

214
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:43,597
He told me what he said
to you. Are you all right?

215
00:11:44,272 --> 00:11:46,056
He told you?

216
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,624
Well, I just think that it's pretentious

217
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:52,021
to get a butler from France.

218
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:54,658
And what's gonna happen to you?

219
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:01,662
I mean, who has money
for a butler these days?

220
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,237
Hello, hello.

221
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:05,153
Oh, here, let me get that for you, ma'am.

222
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:07,728
Ooh. What a smashing suit.

223
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,932
You look tired. May I draw you a foot bath?

224
00:12:09,955 --> 00:12:11,072
You know what, I can't do this.

225
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:13,027
Why don't you just shoot me?

226
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:23,204
Nanny Fine, oh, I wish you
could have been there. With...

227
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:27,718
the little one along, I'm more accessible.

228
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:30,534
People think I have a soft, caring side,

229
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:33,055
and then I've got them!

230
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:38,718
Oh, Fran, I never should have said

231
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,192
I'd do my report on her.

232
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,121
How can I take it back?

233
00:12:42,122 --> 00:12:43,667
Oh, ask your father.

234
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:46,435
He's the expert on that category.

235
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,272
Oh, hi, Jack. Come on in.

236
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:56,335
Did you have any trouble finding the place?

237
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:57,832
No more than usual.

238
00:12:59,896 --> 00:13:02,130
Hi, handsome boy.

239
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:04,077
Oh, well, thank you very much.

240
00:13:05,047 --> 00:13:06,944
I wasn't quite sure about the suit.

241
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,671
It is a suit, isn't it?

242
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:12,578
Come on in.

243
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,440
Watch your step. Watch your step.

244
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,256
You know what, maybe
I should stay with you.

245
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,156
I wouldn't want to break anything.

246
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,529
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

247
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,964
You're not gonna break anything.

248
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:24,005
Oh, Franny, I'm so sorry.

249
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:26,728
Oh, that's ok.

250
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:31,126
Accidents happen.

251
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,142
Oh, my God.

252
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:36,633
Miss Fine, what is this mess?

253
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:42,668
Oh, excuse me. I had
no idea you had a date.

254
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:43,560
I knew.

255
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:45,576
How does it feel to be out of the loop?

256
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:50,448
How do you do? I'm Maxwell Sheffield.

257
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:51,441
Hi. I'm Jack...

258
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:53,881
Well, you certainly bounced
back awfully quickly.

259
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,681
Do you mind if we discuss this later?

260
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,555
Fine. What time do you
think you'll be home?

261
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:03,115
Well, I think you lost
the right to know that

262
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:05,108
when you took back the thing.

263
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,474
You're determined to
drive that into the ground.

264
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,103
You give me such mixed messages.

265
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:11,182
Oh, what's the use? Just leave me alone!

266
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:14,044
How do you do?

267
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,138
I'm Niles.

268
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:16,200
Hi.

269
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,762
Do you know what's going
on between her and this guy?

270
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,381
Why, what have you heard?

271
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:28,762
Oh, Jack, you know, you
are so well adjusted.

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,614
I mean, you have your own law firm

273
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:33,630
and, um, you sculpt

274
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,957
and you skydive.

275
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,091
- No, no, no, no. I had to give that up.
- Why?

276
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:38,890
The dog kept throwing up.

277
00:14:39,655 --> 00:14:41,162
Ehh!

278
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:45,367
I'm damn glad I met you.

279
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:47,718
I mean, it's so nice to meet a guy

280
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:49,929
that appreciates you for your inner self

281
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,651
and not just for the way you look:

282
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,442
A nineties Jaclyn Smith.

283
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,747
Well, it really doesn't matter to me.

284
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:59,166
You could weigh a ton.
I can't see you, Fran.

285
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,981
You know, Mr. Sheffield just
thinks of me as an object.

286
00:15:07,171 --> 00:15:09,926
I know. He's only attracted
to you because of how you look,

287
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,268
and it really bugs you.

288
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:14,083
You know, I think you're just going out

289
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:15,045
with a guy who can't see

290
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:16,836
because you think you
have something to prove.

291
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:18,776
Oh, that's not true.

292
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:20,063
Yes, it is.

293
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,467
You're so hung up on this guy.

294
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,907
You've mentioned his name
35 times in the last hour.

295
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,308
Well, it's just that
me and Mr. Sheffield...

296
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:27,675
36.

297
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:30,088
You know, I really think

298
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:32,207
that you should try and convince him

299
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:34,608
that you're more than
just a nineties Kate Smith.

300
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:38,889
You know, I think that you should
know someone a little better

301
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:42,643
before you start pegging them
with such deadly accuracy.

302
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,614
Oh, Jack, I'm so sorry.

303
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,523
I really am using you.

304
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:50,855
How can I ever make it up to you?

305
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,045
It's all right. Forget about it.

306
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:55,465
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

307
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,531
Maybe I can even talk you
into a plate of potato skins.

308
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:01,474
You know, for your information,

309
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:04,496
I am giving you such
a dirty look right now.

310
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:06,474
Ho. What?

311
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:08,568
Oh, it's a bally.

312
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:09,694
Here you go, kids.

313
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:11,222
No, Fran, don't throw the ball!

314
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:12,641
Don't throw the ball!

315
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:20,654
Fran, you're taking this pretty well,

316
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:23,679
being dumped by a blind guy.

317
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:26,721
Ma, don't you see?

318
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:29,221
He has no idea what I look like.

319
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,624
He dumped me for who I really am.

320
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:41,482
Oh. It's Pauly the butcher.

321
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:46,409
Hi, Pauly.

322
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,721
Oh, is that a new apron?

323
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:51,326
It makes you look so svelte.

324
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:55,080
I put an extra breast in...

325
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:59,487
not that you need any
help in that department.

326
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:03,288
Oh, you're terrible.

327
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:07,254
Ma?

328
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:08,757
Now I know why all the other kids

329
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:10,324
were bringing fluffernutters to school

330
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:13,465
while I was bringing veal
medallions on wonder bread.

331
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:18,306
You know, ma, when you flirt

332
00:17:18,314 --> 00:17:19,950
and use your looks like that,

333
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,805
men do not respect you.

334
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:25,287
What's with the women's
lib all of a sudden?

335
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:28,755
When did you become Gloria Estefan?

336
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:36,418
That's Gloria Steinbrenner, ma.

337
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,886
There is nothing wrong

338
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,973
with a woman using her God-given gifts.

339
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,697
Well, apparently, there is,

340
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:50,924
because Mr. Sheffield thinks
that he can say he loves me...

341
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:53,073
Ah! He said he loved you.

342
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,183
Oh, that wonderful man.

343
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:57,067
He took it back.

344
00:17:57,472 --> 00:17:58,946
I'll call Yetta.

345
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,475
She'll put a curse on him.

346
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,582
Don't call Yetta, ma.

347
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,820
I already left a message on her machine.

348
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,767
So, why did he take it back?

349
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:14,942
Because. He doesn't respect me.

350
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,890
To him, I'm just another pretty face.

351
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,163
Darling, that is crap.

352
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,254
Ma, you don't know what
you're talking about.

353
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:27,270
Just drop it.

354
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,242
He took it back because he's a basket case.

355
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:34,578
All right. Pick it up.

356
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,534
We don't have the market
on guilt, you know.

357
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,367
Guilt over the late
wife, guilt over the kids,

358
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,534
guilt over marrying out of his class.

359
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,960
Gee, ma, you know, I think you're right.

360
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:48,131
It isn't me.

361
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:49,401
It's him.

362
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:53,034
I never realized how
tortured and unhappy he is.

363
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:55,306
Oh, this makes me feel so much better.

364
00:18:57,835 --> 00:18:59,728
Oy. It's the cable man.

365
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,364
Ma...

366
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,535
This one's on me.

367
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:11,471
You want free Cinemax?

368
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:21,105
Oh, here you are.

369
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,191
Why don't you come inside?

370
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:24,650
We're about to watch
Twister on the movie channel.

371
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:26,433
We don't get that.

372
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:28,148
We do now.

373
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,554
Listen,

374
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:33,594
I've been thinking about what happened,

375
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:35,006
and...

376
00:19:36,285 --> 00:19:38,070
I understand.

377
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,148
You do?

378
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:43,213
You're emotionally furkhakt.

379
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:49,034
Well, that's a little harsh, Miss Fine.

380
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:51,374
I'm just a little furdrih.

381
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:54,437
Mm, maybe furmisht.

382
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:57,757
All I'm saying is that

383
00:19:57,788 --> 00:19:59,790
you are afraid of your feelings,

384
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:01,659
so you just relate to me superficially.

385
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:03,877
I mean, we flirt, we play games.

386
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,289
I prance around in short skirts,

387
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,167
you let me get away with anything.

388
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:08,105
What?

389
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:11,029
You get into more trouble
than the children, Miss Fine.

390
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:12,922
I punished you just last week.

391
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:16,630
Oh, yeah.

392
00:20:16,653 --> 00:20:18,762
That was when you made
me take those shoes back

393
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:20,539
that I said I bought for Maggie.

394
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:21,663
Right.

395
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:24,409
Just like those, only a different color.

396
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:27,568
Uh... Yeah.

397
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:31,601
You know, Miss Fine, you're right.

398
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:32,562
I am afraid.

399
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,889
That's why I took it back.

400
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,053
I know.

401
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:39,085
I've only really been in love
once in my life before, and,

402
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:41,067
when my wife died...

403
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,855
Well, I'm just afraid

404
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:45,112
of going through all that pain again.

405
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:49,215
And what if it didn't work out between us?

406
00:20:49,223 --> 00:20:50,480
And what about the children?

407
00:20:50,503 --> 00:20:52,597
Well, it would be hard at first,

408
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:55,018
but we'd let you come visit us on weekends.

409
00:20:57,685 --> 00:21:00,889
Oh, Miss Fine, what if
something happened between us?

410
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,395
It could ruin everything we have.

411
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:06,015
Or it could add a whole other dimension

412
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,234
that wouldn't be entirely unpleasant.

413
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:10,476
Or it could ruin it.

414
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:12,632
It's happened before.

415
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,091
So, we agree then?

416
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:17,759
Friends.

417
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:19,148
Friends.

418
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:40,462
- Friends.
- Friends.

419
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:58,684
So why did he take it back?

420
00:21:58,702 --> 00:22:01,965
Because he doesn't respect me.

421
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:06,075
He, uh...

422
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:07,999
We don't have the...

423
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:12,374
And I just popped another
piece of cake in my mouth.

424
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:14,406
What's wrong with me?

425
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:17,594
Oy. It's the cable man.

426
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:19,192
Ma...

427
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,657
This one's on me.

428
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,627
You want some free Cinemax?

429
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:35,121
Who are these people?
