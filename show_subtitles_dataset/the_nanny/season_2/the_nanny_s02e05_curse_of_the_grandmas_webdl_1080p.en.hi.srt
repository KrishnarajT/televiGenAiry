1
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:08,817
Niles.
/ Huh?

2
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:12,450
Brighten says my uniform
makes me look like a dork.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,063
I wear a uniform.
Do I look like a dork?

4
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:21,784
Remember what happened to Gretel ...

5
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:27,521
I see we've customized
our Red Robin uniform.

6
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:30,794
Believe me,
you sell more cookies my way.

7
00:00:30,794 --> 00:00:32,679
Does anybody know what today is?

8
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,235
Another one of your colorful
holidays involving plagues?

9
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:40,859
Hey, don't knock the Jewish holidays.
They get you out of more school than mono.

10
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:46,068
No. One year ago today was the day
that Danny dumped me for Heather Biblow,

11
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:53,249
which would make one year ago tomorrow the day
that Heather found Nair in her Pert Plus,

12
00:00:53,249 --> 00:00:57,951
which would make Friday the day that
she bought her first Ava Gabor wig.

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,867
Grab the wheel, Miss Fine,
you're swerving.

14
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:03,853
Oh. Sorry.

15
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:07,913
Which would make Saturday the first anniversary
of the day that I started to work here.

16
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:11,230
Oh, it seems like only yesterday
when you called the Orkin Man

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,360
when I served escargot.

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,435
I don't care how rich you are, you don't eat
something that leaves a trail of slime behind it.

19
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:22,516
Oh, don't you look adorable in that uniform.

20
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:26,450
Oh, Mr. Sheffield.
/ I was talking to Grace, Miss Fine.

21
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:33,487
Oh ... / But you do look... well, I know
Robin's are always prepared, but for what?

22
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:37,216
Oh, you're just going to have
to earn a merit badge to find out.

23
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,720
It was very sweet of you to volunteer
to be Grace's troop mother, Miss Fine.

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,571
Oh, my pleasure.

25
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:46,839
That's the last time I ever
scratch my armpit in public.

26
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:53,383
Miss Fine, will you be
free Saturday night?

27
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:55,450
Saturday? Why?

28
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,779
Well, I'd rather not discuss it.
I just want to be sure you can be here.

29
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:03,167
I'm all yours, and
I have been for a year.

30
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:07,970
Oh, I can't believe he remembered.
Is he a doll or what?

31
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,910
You know, if he asks, I don't
expect anything Size 5.

32
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:18,650
I have never felt so wanted or
appreciated Bloomingdales, 3rd floor.

33
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:23,588
Well, I just hope he doesn't go
overboard diamonds are forever.

34
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:18,157
Okay, Red Robins, now survival tips.

35
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:21,469
Listen closely because the proper
knot can save your life.

36
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:26,794
You're in the woods, you look around,
all of a sudden you squish a bug right here.

37
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:33,260
Well, the proper slip knot, not
only can conceal those unwanted bug guts,

38
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,732
but it also creates a flattering neckline
and gives the illusion of cleavage.

39
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,074
You're a born leader, Miss Fine.

40
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:44,972
Well, you know, I was leader of
my Weight Watchers group.

41
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,722
You had a weight problem? / Oh, yeah.

42
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:59,370
Not you.
/ Yeah, for my friend...

43
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,232
Mark.
/ Oh, Mark. What are you getting him?

44
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:04,797
Chanel No. 5.

45
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:09,198
Oh, well, perhaps Mark would enjoy
a lighter, more floral scent.

46
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:11,054
Jean Nate, Le Detante.

47
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:15,699
It's the thought that counts.
Take your father's credit card ...

48
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,879
Okay, ladies, now today's field trip

49
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,474
we're going to my grandma's
retirement home,

50
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:29,039
and you're each going to adopt
your very own grandma.

51
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,238
What's the pink tissue for?
/ Oh, give that to your grandma.

52
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:37,020
It makes a lovely wrist and
brassiere strap ornament.

53
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:44,034
Nanny Fine, you are not going to make those
decrepit old ladies feel any younger

54
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:50,740
by bringing in these vibrant, wrinkle
free girls. This is not "Cocoon."

55
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:56,867
Well, how would you feel if you were alone
and forgotten without any friends?

56
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:59,741
Oh, bad example.

57
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:05,521
I know when I'm old I'd rather be
in a dark room with the drapes drawn,

58
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:10,343
the mirrors covered, and a really
big bottle of Nyquil.

59
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,019
Not me. I'm going to be
a platinum blond prune

60
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:20,531
down in Miami just pulling up my tube top
and cha-cha-cha-ing with the cabana boys.

61
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:22,920
I'd rather die young.

62
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,080
And we're all pulling for you.

63
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,026
We don't go young in my family.
No. We Fines like to linger

64
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:39,006
and be a burden to others for
as long as possible.

65
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:46,012
Okay, Red Robins,
now remember your manners.

66
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,836
No loud noises, and whatever you do,
don't unplug anything.

67
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:55,322
Cupcakes, tissues okay, go find
your grandmas and introduce yourselves ...

68
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:57,865
Hi, Grandma Yetta.

69
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,854
Boy, are you a big robin.
What? Were you left back?

70
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:05,779
Yetta, it's Fran.

71
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,787
Fran? Where's Kukla and Ollie.

72
00:06:10,924 --> 00:06:15,735
Yetta, if you're going to live
in the past, pick the Renaissance.

73
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:19,116
Why didn't you sign up for
a Red Robin like everybody else.

74
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:21,683
Because I'm not a joiner.

75
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:28,652
Look at them. Staring at Jeopardy like
they know European Monarchs for 500.

76
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:32,955
Most of them can't remember
their room number.

77
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:36,816
Oh, Gracie, honey, why aren't you
talking to your new grandma?

78
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:40,865
Mrs. Cramer wasn't in her room.
They said she checked out.

79
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:45,876
Maybe she moved to Florida.
/ No. They said she bought a farm.

80
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:50,908
Farm? The woman couldn't grow a wart.

81
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:56,456
Well, maybe she was going to
the well to kick the bucket?

82
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:59,766
Oh, you don't have to paint
me a picture.

83
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:05,430
Gracie, sweetie, the grandma that was
assigned to you passed away.

84
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,343
Oh, can I eat her cupcake?

85
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:12,493
Sure, sweetie.
Kids are so resillent.

86
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:16,815
Honey, I'm so sorry. You were definitely
supposed to get a live one.

87
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:19,597
Fran, Cramer's room was
on a corner.

88
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:22,302
That's cross ventilation, Yetta.

89
00:07:22,302 --> 00:07:24,888
Has anyone moved in yet?

90
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,538
Bye.

91
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,148
Bye, my beautiful Red Robins.

92
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:39,472
Fly... Fly... Fly...

93
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:42,369
the hell out of here.

94
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:49,531
I am guessing the field trip was less than a total
success considering there was a body count.

95
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:53,031
Fran, I don't want to be
a Red Robin anymore.

96
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:56,637
Oh, come on, honey.
One old lady dies on you

97
00:07:56,637 --> 00:08:01,677
and you're already turned off
to the whole Red Robin experience?

98
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:08,178
I'll get it. Sit down and relax.
We'll watch court TV.

99
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:09,077
Who's on?

100
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:13,253
The Menendez boys.
They're back for a second season.

101
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,836
Hello, I'm Mrs. Livingston,
Heather's mother.

102
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:20,577
Oh, come in.

103
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:24,900
Is that Heather with the freckles
or Heather with the extra pinkie?

104
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:29,039
Oh, it's a real treat watching
her sip tea.

105
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:32,823
Miss Fine, this is a little awkward.
We're making a change in our domestic staff,

106
00:08:32,823 --> 00:08:36,348
and the kids all say such great
things about the Sheffield home.

107
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:39,690
Well, in the short year
that I've been here,

108
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,191
I have added a certain element
of style and panache to this house.

109
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,468
Huh? When did I eat corn?

110
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:52,734
Miss Fine, let me finish.
/ No. It's very flattering,

111
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:56,385
but I can't even consider it
even if you doubled my salary

112
00:08:56,385 --> 00:09:01,245
and offered me an Eldorado
in the Bill Blast color scheme,

113
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:04,577
I'd have to turn you down.
Who'd pay the insurance?

114
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,728
Not you, Miss Fine... Niles.

115
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:10,431
Niles would pay my insurance?

116
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:12,895
No, we want Niles.

117
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:15,608
Could you just find out for us
if he's happy here?

118
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:19,217
Oh ... Well, what is it,
that fancy English accent?

119
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:23,958
Because, you know, if I wanted to,
I could talk with an accent too.

120
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:32,210
What was wrong with the blouse
I picked out for Fran?

121
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,929
Oh, no. It was cheap and incredibly tacky.
You could see right through it.

122
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:38,743
And what's the downside of that?

123
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:42,164
I want to get her something
she doesn't already have.

124
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:44,521
Hi, kids.

125
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,100
Fran, if you were ... ah ...

126
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:49,763
Mark?
/ Yeah, Mark.

127
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:53,256
Mark ...
/ Would you like a pair of earrings?

128
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:56,120
Oh, I think Mark would
love the earrings.

129
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,505
Just make sure they're clip-ons.

130
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:00,506
Mark doesn't have pierced ears?

131
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:04,842
No, his lobes are too fatty.
It runs in his family.

132
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:09,303
Mr. Sheffield. I hope
I'm not bothering you

133
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:13,806
like you're talking to some caterer
about something... shrimp cocktail, rumaki.

134
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:18,891
Miss Fine, we're in a bit of a crunch here.
Do you have anything to say
that's even remotely comprehensible?

135
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:22,223
Oh, all right, all right.
But I did want to tell you this in private.

136
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:24,290
Follow my eyes?

137
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,455
What? You don't want to talk
in front of the lamp?

138
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:30,766
What? Oh, Niles, oh, you can
speak freely in front of him.

139
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:35,767
We have no secrets in this house.
/ That's because he listens at the door.

140
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:40,477
How else would I hear you scratching
to get back in?

141
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:49,650
Well, someone is trying to hire away one of
your most valued domestic employees.

142
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,139
Niles.

143
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,093
Well, I didn't say that, but,
yeah, Niles. How'd you guess?

144
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,388
Well, there's scarcely a day goes by when
I don't get a telephone call requesting Niles.

145
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:03,304
An employee of his skills and
breeding is always in demand.

146
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:05,591
I'm hot.

147
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,804
Well, next time you get one of
those calls for me,

148
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:11,786
you just tell them I'm not interested.

149
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:15,005
Will do, Miss Fine.

150
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:18,776
What's so funny?
/ Oh, nothing.

151
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:22,725
No one ever calls for me?
/ Well, actually, there was one.

152
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:24,886
See.
/ Your mother.

153
00:11:24,886 --> 00:11:29,613
Clairol's Loving Care
gives better coverage.

154
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:32,384
What are you telling me that for?

155
00:11:33,431 --> 00:11:36,897
Nanny Fine, I don't want to be rude
/ Huh, since when?

156
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,863
You're right. Get out.

157
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,493
We need to talk about Saturday night.
What time do you want me here?

158
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:45,383
She's coming? Oh, we're going to have
to talk about this guest list.

159
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:49,129
Well, of course, Miss Babcock's coming.
She made all the arrangements.

160
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:51,885
Oh, boy, did I have you
pegged all wrong.

161
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:56,629
Isn't it the people you hate on sight
that become your lifelong friends.

162
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,762
Not always.

163
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,663
Maxwell, the limousine will pick us
up at the airport in Washington.

164
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:06,025
Washington?
/ Yes. Well, you may as well know.

165
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:11,054
The Center for Performing Arts has
nominated us for its highest award.

166
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:15,664
Is that what you wanted me
for on Saturday night? To baby-sit?

167
00:12:15,664 --> 00:12:19,396
No. We wanted you to fly the jet.

168
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:23,078
Miss Fine, I didn't say anything to you
before about the nomination

169
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:27,347
because it's bad luck, you know,
we've been overlooked so many times before.

170
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:29,291
You've been overlooked?

171
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,019
Is there a problem, Miss Fine?
Do you have plans Saturday night.

172
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,241
Oh, yeah, I'm going to heat
up a Lean Cuisine

173
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:39,243
and see what kind of frontier mishegaas
Dr. Quinn has gotten herself into.

174
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:53,416
Gracie, you're going to love
your new grandma, Mrs. Klein.

175
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,919
Now do you remember what
I told you to ask her?

176
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,285
Is she related to Calvin and can
we get a discount. / Excellent.

177
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:04,575
Good morning. And how are
you two ladies doing today?

178
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,416
Fine, Daddy.
/ I've been better.

179
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:11,412
Is everything... everything all right,
Miss Fine? / Oh, whatever.

180
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,630
Miss Fine, is there
something bothering you?

181
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,610
No, what could possibly be
bothering me? (Mumble.)

182
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,925
I beg your pardon?
/ Nothing.

183
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:26,888
Miss Fine, you've barely spoken
a word to me in 12 hours.
It's beginning to scare me.

184
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:28,989
I have no idea what you're talking about.

185
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:31,903
I invited my mother. I'll never hear
the end of it. Come on, Gracie.

186
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:35,490
Miss Fine, you are not leaving this house
until I know why you're so upset with me.

187
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:40,205
I'm not upset with you. You're the best
boss anyone could possibly ask for.

188
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:42,815
Eat tripe and die.

189
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:53,646
Now, Gracie, I had
Mrs. Klein thoroughly checked out.

190
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:58,566
She's cute, she's sweet, and
she's healthy as a horse.

191
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:06,148
You know, she holds the retirement home
record for most reps on the thigh burner.

192
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:07,982
One.

193
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:13,043
Oh ... Grandma Yetta.

194
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:16,744
We're here to introduce Gracie
to her new grandma, Mrs. Klein.

195
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:22,135
Oh, yeah? Well, if you want to talk to her,
you're going to need a Ouija board.

196
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:26,195
She never should have gone
for that second rep.

197
00:14:26,516 --> 00:14:28,407
Another one?

198
00:14:28,407 --> 00:14:31,596
What if it's me?
What if I'm a jinx?

199
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:36,708
Oh, no, honey,
now that is just ridiculous.

200
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,025
There's no such thing. Poi, poi.

201
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:45,510
People here are old and sick.
They can go at any time, in the next minute.

202
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,084
Would you go cheer somebody else up.

203
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:56,423
Sweetie, you're an adorable little girl and
anyone would love to be your grandma; right?

204
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:10,333
You're not a jinx, and just to prove it to you,
I'm going to give you my very own grandma.

205
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,137
Yetta ...

206
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,879
Damn crepe soles stick like gum.

207
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,239
Honey, I'd love to be your grandma.

208
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:24,801
I've lived a good life.

209
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:29,067
So then she said that Heather was a liar,

210
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:34,409
so then Heather said — no,
wait — oh, yeah

211
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,780
— no, wait — oh, yeah.

212
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:39,115
Let me start again.

213
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:43,919
See, honey, you're not
a jinx because I'm not dead.

214
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:47,027
And I wish I was.

215
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:52,254
Honey, why don't we play some
hide-and-go-seek. / Okay. I'll hide.

216
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:54,516
Good choice, sweetie.

217
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:59,403
So what's the matter?
/ Who said anything's the matter?

218
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:03,187
Franny, I know I like
the back of my hand.

219
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:06,165
Geez, I never noticed that before.

220
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,034
So, anyway, what is it?
Man trouble?

221
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:13,260
How could he not know
what's bothering me.

222
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,138
I don't know. It's because
I'm like all the Fine women.

223
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:18,942
We're just too damn settle.

224
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:21,951
It's a waste of time talking to men.

225
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:26,166
First of all,
they aren't that interesting.

226
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:32,166
Sixty-two years I was married to your
grandfather, we didn't say two words.

227
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,631
The man had no communication skills.

228
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:37,910
That's true.
If only he'd been able to say

229
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,243
"I'm choking on a chicken bone,"
he'd be alive today.

230
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:46,040
So what is it?
Your sex life stinks?

231
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,366
Grandma, he doesn't sleep with me.

232
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:52,354
Not even on your birthday?
/ No.

233
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:56,394
That's a bad marriage.
/ We're not married.

234
00:16:56,394 --> 00:17:00,902
Look at me, I'm hanging on every word
like I'm talking to Yoda.

235
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:19,414
May I help you, sir?
/ Oh, that's all right, Niles.

236
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,065
I'm just counting forward
28 days from the last time

237
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:26,045
Miss Fine seemed to hate my guts
for no apparent reason.

238
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,389
No, that will be next week.

239
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:31,744
Um, something to look forward to, sir.

240
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:35,307
Cee Cee, maybe you can shed
some light on this. I mean you're a woman.

241
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:38,694
I'm still waiting for
the DNA results.

242
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:44,121
You men just don't get it.
She doesn't hate you.

243
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,806
It's her life.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

244
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:50,401
She has a dead-end job
with no prospects.

245
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:53,705
She's working for a man
who hardly knows she's alive.

246
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:56,349
Her own dog hates her.

247
00:17:56,349 --> 00:18:00,414
A blind date stole her stereo.

248
00:18:01,962 --> 00:18:05,206
Who was I talking about again?

249
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:08,627
Think back, sir,
one year ago today

250
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:13,668
someone's spike heel dug its first
divot into the parquet floor.

251
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:16,346
I thought you were
going to get that fixed.

252
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,334
Come closer.

253
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:26,088
One year to the day since we first
learned if it ain't half off, it ain't on sale.

254
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:29,951
Would you just... would you just
get to the point, old man.

255
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:32,478
Work with me, sir.

256
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,697
It's her anniversary.

257
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,695
Oh, Niles, don't be preposterous.

258
00:18:38,695 --> 00:18:42,703
I mean you've been working here forever,
and I haven't the faintest idea when you started.

259
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:48,041
You don't go off all halfcocked.
/ I keep the hurt inside, sir.

260
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:55,007
You also forget my birthday.
I suppose that's all right too.

261
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:57,838
Come on, Niles.

262
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:02,039
Are you seriously telling me that Miss Fine
is the type of person to hold it over my head

263
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,874
just because I...

264
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:08,024
oh, God, is it too late
to send flowers?

265
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:12,099
Maxwell, have you lost your mind?
She is the nanny.

266
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:17,351
I have been your partner for ten years,
and we've never celebrated a damn thing.

267
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:19,288
Get it?

268
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:26,265
Perhaps I can still pick something
up at Bloomingdales.

269
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,240
Maxwell, we have to get to the airport.

270
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,969
You are not going to miss this ceremony.
I can't walk down the aisle alone.

271
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:36,226
I say prepare for the inevitable.

272
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:50,091
Kids, hurry up.
Your father's on, and he won...

273
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,432
I hope his fly is open.

274
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:58,691
Oh, doesn't daddy look handsome?
/ Uh-huh. No Pierce Brosnan.

275
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:05,167
Oh, there's Cee Cee.
/ Oh, my, the camera does put on ten pounds.

276
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:09,623
It just doesn't distribute it.

277
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:17,127
I'd like to thank the Center for
the Performing Arts for this most
gracious recognition,

278
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:20,138
and I'd like to thank
my three wonderful children,

279
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:22,990
and a very special
thanks to the woman

280
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,597
without whose help
I wouldn't be here tonight...

281
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:29,130
Miss Fran Fine.

282
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,554
Oh ...

283
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:34,691
Happy anniversary, Miss Fine.

284
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:40,303
Cee Cee fainted.
/ Oh, my God.

285
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:46,601
And that, ladies, is why you must
always wear your underwear.

286
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,569
Oh, congratulations, sir.
/ Thank you.

287
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:59,947
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, that was so sweet
of you to mention my anniversary.

288
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:02,031
But, you know, you really
didn't have to.

289
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:06,123
I mean those things
aren't important to me.

290
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,687
Well, they are important to me.

291
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,761
It's been a marvelous year,
Miss Fine,

292
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:13,969
and you are a wonderful nanny,
and I'm sorry if I don't say it enough.

293
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:19,151
Oh, well, if I'm so wonderful,
how come nobody wants to hire me away?

294
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:20,766
Oh, well, that? / Yeah.

295
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:25,485
Well, there's a very simple
explanation to that.

296
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,548
As a matter of fact,
it's so simple

297
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:32,786
that explaining it to you would
really be rather insulting.

298
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,586
Go ahead.

299
00:21:36,401 --> 00:21:45,134
Um, well, the reason that you haven't had
any other job offers is simply because, ah ...

300
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:48,552
Niles, is there any more tea?

301
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:51,650
I'll go to China and see.

302
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:58,095
Hi.

303
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:03,656
Well, just look at you, Miss Fine.

304
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:08,829
I mean, I mean I am a single father,
but what married woman in her right mind

305
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:13,876
would want someone as attractive as you
in her home right under her husband's nose?

306
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:20,781
Oh, well, now, now that you mention it.

307
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:24,775
Well, when you're right,
you're right.

308
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:28,840
Good night, Mr. Sheffield ... Niles.
/ Good night, Miss Fine.

309
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:33,733
Nice, save, sir.
/ I came up with that at the last minute.

310
00:22:33,914 --> 00:22:36,917
I heard that ...

311
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:57,701
Brighten!
