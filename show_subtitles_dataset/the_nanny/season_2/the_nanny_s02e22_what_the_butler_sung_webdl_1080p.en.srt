1
00:00:00,416 --> 00:00:06,393
When I was 17,
it was a very good year ...

2
00:00:06,393 --> 00:00:09,386
Niles, that's incredible.

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:13,131
All day long with the butler act
and then this voice comes out of you?

4
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:17,801
You got a real James Nabors-Gomer
Pile thing going on there.

5
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,210
Surprise! Surprise!

6
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:22,137
Oh, don't make me laugh.

7
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:26,006
I just hung up the phone from
my sister Nadine. You know, the caterer?

8
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,337
Her husband left her.
/ Oh, dear.

9
00:00:28,337 --> 00:00:30,837
Oh, I'll tell you,
it doesn't surprise me.

10
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:34,026
Barry is the biggest low life,
and I should know.

11
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:38,438
I dated him for six months before
Nadine stole him away from me.

12
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:41,634
Miss Fine — /Oh, and, you know,
if only there was a way

13
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:46,297
that I can finagle her to come stay
with us for a couple of day. I really owe her.

14
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:49,504
I mean, we came from the same
womb, but she was 13 pounds.

15
00:00:49,504 --> 00:00:52,751
After her, mom was a water slide.

16
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:56,792
Why do you think I have such
a beautiful forehead?

17
00:00:57,235 --> 00:01:00,680
Miss Fine — / You know,
Niles, this party mix ain't bad,

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,337
but I think you OD'd
a little on the cinnamon.

19
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:06,321
You're eating the potpourri.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,338
Ah, it's fiber.

21
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:15,470
Oh, this is the last thing I needed
to see first thing in the morning.

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,906
Well, why don't you
stagger her work hours, sir?

23
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:24,043
My main singer's dropped
out of our backers' audition.

24
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,432
I can't believe he just
left us in the lurch.

25
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:30,055
Oh, well, why don't you use Niles?
/ Niles?

26
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:33,319
No, no, you misunderstood.
He said left us in the lurch.

27
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,938
Not get us lurch.

28
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:40,868
Uggg!

29
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:46,903
Well, you know, I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

30
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:49,990
But maybe I shouldn't open my mouth.
Who knows if he'd even want to do it?

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,942
Yes, I do is love my work.

32
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:57,513
Mr. Sheffield, he could have
made a fortune with his voice,

33
00:01:57,513 --> 00:02:00,556
but instead the man
chose to serve you.

34
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:05,158
He's not a smart man,
but a very talented one.

35
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,697
Oh, Miss Fine, do be serious.
We need someone with a legit voice.

36
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:12,996
And the world would be better for this ...
/Someone who can emote.

37
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:17,594
that one man scorned and covered with stars ...
/ Sullied to the back of the house.

38
00:02:17,594 --> 00:02:21,953
still strode with
his last ounce of courage ...

39
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:23,241
Sing out, Louise!

40
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:29,306
who will reach
the unreachable star.

41
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,158
Oh, bravo!

42
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,018
Niles ...
/ Yeah?

43
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:49,098
Perhaps you should take a look
at the sheet music. / Really?

44
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:54,761
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you know,
I was just thinking,
with Niles rehearsing your song,

45
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:58,666
who's going to do all the cooking?
/ Well, you could help us out, Miss Fine.

46
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:04,015
Oh, you know, I'd love to. But remember,
this is me making Lipton's.

47
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:06,112
Um ... Well, I suppose
I'll just have to hire someone.

48
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,274
Oh, no. A stranger with all the expensive
stuff you got laying around here?

49
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:14,278
I mean, things I broke alone —

50
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:21,843
gee, if only one of us was
related to a caterer ... What?

51
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:24,120
Isn't your sister a caterer?

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,341
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you know, that's
why I'm working for you, bro.

53
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:27,151
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah,
yah, yah, yah, yah, yah ...

54
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:31,231
Oh, Niles, that's so beautiful.

55
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:33,450
Gee, you know,
if you put on a yamauch,

56
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,381
you could be a cantor
at Temple Beth Shalom.

57
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:41,662
Hey, Fran, what do you think of
this blouse? / Well, that depends.

58
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:47,185
You planning on wearing it with a leather
mini-skirt or just leggings? Ha, ha, ha.

59
00:04:47,185 --> 00:04:49,983
It's not for me. It's for a girl I like.
It's for her birthday.

60
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:52,770
Well, B, this is see-through.

61
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,695
Oh, man ...

62
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:59,737
I didn't even notice that.
/ Yeah, yeah.

63
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:04,501
Can you believe that kid? Wanting to buy
a see-through blouse for a little girl?

64
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:07,342
Boy, that reminds me of
my ex-boyfriend, Danny.

65
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:11,635
Do you know for my birthday once
he actually bought me a G-string?

66
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:13,299
Oh, dear, how inappropriate.

67
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:18,563
Oh, I'll tell you, if it wasn't my mother's
birthday in two days, I'd still be stuck with it.

68
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:25,203
That's Nadine.

69
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,533
She's a leaner.

70
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:31,646
Hi, angel.
/ Hi, Nay.

71
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:32,316
Moi!

72
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:38,386
Oh, Nay, I'm so sorry about
you and Barry busting up.

73
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:41,470
Please, I'm fine. Does this disposal work?

74
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,394
Yeah. Why?

75
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:49,122
Well, at least you've
made peace with it.

76
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:51,486
Come meet Niles, the butler.
/ How do you do?

77
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:53,874
I take pills.
/ Oh.

78
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:57,760
Niles, who does my sister look like?

79
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,635
Your mother?
/ Niles, doesn't she feel bad enough?

80
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:08,481
A pair of falsies?
/ Farrah Fawcett!

81
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:13,721
Oh, yeah, this is remarkable.
/ Everyone says that.

82
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:17,224
Nay, come on, sit down.
I'm so happy that you're here.

83
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:19,621
It's good you got to get away
for a couple of days.

84
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:21,663
I'm sure you're going to
miss the girls, though.

85
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:26,197
Nah, they look like Barry.
That makes it easier.

86
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:29,889
Still, it must be hard on them.
/ Divorce is tough.

87
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,766
No. I mean because
they're staying with Ma. Ha!

88
00:06:34,526 --> 00:06:37,742
How did we make it out of there
without turning into two yentas.

89
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:40,800
Yoi, I tell ya.

90
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:46,653
stay at YMCA, yeah ...

91
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,692
Those were the days, my friend.

92
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:53,281
Oh, I thought they'd never end.

93
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,519
Say, you know,
Loeman's got in that big shipment.
Did you go over there on Thursday?

94
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,192
No. I had a barbecue.

95
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:04,073
I piled all of Barry's clothes outside
his mother's house, and I set them on fire.

96
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:07,186
Well, as long as you're not bitter.

97
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:11,264
Barry and I stopped having sex
two years ago. Do you know why?

98
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:15,462
Because you had that thing on
your stomach that needed to be drained?

99
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,412
No. That didn't bother him.

100
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:23,421
It was because he couldn't
perform his animal husbantry.

101
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:25,763
Yeah. Well, that was because
he was performing nightly

102
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:29,763
with that trampy salesgirl
from Wilson's House of Suede.

103
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:32,855
What salesgirl?
/ Nothing.

104
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,961
Fran, make her give it back.
/ What?

105
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:38,816
Ow! You're hurting me.
/ Oh, Fran, that could be us.

106
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:42,591
No. You used to schlepp me
around by my nostrils. / Oh.

107
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,969
Ow!

108
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:48,117
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
What's the matter?

109
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:51,624
Gracie stole my lipstick.
/ No, I didn't.

110
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:56,396
Fran, don't you think she's
a little young to be wearing makeup?

111
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:59,191
Don't you think she's a little
young to let her boyfriend —

112
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,807
You know, what, Fran?
I think I can handle this.

113
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,078
All right. Listen to me.
I want you to be nicer to your sister

114
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:07,388
because someday you
may need an organ,

115
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,852
and your brother has
a different blood type.

116
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:13,394
Come here. Look at me and Nay.
/ Love you, angel. Give me a kidney.

117
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:16,024
Take two. / Moi!

118
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:20,745
Oh, doesn't that just take you back?

119
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,340
I remember you were
always stealing my stuff.

120
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,998
Nay, what are you
doing with my sweater?

121
00:08:25,998 --> 00:08:28,257
My sweater.
/ No, it's not.

122
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:31,467
I remember you gave it to me.
/ I did not.

123
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:34,107
Did too.
/ You lier. Now give that to me. / No.

124
00:08:34,107 --> 00:08:38,017
Give it to me. It's mine. Oh, good.
/ Okay. You win.

125
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,325
Hey, Nay ...

126
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:42,754
Into the pool.

127
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:45,778
Stop it. You animal, you.

128
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:50,468
Say uncle. / Drop dead.
/ I'll spit on you. / Ma!

129
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,502
Hi girls. Did you work out
your little problem?

130
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,237
I'm the greatest star;

131
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:22,508
I am by far.
Take a bow, take it now.

132
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:26,532
But no one knows — good morning.

133
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:29,601
Niles, tea.
/ Yes, I'd love some.

134
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:33,635
My throat's a little dry
and throw in a sprig of mint.

135
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:36,162
I'm not getting you tea.

136
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:39,731
Well, I'm not singing in your show.

137
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,233
Lemon?

138
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,017
Yes. But we're out. Here's $10.

139
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,735
Get a little rawhide chewy for yourself.

140
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:58,321
It's okay, Nay.
I didn't fill the bathtub up for me.

141
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,599
Butch and Sundance
might be coming by,

142
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:04,208
and I thought they might want
to water their horses.

143
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,727
I take it Ava and Zsa Zsa
are not hitting it off?

144
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:12,867
Oh, you know, Niles, my sister has
always wanted everything that I've had —

145
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:17,063
my clothes, my toys.
Once I actually got a shag haircut

146
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:19,625
just because I knew she'd
look lousy in it.

147
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:24,565
Took me 12 weeks to grow it out,
but she looked like Cousins Etz.

148
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,031
Oh, I'll tell you,
if she could, she would be me.

149
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:31,058
Oh, Miss Fine, I'm sure you're
exaggerating. / No, I'm not —

150
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:33,515
Good morning, Nadine.

151
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,111
Good morning, Nadine. Would you
like a freshly baked croissant?

152
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:40,169
Oh, that sounds fabu.
Sure it's no trouble?

153
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:44,612
Oh, not at all. When Miss Babcock
comes back, I'll send her back out.

154
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,416
Nay, maybe this wasn't such
a good idea you staying here after all.

155
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,400
What do you mean?
/ I mean, maybe you should leave.

156
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,117
I don't understand.
/ That's why you did so poorly

157
00:10:55,117 --> 00:11:00,209
on the "$20,000 Pyramid" and Betty
White wanted to punch you out.

158
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:03,888
Why are you doing this to me?
My husband is leaving me.

159
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:07,164
Oh, Nay, relax.
You'll find someone else.

160
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:10,124
You can cook your way
into the heart of any man.

161
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:13,102
Easy for you to say.
You're so lucky.

162
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:17,798
You're living like Ellie Mae Clampett.
You've got a gorgeous guy.

163
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:22,602
Oh, I do? Where? Where?
/ Good morning, ladies.

164
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:26,133
Mr. Sheffield? He's my boss.

165
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:30,210
So there's nothing going
on between you and him? / No.

166
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,285
Then you don't mind if I go after him?

167
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:48,401
Do I smell fas-fas la pesto?

168
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:51,486
No. She don't come till Thursday.

169
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,587
Mr. Sheffield, bubby, come here.

170
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:56,339
Taste this.

171
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:05,200
Ummmmm ...
/ Ummmmm.

172
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,509
It is good, isn't it?
/ Uh-huh. Yuk!

173
00:12:10,034 --> 00:12:11,565
Miss Fine, is there something wrong?

174
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:15,795
No. I'm sorry. It's just that
I ate a really big piece of fat.

175
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,915
That's where all the flavor is.

176
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:22,630
What's the matter, Nadine?
Need to get that thing drained again?

177
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:28,096
Keep an eye on my dumplings.
I just want to run up to my room. / Uh-huh.

178
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:33,469
My room, Nay. And by the way,
your dumplings are down to your knees.

179
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,774
Miss Fine, your sister
is a wonderful cook.

180
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:38,886
Where on earth have you been keeping her?

181
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:43,031
In a jar with air holes on the top.

182
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,752
I beg your pardon?

183
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,870
Can't you see what she's doing?

184
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,331
She is throwing herself at you.
/ She's cooking for me.

185
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:55,761
Yeah, well, nothing says loving
like something from the oven.

186
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:58,526
You're off your bloody rocker.
You know that?

187
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:01,539
Thank God you're not operating
heavy machinery. / Uh-huh.

188
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:04,268
Just raising my children.

189
00:13:04,878 --> 00:13:10,397
Oh, you know, Niles, there is
something to be said for sibling riflery.

190
00:13:10,397 --> 00:13:12,203
You mean rivalry, Miss Fine.

191
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:15,577
No, I mean ... boom!

192
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:36,343
Whoa!

193
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:40,221
Nadine, is there something
I could do for you?

194
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:44,020
Um, I thought you might want a little
something to nibble on before bed.

195
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:48,911
Good night, Mr. Sheffield.
Good night, Nay.

196
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,573
Nadine!
/ I thought Mr. Sheffield might be hungry.

197
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:55,240
Actually, I'm still
quite full from dinner.

198
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,646
What? There's always room for Jell-O?

199
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:03,510
How dare you come into my boss's room
dressed like you're over 30 and desperate.

200
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,487
Here. Cover yourself up.

201
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,266
Oh ...

202
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,317
It was a two-for-one sale.

203
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:19,133
I have nothing to be ashamed of.
I have a beautiful figure.

204
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:22,037
She's not the only one
with a body for days. / Ssshhh.

205
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:25,735
Don't tell my boss
I've got a body for days.

206
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:28,315
He's not blind.

207
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:30,895
Now, come on, let's go. Let's go.
/ Hey, who you pushing?

208
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,345
Hey, hey. / Hey, hey, hey, hey.

209
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,791
Ladies, ladies ...

210
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:38,727
Ladies, can we take this outside
or to a mud pit somewhere?

211
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,421
Oh, need an extra pillow, sir?

212
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:47,512
Good night, Niles. / Well, you know,
actually I'm not very tired.

213
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,510
Good night, Niles.

214
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:54,726
Would you excuse us? I'd like
a moment alone with your sister, please.

215
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,926
You heard him. Get out.

216
00:14:56,926 --> 00:15:01,852
I think he's talking to me, Nay. Right?

217
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:06,504
Good night, Mr. Sheffield.
If you want me, I'll be in my room.

218
00:15:06,504 --> 00:15:09,558
My room, Nay.

219
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,749
Well, congratulations, Miss Fine.

220
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:15,071
You were right about your sister.

221
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:17,942
Is there anyone in your family
who's not a raving lunatic?

222
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,676
Hey ...

223
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:22,807
I'll have to get back to you
on that one. Hey ...

224
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,834
You know, if she wasn't
such a damn fine caterer,

225
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,871
I'd throw her out before
this backers' audition.

226
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:30,202
Gee, you know, this is the first time
I've ever been in your bedroom.

227
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:32,843
It's not at all as
I imagined it to be.

228
00:15:32,843 --> 00:15:37,362
It's got a whole James Bond
"Octopusy" thing going on.

229
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:40,353
Get out.
/ Bye.

230
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:49,297
Me, me, me, me, me, me;

231
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:52,140
me, me, me, me, me, me.

232
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:56,070
Ah, who's going to get the door?
/ You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you.

233
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,146
So, Niles, nervous?

234
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:04,161
Oh, no. I look at this as a chance
to fulfill the dream of a lifetime, sir.

235
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,788
Oh, I hate backers' auditions —

236
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:10,211
ah, so much pressure,
so much riding on it,

237
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:12,776
so many lives, so many jobs,

238
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:16,939
all depending on this one night.

239
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:19,274
Well, carry on.

240
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:28,735
You, know, if mommy knew the way her
eldest daughter behaved last night,

241
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:31,823
I'll tell you, she'd be so mortified,

242
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:36,721
she would just pack her bags
and move down to Florida.

243
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,076
Call Ma ...

244
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:45,243
I didn't know mommy had two daughters.

245
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:49,445
She was so busy pulling up your dress
and showing off your thighs to everyone.

246
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:54,736
This you envied? To this day
I can't wear a short dress.

247
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,818
You called Barry?

248
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:06,306
I had to, Nadine. It's time you
go home and face your demons.

249
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:10,814
Oh, nice thing to call your nieces.
/ I didn't mean them. Although ...

250
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,122
Did somebody call for
an air conditioning repair —

251
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:15,425
Fran?

252
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,103
Nay?

253
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:20,267
Bar ...

254
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:25,076
So, this is how I find you,

255
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:28,021
in another man's kitchen.
/ I'm getting paid.

256
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:31,074
There's a word for that.

257
00:17:31,074 --> 00:17:36,416
Yeah, Barry, it's called caterer.
/ Oh, yeah, her big career.

258
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:40,342
You, don't know what it used to be like.
I got it every night.

259
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:44,346
All right, all right. That's more than
I needed to hear about my brother-in-law.

260
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:48,075
My wife is serving it up to half
of Long Island, and I'm going hungry.

261
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:50,972
Buzz off.
/ All right. You're talking.

262
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:53,514
This is good.
/ Shut up.

263
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:58,676
All right. They're going into
the backers' audition. This is bad.

264
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:04,756
Act I. Curtain. It's a gorgeous
ballad sung by Niles ...

265
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,494
Niles Butler, Niles DeButler.
Ladies and Gentlemen ...

266
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:23,061
Once in every man's lifetime,

267
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:26,461
mystery and magic abound.

268
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:29,515
Destiny finds and shows him ...

269
00:18:29,515 --> 00:18:33,140
true love has been found.

270
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,409
I never should have married you.
/ Once in a man's lifetime romance and ...

271
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,237
I don't ask for much —
pizza, a turkey once in a while ...

272
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:46,341
I'm sick of feeding your face,
Barry. What do I care?

273
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:48,205
You know, shut up.

274
00:18:48,205 --> 00:18:50,905
Mr. Sheffield's out there
with a bunch of rich people

275
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:53,814
trying to shake them down.

276
00:18:55,251 --> 00:19:03,781
It's as pure and as simple as
learning to follow your heart ...

277
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:08,026
Oh, once in a lifetime ...
/ Don't worry, Maxwell, I'll handle this quietly.

278
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,105
Nanny Fine!

279
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:18,859
that once in a lifetime
feeling has come over me.

280
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:28,859
That once in a life time
feeling has come over me ...

281
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:36,515
Miss Fine, I am beyond words.

282
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:41,883
This is the most outrageous
horrific unconscionable display.

283
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:44,411
I thought you said you
were beyond words.

284
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:48,415
Here, Maxwell, go for it.
Club her big-haired head.

285
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,180
C.C., rich people out there.
Don't let them leave.

286
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,954
Got ya.

287
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:59,020
Excuse me, sir.
How do you think it went?

288
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,634
Didn't you notice Larry, Moe,
and Curly going on in the background?

289
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,639
Well, yes. But how was I?

290
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:10,760
You were terrific, old man.
We'll call you. / Yes.

291
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,072
So this is the guy
you're cooking for now?

292
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:18,203
Barry Cooperman.
How's it hanging?

293
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:21,081
Maxwell Sheffield. Not well.

294
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:24,805
Has he got an appetite as big as mine?

295
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:29,936
No ones is, Barry. He's gotta have
it four or five times a day.

296
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:34,425
No, kidding. Boy, he's satisfied with
just two poached eggs and a piece of toast.

297
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,305
That's it?
/ Yeah.

298
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:40,604
Then he just rolls
over and goes to sleep.

299
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:44,307
Barry, don't be jealous because
she's dishing it out to other men.

300
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:49,730
There's plenty left over for you.
And you, Nay, you want your man back,

301
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:54,322
you gotta put it out for him —
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

302
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:59,726
And I miss my midnight snacks.

303
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,519
Oh, Barry, I've been neglecting you.

304
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:08,146
From now on you'll get it any time
you want right there on the kitchen table.

305
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:15,717
Speaking of food, which I hope to God
we're speaking of, could we get some out there?

306
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:20,125
Of course, Mr. Sheffield,
everything but my pate.

307
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,857
That's for my husband.

308
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,523
Oh ...

309
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:28,294
Baby, that is good.

310
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:30,903
Ohhhh ...

311
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:35,249
I just gotta get a few things
out of my room.

312
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:38,156
My room, Nay.

313
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:41,247
Maxwell, you're never going to believe this.

314
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:45,006
First, they hated Niles' song —
I get to tell him.

315
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:50,639
Second, they loved that whole comedy
thing going on in the background.

316
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:54,663
They are throwing money at us.
You better get out there.

317
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:59,616
Well!
/ You were saying?

318
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:02,394
I better get out there.

319
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:10,758
Oh, I'm the greatest star,

320
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:14,382
I am by far —
raise my pay, start today.

321
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:19,031
But no one knows — here ...

322
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,409
Ma, you're never going to believe this.

323
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:34,576
Nadine walked herself into
Mr. Sheffield's bedroom

324
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:40,378
in a flimsy negligee carrying
a roast rack of lamb.

325
00:22:40,378 --> 00:22:43,062
What do you mean why didn't
