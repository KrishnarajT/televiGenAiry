1
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:10,947
Okay, kids, come one, come on.
Everyone hold on to me.

2
00:00:10,947 --> 00:00:14,595
Not you, you pervert.

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,123
Wow! This is so cool.
Dad never let's us take the subway.

4
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:20,328
Well, the entire city is in gridlock.

5
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:23,085
I don't know who schedules
a gay pride parade on the same day

6
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:26,458
they're unveiling
a Calvin Klein billboard.

7
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:27,951
Give me a dollar!

8
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,750
Don't worry, kids,
I'll take care of this.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,707
What am I, Santa Claus?
You give me a dollar!

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,631
Yeah!

11
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:42,610
You weren't even afraid of him.

12
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,800
Oh, honey, just cause
he yelled in my face?

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,662
You obviously have never seen
my mother watch "The Price is Right."

14
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:51,676
Oh, it's creepy down here.

15
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,060
Oh, honey, the subway's not creepy.

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,735
It's just that nobody
gives a damn anymore.

17
00:00:56,735 --> 00:01:00,239
What do I do with my soda?
/ Just leave it on the floor.

18
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:06,257
Oh, would you look at that poor woman
with all those kids and bags.

19
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:07,927
Hold your sister a minute.

20
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:10,312
Excuse me. Can I give you a hand?

21
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:18,302
Can I hold something for you?

22
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:21,979
Oh, wow. I would have
given me the salami,

23
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,504
but you're a lot cuter.

24
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,512
You see, kids, one simple act of kindness
and already the world is a better place.

25
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:35,751
Of course this is America,
she could speak English.

26
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:42,556
Hi, you're sweet.
Oh, good, a seat.

27
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:48,227
Yes, you're such a doll;
you're such a doll.

28
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:52,665
That's right, shaupaneua.

29
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:04,805
Oh, what a shaupaneua,

30
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,963
what a little bubbula.

31
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:10,305
Excuse me, Yentel.

32
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,534
Yeah? What?

33
00:02:12,534 --> 00:02:14,310
Where's the mother?

34
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,382
Oh, my God.
She abandoned her baby.

35
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:21,562
Ah, what is
this world coming to.

36
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:24,738
The salami she guards
with her life.

37
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:26,550
What are we going to did?

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,918
Oh, you poor defenseless
little thing. Ow!

39
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,778
Someone's hungry.

40
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:38,103
Can you believe that wasn't the first time
that ever happened to me in the subway.

41
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:30,201
Oh, I can't believe
I'm holding a baby.

42
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,532
Not my blankie.

43
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:42,017
Oh, God, I can't believe
you still have that thing.

44
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:44,767
And, Brighten, bring down
the Snoopy up in your closet.

45
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,862
What Snoopy up in my closet?

46
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,295
You know, you're
just like my mother.

47
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,996
What Nestles Crunch bar
under my Nordic Track? Go ...

48
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:55,986
Oh, what a day I had today.

49
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,876
Oh, let me guess.
Yard sale at Mia Farrow's?

50
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:06,563
Maggie, go see
if you can find some bottles.

51
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:10,116
Niles, do we have any old nipples
around the house?

52
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,657
Hello, hello

53
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:21,703
Good afternoon, Cee Cee,
Niles, Miss Fine, baby.

54
00:04:21,703 --> 00:04:23,385
Why?

55
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:26,353
Some woman just abandoned
this baby on the subway.

56
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,203
I'll tell you it's
a good thing I was there,

57
00:04:28,203 --> 00:04:30,590
or he could have been
found by some whacko.

58
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,025
You know, one of those people who walk
around talking to themselves.

59
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,675
Although, what the hell I'm going
to do with a baby, I'll never know.

60
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,398
I'll call 911.

61
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:44,563
What kind of evil, cold-hearted woman abandons
a poor little defenseless creature?

62
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:49,693
Oh, that reminds me. Yellow cab called,
you left your dog in the taxi again.

63
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,618
Oh, my God.

64
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:54,882
That's where
I left my Gucci umbrella.

65
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:58,606
Ten to one she comes back with
a Gucci and not a poochie.

66
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:01,657
Hello, you've reached emergency 911.

67
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:05,613
To report a murder, press 1,
for mugging, press 2.

68
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:09,080
For bomb threats below
34th Street, press 3;

69
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,406
34th Street to 72nd, press 4.

70
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:15,038
Oh, you gotta love the NYPD.

71
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,398
Meanwhile, where's that David Carruso going
so fast with that big white freckly butt of his?

72
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:23,994
Miss Fine, why the devil did
you bring the baby here?

73
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:26,716
Why didn't you just pass him over
to a policeman straight-away?

74
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:28,847
They're very busy. It's Sunday.

75
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:31,558
The gays are coming out;
the yuppies are working out;

76
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:34,418
and the Jews are eating out.

77
00:05:37,652 --> 00:05:40,253
Be careful. Mr. Snoopy's really old.

78
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:44,161
Look, his tail's loose;
his hair's falling out,
and he's busting at the seams.

79
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,594
Oh, give him a remote control.
He could be my father.

80
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,851
Fran ... / Here, you hold.
What sweetie? What?

81
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,114
Fran, I can't find
my blankie anywhere.

82
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,313
Fran?

83
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:03,418
Yes, honey. / I can't find any bottles
anywhere. How about a turkey baster?

84
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,820
Oh, sweetie. We're trying to feed
a baby, not impregnate Ling-Ling.

85
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:09,357
Oh, all right, Miss Fine that's it.

86
00:06:09,357 --> 00:06:12,038
Here's your coat. We're going down
to the police station.

87
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,090
Oh, all right, but I'm telling you,
we're never going to get through.

88
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,774
How many gay people can
there be in New York?

89
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:21,781
This from a man who
produces Broadway musicals?

90
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:27,141
It's a bloody mob scene out there.

91
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:31,638
I mean, I'm proud I'm British.
But you won't see me marching
around dressed as Queen Victoria.

92
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:35,344
I told you we should have
taken the subway.

93
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,642
Why? Hoping to pick up a few more?

94
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:40,023
Maybe start a bowling team?

95
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,389
Hey, a hundred sexy men
wanted your phone number.

96
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:48,111
All they asked me was
if my boots came in a Size 13.

97
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:52,271
The baby's back.
/ Oh, Daddy, can we keep him?

98
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:55,567
Gracie, he's not a lost puppy.
He's somebody's baby.

99
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:58,681
All right. Can I have a puppy?

100
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:00,652
No, you may not have a puppy.

101
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,678
Well, I don't know.
It might help fill the void

102
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:07,291
after we have to give
away our baby boy.

103
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,353
Miss Fine / We need another
boy in this hen house.

104
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:13,531
There's far too much
"Blossom" on the tube.

105
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:17,143
Here, Maggie, hold
little Joshua Elliott.

106
00:07:17,143 --> 00:07:18,744
Who?

107
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:23,771
Well, Elliott after your father,
and Joshua I just always liked.

108
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,154
Oh, I can't wait to have
a baby of my own.

109
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:29,836
Yes, you can wait.

110
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:33,484
You can wait a lot.

111
00:07:33,484 --> 00:07:36,404
Can you say Nintendo?

112
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,860
Oh, he's so cute.

113
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:43,017
We can't give him up.
/ No.

114
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,607
Euu, he's pooping.
/ Oh, God.

115
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:50,371
Oh, no, give him to Brighten.
/ No, give him to Fran. She's getting paid.

116
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:55,660
Oh, what are they making
such a fuss about?

117
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,530
You'd think that they'd
never ever seen a...

118
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:12,031
Oh ... Oh, this kid's got far
too many lentils in his diet.

119
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,864
Oh, for God's sake,
just give him to me.

120
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:19,021
Come here, little fella. Hoe ...

121
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,379
All right. I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to call the Department of Social Services.

122
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,829
Oh, yeah, Sunday at 4:30,
they're waiting for you.

123
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:37,467
Oh, there's that vein
in your forehead again.

124
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,741
You know, Miss Fine, it's very odd.

125
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,059
But that vein wasn't there a year ago.

126
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,230
Just like the gray
streak in your hair?

127
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,523
Yes, exactly like
the bloody gray streak.

128
00:08:45,523 --> 00:08:49,671
Oh, now, would you calm down.
You're getting all wound up.

129
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,507
Pretty soon you're going to say
something that you're going to regret.

130
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:55,114
I already did when I said,
"You're hired."

131
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:58,674
All right. Fine. I'll just dump
the kid at the white zone at the airport.

132
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:02,565
There'll be 40 cops on top of him
before he's done unloading.

133
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:06,131
Oh, Maxwell, I'm so glad you got
that baby to the authorities.

134
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:10,472
I was very worried about
that poor little defenseless thing.

135
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:16,098
Oh, slap that kid's picture on
a milk carton, and let's get back to work.

136
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:27,774
Oh, Joshy, what's the matter?
Why aren't you eating?

137
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,697
Oh, Niles, what the hell is this?

138
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:33,959
Pureed liver and Brussels sprouts.

139
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:38,876
Oh, the stuff that came out of him
was more appetizing than that.

140
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:44,603
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, now don't get mad.

141
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:48,982
I'm just giving him one last feeding before
I have to take him to the orphanage.

142
00:09:48,982 --> 00:09:52,379
Can you say, "Please, sir,
I want some more."

143
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,646
That's enough, Miss Fine.

144
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:58,945
Well, what's with the box? Are you planning
on mailing him to the police station?

145
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,691
Because then you better punch
some holes in the top.

146
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:04,649
As a matter of fact, these are
some of Brighten's old baby clothes.

147
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,426
I thought they might
come in handy.

148
00:10:06,426 --> 00:10:09,043
Oh, that was very sweet of you.

149
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:14,199
Isn't he a nice man?
Isn't he a good man? Yes.

150
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:20,830
Miss Fine, I think you're becoming far
too emotionally attached to this child.

151
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,436
Yes, isn't she, little fella.

152
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:27,029
She, she is.
I think she is.

153
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:30,380
I think she is.
/ Well, you look very natural.

154
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,597
I've been there
three times, Miss Fine.

155
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:36,905
And if my expertise serves me,
I think we need changing again. Excuse us.

156
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:38,520
Oh, give him to me.
I'll take him.

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,108
No, no, that's all right.
I've got him. I'll do it.

158
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:42,264
All right. Wait a minute here.
/ Let's just lay him down there.

159
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:45,068
Lay him down. / Yeah, little fella.
We're gonna change you.

160
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:49,048
Yeah, good boy, yeah,
good boy, good boy.

161
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,138
Well, Miss Fine,
I wouldn't stay there.

162
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:53,251
You never know with little boys.

163
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:56,362
Brighten once shorted a wall clock.

164
00:10:58,476 --> 00:11:00,471
There we go.
/ Oh, yeah.

165
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:05,922
Well, we know one thing for sure.
His mother was not speaking Hebrew.

166
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:16,152
They love it when you blow
on their tummies. / Who doesn't?

167
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:18,700
Who's the handsome
fella there, huh?

168
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,552
Yes, who's the handsome fella?
You know he reminds me of Brighten.

169
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,972
Heads up.
/ Oh, exactly like Brighten.

170
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:30,562
What did you do?
What did you do?

171
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:34,170
We'll get you dry. Yes, we will.
/ You're a good boy.

172
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,069
You know, Miss Fine, I apologize
for blowing up at you earlier.

173
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:44,237
Well, Mr. Sheffield, I apologize for...
actually, I didn't do anything.

174
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,777
You're quite right.

175
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,136
Come here, little guy. Come here.

176
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:52,293
Oh, oh, honey, would you
I mean, Mr. Sheffield,

177
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:54,150
put the TV on.

178
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,329
They like the background noise.

179
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,730
Senator Doll said
he hasn't read the bill,

180
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,671
but he's 100 percent against it.

181
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,467
And in the local news, police
are looking for this woman

182
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:10,177
in connection with the mid-morning
kidnapping on the subway.

183
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,410
Oh, would you look at that nut.

184
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,462
And she's running around free.

185
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:17,060
Oh, my God, Miss Fine, that's you.

186
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,815
No way.

187
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,993
Suspect is said
to be five foot, seven;

188
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:24,294
approximately 105 pounds,
and in her early 20's.

189
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:27,473
Oh, you're right. It is me.

190
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,272
Miss Fine ...

191
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:31,186
Well, now, it's obviously a mistake.

192
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:34,074
And it's all my problem.
It has nothing to do with you.

193
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:36,513
Suspect is believed
to work for this man,

194
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:39,861
the Broadway producer
Maxwell Sheffield.

195
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:42,068
All right, that's it.
We're going down to the police station.

196
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:47,080
Oh, can't we just call Al Cowlings
and drive around for a while first?

197
00:13:03,497 --> 00:13:07,859
Oh, wow! This looks just like
the police station on Cagney and Lacey.

198
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,099
No wonder they had so much
crime in that precinct.

199
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:14,916
All you had to do was
out run Tyne Daily.

200
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,259
Mr. Sheffield, maybe you should
take a number?

201
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:20,512
Miss Fine, this isn't a bakery.
They don't give you numbers.

202
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:23,052
Oh, all right.
/ 62.

203
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,421
Would you go get
a number, please.

204
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,924
Men, what are you going
to do with them?

205
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,988
Well, I'm not going
to shoot him next time.

206
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,497
Oh, little Jeremy Mathew,
how are you?

207
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:41,309
What happened to Joshua Elliott?

208
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:43,708
I got tired of it.

209
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,746
I like the name Joshua.

210
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:47,517
63.

211
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:50,790
Oh, that's us. Now may
I do the talking, please.

212
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:56,141
Now, Mr. Sheffield. I got us into this,
let me. Now, look, Dick / Sergeant.

213
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:57,566
I'm sorry, Seargeant.

214
00:13:57,566 --> 00:14:00,894
Dick Sergeant,
what are the odds?

215
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,358
Miss Fine ...

216
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:05,805
Oh, all right, you better
talk to him. I'm exhausted.

217
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,899
I've been taking care of
a strange baby all day.

218
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,804
Sergeant, this woman,
my nanny, Fran Fine,

219
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:15,742
is charged with a crime that
I can assure you she didn't commit.

220
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,229
Prostitution?

221
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:19,414
Excuse me.

222
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:21,488
I'm not a hooker.

223
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:24,232
I'm a kidnapper.

224
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:26,050
Well, my lawyer will
finally get that house

225
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,714
in the south of France
he's always wanted.

226
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:31,930
Fran Fine, you're under arrest.

227
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,972
Oh, my God. Mr. Sheffield,
call Jacoby & Meyers.

228
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,266
I want the fat one, not the thin one.
He's got an attitude.

229
00:14:41,266 --> 00:14:44,029
Or is that Siskel and Ebert?

230
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:46,035
You have the right to remain silent.

231
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:49,041
Obviously you don't
know her very well.

232
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:52,715
Shoes

233
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,713
Hair

234
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,327
Well, height is one thing,
but if you think

235
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,746
that I'm going to set
one foot on a scale,

236
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:15,952
you might as well just put me into
a cell and throw away the key.

237
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:19,128
What next? Because frankly
I'm feeling very violated.

238
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:23,294
We're going to have to
strip search you.

239
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:26,726
Oh, no. Not until there's
a ring on this finger

240
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,057
and two tickets to Aruba.

241
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:35,919
Oh ... Well, I wouldn't
want to obstruct justice.

242
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:53,866
Oh, sir
/ Niles, what are you doing here?

243
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:57,970
Well, I was watching "America's
Most Wanted" and low and behold ...

244
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,239
I brought you a fresh shirt and
your shaving things. / Oh, thank you.

245
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,591
I don't plan on being
here very long.

246
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,403
How on earth did you get here
with that gay pride parade going on?

247
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:10,183
Oh, I borrowed a poodle and walked.

248
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:15,987
In fact, I got several job offers.
What's the difference between
a butler and a houseboy?

249
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:19,847
Well, in your case,
about 30 years, Niles.

250
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:22,344
Rot in jail, sir.

251
00:16:26,088 --> 00:16:29,717
Well, there's one
fantasy shot to hell.

252
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:42,852
Niles ...

253
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:47,552
Didn't you see me fall in that
Con Ed ditch? I nearly killed myself.

254
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:52,611
All I saw was a blond woman in
an olive overcoat, and then she was gone.

255
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,397
Well, what am I wearing?

256
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:58,469
Oh, looky there.

257
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:02,504
Maxwell, is everything all right?

258
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:05,719
Has she been incarcerated yet?
Did I miss it?

259
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:08,716
Cee Cee, you could show
some concern for Miss Fine.

260
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:12,469
Maxwell, my concern is for you.

261
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:16,805
Before Nanny Fine entered our lives,
we never had to step foot
in a place like this.

262
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:20,830
Cee Cee? Girlfriend.

263
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,058
Got you again, huh?

264
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:26,785
You must have me confused
with someone else.

265
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:28,828
I've never seen
this person before in my life.

266
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:31,858
Oh, is that your game,
that's cool.

267
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:36,587
Just stay off Second Avenue.
Leon's looking for you.

268
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,384
Maxwell, I swear.

269
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:43,956
Here you go.

270
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:54,600
How'd you like it, sugar? / Oh, it was so good,
I could do it again and again and again.

271
00:17:56,238 --> 00:18:00,622
Maxwell, you can't seriously
believe that... I know.

272
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,190
Did you go to Brinmar?

273
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:09,271
Miss Fine,
what did they do to you?

274
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:11,348
Oh, it was horrible.

275
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:15,067
Seven women, one toilet, no door.

276
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,031
Here's Big Bertha doing her business
right out there in the open

277
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,837
like she's on "Wild Kingdom"
or something.

278
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,716
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I'm scared.
I can't go to prison.

279
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:33,322
I went to the bathroom maybe
three times in all of summer camp.

280
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:36,414
I can't hold it in
for five to twenty.

281
00:18:36,414 --> 00:18:37,999
You're going to have
to come with me.

282
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:41,298
Oh, I can't believe
this is happening.

283
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,642
I was just trying to be helpful.

284
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:47,561
This is just like Nickie
on the "Young and the Restless."

285
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,509
Young and Restless? / Yeah.

286
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:53,241
Nickie Newman. (Inaudible.)
/ Yes, yes,

287
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:57,352
remember Nickie was accused of stealing
Cricket's baby at Gibo Cosmetics.

288
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:59,069
Cricket's ... (Inaudible.)

289
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:02,121
Only she wasn't stealing the baby.

290
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:05,139
She was looking or a woman
that was putting on blush.

291
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:08,923
Mascara. / Oh, yeah,
she's right, she's right.

292
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:13,737
And then Cricket thought that the baby
was stolen and Nickie went to jail,

293
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:18,927
and that shower scene was more
than we should have seen on daytime.

294
00:19:18,927 --> 00:19:21,486
Quiet, quiet.

295
00:19:21,486 --> 00:19:24,486
It wasn't Cricket's baby.

296
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,989
It was Ashley and Snapper's.
/ Snapper.

297
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:33,982
All right.
Considering the circumstances,

298
00:19:33,982 --> 00:19:36,206
I guess you're free to go, Miss Fine.

299
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:40,654
Can I at least say
good-bye to the baby?

300
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:44,050
Just wave, Miss Fine.
/ Oh ... Bye, Joshy.

301
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:49,429
Oh, Cibignia.
/ Cibignia.

302
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,535
Oh, that ought to go over
big on the playgrounds.

303
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,699
Well, I only knew him
for a couple of hours,

304
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:59,998
but I'll never forget him.

305
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,761
I'll never forget her either.
Quick, act like we're together.

306
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:21,926
You know what? I sort of liked
having a baby in the house,

307
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:25,480
except I had no idea
how much work they were.

308
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,534
And they're always making a mess.

309
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:35,368
You know what, Niles,
on second thought,

310
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:38,047
could you bring these upstairs
so we can watch some TV? / Thanks.

311
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:42,792
I have two words for you.
Hansel and Gretel.

312
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,315
Well, actually,
that's three words.

313
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:58,732
Oh, my, would you look
at this mess.

314
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:02,314
I'm binging. I'm a little depressed
about giving back the baby.

315
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:06,502
Oh, well, sweetie, we had to
give him back. He wasn't ours.

316
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:09,069
That's right.
He didn't belong to our family.

317
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:12,190
Then why don't
you two make a baby?

318
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,818
Take it away, Mr. Sheffield.

319
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:19,520
Well, I mean, we'd have to be...
well, you know, you have to be married first.

320
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,601
Oh, right, married.
/ Has to be an engagement.

321
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:24,669
I'd want a big ring,
a party... don't ask.

322
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:28,284
Then why don't you two get married?

323
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:31,479
I did the last one.
/ Thanks.

324
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:34,899
Well, you have to be in love
with the person.

325
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:38,631
Don't you love, Fran?
/ Yeah. Don't you love Fran?

326
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,933
Well, in a nanny-Fran-boss
type of way.

327
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:48,275
Yeah. And I love your father in
a thanks-a-lot-you-British-cold-fish type of way.

328
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:53,121
But you could have a baby and
get married if you wanted to.

329
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,861
Well, we'd have to be best friends
to see if we can live together,

330
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:02,332
and of course there'd have to be
a very strong physical attraction...

331
00:22:02,332 --> 00:22:05,142
would you go to bed. Geez.

332
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:11,364
Kids, huh? Always asking questions.
/ And such vivid imaginations.

333
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:14,893
Why is the sky blue?
Where's heaven?

334
00:22:14,893 --> 00:22:18,833
Why don't you and I have a baby?
/ Ha, ha, ha, ha.

335
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,236
Meanwhile, I wonder
if I'll ever be a mother.

336
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:24,239
Well, there's always
the subway, Miss Fine.

337
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:26,171
Forget it. Next time
I bring home a baby,

338
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:29,008
it's going to be after nine months
of swollen ankles and an epidural

339
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:32,724
that could bring down Secretariat.

340
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,245
Please, no putting on makeup.

341
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:59,976
What are you going to do?
Charge me with lipstick?

342
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:04,352
Let's not play games.
Did you take the baby, Fran?

343
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:08,371
Now, I'd have to be pretty
stupid to take a baby

344
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:11,950
when I could have
taken the salami,

345
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,720
and I'm not stupid ...

346
00:23:20,254 --> 00:23:23,995
Can I get a little eye contact here?

347
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:29,732
Oh ... You got a better chance of seeing
Tania Harding on a box of Wheaties.
