1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,083
So, Gracie, are you excited about
your play date with Willie?

2
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:09,018
I think Willie just wants
me for my toys.

3
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:12,144
Oh, sweetie, you might
as well get used to it.

4
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:16,085
You're going to be guarding your
toys for the rest of your life.

5
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:19,802
Well, we're off. First game
of the Broadway Show League.

6
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:24,832
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, don't
you look adorable.

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,568
You know, I don't think I've
ever seen you in jeans before.

8
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:29,810
Wait a minute. Turn around.
I think you got a rip.

9
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,787
No, no. Looking good.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,451
Let's get going, Dad. I want
to warm up before we play.

11
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,614
Oh, what's your rush.
I've been to those games.

12
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:44,490
Whose idea was it to have Nell
Carter try and beat out a bunt?

13
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:47,880
Fran, we're playing against
"Children of a Lesser God."

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,365
Their hand signals are awesome.

15
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:53,124
So's the guy on first base. / Ohhhhh.

16
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:56,447
Oh, give it up, Maggie.
They're deaf, not blind.

17
00:00:56,854 --> 00:01:00,409
Here. What's this hand
signal mean? / Ouch!

18
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:03,842
Well, Brighten's playing sports,
and I accept tips.

19
00:01:03,842 --> 00:01:08,271
Please, the only reason he's on the team
is a chance to see Margaret trying to run.

20
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:12,767
Oh, now, don't you go making fun.
I've seen you break into a trot.

21
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:16,229
You got a little "Nutty Professor"
thing happening yourself

22
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,146
Yeah, well, all right.
Time to play ball. Bye, sweetheart.

23
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:22,872
Have fun. Oh, you're talking to Grace.

24
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,370
Master Willie is here with his nanny.

25
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:30,644
Oh, now, honey, you go make an entrance
and check yourself like I taught you.

26
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:33,104
I'm fine.

27
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:37,832
Miss Fine, you might want to
dressed for this particular nanny.

28
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:40,658
Oh, why? What?
Is she all snazzed up?

29
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:46,223
One of those Park Avenue nannies with
way too much time on her hands?

30
00:01:46,223 --> 00:01:50,597
Oh, look, "Planet of the Apes"
is on at 4:00.

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,118
Hi, I'm Kurt, Willie's nanny.

32
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,534
Oh, hi, I'm Fran. How you doing?
/ Good. Okay if I use the phone?

33
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,470
Oh, yeah. Sure. Just pick up Line 2.

34
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,977
I'm on Line 1 with my mother.

35
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:04,024
Uh-huh ...

36
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,972
What are you doing?

37
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:10,532
Oh, I thought there might be
something wrong with your eyes.

38
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:12,201
A handsome man just
walked through the door

39
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:17,022
and you didn't do your usual
subtle Hanna-Barbara reaction —

40
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,610
heart pounding through your thorax,

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,292
tongue unfurrowing and
landing on the floor.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,718
Well, first of all, I was
instantly attracted to him,

43
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:37,815
which means he's
definitely unavailable.

44
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:40,120
Plus, did you see that
upper body? Trust me.

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,397
He's either gay or a priest
with a solar plexus.

46
00:02:44,904 --> 00:02:47,787
Miss Fine, you're mad.
/ Oh, yeah? All right.

47
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:50,525
Well, watch this,
Mr. Know-It-All.

48
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:55,097
Kurt, who understudied
Carol Channing in "Dolly"?

49
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:58,972
Joanne Worley. / Hello ...

50
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,571
I can never get Willie to take
a nap. You're amazing.

51
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:54,577
I'm telling you,
turkey makes you tired.

52
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:57,660
Why do you think they serve
it at Thanksgiving?

53
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,539
How else can you spend
eight hours with your entire family

54
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:03,939
unless half of them pass out?

55
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:08,721
Oh, what I wouldn't give for
Jimmy Smith's body. / Hey, you and me both.

56
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:13,573
Meanwhile, I watch and watch, the only
one taking a shower is Dennis Franz.

57
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:17,135
Do you believe David Carruso
left that show? / Oh, actors, huh?

58
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:21,276
I'm an actor.
/ Smart, very smart.

59
00:04:21,276 --> 00:04:23,971
Is it okay if I use the phone again?
My agent asked me to call him.

60
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:28,182
Oh, absolutely. Maybe you got a job?
/ No. He's just a sadist.

61
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:32,460
But, then, I'm addicted to rejection,
so we both get a kick.

62
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:37,739
Oh look who's home.
How'd the game go?

63
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:40,200
That depends
if you're on our team or theirs.

64
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Maxwell, it wasn't my fault.
I couldn't understand your signals.

65
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,337
Cee Cee, how many things
can this mean? Run!

66
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:54,100
Next time try yelling "last call."

67
00:04:54,695 --> 00:05:00,617
Oh, Niles, dear-sweet-I-manage-
your-pension-plan- Niles ...

68
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:03,782
May I get you some tea?

69
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:07,343
You know, I don't mind that we lost.
I mean, at least I made it to first base.

70
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:11,985
You never even made it out of the dugout.
/ I know.

71
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:16,326
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, Mr. Sheffield, wait a minute.
I think you got some grass stains there.

72
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:19,572
No, no. Looking good.

73
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,501
Oh, Mr. Sheffield ... Kurt Jacobs.

74
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,842
I was the understudy in
your production of "Equist."

75
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:32,597
Oh, Kurt, yes, of course. I didn't
recognize you without the big horse head.

76
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:38,297
Hello, Kurt. Remember me?
Cee Cee Babcock?

77
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,437
No.

78
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:44,549
I'm the producer who hired you?
/ Oh, right, right, right.

79
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:47,634
You, ah, you cut your hair.
Hey, it looks really fabulous —

80
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:49,564
Knock it off, Kurt.

81
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,879
So, how are you? Are you working?

82
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,573
Yes. I'm a nanny.
/ Oh, how awful for you.

83
00:05:56,897 --> 00:06:02,996
Ohhh ... Oh, for a minute there,
I almost took that the wrong way.

84
00:06:05,876 --> 00:06:08,016
So, Kurt, you're a nanny, huh?

85
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:11,529
Well, that's wonderful. You know,
children are our greatest resource.

86
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:16,483
Daddy ... / Not now, Margaret.
I'm talking to our guest.

87
00:06:18,326 --> 00:06:21,047
Well, it's been nice talking to you.
/ Okay.

88
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,627
So, come on, you want to watch
a little of "All My Children"?

89
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:27,248
Gee, I hope it was okay to tape
it over this movie tape,

90
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:30,850
"Brighten learns to walk."

91
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,831
Isn't that funny? I never even heard that
name Brighten until I started working — Ohhhhh.

92
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,374
Hey, look who's up. Wow, you guys
really nodded off.

93
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:48,934
Can we go see the "Lion King" again?
/ Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.

94
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:52,322
You're a little late. The two of you
slept right through the last show.

95
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:56,419
Besides, I got akunas
coming out of my matatas.

96
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:02,731
Is it only playing in one theater?
/ Yes. All the parents got together and insisted.

97
00:07:04,496 --> 00:07:08,028
Well, come on, don't go anywhere.
We're going to watch "All My Children."

98
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,842
Listen, I haven't seen this soap
in seven months. Catch me up.

99
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:14,210
Well, they're still at Erica's party,

100
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:18,344
and the new guy slept with
what's her face's sister.

101
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:22,402
P.S., she's late,
which means she's pregnant.

102
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,455
Did you hear what they said?
/ What?

103
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:32,430
I was late to the "Lion King"
because we slept together. / So?

104
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,228
So, P.S., I'm pregnant.

105
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:40,116
I'd better get a job.

106
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,009
Miss Fine not back yet?
/ Oh, no, sir.

107
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,052
She and Kurt went to the movies and then
for cappuccinos in Greenwich Village.

108
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:54,277
Do you think they might have
gotten lost? / Oh, no, sir.

109
00:07:54,277 --> 00:07:58,718
I think Kurt knows his way around
cappuccino country.

110
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:04,301
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Oh, Kurt, stop it.
I can't laugh anymore.

111
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:09,023
Oh, he does Merril Streep in
"Out of Africa" is to die for.

112
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:14,982
Do it. "I had a farm in Africa ..."
Well, he does it better.

113
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:18,725
Fran, I think Mr. Sheffield has
already seen me overact.

114
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:23,442
Well, I guess I could do it for
you if you want ... but I won't.

115
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:27,053
Meet you upstairs, Fran.
/ Okay. I'll be up in a few minutes.

116
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:29,726
Kurt's going to help me decide
what clothes to return.

117
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:34,620
Visa raised my limit.
Well, I showed them.

118
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:37,377
I hope you don't mind.
I know your rule about men in my room.

119
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:39,753
Oh, well, Miss Fine, it's a little
different with Kurt.

120
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:44,762
He's more like your friend Val,
only with a five o'clock shadow.

121
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:47,851
You've never seen Val at 5:00.

122
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:53,164
Oh, I'll tell you, it is just
so easy being with Kurt.

123
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:57,360
I mean, I don't have to act like
I give a damn about the Super Bowl,

124
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,656
and wherever we go, we go dutch treat.
Although that part I could live without.

125
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:09,553
But on the upside, I can eat a side of
beef in front of him and belch up a hoof.

126
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:15,603
Want to hand me a plate?
/ Oh, yeah.

127
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:18,280
Well, I think you two are ideally suited.

128
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,042
You're both charming, outgoing people,
terrifically preoccupied with your appearance.

129
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:27,491
Oh, I know, I know. We both just
get right down to what's important.

130
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:31,588
I'll tell you, if he was straight,
I'd bring him home to my mother.

131
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:35,866
Well, that's something I'm sure
he can be grateful for.

132
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:39,127
Oh, I'll tell you, it's just
the story of my life.

133
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:42,424
I mean, we could have such
a beautiful future together.

134
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:46,950
We both want the same things.
Except one.

135
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:51,357
No — actually, we both
want that thing, too.

136
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:57,890
Well, I know this one's going back.

137
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,872
Wait a second. Didn't
you wear that yesterday?

138
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:02,975
Yeah, but I didn't break a sweat.

139
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:08,973
So tell me, is your mother
a natural blond, too?

140
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:11,977
Ah, yeah.

141
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:16,959
Fran, look at this. I gotta shave again.
I'm telling you something, you women have it easy.

142
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,667
Oh, honey, talk to me when
you got a tongue depressor

143
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:26,013
full of hot bees' wax coming
at your bikini line. Dah-dah.

144
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,912
Oh, now this is fabulous.
/ Yeah? Zip me up.

145
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:34,191
Lots of easy access, too. / Oh, good.
And I wasn't sure if the message would get across.

146
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:37,182
This shows off all my most sensitive areas.

147
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:41,059
Here, here, here, here —

148
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:45,089
well, almost all my most sensitive areas.

149
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:49,982
Hey, remember those puzzles where you
had to connect the dots? / Yeah, yeah.

150
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,695
Oh, stop it, Kurt. I'm very ticklish.

151
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:58,739
Sort of like those college boards
where you had to fill in the dots.

152
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:06,368
Kurt ...
/ Uh-huh.

153
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:10,918
What's charmeuse?
/ I have no idea.

154
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:15,370
Oh, my God. You're not gay?

155
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:26,137
You're straight? Oh, I can't believe this.

156
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:30,966
Oh, this was really bad.
It's too slutty even for me.

157
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:35,096
When did you find out you were straight?

158
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:38,308
And does your mother know?

159
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,813
What'd she do? Dress you
in boys' clothes?

160
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:48,525
Fran, come out of the closet.
/ No. You go back into the closet.

161
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:53,406
I cannot believe I told you what
I do for yeast infections.

162
00:11:53,406 --> 00:11:56,794
I poured Correctol in front of you.

163
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:58,227
Ahhhh!

164
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:01,655
You saw me without makeup on.

165
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:06,449
Fran, look, if you liked me when
you thought I was gay — / Huh?

166
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,544
— you're going to love me now.

167
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:10,619
Come on, Fran. / Huh?

168
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:13,839
Don't you feel the same way I do?

169
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,020
What did I —

170
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,133
Miss Fine!
/ Oh, Mr. Sheffield!

171
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:23,231
I'm really sorry, Mr. Sheffield.
Boy, this is incredibly embarrassing.

172
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:26,350
Look, Kurt, you have absolutely
nothing to feel embarrassed about.

173
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,589
Miss Fine, will you leave this
poor man alone. / Not.

174
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:34,072
I'm so sorry about this, Kurt.
Oh, you must be feeling terrible.

175
00:12:34,072 --> 00:12:37,732
Oh, my God, she's got lipstick
all over you ...

176
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:40,956
He might have a significant other.
Did you ever stop to think of that?

177
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:46,432
Kurt, you better go. Mr. Sheffield's
going to hurt himself jumping to conclusions.

178
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,046
I'll call you tomorrow, Fran.
/ Okay.

179
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,798
What was that? What — whatwas
that thing that just happened there?

180
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:57,645
Well, I got a news flash for you.

181
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:02,218
Kurt is a flaming heterosexual.

182
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:06,935
Not a bad little kisser either.
All right. While you're here,

183
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:09,643
tell me, should I take this back?

184
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:11,647
Ah, I think you should put it on.

185
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,808
No. I already had it on.
It flattens out my —

186
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:17,996
Oh! Mr. Sheffield,
why didn't you say anything?

187
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,992
Well, I — I didn't notice.

188
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:23,929
You didn't — you know, I'm beginning
to wonder about you too.

189
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:28,757
Oh ... Oh, I can't get it on.
I'm stuck. Help me, help me.

190
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:33,645
Relax, Miss Fine, we'll get on.
/ Don't rip it.

191
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:39,405
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I'm so hot.
/ I can't do this standing up.

192
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:43,223
Just — just get on the bed.

193
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,702
If you let me tell Miss Babcock
about this, I'll work free for a year.

194
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:08,963
I brought you some pickles
and ice cream.

195
00:14:10,044 --> 00:14:14,066
I'm so nauseous and
my ankles are swollen.

196
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:17,898
I hate you. You did this to me.

197
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,960
I know. I just wish I knew how.

198
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:28,091
I'm just so worried. Are we doing the right
thing bringing a child into this world?

199
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:31,816
Boy, could those kids play house or what?

200
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:36,678
Ah-ha, just as I thought.

201
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:39,520
Kurt's teeth are capped.

202
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,618
What?
/ No, no, I'm not making it up.

203
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:46,508
Look, look, you can see the little ridges.
See. Huh? Huh? Huh?

204
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,916
Maxwell, what is wrong with you today?

205
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,675
If you're not going to pay
any attention to me,

206
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:54,920
I might as well just go home.

207
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:58,748
Taxi!

208
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:05,309
I have three words for you —

209
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:08,362
Orange County bonds.

210
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,293
Mr. Sheffield, I got a couple of
things to talk to you about.

211
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:17,077
No. 1, do not use the downstairs bathroom.

212
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:20,383
No. 2? / Exactly.

213
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:26,052
Thank you, Miss Fine. You know,
I've just been going through Kurt's resume.

214
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:29,131
Oh, are you thinking of giving
him a job? / Well, yes.

215
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:31,761
Let's see what he's suited for, huh?
/ Okay.

216
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:35,746
Man in crowd, man at stadium,
man in parade ...

217
00:15:35,746 --> 00:15:37,860
Well, he was in "Forrest Gump."

218
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,344
Oh, yes. There he is. Man at rally.

219
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:42,967
That was him?

220
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,179
Well, aren't you a laugh riot.
What? Have you got

221
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,444
in Buddy and Sally under the desk?

222
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:52,392
Meanwhile, your son wants to
talk to you. Go ahead, honey.

223
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:55,862
Ah, Dad, I know you want to get me
into sports and everything,

224
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:58,388
but why do you always do shows
with old ladies?

225
00:15:58,388 --> 00:16:00,369
Well, excuse me,

226
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:04,711
but most people would be honored to be
on a team with Katherine Hepburn.

227
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:08,401
Well, yeah, but did you have
to make her catcher?

228
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,751
Put it there. Put it there.

229
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,322
I mean, how do you pitch to that?

230
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:21,479
Well, I guess I'm going to go upstairs
and get ready for my date with Kurt.

231
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:29,286
Nanny Fine trying to pass off Kurt
as a date. How pathetic.

232
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,853
This from a woman who went to Cancun
with a crash dummy.

233
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:40,111
Oh, haven't you heard, Cee Cee?
It appears our Kurt is straight.

234
00:16:40,111 --> 00:16:43,074
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Oh, that's impossible.

235
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:48,219
We worked together for several months.
There was actually no sexual tension.

236
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,491
Well, dah ...

237
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:05,885
Well, I couldn't be happier that
Nanny Fine finally found a man.

238
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:11,797
And what are you looking so smug about?
/ Oh, just an incident in Miss Fine's room last night.

239
00:17:12,026 --> 00:17:15,476
With her and Kurt?
/ No. With her and another man.

240
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:19,040
Oh, I love it. Tell me, tell me.
/ Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.

241
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,175
I swore I wouldn't say a word.
Read this.

242
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:29,722
Why?

243
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:31,945
I want to die.

244
00:17:31,945 --> 00:17:34,017
There, there ...

245
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:37,590
Now don't do anything rash.

246
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:47,688
Good night, Cee Cee.
/ You animal.

247
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:51,255
Niles?
/ Sir?

248
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,819
You didn't say anything to Miss Babcock
about last night, did you?

249
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:58,160
No. You told me not to. / Good.

250
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,810
Niles, do you — do you think I've been
a little too rough on Miss Fine?

251
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:05,853
Well, she seemed to enjoy it, sir.

252
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,767
I'm not talking about last night.

253
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,096
Oh, Niles, I don't know.
It's this thing with her and Kurt.

254
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:14,691
Why is it gnawing at me like this?

255
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:18,088
Well, perhaps you feel that
he's not the right man for her,

256
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,748
that she'd be happier with someone else.

257
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,765
That's absurd. They're perfectly
suited to each other.

258
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:27,929
So why do I find it
so bloody irritating?

259
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,449
Oh, dear, that was the last apple.

260
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:32,891
Oh, I'm sorry, old man. Did you want it?

261
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,728
Well, yes, sir. But I didn't
realize I wanted it

262
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:40,761
until someone else had sunk his teeth
into it, and now it's too late.

263
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:44,525
Oh, God, it was right there
in front of me.

264
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:50,465
If only I'd snatched it up when I had the chance,
I wouldn't have this aching hunger.

265
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,447
Oh, God, man, have a bloody pear.

266
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,847
Hi, Niles.
/ Miss Fine ...

267
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,190
Going out with Kurt?
/ Oh, I guess so.

268
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,861
Well, you don't seem very excited.
/ Oh, I know, I should be nuts about the guy.

269
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:11,928
I mean, he knows everything about me,
and he's still interested.

270
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:15,957
I don't know. Maybe that's it.
There's no mystery.

271
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:19,743
It's like when you watch "Columbo."
Ten minutes into it, you know who did it.

272
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:25,766
Then you spend the rest of the hour
trying to figure out which one is the glass eye.

273
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:35,541
Oh, Niles, what's wrong with me?

274
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:40,149
Oh, dear, that was the last pear.

275
00:19:41,102 --> 00:19:42,767
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want it?

276
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,921
Well, yes, but I didn't realize I wanted
it until someone else had sunk his teeth into it.

277
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:50,337
Well, you snooze, you lose.

278
00:19:57,533 --> 00:20:00,460
Hey, kids, what are you two
still doing up?

279
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,053
Niles was supposed to put you
to bed an hour ago.

280
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:09,834
Niles ...
/ Huh? Oh, this is not my fault.

281
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,199
Yeah.
/ They gave me turkey.

282
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,712
Good night.
/ Good night.

283
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:17,449
Nine minus seven?
/ Ah, two.

284
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:21,668
Come on, what are you doing?
/ I'm timing her subtractions ...

285
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:28,324
Three seconds.
/ It's time.

286
00:20:28,324 --> 00:20:33,990
Oh, no. We can't have the baby now.
I don't know how to get to the hospital.

287
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,231
Hold it, honey, honey.
Calm down.

288
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:42,462
Gracie, you're not really
having a baby, honey.

289
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,805
But you said when two people sleep
together and the girl is late —

290
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:51,171
well, I was late for the "Lion King."
/ Oy ... That's what you were listening to?

291
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:55,951
Don't put peas up your nose
I have to say nine times.

292
00:20:56,283 --> 00:20:59,677
Sweetie, you are definitely not pregnant.

293
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:03,306
And if you were, we would call
in "Geraldo" immediately.

294
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:05,774
I'm not? / No.

295
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:10,172
Thank God. I'd like to get
a figure before I lose it.

296
00:21:10,624 --> 00:21:15,501
Come on, you two, it's time for bed.
Boy, you two are just so cute.

297
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:19,202
You go upstairs and have sweet dreams.

298
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:23,651
Ah, Willie, you sleep
in Brighten's room.

299
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:26,283
Oh, Miss Fine, good, you're home.
/ Hi.

300
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:31,620
I — I wanted to apologize for the way
I behaved about you and Kurt.

301
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,650
Oh, well, you know,
if I didn't know any better,

302
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:42,577
I would think that you were jealous.
/ Oh, please, Miss — Miss Fine.

303
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:47,425
No. I — I was just concerned about the children.
I thought maybe they'd get attached to Kurt,

304
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:50,206
and, then, when you break up,
they'd be upset.

305
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:53,061
Well, why are you so quick
to say when we break up?

306
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,657
How come you assume my relationships
won't work out?

307
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:59,053
Well, how's it going?
/ It didn't work out.

308
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:05,233
Oh. Did you part amicably?
/ No, not at all. It was very friendly.

309
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:09,879
Well, don't worry, Miss Fine.
If it isn't Kurt, it will be someone else. / Hum ...

310
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:14,020
Good night, Miss Fine. / Good night,
Mr. Sheffield. You know, I'm not asking for much really.

311
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,349
I just want someone that's going
in the same direction as me.

312
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:20,077
I know exactly what you mean.

313
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,540
Oh, Miss Fine ...
/ What?

314
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,352
I think you sat in something.

315
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,132
Nope, looking good.

316
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,932
