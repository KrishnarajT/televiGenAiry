1
00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:07,115
You know, the further back I go into
this family tree thing, the creepier it gets.

2
00:00:07,115 --> 00:00:10,790
Did you know that Great Uncle Phillip
beheaded Great Aunt Isabell?

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,952
You know, the same thing happened
in my family, too.

4
00:00:13,952 --> 00:00:16,946
It was a bad combination
of car sickness

5
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:21,106
and an electric sunroof.

6
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:26,318
Cousin Rupert, the first, married
his sister. / Oh, now, that's creepy.

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,683
That was never proven.
It was just a rumor.

8
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:32,344
Meanwhile, I'm sure their kids
played one hell of a banjo.

9
00:00:32,344 --> 00:00:35,741
Good morning. / Oh, honey,
tell your father the good news.

10
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:38,295
Oh, yeah. There's four
great movies at the Cineplex.

11
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:42,004
No, honey. The other news.

12
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:45,541
We paid for one and snuck in free.

13
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:51,402
Sweetie, sweetie, tell your father
who's coming over after school.

14
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,231
Oh, yeah. I've got a new friend.

15
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:56,579
And does this friend exist
outside of your mind?

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,063
Brighten! Does she, sweetheart?

17
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,286
Of course she does.

18
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:06,843
Gracie has grown and matured since
I've been imparting my wisdom on her.

19
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:10,730
Honey, don't wipe your nose with
your hand. Use your sleeve.

20
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:14,354
Mr. Sheffield, the doctor called to
confirm your 3:30 appointment.

21
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:15,480
Thank you. / And?

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,499
Happily married, not Jewish,
wears Bergenstans.

23
00:01:20,094 --> 00:01:22,195
Why are you going to the doctor?
Is everything okay?

24
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:25,145
Just getting a physical
and a stress test.

25
00:01:25,145 --> 00:01:29,413
Meanwhile, I've got a cousin —
/ Oh, God, she's got a cousin.

26
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:32,328
Shall I push your appointment
back an hour, sir?

27
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:35,470
All I'm saying is that you can
never be too careful.

28
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,330
My Cousin Reed, 35,
worked out every day

29
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,434
— no salt, no sugar — walks out of
a health food store — bam! Dead.

30
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:47,835
Heart attack? / No. He gets hit by
a wheatgerm truck, you know.

31
00:01:48,072 --> 00:01:52,257
And the moral of this story is?
/ Everything has to have a moral?

32
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:55,327
What am I? Mother goose?

33
00:02:44,107 --> 00:02:47,286
I know something you don't know.

34
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:52,071
I'm not the least bit interested, Niles.

35
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:57,248
Nanny Fine is in the will.
/ What? How do you know?

36
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:00,319
Cleaning the extension phone.

37
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,802
Would you stop singing.

38
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:06,421
Am I in it? / Fraid not.

39
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:11,771
Oh, that golddigger.

40
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:14,211
Well, she'll end up with nothing.
I'll contest it.

41
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:16,417
What's he leaving her?
/ The children.

42
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,579
Oh, where's Mr. Sheffield?
He wanted to see me. Oh.

43
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,943
All right. Listen up.
I have pulled a major coup.

44
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:38,819
Oh, well, that will heal itself.

45
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,269
But for the next couple of days, sleep on
your side and wear boxer shorts.

46
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:52,562
I'll file that in the appropriate place.
Thank you, Miss Fine.

47
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:54,645
Anyway, back to what I was
actually talking about.

48
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:57,165
Doug Emerson is coming
to dinner tonight.

49
00:03:57,165 --> 00:04:01,724
Oh, well, that was one schlepp down the
stairs I could have lived without.

50
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:05,645
Doug Emerson? I thought he would
never leave Andrew Lloyd Webber.

51
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:10,286
I didn't know they were together.
Maybe the schlepp was worth it.

52
00:04:10,286 --> 00:04:13,202
Nanny Fine, Doug Emerson is
an investor,

53
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:19,570
and if you have nothing intelligent to —
listen to me, if. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

54
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:23,873
Ohhhhh, well, if Doug's coming tonight,
I better go change.

55
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:28,556
And I thought she had to wait for
a full moon. / Ahhhh ... haaaa ...

56
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:33,397
So, Mr. Sheffield, you wanted to
talk to me about something?

57
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:37,992
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, I have
an important proposal to make.

58
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,803
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, a proposal?

59
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,358
Oh, boy, I'll never doubt
that Jean Dixon again.

60
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,115
What do I do first? Call my mother —

61
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:53,802
no, call the electrolysis.

62
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,123
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, this is very
difficult for me to say.

63
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:02,047
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you're really
throwing me through a loop here.

64
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:06,195
I mean, we're not even on
a first name basis.

65
00:05:06,195 --> 00:05:08,217
Since you've been so wonderful
with the children,

66
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:11,501
I'd like to put it in the will that
you continue as their nanny

67
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:16,082
just in case something happens
to me. / Ohhhhh ...

68
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:24,558
Well, Mr. Sheffield,
I'm really moved to tears.

69
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:29,208
But I don't want to talk
about wills. Toi-toi.

70
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:33,352
I could give that Jean Dixon
such a slap interest.

71
00:05:37,623 --> 00:05:42,529
Honey, you're involved in
a dysfunctional relationship.

72
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:46,393
I know the kind. All his friends are
more important to him than you are.

73
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:50,415
He's selfish. You should
just dump him.

74
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:55,837
She can't. He's got all of
her stickers. / Oh ...

75
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,559
I'm home.
/ Oh, "B" wait a second.

76
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,209
Come here and say hello to
your sister's friend Erica.

77
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,638
Hi, I'm Brighten.

78
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:12,987
Okay. So, um, I'm going
to go get a soda now.

79
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:16,524
Me too. He's a God.

80
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:22,395
Erica likes Brighten?
She really is on the rebound.

81
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:26,373
Oh, honey, to you he's an obnoxious brother,
but to other little girls,

82
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:30,702
he's 79 pounds of pure studmuffin.

83
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,615
Euuuuu ...

84
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,381
Next thing you know,
she'll let him play with her pogs.

85
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:40,213
Well, look, if she's that fast
and loose with her pogs,

86
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,236
she's going to get a reputation.

87
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:48,091
Niles, pour me some more tea.

88
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:56,867
I want some more tea, Niles.

89
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,711
You are a butler, now buttle.

90
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,335
Would you like some tea, Miss Babcock?

91
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:12,421
You know damn well I want some more tea,
you imbecile. Now pour.

92
00:07:12,421 --> 00:07:15,570
Cee Cee!
/ Maxwell?

93
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:19,807
Don't speak to Niles like that.
The poor man isn't a mind reader.

94
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,022
But Maxwell ...
/ Oh, it's all right, sir.

95
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:28,810
Perhaps my hearing isn't what
it once was. Forgive me.

96
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:34,846
So, Niles, about dinner tonight —
/ Oh, I've outdone myself for your new investor, sir.

97
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:38,780
Gorgenzola salad, stuffed pork shops,
potatoes au gratin.

98
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,573
No. No. No. It seems Mr. Emerson
is recovering from a bypass.

99
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:45,772
His doctor FAXed over his American
Heart Association Diet.

100
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:48,962
It's got to be followed to
the letter, I'm afraid.

101
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:51,686
Oh, something smells good.
What is it?

102
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:56,732
Oh, nothing, just a chocolate souffle that's
been rising. Don't need that.

103
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:01,533
Niles, come help me pick out a tie,
would you, old man? / Yes, sir.

104
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:05,604
I've got 15 minutes. Why don't
I just knit you a new suit?

105
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:12,148
I think it's sweet. He wants to make sure you'll
still be his nanny even after he croaks.

106
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:14,801
Val, toi-toi.

107
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,830
He just wants to draw up some papers,
make everything legal.

108
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,517
Why? What's he afraid of.
/ Oh, I don't know,

109
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:24,705
something about his relatives
contesting the will,

110
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:29,445
saying that he was insane
at the time that he hired me.

111
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:32,069
What's this? / What's what?

112
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:35,778
It says "American Heart Association
Coronary Care menu."

113
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:38,299
What? Give me that.

114
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,990
Oh, my God. Val ...

115
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,176
First, the doctor, then the will?
Now this.

116
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:48,234
What are you getting at?
/ Why didn't he say something?

117
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:53,808
What? What?
/ Val, I'm going to be a widow.

118
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:57,322
Honey, you're jumping to conclusions.

119
00:08:57,322 --> 00:09:00,446
Oh, oh, Niles, Niles, do you
know anything about this?

120
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:05,856
Yes. And if I don't follow it to the letter,
Mr. Sheffield's going to have a coronary.

121
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:12,679
Fran, I'm so upset.
/ Oh, honey, I know. Be brave.

122
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,879
Look at the size of this zit.
/ Zit?

123
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,504
Do you have any cover-up in your purse?
/ Oh, sure, honey.

124
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:21,395
I've got — I'll do —
I'll fix —

125
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:26,540
Nothing's going to harm you,
not while I'm around.

126
00:09:34,289 --> 00:09:40,189
Oh, honey, what are you doing here
all by yourself? Where'd Erica go?

127
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,463
I don't know. But Brighten's
in the bathroom.

128
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:45,505
She probably followed him in there.

129
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:49,719
Oh, sweetie, now don't exaggerate.

130
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,132
Get out!

131
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,965
It's not fair. She's supposed
to be my friend.

132
00:09:56,965 --> 00:10:02,526
Honey, an adorable brother could be
a ticket to popularity.

133
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:06,279
Look at Shirley MacLane
and Warren Beatty.

134
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,561
Do you think that if he wasn't her brother
she would have a date in any life?

135
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:15,988
Come on, have I ever steered you wrong?
/ What about that home perm?

136
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:21,523
Meanwhile, you were quick to grab the prize
at the Howie Mandel look-alike contest.

137
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,142
Erica, get away from that door.
Brighten's going to be in there a while.

138
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:28,991
The brassiere section from my Penney's
catalogue is missing.

139
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,739
Hey, Erica, you want to go upstairs?
I'll let you use Brighten's tooth brush. / Cool.

140
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,565
Can you believe she followed
me into the bathroom?

141
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:40,752
Meanwhile, did you put
the seat down because

142
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:44,256
Miss Babcock fell in again.

143
00:10:44,256 --> 00:10:48,027
It wasn't me. I don't know
who keeps leaving it up.

144
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:54,027
Brighten, you're not taking advantage
of this situation.

145
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:59,903
You've got a girl who worships and adores you.
Honey, you gotta do the right thing.

146
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:02,262
What? / Make her your slave.

147
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,323
Cool.

148
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:06,781
Niles, there's a messenger coming
to pick this up in a few minutes.

149
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,733
No! Are you insane? / It's all right.
I've got it.

150
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:13,496
Let go. / No, I've got it.
/ Let go. / All right. Ohhhhhh ...

151
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:20,255
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

152
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:24,078
Well, Miss Fine, while I'm waiting
for the throbbing to subside,

153
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,167
have you given any further thought to
that little matter we discussed?

154
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:31,406
Is it that urgent?
/ Well, I'd certainly rest easier.

155
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:35,750
Oh, look, he's stopping to smell the roses.

156
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:46,467
Oh, Val, thanks for coming back.
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

157
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:51,503
Please, how hard is it to wait for two trains,
a bus, and cut through Central Park at night?

158
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:57,773
Oh, cause you know I'm just so beside myself with
this whole Mr. Sheffield dropping dead situation.

159
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:01,258
Tea? / Sure?

160
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:06,140
I mean, why is he even having this dinner
party? He's in such denial.

161
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,360
And, you know, they're going to ship me and
the kids off to his sister's in England.

162
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,101
England? With all that rain? What are you
going to do there? You know you friz.

163
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:20,960
Oh, my God.
Now you know how upset I am.

164
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,325
I didn't even think about my hair.

165
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:30,299
What am I going to do in England? I'm gonna
have to learn a whole 'nother language.

166
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:35,447
Besides, the truth be told, the kids
are much closer to my side, than his.

167
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:40,425
They may look British,
but they think yes, Yiddish.

168
00:12:40,425 --> 00:12:43,553
Have you thought about
the funeral arrangements?

169
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:46,519
Oh, I forgot about that.

170
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,388
Now I'm going to have
to figure out flowers, food ...

171
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:53,363
how he wants to spend the hereafter?

172
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:58,486
You know, we put Uncle Louie
in a gorgeous urn.

173
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:03,446
Maybe we should stick him in that?
/ Where'd Uncle Louie go?

174
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:06,152
Oh, my mother took a couple of Dexatrim one day

175
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,961
and got on to a real cleaning jag.

176
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:14,979
P.S., Uncle Louie's spending
eternity in a Dirt Devil.

177
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:22,080
Well, if you need a place for the funeral,
my Cousin Gino just redid his parlor.

178
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,152
He bought out the Chinese restaurant next door.

179
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:31,434
I don't know, Val. A funeral
in a Chinese restaurant?

180
00:13:31,434 --> 00:13:35,268
What happens? You cry your eyes out, and
an hour later you want to grieve again.

181
00:13:35,268 --> 00:13:38,605
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Franny ...

182
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:45,362
Stop it. Stop it. No, it's not nice.
Poo-poo, poo-poo. / Poo-poo, poo-poo.

183
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:50,347
Oh, but it feels good to laugh.
I needed that release.

184
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:54,086
Miss Fine Oh, hello again,
Miss Tortello, long time no see.

185
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:57,076
Miss Fine, could you give me
a hand with this cuff link?

186
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:01,168
Mr. Sheffied, could I ask you
a couple of questions? / Uh-huh.

187
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:05,729
If you were, let's say, taking
a nap on the couch

188
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:10,711
where people might, oh — I don't know —
line up to see you,

189
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:17,818
would you be more comfortable in a suit or
something sporty or, let's say, waterproof?

190
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:19,963
What is this? Another "Cosmo" quiz?

191
00:14:19,963 --> 00:14:24,770
I promise, it's the last one
you'll ever have to take.

192
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,335
Oh, that must be my investor.
All right. How do I look?

193
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,330
You look great, just great.

194
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,797
Doesn't he? / Ahhhhhh, boy.

195
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:37,001
Oh, he's at death's door.
/ Oh, I gotta be strong.

196
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:41,369
Franny, my heart goes out to you.
What are you going to do?

197
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:48,831
What can I do? I'm just gonna have to be my usual
charming effervescent life of the party.

198
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:04,808
Sorry, Doug, you'll have to excuse us.
This isn't a typical evening.

199
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:09,885
Yes. You're not home alone sitting
on your foot massager watching "Sisters."

200
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:17,851
So, so tell me, Doug, what's the real story behind
Faye Dunaway in "Sunset Boulevard," huh?

201
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,339
All I know is I have the distinction of being
the only person who ever

202
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:24,714
lost money with Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.

203
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:30,070
You do know that he's been knighted,
don't you? / Oh, he do.

204
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:35,161
You know, everyone in the Sheffield family
tree has a title of Sir or Lord in their name,

205
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:40,075
except for Dad and Uncle Bill,
who thinks he's a leprechaun.

206
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:41,765
Thank you, Margaret.

207
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:45,612
Mr. Sheffield, butter?
/ No, I already have some.
Thank you, Miss Fine!

208
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,715
You're not going to eat that,
are you? / Why not?

209
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:51,979
Ah, because it just fell on the floor.

210
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,948
Sour cream for your potato, sir?
/ Yes — / No.

211
00:16:03,948 --> 00:16:07,089
May I have that, please.

212
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:10,479
Oh, my God, fire. / What?

213
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:16,992
Oh, my mistake.
I must be hallucinating.

214
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:21,029
Niles, what kind of mushrooms
did you put in that soup?

215
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:25,222
Miss Fine, will you pass
me the salt, please.

216
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:29,336
I think we're all out. / No. It's,
it's right there in front of your face.

217
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:33,729
Oh, all right. Here you go.

218
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:39,027
Miss Fine, perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
Please pass the blasted salt.

219
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,838
Thank you. So, Doug, Andrew's
loss is our gain, huh?

220
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,659
Here's to a long and fruit —

221
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:52,941
Miss Fine, what are you doing?
/ Oh, it's okay. It's blow fish.

222
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:56,861
I'm just cooling it off for you.

223
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:59,339
Well, don't. / Well, fine.

224
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,605
Burn your mouth,
but quit hogging the salt. Here.

225
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:09,061
Oh, thank you. Everything is so delicious.
I don't eat like this normally.

226
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,046
Um, I'd — I'd like to make a toast.
/ What a good idea.

227
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:15,010
Hollendaise?
/ Oh, yes, please.

228
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,196
May we sweep the Tony Awards
and enjoy a tenth year —

229
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,799
Have you lost your mind?
What are you doing?

230
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,932
Well, egg is such a good ...

231
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:35,458
It's such a good moisturizer, and
my hands have been so dry lately.

232
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,698
Miss Fine, could I — could I have
a little word with you?

233
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:42,741
Sure. Go ahead.

234
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,023
In the kitchen, please.

235
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,857
I just have to show him where
the toothpicks are.

236
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:53,407
What have I ever done to you?
Why are you trying to destroy me?

237
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,323
Me? I think you're doing a pretty good job
of that yourself, Sir Hollendaise.

238
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:02,143
You know, when you first came to this house,
I thought, oh, she's nuts.

239
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:04,270
But then we began making progress.

240
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,409
I, I actually thought I was beginning to see
the light at the end of the tunnel.

241
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:10,359
Don't go towards the light.

242
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:14,201
You're actually insane.

243
00:18:14,201 --> 00:18:18,491
Have those chemicals you use to color
your hair finally seeped into your brain?

244
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:23,738
I don't color my hair. I just put on
a layer of dark highlights.

245
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,034
I'm calling a doctor. / Why? Are you okay?
Don't you feel all right?

246
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,761
You're scaring me. / Mr. Sheffield, don't be scared.

247
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:33,571
I'll never leave you.
/ Now you're terrifying me.

248
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:38,238
Why can't you follow the menu from your cardiologist?
You know, you're just like my mother.

249
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:43,697
She thinks that if she has an M & M with a glass
of water, it's like taking a One-a-Day.

250
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,300
Miss Fine, this is Emerson's diet.
I'm in perfect health.

251
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,696
The only coronary I'm going to get
around here is over you.

252
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:55,760
So you're not gonna to die?
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,

253
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,638
oh, because, you know, I don't know where
any of the policies are.

254
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,019
I don't want to go through
your drawers and find out

255
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:07,820
that you've been keeping another nanny
on the side all these — huh?

256
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:13,129
You know, strange though it might seem,
this is actually beginning to make sense to me.

257
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:16,830
I'll just go in there and tell him
you're off your medication.

258
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,451
You know, it's really kind of funny when
you think about it. / What?

259
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:25,897
Well, you know, Emerson, you're saying is
the guy with the heart condition. / Yeah.

260
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:34,547
But, meanwhile, I've been putting all of
your sauce and butter and cream on his plate.

261
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:48,823
You know, Miss Fine. There are many ways
a producer can lose a potential backer.

262
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:52,145
He may dislike the show, hate the casting,

263
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:56,202
but death by nanny may actually be a first.

264
00:19:56,202 --> 00:19:58,883
Well, he's not dead yet.

265
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:02,250
Believe me, if there was anything that
I can do to trade places with him,

266
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,504
I wish I was lying in that bed
with tubes coming out of me —

267
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:09,587
although I didn't force
the food down his throat.

268
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:13,009
It's all right. We've nothing
to worry about. / Oh ...

269
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:17,805
You spoke to the doctor?
/ No. The bank. The checked cleared.

270
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:22,020
Maxwell Sheffield? / Yes, yes, yes yes
— how — how is Mr. Emerson?

271
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,747
Absolutely fine. Just a severe
case of gastro indigestion.

272
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:31,752
Must be something he ate.
/ Well, not necessarily. Stress could do it to you too.

273
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:36,335
My friend Val used to sing the National
Anthem at assembly solo.

274
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,194
She would get so stressed out —

275
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:43,900
well, when she got to the part
the "bombs bursting in air,"

276
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:49,237
let's just say she didn't
need a tympany.

277
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:52,274
All right, Miss Fine. Let's go home.

278
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:54,722
You know, life is so strange.

279
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:59,195
One minute you're eating dinner; the next
minute, you're fighting for your life.

280
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:02,073
I'll tell you, it's like
Shakespeare once said,

281
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:07,717
"Like sands through the hour glass,
so are the days of our lives."

282
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:11,619
Well, Miss Fine, let's go back, see the children,
let them know everything's all right.

283
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,415
You know, I love those kids so much

284
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:18,917
that as soon as we get home,
I want to sign that will.

285
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:23,525
But what happens to them if I go first?

286
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:27,117
Then I get to keep them.

287
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:29,973
You see, Miss Fine, they are my children.

288
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:35,026
But what if I'm the one —
/ No, no. I promise, I'm going first.

289
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:39,111
There. Signed, sealed, and delivered.

290
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:42,262
Now take it away. I never want
to see that will again.

291
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:46,821
Were our names mentioned anywhere else?
/ Let me see that will again.

292
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:50,090
I just want to make sure that
I dotted my "I."

293
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:54,019
Nope, no, no. Little smiley face
and everything. / Uh-huh.

294
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:58,134
No matter.
I'm taking the silver anyway.

295
00:21:58,811 --> 00:22:02,029
Look at that, you've got a wall safe
just like in the movies.

296
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,891
Boy, I've been here over a year,
and I never knew that was there.

297
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:07,318
Let's see, right ...

298
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,890
left ...

299
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:12,700
right — what was it?

300
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,779
Forty two, right.

301
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:32,118
Well, good news, "B," that little Erica
made up with her old boyfriend.

302
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:35,523
She didn't want to give up half her Barbie
Dream House in the settlement.

303
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:37,668
Oh ...
/ Right. Yeah.

304
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:41,934
It's so pathetic. This geeky little kid
drooling all over you. / Well, you know ...

305
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,867
Hi, Fran.
/ Hi, honey.

306
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:46,155
This is my friend Pamela.
/ Hi, sweetie.

307
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:48,427
Hi.

308
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,168
Brighten ...
/ Ohhhhh ...
