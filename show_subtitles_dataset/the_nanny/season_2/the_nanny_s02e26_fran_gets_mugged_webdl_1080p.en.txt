1
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:09,296
I can't tell you how it feels to be loaning
an original page of Shakespeare's
notebook to the Metropolitan Museum.

2
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:12,388
Yes, sir. It's a piece of history
and very noble of you to share it.

3
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:15,471
Makes me look damned important,
doesn't it?

4
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:19,450
Shall I have the inseam let
out of your trousers?

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,358
Lending this to the fund raiser will
make us the hit of the social season.

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:28,483
Thank God your uncle croaked
and left it to you.

7
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:31,632
I mean, sorry for your loss.

8
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:35,222
I don't need glasses. / Brighten,
so help me, if you keep this up,

9
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:38,968
I am going to drag you to Loeman's and
make you sit outside of the ladies dressing room

10
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:42,822
in the husband's chair with
my purse in your lap. Huh?

11
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:44,921
Is there a problem, Miss Fine?

12
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:47,062
Brighten doesn't want
to go pick up his glasses.

13
00:00:47,062 --> 00:00:50,696
I can see fine.
/ Oh, Brighten, don't be so vain.

14
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:53,601
Meanwhile, these invitations are gorgeous.

15
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,525
Black guy, optional.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,933
That's "black tie," Miss Fine.

17
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:03,895
Oh, well, I was gonna say ...

18
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:09,222
I don't want to wear some stupid
wire-rimmed, here-comes-Urkel glasses ...

19
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:15,401
which happen to look
excellent on you, dad.

20
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,934
Oh, don't make him wear glasses.

21
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:22,227
He's so short and underdeveloped.

22
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:25,473
I mean, aren't the braces enough?

23
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,995
I'll holder her down;
you tie her tube.

24
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,592
Brighten, you are going, and that's that.
/ There, your father has spoken.

25
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:38,611
But you said he doesn't know
what he's talking about half the —

26
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:41,962
No! This is the other half.
Go get dressed.

27
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:43,850
So, shall I get you the Town car?
/ Oh, no.

28
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,935
It's such a glorious day,
I figure we'll just walk.

29
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:49,124
Walk? In this city?
/ I'm wearing four-inch heels.

30
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:54,209
I can step over anything.
To me a wine-o is just a speed bump.

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,188
Maxwell, we have that meeting
at the museum. / Oh, yes.

32
00:01:57,188 --> 00:02:01,284
Oh, Miss Fine, while you're out, there's
a list of errands on my desk. Would you mind?

33
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:06,868
Oh, no, not at all. Although,
I don't know what we've got a butler for.

34
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,765
"Hamlet of Denmark?"

35
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:13,985
Why can't he just write
"a small Danish ham"?

36
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:19,891
"Montagu's Capulets?"
Well, is that regular or extra strength?

37
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:23,766
Oh, I guess it's whatever I want.
It says here, "as you like it."

38
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:21,236
Wow! Everything's
so clear now.

39
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:24,609
Uh-huh. You know, I really love
the way you look in your glasses.

40
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,949
You've got a whole Bill Hurt
thing happening.

41
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:32,800
You know, I'm seeing fine details I've
never seen before. / Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,189
How old are you?

43
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,987
Take those off.
You look like Urkel.

44
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:46,773
Wow! Look at that thing.

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,306
Is that real?

46
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,103
You're acting like
you've never seen one before.

47
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:54,632
You've got one;
your father's got one.

48
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:57,762
Now, put it here.
Let me see how heavy it is.

49
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:02,077
First of all, Rollex has
two "L's" in it.

50
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,459
Please. What kind of
an idiot is gonna pay —

51
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,609
oh, 20 bucks? I'll take one.
Here, here. Thanks.

52
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,623
Look at that, somebody left an entire
bucket of KFC right on the bench.

53
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:15,368
Oh, people are such pigs.

54
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:17,367
Oh, it's just the dark meat.

55
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:22,059
Give me your purse!
/ Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Oh! Oh!

56
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,168
Are you okay?

57
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:25,507
Oh, my God, Brighten,
we've been mugged.

58
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:27,735
What do we do?
/ Ahhhhh!

59
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:31,192
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,863
Well, at least we've got witnesses.
We've got witnesses.

61
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:44,434
Oy! Oy! Oy! / Fran, Fran, Fran,
let's not worry. I can handle this.

62
00:04:46,264 --> 00:04:48,076
Brighten, get up!

63
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:52,048
Oh, Brighten, I can't believe
this happened to us.

64
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,548
I don't know what do.
I can't even think straight.

65
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,981
Excuse me. Where's Bloomingdales?

66
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:02,183
Oh, well, go over to Lexington,
down to 59th.

67
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:05,702
And the frozen yogurt in the cafe
is not to be missed.

68
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:09,418
Hum, hum. I'll tell you,
if I wasn't just mugged, I'd join you.

69
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:12,290
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

70
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:21,765
Thank goodness you're all right.
All they got was your purse.

71
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:27,818
Oh, you know, it's just like they say,
even after it's gone, you can still feel it.

72
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,775
Now I have to replace
all my credit cards

73
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:42,386
and that driver's license with that fabulous
picture where I look just like Jacquelyn Smith.

74
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:45,493
Oh, man, if I ever see that creep again.

75
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:49,627
Oh, sweetie, don't go
calling him a creep.

76
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:52,805
Deep down inside there's
goodness in everyone.

77
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:56,674
Oh, my God. He's got
my Cadillac red lipstick.

78
00:05:56,674 --> 00:06:02,221
It's discontinued.
I want that creep to fry.

79
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:06,621
Calm down, Miss Fine.
There's plenty of other red lipsticks.

80
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,404
No, never the same.
They out outlawed the dye.

81
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:14,317
Damn Food and Drug Administration.
What are they doing in cosmetics?

82
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:19,564
My mother wore it for 50 years,
and her kids came out normal.

83
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:23,261
You see, I knew something
like this would happen.

84
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:26,956
Your wide-eyed naivete was bound
to get you in trouble sooner or later.

85
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:30,711
Don't call me naive.
That is so condescending of you.

86
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:35,046
And I only appear wide-eyed thanks
to my Maybelline ultra-lash,

87
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:38,369
which was in my purse.

88
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:40,461
Oh, that's the police.

89
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:45,075
The police? I — you called the police?
I asked you not to call the police.

90
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:48,629
Well, I'm not gonna talk to them,
and you can't make me.

91
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:52,838
Did someone here get mugged?
/ Oh, I'm the victim.

92
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,741
Well, hi.
/ Hi.

93
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:03,857
I'm Det. Shoenfeld.
/ Oh, an NYPD Jew.

94
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:08,534
What were you doing walking through
the park, a beautiful woman like you?

95
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:14,936
That is so naive.
/ I know. It's my greatest downfall.

96
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,610
I just said the same bloody thing,
and she nearly bit my head off.

97
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,931
It's all in the delivery, sir.

98
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:26,337
Ah, detective, shouldn't you be
filling out some paperwork?

99
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:28,652
Are you the guy that
threw up and fainted?

100
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:31,205
No. He did.

101
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:33,974
How you doing, son? You okay?

102
00:07:33,974 --> 00:07:35,982
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,695
Did either of you get
a good look at the guy?

104
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:41,440
No. We only saw him for a second.
He had a stocking on his head.

105
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,835
No Nonsense, sheer and silky,
misty toupe, sandal foot.

106
00:07:46,304 --> 00:07:51,559
That's it? / No, no.
He had a run over his left ear.

107
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,167
Thanks. That'll give me something
to go on. / Oh, okay.

108
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,799
Now, make sure you lock your door.
/ Oh, yes, sir.

109
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:03,275
I gotta go because crime is
rampant in the streets.

110
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:07,829
Oh, gee, your wife must feel
so safe having you around.

111
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:11,378
I'm not married. Oy!

112
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:21,188
Oh, please, would you look at her,
swooning all over the place?

113
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:23,103
What? Just because he wears a badge?

114
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:27,514
Shall I fetch those little wings
the stewardess gave you, sir?

115
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,545
They were for Grace. / Really?

116
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:34,378
Then what are they doing in your
jewelry box? / Thank you, Niles.

117
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,161
A simple purse snatching turns deadly
tonight on a very special "Blossom."

118
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:48,158
Gracie, this is serious.
Fran hasn't gotten off that couch all day.

119
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:50,134
I better go talk to her.

120
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:51,768
Ohhhh!

121
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,961
On second thought, you go.

122
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,943
Fran ... / Ahhhh!
/ Ahhhhh!

123
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:06,940
Ahhhhh! What is the matter?
I don't know. You scared me.

124
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:08,866
Okay.

125
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:12,165
Okay. Calm down. Calm down.

126
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:15,253
So the man has my address
and telephone number.

127
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:18,950
Lots of guys do. Do they ever call?

128
00:09:20,873 --> 00:09:24,749
Ah, Fran, um, maybe I should
take Gracie to ballet today.

129
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,994
Good. Good idea.
Yeah, just this once.

130
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:30,278
Now, kids, don't think just
because I was mugged,

131
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:35,074
I'm going to be afraid to face
the world outside this door or anything.

132
00:09:35,294 --> 00:09:38,430
Go! Go! Go! Stay low to the ground.
Serpentine, serpentine.

133
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:43,358
Ahhh! Watch out for that guy,
that scary guy. Oh, it's you, Niles, get in here.

134
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:47,558
Did anyone follow you?
Did you get the stuff?

135
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:51,795
Yes. Hair spray, breath spray,
and pepper spray.

136
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:56,442
Let's say we switch the labels
and give them to Miss Babcock.

137
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:02,537
Niles, I've been victimized.
I don't have time to watch you
torture Miss Babcock.

138
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:05,671
Take pictures.

139
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:08,189
Fran? / What?

140
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:11,848
I feel terrible. I should have defended
you yesterday, but I totally wimped out.

141
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,765
Oh, sweetie, sweetie, listen,

142
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:20,123
all you did was pass out, puke,
and pee in your pants.

143
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:25,147
You were in Central Park.
You fit right in.

144
00:10:27,856 --> 00:10:31,373
Ask yourself, punk, do you feel lucky?

145
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:37,376
What was all that about? / Oh, the expert
is teaching Brighten how to repel a man.

146
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:43,752
Well, if you'll excuse me, sir,
I'll take your Shakespeare down to the framer.

147
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:45,772
I thought you already did that, Niles.

148
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:51,056
But it was right here. No one's been
in here except you and me, Cee Cee and —

149
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:54,673
Miss Fine! / Oh, now, sir,
you're jumping to conclusions.

150
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:59,151
Why do you always blame —
Miss Fine!

151
00:10:59,948 --> 00:11:01,960
I heard you the first time.

152
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,178
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, did you see a very
ancient document on this desk yesterday morning?

153
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:09,788
You mean Chita Rivera's resume?

154
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:15,203
It was my Shakespeare. It's missing,
and you were the last one in here.

155
00:11:15,203 --> 00:11:18,469
All right. Don't panic.
Let's just retrace our steps.

156
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,907
Now, I came in with that whole
Brighten eye glasses issue,

157
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:25,037
and then you said, Miss Fine —
oh, no — that was just now.

158
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:28,284
Anyway, Cee Cee said something stupid,
and then you nailed her with that

159
00:11:28,284 --> 00:11:33,889
tube-tying zinger, which
I'm still laughing about. Ah-ha!

160
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,809
Thank you.

161
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:39,238
And yatta, yatta, yatta. You asked me
to run your errands. I walked over here

162
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:45,374
to pick up the list. "Brown shoe laces,
foot powder, Earl gray" — ah-oh.

163
00:11:45,528 --> 00:11:51,881
Ah-oh, what? / Oh, please, tell me
Macbeth is something you eat with Mcfries.

164
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:00,140
You took the Shakespeare
instead of my list?

165
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,797
Please tell me it wasn't
in your purse.

166
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:03,399
It wasn't in my purse.

167
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,162
Are you lying?
/ Uh-huh.

168
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:12,698
I told you to take the bloody Town car.
Oh, but, oh, no, you had to walk.

169
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:18,166
That document lasted 350 years
before it met you.

170
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:22,687
Oh, my God, what about the benefit?
Oh, I'm going to be humiliated.

171
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:26,756
Oh, now, calm down, calm down.
Maybe no one will show up.

172
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:29,785
Maxwell, it's a sell-out.
Look at this.

173
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:33,324
The princess of Wales is coming.

174
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:39,590
Diana? I love her. Oh, can I go?

175
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,121
Yes, Miss Fine. You can go and explain
to everyone why you're toothless.

176
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:50,261
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought it was
some fancy-smancy piece of stationery.

177
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:56,829
I spent two hours trying to find a pizza
place called "Two Gentlemen of Barona."

178
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,350
Shakespeare's gone.
It was in Miss Fine's stolen purse.

179
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:03,643
I'll kill you.

180
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:11,616
Sir ...

181
00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:21,121
Sir, aren't you going to stop her?

182
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:23,281
Oh, I will.

183
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:26,820
So they found the perpetrator,
and Miss Fine is the only witness.

184
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,048
Stop! Stop! Stop! We need her alive.

185
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:32,908
Get dressed. You and I are going
down to the police station

186
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:36,203
to identify the suspect in a lineup
and hope to God he's still got my Shakespeare.

187
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:39,674
I don't want to identify him.
What if he comes back and tries to kill me?

188
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:42,377
Then he can stand in bloody line.

189
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,558
You care more about that stupid piece
of paper than you do about me.

190
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:52,035
Oh, no, Miss Fine, that —
that's not what I meant.

191
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:56,887
No, of course we care about you.
Get her, Niles.

192
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:59,679
Oh, no, I don't want to go.
You can't make me. Oh, Niles,

193
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,271
please, for my obituary picture,
use the green jump suit from Puerto Rico.

194
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:07,266
I was thin and tan and having
a terrific hair day.

195
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,088
Do you recognize any of them?

196
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:28,535
Can No. 4 push his hair back?
/ Push your hair back, No. 4.

197
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:32,283
Now, you're talking.
/ Is that him?

198
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:34,966
No. But doesn't he look better?

199
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:40,082
Miss Fine, please concentrate.
/ Oh, all right. It's hard to tell.

200
00:14:40,082 --> 00:14:42,820
He was wearing a stocking at the time.

201
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,925
Put on the stockings.

202
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:52,660
Oh, my God, it's him.
The Sheer Elegance, all-day beige,

203
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,258
between the control top
and the cotton crotch ...

204
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,132
No. 2!

205
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:01,568
It's No. 2.

206
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,284
Excuse me, detective, where
do we recover our property?

207
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:12,273
What?
/ Well, the items that were stolen.

208
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:21,050
Oh, this is your first time, isn't it?
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

209
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,252
Hey, Jim, wait'll you hear this one.

210
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:30,445
My Shakespeare.
/ Oh, Mr. Sheffield, let it go.

211
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:36,072
It's like my grandmother always used to say.
"Life is like a box of chocolates."

212
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:38,425
That's from "Forrest Gump."

213
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:41,254
And they paid her nothing.

214
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:49,326
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, cheer up.

215
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,635
Here, we'll watch a little TV.
That'll take your mind right off of Shakespeare.

216
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:56,847
Brush up your Shakespeare.

217
00:15:56,847 --> 00:16:01,766
Now back to Severelli's
"Romeo and Juliette." / Oh, no.

218
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:06,358
Oh, wait, wait. They were just
about to show Romeo's touche.

219
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:09,652
Miss Fine, please, get me somewhere else.

220
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,676
Mr. Sheffield, look on the bright side.

221
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:14,563
Instead of your paper,
it could be me that's missing.

222
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:17,208
Don't try to cheer me up.

223
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,398
You know, I've got half a mind —
/ Well, you've got no argument here.

224
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:26,026
Well ... / So help me, Miss Fine,
if I don't get that Shakespeare back —

225
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,620
You know, you can't bully me,
Maxwell Sheffield.

226
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,422
I am not some weak woman — Hiiii ...

227
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,789
Hi ... Look at her. The minute
he arrives, she gets so ...

228
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:40,640
Docile, sir?
/ Yes. How does he do that?

229
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,072
Fran, I don't want you to panic.
/ What? What?

230
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:45,724
We had to release him. He's going
to do community service.

231
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:50,535
Oh, what kind of justice is this?
He mugs me, and he walks?

232
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:55,076
That's the way the system works.
We lock 'em up; they let them out.

233
00:16:55,076 --> 00:16:58,833
Meanwhile, I ate a couple of
bing cherries in the A & P,

234
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,932
and I'm rustled to the ground
like Squeaky Frome.

235
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:08,374
Look at you, you sweet little thing.
What you need is a man around the house.

236
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:13,416
All right. That's it. First of all,
there is a man around the house.

237
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,694
I'll lay out your pajamas, sir.
Would you like warm milk or cocoa?

238
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,858
Thank you, Niles. You're fired.

239
00:17:21,084 --> 00:17:24,177
And, secondly, there is absolutely
nothing sweet about her.

240
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:28,065
Weren't you headed upstairs?
/ She happens to be brave, confident, and gutsy.

241
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:32,518
And you've turned her into
a simpering, whimpering child again.

242
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,972
Anyway, I don't like what you've done to her.

243
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:40,849
This is not the woman
I know and, and... know.

244
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:45,336
Oh, Mr. Sheffield. / So, thank
you for stopping by, officer.

245
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:50,386
She'll be just fine. So why don't you
just run along and write some tickets. Huh?

246
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:54,693
Great. I'll start with the limo
parked out front in the red zone.

247
00:17:54,968 --> 00:18:00,644
Go ahead. Do the ticket.
Do ten bloody tickets. I don't care?

248
00:18:00,806 --> 00:18:04,367
I feel sorry for that poor
bloke whose limo it is.

249
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,374
Now, come on, Miss Fine,
when you fall off a horse,

250
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:16,102
it's very important that
you get right back on.

251
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:19,517
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, that horse
analogy never worked with me.

252
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:23,016
If I fall off a horse,
I'm calling Jacoby & Meyers.

253
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,618
Meanwhile, that little talk Brighten had with
Miss Babcock seems to be working out well.

254
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:31,734
Are you talking to me?

255
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:34,585
Are you talking to me?

256
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,686
Yeah ...

257
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:42,707
Oh, my God, it's a mugger.
There's the mugger.

258
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:45,735
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, calm down.
That's not him.

259
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:48,891
Honestly, every corner we turn,
you think you've seen your assailant.

260
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:51,609
Well, that other one really
looked like him.

261
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:53,814
That was Yoko Ono.

262
00:18:53,814 --> 00:18:58,656
Yoko Ono. Oh, I love the way she sings.

263
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:01,838
Ahhhhh! / It's all right.
I know, I've got the album.

264
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:05,427
No. No. Ahhhh! The mugger,
the mugger, the mugger.

265
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,427
Oh, God, it's you. No. Don't be scared.

266
00:19:07,427 --> 00:19:11,201
I'm not scared. This man is
an expert at Tai Babalonia.

267
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:15,103
That's — that's tae kwon do,
Miss Fine. / Oh.

268
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:19,760
I'm bad, I'd bad. Ahhhh!
/ Ahhhh! Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

269
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,026
I swear I've never stolen
anything before in my life.

270
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:27,633
I've been dying to tell you, but I'm not
allowed within 40 feet of your house.

271
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,779
Why? Are you single and Jewish?

272
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,548
You see, I'm just down on my luck.
I can't pay my bills.

273
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,851
Well, get a job.
/ They repossessed my car.

274
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:38,655
Take a bus.
/ I had to move in with my mother.

275
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:41,274
Oh, give him a 50.

276
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,694
I don't know how to make it up to you,

277
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:46,622
but I thought I'd start by returning
something that looked really important.

278
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:48,441
Oh, my lipstick, my lipstick.

279
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:50,862
Oh, my God, my Shakespeare.

280
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:55,101
Say, if you're a Shakespeare fan,
there's a festival in New Jersey.

281
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:58,205
I'd be honored if you'd let me
treat you to two tickets.

282
00:19:58,205 --> 00:20:03,938
I don't think so. / Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
the kids are gonna be away all weekend at tennis camp,

283
00:20:03,938 --> 00:20:08,458
and besides we would pass
by the Donna Karan Outlet Store in Secaucus.

284
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:12,165
You know what? We'll go
on Saturday, but not too close,

285
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:14,799
cause it's very talky, and they spit.

286
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,152
Bless you. Thank you.

287
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:18,887
Miss Fine, to borrow
from your vernacular.

288
00:20:18,887 --> 00:20:22,886
I'm not schlepping out to New Jersey
just to relieve your mugger's conscience.

289
00:20:22,886 --> 00:20:25,180
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, forgive and forget.

290
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,461
Like my grandmother always says,
"All's well that ends well."

291
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,444
That's from Shakespeare, Miss Fine.

292
00:20:31,444 --> 00:20:34,702
And, again, she got nothing.

293
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,810
Don't look, Miss Fine, but there's
a man in a French coat headed this way.

294
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:41,066
Oh, no, that guy's
just selling Rollexes.

295
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:44,833
You know, I should get one
for my father. Ah, come here.

296
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:49,001
Open up. Let me see what you got. Ohhhhh!

297
00:20:57,037 --> 00:21:01,236
Oh, I'll tell you "Hamlet"
is my new favorite play —

298
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:04,518
people eating prime ribs with their hands;

299
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:07,249
everybody stabbing each other in the back.

300
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:09,839
I'll tell you, put "Felonious"
in a powder blue tux,

301
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,142
you got my cousin Claudine's wedding.

302
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:17,660
Oh, it's good to have you back,
Miss Fine. I missed you.

303
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,502
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
is that you talking,

304
00:21:21,502 --> 00:21:24,958
or is it that bottle of Don
Corlioni we had in the limo.

305
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:28,828
That's Dom Perignon, Miss Fine.
/ Oh, whatever.

306
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:30,334
Oh, Miss Fine ...

307
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:33,913
Fran ...

308
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:36,917
Mr. Max?

309
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:51,337
Oh, my God. / We've been cleaned out.

310
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:55,181
What are the odds the one night
that we went to the theater?

311
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,605
I'd say the odds are pretty good when
the robber gives us the bloody tickets, Miss Fine.

312
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:03,024
Goodness in everyone, hey?
/ Well, at least he left the one
thing that can't be replaced.

313
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:06,417
Niles.
/ Oh, yeah, Niles.

314
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:11,328
Oh, oh, the alarm company called me.
