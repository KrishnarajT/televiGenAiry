00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:19,080
Fran thinks this is scary?
Some Egyptian guy wrapped up in Charmin?

3
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:22,756
This is so woosie.

4
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:26,174
Boo!

5
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:34,621
Oh, I used to love doing
that to Ma. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

6
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:39,125
Thank God for plastic slip covers.

7
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:45,310
Oh, Gracie, honey, isn't this
a little too intense for you?

8
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,536
No, I'm fine with this.
It's "60 Minutes" I can't take.

9
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:53,676
Do you know what goes on in
a chicken processing plant?

10
00:00:53,676 --> 00:00:56,143
Your pizza. / Yummy.

11
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:59,754
I'm so glad we ordered from this place.
Not only do they give you extra cheese,

12
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:03,462
but you get a free beverage. Humm.

13
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:06,878
Okay. Dig in.

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,106
I only want one slice. / Me too.
Pizza is very fatening.

15
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:14,194
Fran, that's two. / No, honey,
not when you eat it like this.

16
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:16,922
The body doesn't know.

17
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:21,583
This is so bogus. Horror films today
are much more realistic.

18
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:26,223
Oh, right. Whenever I'm in a cabin in
the woods, the first thing I do is just

19
00:01:26,223 --> 00:01:30,626
rip off my top and start
dancing the frug.

20
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:33,681
You know, we should go camping.

21
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:38,418
In classic horror films,
violence is never shown.

22
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:40,443
I believe it was Alfred
Hitchcock who said,

23
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:44,015
"There's nothing more frightening
than an unopened door."

24
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:51,671
Niles, show our visitor to
the guest room, would you.

25
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:53,913
Right this way.
/ Thank you ...

26
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,858
Good night, Miss Fine.

27
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:05,358
Good night, Miss Fine? Is there
something you'd like to tell me?

28
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,574
Ah, pleasant dreams. See you
in the morning. What?

29
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:13,083
Oh, I don't know.
How was your day? The weather?

30
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,520
King Tut in the trench coat?

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,511
I'd rather not discuss that
if you don't mind.

32
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:22,138
We simply have a house guest who's
recovering from some surgery.

33
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:27,890
Oh, I get it. Some hot-shot celeb.
A little nip, a little tuck.
Hush, hush; right?

34
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,734
Absolutely. / Well, smart you.
The less who know the better.

35
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,732
We'll just keep it between us.
All right, dish ...

36
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:41,381
What does hell freezing over
have to do with — Oh

37
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:43,348
Good night, Miss Fine.

38
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:46,691
I can't believe you trust me
to take care of your children;

39
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:50,736
you trust me to mail
important documents ...

40
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:56,443
And you don't trust me with
one little itty-bitty secret?

41
00:02:56,443 --> 00:03:00,683
That about sums it up. / So you're
not going to tell me who she is?

42
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:06,167
She is none of your business.
/ She — all right. I know it's a woman.

43
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,739
And I know she's definitely
not a redhead.

44
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,871
How do you know she's not a redhead?
/ Aha!

45
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:17,842
Not a redhead. Mr. Sheffield, you're in way
over your head. You might as well just tell me.

46
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:20,909
Look, all you've succeeded in doing
is strengthening my resolve.

47
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,879
I'm not saying another word.
/ Oh ...

48
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,832
Hello. Hold on.

49
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,490
It's Larry Fortenski on the phone.

50
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,398
Oh, all right. I'll take it in the office.
/ Okay, okay. Ah, Liz.

51
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,367
Say hello to your mother for me.

52
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,466
Hi, Ma.

53
00:04:33,434 --> 00:04:35,809
Hi, Miss Babcock.

54
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:40,225
Maxwell isn't here, and if it's about
the children, I'm not interested.

55
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:44,854
And if it's about you,
I'm really not interested.

56
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:48,893
I just came in for a little girl talk.
/ With me?

57
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:53,688
Yeah. We're both women.
I don't care what Niles says.

58
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:59,231
So tell me, who does
he got up in that room?

59
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:03,327
It's just killing you, isn't it,

60
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:08,466
that Maxwell and I have little secrets
that you know nothing about.

61
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,111
He didn't tell you either.

62
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:16,566
No. That tight-lipped
little sconehead.

63
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:22,169
It's because we're women. / It's outrageous.
Men think they can't trust us.

64
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,180
Well, it's insulting.
Did you check the safe?

65
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,643
It's the first place I looked.

66
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:30,759
Oh, boy, this is just like
"Mission Impossible."

67
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,971
Remember when the little Japanese
ballerina would peel off her face

68
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:38,384
and it would be Martin Landau?

69
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:43,983
Oh, oh, I have located
the black box. / Oh ...

70
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:48,528
His lap-top computer. I can't believe
he just leaves this lying around.

71
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:55,507
Miss Babcock ... Babs, baby ...

72
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:58,894
Babby, honey.

73
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:02,486
No, no, it's all right.
I do this all the time.

74
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,502
How do you think I know where
he is every minute of the day.

75
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:09,959
Now what was his pass word?
/ Busted?

76
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:16,870
No, Maxwell, never — oh, oh, oh, oh,
Maxwell. Thank God you're here.

77
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:23,350
I was just looking for the,
the (inaudible) file, and

78
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,653
oh, I remember where
I left that.

79
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,771
Stay out of the guest room.
/ Ha, ha, ha.

80
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:34,099
Oh, boy, you know, you'd think
she'd have better things to do

81
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:38,303
with her time than riffling
through your stuff.

82
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:41,997
So, what brings you here,
Miss Fine?

83
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:46,169
Oh — / No problem
with the children?

84
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,733
Oh, no. Kids are wonderful.

85
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:53,670
Household running okay?
/ Oh, like clockwork.

86
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:56,695
Anything on fire? / No, no.

87
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:59,638
Then get out.

88
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:05,769
You probably think that I'm snooping
around like Miss Babcock.

89
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:11,638
Well, let me just tell you something.
It's pretty sad a man in your position

90
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:15,789
doesn't even know who
he can trust.

91
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:29,529
Well, it can't be Lonnie
because she's in court.

92
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,573
It can't be Melanie Griffith
because she's in court;

93
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:41,791
Kristy Brinkly, court;
court; court; rehab.

94
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:46,712
Baby born with antler.

95
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:51,429
Wow, that sounds like
the episiotomy from hell.

96
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:56,495
Hi, everybody. / Brighten Sheffield,
what have you got there?

97
00:07:56,495 --> 00:08:00,213
Oh, no, not another pet.
/ What? I'm good with animals.

98
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,991
Well, let's see. There were the gold fish,
the hamsters, the white mice, the turtle.

99
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:07,978
Our back yard is practically
a pet boot hill.

100
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:11,724
Meanwhile, the roses were
gorgeous this year.

101
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,340
Oh, look, Brighten's
got a bird.

102
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,360
Poly want an afterlife?

103
00:08:18,054 --> 00:08:20,087
Hey, my friend Justin has
to get rid of it.

104
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:23,673
It's supposed to talk, but all it
says is "Raymond loves Lola."

105
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:26,541
Does it deserve to die for that?

106
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:30,557
Niles, Raymond is Justin's dad.
Lola is the upstairs' maid.

107
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:32,164
Ah ... / Uh-huh.

108
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:37,970
Oh, well, I bet they were bouncing more
than quarters on those sheets.

109
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:42,993
Now, where was I? Oh, look,

110
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:48,008
Roseanne threw a party to burn
her Tom tattoo off her butt.

111
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:51,031
What does one serve
at a thing like that?

112
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,442
I don't know. But at my Cousin Steven's
bris they served tri-tip.

113
00:08:57,392 --> 00:09:01,492
Niles, that's what you're
serving to a celebrity for lunch?

114
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:04,981
Give her a sandwich.
/ This is a sandwich.

115
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:07,764
She has to eat everything
through a straw.

116
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:12,880
It's vile. Think "Silence
of the Lambs." Pssss.

117
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:18,580
You know what? Let me bring it up to her.
I'm used to that sound.

118
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,994
You've obviously never seen
my father working a chicken neck.

119
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:25,652
Nice try, Miss Fine.

120
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:30,961
Well, you know, Niles, I mean it's one thing
for Mr. Sheffield to keep a secret from me,

121
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:35,092
but to give you such a slap
in the face. If I were you,

122
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:40,338
I would walk myself right into his office
and demand that he tell you who's up there,

123
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:43,038
really loud.

124
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:46,750
Miss Fine, unlike you,
I don't care who it is.

125
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,128
Oh, you know.

126
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:53,075
You bet ya, baby.

127
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:55,639
Why would he tell you and not me?

128
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,104
Because Niles wasn't caught leading
a Conga line with my filing cabinet.

129
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:06,563
You know, I knew you misread that.
That was static cling.

130
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:10,472
What is it with women, Niles? They always
want to know what isn't their business

131
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:13,819
so they can share it with other women
whose business it also isn't.

132
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:17,771
Oh, if that isn't the most sexist
thing I have ever heard.

133
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:22,490
Like men don't gamp. / Miss Fine,
men aren't interested in gossip.

134
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,539
Absolutely not. I tuned out when the Turnbolt's
butler told me about the little chippie
the master has on the side.

135
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:33,060
Niles, that's old news. It was all
over the steam room months ago.

136
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:36,959
Including the fact that he's put her up
in an apartment in Trump Tower.

137
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,861
Umm, but fo they also know he had
the entire thing done in leather? / No?

138
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:47,380
Which one of your girls is
getting the bikini wax?

139
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,884
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:01,531
I'm sorry. Did you call me?

141
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:05,426
Good. You're sleeping.

142
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:08,213
Ssshhh ... Ssshhh ...

143
00:11:08,213 --> 00:11:12,506
La-la-by, and good night.

144
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:18,344
You're too short to be
Candice Bergen.

145
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:26,861
Ummmmm ... rule out Dolly Parton too.

146
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:35,054
Ssshhh ... Ssshhh ... You know,
you're very brave. Surgery's not for me.

147
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:40,550
I'll stick with my thigh cream.
It tingles cellulite away.

148
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,803
I don't know if it works,
but I don't hate it.

149
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:50,060
Fran ...
/ You scared me.

150
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,993
Did you find out
who it is yet?

151
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:54,085
Honey, what did
I tell you about snooping?

152
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:55,853
That there should
always be a lookout.

153
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:58,633
Good. Go wait in the hall.
/ Right.

154
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:06,175
Let's take a look at your eyes.

155
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:10,160
Hum ... Brown ...

156
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,680
Let's just see your mouth.

157
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,465
It's not a straw.

158
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:29,324
Oh, honey, what were you worried
about your looks for?

159
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:34,692
That tickles.

160
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,335
Miss Fine!

161
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:45,190
Oh, yeah. Temperature's normal.
Drink plenty of fluids.

162
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,340
What do you think you're doing here?
/ Ummmm ...

163
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,262
Daddy's coming?
/ Right.

164
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:58,165
What do you have to say for yourself?
/ Well, I hope you don't think this is my fault.

165
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:01,007
Oh, of course not. Of course not.
It's my fault.

166
00:13:01,007 --> 00:13:04,235
Well, I forgive you. Now let's
get on with our lives.

167
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:06,565
You may not have one much longer.

168
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:10,767
Well, none of this would have happened
if you had just told me who she was.

169
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,027
Cher.

170
00:13:14,362 --> 00:13:18,787
Well, sharing is what it is all about.

171
00:13:20,284 --> 00:13:23,574
Cher. / No. Don't tell me.

172
00:13:23,574 --> 00:13:26,280
Talk to him. I give and give.

173
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,569
You know, she's really
very good with children.

174
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:33,367
But do you think that earns his trust?
No. He still won't tell me who you are.

175
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,608
Cher.

176
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:41,926
I heard you.

177
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:48,121
Are you sure it wasn't
a head injury?

178
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:52,504
Grammie, Emmy, Oscar.

179
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:56,417
Rita Moreno?

180
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:03,293
Maggie stuffs her bra.

181
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,961
Maggie stuffs her bra.

182
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:15,427
Come on, say it. / Master Brighten,
stop torturing that bird.

183
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:16,784
It's very cruel.

184
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:21,334
Yeah, I think he's having a better day than
that cornish hen you've got your fist in.

185
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:29,529
All right. Let's pick up
where we left off.

186
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:35,641
Miss Babcock's embezzling.
Miss Babcock's embezzling.

187
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:41,302
Of course, I can't believe Cher
sucked on my finger.

188
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:45,952
Just listen, carefully, Miss Fine.
Cher trusts me to keep this thing quiet.

189
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:50,651
Oh, you know who would just die
if they found out Cher was here?

190
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:54,631
You will, Miss Fine. You will die
if anyone finds out.

191
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:57,600
My cousin Ira is her biggest fan.

192
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,332
He does an impersonation of her in
a drop-dead gorgeous Bob Mackey gown.

193
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:07,998
I'll tell you, why she's a star and
he's a kosher butcher —

194
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,836
Oh, I guess it's all who you know.
/ Cousin Ira?

195
00:15:12,836 --> 00:15:18,366
Hey, he's the best female impersonator
to come out of Queens. No pun intended.

196
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:22,275
Miss Fine, please, just, just promise me
you won't say a word about this to anyone.

197
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:26,033
Will you calm down.
I can keep a secret.

198
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:30,125
Who am I going to tell?
/ Hi, Fran.

199
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:34,142
I can't tell.
/ Tell me what?

200
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,087
Who the celebrity is recovering from
surgery up in the guest bedroom.

201
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:40,443
So stop hounding me.

202
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:42,817
All right.
So can I have a soda too?

203
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:47,403
Well, there's only one left.
We'll have to share.

204
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:53,376
What's wrong with you? / Nothing, nothing.
Can we please change the subject?

205
00:15:54,729 --> 00:16:00,175
So, tell me, have your parents
gotten that time-share yet?

206
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:04,111
No. They decided
they didn't like Florida.

207
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:08,106
Why? The weather's
so nice and sunny.

208
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:11,543
It was a bad neighborhood.

209
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:15,442
Full of Gypsies,
tramps, and thieves?

210
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:19,479
Oh, my God. It's Cher.

211
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,665
Who told you?

212
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,544
Oh, wow, the house is
surrounded by reporters.

213
00:16:29,544 --> 00:16:32,393
Well, I wouldn't
say surrounded.

214
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:36,833
They're just on three sides and
the second floor balcony.

215
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,092
I can't believe dad didn't tell us
Cher was staying here.

216
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:46,079
How'd the press find out? / Oh, who knows.
Probably somebody blabbed to some friend.

217
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,716
Who is about to die.

218
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:55,660
Back, back, you turn of
the sticks born of Satan.

219
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,371
Thank you very much and
have a nice day.

220
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:04,110
One must be firm but never rude.

221
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,756
Niles, I think you — I think you left
Miss Babcock out there. / Oh, did I?

222
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:11,630
Niles!
/ Oh, there she is.

223
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:22,118
Miss Fine!
/ Are you speaking to me?

224
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:27,053
Miss Fine! You've got
some splaining to do.

225
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,156
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I'm sure you think
I have something to do with that,

226
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:35,281
but they could have found out in
a million different ways.

227
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:37,959
Such as? / Um, ah ...

228
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:41,266
Hey, guys, the bird's finally talking.
/ Not now, Brighten.

229
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:45,997
Well, don't ignore the children.
You know, it's always business with you.

230
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:50,128
So are you going to talk for us?
Speak, pretty bird. Pretty bird.

231
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:52,824
Well, it's Cher.

232
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:59,117
Val, I can't believe you blabbed.

233
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,762
I only told one person.
/ Who?

234
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:04,405
My priest, Father Baretta.

235
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:06,969
That yenta?

236
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,185
Was he wearing his collar?
/ Ah, no.

237
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:13,581
Val, how many times do I have to tell you.
When they don't wear their collar,

238
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:18,252
it's like they have their fingers
crossed behind their back.

239
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:22,939
This is just like being called
into the principal's office.

240
00:18:23,372 --> 00:18:25,304
All right, all right.
Here's what we're going to do.

241
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,219
It'll be just like in high school.
I'll make up the story. You stick to it.

242
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:32,344
I was supposed to stick to it?

243
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,634
I'm going to get suspended.

244
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,869
Sit.

245
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:51,853
I am most disappointed
in you two ladies.

246
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:56,006
That's it, Val. We're not going
to get into college.

247
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,715
So you find this amusing, Miss Fine?
/ No, Mr. Sheffield.

248
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:03,997
I expected more from you two.

249
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:08,981
Tears won't work in this office,
Miss Torello.

250
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:12,220
He's going to call my mother.

251
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,686
Mr. Sheffield, please, let her go.
It was all my fault.

252
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:18,500
I'll take the wrap. Again.

253
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:22,078
Thanks, Fran.
I gotta go to confession.

254
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,488
No names.

255
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,763
I just don't know what to say.

256
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:31,800
Thanks to you, Cher is a virtual
prisoner in this house.

257
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,705
Mr. Sheffield, if I told you

258
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:40,536
that I had a way to solve everything,
would you forgive me?

259
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:42,433
Yes.

260
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:45,736
Got any ideas?

261
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:55,460
All right, Ladies and
Gentlemen of the press,

262
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,332
Cher has agreed to
this photo opportunity

263
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:02,188
in the hopes that you might finally
agree to leave her alone.

264
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:04,146
All right. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

265
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:08,018
Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me..
/ This better work.

266
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:14,586
Would you relax? My Cousin Ira will
do a few bits from his act.

267
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:17,771
Before the press get wise,
Cher will be out the kitchen door

268
00:20:17,771 --> 00:20:21,980
and back to pushing detangler on QVC.

269
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:29,203
Honey, is Cousin Ira ready?
/ He's dressed like a lady.

270
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:34,422
Oh, I know. And I'll explain
everything later. Thank you ...

271
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:37,583
What?

272
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,448
Oh, I was just thinking,
before you came into my life,

273
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:44,495
I never had the need for
an emergency transvestite.

274
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:52,151
I'm telling you, Cousin Ira is going to
be the perfect distraction.

275
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,423
It can't fail.

276
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:58,091
Besides, there's no time
to think of anything else.

277
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:28,838
What was the last place
he passed for Cher? Sea World?

278
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,409
Oh, well, Cher just had surgery.

279
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:37,090
We'll tell them she's
still on cortizone.

280
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:42,950
Well, the press certainly
loved Cousin Ira.

281
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:47,620
You know, my Aunt Reni makes
all of his costumes.

282
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,008
That dong he was wearing,
used to be their hammock.

283
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:57,553
Yes, he was riveting. Especially
the part where his leotards failed.

284
00:21:57,811 --> 00:22:02,998
Oh, I know, I mean, I've heard of
runs but never a blow-out.

285
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:06,424
Well, at least Cher got out
safe and sound.

286
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:12,047
Yeah. Although I'm afraid Cousin Ira's
having one hell of a time hailing a cab.

287
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:14,712
All is well that ends well. Hey?
/ Yeah.

288
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:20,437
I just hope you finally learned your lesson
about the consequences of idle female gossip.

289
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:24,767
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Turnbolt to see you.
/ Raymond, what on earth are you doing here?

290
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:30,066
My son wants his bird back. Oh, and by the way,
I hope the press wasn't too much of an inconvenience?

291
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:33,919
Press? / Yes, I'm the one
that tipped them off.

292
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,804
You knew Cher was staying in the house?
/ Yeah. Max told me in the steamroom.

293
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,150
You promised not to tell.

294
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,133
And you promised not to tell about
my girl friend in Trump Tower.

295
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:52,103
I guess that makes us square.

296
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:57,727
Well, um,

297
00:22:57,727 --> 00:22:59,818
good night, Miss Fine.
