1
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:06,595
Oh, Gracie, I think it's so sweet
that you're writing the President a letter.

2
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:09,079
I mean, he really needs
some cheering up.

3
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:11,471
First, he loses
the House and the Senate,

4
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:17,475
then he jogs to McDonald's and
finds out a McLean has 10 grams of fat.

5
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,514
Ten? What about
those Chicken McNuggets?

6
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:27,193
Niles, so that's how you got
those McLove handles.

7
00:00:28,257 --> 00:00:33,601
Fran, I don't know what's right.
What's the right way to address
the man who runs our entire country?

8
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,006
Dear Newt?

9
00:00:36,798 --> 00:00:39,655
Don't be so smart, you.

10
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:42,531
"B," you're a good writer.
Go help your sister.

11
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:45,908
If it's a nice letter, forget it.
/ What? What are you? A republican?

12
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:49,343
I've got a trust fund.
I'm no boob. / Go.

13
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,683
Maxwell, if he wants the damn play,
then let him have it.

14
00:00:52,683 --> 00:00:55,208
It isn't even finished.
/ Who?

15
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:59,657
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

16
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:03,061
Look, Cee Cee, I found this play first.
I want to produce it.

17
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:08,842
Just once I want to be on top.
/ I want you on top too, Maxwell.

18
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:15,014
You're just not going to win.

19
00:01:15,014 --> 00:01:19,453
You might as well give up.
Se la vie. / La vie.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,799
Why shouldn't he try for it?
His shows are just as good.

21
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,949
As good as "Phantom of the Opera"?
/ Uh-huh.

22
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:33,227
Maxwell, for your own good, give up.
It's a futile fight.

23
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:37,810
For God sakes,
I know when I'm licked.

24
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:45,895
Just give me a minute to get
that image out of my head.

25
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:49,734
Nope, Nope.
Gonna have to live with it.

26
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:52,701
It is reassuring no know that
if anything happens to me,

27
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:55,863
you're here to continue my work.

28
00:01:55,863 --> 00:02:00,051
Well, maybe she's right.
I should just withdraw the offer.

29
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:02,819
That way it won't look like
I've lost to him again.

30
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,154
Lost? You haven't even begun to fight.

31
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:12,270
Mr. Sheffield the only thing that Andrew Lloyd
Webber has that you don't is a middle name.

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,529
I've got a middle name.
/ Oh, well, there you are. What is it?

33
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:18,259
Beverly.
/ Moving on.

34
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:23,159
Okay. Here's something else
that you have that he doesn't.

35
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,944
Yeah? What's that, Miss Fine?
/ Me. Right, Niles?

36
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:30,843
What about a Whopper?

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,002
Fran, you know, Clifford,
that geek at my school?

38
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,569
Uh-huh. Oh, honey, you know,
he's not such a geek.

39
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,870
Not everyone can pull off mittens
clipped to their sleeves.

40
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:34,394
Well, he offered to help me
with my PSAT's. / Yeah?

41
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:37,417
But I can't be seen with him.
/ Sweetie, it's the '90's.

42
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:50,176
Ohhhh ...

43
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,954
Listen to me. You'll be smart.

44
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:55,593
Meanwhile, I'm a maid.

45
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:59,738
All right. It's all set. I'm taking
the playwright to dinner tonight.

46
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:02,491
And I happen to know he fancies
himself as a bit of a ladies' man

47
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:05,464
so I thought maybe I'd set
him up with Cindy, huh?

48
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:08,794
Nothing like a super model
on the rebound. Hey? / Ohhhh.

49
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:13,178
Now, you see, Mr. Sheffield, that's
why you're wearing Donna Karan,

50
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:19,125
and I'm wearing — well, actually,
I'm wear Donna Karan too,
but they cut the label out.

51
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:24,543
So what's this guy like? / Dakota Williams?
Oh, he's an elderly southern gentleman,

52
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:30,701
you know, a real man's man, ah, drinking,
chain smoking, plain talking.

53
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,855
Oh, gee, and you want to fix
him up with Cindy Crawford.

54
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:38,212
I don't know.
From Richard Gear to Yosemite Sam?

55
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,129
You know what, leave everything to me.
I have just the gal for you —

56
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:46,268
cheap, foul-mouthed, finds
secondhand smoke a big turn-on.

57
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:49,794
Oh, Miss Fine, you wouldn't
want to go with him.

58
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:54,195
I didn't mean me.

59
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:56,653
I hate smoke.

60
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,650
Do you think you can convince this
friend of yours to go out with him?

61
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,511
Oh, I don't know. She's got to be
willing to have cocktails in a mansion,

62
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,643
dinner at a five-star restaurant,

63
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:10,187
and ride around all night in a limo with
some famous guy who's too old to jump her.

64
00:05:10,187 --> 00:05:12,752
Gonna be tough.

65
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:21,705
Now, Niles, you must be particularly
attentive to Mr. Williams this evening.

66
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:24,579
I want his visit here to be first
class in every way.

67
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,943
Yeah, Niles, stay on your toes.

68
00:05:27,136 --> 00:05:28,485
Ohhhh!

69
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:31,420
Oh, my toes.

70
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:35,571
Ah, there you are, Miss Fine.
Now guess what.

71
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:39,041
After dinner I've chartered a boat
to take us around Manhattan

72
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,589
with a Cajun blues band
I've flew in from New Orleans.

73
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:47,347
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
now you're showing some gumbos.

74
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:49,924
Oh, he's here.

75
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:52,176
Nanny Fine, take a powder.

76
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:55,068
Now, now, now, Cee Cee,
if it weren't for Miss Fine,

77
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:58,053
we wouldn't be entertaining
a Pulitzer Prize winner here this evening.

78
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:01,944
Pulitzer Clearing House?
How much did he win?

79
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:04,728
Miss Fine, take a powder.

80
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,246
Mr. Dakota Williams.

81
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:11,419
Ah, I'm just Dak to you all.

82
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,619
Welcome.
/ I do not stand on ceremony,

83
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:18,037
and just to prove it,
I'll drink anything you got.

84
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:21,502
As long as it's sour mash whiskey.
/ Oh, we got that, all right.

85
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:25,199
Don't we, Niles?
/ What are you nuts? Sir ...

86
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:28,201
I'm Cee Cee Babcock, Mr. Williams.

87
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:33,458
Your plays are so profound.
Where do you get your inspiration?

88
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:38,184
Give me an uptight alcoholic spinster,
and I'll give you a play.

89
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:40,336
Ta-ta.

90
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:42,659
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

91
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:45,634
Oh ... Sugar, sugar, sugar,

92
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:48,760
little darling, who are you?

93
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,918
Hi, I'm Fran Fine.

94
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,579
You know, I was the lead in one
of your plays in high school.

95
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,889
Because of my accent, everyone
thought I was from the south.

96
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:00,622
Must have been an amazing production.

97
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:03,639
Oh, when I played
the death scene with my mamie,

98
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,801
how I loved her, how I loved her ...

99
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:11,270
Anyway, there wasn't
a dry eye in Flushing.

100
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,442
Flushing? Like a toilet?

101
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,305
On a good day.

102
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,606
Oh, Sheffield, this is
one saucy woman.

103
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:25,674
We're going to get along like two June bugs
on a summer picnic. Yeah.

104
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:29,072
Well, actually, actually,
she's not your date. / No.

105
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:30,066
Huh?

106
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,813
Your date's even cruder.

107
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,336
Yes, much.

108
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,415
I'll get that.
/ Me too.

109
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:41,546
Oh, Miss Fine, I can taste victory
already. And it's all you.

110
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:43,773
I have you to thank. / You ain't seen nothing yet.

111
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:48,367
Wait till you get a load of the chick
I fixed him up with. Ta-ta!

112
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:56,220
I'm sorry I'm late.

113
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,312
I had to dig up a brassiere
that hooks in the front.

114
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:05,997
What? No good?

115
00:08:10,808 --> 00:08:14,185
Are you out of your bloody mind?

116
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,896
Oh, look who's here, Bob's Big Boy.

117
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:22,669
Miss Fine you fixed up America's
foremost living playwright

118
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:28,313
with a woman whose greatest attribute is
making rice that doesn't stick together?

119
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,806
He was smiling when he met her.

120
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:34,460
He's drunk out of his mind.
/ All right. She's on pain killers.

121
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,891
Maybe neither of them will
realize they're together.

122
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:41,932
Miss Fine, Miss Fine, haven't I been
good to you? / Yes, you have.

123
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:44,575
Gave you a job when you needed one?
/ Yes, you did.

124
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:47,978
All the Slim Fast bars you can eat?
/ Uh-huh.

125
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:53,432
And how do you repay me?
/ I was just trying to be the woman behind the man.

126
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:57,588
How would you like to be the woman
behind the Burger King counter?

127
00:08:57,588 --> 00:09:01,199
The one on 57th Street is hiring.

128
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:04,121
You know, for a minute
there when I saw Yetta,

129
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:09,396
I thought that she was Dakota's date.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

130
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,241
Oh, let me tell her in lieu of
a Christmas bonus.

131
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,634
No!

132
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:22,075
Oh, it's your fault.
Maxwell, let's kill her.

133
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:26,208
Cee Cee, I prefer to do
this without any witnesses.

134
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:28,093
Niles ... / Oh, huh.

135
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:32,862
Mr. Sheffield, let me just
tell you my thinking.

136
00:09:32,862 --> 00:09:40,475
Andrew Lloyd Webber would have never thought
to fix him up with someone like Grandma Yetta.

137
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:47,933
Well, Nanny Fine finally dug a hole deep enough
to bury her and her hair. Ha, ha.

138
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,771
Oh, Miss Babcock, you have
a little something, ah ...

139
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,563
Oh, well, give me that.

140
00:09:55,849 --> 00:10:01,391
How's that? How do I look?

141
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:03,649
Yummy.

142
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:08,348
All right. Would you keep it down.
We've got company.

143
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,009
Cee Cee?
/ What?

144
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,554
What on earth
happened to your face?

145
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:19,759
She cut herself shaving.

146
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:22,192
Oh ...

147
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:33,295
So, anyway, 30 years I'm thinking
it's a beauty mark.

148
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:38,481
Suddenly I wake up, it's
the size of Danny DeVito.

149
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:39,936
Yetta. / Yetta ...

150
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:46,978
That's nothing. I got something that looks like
a gas cap off a '64 Corvair growing on my butt.

151
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:50,325
We believe you. We believe you.

152
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:55,508
Oh, I got something for you.

153
00:10:55,508 --> 00:10:59,253
But first I gotta take off my girdle.

154
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:04,443
You little tease.
You're such a turn-on.

155
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:09,255
Did you hear that? Yetta, big turn-on.

156
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,028
Excuse me, Mr. Williams.

157
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:16,183
I know we could all go on and on
about Yetta. Hell, she turns me on.

158
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:22,872
But why don't we see if we can't work out
a deal before you're sober
— supper — your supper.

159
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:28,014
Sheffield, is this how you do business?
Aha, just show me where to sign.

160
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:31,405
Come on, honeysuckle.

161
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:36,364
It's all body language.

162
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:39,523
Watch the walk.

163
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:48,712
Miss Fine, you never
cease to amaze me.

164
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:51,617
Well, I don't know why you're so shocked.

165
00:11:51,617 --> 00:11:54,701
I mean, you asked me to fix
the man up with someone.

166
00:11:54,701 --> 00:12:00,460
I followed my instincts.
Simple, yet bonus worthy.

167
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,840
Miss Fine, I could just kiss you.

168
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:10,302
Coulda, shoulda, woulda, but didn't.

169
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:19,682
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

170
00:12:19,682 --> 00:12:23,346
Oh, he keeps calling me
his right arm.

171
00:12:23,346 --> 00:12:27,125
Miss Fine, you have more
lives than Garfield.

172
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,241
Oh, Niles, lox, eggs, and onions.
/ Yes.

173
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:35,038
Grandma Yetta left her breakfast order
on the door nob before she went to bed.

174
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:38,936
Well, when she sleeps over, she always
thinks she's at the Fountain Blu.

175
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:44,384
If you want to make a buck, tie your shirt
into a calypso knot and serve her a pina colada.

176
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:49,285
Oh, Miss Fine ...
/ Coming.

177
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:53,558
I'm feeling a little short time
to get on my pedestal.

178
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:57,111
Oh, there she is.
/ Who?

179
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,129
My right arm.

180
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:03,292
Oh, stop it.
You're embarrassing me.

181
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:06,100
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Fine.
I just can't help it.

182
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,618
I own Dakota Williams' next play.
/ Oh ...

183
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:12,101
I finally beat Andrew Lloyd Webber,

184
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,477
and it wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you.

185
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:19,099
Oh, you did it all yourself.
I was merely your, um, um ...

186
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,081
Right arm.

187
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:24,997
Stop it. You're em — oh, it's you.

188
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:27,782
Good morning.
/ Good morning.

189
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:28,670
Good morning.

190
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:31,280
I'll have some of everything.

191
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:35,471
I'm on the American plan.

192
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:40,395
So, tell me, did the dinner last night
go well? You got home so late.

193
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:43,353
Oh, she was quite the little vixen.

194
00:13:43,353 --> 00:13:48,267
Oh, Yetta, you didn't drop anything under
the table and go look for it, did you?

195
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:52,621
One time. Just to see if I still had it.

196
00:13:56,216 --> 00:14:00,168
Good God, that was you?

197
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,527
That was you?

198
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:12,001
Do you two want to be alone?

199
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:19,371
Meanwhile, Dak and I are
a match made in heaven.

200
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:22,388
I like dark meat; he likes light.

201
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:26,353
I could hear the movie;
he could see it.

202
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:30,718
I got a right lung; he's got a left.

203
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:34,419
But the best part is he's retired.

204
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:38,616
No, no, he's not retired yet, Yetta.
He's still got a play to finish.

205
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:43,009
Good luck. The man hasn't
written a word in 20 years.

206
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:47,630
Oh, Yetta, you're confused.
Mr. Sheffield just bought his play.

207
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,017
That's right. The first act
is on my desk right now.

208
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:54,300
Did you happen to notice it was
written with a quill pen?

209
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:59,187
What is she saying? / I'm saying
don't hold your breath for the second act.

210
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:05,231
The man's got writer's blockage.
/ Oh, no. Oh, God ...

211
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:12,615
Thank you for introducing us.
Most guys my age are senile.

212
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:17,096
I'll be in the gift shop.

213
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,765
All right. Let's — let's recap.

214
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:24,293
I now own a play that is
totally worthless,

215
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:28,215
and Andrew Webber does not.

216
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:31,285
My right arm is strangely silent.

217
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:33,622
Did it have a stroke?

218
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:35,853
It's thinking.

219
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,231
Try and follow me for a minute here.

220
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:43,798
Why would Dak sign a deal with you when he
could have signed a deal with Andrew Lloyd Webber?

221
00:15:43,798 --> 00:15:47,602
Because my plays are just as good.
/ No, really.

222
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:54,638
It's because of Yetta. You know,
he might back out of the deal if she dumps him.

223
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:59,921
Wait, wait, Miss Fine, Dak is the most
exciting man Yetta's ever met.

224
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:03,099
I mean, what would possibly
make her leave him?

225
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:07,596
Well, she had her eye
on the couch in the lobby.

226
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,150
Yetta ...

227
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,339
I hate when they don't
put prices on things.

228
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:19,689
Honey, where do you start?

229
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:24,326
Look, Yetta, I know you've grown
very fond of Dak, but,

230
00:16:24,326 --> 00:16:28,117
well, you should know he drinks far too much.

231
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:32,825
He swears like a sailor, and, well,
frankly, he's a scoundrel with women.

232
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:38,165
Mr. Sheffield, are you trying
to talk her out of it or into it?

233
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:41,571
Let me handle it. Yetta,
you gotta break up with him.

234
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:45,238
Why? He's cute, and he's loaded.

235
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:50,400
If we got married, some day
it would all be yours.

236
00:16:51,447 --> 00:16:55,142
What are we really doing here?

237
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,291
Oh, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.
I can't do this.

238
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:03,794
I — I can't ask her to give up her
last chance for happiness just so I can
get out of a bloody business deal.

239
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:11,519
Hold it. This was business?
I was just a cheap tawdry sex toy?

240
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:15,868
Why does this always happen to me?

241
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,298
I'm very sorry, Yetta.

242
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:23,772
Hey, I was there.
How could you not use me?

243
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:29,267
Business is important.
I myself am an entremanure.

244
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:35,010
My family's going to
have to stop breeding.

245
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,495
Franny, let me talk to
your husband in private.

246
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:46,199
You want to talk business, here's the deal.

247
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:51,484
I'll give up Dak if you quit
fooling around with the blond.

248
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:54,592
Shame on you.

249
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:58,437
Look what you've got.

250
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:10,831
Mags, lighten up. What's with
the unga-blues-onaputum?

251
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:14,373
Unga what? / Sour pus.

252
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:19,667
You know, it's a face like that that kept
Molly Ringwald from a film career as an adult.

253
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:25,344
Fran, the worst thing has happened.
The computer nerd asked me out.

254
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:29,966
Oh, so he's getting
a little interactive, huh?

255
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:35,038
Fran, I don't want to go out with him.
Ah, he'll wear that hat with those ear flaps.

256
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,659
Honey, let me impart some wisdom on you.

257
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,808
My mother always dressed my father
in leisure suits,

258
00:18:43,808 --> 00:18:49,835
and no one has ever stolen him away.

259
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,552
Fran, you don't understand.

260
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:57,730
My best friend Whitney's going out with
a football player who is so studly.

261
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,315
All right, honey, honey. Let me just
give you the progression here —

262
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,782
star quarterback, pulled groin, beer gut —

263
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:12,116
can I check your oil, please. Huh?

264
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,464
Maxwell, I'm coming in, and
I have terrible news

265
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:22,358
Isn't that redundant?

266
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,831
Cee Cee, nothing can spoil
this perfect day.

267
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:29,834
Just about now Andrew Lloyd Webber
is probably realizing

268
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:34,404
that he owns Dakota Williams'
long-awaited opus named

269
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:39,349
"You Better Like Act One Cause
There Ain't No Act Two."

270
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:46,570
I read, "Dakota Williams' closes a deal
with Andrew Lloyd Webber to produce
his new play — / Uh-huh.

271
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,404
"-- which he finished in one night."

272
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:55,207
Oh, Miss Fine ...

273
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:01,438
Are you doing the hokey-pokey
and you need your right-arm man?

274
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:06,550
I'd take it out before he shakes
it all about.

275
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,574
Huh?

276
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:09,924
Webber stole our playwright.

277
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:15,463
Well, tell us something
we don't know. Ha, ha, ha.

278
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,505
All right.

279
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:28,617
"The playwright was inspired to complete
the deeply personal project by a recent
bout of unrequited love.

280
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:35,043
In contrast to his usual heroine,
the pivotal character

281
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:42,805
is an earthy, elderby,
Hebraic woman named Zetta."

282
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:48,104
Ever since I started working here,
I don't need a treadmill.

283
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:51,565
I have to get Miss Grace.
Mr. Clinton's here.

284
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:56,166
Clinton? The President?
He knows Barbra Streisand.

285
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:59,648
It's so exciting. Who are you?

286
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:02,122
I'm Roger Clinton.

287
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,314
Do you know Streisand?

288
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:15,103
Well, I was at the inauguration,
but I had terrible seats. / Oh ...

289
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:17,822
Miss Fine, you haven't been dismissed.

290
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:19,728
I haven't finished with you yet.

291
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:22,069
Not now, Mr. Sheffield.
We have company.

292
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:25,745
Roger Clinton is here. / Oh ...

293
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:28,671
Ah, why?

294
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:32,478
Well, your daughter wrote
my brother a letter.

295
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:36,454
And he was so touched by it, he asked
me to stop by while I was in town.

296
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:39,877
Where's the President?
/ Honey, honey, he couldn't make it.

297
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:44,795
But his brother came instead.
/ Oh.

298
00:21:45,406 --> 00:21:49,819
Isn't this exciting?
Honey, go get your camera.

299
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:52,923
Why would I want a picture —
/ Go.

300
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,336
Ah, you know, Mr. Clinton,
Miss Fine here is a great admirer

301
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:01,001
and supporter of your entire family.
/ Yes, I am.

302
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,745
Thank you. That's nice to hear.

303
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:06,159
As a matter of fact, you should
send for her in '96. / Oh ...

304
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,459
Yes. She is an inspiration
to have in your corner.

305
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:16,101
Well, I'll tell Bill. You know,
he's always looking for a good right arm.

306
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:21,401
Mr. Sheffield, that was so nice of you.

307
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:26,370
You know, I thought you were
a republican. / I am.

308
00:22:37,328 --> 00:22:39,392
Thank you for my gift.

309
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,315
Well, Yetta,
I just hope you enjoy it.

310
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:48,043
You know, for the club chair,
I would have put out.

311
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:54,880
Well, that's what happens when you
get involved with an entremanure.
