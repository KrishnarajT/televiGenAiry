1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:12,101
Oh, wow, look at
all these memories.

2
00:00:12,399 --> 00:00:14,854
Ma could never throw
anything of mine away.

3
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:18,704
Darling, get all
your crap out of here.

4
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:23,110
I'm converting the storage room
into a den for your father.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,332
Ma, this is a den by you?

6
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:30,585
Why don't you just strap him to the wall
and slap an iron mask on his face?

7
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:35,488
You kids, we're not into that.

8
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:42,717
Oh, look, my old
stewardess costume.

9
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:46,381
For Halloween, I went as Karen Black
from "Airport '75."

10
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,174
"Oh, my God, the pilot's
been sucked out."

11
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:54,575
Oh, wow, these are cool.

12
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:58,405
Oh, my old platforms.

13
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:05,196
Oh, I used to boogie, yoogie, yoogie till
I just couldn't boogie no more.

14
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,868
Ohhhh ... You want?

15
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,143
Sure.

16
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:14,494
Oh, look, your father's first piece.

17
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:17,919
He loved Ringo.

18
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:21,260
Oh, it takes me back.

19
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:25,338
Now, sing,

20
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:28,575
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

21
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:31,615
Ma, look at this.

22
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:35,290
This is my win a date
with Erik Estrada entry form.

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,450
You were supposed
to mail this in 1979.

24
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,971
All right.
Give it to me.

25
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:45,419
I've got a tax form from
'81 that's gotta go.

26
00:01:45,727 --> 00:01:48,546
Fran, how come all
these kids are green?

27
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:52,189
Oy, my camp picture got moldy.

28
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:56,304
Oh, please, let this be a fat year.

29
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:59,375
Oh, what difference does it make,
that stupid Judy Silverman

30
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,849
always jumped in front of me
every time I went to take a picture.

31
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,783
She was so threatened by me.

32
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:07,770
Why? Because you were
prettier than her?

33
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,315
Well, yeah, that, and also because
I actually threatened her.

34
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:15,428
She always had to be
one up on me, you know.

35
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:17,790
I mean, sometimes she succeeded,

36
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,428
sometimes an ex-lax in hot cocoa
kept her out of cold water.

37
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:27,879
Yow, this is scary. Look, it's a naked picture
of that guy from "Evening Shade."

38
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,388
Oh,

39
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:32,203
gross.

40
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:36,186
Oh, my Burt Reynolds'
"Cosmo" centerfold.

41
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:39,367
Darling, that's mine.
/ No, Ma, you laminated yours.

42
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,246
Okay, Fran, where do you want these?

43
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:42,004
Oh, my old school books.

44
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:46,452
"Looking for Mr. Goodbar,"
"Valley of the Dolls,"

45
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:50,578
"Intro to Chemistry"?
How'd that get in there?

46
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:54,711
What exactly are a person's loins and
how do you get them to quiver?

47
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:57,718
Give me that.

48
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:00,378
You know what?
Stick this in my closet.

49
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:03,495
Better yet, put it under my bed.

50
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:11,680
Oh, Niles, look at what I brought home.
Doesn't it smell real?

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,564
You mean it's not?

52
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:18,091
No. You know what the secret is.

53
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,645
You dust it with Lemon Pledge.

54
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:25,763
Why don't you take it and put it in
your room. Cheer it up a little bit.

55
00:04:25,763 --> 00:04:28,721
Oh, that's really nice.

56
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:32,747
Meanwhile, what are you wearing to
the Camp Kindervelt reunion?

57
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:34,688
Oh, I'm not going to that.

58
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:41,703
I don't need Judy Silverman rubbing her gorgeous,
successful, handsome, rich husband in my face.

59
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:43,512
Maybe she's still single?

60
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:47,220
Oh, Val. You're confusing
her with us.

61
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,928
Judy was already narrowing
the groom side to thirty

62
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:55,922
while we were still bobbing in
the lake shouting "Marko, Polo."

63
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,423
So you're not going to go?

64
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:03,772
Not unless I can go on the arm of
a drop-dead, gorgeous guy.

65
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:08,413
Hello. Tell Georgio I love his suits
but I am not posing for "GQ."

66
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:11,009
I'm a businessman,
not a bloody model.

67
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,402
Wouldn't hurt if he was loaded either.

68
00:05:13,402 --> 00:05:17,014
And what would I do with
another Lamborghini?

69
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,067
Hey, why don't you ask
Mr. Sheffield to take you?

70
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,149
Oh, Val, where do you come up
with these ideas?

71
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:27,001
Why not? It's just a favor.
He's a friend, and you'd do for him.

72
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:32,301
You know, you're right. He's always
schlepping me to those premieres.

73
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:39,828
I'm in and out of those limos. I have to
remember all those names â€” Donald, Marla ...

74
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,653
Woody, Mia. I had to write
Soon-yi's name on my wrist.

75
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:50,610
Fran, these shoes fit great.
/ Oh, good, honey, I'm glad.

76
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,145
Gee, I love those platforms.
I wonder why I stopped wearing them?

77
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:01,277
I'm okay!

78
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:07,855
Maxwell, it's freezing out here.

79
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:11,449
Quit smoking, Cee Cee, and
you can come inside ...

80
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,241
Niles, get that hideous thing
off the terrace, would you?

81
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:30,775
Mr. Sheffield wants you to
get off the terrace.

82
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:38,539
Oh, Maxwell, why can't
I smoke inside?

83
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,566
Cee Cee, if you want to ruin your
own health, that's your own business,

84
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:45,133
but Niles is allergic.
/ Oh.

85
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:54,281
Hi, Mr. Sheffield.
/ What do you want?

86
00:06:54,677 --> 00:07:00,212
Nothing. Can't a friend come in
and say hello to another friend?

87
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,898
Hello, friend.

88
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,826
You're sitting on John Malcovich.

89
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,933
I don't hear him complaining.

90
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:13,646
Get up.

91
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:16,990
Now I forgot what I came
in here to ask you.

92
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,450
Oh, yeah, ah, my camp is having
a big reunion this weekend.

93
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,385
What are you doing Friday night?

94
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:28,661
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday,
Friday, Friday, Friday. Oh,

95
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:33,315
meeting of the Tony committee, what a shame.
Blast, if it was any other night.

96
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:37,681
Oh, lucky you, it's really Saturday.

97
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:43,640
A blind man in New Jersey saw
that one coming, sir.

98
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,756
Miss Fine, I hate reunions.
I didn't even go to my own at Eaton.

99
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:49,928
Oh, yes, you did, sir.
Don't you remember?

100
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,657
You were sulking in the corner because
everyone was kissing Jeremy Irons' ass...

101
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:57,413
perin, Q-Tips, and Chapstick. Well,

102
00:07:57,413 --> 00:08:00,415
I'm off to the drug store.

103
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:05,787
Come on, Mr. Sheffield,
what do you say? / Good-bye?

104
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:10,821
Oh, I can't believe this. After
all the favors that I've done for you.

105
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:14,289
You schlepp me on that yacht
on a Sunday yet,

106
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,823
all the way up to Newport just so you and
the kids can hang out with Clous,

107
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:24,836
meanwhile I'm upstairs with Sunny,
the woman doesn't say two words ...

108
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:35,649
Oh, can you believe I actually considered
calling my ex-fiance Danny

109
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:38,270
to see if he'd take me
to this reunion?

110
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:47,042
Oh, how low can I stoop?
What are you doing Saturday night?

111
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:54,570
As cute a couple as we'd make,
I have a date with a sure thing.

112
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:58,524
Just don't leave your
wallet on the dresser.

113
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:03,174
Fran, I hung your psychopathic
poster in my room.

114
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,179
That's psychedelic, honey.

115
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:11,287
Yeah, Niles, in the old days,
you could hallucinate a date.

116
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:16,649
Oh, God, Andrew Lloyd Webber's
done it again.

117
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:19,338
Just got the rights to a show
I've been after for years.

118
00:09:19,338 --> 00:09:22,170
You know, just for once,
Niles, I'd love to top him.

119
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,586
Well, now, you know how Miss Fine
feels about Judy Silverman.

120
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:29,889
I'm sorry, sir. I know it hurts,
but it's my job.

121
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:36,743
Oh, all right, I suppose it would be very
thrilling for her to walk in with me.

122
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:39,434
Your blue shirt is back
from the cleaners.

123
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:44,419
Oh, no, Niles that's much too here I am,
Mr. Big Famous Producer.

124
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:48,847
I think the, the green tweed, that's
very smart. / Good choice, sir.

125
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:52,402
Oh, you know, there's no time to take it
to the cleaners. You'll have to press it yourself.

126
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:55,115
Oh, fix the lining in the right sleeve,
would you, oh,

127
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:58,823
and mend the buttons.
Just snazz it up a bit.

128
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:01,981
Did you say the green
tweed, sir?

129
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,473
Don't you think it makes
you look rather â€”

130
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:07,846
Rather what?
/ Toughie.

131
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:13,588
Nice try, Niles. I'm wearing
the green tweed. Go on. Get on it.

132
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:17,446
Niles doesn't have anything else to do.
He can go upstairs and snazz it up.

133
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,109
Oh, how do you keep from twisting
your ankle in those things?

134
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:27,852
Oh, you don't. That's what bell
bottoms were for, to hide the swelling.

135
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,561
What's this for?
/ Oh, that's my disco whistle.

136
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:36,813
Twirl that chandelier.

137
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:41,321
I'm looking for some hot stuff,
baby, this evening.

138
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:44,795
Woop. Woop. Hot stuff,
baby, tonight.

139
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:47,491
I'm looking for some hot stuff ...

140
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:50,792
Fran?

141
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,593
I'll get it.

142
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:01,206
Hi / Hi.

143
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:09,601
I'm looking for a Fran Fine.

144
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,805
Oh, hi, Ponch.

145
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,150
Ponch? Whoa!

146
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,107
Oh, my.

147
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,442
You are muy bonita. / Gracias.

148
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:35,463
Wow! Great smile. / Oh, don't look
at it directly. It's like an eclipse.

149
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:39,128
So, are you here to see Mr. Sheffield?
/ No, Fran. He's here to see you.

150
00:11:39,128 --> 00:11:42,404
We sent him your old "win a date
with Erik Estrada" entry form.

151
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:46,065
My manager thought it would be a fun thing
to do, you know, for publicity.

152
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:49,928
Don't you have a big reunion
tomorrow night? / Yeah.

153
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:54,833
Well, I'm the hombre who's taking you.

154
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:59,056
Oh, my God. This is... amazing.

155
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:01,998
It's like a dream.
How could this be?

156
00:12:01,998 --> 00:12:05,541
We told him how desperate you were.

157
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,912
Oh, thank you.

158
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:14,897
Well, then, I'll see you
tomorrow night. / Okay.

159
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:20,290
Oh, by the way, is it formal? / Oh, Erik,
whatever you wear will be just fine.

160
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,220
You wouldn't happen to have your old Chips
uniform â€” oh, no, that would be a push.

161
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,814
That would be a push. Adios.

162
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:30,915
Hasta spumonte, baby.

163
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:37,524
Oh, is he caliente or what?

164
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:42,496
Oh, thank you, guys. You're wonderful.
I love you. I've gotta go call Val.

165
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:49,032
Hold onto your hat, Miss Fine. I've decided
I will escort you to your reunion.

166
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:53,279
Val, sit. You are not going to believe
who's taking me to the reunion.

167
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,710
Judy Silverman will die.
/ Well, she may be a little impressed.

168
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:05,783
Well, he's gorgeous; he's foreign, and he's got
a head of hair that you can lose a hand in.

169
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,040
Well ...

170
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,648
I'm going with Erik Estrada.
/ Who?

171
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:17,869
No, Val, this is not like the time that I said
I was going out with Jan Michael Vincent. Bye.

172
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,591
Oh, hi, Mr. Sheffield.

173
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,999
I see you're wearing
a green tweed jacket.

174
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,415
Yes. Why?

175
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:27,213
Oh, just makes you look a little ...

176
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,345
tubby.

177
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,704
Um, Niles, what's the occasion?

178
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:50,227
It's for you. Congratulations
on quitting smoking.

179
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:54,494
Oh, Niles, you know, when you quit smoking,
you have to be very careful not to gain weight.

180
00:13:54,494 --> 00:13:57,453
Oh, really?

181
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:03,461
Last time I quit, I gained 25 pounds.

182
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,877
Eclairs are ready.

183
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:11,397
Oh, only six more hours
to Erik Estrada.

184
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:13,319
Mr. Sheffield wants to see you.

185
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:17,028
Oh, well, that can only mean one thing,
I'll take the back stairs.

186
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:21,830
Miss Fine ...
/ What have you got me low-jacked?

187
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:29,628
We have a problem.

188
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,900
Why do you always go straight to me?
Niles could have done it.

189
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,926
Yep, Niles is no angel.

190
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,404
Brighten's English teacher
FAXed this over.

191
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:46,920
The assignment was to write from
personal experience. Read it.

192
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:51,863
"Isabell, how do I describe Isabell?

193
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:55,903
She was part woman, part little girl?

194
00:14:55,903 --> 00:15:00,030
I felt her heaving bossom in my â€”" oy.

195
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:04,550
Well, what are you looking at me for?
The only Isabell I know is Sanford.

196
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,708
And if Brighten is fantasizing about Weezie,
this problem is bigger than both of us.

197
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:12,166
I have to get back to work.

198
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,767
See this is rewritten by Monday,
would you, Miss Fine?

199
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:23,976
Oh, but I don't feel like doing
homework on the weekend.

200
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,954
You-who, Miss Babcock,

201
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:30,107
tea time.

202
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,480
Doesn't this Ponch character do anything
on this show but ride a motorcycle?

203
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,491
Well, there does seem to be a crime wave
involving big-busted women in halter
tops driving corvettes.

204
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:52,171
This is absurd. There are more closeups of
his rear end than of his partner's face.

205
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,815
That's the way
I would have directed it.

206
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:05,238
Stop it, Cee Cee, you've been driving
me crazy all week. Now smoke.

207
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:08,540
Maxwell, I am wearing the patch.

208
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,915
If I light a cigarette right now,
my heart will stop.

209
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,210
Oh, I can't even breathe.

210
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,122
I can't believe this. My hair came
out too big. My dress is too small.

211
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:35,805
Really? I think it's a little subdued.
/ Ohhhh.

212
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:39,038
I'd go up another inch or two.

213
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,251
Oh, Dad, you see his Harley?
It's so cool.

214
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:47,619
It's like the beginning of the wild one.
/ What are they so excited about?

215
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:50,259
I rode a motorcycle too,
remember, at Eaton?

216
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,457
I believe that was a mo-ped, sir,

217
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:57,133
with a grocery basket on the front.

218
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,959
Well, it was bloody
good on the curves.

219
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:04,010
Wow, Fran.
/ Hi, Erik.

220
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,814
You look great.

221
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:10,316
That dress is almost as tight
as my "Chips" uniform.

222
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:14,694
Buenos nachos.

223
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,052
I'd like you to meet my mother
from Frito-Lay,

224
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:27,452
and this is my boss Maxwell Sheffield,
the big famous producer.

225
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:31,212
Miss Fine, I'm sure he knows
who I am. / No.

226
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:36,508
What TV shows have you done?
/ None. I produce theater.

227
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:39,191
So how'd you get the house?

228
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:50,523
You know, mosquitos aren't so bad.

229
00:17:50,523 --> 00:17:54,284
Tastes like chicken. / Hi, Fran.

230
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:59,882
Attention all campers,
look who I've got.

231
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:08,416
Fran, it's really Erik Estrada.
I'm dying. MOh ...

232
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,148
You look gorgeous. / Oh, thanks.

233
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,460
Take off the helmet. / No.

234
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,879
Fran, you can't wear a helmet
all night.

235
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:22,525
Why? Madonna wears two traffic
cones strapped on her chest.

236
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:24,866
Fran ...

237
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,295
Oh, all right.

238
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:32,785
Did I deflate? I gotta see.

239
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:41,402
Well, Fran, seems your friends
got a big kick out of this,

240
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:44,790
but I gotta split. It was great
meeting you, though.

241
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,887
Wait a minute. Where are you going?
Judy Silverman hasn't even shown up yet.

242
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:52,100
I'm taking my wife and kids to see
"Beauty and the Beast."

243
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,143
Didn't they tell you?
/ I never met your wife and kids.

244
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:59,577
I meant my manager. You know,
this was all publicity.

245
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:03,313
Oh, right, of course.

246
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:10,880
Well, it was nice meeting you, and thank you
for coming, and enjoy the show.

247
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:17,330
Bye-bye. Adios. I like
the blond guy better.

248
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:24,089
Come on, Val, let's get out of here before
that stupid Judy Silverman ... Hi ...

249
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,126
Fran ...
/ Judy ...

250
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:37,595
So, you here alone?
/ Me, alone? Yeah, right.

251
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:43,555
Uh-huh. Wait right here.
You gotta meet my fiance.

252
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:47,129
Great. I won't budge.
Let's get the hell out of here.

253
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:50,974
All right. Don't run off, now.
I want to meet your guy too.

254
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:53,684
Oh, Val, here's a twenty.

255
00:19:53,684 --> 00:19:56,708
Give it to the janitor. Tell him
to run a comb through his hair.

256
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,516
Too late. Here they come.

257
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:02,604
This is Fran.
/ Hi.

258
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:04,791
Hi. Nice to meet you.

259
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,377
So, where's your guy?

260
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:10,860
My guy? My guy?

261
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,024
We're talking about my guy.

262
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:16,967
Well, to tell you the truth, Judy ...

263
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,363
Hello, darling.
/ Huh?

264
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:21,070
You're her date?

265
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,488
Well, I'm not sure that date
would be the right word.

266
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:28,111
We've been living together
for what, over a year now.

267
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:30,173
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

268
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:34,470
Yeah, did you remember to turn
the alarm on, honey.

269
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,696
The mansion next door to ours
was robbed. It was so scary.

270
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,694
Well, this is Blake Glickman, my fiance.
We're very much in love.

271
00:20:44,936 --> 00:20:46,673
Well, pleased to meet you.
Maxwell Sheffield.

272
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:50,538
How do you do â€” Maxwell Sheffield?

273
00:20:50,968 --> 00:20:53,154
I was in one of your revivals,

274
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:56,647
"76 trombones led the big parade,

275
00:20:56,647 --> 00:21:00,957
with a 110 Coronets
Close At Hand."

276
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,410
That's where I met Kent.

277
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:09,275
That's the last time I feed your
cat when you're on the road.

278
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:15,265
Boy, are their kids going
to be good looking.

279
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:23,700
Miss Fine, what about a little
turn around the dance floor?

280
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,603
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
/ Fran?

281
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:30,824
Val, I'll dance with you later.
I promise.

282
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:40,399
Mr. Sheffield,
what are you doing here?

283
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,759
Well, just after you left,
Mr. Estrada's publicist called

284
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,584
to confirm dinner reservations
for after the show.

285
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:52,240
So I thought maybe you'd have some room
left on your dance card.

286
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,108
Oh, aren't you a doll.

287
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:01,518
You look lovely tonight.

288
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:04,903
Even with the hair?
/ Oh, I like it?

289
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:08,114
You can actually
see over your head.

290
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:16,380
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I'll never forget
that you did this for me tonight.

291
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,994
Well, I know how much
it meant to you.

292
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:29,743
Mr. Sheffield, you are quite
a little dancer there.

293
00:22:29,743 --> 00:22:32,467
Everyone's staring at us.

294
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:37,354
What do you say we give them
an eyefull, huh? / Okay.

295
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:13,462
Oh, I remember when I had to
get rid of my stuff

296
00:23:13,462 --> 00:23:15,852
when they turned my room into a den.

297
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,901
Val, you're still living at home.
/ I know,

298
00:23:18,901 --> 00:23:24,072
you'd think they'd wake me so I could
get off the pool table before they break.

299
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:29,044
Thank God they installed a wet bar.
At least you can shower.
