1
00:00:00,403 --> 00:00:04,250
Oh, my God, will you look at that.

2
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:10,480
Downloaded From www.AllSubs.org

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,526
What is that?

4
00:00:06,526 --> 00:00:10,969
Oh, no. Fran's giving her mother's
canasta group a tour of the house.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,766
Cover your cheeks!

6
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:21,651
And this is the very piano once played
by Mr. Marvin "The Way We Were" Hamlish.

7
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:27,920
Don't push, Frida. Ever since they took
you off of the estrogen you're so aggressive,

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,578
not to mention that five o'clock shadow.

9
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:38,177
Sorry. My girl doesn't do windows.
I thought I'd show her it's not such a sin.

10
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:44,244
Meet me in the kitchen, and
I'll clean behind the refrigerator.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,373
And this is the famous
Sheffield guest bathroom.

12
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:55,613
I don't want to drop names, but Liz Taylor
did not leave "White Diamonds" in there.

13
00:00:55,613 --> 00:01:02,319
Celebrities coming, going, I don't know
how my Fran stays so down-to-earth.

14
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:07,338
Ha, ha. Oh, Ma, please, people are people.
We're all the same under the eyes of...

15
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:12,091
Ben Vereen! Oh, my God!

16
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:23,685
Do "Roots." Do "Roots."

17
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:26,182
And who are these lovely ladies?
/ Oh, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:30,067
Ben, this is my nanny, her mother,

19
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:35,197
and the 1948 Israeli luge team?

20
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:38,549
Do "Pippin." Do "Pippin."

21
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:40,320
Miss Fine, please.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,751
Oh, so I guess a highlight of "Ten Speed and
Brown Shoe" would be out of the question?

23
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:48,901
So you're the one who saw that.

24
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:54,344
Nanny Fine, come on.
Mr. Vereen is a very busy man.

25
00:01:54,344 --> 00:01:56,767
Coming through, coming through.

26
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:59,992
Now can I give you
a lift back to the hotel?

27
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:03,702
He can ride in the basket with Toto.

28
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,989
Ben, Ben, this show has been
a passion of mine for 20 years.

29
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:11,558
And now with you, we have
a sure fire hit on our hands.

30
00:02:11,558 --> 00:02:14,336
I hope I still have the moves.

31
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:20,202
Bravo, bravo, / â™ª

32
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:24,053
I love you. I love you.

33
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:29,466
Well, you see, people are people.
He touched that, it's mine.

34
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:33,300
Yes, I can't believe this play
is finally happening.

35
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,793
Now if we can just get
the financing in place.

36
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:38,138
Fran, come here.
/ What, Ma?

37
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:42,570
We want to invest or canasta winnings
in Mr. Sheffield's play.

38
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,814
Your pishki?
/ Yeah.

39
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:49,270
Oh, Ma, don't be too fast and
loose with your pishki. / What?

40
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,194
It hasn't been touched in years.
/ All right.

41
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:56,132
Mr. Sheffield, they want
to give you their pishki.

42
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:59,781
Oh, well, she seems like
a lovely woman, but...

43
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,346
No, this is Frida.

44
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:03,924
The pishki are their winnings
from playing cards.

45
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:06,508
Oh, goody, we're made.

46
00:03:06,508 --> 00:03:11,877
Um, what my partner means to say is,
though we appreciate your enthusiasm
for the theater, ladies,

47
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:15,442
we cannot possibly accept your...
/ $25,000?

48
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,079
You're in.

49
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:12,945
Niles, that's the spread you're putting out
for Mr. Sheffield's big investor?

50
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:14,745
My mother's got money in this show.

51
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:20,290
I want him walking out with his pants spread
and an Alka-Seltzer foaming out of his mouth.

52
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,049
Miss Fine, this is Beluga caviar,
$100 an ounce.

53
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:28,119
Niles, shopping tip, lump fish, Price Club,
a dollar ninety-nine.

54
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:30,931
It can fill up your whole bathtub.

55
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:34,669
All right, Niles. Charles Haist
will be here any minute.

56
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:38,151
What? Is this all you're serving?
/ Told you so.

57
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:40,281
Niles, I want everything to be perfect.

58
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,852
I've been wanting to do this play since
the beginning of my career,

59
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:46,505
and now finally Cee Cee has found
an investor that shares my vision.

60
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:49,978
Oh, what does he do?
/ He's a garbage man.

61
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,048
But a very wealthy
and acclaimed one.

62
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:55,473
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, look at you. You seem
like a virgin on your wedding night,

63
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:58,060
not that I would know.

64
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,613
Ah, because I've never been married.

65
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:03,165
Where the devil is Cee Cee?
/ Well, it is raining outside, sir.

66
00:05:03,165 --> 00:05:06,126
Perhaps she melted.

67
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:10,629
Shall I see if there's a pointy hat
and Chanel suit lying in the street?

68
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:14,001
Well, let's just hope
my trashman comes through,

69
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:16,419
or we'll lose the theater,
lose Ben Vereen,

70
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,528
and it could be 20 years before
the pieces come together again.

71
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,112
Well, then, what would happen
to my mother's pishki?

72
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:24,079
Oh, well, surely, Miss Fine,
your mother realizes

73
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,866
that investing in the theater
is a risky business.

74
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:33,296
You're talking about a woman whose idea of
risk is wearing white pants to Tony Roma's.

75
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:39,389
Besides, she's already decided how to spend
the profit. She's going to get her whole face redone.

76
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,247
Oh, Miss Fine, it's a little premature.

77
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,603
Really? I thought
she was long overdue.

78
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:46,867
No, Miss Fine,
it's premature to spend it.

79
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:49,757
I mean you, you never know which
way a play is going to go.

80
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:53,844
Well, I don't like the sound of this at all.
You said it was a sure-fire hit.

81
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:56,551
That's my job, to get investors.

82
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:58,396
Believe me, I've tried
all the other arguments.

83
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:02,823
Why not throw your money down a rat hole;
the theater is dying, all of those.

84
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:06,275
But oddly enough the sure-fire hit
routine is somehow more enticing.

85
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:10,201
Well, how much of your own dough
did you stuff down this turkey?

86
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,127
Well, I never invest
in my own plays.

87
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:16,093
Well, it would be rather like
a doctor operating on himself.

88
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:21,353
Oh, although I got a cousin
who's a urologist... / Yes.

89
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,272
Poor Pee Wee's off the air,
and my cousin's still practicing.

90
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:30,723
Maxwell, is he here yet
because I am hot today.

91
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,243
Some twit of a tourist tried
to cheat me out of a cab.

92
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:38,727
I stunned him with my umbrella
and kneed him right in the big apple.

93
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:42,568
I don't know why some nice guy
hasn't snatched her up.

94
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,407
Oh, my God, my hair.

95
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,418
Look, Cee Cee,
I'm counting on you.

96
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:48,390
Haist fancies himself a bit of
a ladies' man,

97
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,081
so please do what you have to
to make yourself presentable.

98
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:56,244
Shall I open the roof and strap
her to a lightning rod?

99
00:06:58,989 --> 00:07:01,927
No pressure, Miss Babcock, but,
you know, if you don't make this happen,

100
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,409
I know 12 canasta ladies
that are going to come after

101
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:08,271
you like the last piece of pastrami
on a tray full of head cheese.

102
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:11,730
Miss Fine, please.
/ I'm going, I'm going.

103
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:16,064
All right. Let's just hope
Mr. Haist's in a generous mood.

104
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:21,266
I hate show business already.

105
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:27,204
I had a harder time getting here than
I did coming down the birth canal.

106
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,946
Charles Haist, how you doing?

107
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:33,860
Maxwell Sheffield, hello.
What on earth happened to you?

108
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,239
Well, I was just getting into a taxi
when some big blond woman kneed me in the groin,

109
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:43,795
and then she clobbered me
with some hideous green umbrella.

110
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,529
So where's your partner, Cee Cee?

111
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,973
You know she's the best
FAX I ever had.

112
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:56,520
Well, Charlie, what, what do you say
we just keep this between us boys, hey?

113
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,519
Oh, I gave that up in camp, Sheffy.

114
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:03,635
Let me tell you why I'm getting
into show business.

115
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:08,338
I have made zillions in waste management
but you just don't see a lot of leg,

116
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:12,528
and if you do, you're calling homicide.
Ha, ha, ha.

117
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:15,344
What exactly are you saying?

118
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:19,599
What I'm saying, no chick,
no check, no deal.

119
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,656
Maxwell, is he here yet? Ahhhh ...

120
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:30,485
Was that / Ah, that's... oh, you might as well
know, that was my partner, Miss Babcock.

121
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:33,495
All right, come on out, Cee Cee.

122
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:41,656
Oh, no. Do I have a run
in my Hanes?

123
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:47,172
Look, that's not a run;
that's just a little snag.

124
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,857
Have you got some clear polish?
I'll fix it for you.

125
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:52,785
Miss...
/ Babcock, how do you do?

126
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:55,707
What? You know, you sounded
a little different on the phone.

127
00:08:55,707 --> 00:09:00,427
Oh, I switched to MCI.
/ Oh, why?

128
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:04,513
Because I have got
a lot of friends and family.

129
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,824
What's that?

130
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:12,124
The dog. We put her away because
we didn't want her to jump your leg.

131
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:15,143
We really need to have her fixed.

132
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,834
Shall we?

133
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:22,679
Maxwell, Nanny Fine can't
possibly pass for me.

134
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,111
She isn't in my class.

135
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,742
She doesn't have my breeding.

136
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:32,814
Well, then perhaps she won't lick
herself in front of company.

137
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:35,460
Maxwell, are you going to let
him talk to me like that?

138
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,325
Yes.

139
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:40,910
You attacked our investor.
That's bad, Cee Cee, very bad.

140
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,777
Maxwell. / Sit.

141
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:47,495
Is he going to hit her with
a rolled-up newspaper?

142
00:09:47,495 --> 00:09:51,537
All right. We have exactly three minutes
to teach you everything Miss Babcock
knows about the theater.

143
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:54,761
We can do that and make
a two-minute egg.

144
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,536
First, we open in Philadelphia.
/ Oh, Philly, great.

145
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:00,702
My Aunt Selma lives in Philly.
She's the one with the miracle ear.

146
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:05,494
Oh, a bit deaf, hey?
/ No, she has a miracle ear.

147
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:09,992
When you look way inside,
you can see the Virgin Mary.

148
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:13,902
She can't even get her ears pierced
because they keep healing.

149
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:15,852
This is absurd.

150
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:17,665
Miss Fine, please.

151
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:19,122
Miss Babcock.
/ Miss Babcock.

152
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:21,374
What?

153
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,272
You better call me Cee Cee. After all,
we have been partners for over ten years.

154
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:27,746
She's right. There needs to be
a certain level of intimacy.

155
00:10:27,746 --> 00:10:30,136
I've always said that.
/ Sheffield?

156
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:34,309
Get out, get out. Out, out,
/ Maxwell, it's raining.

157
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:42,078
So where'd you guys disappear to?

158
00:10:43,358 --> 00:10:46,792
We had to put the dog out.

159
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:50,253
All right, Sheffield, now I've got
a couple of questions about the play.

160
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:54,597
Now the first...
does she ever wear pants?

161
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:57,509
Cause then I'm out.

162
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:02,829
And, second, where's the play open.
/ Oh, I know that. I know that. I ...

163
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:05,833
Miss Babcock, would you like
some cream cheese?

164
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,228
We open in Kraft.

165
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:12,554
We open in Philly, Miss Fine...
Babcock, fine Miss Babcock.

166
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:15,715
Oh, that she is.
But I'm moving on.

167
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:17,898
Act I is... it's trash.

168
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:20,961
I beg your pardon.
It's a touching, well crafted ...

169
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:26,096
Oh, it's got flies on it, Sheffy.
We need a rock-um sock-um opening number.

170
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:28,427
Yeah, people go to
the theater after dinner.

171
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:32,528
They got gas.
They need a cover.

172
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:36,725
Right. We need a big number so
people can open their candy wrappers.

173
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:39,365
Which they'll then throw
on the floor.

174
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,199
More garbage.

175
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:46,353
Oh, that intermission is going to sound
like Massachusetts in the fall.

176
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:48,974
Now, about that check ...

177
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,888
I'm going to give you that check
tomorrow evening over dinner.

178
00:11:51,888 --> 00:11:54,810
I've made reservations
at the Rainbow Room.

179
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,060
Oh, I love that place.
/ Oh, what a success story.

180
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,327
They must do 20, 30, dumpsters
a night. / No.

181
00:12:01,327 --> 00:12:04,761
Cee Cee, Cee Cee. / I'll pick you up
at 8:00. Where do you live?

182
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:10,008
Well, um, you'd think I live here;
I'm such a freeloader.

183
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:14,694
Perhaps you have a business
card in your purse. / Good.

184
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:16,821
No. Your purse.

185
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:20,254
That's my purse.

186
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,529
It's the rage in Europe.

187
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:32,874
Okay. Let's see. We've got
Retin-A and collagen.

188
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:34,769
Oh, here, what's this?

189
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,674
Oh, the bill from my shrink.
Whoa! Am I unhappy.

190
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,464
407 East 86th Street.
I'll send a limo.

191
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:47,855
Niles, did you forget something?
/ Oh, yes, quite right, sir.

192
00:13:08,196 --> 00:13:12,082
Oh, man, I'll never get this game.
What do you do if you have four queens?

193
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:16,013
Gather around the piano
and sing songs from "Gypsy."

194
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:20,707
Hi, guys.

195
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:23,666
Oh, wow, Fran, you look
so hot in this dress.

196
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,502
Oh, oh. I'm supposed to
look like Miss Babcock.

197
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,568
I tried to dress conservatively.

198
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:33,728
Niles, can you picture
Miss Babcock in this dress?

199
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:37,656
Not if I ever want to
function as a man again.

200
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:41,923
Sorry, Maggie, but three kings
beat four queens.

201
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:46,433
They do? / Brighten, that is
a big fat lie. Didn't I teach you anything?

202
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,435
Gee, I don't know,
Cee Cee, did you?

203
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:51,090
Well, that's an entirely
different thing.

204
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,494
I am not lying. I'm just pretending,
like in one of your father's plays.

205
00:13:55,494 --> 00:13:58,253
Oh, so you're pretending
to be an actor?

206
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,498
No. You're thinking of Stephen Segal.

207
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:05,896
Besides, why aren't you playing hide
and seek with your sister Gracie?

208
00:14:05,896 --> 00:14:08,903
She's been up in the hamper
for three and a half hours.

209
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:11,505
Oh, she'll show. How many days
can she go without food?

210
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:14,577
Well, about as long as you can go
without that "Playboy" magazine

211
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:18,295
that's rolled up inside
your Lincoln logs.

212
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:22,000
Ready or not,
here I come.

213
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:24,382
Okay, Niles, I'm off
to be Miss Babcock.

214
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:27,540
Help me get into character.
Hit me with your best shot.

215
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,209
Oh, no, Miss Fine,
I couldn't possibly.

216
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:33,448
Oh, come on. Hello, hello,
I'm Cee Cee Babcock.

217
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:36,100
Off to go to work.
/ In your usual corner?

218
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,161
Oh, I'm sorry. Miss Fine,
don't make me do this.

219
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:45,520
I'm Miss Babcock, and I'm off
to get money from a man.

220
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,742
Don't forget your change belt.

221
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:53,960
Oh, I hate myself. Do it again.

222
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,561
Now I have to go.
/ Oh, come on, one more, I'm hot.

223
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,246
Oh, all right, and
I'll make this one easy.

224
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:03,679
Niles, get me a drink.
I'm dog tired.

225
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,765
Dog tired?
/ Come on.

226
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:07,380
A drink for the dog.
/ I don't hear anything.

227
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,714
Oh, ah, ah ...
/ Oh, Niles, get a life.

228
00:15:10,714 --> 00:15:13,649
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
I've got, I've got it.

229
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:17,419
I'll leave the lid up
on the toilet bowl ...

230
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:21,748
Officer.

231
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:34,176
Hi.
/ You finally got here.

232
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:37,985
Oh, this is nice. Very warm.

233
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,903
Which way to radiology?

234
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:44,819
Let me guess.
The Heidi Fleiss collection?

235
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:48,733
You told me to wear something designer.

236
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:53,191
All right. I have prepared
a short dossier on myself.

237
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:58,351
where I grew up,
went to prep school,

238
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:01,737
when I came out.
/ You came out?

239
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,857
So what are you always sniffing
around Mr. Sheffield for?

240
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,764
My coming out party, Miss Fine.

241
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:10,206
I know. I heard you.

242
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:15,846
You know, now you and your special friend
can dance together at Disneyland.

243
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,104
Oh, aren't these lovely.

244
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,376
Oh, who are these people
in the picture?

245
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:24,508
That's my brother,
and that's any sister.

246
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:27,934
Wow, isn't he gorgeous.

247
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:31,528
Yeah, he is, isn't he?
/ Come on. Who is he?

248
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:34,719
Just someone; he's not important.
/ Oh, tell me, tell me.

249
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,651
He came with the frame, okay?

250
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:46,723
Oh, honey, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
A lot of grown women do that.

251
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:49,384
So pathetic.

252
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:53,069
All right, now what do I do
if Haist wants something to drink?

253
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:57,409
Oh, I've got gin, vodka, bourbon.

254
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:01,303
You don't have anything
a little softer? / Rum?

255
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:05,990
It's a good thing that I carry
a can of Clamato with me.

256
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,096
Plus if ever you hit a skunk
/ Nanny Fine.

257
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:13,843
Meanwhile, Miss Martha Stewart,
with half a million dollars coming,

258
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:17,356
would it have hurt to squeeze
a little cheese on a Ritz?

259
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:21,652
Please, concentrate.
Who is it?

260
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:25,479
Who do you think it is? Ed McMahan?
Get in the closet.

261
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,950
Charlie, hi.

262
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,520
Hello. / Come on in and take a load off.
That check must be heavy.

263
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,893
So this is your apartment.
/ Uh-huh.

264
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:40,824
Doesn't look like you at all.
/ Ha, ha. Go hire a straight decorator.

265
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,818
For you, Cee Cee.
/ Oh, how lovely.

266
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:49,271
Thank you so much.
Did you bring the half a mil?

267
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:53,041
Cee Cee, I've been thinking.
I don't want to invest that much.

268
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:56,809
You don't?
/ No. I want to double it.

269
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,971
Ohhhhhh ...

270
00:17:59,427 --> 00:18:01,536
Poltergeist.

271
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:05,486
I got the apartment really cheap,
but I can't watch TV.

272
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,092
Are you going to put
those flowers in a vase?

273
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:10,032
Oh, yeah, sure, of course.

274
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,743
If only I could figure out
where I put my vases.

275
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:16,383
Perhaps in the kitchen.
/ Right. In the kitchen. Of course.

276
00:18:17,023 --> 00:18:19,020
That's a linen closet.

277
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:23,773
The maid was here today. She never
puts anything back where it belongs.

278
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:26,954
Now if I were the maid,
where would I put the kitchen?

279
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:28,924
Oh, bingo.

280
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:32,215
Aren't you going to get that?

281
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:37,314
No. It's just my idiot neighbor.
You live in 6-B.

282
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,503
Maxwell, what are you doing here?

283
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:45,327
Cee Cee, I've come to my senses.
This is not how I do business.

284
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:49,727
Are you crazy? He is throwing money at her,
and she didn't even have to put out...

285
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,878
hors d'oeuvres, the cats,
anything really.

286
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:56,922
I don't care how important
this play is to me.

287
00:18:56,922 --> 00:18:59,545
Nothing is worth this.
/ He's up to a million.

288
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:02,137
They're coming.
Get in the closet.

289
00:19:03,078 --> 00:19:06,754
I wouldn't eat that shrimp if you were you.
God knows how long it's been in there.

290
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:09,441
Oh, Cee Cee, I'm an expert on garbage.

291
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,929
This baby's got two or
three hours before it turns.

292
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,002
Want a bite? / No.
As appealing as hepatitis sounds,

293
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:20,790
yellow is just not my color.

294
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,898
Well, let's talk about us.

295
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:27,864
You see, I, I think you
and I see eye-to-eye.

296
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:30,924
Those aren't my eyes.

297
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:38,545
Well, don't you know that little bald middle
age men have very high levels of testosterone?

298
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:42,781
An ironic twist of fate.

299
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:48,633
You see, I say let's dump
Sheffield and make this a duet.

300
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,012
You said on the phone
that you're the brains

301
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:54,263
and he's just a pretty
face in a blazer.

302
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:58,899
I said that?
How dare me.

303
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:04,550
I said you were pretty great
and a trail blazer.

304
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,681
Damn celular phones.

305
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:09,278
Let me tell you something.

306
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:12,371
Maxwell Sheffield is
a man of vision.

307
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:16,475
Sure he passed on "Cats,"
not one of his finest hours,

308
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:21,188
but when everybody was going crazy
wondering where to put the fiddler,

309
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:26,476
he's the one that said,
"Stick him on the roof."

310
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:32,276
What does Sheffield really
have that I don't have?

311
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:36,813
Well, for starters, he doesn't have
a shrimp vein hanging out of his tooth.

312
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:40,302
Mr. Sheffield is
a man of integrity.

313
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:43,171
When he believes in a play
he will stick by it

314
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:46,314
even if it takes him
20 years to mount.

315
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:51,130
Whilst I, Cee Cee Babcock, will
mount just about anything.

316
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:54,983
Oh, there must be a gun in here somewhere.
I'll say she was a burglar.

317
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,184
If you're going to stick with that
no-talent limie loser, then...

318
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:03,374
oh, hey, hi, Sheffield.
/ Oh, she goes in; he comes out.

319
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:06,667
This is like
a David Copperfield special.

320
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,227
Mr. Sheffield,
what are you doing here?

321
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:12,144
Just throwing out the trash.

322
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,057
Don't leave.

323
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:20,292
Do you want to hear
a really funny story?

324
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:23,799
Hello, there.
/ Mr. Sheffield.

325
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,626
You were worried about me so you
were peeking through the key hole?

326
00:21:28,626 --> 00:21:31,722
Oh, how sweet.

327
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:34,913
You don't do that at home, do you?

328
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:43,186
Oh, Niles, my mother's going
to be here any minute.

329
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:47,157
How am I going to tell her that
she doesn't have a pot to pishki in?

330
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:49,423
Just tell her the truth.

331
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:52,538
Oh, right, the truth, of course.
I'm a grown woman.

332
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:55,333
I don't have to be afraid of
my own mother.

333
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,736
Besides, she's slowed down
ever since her thighs met.

334
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:02,579
She wears corduroy slacks.
She could roast a marshmallow.

335
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:05,909
Hi Ma. / Hi.
/ How you doing?

336
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:10,540
Ma, I got something to tell you,
but I'm scared you're going to yell.

337
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,460
Darling, you scared of your mother?
I could just smack you.

338
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:18,229
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

339
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:21,224
Meanwhile, when's the last time
you called your poor mother...

340
00:22:21,224 --> 00:22:27,527
an ocean away in a drafty country
eating French fries from a newspaper?

341
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,398
Mommy, just promise me you're
not going to yell.

342
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:37,952
Why would I yell?

343
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:41,854
Good evening, ladies. / Mr. Sheffield,
I was just going to tell my mother
about her investment.

344
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:44,649
Oh, yes. As a matter of fact,
I have some good news on that front.

345
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:47,737
I found a new investor,
and you are looking at him.

346
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:51,668
Oh, well, I thought that you never
invested in your own plays.

347
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:54,557
Which frankly I always found
to be very fishy.

348
00:22:54,557 --> 00:22:59,524
Well, I hear this one's being produced
by a man of vision and integrity.

349
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:02,029
Oh, Sylvia, you'd have been
very proud of your daughter.

350
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:03,766
Oh, we don't need to
tell her this.

351
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:05,899
She turned down one of the wealthiest
men in the country,

352
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:08,779
and she did it out of loyalty to me.

353
00:23:08,957 --> 00:23:11,450
So that's what you were
afraid to tell me,

354
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,752
that you turned down a millionaire.

355
00:23:13,752 --> 00:23:18,147
Franny, you don't know your
mother very well. / Oh ...

356
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:23,655
Excuse me. Is this oven gas?
