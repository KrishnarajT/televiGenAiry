1
00:00:02,561 --> 00:00:07,483
I'm going to miss you too, sweetie,
but it's the first day of school.

2
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:11,130
They're going back to school, huh.
Going back to school, huh.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,675
Going back to school, huh,
going back to school, huh.

4
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:18,305
Going back to school...
/ Oh, Niles, this sandwich feels a little stale.

5
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:22,329
Well, I made them in June in
anticipation of this blessed event.

6
00:00:23,595 --> 00:00:26,443
Fran? Hey, Fran.
/ Hi, honey. What? What?

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,457
How do I look? / Gorgeous, always.
Oh, wait. Oh, my God.

8
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:33,505
Look how tall you got.
I can hardly reach.

9
00:00:33,505 --> 00:00:35,959
Oh, my God. I got too tall?
What am I going to do?

10
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:40,980
Well, somebody's got to clean
the Statue of Liberty. / Shut up, Brighton.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,020
Honey, you're gorgeous, don't worry.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,191
In high school they stopped
making fun of the tall girls.

13
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:48,196
It's the girls with BO
that's gotta worry.

14
00:00:49,114 --> 00:00:54,653
Sorry I'm late. I was on the phone with
my therapist. I had the unicorn dream again last night.

15
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:57,839
Now, these shrinks, they read
something into everything.

16
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,643
Honey, a unicorn is nothing more
than a big horse with a long...

17
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:05,597
if you need therapy,
I need to be committed.

18
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:08,414
All right, children,
the limo's waiting. Time to go.

19
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:10,852
All right. You heard your father.
/ Scram.

20
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,280
Woops!

21
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:17,130
First day of school already.
Summer just flew by.

22
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,152
Spoken by a man who did not
see the "Lion King" 257 times.

23
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,394
Home alone. No more Pog.

24
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:21,521
No more Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,
and alas, no more Nintendo.

25
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:24,452
What happened to the Nintendo?

26
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:29,084
Well, I accidentally pounded it
repeatedly with a meat mallet.

27
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:33,751
Niles, you couldn't have thought
of that two months ago?

28
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:40,040
Oh, Niles, look, ESQUIRE came out
with their most eligible bachelor list.

29
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,871
Oh, they retired Jon Jon.

30
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:47,685
You know, no offense to Daryl,
but, if you recall,

31
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:50,514
Caroline found happiness
with a Schlossberg.

32
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:54,198
Jackie found happiness
with a Templesman.

33
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:58,136
Maybe Jon Jon should have stopped
by a few Hadassah meetings.

34
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,579
Oh, look, Mr. Sheffield's
moved up to third place.

35
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:05,766
Oh, yeah, oh, say hello
to bachelor No. 3.

36
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,751
Oh, not you too.
/ Why?

37
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:11,081
I've been bombarded all morning
with FAX's and telephone calls

38
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,145
women who want to date me, women
who want to have my children.

39
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:18,631
And this one wants to ...
oh, good God!

40
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,694
I'll follow-up on that one, sir.

41
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,379
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
I think it's an honor.

42
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:31,922
Look, you're right behind Prince Edward
and the former Mayor Cotch.

43
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:34,166
I'll tell you, just my opinion,

44
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:39,039
but if those two ever met,
you could move straight up to No. 1.

45
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,277
I don't want to be No. 1, Miss Fine.

46
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:44,608
I don't want to be
on the damn list at all.

47
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,661
I'm a widower for God sakes,
not a bachelor.

48
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,793
And the difference would be?

49
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:52,991
Well, a bachelor makes you
think of dancing till dawn,

50
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:56,563
champagne for breakfast,
and black satin sheets.

51
00:03:56,563 --> 00:04:01,441
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, too bad
we never met in a past life.

52
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,520
Miss Fine, I'm quite
content with my life.

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,387
I have my family;
I have my work.

54
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:09,571
Well, you know what they say.
All work and no play makes a man ...

55
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:12,350
Rich enough to pay our salaries.
/ All right.

56
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,147
Play time's over.
Make some money. / Yeah.

57
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:17,410
Look, Miss Fine, I appreciate
your concern, I really do,

58
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,423
but I'm just not ready
to date yet. All right.

59
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:24,971
Oh, fine, I didn't bring it up.
I just came in for a fruit.

60
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:31,094
Oh, I'll tell you,
it just makes me so sad.

61
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:36,050
Here it is five years later, and he still
feels like he'd be cheating on his wife.

62
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,788
It's a classic widower syndrome.
/ Very astute, Miss Fine. "Oprah"?

63
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:44,136
"Courtship of Eddie's Father."

64
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,380
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of miss the kids.

65
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,605
Shut up, Brighton.
/ I'm over it.

66
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:55,863
We're home.
/ Hi. How was your first day back?

67
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:58,991
Oh, I love school. They opened
a coffee shop across the street,

68
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,677
and they only hired really
cute college guys.

69
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:05,978
And for this, your father
pays seven grand?

70
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:10,115
Was it directly across
the street or catty-corner.

71
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:16,230
Fran, I love second grade. The conversations
on the monkey bars were so stimulating.

72
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:23,086
Oh... Some of life's best moments are spent
hanging from your knees with your skirt over your head.

73
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:26,644
I hate junior high.
I'm never going back.

74
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:31,035
Oh, now, don't panic.
It's just the first day.

75
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:34,408
Oh, he'll go back.
He will go back, won't he?

76
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,655
Well, if he doesn't,
we'll have to hire a tutor.

77
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:41,836
And then he'll be home
all the time. / Brighton ...

78
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,991
Brighton, honey, you want to
talk about it? / No.

79
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:50,662
Okay ...

80
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:58,962
On the other hand, I think I'd feel too
guilty cashing my paycheck this week.

81
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:03,568
Come on, B, I'm your nanny.
You can talk to me about anything.

82
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:07,491
Except computers, those things
throw me into a tailspin.

83
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:10,120
Never mind. It's too embarrassing.

84
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,046
Honey, you're talking to a woman whose
underpants fell off in the middle of Bloomingdales.

85
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,611
Really? What did you do?

86
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:24,071
I kicked them down to the land
comb counter and kept on walking.

87
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:27,613
Well, there are just some things
a girl wouldn't understand.

88
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:30,923
I'm not a girl.
I'm a nanny.

89
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,874
Anything you say goes
no further than this room.

90
00:06:33,874 --> 00:06:37,714
I'm like a priest.
Well, not exactly a priest

91
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:40,644
because priests are celibate,
and I'm ...

92
00:06:40,644 --> 00:06:43,395
actually, I could be a priest.

93
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:48,597
No, not with that Nehru collar.
I like a nice scooped neck, a "V,"

94
00:06:48,597 --> 00:06:51,548
off the shoulder's nice,
all good for me, but a Nehru, no ...

95
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:55,890
All right, all right,
I'll tell you.

96
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,103
We were in the locker room after gym ...

97
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,017
And?

98
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:04,125
Fran, I'm smaller than everyone else.

99
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,373
Smaller? How?

100
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:09,193
Just forget it.
It's too humiliating.

101
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:14,631
Well, what could be so humiliating
about being smaller in the locker room?

102
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:23,866
Mr. Sheffield, I'm sorry to bother
you, but we've got a problem.

103
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:27,592
And boy, you are never going
to guess this one.

104
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:30,250
Just make it short.
/ You ...

105
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:40,073
You guessed.

106
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:43,325
Niles, do you need to
speak with me as well?

107
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:48,949
Oh, no, sir. I simply wanted to be
here in person for this one.

108
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,257
Brighten was in gym class,
and, well, when he looked around,

109
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:57,391
compared to all the other
boys, he is small.

110
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,219
Small?

111
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:04,053
You know, like in petite...

112
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:07,438
pequito...

113
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,172
Girkin.

114
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:18,189
Oh ...

115
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,512
And the poor guy's really upset.
What are we going to do?

116
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:27,913
Yes. Cee Cee, would you excuse us.
I have to have a word with Miss Fine.

117
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:30,011
If I go, he goes.

118
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,784
Yes, of course. Niles.

119
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:34,152
What did I do?

120
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:36,782
Niles ...

121
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,103
Well, now you've ruined
it for everybody.

122
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,080
So ...
/ So ...

123
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,557
Brighten, huh? Are you sure?
But he has such big feet.

124
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:54,061
I suppose I'll just have to sit him down
and have a man-to-man talk with him.

125
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:58,088
Either that or buy
him a really big car.

126
00:09:00,558 --> 00:09:02,410
Brighten...
/ Yeah, Dad?

127
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,264
I think we should have
a little talk.

128
00:09:05,264 --> 00:09:07,945
I mean not a little talk.

129
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:12,802
Well, it might it might, start out
little, but get big later.

130
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,750
Not that a ... not that a big talk is
necessarily any better than a a little talk.

131
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,215
The size of the talk is
really not important.

132
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:24,351
Any questions so far?

133
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,998
Have you seen my Nintendo?

134
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:34,422
Val, can you put my hair
brush in your purse?

135
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:38,053
I can if you carry my Mace.
/ Put your Mace in your pocket.

136
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:40,037
I got my Totes rain hat in there.

137
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:45,305
Well, if you put on your Totes rain hat,
you're not going to need the Mace.

138
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:51,144
Oh, Val, look at him sitting
there alone like a dog.

139
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:53,538
Yeah, meanwhile, we're going to
miss the No. 5 bus.

140
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:57,796
But how is it possible? I mean
he's handsome; he's young ...

141
00:09:57,796 --> 00:10:02,484
all right, he's 42, but he's
a nice man, a good catch, true?

142
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,599
True.

143
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,812
Ladies, please, I am not
in the cone of silence.

144
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,536
Val, your voice travels.

145
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,744
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, come with us.

146
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:18,559
No, really. It's,
it's very generous of you.

147
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,018
But I, I have a full
evening planned.

148
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:24,322
It will give me a chance
to finish the book.

149
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:27,178
Oh, Webster's, let me
know how it ends.

150
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:29,917
Well, all right, then, I can
spend the evening with ...

151
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,862
Maggie! We'll go to Rufflemeyers and ...

152
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:37,954
have great big sundaes with nuts
and bananas, what do you say?

153
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:41,341
Well, it's kind of
the first day of school.

154
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:45,767
I was going to meet up with some kids
and have some actual fun. / Oh.

155
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:47,031
Bye.

156
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,454
Come on, Mr. Sheffield,
come with us.

157
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:53,826
It's supposed to be
a really great club.

158
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:56,950
No, I already told you,
I'm not ready to date.

159
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,341
What date? We're just
three friends sharing a cab,

160
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:03,095
or in this case, your limo.

161
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:07,159
What does he know from clubs?
/ Excuse me.

162
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,978
Studio 54, Anabells, Tramps,

163
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:12,909
Maxwell Sheffield was there.

164
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:17,639
Oh, you hear that, Val?
He got down, he got funky.

165
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:20,409
Ladies, to the limo.

166
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:22,925
But who's going to hit on us
if we're with a guy?

167
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:24,995
Oh, just let me
take care of that.

168
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:28,420
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
I'm so happy that you're coming.

169
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,638
You're really going to have
a wonderful time.

170
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:35,869
Oh, just one last thing: You don't know us;
we've never seen you before,

171
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:39,187
and I might have to tell
a few people that you're gay.

172
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:52,068
Oh, is this a great club or what?

173
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:55,015
We haven't been inside yet.
/ Oh, we never get inside.

174
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,320
You get inside?

175
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,461
Val ...

176
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:03,008
Oh, Fran, there's a cute guy over
there checking you out.

177
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:05,602
Where? Where?

178
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,544
Oh, he is cute.

179
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:11,468
I think you're losing it.

180
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,128
I wonder why.

181
00:12:15,062 --> 00:12:17,298
Oh, sorry, forgot.

182
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:19,696
Don't even know you.

183
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:22,057
Oh, my God, is that Alec Baldwin?

184
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:24,606
No, I think it's Billy.
Wait, I think it's Daniel.

185
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,838
Oh, it's Steven.

186
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,938
Maxwell Sheffield?

187
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:38,125
Yes.

188
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,363
Please, please, follow me.

189
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:43,882
Oh, my God, we're getting in.
/ And you didn't want to bring him.

190
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:46,690
Excuse me. Are they with you?

191
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,150
No, don't know them.
Never saw them.

192
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,882
Perfect strangers.
/ Mr. Sheffield ...

193
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:56,990
Oh, and I might be gay ...

194
00:13:07,383 --> 00:13:10,309
Want a jelly donut? / Sure, why not?

195
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,404
You know, I'm going to write
those people at Exxon a letter.

196
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:16,230
They do a beautiful restroom.

197
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,288
Whoever cleaned that toilet should be
sent straight to Prince Edward Sound.

198
00:13:24,697 --> 00:13:27,706
Here he is. Mr. Sheffield,
we're over here.

199
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:31,801
Fantastic club. You can't even
move on this dance floor.

200
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,377
So what do the two of you think?

201
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:36,949
It's like nothing we've
ever seen before. / Ever.

202
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:41,213
I met the most incredible woman.
/ Get out of here. You met someone?

203
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:44,078
Yeah. Just, just wait here.
I want you to meet her.

204
00:13:44,305 --> 00:13:45,963
Can you believe he met someone?

205
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:49,305
I'm wearing the Wonder Bra,
and he gets lucky?

206
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:52,024
I wonder who she is.
/ Oh, you know, he's so naive.

207
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:55,136
I just hope he doesn't come
walking out with Rue Paul.

208
00:13:56,239 --> 00:14:00,212
Val, Fran, this is Leslie.

209
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:07,619
Love the coat. Ha, ha, ha.

210
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:14,376
Oh, my God.

211
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,561
He's a sprocket.

212
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,636
Niles, have my chauffeur bring
the limo around, would you?

213
00:14:19,636 --> 00:14:22,015
I'm taking Leslie out to
a gallery opening in Soho,

214
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:25,735
then on to dinner
and dancing at Matches.

215
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:31,340
The man's got a life, and I don't.
It's a world gone mad.

216
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,208
So what is the mystery woman like?
/ Well, she's got a lot of hair.

217
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,384
She wears a lot of makeup
and and very flashy clothes.

218
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:43,019
All in all, I'd say it was
a very attractive package.

219
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,718
Oh, I'll get it.

220
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,137
Niles, you know, you don't have
to keep announcing that.

221
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,321
It's your job. Believe me,
no one's going to horn in on you.

222
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:55,113
Hello.

223
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,892
What?

224
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,643
Nothing, ah ...

225
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:05,594
just stay right here until
I go get Miss Babcock.

226
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:12,390
Mr. Sheffield, Leslie's here.

227
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,776
Take your time.

228
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:17,697
Come on. Come, come, come,
come, come, come, come.

229
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:21,451
Niles, what is so damn important?

230
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:22,646
Hi.

231
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:28,501
Good God, it's multiplying.

232
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:31,439
I'd like you to meet Miss Babcock.

233
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:35,549
This is Mr. Sheffield's
business partner. This is Leslie.

234
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:38,533
I love your hair. Who does your color?

235
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:42,081
Oh, it's natural.

236
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:49,967
Well, I think it's very distasteful
of Maxwell to be dating so soon.

237
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:53,615
Isn't a decade the standard
period of mourning?

238
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:56,398
Die and let's find out.

239
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:01,805
Some house, huh?

240
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:08,281
Boy, when I first came here from Queens,
I never thought that I'd ever have a house this big.

241
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:11,357
Tell me about it. When I left Brooklyn
and became a C.P.A.,

242
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:14,646
wouldn't you know I had (inaudible).

243
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,414
Oh, I hear ya.

244
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:21,543
Niles, would you ice this and put it
in the limo? / Oh, certainly, sir.

245
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:23,379
That's a good man.
/ Oh, excuse me, sir.

246
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,428
If you don't mind my asking,

247
00:16:25,428 --> 00:16:28,713
doesn't Miss Leslie
remind you of someone?

248
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:33,926
Oh, so you noticed it too.
/ Well, it is rather obvious, sir.

249
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:38,248
Yes, she is a dead ringer
for Connie Selica.

250
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:46,987
She ... she is pretty unique,
isn't she, Niles?

251
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:49,446
Whatever you say, sir.

252
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,500
Oh, oh, careful there, man.

253
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,502
Oh! Thank you, sir, yes. You see,
I should have used my oven mitt

254
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:57,163
instead of this somewhat
inferior substitution.

255
00:16:57,163 --> 00:17:01,394
But I didn't realize I wanted my oven
mitt until I saw them together.

256
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:05,155
And then I understood that of course
my oven mitt is exactly what I wanted,

257
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:09,963
and goodness gracious it was
under any nose the entire time.

258
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:19,204
Good, glad you found it.

259
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:24,873
It's easy for you to get sale shoes.
You're a double "A" width.

260
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:28,350
No, I'm really a "B,"
but for 75 percent off,

261
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,108
I'll hold my toes like this.

262
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:34,009
Stop it.
/ You stop it.

263
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:39,230
Leslie, darling, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

264
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,593
I hope you two found something
to talk about. / Uh-huh ...

265
00:17:43,727 --> 00:17:45,226
Well, shall we?
/ Sure.

266
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:48,546
But I just can't sit backwards
in the limo. I get nauseous.

267
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:52,342
Oh, well, there's pepto
in the mini-bar. Smile.

268
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:59,630
Oh, I forgot to put the thingie on.
Now they're going to have red eyes.

269
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,681
Oh, boy, are they
a great couple or what?

270
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,150
Boy, if they're not met
to be together, who is?

271
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,638
Miss Fine, doesn't Miss Leslie
remind you of someone?

272
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:14,742
What am I, a radish? That hair,
those clothes, that voice.

273
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:17,890
She's a dead ringer for Audrey Hepburn.

274
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,421
Ma, Shirley Bassie? I don't know.

275
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:31,572
200, 220.

276
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:34,045
She goes up and down.

277
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,894
Hi, guys. / Oh, hi, honey.
How was school today?

278
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:41,165
Great, lots of fun.
There is so much to learn.

279
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:45,707
Ma, I gotta go be a nanny. Bye.

280
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,032
What the hell is wrong with him?

281
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:49,854
He seemed perfectly normal.

282
00:18:49,854 --> 00:18:53,068
I reiterate. What the hell
is wrong with him?

283
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:55,832
Mr. Sheffield thinks their talk
went rather well.

284
00:18:55,832 --> 00:19:00,502
Oh, Mr. Sheffield thinks Cee Cee goes
horseback riding for the exercise.

285
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:08,605
Smell Brighten's gym shirt.

286
00:19:09,597 --> 00:19:11,535
I don't smell anything.
/ Exactly.

287
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:15,447
And if anyone knows what a sweaty
man smells like, it's me.

288
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,313
Brighten did not go to gym class today.
/ Very impressive, Miss Fine.

289
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:23,900
Well, you don't watch eight years of
"Murder She Wrote" without
walking away with something.

290
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:34,514
Brighten Sheffield, you cut class today.
I am very disappointed in you, young man.

291
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:39,154
I just said that in case
the intercoms were on.

292
00:19:39,154 --> 00:19:42,368
Now, come on, you got a problem.
Let's talk about it.

293
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:44,298
I told you you couldn't understand.

294
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:49,395
Honey, I wouldn't understand?
My home room was Mc Donalds.

295
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:53,070
Come on, let's deal with it.
/ How?

296
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,689
Even if I grow another foot, I'll still
be smaller than most of the guys.

297
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:05,080
Another foot? What kind of school is this?

298
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:08,954
In grade school I was the big shot.
Fifth graders feared me.

299
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:13,701
Now in junior high, I'm a walking
wedgie waiting to happen.

300
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:20,414
Oh, now I'm getting the picture.

301
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:25,812
They're all bigger than you,
not bigger than you.

302
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,470
Honey, this I can handle.
Sweetie, you're only 12.

303
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,892
Most boys don't shoot up until
after their bar mitzvah.

304
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,977
But I'm not getting bar miktzvah.

305
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:41,689
Huh, I hope it still works.

306
00:20:41,689 --> 00:20:46,139
Honey, if it's any consolation to you,
given time, this will no longer be a problem.

307
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:50,492
Some day you're going to be a senior,
and you're going to be bigger
than all the other kids,

308
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:54,316
and you'll remember how you felt today.
When you walk down the hallway,

309
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:59,472
you'll see some puny seventh grader,
and you'll give him a little shove.

310
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:01,218
Thanks, Fran.

311
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,806
Just one more thing:

312
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:05,413
When you said, "This I can handle,"

313
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:07,709
what did you think I was talking about?

314
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:11,479
Oh, exactly what you said, that
you're shorter than everyone else.

315
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:15,491
Although your father was
off on some wacko jag.

316
00:21:21,438 --> 00:21:25,268
Looking for someone ...
/ Niles, you scared me.

317
00:21:25,268 --> 00:21:28,199
Put a bell around
your neck, would you?

318
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,043
You wanted him to have a life.

319
00:21:30,043 --> 00:21:33,209
Yeah, well, it's 11:00,
and he's got work tomorrow.

320
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,873
Well, you said he should have fun.

321
00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:37,689
9:00 o'clock is having fun.

322
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:41,375
11:00 o'clock is already I don't need
another kid to take care of.

323
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:45,638
And there's absolutely no one
else she reminds you of?

324
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:50,685
Oh, here he comes.
Stop yacking and act natural...

325
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:54,941
Niles, who is it?
/ Oddly enough, it's Mr. Sheffield.

326
00:21:55,896 --> 00:22:00,237
Oh, back so soon.
Did you have a good time?

327
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:04,978
Well, you know, pleasant enough.
/ Oh, you didn't like her?

328
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:09,566
Gee, I thought her charm was
only exceeded by her beauty.

329
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:12,306
Well, she had a certain
way about her.

330
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:17,133
There was just something missing.
/ Humm ...

331
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:19,902
Like ordering champagne and
getting ginger ale.

332
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:24,171
You know, they look alike but
don't make you feel the same.

333
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,453
Too bad. She was going to fix
me up with her boss ...

334
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:31,930
English, handsome, rich.

335
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,771
All right, he's got a couple of kids,
but I could learn to live with that.

336
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,948
Well, maybe next time. But I do
want to thank you, Miss Fine.

337
00:22:39,948 --> 00:22:43,348
For what? / Well, for getting
me out in the world.

338
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:47,027
I mean Leslie may not be the one,
but, well, at least you made me realize

339
00:22:47,027 --> 00:22:50,763
that perhaps I don't have to live
the rest of of my life alone.

340
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:54,082
Oh, good night, Mr. Sheffield.
/ Pleasant dreams, Miss Fine.

341
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:59,051
Yeah, well, if I'm lucky, I'll have
that one about the unicorn.

342
00:23:09,332 --> 00:23:11,709
I don't smell anything.
/ Exactly,

343
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:15,406
now if there's one thing I know,
it's what a smelly man ...

344
00:23:18,846 --> 00:23:20,159
woopsie.

345
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:23,563
If anyone knows what
a swelly man smells ...

346
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:28,353
I'm sorry.
