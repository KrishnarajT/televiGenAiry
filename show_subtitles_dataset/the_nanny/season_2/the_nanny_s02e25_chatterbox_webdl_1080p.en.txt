1
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:05,110
Ma, how could you be going
through a midlife crisis?

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,722
What are you going to do?
Live to a hundred and thirty?

3
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:11,777
Enough already with getting a job.

4
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:14,706
Ma, the bakery didn't fire
you because you were a woman,

5
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:18,134
they fired you because
you ate like a pig.

6
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,135
Now she's insulted.

7
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:28,141
Maggie, don't forget, you have an appointment
with Mr. Anthony at the Chatterbox

8
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:31,177
to get your hair done this afternoon.
/ Oh, is he really good?

9
00:00:31,177 --> 00:00:35,957
All the girls at Haley's sweet sixteen
are just gonna hate your guts.

10
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:38,028
I love you, Fran.

11
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:43,163
Oh, really, Miss Fine, is a sweet sixteen party
just about making your friends hate your guts?

12
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:44,955
Yes!

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,136
Hello, hello.

14
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:51,682
Cee Cee, tell me, did you have
one of these sweet sixteens?

15
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:56,231
Oh, please, all those little snot
noses trying to outdo each other.

16
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:58,343
I didn't want one.

17
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:01,005
No friends?
/ None.

18
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:10,628
Niles, my eggs are all dried up.
/ The gene pool is saved.

19
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,322
Oh, well, fasten your seat belts, kids.
We're about to enter the silicone valley.

20
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:18,085
What are all these women doing here?
/ Your father's holding auditions.

21
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:21,381
I told him not to cast
this role until after school.

22
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:25,750
Oh, if they've danced already,
there's going to be hell to pay.

23
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:29,801
Come on, Maggie, we gotta go to
the Chatterbox to get your hair done.

24
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:33,047
Oh, um, let me just go change out of
my uniform. / Oh, all right, but hurry up

25
00:02:33,047 --> 00:02:36,054
because nobody has ever kept
Mr. Anthony waiting,

26
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:39,764
except Susan Powter.
Need I say more?

27
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:44,222
Excuse me? Can you break a twenty?
The cab driver's holding on to it until I can get —

28
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,615
change.

29
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:51,241
Well, it doesn't matter.
This part is mine. / Oh ...

30
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:55,832
Blue is my lucky color. Look,
the entire house is done in blue.

31
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,665
Honey, honey ...

32
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,216
Bummer.

33
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:07,669
Well, it still doesn't matter.
What do they have that I don't have?

34
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,311
These are prescription, right?

35
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:15,041
Are you here for the tall,
voluptuous show girl, 18 to 25?

36
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,593
Oh, your eyes are fine.

37
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:21,830
No, I'm not auditioning.
/ So you must be one of the producers.

38
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,241
Better. The nanny.

39
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:27,309
Let me look at your resume.
Maybe I can give you a few pointers.

40
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:30,632
Um, Mary Ruth, well, that's gotta go.

41
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:34,128
You need more experience.
/ I don't have any.

42
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:47,591
Hau — oh, my stomach
is in knots — hau.

43
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:50,240
My acting teacher always says
when you get really nervous — hau —

44
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,165
just imagine all the people you're
auditioning for naked.

45
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:59,778
Well, picture her because I've seen him.
And trust me, that's not gonna calm you down.

46
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,494
Thank you, babe.

47
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:07,920
Shall a leave a picture?
/ Ha, ha, ha.

48
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,969
Wow! That went so much better
than my last audition.

49
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,758
Honey, how much are you paying this acting teacher?

50
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:22,930
Nothing. We were living together until
he threw me out for an actress with more talent.

51
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:26,446
So now I have no place to live, no job,

52
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:30,161
nowhere to go, and no means of support.
But I can't complain.

53
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:33,529
You're not Jewish, are you?

54
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:40,929
Listen, I'm on my way to the Chatterbox salon,
and someone told me that they need a new shampoo girl.

55
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:42,673
Well, that sounds perfect.

56
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:43,957
Let me see your resume

57
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:48,619
cause, you know, Mr. Anthony only
hires people from the most exclusive salons.

58
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:52,001
Now is Super Cuts one word or two?

59
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:05,038
Chatterbox, Claude speaking.

60
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:10,406
What do you mean she's canceling
her four o'clock with Mr. Anthony?

61
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:14,725
You can't cancel with Mr. Anthony
without a 48-hour notice.

62
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,761
Well, when did she die?

63
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:21,419
Hello?

64
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:27,603
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Rauuu!

65
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:33,546
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

66
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,218
Come over here.

67
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:45,396
I'm very satisfied.

68
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:50,819
Ma, what do you think you're doing?

69
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,932
It's my turn to tip.

70
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:59,926
Don't worry, Sylvia.
I still got plenty of room on this side.

71
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:04,559
Oh, Mr. Anthony, I'm a married woman.

72
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,813
Come here.

73
00:06:10,602 --> 00:06:13,618
Like a ripe cantelope.

74
00:06:16,196 --> 00:06:19,107
You bruise it, you bought it.

75
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:27,740
Now, remember what I told you.
When I introduce you to
Mr. Anthony, picture him naked.

76
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,043
But I'm not nervous. / So what?

77
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:37,654
Mr. Anthony, your 3:30 is here.
/ Hey, Franny, ohhh,

78
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:42,151
look at that body, look at that shape.
/ Oh, Mr. Anthony ...

79
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,521
No one conditions like you.

80
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,979
Thanks. This is Maggie.
/ Hi.

81
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:51,359
She's invited to her first
sweet sixteen party.

82
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:55,016
Oh, you're sixteen; you're beautiful,

83
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:57,380
and you're mine.

84
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:01,865
I made that up.

85
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:07,426
So would you like to slip into
something a little more comfortable?

86
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,564
Okay.

87
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,107
Claude will get you a smock.

88
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:16,818
You know, Claude has styled
a lot of celebrities.

89
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:20,529
He's the one that told
Jerry Lewis more oil.

90
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:24,919
Oh, a natural blond.
Well, now there's two of us.

91
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:27,673
Honey, honey, come here, come here.

92
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:32,049
Oh, Mr. Anthony, this is Mary Ruth,
your new shampoo girl.

93
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:35,789
Oh, not so fast. I just don't
hire anyone off the street.

94
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,897
Let me see your resume.

95
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,812
Oh, Super Cuts.

96
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,766
What — what are you staring at?

97
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,837
Nothing. I was just picture you nake —

98
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:59,890
before we start, I think it's only fair
to warn you that I am first
and foremost an actress.

99
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:02,352
And at any moment, I may get
a lead on Broadway,

100
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:07,427
or Merv Griffin could call and want
a game show hostess, and it could
all happen so quickly.

101
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:09,176
In show business,
they needed you yesterday.

102
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:14,234
Do you sweep? / Yes.
/You're hired./ Bless you, Mr. Anthony.

103
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:22,226
You know, Yetta, Maggie is going to
a sweet sixteen at the Statue of Liberty.

104
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:27,016
Big deal, I had mine on Ellis Island.

105
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:31,378
So many people came.

106
00:08:31,572 --> 00:08:34,957
Yetta, you were in quarantine.

107
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,666
I thought it went on a little long.

108
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,521
Okay, Sylvia. You're all done.

109
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,508
Thank you, Kim.

110
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:48,411
Ah, how long should
I wait before I eat?

111
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,406
Oh, about four years.

112
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,934
I tell you, I'm going to
love working here.

113
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:04,220
What do you mean? / I took a really
good interview with Mr. Anthony.

114
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:10,088
Oh, you're the one that told me
Mr. Anthony was looking for a new shampoo girl.

115
00:09:10,088 --> 00:09:13,338
Yeah. Why?
/ Nothing.

116
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:19,762
I am practically a shoe in. The only
other person who applied is Estelle ...

117
00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:30,454
But he wants somebody young.

118
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,151
You know, Ma, I don't think
it's such a good idea

119
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:38,096
you working here and handling
all those permanent wave fumes.

120
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:44,212
Oh, I love them fumes.
Gives me a nice buzz.

121
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:50,976
Besides, Ma, daddy doesn't want you
to work. Who's going to feed him lunch?

122
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:55,218
What? He can't add water to
the Top Ramen himself?

123
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:58,913
Yeah. But if you're not there to stop
him, he's just gonna keep eating.

124
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:04,434
Remember Uncle Aaron —may he rest
in peace — he exploded that Chanukah.

125
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,868
The doctor said it was a freak occurrence.
/ Yeah.

126
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:12,914
You can't eat 32 latkas and sit
that close to a menorah.

127
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:22,162
Meanwhile, where was Aunt Polly?

128
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:24,655
At work.
/ Ohhhh ...

129
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:27,864
Oh, you're right.
I'm being selfish.

130
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:31,577
I have to sacrifice
my career for my man.

131
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:35,710
Oh, Ma, you're doing the right thing.

132
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,391
Thank you, Fran.
I got the job with Mr. Anthony.

133
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:42,237
Ow! Ma, stop pinching me.

134
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:53,109
This is my best nail I ever paint.

135
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:55,467
This is my country.

136
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,705
That's my sister.

137
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:02,484
That's her husband.

138
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:06,662
And that's the cat.

139
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:11,878
It's amazing you can paint with so much detail.
/ Meanwhile, I'm going blind.

140
00:11:11,878 --> 00:11:14,255
Ahhhhhh!
/ What was that?

141
00:11:14,255 --> 00:11:17,505
Calm down. Just bikini wax.

142
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:28,871
Might as well face it,
you're addicted to love.

143
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:32,905
Your heart sweats, oh, your body shakes.

144
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:34,421
Yeah. You're mine.

145
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:37,916
Meanwhile, what you staring at?
Like I don't know.

146
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:42,619
Please, he's not my type. I don't go
for that dark wavy hair, blue eyes —

147
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,715
what is that — a 30-inch waist?
/ 29, long.

148
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:55,804
So, how was your first day?
/ Long — hard — good. Bye.

149
00:11:59,436 --> 00:12:02,261
Did you sweep?
/ Yes.

150
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,863
Good. Then, you can go home.
/ Great.

151
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:11,239
Do you know a nice hotel around
here or maybe a shelter?

152
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:16,050
I don't really know Queens.
/ Well, now you know one. Charmed.

153
00:12:18,428 --> 00:12:23,846
Well, ah, I'll tell you what.
Until you get back on your feet,
you can stay in the back room.

154
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:28,645
It's not really fit for a human being.
Oh, and when my mother comes, you've gotta get out.

155
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:34,346
Thank you, Mr. Anthony. Kim, he's so sweet.
He's letting me stay in the back room.

156
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:40,540
Oh, good. It was going to be employee lounge,
but this much better, you deserve it.

157
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:48,169
Oh, yeah? Well, come over
here and say that.

158
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:52,338
Geez, it was just an expression.

159
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:54,938
Come meet new shampoo girl, Mary Ruth.

160
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:57,971
Mary Ruth, this is
Mr. Anthony's son Mimo.

161
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,820
I didn't know Mr. Anthony had a son.

162
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,367
Sure. This is Mimo's class picture.

163
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:07,819
Only one without a tie.

164
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:12,529
Ah, excuse me.
I couldn't help but notice,

165
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,625
you have a little blood gushing
out of the side of your head.

166
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:20,334
Look, lady, I'm 13, I live in New York,
and my father owns a beauty parlor.

167
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:24,040
This is not an uncommon thing.

168
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,216
You poor kid.
/ Lady, I'm all right, really.

169
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:29,187
Well, let me take care of
that for you. / Okay.

170
00:13:29,187 --> 00:13:33,789
You know, the head bleeds the most.
It's something about the capillaries
being close to the —

171
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:37,503
oh, I'm getting a little queasy.
I'm not that good with blood.

172
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:38,364
Mimo — / Huh?

173
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:42,385
Swear you won't let my dress
fall over my head.

174
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:48,942
Well, she fits in perfectly.
Another fruit loop for the bowl.

175
00:13:49,922 --> 00:13:54,172
Mimo, who were you fighting with?
Was it that Glen Chamoff bully again?

176
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:58,876
I have a good mind to teach that boy
a lesson if he wasn't so big for his age.

177
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:03,649
Hey, you be nice. His mother
good customer, nice lady. I see her tomorrow.

178
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,321
I'll give her fungus.

179
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:10,303
There's gotta be a Band-Aid
around here somewhere.

180
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:13,100
Oh, no, no, no, just stay out of there.
It's private. Okay? Just stay out of there.

181
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,798
I'm not interested in anything in
this drawer except for a Band-Aid.

182
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:19,835
Oh, what's this?
/ Give me that.

183
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:22,268
Okay. I'm sorry.
I'll mind my own business.

184
00:14:22,268 --> 00:14:25,999
That's Mimo's mother.
/ Really?

185
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:31,639
She's very pretty. Someone should
—should fix the glass and put her out.

186
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,515
Oh, please, that will happen the day
the NFL asks me to play tight end.

187
00:14:37,923 --> 00:14:42,021
She break Mr. Anthony's heart. And when
she left him, he punched out the glass.

188
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:45,764
Oh, not to mention the mailbox, the dumpster.
/ Sister Mary Margaret.

189
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:50,443
Well, that was an accident.
/ Oh, boy, she went down like
a ton of bricks.

190
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:55,546
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone ...
/ Bah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

191
00:14:55,546 --> 00:15:00,191
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone ...
/ Bah, bah, bah, bah.

192
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:04,075
When I see you, I could do — wait —

193
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:09,356
where'd you get that?
/ Out of the drawer.

194
00:15:09,356 --> 00:15:13,717
Mimo? / Hey, it's a junk drawer.
I don't know how it got in there.

195
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:15,303
Mimo?

196
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:21,115
Hey, this isn't "Les Miserables."
Get back to work.

197
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:25,988
You know, it's so obvious what's going on here.
/ Yeah. You're about to get fired.

198
00:15:25,988 --> 00:15:31,092
No, no, no, no, no. All these years that
you have been hating her, he has been missing her.

199
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:35,227
I'm guessing you're one of those girls that's
got a real urge to reach out to people?

200
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:41,479
Yep. / Fight that. Now, let's put
this back where it belongs.

201
00:15:48,378 --> 00:15:53,000
I should have hired Sylvia. I would have
gotten a little peace and quiet around here.

202
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:59,540
My own daughter betrayed me.
Now I know how Nancy Reagan felt.

203
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:05,626
Ma, I'm sorry. What can
I do to make it up to you?

204
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:08,489
Marry Mr. Sheffield.

205
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:14,282
Ma, you're insane. It's a good thing
I take after grandma Yetta. Oy!

206
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:20,864
I have no career. All my life I've been
somebody's daughter, somebody's wife, somebody's mother.

207
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:24,071
Who the hell am I?

208
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:27,982
Miss Fine!
/ Next.

209
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:30,632
I was strolling along Lexington
Avenue with my lawyer

210
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:34,554
when he nudges me to check out the —
and I quote — "hot brunette."

211
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:38,300
Oh, that's impossible.
I was on Fifth.

212
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,074
Not you, Miss Fine. My 15-year-old daughter's
wearing a wig that makes her look 25.

213
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:47,059
25? Cool.

214
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:49,195
Hey, do I look old enough
to get into a club?

215
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:52,197
Sure. And we haven't even
put the lashes on yet.

216
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:55,022
Which we are not going to do because
you're just a little girl.

217
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:59,771
Now, get upstairs and make your daddy
a cupcake in your Easy Bake oven.

218
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:03,113
Miss Fine, whatever possessed you?

219
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:05,951
Well, every girl should experiment
with her look.

220
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:10,359
When I was her age, I dyed my hair
red just like Ruda Lenska.

221
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,163
Oh, within two days I was — oh,
that wig is definitely going back.

222
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:20,006
Don't you worry. They'll give us
a full refund at the Chatterbox.

223
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:22,456
I'm like family there.

224
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,298
Fran who?

225
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:28,653
Nope. No returns. No refunds.

226
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:32,300
Sorry, dear, tears don't work on me.

227
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,994
Neither does that.

228
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:39,147
Well, that might work
if I close my eyes.

229
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:42,391
Hey, watch it, you're drowning me.

230
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:45,885
You never washed someone else's hair before?
/ Actually, this was my first time.

231
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:48,536
Oh, then you're pretty good.

232
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:54,479
Hey, Claude, give me some big hair.
I got my nephew's bar mitzvah tomorrow.

233
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:57,067
I really want to pop.

234
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:59,766
You're Jewish?
/ Nope. I married one.

235
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:04,110
They make good husband. No cheat,
no drink, and every Sunday night,

236
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,105
he in the mood for Chinese.

237
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:11,850
Look what I did for Mimo.

238
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,408
Oh, you take picture of mother
out of garbage and fix it.

239
00:18:16,408 --> 00:18:18,469
Very good.

240
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:21,646
We got employee lounge back.

241
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:25,581
Poor, Mr. Anthony, all that anger
is just because he's lonely.

242
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:30,818
Sure he tries to hide it.
/ Oh, yes. Tonight he's hiding it with Bernice.

243
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,681
He's seeing someone?
Well, you know what they say.

244
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:39,534
All the good ones are either
married or seeing someone or ...

245
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:44,904
I think it's just those
two things they say.

246
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,200
So what's she like?
/ Who? Bernice?

247
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,491
Oh, she very smart girl, two brains.

248
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:55,191
See, now that is classic.

249
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:59,047
He's avoiding a serious relationship
because he doesn't want to get hurt again.

250
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:02,243
I wonder how much a pair of brains
like that cost?

251
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:05,077
My darling, if you want to work here,
let me give you a little advice.

252
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,456
Stay out of Mr. Anthony's private life.

253
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:12,708
Look, I am not afraid of Mr. Anthony.
He has got to start putting
his son's needs ahead of his own.

254
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:17,322
And I will tell him that right to
his face. / What's that?

255
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:22,712
Pier One is having a two for one frame sale.
And I thought Mimo would like
the frame of equal or lesser value.

256
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:28,146
You know, when you alphabetized
my styling mousses, I said,

257
00:19:28,146 --> 00:19:30,985
all right; she's eager.

258
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:37,183
When you convinced Mrs. Wilk to cut her hair
short so she wouldn't have to come back for six months,

259
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:40,359
I said, all right, she's stupid.

260
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:44,888
But when you interfere in my personal
life against direct orders,

261
00:19:44,888 --> 00:19:48,069
I say, all right, she's fired!

262
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:54,406
You know, when a guy punches out
a picture of his wife,
I say all right, he's in pain.

263
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:58,828
When he throws that picture into the trash,
I say, all right, he's in denial.

264
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:03,468
But when he fires the one person who is just
trying to bring him and his son closer together,

265
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:09,517
I say, please don't fire me, Mr. Anthony.

266
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:13,564
How many times do I have to tell you?
Nobody wants this picture.

267
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:15,319
I do.

268
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,901
See. I told you.

269
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:22,228
And close.
This is none of your business.

270
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:27,454
And if you're gonna pretend to cut her hair
over there would you at least
put some scissors in your hand.

271
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:33,689
Mimo, what do you need this picture for?

272
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:36,635
I don't know. I — well, just
in case she ever came back,

273
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,249
I guess I'd know what she looked like.

274
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:41,603
Well, then you should keep
it because she's your mother.

275
00:20:41,603 --> 00:20:44,868
Do you mind? I know how to talk to my kid.

276
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:49,849
Then you should keep it because
she was your mother.

277
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:58,000
And just for the record, ah,
she walked out on me, not you.

278
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:01,083
Ohhh!

279
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,520
Oh, this is a real Kodak moment.

280
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,602
Okay, smile.

281
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:22,324
There, now you look like
my little girl again.

282
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:26,954
I'm not going. No guys will be
the least bit interested in me.

283
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:30,250
Good. Then you'll have
no problem being home by 10:00.

284
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:37,337
Come on, Margaret, no boy in his right mind would
be the least bit attracted to that ridiculous wig ...

285
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,543
Oh, Miss Fine, look at you.

286
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:46,737
Well, they wouldn't take it back,
and I didn't want it to go to waste.

287
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,979
Are you sure you don't want
to go out for ice cream?

288
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:52,250
Huh? Who said that? Oh, Niles,
we're going out for ice cream.

289
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,807
Oh, I thought you were exhausted, sir.

290
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:58,428
I drew you a bath in the Jacuzzi with
eucalyptus oil and a snifter of brandy.

291
00:21:58,428 --> 00:22:02,747
Well, I've got a second wind.
I'll go hail a cab.

292
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:07,099
Well, wouldn't want it to go to waste.

293
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:13,006
Well, can you believe that he's going.
Two minutes ago, he was dead to the world.

294
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:16,078
One look at this wig and
he's ready for a double dip.

295
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:19,979
I tell you, I don't know
whether to be flattered or insulted.

296
00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:23,484
Look, what do you say
we take in a movie as well?

297
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:26,196
Flattered it is.
