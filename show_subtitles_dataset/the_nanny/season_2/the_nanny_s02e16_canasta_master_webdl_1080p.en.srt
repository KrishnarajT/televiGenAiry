1
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:09,877
Man, do they realize how many times
they could have gotten off this island
if it weren't for Gilligan?

2
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,764
Why don't they just kill him?

3
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:17,743
Just because a person is a useless pest
doesn't mean they deserve to die.

4
00:00:17,743 --> 00:00:22,295
Hello, hello. / Of course
that's not written in stone.

5
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:23,810
Brighten, are you still sitting here?

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,118
Doesn't Miss Fine have anything to say
about you wasting all day watching television?

7
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,547
Did Lovey redecorate the hut yet?

8
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:33,530
Miss Fine, why has Brighten been watching
this "Gilligan" show all morning?

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,793
Well, it's a marathon.

10
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:44,682
Plus, we want to see when they change
the theme song from "All the Rest"
to "The Professor and Marianne ..."

11
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:47,760
Brighten, don't you have
any interest in a team sport?

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,389
Only as an owner.

13
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:53,274
Oh, I don't know. I just don't
understand it, Miss Fine.

14
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:56,432
When I was his age, I was already
captain of the water polo team.

15
00:00:56,432 --> 00:01:01,342
Water polo? What do
you swim with horses?

16
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:06,035
What happens when they raise
their tails? Look out.

17
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:11,353
Aspirin, Ibuporfen,
or shall I just surprise you?

18
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:13,642
You know what? I gotta go
into Queens anyway.

19
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:16,261
Why don't I just take Brighten
with me to the batting cages.

20
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:20,452
A lot of guys always hang out that.
I know I always had fun.

21
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:24,003
You played baseball?
/ Yeah.

22
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:27,554
I just wish Brighten was interested in
some of the sports I played.

23
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,863
Look, you can't make your kid
like what you like.

24
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:32,973
My mother always made me go
with her to her ballet classes.

25
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:35,607
Your mother took ballet?
What must that have been like?

26
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:39,474
Picture the hipopotamuses
in "Fantasia."

27
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:35,230
Hi, Ma. Well,
so much for sports.

28
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,372
Brighten got hit with a ball.

29
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,926
Oh, those batting cages
are so dangerous.

30
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,384
You could put an eye out.

31
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:45,646
He wishes.
/ Ohhhhhhh ...

32
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:55,335
You want grandma
to kiss the boo-boo?

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,348
Isn't it enough I got
one kid in therapy?

34
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:08,296
Honey, go in and watch the "Gilligan"
marathon with my father.

35
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:12,798
If it looks like he's wearing lipstick,
it's just the pistachio nuts.

36
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:17,570
Morty, the boy's coming in.
Do up your pants.

37
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,814
Sweetheart, we gotta talk to you
about the canasta tournament.

38
00:03:23,814 --> 00:03:27,063
Oh, I'm so excited about
going to Atlantic City.

39
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:30,493
But I'm not rooming with Gert.
It's one thing to think you're Madonna.

40
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:34,570
It's a whole another thing to wear
your Depends on the outside.

41
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,126
Don't worry.
We're out of the tournament.

42
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,788
Now we don't have a fourth.

43
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:52,196
I'll look in my phone book.
Maybe I can find someone else.

44
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:56,359
Tessie Fink, she's good.
/ Ma, she's dead.

45
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:00,011
She is? I just saw her in temple.

46
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:02,435
Didn't you think it was odd that
you were sitting in a chair

47
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:06,252
and she was lying in a box?

48
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:10,760
Oh, I thought they got
that for her back.

49
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:19,041
Morty's nauseous. He says he wants
the leftover Chinese food to settle his stomach.

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:24,819
Morty, it's been in there a week.
Do you want to end up in intensive care?

51
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,826
You ate it for breakfast, Ma?
/ Yeah.

52
00:04:29,219 --> 00:04:31,979
She doesn't even bother
to warm it up.

53
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,556
She sticks her fork in,
pulls the carton off,

54
00:04:34,556 --> 00:04:41,085
and eats it like a giant Chinese
Dove bar. Ahhhhh ...

55
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:43,688
So tell me, what episode
are they up to?

56
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:46,037
Ah, Marianne thinks she's Ginger.

57
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:50,297
Oh, and she cut down all Ginger's gowns.
Oh, that gave me nightmares.

58
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:52,596
It scared her more than "Psycho."

59
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:58,284
Yes, butchering Janet Leigh was
nothing compared to butchering
that strapless Oleg Cassini. Hu-huh.

60
00:04:58,284 --> 00:05:02,330
There is no excuse for violence
like that on television.

61
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,331
This is a lot like rummy, right?
/ It's much more complicated.

62
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:09,353
You melt? / Yeah.

63
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:11,896
Two decks?
/ Uh-huh.

64
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:16,798
See if you can keep up with me because
I have a tendency to play too fast.

65
00:05:16,798 --> 00:05:21,537
I'm out.
/ Wow, B, that's amazing.

66
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,873
I've never seen anything like that.

67
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:27,238
He must be one of those special
people that has a knack.

68
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:31,235
What are they called?
/ Idiots.

69
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:35,967
Savants, Yetta.
Cousin Marty was an idiot.

70
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,238
Although, he could
look up in the sky

71
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:42,407
and tell you which pigeon was
going to poop on him.

72
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:45,507
Yeah, but did he move? No.

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,794
This is cool. All right, ladies.
Cut the chitchat. Deal.

74
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:53,170
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

75
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,641
Yeah. That we should
replace Gert with Brighten

76
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:59,125
and make him our fourth
in Atlantic City. / Nah.

77
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:05,517
I shouldn't eat stuffed cabbage
this close to a pilot light.

78
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:15,103
You know, dad was right.

79
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:17,159
It feels really good to be
a member of a team.

80
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:22,490
Now, next week do I bring knishes
or low-sodium bunt cake?

81
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:27,295
You know, honey, why don't you let me
tell your father the good news
about being on the team

82
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:33,996
cause you know he's just going to die,
and I may not be far behind.

83
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:37,620
Ah, Niles, let me ask you a question.
/ Uh-huh.

84
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,472
If you only had one son

85
00:06:40,472 --> 00:06:46,805
and he decided that he wanted to play
on my grandmother's canasta team,

86
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:49,689
how would you react?

87
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:53,239
Oh, I've got to be in there for this.

88
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,834
I want to see, too.
/ Oh, what's your cover?

89
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,855
I can pretend I'm dusting.

90
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:00,209
Well, I'll tell him
I need a book.

91
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,884
Amateur. You're not
ready for that room.

92
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:07,157
Oh, sweetheart, the office
is for heavy hitters.

93
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:12,634
Next time in the kitchen giving your father
a coronary, you'll be the first I call.

94
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:16,631
Maxwell, perhaps
I'm being overly sensitive,

95
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:20,752
but I think Niles has it in for me.

96
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,137
Cee Cee, it's just his way.
He doesn't mean you any harm.

97
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:28,791
I'm sure it's all in your head ...

98
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:41,516
So, Miss Fine, back from the batting
cages? How did my boy do?

99
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:46,681
Well, he made contact with the ball.

100
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,973
And he'll have a great career
if the Bee Gee's ever get back together.

101
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:58,708
Would you look at her in the middle of the day.
Boy, I wish I could sleep like that.

102
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:02,534
Maxwell, Niles hit me in the head.

103
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:05,391
Cee Cee, he's standing way over here.

104
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:08,456
Stop picking on the man.

105
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:12,034
She never let's up, sir.

106
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:15,145
Did you want something, Niles?

107
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:18,613
Can't the butler just
come in and say hi?

108
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:21,447
All right. What are you two up to?

109
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:23,144
Nothing, nothing.

110
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:26,140
Well, baseball didn't exactly
work out for Brighten,

111
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,304
but he did find a game, and
he's very excited about it.

112
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:34,441
Well, there you are, you see, I told you there'd
be an alternative to television. / Yep.

113
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,254
So, come on, what's the game?
Soccer? Hockey?

114
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:40,267
Well, you need to fill me in.
I need to know what equipment to buy.

115
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:46,037
Well, maybe a nice teflon bunt
pan might come in handy.

116
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,277
Okay. I'm just going to spill it.

117
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:53,967
Because it's best to tell people stuff instead of
letting it fester inside and then you babble on and on —

118
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,670
Miss Fine.
/ Canasta.

119
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,864
Canasta? Doesn't your mother
and grandmother play —

120
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:05,050
Miss Fine, you're not telling me my son is
joining your mother's canasta team?

121
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,461
No. It's Yetta's team.

122
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:13,166
Look, maybe you misunderstood me.
I wanted him to play a manly sport,

123
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:19,864
you know, toughen him up a little.
/ Well, some of the teams have men, I think.

124
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:26,288
At a certain age the hormones go.
So that's anybody's guess really.

125
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,967
Oh, God, this is sounding
worse by the minute.

126
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,783
Next you're going to tell me
they have a uniform.

127
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:38,543
Oh, well, now, they're very tough, masculine,
pink bowling uniforms with a name on it.

128
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:43,878
Oh, no. It's going to be something
awful like "Flushing Queens."

129
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,747
Oh, my God, you mean that's it?

130
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,373
What? My only son is going
to be wearing a jacket

131
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:54,976
that says "Brighten" on the front
and "Flushing Queen" on the back?

132
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:58,486
No. His will say "Gert."

133
00:09:58,486 --> 00:10:02,116
Oh, I, I better take care of that.
I better take care of that before

134
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:05,725
the contest in Atlantic City.
/ Are you insane?

135
00:10:05,725 --> 00:10:08,656
You, you don't actually think
I'm going to let him go.

136
00:10:08,656 --> 00:10:13,652
And if you're going to pretend you're dusting there,
at least put a bloody cloth in your hands.

137
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:19,653
Maxwell, if the child has a knack.
I was good at hunting.

138
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,327
But mommy said I excelled at trapping.

139
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:28,080
Oh, take good care of your teeth, sir.
You may need to gnaw off a leg some day

140
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:36,675
Mr. Sheffield, you're
worrying for nothing.

141
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:40,456
I had a friend, Pauly Russo.
He was raised by two grandmothers.

142
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:43,826
He turned out to be the most masculine of men.

143
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:50,809
You should see him today —
big black mustache, leather cap, chaps. Humm ...

144
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,262
Miss Fine!

145
00:10:58,228 --> 00:11:02,099
Ma, all these cards are
sticking together.

146
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:08,476
Ah, it's a little crystal light.

147
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:14,293
Now I'm in the mood for something sweet.

148
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:20,379
Well, here. Try this queen of hearts.
I think it's got some Smucker's on the back.

149
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,783
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think someone was marking these cards.

150
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:31,703
What?

151
00:11:31,887 --> 00:11:37,075
Ma, you've been cheating all these years,
and we still lose?

152
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:39,764
No hitting during the game.

153
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:44,282
I could fight my own battles.
/ Can we play? Hey!

154
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:47,848
Now you're part of the family.

155
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:51,186
I can't wait to hit the buffet
tables in Atlantic City.

156
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:54,439
He's got a safari jacket
with 14 pockets in it.

157
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:58,368
We'll never have to order room service.

158
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:01,006
Didn't you tell her?

159
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:03,753
What's the matter, Ma?

160
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:08,785
You got that look on your face like right
before you weigh in at Jenny Craig.

161
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:12,592
Brighten, take this into Morty.

162
00:12:13,531 --> 00:12:19,411
If it looks like he's wearing rouge it's
just some residue from the barbecue potato chips.

163
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:23,672
So what's going on?

164
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:26,152
Gert's back from Florida.

165
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:29,539
She found an alligator in the pool.

166
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:33,291
She thought it was an inflatable one.

167
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,747
PS — 80 stitches.

168
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:42,262
Wow. What does she think? She's going to
waltz herself back in on the team? Tough.

169
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,963
Not after what I went through
with Mr. Sheffield.

170
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:49,171
I'm not breaking that little boy's heart.
I'm not telling him he's out.

171
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:51,986
Good. Cause he's not.

172
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:55,471
Well, who then?

173
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:59,639
Franny, you're such a pretty girl.

174
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:09,048
Oh, Mommy, fire that maid.
She's too old.

175
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:15,962
Oh, she fished me out of that lake years ago.
How long is she going to milk that?

176
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,026
Uh-huh.

177
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:24,315
No, no, I'm having lunch
with Betsy. Ha, ha, ha.

178
00:13:24,943 --> 00:13:28,406
Uh-huh. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

179
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,600
No, wait till she sees me.
I look like a million bucks.

180
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:37,832
Oh, all right.

181
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:41,656
Niles ... Yetta just called,

182
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,896
apparently Brighten showed up for
practice without all his equipment.

183
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,028
Excuse me, sir, but I packed
his gear myself.

184
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:53,447
Well, you forgot the Lipton onion soup mix
and the non-fat sour cream.

185
00:13:54,368 --> 00:13:56,636
Well, don't look at me like that, Niles.

186
00:13:56,636 --> 00:14:00,126
I just wanted Brighten to be involved
in something a little more virile.

187
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:06,523
Like musical theater? Well, at least
your father was supportive of that.

188
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:11,385
Niles, don't you remember? He refused to come
to my first production, "Sound of Music."

189
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:13,477
I staged that when I was just 17

190
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,891
and all because I wouldn't
do what he wanted me to —

191
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:22,574
shut up, Niles. Book me
a suite in Atlantic City.

192
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:28,175
Done, sir. Trump Castle, ocean views
for the entire family,
and I can't wait to hit the slots.

193
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:31,145
Well, mind you, with Miss Fine in the tournament,
you'll have to take care of the children.

194
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:34,039
Oh, that sounds like fun.

195
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,042
Oh, dear. I think
I'm coming down with something.

196
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:43,177
It's getting worse.

197
00:14:43,177 --> 00:14:46,848
Can't go. Damn.

198
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:53,223
Ah, Niles, you got any seltzer?

199
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:56,659
Oy, I had too much pickled herring.
It's all right here.

200
00:14:57,184 --> 00:15:02,269
Oh, my God.
/ Edelweiss, edelweiss.

201
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,364
All right, all right.
You win, Miss Fine.

202
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:09,663
If Brighten really wants to play canasta,
then I suppose I should let him to follow his dream.

203
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:12,740
Oh, what dream? Playing cards
with a bunch of old ladies.

204
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,598
I think it's sick.
/ What? What about the tournament?

205
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,920
I thought you were thrilled to be
going to Atlantic City.

206
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,107
That pit? / Oh, God, I can feel those
capillaries tightening at the base of my skull.

207
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:28,146
Miss Fine, weren't you the one that
was so high on canasta? What happened?

208
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:31,118
They threw me off the team.

209
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,884
They don't want to play
with you anymore?

210
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:38,439
No. And it's not fair.
They were my friends first.

211
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,774
You, you mean my son is
on the team and you're not?

212
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,019
Yes.

213
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:46,972
Miss Fine, it's all right.

214
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:51,981
No. It's not. And I'm not going
to Atlantic City either.

215
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:54,160
There, there, come on now.

216
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,075
We've already made reservations for
the whole family. Isn't that right, Niles?

217
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,451
Oh, ah-choo.

218
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,725
No. / Saltwater taffy ...

219
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,142
No.

220
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:09,065
Your own suite, lots of
little shampoos? / No.

221
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:15,002
Ringside seats to Steve and Edie.
/ Cocktail or dinner show?

222
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:25,487
Come on, baby, go, baby ... Go, Mama needs a
— mama needs a papa. That's what Mama needs.

223
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:30,042
Oh ... Ahhhhh!

224
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:35,451
You see, I told you, you have to
stick with the same machine.

225
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:40,557
It's a whole system. God,
there must be twenty bucks here.

226
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:42,989
Oh, Fran, you put in seventy five.

227
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:47,742
Yeah, but that was from the winnings of
the hundred that I put into that machine.

228
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:51,805
Oh, you know, I better go pick up
Gracie at casino camp.

229
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:55,903
It's about time. She must be
finished playing kiddie craps.

230
00:16:55,903 --> 00:16:58,579
Oh, I'll go pick her up.
I have a tennis lesson anyway.

231
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:04,149
Tennis? Oh, all that running back
and forth, back and forth.

232
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:09,396
Now that's a sport I never got.
/ Fran, there's the instructor.

233
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,248
Now I get it.

234
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:23,861
Fran, I hope you're not mad at me because
I took your place on the team.

235
00:17:23,861 --> 00:17:27,887
Oh, no, sweetie, I love you.

236
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:33,740
But she could look like Z.Z. Tutt before
I ever pluck a chin hair of hers again.

237
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,790
Sweetheart, don't be angry at me.

238
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,928
I had to think of the team's survival.

239
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:44,660
Remind me never to crash
in the Andies with you.

240
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,882
Sweetheart, you know I'd eat you last.

241
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:55,524
Not if I was the only kosher corpse.

242
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:04,026
Oh, boy, I hope you guys have tickets
because, you know, they're sold out

243
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,803
We know.

244
00:18:09,146 --> 00:18:12,032
Oh, my God,

245
00:18:12,734 --> 00:18:16,866
didn't you teach at PS 165?

246
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:22,405
No. / Oh, gee,
you look so familiar. What do you do?

247
00:18:22,944 --> 00:18:27,046
We sing.
/ Oh, I get it.

248
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:32,270
You do them in that impersonation show.
/ Yes.

249
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,784
Oh, ya, you could pass. You know,
the right lights, makeup, costume.

250
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:39,460
You, I don't know.
/ Oh, really?

251
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,161
Well, listen to this you're
walking along the street ...

252
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:46,763
or you're at a party, or else you're
alone and then you suddenly dig.

253
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:49,413
No, no, no, no, no. First of all,

254
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:55,530
you've got to put a lot more
shoulder into it.

255
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:00,884
And you, you gotta look at him
more adoringly. You love him, baby.

256
00:19:00,884 --> 00:19:04,771
You looking in someone's eyes,
you suddenly realize

257
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:08,183
that this could be the start
of something big ... Hey, hey.

258
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:10,776
Not bad.

259
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:15,111
You just gotta work on that chemistry
a little bit cause, you know,

260
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:20,292
that is the magic between
Steve and Edie, see.

261
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:23,184
Thank you.
/ Good luck.

262
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:26,193
I told you, you have to look at me adoringly.
/ I always look at you adoringly.

263
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,859
People are starting to notice that.

264
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:34,316
Oh, it's so sad. Some people
are living in such a dream world.

265
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:42,083
Wow, I can't believe
all this food's for free.

266
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:47,897
Yeah. And if you count your losses,
it only comes out to $49 a shrimp.

267
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:52,487
Right. Eat up.
I lost my shirt in kiddie craps.

268
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:57,164
What are I doing?
/ What? I love three-bean salad.

269
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:59,496
What is this? Your first buffet?

270
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:04,810
Salads are for suckers.
Go directly to the shell fish.

271
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:12,094
Oh, would you just look at
this beautiful gulf prawn,

272
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:16,129
gorgeous color, great markings.

273
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:19,178
This will be delicious later.

274
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:20,948
Come on, everyone.

275
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:23,275
Hurry up. The tournament's
going to start soon.

276
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:26,078
Miss Fine, where's your mother?
Too nervous to eat?

277
00:20:26,078 --> 00:20:31,001
Please, she had a snack
during her hysterectomy.

278
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:34,569
Oh, is it warm in here
or I'm svitzing?

279
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:37,847
Oh, honey, are you okay?

280
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:40,745
No. I don't think I can play.
You better make up with your mother.

281
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:43,828
Well, what hurts?
/ Oy, I think I'm going through the change.

282
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:47,370
It's going around.
The whole room's got it.

283
00:20:48,173 --> 00:20:54,544
Well, don't worry, B. I'm sure that
Flintstones make a chewable estrogen.

284
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:59,488
Honey, I know what you're doing,
and it's so sweet of you.

285
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:03,453
Oh, come on, Fran, playing means
more to you than it does to me.

286
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:06,129
Besides, I already
told them I quit.

287
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:09,433
Oh, is he a doll or what?

288
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:13,459
Brighten, that's a very nice gesture.
I'm, I'm proud of you.

289
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:15,843
I learned from the best.
/ Oh, well.

290
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:18,960
Not you, Dad, Gilligan.

291
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:25,594
Oh, yeah, that was the episode where
the Howells adopt Gilligan,

292
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:31,066
only he pretends to sleepwalk
because the skipper is lonely.

293
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:35,493
Oh ... Well, Miss Fine, come on,
if the team needs you, I suppose you better get in there.

294
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:39,295
Are you kidding?
The way my mother treated me,

295
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:42,834
she can come in here
on her hands and knees begging,

296
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,580
I wouldn't go.

297
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,746
Franny, you're in.
/ All right.

298
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,937
What? Was that any mother?

299
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:59,802
Poor sick Niles,
home alone like a dog.

300
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:55,280
You realize, of course,
now I'm going to have to kill you.

301
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,716
Yetta, if you're going to mark
your cards, at least do it smaller.

302
00:23:09,716 --> 00:23:12,589
I can't believe Gertie defected
to another team.

303
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:17,103
Ah, she's missing a chunk from
that alligator bite. It's a big turnoff.

304
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:21,586
Well, at least we got ourselves
a fourth. / Aha!

305
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,324
That's the card you're playing?
