1
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:33,008
Oh, Niles, this is an excellent
issue of "Vanity Fair."

2
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:36,761
Oh, really? What's in it?
/ Obsession —---

3
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:40,898
oh, Safari ...

4
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:46,008
Mel Gibson ...

5
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:50,716
He has a cologne?
/ No.

6
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:55,299
So now which one's Mr. Sheffield
and which one's Miss Fine?

7
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:58,495
She named her hamster after me.
/ Oh ...

8
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:03,041
How can you tell them apart?
/ Fran's the fat one.

9
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,925
She's not fat.
She just has big hair.

10
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:09,954
Oh, no, Mr. Sheffield is
fighting with Miss Fine.

11
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:13,401
He's not fighting with her.
He's having — / Mr. Sheffield,

12
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,349
get off of Miss Fine.
Miss Fine has a headache.

13
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:21,418
Oh, look, Mr. Sheffield
has already fallen asleep.

14
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:24,504
Okay, kids, go bring Miss Fine
upstairs and give her a chew stick.

15
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:27,176
She's not satisfied.

16
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:30,625
Miss Fine, this month's "Soap Opera
Hair Magazine" has arrived.

17
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,471
The bigger is better issue?
/ Uh-huh. With a free sample.

18
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:38,235
Oh, this is like Hanukkah in July.

19
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,253
Fran, I can't believe
you're doing that?

20
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:45,175
Why, honey? Did you think that
I got this fullness naturally?

21
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:47,987
Oh, no. This is just an outer shell.

22
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:51,205
Inside I've got gel,
mousse, volumizer.

23
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:55,140
There's a whole infrastructure
going on in there.

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,998
The only difference between me
and the kingdom is AstroTurf.

25
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:02,123
Fran, don't you care
about ecology?

26
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:06,149
There are chemicals in here that are
unsafe. Some of that stuff is toxic.

27
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,488
Honey, you want to clean up toxic waste,
start with Brighten's bathroom.

28
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:17,306
Fran, I'm serious. Give me that.
/ Oh, no, no, I didn't do the tendrils yet.

29
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,625
Oh, boy, I'm getting
a weird flashback here

30
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:27,075
only you're me and I'm my mother.
/ What are you talking about?

31
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:30,846
I was young too once,
out to save the world.

32
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:36,519
So you were like an activist
in the "60s? / '70s, late.

33
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,197
Nuclear power, animal rights,
cyclamates. / Cyclamates?

34
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:44,971
Oh, yeah, it was a big controversy.
Lemon Tang was never the same.

35
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:41,374
Mr. Sheffield, if you were my cousin Marsha
and you saw me in this dress, what would you do?

36
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:44,630
I'd, ah, tell you
you looked fabulous

37
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,961
and then trash you the moment
you left the room.

38
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,371
And?

39
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:54,612
And, um, eat an entire Sara Lee
pound cake? / There you go.

40
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:58,369
For a minute there I thought
I was going to have to change.

41
00:03:58,369 --> 00:04:00,735
Isn't it a little sedate
for you, Nanny Fine?

42
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:16,133
As a matter of fact, I am.
My great Aunt Mema Fager. She was 104.

43
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:20,738
Oh ... well, how'd she die?
/ Childbirth.

44
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:26,550
Fran, tell dad he's
being totally unfair.

45
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,443
Mr. Sheffield,
you're being totally unfair.

46
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,515
What is it I'm trying
to get him to do again?

47
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:35,227
Mark and I want to go to an all-night,
save-the-earth poetry reading.

48
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:41,233
Oh, right, what's the big deal? Maggie and Mark
want to go to an all-night save-the-earth — all night?

49
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:46,651
Oh, honey, kiss it off. / Fran, they're
having a candlelight vigil for animal rights.

50
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:51,387
Oh, that reminds me, I gotta
pick up the pastrami platter.

51
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:56,348
You know if it sits too long,
it gets that rainbow batina thing happening.

52
00:04:57,222 --> 00:05:00,920
I can't believe you. Is this
what happens when you turn when 21?

53
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,118
21 ...

54
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:06,794
Don't mock the child, Niles.

55
00:05:06,794 --> 00:05:11,185
Look, Maggie, why don't you and your friends
take it in turns to save the planet? Hum?

56
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:15,884
You could take the day shift and then someone
whose parents are out of town could take the night.

57
00:05:15,884 --> 00:05:18,801
Oh, fine. I'll go stand
in the hole in the ozone layer.

58
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,833
Be sure to wear sun block.

59
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:24,940
Well, Miss Fine, it's refreshing
to have you on my side for a change.

60
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,716
Oh, that. I read somewhere that the primary-care
giver should always agree with the guy that writes the checks.

61
00:05:31,716 --> 00:05:33,326
Uh-huh. Thank you for your support.

62
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:37,778
But for your information, I am too young
to be on the pig side of a generation gap.

63
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:42,714
Huff and puff as much as you like, Miss Fine.
This little piggy is not letting her go.

64
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:45,642
That doesn't mean I'm not thrilled
Margaret has a social conscience.

65
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:48,022
I just wish there were
more people like her.

66
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:53,054
Oh, aren't the elephant tusks exquisite.

67
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:58,772
They came from that cute
little poacher in Kenya.

68
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:02,718
And here I thought you'd had
your wisdom teeth pulled.

69
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:06,251
So when you're watching "Gorillas
in the Mist," you're thinking

70
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:10,807
in a fajita, I bet they're not so bad.

71
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:19,039
It was a gorgeous funeral.

72
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,311
Ah, Mema Fager didn't look so hot.
May she rest in piece.

73
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:30,084
She could never pull it together
from a special occasion.

74
00:06:30,084 --> 00:06:34,885
You know, when my time comes,
I don't want no open casket.

75
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:39,122
I don't trust no one to
put on my makeup but me.

76
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:50,565
How's the corned beef?
/ Fatty, Daddy. No good.

77
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:54,100
What do you do when you like something?
Eat the Corning Ware?

78
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,536
So when are you due?
/ Grandma, I'm not pregnant.

79
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:01,468
So stop eating.

80
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:07,923
Morty, turn the set down.
We're mourning in here.

81
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:10,727
Meanwhile, explain to me
green carnations on a casket.

82
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:13,046
St. Patty didn't drop dead.

83
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:17,429
Why didn't their side spend
a little on flowers like we did.

84
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,019
Syl, their side never
did as well as us.

85
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:23,263
What well? My daughter's a maid.

86
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:26,089
Nanny, Ma.

87
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:34,029
Meanwhile, I wonder who got
the coat. / What coat?

88
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:39,824
Mema's mink. She slept with it more
than she slept with Oscar.

89
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:42,569
Mema's husband's name was Louie.

90
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:46,903
Yeah. So where are
you not following me?

91
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,912
Oh, well, I guess it wasn't the mortician
that put that smile on her face.

92
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:57,004
Maybe we should see what's
in the envelope uncle Dave gave us.

93
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:59,572
I think it's a copy of the will.

94
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:02,990
You know, I always offered
to drive her to her checkups,

95
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,343
even after the bladder went.

96
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,422
Save it, Marsha. It's already written.

97
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,976
She's not coming back with an erasure.

98
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:17,070
Aunt Frita got Mema's diamond
wedding ring. / Ahhhhhh ...

99
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,969
I wanted that.

100
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:24,180
Cousin Judy got the blender.
/ Ahhhhhh ...

101
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,065
I could have used that.

102
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,309
Uncle Morey got the pasta machine.
/ Ahhhhhh ...

103
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,286
That they could have.

104
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:37,771
Who cares about their side.
Let's get to our side.

105
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:40,526
Their side, our side.
Who's keeping score?

106
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:46,216
Meanwhile, it's three zip.
/ Oh, please, Ma, calm down.

107
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:50,808
You're svitzing already.
Soon you're going to slide off the couch.

108
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:53,666
This is such a trying time for me.

109
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:58,575
Life won't be the same without
my beloved Mema. / Shut up, Marsha.

110
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:04,483
"And the coat goes to Fran Fine."
Come on down.

111
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:08,557
I won the coat? I won. I won.

112
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,960
May she rest in peace.

113
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,188
She gave Fran the coat?

114
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:19,608
Who schlepped her to the beauty parlor
every week to get her three hairs set?

115
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:22,329
Who smeared her with BenGay
after shuffle board,

116
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:26,421
and after she got the hammer toe
fixed, who lugged her around?

117
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:29,587
My husband, that's who.

118
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,447
Well, you can keep the coat
because I don't want it.

119
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,709
What are you nuts? Why?

120
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,574
Ma, I only wear fake fur.
And do you know why?

121
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:44,627
Yes. Because no one ever died
and left you a real one before.

122
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:48,133
No. I have a very impressionable
teenager at home that needs to know

123
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:52,519
that I stick by my beliefs,
and I believe in animal rights.

124
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:59,392
Fran, a mink is not an animal.
It's a rodent.

125
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:05,390
If it was up in the attic, you would
be the first one to call Terminex.

126
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:10,492
Ma, knock it off. I'm not putting
a dead animal anywhere near me.

127
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:13,602
Pass the tongue.

128
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:17,911
Fran, you're keeping the coat.
/ No, I'm not.

129
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:21,048
And do we have to discuss this
in front of everyone?

130
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:23,685
No, we'll discuss it in there.
/ Fine.

131
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:26,737
Excuse us.

132
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:30,520
They don't want to talk in front of us.

133
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,817
How could you turn your back on everything
that I raised you to believe in?

134
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:37,751
This is mink.

135
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:41,612
Ma, if you love the mink so much,
why don't you keep it?

136
00:10:41,612 --> 00:10:44,169
I'm too busty.

137
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:48,337
Didn't stop you from wearing
a tube top to Temple.

138
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:54,881
It's reform.

139
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:58,039
Ma, forget it.
I'm not taking the coat.

140
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,366
You know, you're killing
me with this.

141
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:05,626
If I die tonight,
you'll never forgive yourself.

142
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:09,990
Ma, I'm a grown woman. You can't use
guilt on me anymore to get what you want.

143
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,669
Oh! / What's the matter, Ma?

144
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:18,767
Nothing. I just hope I'm not getting
that weird flesh-eating disease.

145
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:29,448
We couldn't hear.

146
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,244
Niles ... / Huh?

147
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:40,276
Did my mother call? / Well, I'm not sure.
There was one call —

148
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:46,776
a sob, a sigh, and
a long plaintive oy ...

149
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:54,349
Well, either that's her or AT & T is really
depressed that we switched to Sprint.

150
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:58,542
I can't believe she would stoop
to crank guilt calls.

151
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:04,511
How low can she go? / Hey, you're talking
about a woman that could grow a tumor on command.

152
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:09,368
Ha, ha, ha. Excuse me.
/ Well, it's not going to work.

153
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:12,377
I'm a grown woman.
I'm entitled to my own opinions,

154
00:12:12,377 --> 00:12:17,042
and no silent treatment is going to
make me compromise my ideals.

155
00:12:17,042 --> 00:12:21,609
That coat is staying in Queens.
/ Thank you.

156
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:26,872
Oh, can you believe her. Didn't she hear
a word I said? I don't want this disgusting

157
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:33,327
soft, lush, plush — oh, Niles,
did you see the satin lining?

158
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:36,877
Boy, they don't make them like that anymore.
/ Well, it does become you, Miss Fine.

159
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:43,022
Oh, no, Niles, it's absolutely
repulsive. I can't stand it.

160
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:46,861
Up or down. Oh, take it off me.
Take it off.

161
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:51,733
Oh, look, at the initials,
M.F., Mema Fager —

162
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:55,608
Miss Fine, like it was meant to be.

163
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,280
Well, you could always send
it to Morgan Freeman.

164
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:06,345
Oh, Mema. It smells just like her,
Chalimar and stuffed cabbage?

165
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:10,449
I remember when I was a little girl in the winter.
She would bundle me up in her coat with her,

166
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:16,384
her bosoms right on top of my head.
My ears never got cold.

167
00:13:16,384 --> 00:13:23,915
I looked like Princess Laya until
Mema got older. Then I looked like Goofy.

168
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:28,355
Funny, as a lad, I don't ever recall
wearing bosoms as a hat.

169
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:33,180
Although, once at a butlers' convention —
/ Don't take me there, Niles.

170
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:37,870
Oh, my God. Fran, what is
that dead animal? / Where? Where?

171
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:43,670
On your back. / Oh, this.
Oh, I inherited this, but I refused to accept it.

172
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,572
Then why are you wearing it?

173
00:13:45,572 --> 00:13:49,291
Ah, I'm just indulging Niles.
He wanted to see me in it.

174
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:52,944
All right, already, are you happy?
Can I take it off? Geez.

175
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:59,128
Niles, I'm surprised at you.
/ Oh, forgive me, Miss Margaret.
I'm such a beast

176
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:07,658
Good morning, everyone ... But Dad.

177
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,252
Niles, thank you so much for buying glass
bottles instead of plastic ones at the market.

178
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:18,004
My pleasure, Miss Margaret. I've always
wanted to know what a hernia felt like.

179
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,094
Aren't you joining us, Maggie?
/ Oh, no.

180
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:26,806
While you leisurely sit here and eat, hundreds
of acres of rain forest are being destroyed.

181
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:29,540
So you're taking your croissant
back to the biosphere.

182
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,595
Sit down, Margaret.

183
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,447
Hello, hello.
/ Oh, Cee Cee, care to join us?

184
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:39,356
Well, is there enough?
/ No. / Niles ...

185
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:44,606
Well, it's just that you know how
I feel about her eating inside.

186
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:49,765
What was that? / I asked what
she would like on the side.

187
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:53,438
Bacon, sausage, Mighty Dog?

188
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,821
Whoa!

189
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:06,614
Oh, it's so nice sitting here with
all of you. I feel like part of the family.

190
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:09,510
Good morning, Stacy.

191
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:12,762
Gracie.
/ Thank you ...

192
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,686
Brighten.

193
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:21,280
So, kids, what's new?
/ Miss Fine's having a baby.

194
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,486
What?
/ Who's the father?

195
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:27,141
Why, Mr. Sheffield of course.

196
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,643
Miss Fine, what on earth is all
this about you being pregnant?

197
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:36,849
Pregnant? Me?
Oh, that's impossible.

198
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:40,531
Well, it's not impossible.

199
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:43,514
Oh, yeah, it's impossible.

200
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:49,057
Miss Fine and Mr. Sheffield are hamsters.
/ Oh, I knew I left something out.

201
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:52,028
Oh, please, no animals in the dining room.

202
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:58,065
I will be in the office. / Oh, very good, sir.
Usually, I have to tug at her leash.

203
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:02,565
Niles, has my mother called yet?
/ No, I'm afraid not.

204
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:08,474
Oh, Miss Fine, why don't you just take
the blasted coat and have done with it. / No ...

205
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:11,536
Why can't Fran have an opinion
different than her mother's.

206
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:14,807
Children should have the right to make
their own decisions and live their own lives.

207
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,752
You can have any opinion you like, Maggie,

208
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:22,313
just don't have it in the park
after dark with Mark. Oh, there's your poetry.

209
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:25,365
Now you don't have to go.
/ Oh ...

210
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:29,452
Oh, come on, Miss Fine, how'd you
make up with your mother in the past?

211
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:31,206
Well, when I was a little girl,

212
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:35,975
I would put a napkin on my head
and sing "Sunrise, Sunset."

213
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:42,271
At eight it's adorable. At 30,
they're giving you 3,000 units of Thorazine.

214
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:44,070
Well, if there's anything I can do.

215
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,061
Well, now that you mention it,
couldn't you talk to her, please.

216
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:51,334
I man you're so handsome, diplomatic.

217
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:54,996
What does that have to do with anything?
/ Well, my mother responds to good looks.

218
00:16:54,996 --> 00:17:00,195
She always said you reminded her of
Dave from Alvin and the Chipmunks.

219
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:04,213
The cartoon? / Yeah. She had
a thing for George Jetson too,

220
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:07,581
but he's a little more goyish.

221
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:15,862
Oh, Niles, isn't Mr. Sheffield a doll for going to
all the trouble of inviting my mother here for dinner?

222
00:17:15,862 --> 00:17:19,746
Yes. He's really knocked himself out.

223
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:23,615
Did you stock the bar?
/ Yes, Miss Fine, we have Chevitz, Pins, Schnider

224
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:26,357
— what does Sylvia like to drink?
/ Diet Slice.

225
00:17:26,357 --> 00:17:31,759
Oh, will Fresca do? / No, it doesn't
have to the zest of lime in it.

226
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,651
Fine, now I'm going to have to go out ...
Hi. / Oh, Miss Fine.

227
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:38,669
Oh, this should be
an interesting dinner, sir.

228
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:42,001
Miss Fine and her mother not speaking,
Miss Margaret not speaking to you.

229
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:47,850
That will leave the bulk of the conversation
to you and Sylvia. / Oh, good God.

230
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,313
Well, perhaps you can swap stories.
You can tell her how you started in the theater,

231
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:55,477
and she can tell you how
she removes unwanted hair.

232
00:17:55,477 --> 00:17:57,308
For heaven sakes, we've got to
get someone else for dinner.

233
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:00,123
Well, it is Saturday night, sir,
and most people do have a life.

234
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:03,432
Well, I'm off.
/ Ha, ha, ha, ha.

235
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,562
Cee Cee, by any chance are
you free tonight?

236
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:10,468
No. I have to pick up
my grandfather from the airport.

237
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:16,149
Old thing's in wheelchair with
a respirator — why?

238
00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:19,816
Well, I was just wondering if you'd care
to join me for dinner? / Done. Love too.

239
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:22,642
What about, what about your grandfather?
/ Oh, he'll get a sky cap.

240
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:26,135
He's loaded. He'll put a 20
in his mouth and wave it.

241
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:29,110
No, no. I just can't do this.
/ Oh, no, no, no, Maxwell.
It's not a problem.

242
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,660
The old guy's in a wheelchair.
It's downhill from La Guardia.

243
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,872
No, you see, it won't be just us.
I'm afraid Miss Fine and her mother will be there.

244
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:39,774
Oh, I hate that woman.

245
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:42,688
Which one? / Pick.

246
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:48,230
Really? Sylvia's always saying what a beautiful,
charming, sophisticated woman of the world you are.

247
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,982
Really? Those were her exact words?

248
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:55,494
Oh, that reminds me. I have to get
the name of your manicurist.

249
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:59,198
Sylvia's always going on about
how beautifully young your hands look.

250
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,748
I've always adored Syl.

251
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:04,674
But if you have a more pressing engagement,
then of course — / Forget about gramps.

252
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:07,924
I'll call the airline. They'll stick
him where they put the skis.

253
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:14,313
Niles, another place sitting on the table
and make it right next to my pal Syl.

254
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:18,156
Get the name of your manicurist indeed.

255
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,690
I learned from the master.
/ Yeah, well ...

256
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:26,680
Aren't my hamsters cute? We named
the babies Maggie, Brighten, and Grace.

257
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,047
There was a Cee Cee,
but Miss Fine ate her.

258
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:35,741
Isn't that adorable.

259
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:39,173
The kid collects vermin.

260
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:43,478
Syl ... Is that you?

261
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:46,961
Yeah. I was invited.

262
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:50,774
Shame on you girl friend.

263
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,893
Why haven't we done lunch?

264
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:59,826
Because when you saw me eat a chicken,
you had to take an Advil.

265
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:03,260
Oh, hi, Ma. What a nice surprise.

266
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,432
Gee, I didn't know
Mr. Sheffield invited you for dinner.

267
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:11,310
You want a diet Slice?
/ No, thanks. It gases me up.

268
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,623
Come on, sisealla.

269
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:20,930
Oh, this ring is stunning.
/ My aunt gave it to me.

270
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:23,264
Oh, it's a family heirloom.

271
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:28,582
How nice of you to not throw it
back in your aunt's face.

272
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:33,060
Ma, would you cut me some slack?
/ Why won't you wear a stinking coat.

273
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,812
You watch your tone of voice, young lady.
/ Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

274
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:41,467
Not you, Ma.
He's talking to Maggie.

275
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:44,683
Maggie does nothing.
She's a good daughter.

276
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:48,012
And what am I? Patty Davis?

277
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:52,579
This is just like when you refused
the mother-daughter kaftans that I bought us.

278
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:55,258
Six years old and a turban?

279
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:58,045
That's it. I wash my hands of you.

280
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:01,821
Oh, Mr. Sheffield. / Oh, oh, she's getting away.
Niles, the napkin. / No. Oh, no.

281
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:05,244
Yes, Miss Fine, yes, yes.
/ Oh, no, no, no.

282
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:11,196
"Is this the little girl I carried?"

283
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:17,477
Fran, that's not fair.
/ "Is this the little boy at play?"

284
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:24,148
Bomb, boom, bomb.
/ "I don't remember growing older."

285
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:29,170
"When did they?"

286
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:34,104
Oh, Fran, I'm sorry.
/ I'm sorry too, Mom.

287
00:21:34,104 --> 00:21:37,375
Oh, Syl ...

288
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:40,356
Oh, please, it's over.

289
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:43,052
Miss Babcock TWA is on the phone.

290
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:47,872
It seems there's an unclaimed elderly
gentleman on Carrousel 5. / Oh ...

291
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:52,143
Oh, Ma, I don't want to fight anymore.

292
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:56,929
Me neither. It's just such
an honor that Mema chose you.

293
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,406
She came to this country
with nothing.

294
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:01,946
She worked, she sacrificed.

295
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,362
This coat symbolizes
the struggles of our family.

296
00:22:06,362 --> 00:22:10,895
Ma, she won it
on the "Price is Right."

297
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:14,670
Fran, you should keep the coat.

298
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,202
After all, you're the one who always
says family comes first.

299
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:21,622
Oh, all right. I'll keep the coat.

300
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:24,744
Oh, I never thought
I'd hear you say those words.

301
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:28,238
But just in case,
I got it right here.

302
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:30,470
Oh, but I can't wear it.

303
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,337
All right, maybe just around
my Cousin Marsha

304
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:39,127
because it will kill her, and then
at least the minks won't have died in vain.

305
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:43,615
And, Dad, as important as
this poetry meeting is to me,

306
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:49,269
if you really don't want me to go,
then I'll respect your decision.

307
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:53,374
I really don't want you to go.
/ Why not?

308
00:22:54,748 --> 00:23:00,476
That is the most beautiful coat
I have ever seen.

309
00:23:00,476 --> 00:23:02,920
I'll give you $10,000 for it right now.

310
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,367
Oh, no, I'm sorry. This coat —
/ Looks better on a blond.
