1
00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:03,732
My teacher told us about
the comet that hit Jupiter.

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:06,664
It exploded like
a million atom bombs.

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:10,149
That couldn't happen
to earth, could it?

4
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,549
Didn't you hear?

5
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:19,914
Well, next year
around your birthday,

6
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:23,145
this giant comet
will obliterate us.

7
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:26,237
Why do you think
we're living like this?

8
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:29,512
Dad's spending all
his money because...

9
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:32,528
we're all going to die.

10
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:37,510
Hello, sweetheart.

11
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:42,886
Boy, your sister's in good
voice today. How's it going?

12
00:00:42,886 --> 00:00:45,045
Same old, same old.

13
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,713
Ma, get out of the taxi.

14
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:50,409
It's a spring in the dog's neck.

15
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:53,484
What are you so fascinated about?

16
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:58,079
Yi, Leave me alone. I like to
sing along in the theather.

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,389
Ma, it wasn't a musical.

18
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:03,851
Oh, you should have seen her
in "Shindler's List."

19
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:08,023
She was snapping her fingers and
singing away, "Papa, can you hear me?"

20
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:13,328
Meanwhile, the show in my head was
better than that crap we just saw.

21
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:17,713
So how was the theater, ladies?
/ Wonderful.

22
00:01:17,713 --> 00:01:22,063
Thank you for the tickets.
/ Meanwhile, my feet are killing me.

23
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:25,799
Ma, those aren't your shows.

24
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,621
Oh, I kicked off my shoes
in the theater.

25
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:32,143
These must be the lady's
sitting next to me.

26
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,821
And you just put them on?
You don't even look down?

27
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:39,975
Sweetheart, I haven't seen
my feet in 20 years.

28
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,374
Whose rain coat is this?

29
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:49,430
Oh, I'll tell you, it's a miracle
we got to Blimpy's without them
throwing a net over us.

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,806
Come here, son. Give grandma a hug.

31
00:01:54,622 --> 00:01:56,956
Harder.

32
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:59,270
Squeeze me.

33
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,794
All right, Yetta, okay. You should
have seen her at Chip and Dales.

34
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:05,975
Her entire social security check
went down a G-string.

35
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:10,690
Well, lucrative as that sounds,
I really have to get back to work.

36
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:16,591
Oh, hi, kids. Look who I brought home
with me, Ma and you remember Grandma Yetta?

37
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:19,595
Hi.
/ My little pitzalaughs.

38
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:27,206
Oh, they're all their father.
They got nothing from you.

39
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:31,775
Ma, these are not Fran's children.
Fran doesn't have any children.

40
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:35,729
She's not married.
She's all alone.

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,524
Louder, mom, I don't think
they heard you in Uruguay.

42
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:51,678
Even the grapes?

43
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:01,158
Fran, she's gonna to drive me
to the looney bin.

44
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:04,912
I got news for you, Ma,
you're already there.

45
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:07,723
You guys argue a lot.
/ Oh, no, we don't, honey.

46
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:11,578
It's just that we're all so very different.
It's hard to believe we're from the same family.

47
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:14,730
Oh, wait a minute, Ma.
You got a little smutz over there.

48
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,768
Hold on. You got some mascara.

49
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:24,236
Hold it. Whose purse is this?

50
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:29,450
Let me see that.
/ Boy, today's your lucky day, Ma.

51
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,189
The purse matches the shoes.

52
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:35,595
Okay, kids, get ready for supper.
Say good-bye. / All right. Bye, everyone.

53
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:37,062
Bye.
/ Good-bye, my darling.

54
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:40,290
Nice kids. Meanwhile,
they don't say two words.

55
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,352
Who could get two words in with you?

56
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:45,826
Ma, don't wind me up.
/ Don't hit Nanna. What are you an animal?

57
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,264
Don't talk to your mother like that.

58
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:56,353
Well, all good things must
come to an end. Bye, Ma;

59
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,494
bye, Grandma Yetta.
We'll go to the theater again soon.

60
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:02,532
Maybe next time
you could pick up a hat.

61
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,394
Didn't you tell her?
/ What?

62
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:10,618
Sweetheart, they're tenting
the retirement home for termites.

63
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:15,848
Oh, fun. So you're going to go
stay with Ma? / Sort of.

64
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:20,531
Sort of like ultra-suede
is sort of washable

65
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,965
or sort of like you're
sort of a Size 8?

66
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:29,663
Well, I am in the United Kingdom.
/ Ma...

67
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:33,863
No. Sort of like maybe
she could sort of stay with you.

68
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:37,214
Here? Ma, why can't
she stay at your place?

69
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:40,310
No. I don't want to be
a burden on family.

70
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,880
These people I don't know.

71
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:38,238
Maxwell, have I ever told you how much
I love working out of the house?

72
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,841
I feel I belong here.

73
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,348
And the children are really
warming up to me.

74
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:47,796
Hello.

75
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:50,299
No, there's no Maggie here.
You have the wrong number.

76
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:55,440
Excuse me, Cee Cee.
My daughter, Maggie. / Oh...

77
00:05:56,341 --> 00:06:01,110
Hello. Oh, Greg, listen,
you do know Maggie has her own line, don't you?

78
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,676
Yeah, well, that's quite all right.

79
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,799
Well, I'm very glad you like her.

80
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,205
Yeah, and I'm thrilled
she drives you crazy.

81
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:12,633
Yeah, keep going Greg, and you'll
never see her again. Good-bye, Greg.

82
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,539
Knock, knock.
/ Yes, Miss Fine, what is it?

83
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,119
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you just gotta
indulge me here a minute.

84
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:24,770
You're not going to believe it. My grandmother's
retirement home is infested with termites,

85
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,889
and my mother came up with
the bright idea ...

86
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,722
get ready for a loo loo ...

87
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:36,711
that she should come stay
here with us. Ma ...

88
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:42,795
I know ... I know.
She's a borderline clepto.

89
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:47,356
We wouldn't have a candy dish
left in the house.

90
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:51,276
Oh, well, I'll go tell my mother
that she's not staying.

91
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:54,348
Well, at least we know
where she gets it.

92
00:06:57,296 --> 00:07:03,148
Well, you know, Miss Fine, sometimes
you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.

93
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:06,755
What's so funny, poking fun
at a little old lady?

94
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:10,712
What's that, that British humor
that nobody gets?

95
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:14,514
Well, Miss Fine, you, you just
said yourself she was a clepto.

96
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:18,200
Yeah, well, I'm allowed.
She's my clepto.

97
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,534
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you,
but can't she stay with your mother?

98
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:26,425
No. The big cats can't share a cage.

99
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:32,115
Don't back down, Maxwell. We don't need
some old crone running around the house.

100
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:35,660
Yes. We are crone heavy, sir.

101
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:41,386
Although with two, we'd have a set.

102
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:51,085
Never mind, Mr. Sheffield. I'll just take
her to one of those 24-hour markets,

103
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:54,150
let her squeeze fruit
for a couple of days.

104
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,357
All right, look, Miss Fine. I'll,
I'll put her up at the St. Regis Hotel.

105
00:07:57,357 --> 00:08:00,986
How's that, huh? She'll have room service,
everything, fit for a queen.

106
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:05,100
You can't insult family like that.

107
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,206
Me you can send, I got thick skin.

108
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:12,914
Besides, I think that it's good for children
to spend time with their grandmother.

109
00:08:12,914 --> 00:08:14,955
She's not their grandmother.

110
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:20,321
Oh, all right. You tell her.
She stays alone like a dog in that home.

111
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,444
Fine. Let her stay.
As a matter of fact,

112
00:08:24,444 --> 00:08:27,525
I want her to stay.
She can have the master bedroom.

113
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:33,230
Oh, no. With that marble tub, she'll slip,
break her hip, you'll have a lawsuit on your hands.

114
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,946
Miss Fine!

115
00:08:35,946 --> 00:08:38,819
Oh, thank you, Mr. Sheffield,
Thank you so much.

116
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:42,323
And I promise you won't even
know that she's here.

117
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,752
Franny, can I sit outside in
my brassiere? Will anyone see?

118
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:14,893
Miss Fine, are you aware of this?

119
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:18,400
Yeah, "Body Heat," with William Hurt
and Kathleen Turner,

120
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,097
before her little side trip
to Pepperidge Farm.

121
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:24,942
Maggie is only 15 years old.

122
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:27,696
She's much too young to be
watching movies this racy.

123
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:32,685
Oh, you call this racy? You obviously never
saw "The Postman Always Rings Twice."

124
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:37,419
Oh, when he cleared
that table, hoooha.

125
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:40,724
Where is she anyway?

126
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:43,702
I mean is she ever coming back from
this date, or has she just moved out?

127
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:46,149
Relax. She's been back for an hour.

128
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:47,691
Oh, really?
I didn't hear her come in.

129
00:09:47,691 --> 00:09:50,430
Well, I didn't say she came in.

130
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:55,163
Leave them alone. Leave them alone.

131
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:56,232
What are they doing?

132
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:58,783
Nothing, nothing,
all four hands are visible.

133
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:03,324
One, two, three ... here comes four.
Here comes four.

134
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:06,487
How much time does he need already?
They just went on the date for heaven sakes.

135
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:11,259
He's not leaving for the Crimean War.
/ Oh, Mr. Sheffield.

136
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,977
Hello, children.
Good-bye, Greg.

137
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:20,086
I can't believe you did that.
I have never been so embarrassed in my life.

138
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,528
Oh, really? Not even when
you were watching "Body Heat"?

139
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:32,023
You went in my room?
Have you ever heard of privacy?

140
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:34,344
How would you like it if
I went through your stuff?

141
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:37,941
Oh, don't bother.
He locks everything.

142
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:44,185
I don't ever want you
seeing that boy again.

143
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,600
You can't stop me. / Oh, oh, oh.
Watch this. You're grounded.

144
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,616
I hate you. / Well, that's tough.

145
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,792
You forgot to stick your tongue out.
/ Well, you might have backed me up a little.

146
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:57,423
Me? The Pips can't back you up.

147
00:10:58,585 --> 00:11:01,998
What's all the commotion?
/ He went through my things.

148
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:06,116
Oh, honey, I know just how you feel.

149
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:12,817
At the home, they ransack your room two,
three times a month looking for cake.

150
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,478
Come, we'll talk. Don't fight
in front of the kids. / Ow!

151
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,440
Ow!

152
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,468
See how sensitive Yetta is.
She'll be a great influence on Maggie.

153
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,454
You want a cigarette?

154
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:38,212
Good morning, Niles.
/ Uh-huh.

155
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,917
What's the matter with you?

156
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:43,466
Oh, it's very disturbing to see
Mr. Sheffield and Miss Margaret fight.

157
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:48,277
Oh, that was a fight? I hate you,
who cares, and, now.

158
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:54,218
In my house the fight ain't over until
the fat lady grabs the ginzo and says,
"Here, cut my heart out."

159
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:57,276
We never say a cross word
in our family.

160
00:11:57,276 --> 00:12:01,721
We just die very early
of colon disorders.

161
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,821
Good morning, everyone.
/ Good morning.

162
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,800
Niles, tea.

163
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:12,761
What on earth is that?

164
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:16,880
Grandma Yetta says this tea bag still
has seven cups left in it.

165
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:20,112
My Bubba Yetta doesn't
like to waste anything.

166
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:23,512
If food is moldy, it's a vaccine.
Ha, ha.

167
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:30,835
Oh, come on, lighten up. You going to be
this way when Maggie comes down?

168
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:33,051
If I ever talked to my father
the way she talked to me,

169
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:37,158
I'd have been throttled within an inch of
my life and thrown in the root cellar.

170
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:41,640
Why do you always have to take
me to Oliver Twist land?

171
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,931
Do you know how many times
I told my father I hated him?

172
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,419
Yeah. And how did he react?
/ Oh, who the hell knows.

173
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:52,446
He couldn't hear a damn thing over
that Bonanza theme blasting in the background.

174
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,334
Good morning, Margaret.

175
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:01,566
Daddy, I'm sorry
I said I hated you.

176
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:05,166
Bubba Yetta said you only have
one father, and she's right.

177
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,042
Well, I'm sorry too.

178
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:11,061
And you were going to tell her
that she's not grounded anymore.

179
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:13,833
You almost forgot that part.

180
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:17,709
Ah, yes, I was going to say that.
What she said.

181
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:20,951
Well, Miss Fine, it seems
I underestimated your booby.

182
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:28,989
That's bubby. No one's ever
underestimated my booby.

183
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:34,146
You know, Dad,
it's a real pretty day.

184
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,995
Greg asked if I could go
on a picnic. May I?

185
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:39,210
Well, Margaret, I don't think ...

186
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,250
that sounds like a good idea.

187
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,981
So long as you're back by 6:00 ...
7:00 ... 8:00 ...

188
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:49,542
Thanks, guys.

189
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:53,947
Have a wonderful time and don't do
anything that I forgot I did.

190
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,114
Oh, don't worry. I had a long
conversation with Yetta. / Good.

191
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,270
You know, Yetta turned out
to be pretty cool.

192
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,941
You know, she gave me a hundred
bucks for my bar mitzvah.

193
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:10,930
Of course she also thinks
my name is Smuey.

194
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:15,210
Something smells.
/ Just eat it.

195
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:18,663
No. Like something's burning.

196
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:23,012
Seems to be coming from upstairs.
/ Oh, my God. Yetta.

197
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:28,758
I can't believe she would be smoking in bed,
not after that Circle 7 motel went up in ...

198
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:33,673
never mind.
/ Yetta, Yetta, stand back.

199
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:34,404
Oh ...

200
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:48,538
Ah. Well, I was right.
She was smoking.

201
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:56,129
Oh, my God. Yetta ...

202
00:14:56,336 --> 00:15:01,971
What a coincidence. Saul said
the same thing not ten minutes ago.

203
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:08,530
What the devil's burning?
/ Oh, God.

204
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,002
Oh, Saul, I ruined your bagel.

205
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:13,210
Oh, no, no.

206
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:16,980
You can just scrape off the top.
It's still good.

207
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,570
Miss Fine. / What did you
do with all the cream cheese?

208
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:29,277
Thank you, Miss Fine.

209
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:33,149
Thank you for bringing
this influence into my home.

210
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:38,330
Well, you know, Mr. Sheffield, it's really
kind of sweet if you think about it...

211
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:41,549
Are you out of your mind?

212
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:46,975
This is the Sheffield home.
No one ever has sex in this house.

213
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,324
This, this is the woman you let give
my daughter advice about sex?

214
00:15:55,324 --> 00:15:59,169
Well, at least you know
the advice was current.

215
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:02,979
Margaret ...
/ Oh, Miss Margaret just left, sir.

216
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:06,510
Oh, good morning, Ms. Rosenberg,
Mr. Kanazel.

217
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,714
What? You knew about this?
/ Yes. My room is directly beneath theirs...

218
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:14,558
Bravo...

219
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:25,526
I, I just can't believe
I gave Maggie permission to go.

220
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:29,368
She's just a little girl.
/ Well, now, don't get all upset.

221
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:32,139
We don't know what Yetta told her.

222
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,366
Told who?
/ Maggie.

223
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:38,132
I told her we could all die
tomorrow. Go for it.

224
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,445
Go for it?
/ All right. Now you could be upset.

225
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,253
I hold you completely
responsible for this.

226
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:50,145
Why? What did I do?
/ She's your grandmother.

227
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:53,692
Oh, we don't know that for sure.
Some woman comes walking out of Europe

228
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:58,918
with a dining room table strapped to her back.
She could be anybody's relative.

229
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:02,050
What?

230
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:09,027
Good night, Niles.
/ It is now.

231
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:15,053
Oh, Niles, dear sweet pompous Niles.

232
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:18,435
Maxwell and Nanny Fine are on the outs,
and there is nothing

233
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:23,276
you can say to ruin
this glorious feeling I have.

234
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,738
You want a bet?

235
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:35,372
Grandma Yetta, aged 80,

236
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:41,211
living in a home, got a heap of
good loving last night.

237
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,896
And you?

238
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,500
I hate my life.

239
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,744
Thank you.

240
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:07,083
Niles.
/ Oh, the coast is clear, Miss Fine.

241
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:11,385
Oh, boy, here she is now.
Devil with the blue hair on.

242
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,265
What? What? What? What? What?
/ Franny,

243
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:19,125
you left your wallet right
on top of your dresser. / So?

244
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,578
Thank you.

245
00:18:23,578 --> 00:18:26,504
Franny, I know
it's none of my business.

246
00:18:26,504 --> 00:18:33,996
But it might help your marriage if you
got rid of that blond your husband's
always hanging around with.

247
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:38,542
I don't know if you noticed,
but your kids are blond.

248
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:43,294
They're not my kids.
He's not my husband.

249
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,940
Oy, she couldn't have spaced out
like this with Mr. Sheffield.

250
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,491
No, with him, she could recall
things from the womb.

251
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:52,867
All I'm saying is that
a blond like that

252
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:57,183
with big shoulder pads dragged
off your grandfather.

253
00:18:57,183 --> 00:19:00,441
That was a Cossack.

254
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:07,700
Hi, Grandma Yetta.
/ Oh, come here, angel puss.

255
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,062
So, how was your day?

256
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:14,764
Great. I'm not worried
about the end of the world.

257
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:17,867
I'm going to live life to the fullest.
/ That a girl.

258
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:21,261
What did I tell you?
/ Go for it.

259
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,162
Go for it? I thought you
told that to Maggie?

260
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:29,868
That's not Maggie?
/ No. That's grace.

261
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:32,771
Now I'm confused.

262
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:37,444
Grace is the little one;
Smuey is the boy;

263
00:19:38,284 --> 00:19:41,127
and the tall one is Maggie.

264
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:44,564
Hot pants? Tell her to go for it?

265
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:49,874
What am I, senile? Your husband
would throw me out of the house.

266
00:19:52,211 --> 00:19:55,204
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, here you are.

267
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:57,635
What are you doing out here?
Waiting for Maggie?

268
00:19:57,635 --> 00:20:01,140
No. I just have a game of stoop
ball in five minutes.

269
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,536
Where is she?
/ Well, I've got good news for you.

270
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:09,161
Remember when we thought that Grandma Yetta
told her to go for it with Greg? / Yeah.

271
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:12,450
Well, we were wrong.
/ Oh, thank God.

272
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,219
She told Gracie.
/ Oh, much better. She's only seven.

273
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:19,989
And here I thought
the woman was a kook.

274
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,235
Anyhow, Margaret still isn't home.

275
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:28,026
Well, you know, it was a picnic.
These things have to go at their own flow.

276
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,353
You have to eat. Then my mother always
says you have to wait at least an hour

277
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:35,566
before you do strenuous physical
activity ... like Frisbee.

278
00:20:36,076 --> 00:20:39,218
Please, Miss Fine,
I'm just not in the mood.

279
00:20:39,218 --> 00:20:43,061
Gee, no man's ever said
that to me before.

280
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:48,636
Although I'm sure Lisa Marie is
getting an ear full of it.

281
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:58,276
Come on, Mr. Sheffield, has Maggie ever
given you a reason not to trust her?

282
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:01,340
Yes. And they all coincided
with your arrival.

283
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,133
Suddenly she wants to go kissing boys and
going off to parties and concerts and things.

284
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:09,140
Who does she think she is?
A teenage girl?

285
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,972
Um, oh, Miss Fine, I'm her father.
I just want to protect her.

286
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,923
I know. But sometimes you're just
going to have to sit on your hands

287
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:22,348
and let them grow up.
/ What if she grows up wrong?

288
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:26,352
Well, you've still got Smuey
and the little one.

289
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:31,018
Come on, Mr. Sheffield.
Don't be her enemy.

290
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:34,313
Oh, no, of course not.
That's the last thing I want to do.

291
00:21:34,313 --> 00:21:36,763
Thanks, Greg.
/ She's home.

292
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:40,690
How long does it take a picnic, huh ...
/ Oh, now, now, now. You see,

293
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,949
you're getting
all wound up again.

294
00:21:42,949 --> 00:21:46,328
Just calm down. Don't let her
think that you were worried.

295
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:49,309
In fact, why don't you just go upstairs.
Go ahead. / But I ...

296
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,349
I'll be up in a minute.
Trust is a good thing.

297
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,666
Trust is character building.

298
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,333
Go ahead. I'll take care of everything.

299
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,269
Everything's fine...

300
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:03,301
Where the hell have you been?
Do you know what time it is?

301
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:06,452
Your father was so worried,
I had to send him to bed.

302
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:09,554
Fran, we didn't do anything.
Greg and I decided to cool it.

303
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:12,561
Why? I mean, good.

304
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:14,938
I'm just not ready yet.

305
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:18,607
Besides, do you think I'd get into any serious
stuff without talking to you first?

306
00:22:18,607 --> 00:22:20,679
Oh, well, I thought
you talked to Yetta.

307
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,209
Yetta? Please, I zoned out
somewhere around buying a cow

308
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:28,724
and you can get the milk for free.
/ Oh, yep, yep, yep. That sounds like her.

309
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:33,195
Well, it should take you a good long
while to get that image out of your head.

310
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:38,902
And in the meantime, let me tell you something
that's a little more hip and a little more happening.

311
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:42,348
Don't do a thing
if you ain't got that ring.

312
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:44,606
Doowap, doowap, doowap.

313
00:22:56,191 --> 00:23:01,424
Oh, I just love that Mike Meyers
doing that coffee-talk thing.

314
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:08,217
That clip lady is so funny.

315
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,776
Oh, please. Who talks like that?

316
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,700
And that big hair ...

317
00:23:20,437 --> 00:23:24,105
I think it's very stereo typical.
