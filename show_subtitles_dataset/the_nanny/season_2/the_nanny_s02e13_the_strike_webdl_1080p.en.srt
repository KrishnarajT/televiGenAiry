3
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:05,371
Morning, Niles.

4
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:09,570
God save the queen.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,298
I don't look too much
like a roll of Lifesavers?

6
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:17,094
Yes. But the flavor
goes on and on.

7
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:21,611
Oh, Niles, it's always
the quiet ones.

8
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:24,935
I want to wear this to
Mr. Sheffield's big opening night,

9
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:27,987
but I gotta practice
sitting in it.

10
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:30,525
Whoa!

11
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:34,478
That looks natural.

12
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:38,066
Well, maybe if I sat on the aisle?

13
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,842
Oh, oh, thanks.

14
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:44,492
Well, here it is a full-page
ad in today's paper.

15
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:46,387
"Opening tonight 'Norma,'

16
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:50,099
a musical adaptation of Norma Rae,
produced by Maxwell Sheffield

17
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:54,963
and Cee Cee Boopcock?"
/ Boopcock?

18
00:00:54,963 --> 00:01:01,816
I proofread this ad copy myself, and then
I gave it to Niles to send to the messenger ...

19
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:05,135
Oh, how embarrassing.

20
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:09,282
Someone at that ad agency
must have it in for you.

21
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,467
Oh, who would have thought
that I would love a musical

22
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:16,946
about a union organizer sorely
in need of dress shields,

23
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:22,048
but I'll tell you, I'm still humming
the sweat shop number.

24
00:01:23,064 --> 00:01:26,508
Uh-huh. So Niles, you haven't told me
what you thought of the preview.

25
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:28,253
Oh, it was wonderful, sir.

26
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:32,846
Those three hours and fifteen minutes
flew by like three hours and ten.

27
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:36,457
And what a novel idea not
to have an intermission.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,279
Yes, thank you. I'm,
I'm very proud of the show.

29
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:44,402
Well, you should be. I know my whole
family is going to see it.

30
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:49,215
We're union workers from way back.
My Aunt Tessie was all-blouse.

31
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:52,404
What's all-blouse?
/ You know, from the commercial.

32
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,751
"Look for the union label

33
00:01:55,751 --> 00:02:00,639
when you are buying a coat,
dress, or blouse."

34
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:04,261
Yes, well, let's all break
a leg tonight, shall we?

35
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:07,087
Oh, you won't need luck,
Mr. Sheffield,

36
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:11,279
not with the hit play you've got
on your hands, Mister.

37
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,991
Niles, I'm not kissing up.
It's a very important play.

38
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:22,963
If I don't sit through it again,
how am I going to get to the party?

39
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:25,319
Come on. Don't you want to hobnob
with some celebrities?

40
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,973
Miss Fine, I've been to scores of these
and as yet, no one has hobbed my nobs.

41
00:02:32,028 --> 00:02:36,753
Well, maybe you should try wearing
something a little more low cut.

42
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:27,108
Fran, what do you think
about this one?

43
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:33,726
Oh, honey, that is entirely
too revealing.

44
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:36,570
No, no, no. It makes
you look cheap and taudry.

45
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,706
Go put it back in my closet.

46
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,542
Fran, Brighten says he can see up
my dress when I wear my Mary Janes.

47
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:48,366
Oh, sweetie, don't listen to him.

48
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:51,029
They make you look
very lucky.

49
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:54,808
Oh, I see you're wearing the
new Barbie underpants I bought you.

50
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:02,329
Say, Fran, can I go to that new mall in Jersey
with with Kyle and a couple of guys?

51
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,519
Which Kyle? The one with the braces
or the one that smells like cheese?

52
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,170
Cheese.
/ Oh, good. The other one's weird.

53
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:12,722
How you going to get there?
/ His brother's driving.

54
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:15,550
How long has he had his license?
/ A while.

55
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:21,053
A while ten years or a while he still
looks like the picture on his license?

56
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:24,541
Oh, "B," I don't think so.
I don't want you getting into a car

57
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:30,047
with a bunch of boys that just drive fast
and act fresh, and then the next thing you know,

58
00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:35,922
you're hitchhiking on the Jersey turnpike
wearing much too much makeup for your age — oh.

59
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:43,534
I'm having a hypoglycemic attack.

60
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:46,191
I better have a Godiva.

61
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:51,222
Oh, cheer up, honey.
Hey, I've been to that mall.

62
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:54,974
They don't even have
a Judy's there.

63
00:04:54,974 --> 00:04:57,672
Besides, tonight's your father's
big opening night.

64
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:01,123
What if you got stuck in traffic?
Then you'd miss the whole thing.

65
00:05:01,123 --> 00:05:03,835
I'm not that lucky.

66
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:08,439
Hum, nugget.

67
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:18,502
Say, Dad, could I go to
the mall with Kyle?

68
00:05:18,502 --> 00:05:21,935
Well, I don't know.
What does Miss Fine say?

69
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:24,919
Well, you see, she was kind of
leaning towards no.

70
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,371
But between you and me, I think
she's just a little overprotective,

71
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:32,688
which is fine for the girls,
but sometimes a man needs to get away.

72
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,234
Maxwell ...

73
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:36,560
I know what you mean.

74
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,360
Well, all right.
Off you go, huh. Have fun.

75
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,348
Yes...

76
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:52,129
terday, all my troubles
seemed so far away.

77
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:56,399
Now it looks as though
they're here to stay.

78
00:05:56,609 --> 00:06:02,983
Well, the good news is "B,"
I'm usually a very fair nanny.

79
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:07,739
The bad news is it's
the 28th day of the month.

80
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:14,678
Niles, how long are you going to
polish that couch?

81
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,617
The fumes are rather overwhelming.

82
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:21,546
After a while,
you don't notice them, sir.

83
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:27,532
Oh, I couldn't resist
the infomercial.

84
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:31,332
"Unwanted dirt just
slides right off ..."

85
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,858
Voila!

86
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:48,728
Cheers. Must be five
o'clock somewhere.

87
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,819
I haven't been drinking,
Nanny Fine.

88
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,927
I just slid off the couch.

89
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:59,447
And Ted Kennedy's nose
is just sun damaged.

90
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:02,265
Mr. Sheffield, you got a second?
/ Yes.

91
00:07:02,265 --> 00:07:06,162
Well, Brighten — / Whoops!
Time's up. Good-bye, Nanny Fine.

92
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:09,648
Well, you're in a good mood.
Well, I'll take care of that.

93
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:15,060
Well, this sounds like a must miss.
I have to pick up my dress from the cleaners anyway.

94
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,406
Ohhhh!

95
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:22,779
It's also an excellent
floor polish.

96
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,113
All right, Miss Fine,
now what's all this about Brighten?

97
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,085
Well, we've got a little problem.

98
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,212
Brighten knew I didn't want
him to go to the mall.

99
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:33,898
So he used you to undermine me.

100
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:39,162
No. In all fairness, he made it
perfectly clear you'd already said no.

101
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:41,763
Oh, well, then I take it back.

102
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:45,370
We don't have a little problem.
We've got a big problem.

103
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,324
Miss Fine, don't you think you're
being just a bit overprotective?

104
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:53,312
It's a, it's a guy thing.

105
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:57,097
You know, I, I thought it was
appropriate to just let him go.

106
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:00,277
And just how did you think
he was getting to Jersey?

107
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:02,880
He's going to Jersey?

108
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,710
Just for the future,
Mr. Sheffield,

109
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,827
when the kids
say "Fran said, 'No,'

110
00:08:07,827 --> 00:08:12,654
" that's the big robot saying
danger Will Robinson."

111
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:18,271
You know, I could have
stayed in England.

112
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:23,895
I'll make it simple for you.
Children are like a brassiere.

113
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:28,083
One part of me says
get out the window quick.

114
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:32,369
But the other part just
has to know why.

115
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,488
Because they divide and separate.

116
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:42,257
Ahhh ... / Your mother
never told you that?

117
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:46,502
No. But we always thought mummy should
have talked more about her underwear.

118
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:53,419
My point is that you have to give me
full support. You must back me up no matter what.

119
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:57,568
All right, Miss Fine, I promise,
if you promise no brassiere analogies.

120
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:00,514
Cross my heart. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

121
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,772
I don't want to hear that you
don't want to go tonight.

122
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:10,376
That man works very hard to put
a roof over your head.

123
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:13,803
Now stop whining and go put
on your party clothes.

124
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,294
Oh, all right.

125
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,721
Don't give me that look.
/ What look?

126
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:24,890
Oh, the look of anticipation, sir.
It's only four hours till "Norma."

127
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,998
Try to hold on, man.

128
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:34,327
Do you smell cheese?

129
00:09:34,327 --> 00:09:36,299
Oh, that's Kyle.

130
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,107
All righty. I'm going to
the mall like you said.

131
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:42,547
I've changed my mind.
Brighten you're staying home.

132
00:09:42,547 --> 00:09:46,797
and when Miss Fine says
"No," it means no.

133
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:51,262
Good afternoon, monster —
ah, Master Kyle.

134
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:57,932
Dad, nothing's going to happen.
/ Look, I think I've made
myself perfectly clear.

135
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:01,157
Is someone making grilled cheese?

136
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:05,696
I think Kyle's just
a little overheated.

137
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:08,662
Take your coat off, honey.

138
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:12,526
Hello, I'm Peter Bidwall. I'll be
driving the boys to the mall.

139
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,639
You must be Mr. Sheffield.
/ Yes.

140
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,182
How do you do, sir? I saw
your last play. Brilliant.

141
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:22,096
Really? What was your favorite part?

142
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:26,284
Mr. Sheffield ... / Now, Miss Fine,
he seems like a perfectly responsible young man.

143
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:28,826
Yeah. Too bad that he's not
the one that's driving. / What?

144
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:32,380
I'll bet you dollars for donuts
that this kid is the decoy.

145
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,080
We used to send Bridgett O'Malley
in her parochial uniform to the door.

146
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,854
Meanwhile, behind the wheel
is sitting Debbie Cutler

147
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:42,295
burning her boyfriend's
initials in her forearm.

148
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,432
Watch and learn.

149
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:46,003
Lovely home you have here.

150
00:10:46,003 --> 00:10:49,767
Peter, I've never met you before.
Where do you go go school?

151
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:53,985
Um, right around the corner.
/ Oh ... Who are you studying with?

152
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:56,697
Hamagher or Schlemmer?

153
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:01,627
Ah, Schlemmer?

154
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:05,780
Okay. Where'd they dig you up from?

155
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,840
The Gap.

156
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:15,190
How much are they paying you?
/ Twenty.

157
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,545
Twenty? Boy, Bridgett used to do
it for a pack of Kents.

158
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:23,790
Well, you're busted, you guys.

159
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,242
Sorry, guys. No refunds.

160
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:31,963
Kyle, you paid him?

161
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:36,840
Well, if he's not driving,
then I'm not going. Get out.

162
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,235
Oh, man, that was close.

163
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,794
Brighten —
/ Allow, me, Miss Fine.

164
00:11:44,794 --> 00:11:47,794
Brighten, you are grounded.
/ Ha ...

165
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:51,309
And furthermore, you're not
going to the show tonight.

166
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:52,940
Ohhh,

167
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:58,125
but I've only seen that once.

168
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:02,433
You should have thought of
that before.

169
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:07,434
Oh, well.

170
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,356
Freeze!

171
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:12,702
Mr. Sheffield,

172
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,422
I think you're being just
a little too severe.

173
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:20,079
He's really a good boy.

174
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:24,119
No, I'm not.

175
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:27,691
I'm bad, very bad.

176
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:33,134
He wants to come with us
and see the play again.

177
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,133
All three acts.

178
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:41,507
Well ...
/ Oh, but I don't deserve it.

179
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:45,698
Oh, baby, you do.

180
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,646
You really do.

181
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:55,194
Mr. Sheffield? Another opening,
another shrimp joke.

182
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:04,737
Miss Fine, what were those two women
behind you complaining about?

183
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:08,838
Oh, who knows? Something
about not being able to see.

184
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:11,632
What do you think, Niles? Niles?

185
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:14,145
The Nicks are up by two.

186
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:17,195
Maxwell, the photographers want to
take a picture of us. / Oh ...

187
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:20,156
Go on, Nanny Fine, free shrimp.

188
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,205
You don't have to tell me twice

189
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:27,192
Mr. Sheffield, can we get
a photo of you and Miss Boopcock?

190
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:29,981
All right.
Not shall we?

191
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:37,313
Wait a minute.
Are the busboys on strike?

192
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:40,896
Oh, my God, those poor people.

193
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:44,070
Who's going to clear their tables?

194
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:47,132
Miss Fine, after you.

195
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:51,109
Mr. Sheffield, I can't go in there.
My mother had three rules:

196
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:54,966
Never make contact with a public toilet;

197
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,006
never ever ever cross
a picket line.

198
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:02,680
What was the third one? Oh, yeah.
Never wear Musk oil to zoo.

199
00:14:02,853 --> 00:14:05,100
Miss Fine, you're embarrassing me.
Now come along.

200
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,173
I can't. My my Aunt All-Blouse
would roll over in her grave,

201
00:14:09,173 --> 00:14:12,204
which was paid for by her union.

202
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:15,909
Now, will you please come in before
this turns into a spectacle? / No, no ...

203
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:21,270
No, I can't ... Stop it.
/ Would you let go, Miss Fine.
Would you please listen.

204
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:34,630
Oh, Niles, boy did I ruin
Mr. Sheffield's big night last night.

205
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,198
Well, you know what I'll do just
to defuse the situation?

206
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:44,426
I'll tell him how adorable he is,
compliment him on his accent.

207
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,513
And if that fails, I can always
turn on the tears.

208
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,769
He's a real sucker for crying.

209
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:55,620
Oh, hi, Niles / Hello.

210
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:03,006
Can you drop me off
at Unemployment?

211
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:06,240
Good morning, Miss Fine.
Entertainment section, please, Niles.

212
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,519
Oh, don't bother.
I've already scoured the paper.

213
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,982
I didn't see any mention of
our little incident.

214
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:17,189
It was a coupon?

215
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:20,509
Just imagine what this picture
would have look liked, huh?

216
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,960
Miss Fine!

217
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:25,417
How could you do it to me?

218
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,993
Well, I'm sorry. But the Fines
don't cross picket lines.

219
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:31,925
It's against our religion.
Like eating pork.

220
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:34,662
Well, you eat bacon.
/ No, I don't.

221
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:36,330
You most certainly do too.

222
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,694
All right. But only if it's very
crispy or in a club sandwich.

223
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:43,977
But don't ever tell my grandmother.
/ She eats it as well.

224
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,688
Oh, all right, we all do.

225
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:53,261
Mr. Sheffield, what part of England
do you come from?

226
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:56,295
You have such a gorgeous accent.

227
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:58,200
Miss Fine ...

228
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:02,104
Well, you don't understand anything.

229
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:06,718
Oh, I understand a lot
more than you think.

230
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:11,966
Oh, what's the use? You blue bloods
just don't know from us blue collars.

231
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:15,961
Oh, so now I don't appreciate
the plight of the working man, huh?

232
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:17,952
Look, I have a job.
/ Huh?

233
00:16:17,952 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm a working stiff,
just like the next guy.

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,321
Oh, Niles, what is this on my shoe?

235
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,469
Daddy, I need the limo. I have
a riding lesson after school.

236
00:16:28,469 --> 00:16:32,187
But I have a play date
with Ivanka Trunk.

237
00:16:32,476 --> 00:16:36,056
Well, one of you will just have to
take the Town Car, won't you?

238
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:40,990
There. See. We have problems
just like everyone else.

239
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,328
Maxwell, you are never going to
believe what happened.

240
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:47,300
There was a message on
your answering machine?

241
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,504
No, no. The box office does — no ...

242
00:16:51,504 --> 00:16:56,033
The box office doesn't open for a hour,
and there's already a line around the block,

243
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:59,098
and Sally Jesse Rafael wants us
on her show today.

244
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:01,912
Oh, I love her. She's the best.

245
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:07,320
You know, Oprah goes up and down,
but Sally maintains her ideal weight.

246
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,564
Cee Cee, Sally isn't inviting us to
chat up the show.

247
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,436
She just wants us to talk up
that bloody picket line incident.

248
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:18,020
Maxwell, Maxwell, Maxwell, she isn't
going to be the only one with a mike.

249
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,757
I will just paint Nanny Fine
as a disgruntled nut.

250
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:27,075
Disgruntled nut? That could work.

251
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:29,959
Well, maybe we should go. I suppose
I could try some damage control.

252
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:33,770
Maxwell, leave it to me.
I can fix anything.

253
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,753
You can fix anything? Cee Cee, there is
a billboard in Town Square that says "Boopcock."

254
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:44,880
Where's Steadman?

255
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,930
That's "Oprah." This is "Sally."
/ Oh.

256
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,718
Five, four, three, two ...

257
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:57,064
Well, today we have
the producers of "Norma,"

258
00:17:57,064 --> 00:18:02,284
which opened on Broadway yesterday
to rave reviews, I might add.

259
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:06,785
So I told you you were worried
about nothing.

260
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:12,846
Max, isn't it ironic that you are producing
a play that is pro-union

261
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:20,772
and yet you were photographed dragging an employee
across the picket line? / I know. I know.

262
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:26,089
Oh, would you look at
the size of that picture.

263
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:30,299
I wonder how much it would
cost to get that framed.

264
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,964
Well, Sally, first of all, I,
I want to go on record

265
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:40,240
as saying that "Norma" employs nearly
300 union members. / Oh, oh, oh ...

266
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:45,794
Nanny Fine is a disgruntled nut.

267
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:49,221
Oh, look, my name's on TV.

268
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:52,316
Well, look at who we have here.

269
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:56,578
Fran Fine, the nanny.
/ Hi, Sally.

270
00:18:56,578 --> 00:19:01,345
Why don't you join them on stage?
/ Oh, no, I couldn't —

271
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:05,083
oh, well, for the people.

272
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:10,029
Why don't you move over,
Miss Boopcock ...

273
00:19:15,142 --> 00:19:18,061
Max, did you know that
there was a strike?

274
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:19,932
Well, no, of course not, Sally.

275
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:23,208
But what was I supposed to do?
Everyone was already inside.

276
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,133
I mean, cast members,
celebrities, the press.

277
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:30,546
I called Beef Steak Charlies.
They don't have a booth for 312.

278
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:34,833
Wow! That's a lot of important people.
What did you expect him to do, Fran?

279
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:37,179
Fran? Fran?

280
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:45,557
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, you know,
I understood why he crossed the picket line.

281
00:19:45,557 --> 00:19:48,138
Why can't he understand
why I couldn't?

282
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:50,954
I, I thought we were supposed to back
each other up no matter what?

283
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:53,854
Oh, so I'm just supposed to play
along with everything you say?

284
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,913
Well, apparently I'm supposed to play
along with everything you say./ Now —

285
00:19:56,913 --> 00:20:02,067
Hold it folks. / What — Max, what are we
really talking about here? I mean in one word.

286
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:06,352
Support. / Good. Fran, in one word.

287
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:10,907
One word? Good bloody luck.

288
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:20,938
Hey, mister they had to turn the music
on to get you off the stage at the Tony Awards ...

289
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:29,248
Kids, Maxwell, will you at least concede
that perhaps you could have been a little bit

290
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:33,016
more sympathetic to Fran's feelings
on the picket line?

291
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:38,468
Well, I suppose I ...
maybe ... might?

292
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:50,970
I missed that, Sally. You're going
to have to send me a transcript.

293
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,470
Well, look,
it was a very important night for me.

294
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,335
You're important to me.
Ergo, I wanted you there.

295
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:59,620
Ergo? Who's ergo.

296
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,335
Sally, Sally ...
Look, look, girl friend,

297
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:09,925
didn't you hear what the man just said?
He said you're important to him.

298
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:14,920
Is that what you said?
/ Yes.

299
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:20,181
Well, why can't they just communicate?

300
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:25,728
You know, if we were running the world,
there'd be no wars; right, girls?

301
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,915
Right, right. Right. Because,

302
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:38,316
because there'd be so much bloody talk,
there'd be no time for the war;
isn't that true, gentleman?

303
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:42,881
Whoof! Whoof! Whoof!
Whoof! Whoof! Whoof!

304
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:47,185
Boy, that Sally is
one fantastic interviewer.

305
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:50,529
She gets things out of you that
you didn't even know were there.

306
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:55,666
That tax shelter where you hid all that money,
I don't know how that came out.

307
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,377
Well, well, it wasn't
a total disaster.

308
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:02,859
It seems our appearance shamed the hotel
into settling with the busboys.

309
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:07,389
Oh, that makes me feel good because,
you know, they work so hard,

310
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:11,284
and all they really needed was to be
treated with a little human dignity.

311
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:14,589
I thought you'd like that.
They settled for $8.00 an hour.

312
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:18,707
What? For bringing water that
you have to ask 16 times for,

313
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:21,599
and then they take your plate
before you're through.

314
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,492
Well, then, you know they're
eating it in the back.

315
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:29,680
Oh, Niles, we are going to have
to get organized. We're being exploited.

316
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,335
Amen! Would you like some fois gras?
/ Nah. I've had it up to here with Beluga.

317
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:37,692
Yes, life is tough, isn't it, folks?

318
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:40,782
He should only walk a mile in my shoes.

319
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:44,584
Oh, Miss Fine, you can't walk
a mile in your shoes. / Aha!

320
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:53,135
Humm, humm, humm, humm, humm, humm
a blouse ...

321
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:56,625
humm, humm, humm, humm, humm,
humm, humm, humm, humm.

322
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:01,851
Oh, Sally is very classy.

323
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:07,349
The way she handled those
bisexual Siamese twins ...

324
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:11,085
I'll tell you, Geraldo really
sensationalized it,

325
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:15,276
but Sally handled it with a plumb.

326
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:18,200
That's aplomb, Miss Fine.

327
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,220
No, it was a plumb.

328
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:25,187
What the devil does bisexual Siamese
twins have to do with the plumb?

329
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:27,863
It was pretty amazing.
