1
00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:06,828
Niles, and Brighton.
This is Maggie's.

2
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:11,482
Oh, who, ha, Mister Sheffield!

3
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:15,252
Guess again.

4
00:00:21,139 --> 00:00:25,869
Well that's way more than
I needed to know about him.

5
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:28,995
Oh, hi, kids. How are you
doing on your science project?

6
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,198
Ask Brooke. She's the genius.
I'm just the dumb blonde.

7
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:37,290
Oh... Me and Val used to do science
projects together. What's yours about?

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,568
Stress in the earth's igneous layers
and its effects on geological topography.

9
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:45,003
Oh. We grew potatoes on toothpicks.

10
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:48,767
Did you know that if you squeeze coal
really hard, it turns into a diamond?

11
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:50,049
Oh, not true.

12
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:55,986
One summer me and Val went through
a whole bag of Kingsford
Briquettes trying for earrings.

13
00:00:56,838 --> 00:01:02,618
No luck, huh? / No way. But to this day
I got a handshake like Lou Ferrigna.

14
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:08,074
Oh, Brighton, do you have a date
for the seventh grade dance?

15
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:11,305
Yeah, I got a couple of irons
in the fire, put out a few feelers.

16
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,643
Yeah. Neither do I.

17
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:21,331
I'll probably just go all by myself and
stand alone on the side with all the other wallflowers.

18
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,215
Oh good, so you're covered.

19
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,963
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,947 --> 00:01:30,165
Excuse me. I have to take
my allergy pills.

21
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:34,265
Oh, what are you allergic to, honey?
/ Everything but pollen.

22
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:39,905
Ow! Fran, I am not asking
her to the dance.

23
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:41,580
All right.

24
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,749
You're not gonna say anything?

25
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,772
It's not my place.

26
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,819
God will punish you.

27
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:52,847
Fran, look at her with those braids.
She looks like Alfalfa.

28
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,871
And with those allergies,
she's always so nasal.

29
00:01:55,871 --> 00:02:00,232
Hey, a lot of men find
that very alluring.

30
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:06,995
Yeah, right. If I don't ask her
to the dance, she might get upset

31
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:10,100
and there goes an automatic
`A' in science.

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,680
Well, as long as his heart's
in the right place.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,941
Oh, I remember my first dance.
I went with Richie Schneider.

34
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:19,730
He had two left feet.
/ Oh, a bit of a klutz, eh?

35
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:24,564
No, he had two left feet.

36
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:29,542
Some freak thing. His mother
was an X-ray technician.

37
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:35,007
I'm confused. Could he dance or not?

38
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,871
Actually, he was an excellent dancer.

39
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:42,574
Except when they did the hokey poky,
and they said put your left foot in...

40
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:49,753
The poor boy went down
like a ton of bricks.

41
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,885
So, Sheffield, who are
you gonna take to the dance?

42
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,235
I didn't have a pass, and that
hall monitor's a real little Nazi.

43
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,929
Whoa, Sheffield, way to go.

44
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:05,727
No. She's the nanny.
But you know, she wants me.

45
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,751
What?

46
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:12,846
Wants me to go to the orthodontist.
/ Hm-hmm. Come on.

47
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,323
Hi, Brighton.
/ Oh, no...

48
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:19,393
It's the Brooke worm.

49
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,670
I'm glad you're still here.

50
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,342
I fell in the A.D. room and had
to get a bandaid for my glasses.

51
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:27,873
Plus my inhaler clogged.

52
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:30,853
Honey, honey, men like
a little mystery.

53
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,565
Don't share.
/ Right...

54
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,415
Okay, Fran, let's go.
/ Brighton, wait.

55
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:39,142
My father wants to know
if he should drive us on Friday.

56
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:41,935
What are you talking about?

57
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:43,922
You asked me to the dance.

58
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:48,680
Look, I don't know what's in that inhaler,
but I wouldn't operate heavy machinery.

59
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:51,660
Brighton!
/ Oh, forget it.

60
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,576
Oh, Brooke...
Brighton, that was very mean!

61
00:04:55,576 --> 00:04:59,195
Now look what you've done.
You made her wheeze.

62
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:05,000
Brighton,
I am so disappointed in you.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,686
Fran, you've been yelling at me
since Sixtyeighth Street.
Are you gonna keep it up the whole way?

64
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:13,349
No. As soon as we pass Bergdorf's
I'm gonna start slapping you!

65
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:16,339
Fran, it was no big deal.

66
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:20,643
Don't you know what happens to young girls
when you torture them in high school?

67
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:25,083
Oh, we're going to the video store
and I'm renting you Carrie.

68
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,765
There's a very big likeness.
/ Yeah, yeah.

69
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:30,159
But, you know, it's too late
to do anything about it now.

70
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,598
No, it's never too late to right
a wrong that you've done to another human being.

71
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:41,181
Yeah. Unless, of course, that human being
has been shattered into a million miserable pieces!

72
00:05:41,486 --> 00:05:42,907
Oh, right.

73
00:05:43,536 --> 00:05:46,709
Uh, I work alone here.

74
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:50,913
Your behavior could scar
that little girl for the rest of her life.

75
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:54,599
And you should know. Hypocrite!

76
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,953
Let me guess, you don't survive
on tips, do you, Mister...

77
00:05:57,953 --> 00:06:03,685
Ahzee mah boo ala plea.

78
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:05,968
I share the cab.

79
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:09,722
Oh. Jeffrey Needleman.
Jeffrey Needleman?

80
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:11,203
Yeah, let me give you a hint, okay?

81
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:16,074
Picture me cramped in a locker with
a wedgie and a "kick me" sign on my forehead.

82
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:20,850
"Kick me" signs go on your back.
/ Yeah. They wanted me to see it coming.

83
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,886
This guy's the most
pathetic loser on earth.

84
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:28,187
Oh... Jeffrey Needleman.

85
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:32,002
Oh, Jeffrey, what have you been
doing since high school?

86
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:37,635
Shock therapy. / Oh, oh... Nice to see
things are picking up for you.

87
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:42,632
So, in other words, you guys went to
high school together and you tortured him.

88
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:46,693
I'm not the only one that
tortured him. The whole school did.

89
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:51,007
It was a requirement. It got you
out of talking a foreign language class.

90
00:06:51,007 --> 00:06:53,913
Oh, Fran, I am so disappointed in you.

91
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:57,645
All right, okay. That's enough.

92
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:02,026
You're right. It's not my place.
God will punish you.

93
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:06,793
You know, I remember you saying that
you'd go out with me that Sunday.

94
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:10,985
I said some day.

95
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:15,216
Some day. And that was only because
you were standing out on a ledge.

96
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:18,877
Is it some day yet?

97
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:23,177
Oh, I don't know, Jeffrey.
I'm so busy.

98
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,795
I, I really don't know
when I'll find the time.

99
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:28,955
Hey, you're free Saturday.
It's your day off.

100
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:33,898
Yes, that's true. But I might have to go
visit that poor little boy in the hospital

101
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:39,164
after that unfortunate high heel
to the butt accident!

102
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:45,252
Come on, Fran, you're gonna be late
for your date. The meter's running!

103
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:50,209
I don't feel a hundred percent.

104
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:56,092
Do I sound like I'm coming
down with a cold? / Constantly.

105
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:01,575
No, I mean it.
See if I have a temperature.

106
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:04,332
Oh, not the old thermometer
in the light bulb trick.

107
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:09,304
Brighton, please.
/ A hundred and twelve, Miss Fine.

108
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:14,152
Damn halogen lamps.

109
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:16,718
Fran, I'm very proud of you
for going through with this.

110
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,345
It's never too late
to right a wrong.

111
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:24,995
Why aren't you under a blanket with a flashlight
reading National Geographic like a normal kid?

112
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:28,118
Oh, Maxwell, please?
I'm begging you.

113
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:31,852
It'll only take a couple of minutes.
You don't even have to like it.

114
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:35,427
There's a speech she knows by heart.

115
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:45,884
C.C., you know my policy. I never read
plays written by friends, or relatives.

116
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:49,315
Or that Broadway bon vivant,
your psychiatrist.

117
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:51,322
But I told him you would read it.

118
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,284
And I don't want to risk offending him.
We're on the verge of a breakthrough.

119
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:58,487
Oh, good. Maybe he'll find
a personality we like.

120
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:03,090
Well, I'm terribly sorry, C.C., but I
simply don't do business favors for friends.

121
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,428
Well, I have to agree
with Mister Sheffield on that one.

122
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:09,937
I have an Uncle Aaron...
/ Oh...

123
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:15,646
he manufactured hernia trusses and
he gave one to his friend, Murray.

124
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:18,677
Well, P.S., he put it
on backwards, Murray,

125
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:21,635
and cut off his circulation.
Double amputation.

126
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:25,434
And I'm not talking
about his legs.

127
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:28,355
Miss Fine, isn't
this your day off?

128
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:33,647
Um, yeah, but I decided that I owe you
for that Jewish holiday that I made up.

129
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:36,818
You mean, there is no Matzo Day?

130
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,498
Uh-uh. / Well, we forgive you.
Just go on your date.

131
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:44,004
Oh, yes, by all means. Go have fun.
/ Uh, no, no, no, I have to...

132
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:46,854
Here, I have to take Gracie
to her ballet class.

133
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:48,803
Oh, no I'm taking her.
/ Oh.

134
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:54,096
Yeah, she's got a crush on my teacher,
big time. / Oh, that's nice.

135
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:56,737
Oh, he is so cute.
And talented.

136
00:09:56,737 --> 00:10:00,895
You should see his impersonation
of Liza Minnelli.

137
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,716
I'm gonna have to have
a talk with her.

138
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:17,507
Good afternoon.
I'm here to meet a man.

139
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:21,903
Might I suggest Happy Hour
at the Black Angus?

140
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,693
Oh, never mind.
That's him.

141
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,880
Oh, Franny, oh, look at you.
You look scrump-de-a-licious.

142
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,351
Oh... He's a war hero.

143
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,706
Here you are, my good man.
Your best table.

144
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:42,966
Save it. You may want
to do laundry later.

145
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:57,773
What? Oh, no, no.
I brought one for you, too.

146
00:10:57,773 --> 00:10:59,472
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

147
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:05,445
That's very sweet, but I don't think
I'd be comfortable sitting on wooden balls...

148
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,658
at least not on the first date.

149
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:16,326
I'm telling you. You drive a cab,
everybody thinks you're invisible.

150
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:19,080
You know how many men pick their nose? Huh?
/ Oh, I don't know. No, I have no idea.

151
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,252
Huh? No, take a guess.
Go ahead, give it a shot. Give it a shot.

152
00:11:21,252 --> 00:11:24,584
One out of five.

153
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,840
Jeffrey, you're such a raconteur.

154
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,535
Oh, I got a million stories.
/ You shouldn't waste them all on me.

155
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:34,917
You should write some of this stuff down.
/ Actually, I have.

156
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,533
Oh / I wrote a play.

157
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,963
Oh, isn't that a coincidence?

158
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:43,860
I happen to work for
a Broadway... bus driver.

159
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,482
A bus driver who can afford
a nanny? / Oh, unions.

160
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,504
Oh, oh, I almost forgot. Here.

161
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,866
Oh... / I brought this for you.

162
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:58,040
Jeffrey, you didn't have to get
me a... blue frost eye shadow kit?

163
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,272
That's your blue frost
eye shadow kit.

164
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:03,477
You remember? Mrs. Barnett
confiscated it from you in homeroom.

165
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:06,077
I swiped it from her desk.

166
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:10,233
And you saved it all these years.

167
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:14,115
Oh... Isn't that sweet, Jeffrey.

168
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:17,356
And yet oddly disturbing.

169
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:20,998
You know what would make me
the happiest man on earth?

170
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:22,394
What?

171
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:24,529
Look, I, I know you didn't wanna
do it with me in high school,

172
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:28,876
but I, I, I was hoping that
you had changed your mind.

173
00:12:28,876 --> 00:12:31,854
I, I doubt it.

174
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:35,077
Oh, what the hell? Why don't
we do it right here on the floor?

175
00:12:35,077 --> 00:12:38,312
Oh, check, please!
/ Come on, Fran. Do the Hustle.

176
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:40,513
What?
/ Come on, please. Dance with me.

177
00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:45,785
Oh, Jeffrey, I don't think
I remember the Hustle anymore...

178
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:36,660
Oh, Jeffrey, I think
I pulled a Hustle muscle.

179
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:42,041
That was fantastic. / Thank you.
I, I have a great partner over at Arthur Murray.

180
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,702
She's eightytwo, but boy,
can she turn the beat around.

181
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:49,865
You know, Jeffrey, this isn't
such a bad date afterall.

182
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:52,090
Good. Marry me.

183
00:13:57,661 --> 00:14:00,643
You're kidding, aren't you?
/ Please.

184
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:05,247
Oh, Jeffrey, it's incredibly
flattering and

185
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:08,564
well I hope you don't take
this the wrong way...

186
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:12,602
Jeffrey, Jeffrey, don't jump!
Did he pay the check?

187
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:21,505
Jeffrey, don't jump.
You have too much to live for.

188
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:23,976
Yeah? Yeah? Name one thing.

189
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:26,184
Give me a minute.

190
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:28,673
Goodbye.
/ No, Jeffrey, wait! Ahh...

191
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:34,033
He jumped?
/ No. I leaned on pigeon poop.

192
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:37,711
I mean it.
I'm gonna jump.

193
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,983
Jeffrey, please, I'll do whatever you say.
/ Sleep with me.

194
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:44,369
What's your second choice?
/ Another date.

195
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:47,021
And what else you got?
/ Okay, fine, that's it.

196
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,424
No, Jeffrey, wait, wait.

197
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:51,467
Maybe you should take off your heels.

198
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:55,469
Are you crazy? That would screw up
my balance completely...

199
00:14:56,472 --> 00:15:01,233
Oh, oh my God. Jeffrey,
look how high up we are.

200
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,818
Oh, Jeffrey, I'm a scared.
Hold my hand. Hold my hand.

201
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:09,333
I'm gonna jump. / Let go of my hand!
Let go of my hand!

202
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:14,572
Oh, Jeffrey, look at all those people
down there staring up at us.

203
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:17,147
You wearing underwear?

204
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:20,593
Of course I am...

205
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:25,688
Jeffrey, please, let's go inside.

206
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:29,415
No. No, if I can't have you,
I have no	reason to live.

207
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:31,807
Sure you do. You got friends.
/ None.

208
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,084
Family. / Estranged.

209
00:15:33,084 --> 00:15:35,748
A dog.
/ Bit me.

210
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:37,635
I know. Your writing.

211
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,634
Oh, yeah. That, that's a dead end.
Nobody's gonna read my play.

212
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,286
In this town, you have	to know somebody.

213
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:48,484
I know somebody. I work for Maxwell
Sheffield, the big Broadway producer.

214
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:50,889
I thought you worked for a bus driver?

215
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,093
Bus driver and Broadway producer.

216
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:56,921
Well, he wasn't gonna
give up that pension.

217
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:03,548
I don't mean to be negative here,
but I don't think this spud
is gonna get us an `A'.

218
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:06,351
I don't need an `A'. I always get an `A'.

219
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:09,735
I wanna see what a `D' feels like.

220
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:14,485
Oh, you're mad about the dance.
/ And they say I'm the genius.

221
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:17,714
Brooke, we've been friends for
a long time now. Why do things have to change?

222
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:21,213
I'm a woman now. I have needs.

223
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,452
Yeah, well I have needs, too.
I need an `A' in Science.

224
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:28,761
Oh, hello, Brooke.
/ Men!

225
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,895
Women!
/ What was that all about?

226
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:35,260
Why do girls have to take
everything so	personally?

227
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,443
Oh well, women are just different from us,
son. They're, they're more emotional.

228
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:44,110
I mean, when I get a bad review,
I don't run crying to Niles and say `I need a hug.'

229
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,723
Well, there was that one time
in New Haven.

230
00:16:48,485 --> 00:16:51,418
That review was scathing.

231
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:54,964
Thanks, guys. Big help.

232
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:59,301
Oh, Fran, I feel really
guilty about Brooke.

233
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,973
Oh, honey, take her,
don't take her.

234
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:03,900
Do whatever you wanna do.

235
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,733
Okay. I'll just
grow up by myself.

236
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,424
Wait, Fran.

237
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:10,864
You like my make-up?
/ Uh-huh.

238
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,877
Gracie's ballet teacher did it for me.
/ Oh...

239
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:20,073
Ballet teacher and make-up artist.

240
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,665
Honey, we're definitely gonna have
to have a talk. Just not now, okay?

241
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,910
I'm in a terrible hurry.

242
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,404
And it was a not a hug,
it was a pat on the back.

243
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:33,577
I just had a particularly horrid review
and was looking for a little understanding.

244
00:17:33,577 --> 00:17:38,540
You wept openly, sir, and it was
very uncomfortable for me.

245
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,839
It was nineteen-seventytwo. We were
all getting in touch with our feelings.

246
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:47,104
Mister Sheffield, Mister Sheffield,
we got a crisis on our hands.

247
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,724
Don't crumble, sir.

248
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,357
Aren't you supposed to be on a date?
/ Well, technically, I still am.

249
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:57,010
Oh. How's it going? / Oh, I've
had better. I've had worse.

250
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,382
It's kind of up in the air.

251
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,485
Why didn't you take
my emergency call?

252
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:08,886
Because the last time you had the operator
break through it was to tape The Bold And Beautiful.

253
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:11,456
Well, Storm was about
to marry Stephanie.

254
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:15,534
So what's the problem?
/ She's his mother.

255
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:20,789
Miss Fine, I believe you mentioned
something about a crisis.

256
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:24,103
Oh, yeah, my date is about
to kill himself!

257
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,153
Oh, you didn't tell him
the hernia story, did you?

258
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:30,290
Or Aunt Frieda's
lyposuction mishap?

259
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,117
Uncle Jack's dependence on vino?

260
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:36,964
No. I'm serious.

261
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:40,471
You have to read his play.
It's a matter of life and death.

262
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:45,089
Maxwell, if she gets to show you
her's, I get to show you mine.

263
00:18:45,414 --> 00:18:49,856
Oh, that ain't worth it.
Let him jump. / Let who jump?

264
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:54,714
My date. He is standing out on a ledge.
He is about to kill himself.

265
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,710
My God, this is terrible.

266
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,283
I'll say. Well, not a total loss.
The Clams Casino are to die for.

267
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:02,761
Could you please just...
/ Not now, Brighton.

268
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:04,506
But I really...
/ Later, Brighton.

269
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:07,992
But it's really important!
I need to talk to someone now!

270
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:13,327
Aunt C.C.'s still here.
/ It can wait.

271
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:23,275
Then she says I'm sorry...

272
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,879
Wait. I'm not through yet.

273
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:33,890
Miss Fine, there
is some urgency here.

274
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:36,399
get in, in the... Okay.

275
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:40,228
Come on, is he through yet?
I'm freezing out here.

276
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:43,647
Well, you know what you could do.
You could come in!

277
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:46,520
You're right. Oh, oh no, nice try.

278
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,472
Here. I'm through with the soup.

279
00:19:48,472 --> 00:19:51,206
You want a sweet? / Uh, no, no.
I gotta watch my weight.

280
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:55,281
What's the matter? You're afraid
you're gonna make a bigger hole?

281
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:58,104
All right, what d' you got?

282
00:19:58,104 --> 00:20:01,812
Uh... Oh, they got a tarter
tan, a linzer tart.

283
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:06,203
Oh, this looks good. / You know,
they got, got any chocolate cake?

284
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:08,604
No.

285
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,396
I don't hear laughing.

286
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:16,472
You're kidding? Kidding? Which part?
Which part? / The funny part.

287
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,866
He hates it. / Oh, what are
you listening to him for?

288
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:24,070
He passed on Cats.

289
00:20:24,438 --> 00:20:27,959
It was singing pussycat people,

290
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:31,722
in a giant garbage can. I mean,
what would you have done?

291
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:36,273
Two words, Mister Sheffield:
Still running.

292
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:41,931
But what, Jeffrey, what do you always
care what everybody else thinks?

293
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:44,999
Why? You don't think I should?

294
00:20:47,508 --> 00:20:49,246
It's a brilliant play.

295
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:51,636
Oh, come on, Mister Sheffield.
You don't have to lay it on so thick.

296
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:55,324
No. No, no, no. I, I mean.
I'm going to auction it.

297
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:58,287
Did you hear that, Jeffrey?
He's gonna buy your play!

298
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:02,363
All right...!
/ No...!

299
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,836
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

300
00:21:10,097 --> 00:21:13,095
God, he landed right in that
huge mountain of garbage.

301
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:17,505
Oh boy, is he lucky we live in New York.

302
00:21:19,183 --> 00:21:24,913
Oh, B, you look so handsome.
Smile.

303
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:29,289
Oh, you and Brooke are gonna be
the cutest couple at the dance.

304
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,357
Yeah, but the guys are gonna shred me.

305
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:34,967
Oh, honey, you just remember
that you're more mature than they are.

306
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:37,687
You just walk in there
and hold your head up high.

307
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:39,985
Look `em square
in the eye and say,

308
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:43,232
"So's your mother."

309
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:47,770
So, Brighton, your first
date alone with a girl.

310
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,108
Is there anything
we need to talk about?

311
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,336
Dad, please,
I'm going out with Brooke.

312
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:53,905
So you don't have
any questions?

313
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:56,873
Yeah. Why am I going out with Brooke?

314
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:59,982
How do I look? / Great.
/ There you go. / Thank you.

315
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,845
Wow.

316
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:12,420
Hi, Brighton.
/ Wow.

317
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:16,174
Are you ready to go, Brighton?
/ Just one second.

318
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:18,952
Dad, can we have that talk?

319
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:21,261
Go on, son. You'll be just fine.

320
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:25,307
See? You did the right thing
and God smiled on you.

321
00:22:25,674 --> 00:22:30,198
God, Maybelline,
and half-a-box of Kleenex.

00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:33,075
Thanks, Fran.

323
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:36,543
Fran, how do I look?
/ Ravishing as always.

324
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:39,371
Good. `Cause I'm going to pick up
Gracie from ballet class.

325
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:41,876
Oh, her teacher is so gorgeous.

326
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:45,855
I don't know who's cuter.
Him or his roommate, Chuck.

327
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:52,851
Chuck, huh? Honey, it's time
we had that little talk...

328
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,896
Huh?

329
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,398
Get ready...
