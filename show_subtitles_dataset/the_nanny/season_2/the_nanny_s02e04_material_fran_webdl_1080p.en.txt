1
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:05,027
Ah, I'll tell you,
these personals are such a joke.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:11,830
Downloaded From www.AllSubs.org

3
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:06,968
Look at this,
"single white female."

4
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:10,517
That could mean anyone
from Madonna to Janet Reno.

5
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:15,572
Oh, here's one,
"exotic good looks."

6
00:00:15,572 --> 00:00:18,837
I'm seeing a debilitory problem.

7
00:00:19,523 --> 00:00:24,296
I ask you, what kind of a loser shells
out 200 bucks for one of these?

8
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:27,263
How do you know
how much it costs?

9
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:30,568
Niles, clean up that mess.
/ What mess?

10
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:32,820
That one.

11
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:40,598
Sweetie, don't forget your RSVP
for Jody's slumber party.

12
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:42,019
I don't want to go.

13
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:44,977
Why not? Sweetie, you get
to eat like a pig,

14
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:47,288
make funny phone calls,
and throw your guts up.

15
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:50,582
It's a very special time
in a little girl's life.

16
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:54,596
Sure it sounds like fun, but I don't
know if I can sleep without my bear.

17
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,800
So take Teddy with you?

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,918
Everybody will make fun of me.
You have no idea how cruel children can be.

19
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:06,638
Honey, I've had this voice since
the second grade. Need I say more?

20
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,785
I just don't know if I can sleep alone.

21
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:13,179
Oh, don't worry. You get used to it.

22
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:05,117
Oh, look. Here's a gem.

23
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:08,574
"Young bi-couple dig snakes,

24
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:13,072
contact Naomi, P.O. Box 666,

25
00:02:13,072 --> 00:02:15,978
no weirdos."

26
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:21,662
Niles, move it with the food.

27
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:25,406
These society women are vultures.
Where's the pate?

28
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:29,517
Why don't you just lie on the floor
and let them peck at your liver?

29
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:35,214
This luncheon is very important.

30
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:39,073
These women are deciding between contributing
to our show and the children's milk fund.

31
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:43,164
I don't want any thirsty little
brats beating me out of that money.

32
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,990
Fran, I need a favor. Billy Hartwell
wants to take me to a concert.

33
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,331
Oh, great. What concert?
/ You wouldn't know them.

34
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:55,639
Maggie, how old do you think I am?
/ The Stone Temple Pilots.

35
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,045
I'm 100.

36
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,775
So why? You want me to ask
your father if you can go?

37
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:04,388
And ... The concert's
kind of sold out.

38
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:07,472
So could you ask him
if he could get us tickets too?

39
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:11,318
Oh, sure, Mags, you want
backstage passes, fake I.D.'s,

40
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:14,516
the whole fat-chance package?

41
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:16,967
Thanks, Fran.

42
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:21,899
I don't know what they expect from me.
These are hands, not wands.

43
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:26,131
Although they have performed
magic in their day.

44
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:31,479
Niles, you know what those women pay
to get that stuff sucked out of them?

45
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:35,824
I beg your pardon ... Miss Babcock
specifically requested fat-free cream puffs.

46
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:39,029
Oh, come on, this is loaded
with butter, eggs, and heavy cream.

47
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:41,415
There's enough cholesterol
in there to kill them.

48
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:43,484
Oh, really?

49
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:51,509
Ladies, it is my very great pleasure
to introduce my very dear,

50
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:56,982
very close personal friend,
Maxwell Sheffield.

51
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:59,089
Who are these boring,
dreadful women again?

52
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:03,419
They're wives of very rich men.
/ Ladies.

53
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,268
Brighten,

54
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:09,453
Brighten give her back that
damn bear, you little...

55
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:14,421
Oh, hello. Excuse me. Pardon me.

56
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,753
Fake Chanel.

57
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:25,338
Kathy Marie O'Mally?
Oh, my God.

58
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:29,939
I'm terribly sorry. Do I know you?
/ Kathy, it's me, Fran Fine, from Flushing Heights.

59
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:35,565
Wow! They did a great job on your teeth.
Look, your chin comes forward and everything.

60
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:39,697
I don't know... / Oh, and you
finally got yourself a pair of...

61
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:47,039
This is Kathrine Porter
of the Park Avenue Porters.

62
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,678
Now if I let you breathe again,
will you go away?

63
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:53,931
Promise?

64
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:59,474
I hope those are saline because...

65
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,179
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop.

66
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:10,182
Why do you have to act so crude
for at at such a fancy party?

67
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:13,216
Well, I'm just kidding around.
/ Yeah, well, have a little class.

68
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:18,673
Now go help Niles clear. And remember I got
dibs on all the leftovers with no cigarette butts.

69
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,012
You know, Brighten's right.
I can't live without I my bear.

70
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:29,549
Let's face it, I'm codependent,
and Teddy's my enabler.

71
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:32,274
Sweetie, I know it's tough.

72
00:05:32,274 --> 00:05:35,555
I've had to ween myself off
of lots of stuff.

73
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:40,442
Caffeine, cigarettes, my ex-boyfriend,
Danny, and that was really tough.

74
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:44,524
Every time somebody burped garlic,
I got a craving.

75
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,606
Oh, Fran, I'll try.

76
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:50,829
Oh, good girl.

77
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:53,454
But I'm going to miss
his furry little body.

78
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,883
That's the same way
I felt about Danny.

79
00:05:57,556 --> 00:06:01,142
Hi. Are the leftovers ready yet?
/ Yeah, help yourself.

80
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:04,256
Take that one.
Just eat around the lipstick.

81
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:09,680
Oh, you are never going to guess
who is at the party out there.

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,765
Kathy Marie O'Mally.
/ Get out of here. Are you sure?

83
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,625
Yeah.
/ Does she still have the shag?

84
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,554
No. And she's nowhere without it.
/ Has she aged?

85
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:20,438
Like a bowl of fruit.

86
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:25,915
Has she had any work done?
/ More than L.A. after the quake.

87
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,628
Meow Mix, ladies?

88
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,865
Excuse me. Could somebody please
point me to the powder room?

89
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:38,152
Ah, yeah. Sure.

90
00:06:38,152 --> 00:06:42,428
Cause I busted out of gym class,
and I'm dying for a smoke.

91
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:43,474
Hey ...

92
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,891
Kathy,
/ I knew it was you.

93
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:51,298
I was just telling Val how
gorgeous you look.

94
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:54,677
So what's with the act?

95
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:56,762
Ah, what about
Mr. French over there?

96
00:06:56,762 --> 00:07:00,013
Oh, Niles, you can trust him.
He's like Shultz.

97
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:04,134
I know nothing, nothing.

98
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:08,165
So what are you doing here?
/ Oh, I married up.

99
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:11,406
Wow!
/ What are you doing here?

100
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:14,128
I'm the nanny.
/ Oh ...

101
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:16,753
What?
/ Oh, nothing.

102
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:20,709
You know, I mean, it's just everybody
thought you were really going places.

103
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,785
Oh, well, I showed them.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,663
You remember Val?

105
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:29,750
I'm blank.
/ Oh, sure you do.

106
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,520
Remember when we all used to go
to Rye Beach Playland?

107
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,277
Val would get up early and stand
in a parking spot until we'd get this.

108
00:07:37,277 --> 00:07:39,732
Those were the days.
/ Oh, yeah.

109
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:43,008
So how'd you meet Mr. Right?
/ I sued him.

110
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,453
Wow! How romantic.

111
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:49,814
He rear ended me.
/ I'm not into that.

112
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:56,383
Now I remember you.

113
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,116
You know, my husband has a partner.
Oh, Franny, you should meet him. He's loaded.

114
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,842
Oh, no. I couldn't date anyone
just cause he was rich.

115
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:08,613
What are you prejudice?

116
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,975
You going to hold it against him
because he's got two Ferraris?

117
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:16,191
Oh, well, it's not really his fault.

118
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,979
A house in Monte Carlo?

119
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:24,214
When did I get so intolerant?
/ A private jet and a diamond mind.

120
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:28,197
Oh, you're right. I'm a bigot.
I should be ashamed of myself.

121
00:08:28,197 --> 00:08:30,629
I'm going to have
to work through it.

122
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,990
I can't believe
I'm going on this date.

123
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,512
I mean the man is a millionaire.

124
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:44,134
I'm just a simple girl
with simple tastes.

125
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:50,956
Where's my other earring?
/ I'm changing the bulb.

126
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:59,022
Fran, can you ask dad about the concert
before you leave? I'll die
if I don't find out tonight.

127
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:03,396
Oh, well, we wouldn't want that to happen.
I get paid less with only two kids ...

128
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:08,167
Oh, Mr. Sheffield ...
/ No ...

129
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:10,705
Oh, all right. Forget it.
/ Fran ...

130
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:14,534
Oh, no Maggie. Give it up. I mean
he can't get you that those tickets.

131
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,309
He doesn't have
those kind of connections.

132
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:21,246
I beg your pardon. I can get tickets
to any show on Broadway.

133
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:23,892
Oh, Broadway. Sure, of course.

134
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:26,618
I mean, you know, if she wants
to go see Ann Miller in "Sugar Babies",

135
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:32,191
you'll be the first one we call.
But this is the rock world, you know.

136
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:35,058
I mean it's way out of your sphere.

137
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:38,905
I'll have you know I was staging
happenings on Carnaby Street

138
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:44,073
while you were still scouring the semiannual clearance sale at Toys R Us.

139
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:47,897
Does the word "Donovan" mean
anything you to?

140
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,368
Oh, I loved him.

141
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:54,056
"They call me mellow yellow" ...

142
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:56,952
Quite rightly.

143
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:06,708
Meanwhile, explain to me
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."

144
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:10,240
The girl with colitis goes by?

145
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,566
I always thought that was
very distasteful.

146
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:24,517
That's the girl with kaleidoscope
eyes, Miss Fine.

147
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:26,285
Oh ...

148
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,953
Leave it to Flushing to turn a beautiful
image into a bowel dysfunction.

149
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:39,334
Well, don't you worry, Maggie.
I will get you those tickets.

150
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:42,755
Electrical banana ...

151
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:47,197
Let's hope that's not hereditary.

152
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:50,019
Thank you, so much, Fran.
That was awesome.

153
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,802
Oh, well, I might be old, but
the noodle is still sharp as a tack.

154
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,655
Oh, my God, Nanny Fine. Don't tell
me you're wearing that cheap tacky dress

155
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:03,954
to meet Richard Porter's oldest friend.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that dress.

156
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,475
You'd have to be dead
six months to fit into it.

157
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:14,983
Wow, this could be
the man of my dreams.

158
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:18,600
He could be handsome.
He could be sexy ...

159
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,737
or he could be my grandfather.

160
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:30,673
How do you do?
I'm Theodore Timmons.

161
00:11:30,673 --> 00:11:34,735
When you said he was Richard Porter's
oldest friend, you weren't kidding.

162
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:38,748
Theo, I'm Fran.

163
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:43,269
I hope you're not disappointed?
I know I'm not.

164
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:45,982
Oh ... please, come in.
Sit down.

165
00:11:45,982 --> 00:11:48,662
I couldn't decide between
flowers and candy.

166
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:53,681
Oh, well, isn't that the old age
question... age old, age old.

167
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:02,375
You're a, a beautiful young woman.

168
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:06,158
Be still my heart.
Not too still.

169
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:11,311
Oh ... Theo, stop.
Woops! Don't fall.

170
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:20,225
My God, what on earth are
all these flowers for?

171
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:23,078
Either Miss Fine's date with
Mr. Timmons went extremely well

172
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:26,528
or he died and we're
hosting the wake.

173
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,567
Oh, poor thing. And she was so
looking forward to this date.

174
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:35,689
I just hope he isn't using her
to get to her bone marrow.

175
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,774
All right. Decorum.

176
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:44,461
She's probably humiliated enough without
walking in and finding us laughing at her.

177
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:47,274
Yeah, you're right. Poor thing.

178
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:50,605
Good morning, everyone.

179
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:56,544
Oh, would you look at all these
flowers for a handshake.

180
00:12:56,544 --> 00:13:00,608
What do you get for
a goodnight kiss? Holland?

181
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:05,319
What?

182
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,103
Bam-pa-pa-bam ...

183
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:14,415
Miss Fine, aren't you a little
overdressed for breakfast?

184
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:19,774
Oh, well, obviously you've never been
to morning services at Temple Emanuel.

185
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:25,540
I, I take it the date of
a crowning success.

186
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:29,069
Thank you, Sheckie Sheffield.

187
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:33,684
Actually, it went a lot better
than I expected it to.

188
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:36,956
For starters, he lived through it.

189
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:42,345
All right. So he's a little
more mature than I'm used to.

190
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:46,343
Mature? Fran, we're talking
"Encino Man."

191
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,536
Does he at least have a good body?
/ Oh, honey, you know Fabio?

192
00:13:52,536 --> 00:13:56,088
Put his feet on Burgess Meredith.

193
00:13:59,444 --> 00:14:02,705
Well, I'm glad to see you're not
taking this too seriously.

194
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:06,531
Who said I wasn't? He happens
to be very sweet, very witty,

195
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:10,284
and just full of cash...
I mean life.

196
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:14,339
I don't know,
he just makes me feel young.

197
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,849
Miss Fine, he would make Stonehenge feel young.

198
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:21,802
Ah, you know, Maggie, Theo owns
a couple of recording labels.

199
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:24,510
Maybe he could get you those
tickets to the concert?

200
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,880
I said I'd get those tickets,
and get them I shall.

201
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,567
Oh, well, maybe he could get
you backstage passes?

202
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,982
Back stage?
I'll get her on the stage.

203
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:38,217
They'll even break a bloody
guitar over her blasted head.

204
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:40,285
Cool.

205
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:44,260
Miss Fine, Mr. Timmons to see you.
/ Oh ...

206
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:47,099
Sheffield, I'm sorry to
interrupt your breakfast,

207
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:51,106
but I, I just had to see
my baby doll.

208
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:56,510
Oh... Well, I guess
I'm the only baby doll here.

209
00:14:56,953 --> 00:14:59,054
Oh... Theo.

210
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:03,858
I had the sweetest dreams last night,
and they were all about you.

211
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:08,090
Oh, Theo. Stop. Whoa!

212
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:15,571
You were covered in diamonds, kiddo.

213
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,678
Oh, Theo, you are so extravagant,

214
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:23,244
but really, let's get to know
each other first. Honestly,

215
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:28,517
a good conversation to me is worth
more than all the jewels in the world.

216
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:32,393
Do you want to have dinner in Paris?
/ Enough said.

217
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:48,828
Talk about elegance, this is the first time
I've ever been in a toilet on a plane

218
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:52,467
where I didn't feel like I was going
to be sucked out over the Atlantic ...

219
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:53,227
Thank you ...

220
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:58,849
Say, are they even going
to say two words to us?

221
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:01,559
I mean how am I going to get to
know Theo better...

222
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,145
Franny, leave them alone.

223
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:06,645
Every minute they don't talk to us,
they make another million.

224
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:13,846
Well, money is nice, but there are more
important things than... is that lobster?

225
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:19,087
Hey, babe
/ Not now, I'm eating

226
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:29,065
Aren't you going to eat too?
/ No, I'm going to nap.

227
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:33,160
How could you nap with 19.95
a pound staring you in the face?

228
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,850
Franny, stick with me, and you will
be sleeping through caviar.

229
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:44,390
I hate waste.

230
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:57,829
How's the champagne?
/ Oh, it's nice and dry.

231
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:19,121
You know, at Sizzler they take
it out of the shell ...

232
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:32,731
Oh, Theo, you know, I've never been
to Paris, but I've always wanted to go,

233
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:35,746
ever since the "Facts of Life"
girls went there.

234
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:39,118
Babe, you and Kathy do the town.
Buy whatever you want.

235
00:17:39,118 --> 00:17:45,482
What? I'm not going to see you all day?
/ Oh, look at that little lip, like a baby.

236
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:49,052
Theo, I'm serious.
I don't want to go all alone.

237
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,644
Whatever you say, baby.

238
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:58,280
Kathy, baby, come
sit in daddy's lap.

239
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,006
What's he going to do?
Burp you? / If he wants.

240
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:17,960
I thought the Eiffel Tower leans.

241
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:21,231
No, Val.

242
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:24,020
That's Big Ben.
/ Oh.

243
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,091
What's eating you?

244
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,161
Oh, I'm breaking up with Theo.
/ Why?

245
00:18:30,161 --> 00:18:35,941
Because he takes me to Paris,
and all I did was fly in a private jet,

246
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:40,621
shop at the finest stores, eat
in a five-star restaurant, and go home.

247
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,983
Drop dead.

248
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:48,254
Val, he doesn't care about what
I have to say.

249
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:52,357
I'm nothing but window dressing
to him, a beautiful ornament.

250
00:18:52,357 --> 00:18:54,901
Vanna White.

251
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:57,793
You love Vanna.

252
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:00,776
I know. But I don't want to be her.

253
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:05,408
I want to buy the vowels.
I want to solve the puzzle.

254
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:11,080
Oh, Fran, you should write that down.

255
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:15,961
I want a relationship,
a real relationship.

256
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:18,372
Like Luke and Laura.

257
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:23,142
Fran, listen to what you're saying.
It's ridiculous.

258
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:26,656
Luke would never leave her again.

259
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,154
Val, you're going to have
to move away from those power lines.

260
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:37,161
All I'm saying is that I need
a guy that cares about what I think.

261
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:40,081
Miss Fine, what do you think?

262
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:44,245
I've got these concert tickets for Maggie,
but now I'm having second thoughts
about letting her go.

263
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:47,926
You know, we're really in
the middle of something here.

264
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:52,269
Why don't you get another pair.
We'll sit a couple of rows back;
we'll keep an eye on her.

265
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:56,530
Oh, excellent idea, Miss Fine.
What would I do without you?

266
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:01,685
All I'm saying is
I need a guy who needs me.

267
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,015
The driver is here. Are these all
the things you want sent back to Mr. Timmons?

268
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,219
Yes.

269
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,938
Let me see your hands.
/ No.

270
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:12,727
Must I get the poultry shears?

271
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,578
Oh, all right, but Niles ...

272
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:19,185
diamonds are a girl's best friend,
and now I'm all alone.

273
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:24,578
Oh, you've still got plenty of friends.
Mr. Rhinestone and Mr. Zircon come to mind.

274
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:38,029
God, I can hardly hear myself think.

275
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,919
Drink?
No, I don't want a drink.

276
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,327
Wasn't that opening act awful?
What a joke.

277
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,224
Coke? Yeah, sure,
I'm in the mood.

278
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:49,850
I'll have some food.
Let's get a hot dog.

279
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:53,243
Hot dog and a coke, please.

280
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:58,647
"I Want To Hold Your Hand,"
that was music. / Wasn't it?

281
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:01,464
"She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah."

282
00:21:01,464 --> 00:21:03,603
Now those were lyrics.
/ Brilliant.

283
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:06,809
Who can relate to a song
"Dead and Bloated"?

284
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,872
Unless you've been to
my mother's for Thanksgiving.

285
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:12,761
There you go, Miss Fine.
/ Oh, thanks. Um, yummy.

286
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:15,506
I don't know.
I feel a thousand years old.

287
00:21:15,506 --> 00:21:18,268
Try hiking up your underwear,
pulling down your pants a little,

288
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:20,430
then you'll fit right in.

289
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,915
Ha. You first.
/ Ha, ha, ha.

290
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:27,803
Well, I'll tell you, you want
to feel young, hang out with Theo.

291
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:29,819
Oh, I don't know, Miss Fine.

292
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:34,329
I think if you had played your cards right,
it wouldn't have been long before
you were a very wealthy woman.

293
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:39,302
Meanwhile, there are plenty of bimbos
that grew old and died waiting for George Burns.

294
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:44,653
I need someone
I can share things with.

295
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,612
Thanks, I'm so parched.

296
00:21:46,612 --> 00:21:48,316
You know, you're
absolutely right.

297
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:51,843
A good relationship has to
be about give and take.

298
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,701
Hum?
/ Oh, thank you. Yeah.

299
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:56,962
Besides, you have to have stuff
you can have in common.

300
00:21:56,962 --> 00:22:02,384
Uh-huh. Catsup and mustard,
just the way I like it. / Oh, sure.

301
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,171
I hope I didn't break his little heart.
/ Um ...

302
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:10,273
Although he does have a couple of
new valves in there.

303
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:14,755
Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Miss Fine.
He seems to have made a full recovery.

304
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:18,292
He's probably with
some really young chippie.

305
00:22:22,736 --> 00:22:24,902
Cee Cee?

306
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,744
It seems she's inherited
your earrings, Miss Fine.

307
00:22:28,744 --> 00:22:30,711
Well, I've got news for her.

308
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:34,420
They're nothing without the necklace.

309
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,300
Ow! Ow!

310
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:48,993
That's right, sweetie.

311
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:53,001
Keep snapping that rubber band
every time you think of the bear.

312
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:56,119
It's called "negative reinforcement,"
and it really works.

313
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,955
Yeah, but now my watch
doesn't fit anymore.

314
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,084
Hey, tell me about it.
When I quit smoking,

315
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:07,012
I had a wrist that was the size of
my Aunt Frida's ankle after
she had salty fish.

316
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,379
Are you ready? / Yeah.

317
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:14,983
Congratulations. Today is
the first day of the rest of your life.

318
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:18,018
Hi, Gracie.

319
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:25,571
Ah, we'll be right back.
