1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,224
Hello, my name is Maggie Sheffield,
and I'm a total geek.

2
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:12,223
You are so immature.
/ Yeah, Brighten, you're so immature.

3
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:13,742
Ha, ha, ha.

4
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:17,570
Miss Fine, you're mother's 50?

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,045
Isn't she stretching
the truth just a tad?

6
00:00:20,045 --> 00:00:24,817
Please, the only thing stretched
more is Clinton's bicycle shorts.

7
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:30,148
Fifty billion served and
that's the white house.

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,241
Gee, I wonder
if my daughter Fran is at home.

9
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:39,071
I will see if she is.

10
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:40,677
Come on, kids, get ready.

11
00:00:40,677 --> 00:00:44,857
Fran, how come we're practicing
the surprise party? Then it
won't be a surprise.

12
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:47,338
Oh, sweetie, at your age
a surprise is a big thrill.

13
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:52,575
At her age, they're already rubbing
two paddles together and yelling clear.

14
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:59,150
Surprise!
/ Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:06,944
Ma, I hope you fake
it better with daddy.

16
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:13,985
I was his first.
What does he know?

17
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,835
Excuse me, Miss Sylvia,
I just want to double-check the menu.

18
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,813
Meat balls, cocktail franks,
cheese puffs —

19
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:24,126
is there some reason you don't
want your family to handle silverware?

20
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,187
Darling, don't you know?

21
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:29,767
If it's on a toothpick,
it's not fattening. / Oh ...

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,934
Yeah, my Aunt Frita
uses two like chopsticks.

23
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:37,954
She looks like a very heavily
made-up praying mantis.

24
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:43,587
Are there going to be any boys
my age at this party?

25
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:47,321
Maybe we can fix her up
with little Cousin Irvie.

26
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:51,563
Oh, he's a nice boy with
a wonderful personality.

27
00:01:51,563 --> 00:01:57,268
Oh, Yeah, good idea, Ma. Is he still
ringing the bill at Notre Dame?

28
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,796
Don't worry, don't worry. When I see
him coming, I'll give you a very subtle sign.

29
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:08,556
Ah, there's the birthday girl.

30
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:13,009
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you're such
a doll letting us have my party here.

31
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:17,297
You know, we only have
one toilet and, um,

32
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:22,511
Morty's brothers are all coming.

33
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:27,815
Oh, oh, that reminds me. Sweetie,
go put an Airwick Solid in every bathroom.

34
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:32,795
So, Miss Babcock, are you coming
to my surprise party?

35
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:37,514
I'm afraid not.
/ And it's just killing us.

36
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:40,181
We're taking the train to Gene
Shallots for the weekend.

37
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:43,030
Gene Shallot ... Hoo-ha.

38
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,105
Is he sexy or what?

39
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:48,830
Ma, Gene Shallot sexy?

40
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,049
Oh, you gotta stop inhaling
when you spray your hair.

41
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:56,430
They're having a little gathering
before the Tony nominations.

42
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:06,831
Oh, Miss Fine, here.

43
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:11,506
Allow me to contribute this exquisite
Chanbertin to your mother's party.

44
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:14,665
Maxwell, I thought this wine was
for our weekend.

45
00:03:14,665 --> 00:03:18,065
I don't think the Fines would
appreciate a vintage Burgundy.

46
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:21,244
Yes, we're very big
on vintage beverages.

47
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:25,866
In our storage bin we've got a case
of Tab from the Bay of Pigs.

48
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:28,185
All right. Maxwell, I'll meet
you at the station.

49
00:03:28,185 --> 00:03:31,231
I want to pick up the perfect
hostess gift for the Shallots.

50
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:35,963
What do you think would just make
their weekend? / Miss the train.

51
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:31,704
This will be a great party, a bunch of
60-year-old ladies pinching my cheeks.

52
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,600
Learn to love it. That's as close
to a woman as you'll ever get.

53
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:41,195
I have two words for you.
Cousin Irvie.

54
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:44,972
Just think of this party as
an educational experience.

55
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:49,102
Pretend you're Dian Fossey
observing the gorillas.

56
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,965
Just don't get too close when they eat.
You could lose a hand that way.

57
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:56,258
What's all that gunk
at the bottom of the bottle?

58
00:04:56,258 --> 00:05:00,803
Um, honey, that's the best part.
It's the wine concentrate.

59
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:06,570
Oh, my God. What are you doing
with Mr. Sheffield's best Burgundy?

60
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,320
I'm making a sangria.

61
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:14,413
Does it need more Equal?

62
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,578
Two more packs.

63
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:19,662
Oh, Miss Fine, using that
wine to make sangria

64
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:24,284
is like asking Pavarotti
to sing "Muscrat Love."

65
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,354
He should only have the career
Captain and Tonille.

66
00:05:30,354 --> 00:05:35,807
Oh, kids, before I forget, go dig out
my Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass album.

67
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:39,421
I really want this party to cook.

68
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,718
Oh, Niles, I thought
that you made dip.

69
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,433
I did. That's portobello mushrooms,
shallots, and chives.

70
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:52,307
Oh, now, I'm going to have to go to
the store and get some onion soup mix.

71
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:56,512
Oh, I had to get the Pringles anyway.

72
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:00,807
Cheer up. Did I mention my Cousin
Sophie is coming today?

73
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:04,223
Don't tell me. She's smart and has
a wonderful personality.

74
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:09,772
No. She's dumb as a post,
but she's built like a brick —/ Say no more.

75
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:13,220
Just give me a subtle signal.

76
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:20,616
Where's Maxwell? / Oh, I thought
he was meeting you at the station.

77
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:23,806
He already left.
/ Niles!

78
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:26,464
I called and said that
I would pick him up here.

79
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:28,426
I told you to give
him the message.

80
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:31,980
Oh, I thought you said
give him a message.

81
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:35,778
I didn't think that was appropriate.

82
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,858
I'm not going to let anything
bother me this weekend.

83
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,891
As long as I'm here, I might as
well pick up a little wine.

84
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:46,974
Put Maxwell in the mood. Did I tell
you we have a private compartment?

85
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:50,336
And tonight there's a full moon.

86
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:54,377
Well, I hope she packed
a lot of Nair.

87
00:06:57,563 --> 00:07:01,637
Luck be a lady tonight.

88
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:06,315
Luck if you've ever been
a lady to begin with,

89
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:09,272
luck be a lady to —

90
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:17,977
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Oh, no.

91
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:22,936
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. I can't
believe this has happened.

92
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:30,166
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha. Ahhhhhhh.

93
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:40,041
Okay, there must be another
way out of here.

94
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:46,847
Miss Babcock, I OD'd on the Equal.
Could you pass me another bottle of Burgundy?

95
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,488
Oh, Nanny Fine, I love you.

96
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:52,191
You fool ...

97
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:56,138
Boy, do you blow hot and cold.

98
00:07:57,072 --> 00:08:01,996
You know, a lot of women go through their
change early. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

99
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:05,196
You let the door close and now
we're trapped in here,

100
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:11,161
and I'm going to miss my train.
/ Okay, calm down. Don't panic.

101
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:16,098
Maybe I can fix it. Geez ...

102
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:25,256
No ... Help! Help! Help! Help!

103
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:31,737
Save it. No one's going to hear you.
This was originally built as a bomb shelter.

104
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:34,809
Hey, don't underestimate
the power of these adenoids.

105
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:39,197
I once had next door neighbors
that moved closer to the airport.

106
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:44,495
Hey, this room is very small,
isn't it?

107
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:47,247
Why? Are you claustrophobic?
/ Oh, thank you.

108
00:08:47,247 --> 00:08:50,005
Now you put it in my head,

109
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,890
and I'm reliving —
Loeman's — dressing room

110
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,473
— big sale — 200 naked
women all screaming

111
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:02,672
"Where did you find that?"

112
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,996
I was clinging to
my mother's girdle.

113
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:08,473
Dimples, dimples, everywhere.

114
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,892
And not one on the face.

115
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,805
And then, and then, and then ...

116
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:23,468
Look, an alarm box.
You know, if we cut the wires,

117
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:26,520
we can trip the system and
the cops will come and find us.

118
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,668
What have you got?

119
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:32,031
Ah ... Nail clippers!
/ Excellent ...

120
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:43,587
Well, either that alarm
is way too subtle

121
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:45,822
or

122
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:50,767
I cut the fan off.

123
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:55,070
And now we can't breathe.
Oh, by the way ...

124
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,711
What did you do that for?

125
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:05,250
Weren't you hysterical?
/ No.

126
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,925
Oh, my mistake.

127
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:14,998
Remember, when she walks in,

128
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:18,087
we all yell "Surprise."

129
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,266
Why?

130
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:24,680
Because it's your daughter's
50th birthday.

131
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,571
50? She's got brassieres
older than that.

132
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:32,496
If she's 50, then I'm —

133
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:36,585
what do you know, she's 50.

134
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,784
I wonder if my daughter
Fran is home?

135
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:46,765
I will see if she is.

136
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,579
Surprise!

137
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:53,457
Will you wait till she walks in.

138
00:10:57,404 --> 00:10:59,283
Oh, my God.

139
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,791
I had no idea.

140
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:07,724
Look at me. We were on our way
to see "Shore Shank Redemption."

141
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,734
Schmooze, come meet
your Uncle Stanley.

142
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:15,293
What are you talking about?

143
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,567
Just go along with me.

144
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:23,400
Stan, look, Schmooze, you haven't
seen him since he was this tall.

145
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,774
He's getting bar mitzvahed
while you're on your cruise.

146
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:28,720
Sorry I'm going to miss it.

147
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,299
Here. This is from me
and your Aunt Cookie.

148
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,991
Oh, thank you very much.

149
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:39,850
We split everything 50/50.

150
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:46,545
Oh, I can't believe
I'm missing the party.

151
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:51,017
I mean how often does your mother
turn 50? Two, three times?

152
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:56,208
Here, have a drink.
It'll calm you down.

153
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:57,888
I don't drink.

154
00:11:57,888 --> 00:12:01,791
What do you do when
you're tense? / Hair.

155
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:06,920
What?
/ I do hair.

156
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:10,784
Don't even think about it.

157
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:12,761
Fine.

158
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,010
Ninety-nine bottles
of beer on the wall,

159
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,191
ninety-nine bottles of beer —

160
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:23,267
Can you do a nice
little French twist?

161
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:27,333
So severe you want?
Well, let me see what I can do.

162
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:32,090
So tell me, what's doing?

163
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:34,738
I can't believe this is happening.

164
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:38,538
This was supposed to be
the weekend when Maxwell and I ...

165
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:41,425
Go ahead. I'm listening.

166
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:47,529
Well, last time we came this close.
/ Uh-huh. Tilt.

167
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,415
We were coming back from
a production in Sidney

168
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:55,162
when our plane had to make
an emergency landing in the Fiji Islands.

169
00:12:55,162 --> 00:13:00,212
It was off season so it was deserted.
Well, you can use your imagination.

170
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,859
Paint me a picture.
Pretend, I can't.

171
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:07,043
We were in the bar;
we'd had a few cocktails.

172
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:11,838
Maxwell had that look
in his eye. / Uh-huh.

173
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:16,892
Well, he was too much of
a gentleman.

174
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,676
Let me get this straight.

175
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:24,549
He was drunk; you were
the only woman on a deserted island,

176
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:29,072
and he still didn't touch you ...

177
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:34,155
And you thought Gene Shallot
was going to get him in the mood.

178
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,828
I'm very worried about Fran.

179
00:13:44,538 --> 00:13:46,711
Maybe she stopped
to get your present?

180
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:48,955
She already gave me one.

181
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:51,350
What did you get me?

182
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,706
Did you forget, Ma?

183
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:57,000
Forget my little girl?
Don't insult me.

184
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,683
It's out there with
all the other presents.

185
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:01,445
Oh, Ma ...

186
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:04,165
Pssssss.

187
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:10,642
Get out there and put this
on the biggest box.

188
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:32,891
Mint Chocolate Chip,

189
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:36,273
Jamoca Almond Fudge,

190
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:39,542
Pralines and Cream,

191
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:44,006
that's it. That's 30.

192
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:47,678
Oh, my God. They lied.

193
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:53,688
Why? Thirty's a lot.
Is 31 so catchy?

194
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,303
Oh, wait a minute.
I forgot the sherberts.

195
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,868
All right.
I'll start again.

196
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:04,065
Vanilla —
/ Stop it!

197
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:16,349
You know, this reminds me of when Blair
and Tootie got caught in
Mrs. Garrett's walk-in freezer.

198
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:22,572
Thank God Natalie went in for
a midnight snack. Surprise, surprise.

199
00:15:23,743 --> 00:15:27,877
These are the topics
we can no longer discuss.

200
00:15:27,877 --> 00:15:31,196
What Woolite can and cannot do.

201
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,908
Anyone with the last name Cassidy,

202
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:39,731
odd shaped moles on Eastern Europeans.

203
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:43,664
All right. Okay, but you're really
restricting the conversation.

204
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:47,232
Meanwhile, look how gorgeous
your hair looks.

205
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:58,776
I got one word for you.

206
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:01,463
Styrofoam.

207
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:06,421
But that's not biodegradable.
/ Who's asking you to eat it?

208
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,657
Hi. / Hi

209
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,428
What are you doing hiding
over here by yourself?

210
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:16,177
Well, actually, I'm trying to avoid
running into this geek, Irvie.

211
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:19,494
I'm Maggie.
/ I'm Irvie.

212
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,690
Good, Lord.

213
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:31,849
What are you doing home?

214
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,785
Niles, what is going on here?
Look at this place. Where's Miss Fine?

215
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:40,811
Oh, she's missing.
/ Missing?

216
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:43,876
Ssshhh. Keep your voice down, sir.
I don't want to alarm anyone.

217
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:48,828
This is very strange, Niles.
Miss Babcock's gone missing too. / Yippee!

218
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:59,240
Why won't you play truth or dare?
/ Because all your truths are so boring.

219
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:02,388
Come on ...
/ No.

220
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,597
I'll let you do my makeup.
/ Okay.

221
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,962
Okey-dokey. Ask me.
/ Truth or dare.

222
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:15,336
Um, I pick truth.

223
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,016
Okay, if you could spend
the night with anyone,

224
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:24,702
who would it be? We both know.
Game's over. Suck in your cheeks.

225
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:28,427
You never know.
My answer may surprise you.

226
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:30,617
All right. Shoot.

227
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,523
It's Maxwell.

228
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,767
Get out of town.

229
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:41,933
Well, to think that right now we could
both be lying in front of a fire,

230
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:47,772
my head on his chest,
him gently stroking my hair.

231
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:54,907
Honey, take some deep breaths.
You're running out of oxygen.

232
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,293
You're right. Who am I kidding?
He doesn't care about me.

233
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,746
My therapist says
I'm obsessed with him.

234
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,729
How much did you have to
pay to find that out?

235
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:07,074
If only he weren't
so darn attractive.

236
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:10,178
He is cute.
/ Tell me about it.

237
00:18:10,178 --> 00:18:14,271
That little gray streak in his hair
just makes me want to hummmm.

238
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:19,795
Now, you see, that would be
the first thing I'd get rid of.

239
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:24,022
Too Pepy LePew.

240
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:29,295
Have you ever seen him in
a bathing suit? / No. Aha!

241
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,375
Too bad.

242
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:36,548
I've seen him naked, though.
Does that count?

243
00:18:41,673 --> 00:18:46,218
When? / Oh, relax. It was an accident.
I walked in on him in the shower.

244
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,319
Forget it. He locks now.

245
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:56,302
The truth is he's ruined me
for other men, you know?

246
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,381
You? Next to Mr. Sheffield,

247
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:01,912
all the guys that I date seem
like real morons.

248
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:07,705
Gee, I wonder if that's cause
all the guys that I date are morons?

249
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:14,649
At least you date. I'm going to wake up
one morning a dried-up old spinster.

250
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,903
Quiet. Wait.

251
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:20,650
Oh, if that didn't bring Niles down,
we're doomed.

252
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,108
Who cares. I might as well die.
Then I can at least haunt Maxwell.

253
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:29,734
And don't think I won't be shaking
a few chains in the butler's pantry.

254
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:32,430
Stop it. You're scaring me.

255
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,169
Oh, who cares, Nanny Fine, face it,

256
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,737
get out of this house while you can,
or you're going to end up just like me.

257
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:40,346
No!

258
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:44,428
Oh, there you are. We've been
looking all over for you.

259
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:47,827
Hey, stand back. Stay away from us,
you destroyer of girls' lives.

260
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:50,318
What? / Go, tell him, sister.

261
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:54,425
Maxwell, thank God ...

262
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,326
She never shuts up.

263
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:59,913
She's been saying
the most terrible things about you.

264
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:03,518
Ladies, ladies, calm down. Let's go upstairs
where we can talk about this.

265
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:06,446
You're obviously very shaken
after your ordeal —

266
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:09,893
Cee Cee, have you done
something with your hair?

267
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,410
Miss Babcock ...
/ What?

268
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,040
You left your purse.

269
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:25,621
Darling, this was
the best party ever.

270
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,551
Oh, thanks, Mom.

271
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:31,007
You know, next year I think we should
invest in a new "Happy 50th Banner."

272
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:33,977
This one says "Vote Dukakis"
on the back.

273
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,407
Good night.
/ Good night.

274
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:47,311
So, Niles, did you let it out?
/ Yes. And the villagers were not happy.

275
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,681
Meanwhile, where have
you been for the last hour?

276
00:20:55,097 --> 00:20:59,879
So you met my Cousin Sophie,
nice, huh? / Yousa!

277
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:05,182
Oh, come on, Yetta,
Daddy's honking.

278
00:21:05,366 --> 00:21:07,393
Thank you for a lovely evening.

279
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:10,745
And if you find
a nice diamond cocktail ring,

280
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:13,382
you could send it
to me at the home.

281
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:16,243
Yetta, you don't
have a diamond cocktail ring.

282
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:19,517
I'm just saying if you find one.

283
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:25,989
Some night, huh?
/ What?

284
00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:29,940
Well, I just can't help thinking about you
and Miss Babcock being stuck together.

285
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,163
I mean, what on earth did
you find to talk about?

286
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:37,288
Oh, you know, this and that.
Your hair came up.

287
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,418
Really? / Yeah, she don't like it.
She thinks you look like Pepy LePew

288
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:48,445
Miss Fine, can I tell you
something in confidence?

289
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:52,481
It's, it's about Miss Babcock.
/ I'm all ears.

290
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:56,938
Well, I, I rather think
she has a thing for me.

291
00:21:56,938 --> 00:22:00,089
Get out of town.

292
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,473
Well, since we're exchanging
confidences, she did mention

293
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:08,915
that close encounter on Fiji.

294
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:12,643
Oh, I remember that.
/ Cocktails in the bar?

295
00:22:12,643 --> 00:22:16,912
No, quinine at the British Consulate.
I was taken deathly ill.

296
00:22:16,912 --> 00:22:19,860
They rushed me to the hospital.
I was delirious for days.

297
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,998
Well, apparently delirium
ran rampant on that trip.

298
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:27,485
Beg your pardon?
/ Oh, nothing.

299
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:31,203
I'm just sorry that you had to miss
your weekend at Gene Shallot's.

300
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:34,017
Actually, I felt like
I was there.

301
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:37,669
Your Aunt Ida bears
a striking resemblance to him.

302
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:42,600
You know, I told her,
if she was going to dye her hair,

303
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,025
do the mustache too.

304
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,531
That's 75 for you

305
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:01,205
and 185 for me.

306
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:04,920
Hey, you said 50/50.
That's not fair.

307
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:10,225
Let's talk fair. You live in a mansion.
I live in a home.

308
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:16,040
You got your whole life ahead of you.
I got one, two weeks tops.

309
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,925
You can eat corn.
Here, let me show you something.

310
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:23,414
Oh, take it. Take it all.
