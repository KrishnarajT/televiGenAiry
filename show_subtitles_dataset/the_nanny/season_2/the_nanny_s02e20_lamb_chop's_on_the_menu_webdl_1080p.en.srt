00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,708
Excuse me, Mr. Sheffield.

3
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:08,001
I just wanted to tell you that Tuesday
I have to take my mother to the Bunion Center.

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,574
Oh, thank heavens you told me.

5
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:14,208
Ah, meeting with Liza Minelli,
conference with Donald Trump,

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:18,418
Miss Fine and mother at Bunion Center.

7
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:20,579
Mr. Sheffield, it's serious.

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,075
The woman has a thumb growing
off the side of her foot.

9
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:28,958
She can't even fit into her socks
anymore. She has to wear a mitten.

10
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:33,828
God, I have to move out of my apartment to get
my floors redone, and I cannot find a kennel.

11
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:37,576
Oh, treat yourself to a hotel.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,551
Not me. My dog.

13
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:47,975
Chester? You're going to put
Chester into cage a somewhere?

14
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:54,777
Oh, I think that's terrible to take a dog
out of his warm and loving environment. Huh?

15
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,899
Well, anyway,
you still shouldn't do it.

16
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,335
My Uncle Manny put his dog into a kennel,
and he was never the same again.

17
00:01:02,335 --> 00:01:05,432
Would you like to know what happened?

18
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,316
Not really.

19
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:12,209
He put his German shepherd, King,
in a cage with male poodles.

20
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,365
P.S., all hopes of breeding
him were over.

21
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:19,445
Oh, for heaven sake.
He's a small dog.

22
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,845
He fits in a wet bar frig.

23
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,582
Never mind how I know that.

24
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:29,090
Hello?

25
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,864
Ah, Miss Babcock, why don't you just leave
Chester here with us for a couple of days?

26
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:36,173
That is a wonderful idea.

27
00:01:36,173 --> 00:01:40,059
Well, you know how much he loves me,
and he really wouldn't be any bother at all.

28
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:44,095
Oh, you don't mind, do you, Maxwell?
/ No, no, of course not.

29
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,699
Oh, well, terrific. I'll just
run home and get him.

30
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:49,602
He really won't be any trouble.
He even knows how to do tricks.

31
00:01:49,602 --> 00:01:52,706
He can lie down, roll over, and beg.

32
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:56,009
Gee, I wonder where he learned that.

33
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,699
Fran ...
/ Hi, honey.

34
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:53,045
Fran, you remember that gorgeous guy
I told you about?

35
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:58,415
Oh, sweetie, that's like asking me if
I remember when they cut up my credit card.

36
00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:02,097
Jeremy Thatcher, math, third period,
hair like Brad Pitt.

37
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:04,683
Up to speed. / Well, I —

38
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:06,737
Hello, sweetheart.

39
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:08,643
Hi, Dad.

40
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:18,978
Oh, sweetheart, there's nothing you
can't share with your father.

41
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,864
It's a female thing.

42
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:24,581
Carry on.

43
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:28,521
Boy, if ever they run out of starter
flags at the Indy 500,

44
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:32,968
all they gotta do is yell, "It's a female
thing," and watch those men take off.

45
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:38,014
Anyways, I think he's going to ask me out
because he asked for my phone number. / Ahhhh ...

46
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm going to stay home all day in case he calls.
/ Oh, no, honey, you don't want to appear too anxious.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,495
I mean, it's better to play hard to get.

48
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:46,844
That could be him. Go, go, go.

49
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:53,213
Maxwell ...
/ Oh, Chester ... Sweetie.

50
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,618
Be care. He's been in
a foul mood all day.

51
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:01,667
Oh, you know, if he had
a little more hair on his back,

52
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,584
he could be my ex-boyfriend.

53
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,148
All right. Enough already.
Come to mama.

54
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:17,539
Oh, Maxwell, thank God you're here.
I was having lunch at Fontina
with a William Morris agent,

55
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:21,760
and, well, to make a long story short —
/ Take note of how she does this Miss Fine.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,363
I just nailed down the rights
to our first feature film.

57
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:29,684
C.C., what would we want with film rights?
We're theater producers.

58
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:32,659
Oh, Maxwell, the theater's dying.
It's time we branched out.

59
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,444
You know, I'm with
Miss Babcock on that one.

60
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:37,993
I mean, when you're paying 65 bucks
to see Brook Shields singing in pedal pushers,

61
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:41,091
you know the end is near.

62
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:48,539
All right. So what film have
we bought the rights to?

63
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:51,980
"Lamb Chop, the Movie."

64
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:56,271
Oh, that is so exciting.

65
00:04:56,271 --> 00:05:00,195
You know, when I was a little girl,
we couldn't afford a Lamb Chop doll

66
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:04,546
so Grandma Yetta would put on a white curly
wig, and then she'd take her teeth out,

67
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:09,386
and grandpa would stick his
hand up her blouse ...

68
00:05:12,173 --> 00:05:18,342
Gee, come to think of it, I think there
was a good time had by all.

69
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:25,470
So let me get this straight, C.C. I have
worked with Gielgood, Burton, Olivier;

70
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,571
and now I'm producing a film starring a sock?

71
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:36,408
Maxwell, last year that sock topped
a hundred million in merchandising.

72
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:40,963
Children, guess what. You're going
to meet Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop.

73
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:44,762
Oh, Lamb Chop. I just love her.

74
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,489
You know, if Lamb Chop had
married Howdy Doody,

75
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:50,471
her name would be Lamb Doody.

76
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:57,116
I really killed them with
that in kindergarten.

77
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,067
Answer phones on what telethon, Ma?

78
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:11,140
I said Shari Lewis is coming to
the house, not Jerry Lewis. Oy ...

79
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,558
Miss Fine! / Oh, Ma, I gotta go.
Something just hit the fan.

80
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:18,723
The category is dog.

81
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:22,778
Now for 20 points, can anyone tell
me what's on the bottom of my wing tip?

82
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:27,406
Ah, I believe the young lady with
the big hair buzzed in first.

83
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:31,299
Did Chester leave you a little gift?
/ Ssshhh!

84
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:37,009
Miss Fine, I think he meant for it to be
a secret because he hid it under my desk.

85
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,512
Well, if I can scrape it out of
your gym bag, you certainly —

86
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,995
oh, is that —

87
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:47,029
is that picture crooked over there?

88
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:51,768
Miss Fine, would you please keep
that dog's bowels under control.

89
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:56,273
Oh, is this the biggest
gross-out in the world.

90
00:06:56,273 --> 00:07:01,498
And yet you spread it over a garden
and you get a tomato the size of your head.

91
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:05,922
Oop. Here you go, Niles.
I'll get the door.

92
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:09,230
So this means Mr. Sheffield is
in his stocking feet,

93
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,288
and I have yet to clean up Chester's
other little deposit in the — Ohhh!

94
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:17,475
— in the hall.

95
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:22,563
Oh, my God, it's Shari Lewis.

96
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:30,883
Hello.

97
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,897
I saw your lips move.

98
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:39,523
Oh, hello, Miss Chop. I'm Fran Fine,
and I must tell you

99
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:43,339
that I have been a fan of yours ever
since I was a little girl.

100
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,037
Ever sinse you were —

101
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:53,032
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
That is unpossible.

102
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:56,276
I'm only six.

103
00:07:56,489 --> 00:08:02,065
Oh, come on, I used to watch you on
my black and white TV — / I'm only six.

104
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:06,216
Oh, I get it. That's okay.

105
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:09,828
My mother counts in lamb years too.

106
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,855
Shari, welcome. Maxwell Sheffield.

107
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:16,527
Oh, how do you do? Ummm, ahhhh.

108
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:20,149
Mr. Sheffield, don't snub the lamb.

109
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:23,279
She's the whole show.

110
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:28,222
Oh, of course. Ah, Maxwell Sheffield.

111
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:31,696
Enchante, I'm sure.

112
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:42,369
Well, Shari, if you wouldn't mind,
my little girl is just dying to meet you.

113
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:47,732
Cute touche.
/ Lamb Chop.

114
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:52,572
I'd follow him to school one day.
/ Oh ...

115
00:08:53,684 --> 00:08:58,680
Get the feeling Lamb Chop's fleece
is not as white as snow?

116
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:06,130
What grade are you in?
/ My grade is USDA. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

117
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:12,548
Huh? / Hello. Is this thing be turned on?

118
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:15,653
Miss Lewis ...
/ Oh, thank you.

119
00:09:15,653 --> 00:09:18,940
Oh, is that for me?
/ I'll get you something, Lamb Chop.

120
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,498
How about Woolite on the rocks?

121
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:26,647
I work alone, Benson.

122
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:36,420
Now he's upset the lamb.
You better go over and pet her.

123
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:38,735
Miss Fine, I'm not petting a puppet.

124
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,286
Why? She's a big star.

125
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:43,705
I'll bet once in a while they
all need stroking.

126
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:46,803
I didn't pet Gielgood or Olivier.
/ Well, maybe if you did,

127
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:50,091
you wouldn't be making
"Lamb Chop, the Movie."

128
00:09:51,906 --> 00:09:56,267
Oh, oh. Ahhhhhh.

129
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,263
Oh ...

130
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:03,067
Oh, that was nice. Don't stop.

131
00:10:03,657 --> 00:10:05,733
Hello, hello.

132
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,862
Sorry I'm late.

133
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:10,463
Hello, Miss Lewis.
C.C. Babcock.

134
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:13,433
Oh, hello.
/ Ahhhhhhh!

135
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:20,067
Ahhhhhhh!
/ What?

136
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:25,908
What did I do?
/ Miss Babcock, your coat.

137
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,352
New Zealand lamb?
/ So?

138
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:36,958
Maybe she had people there?
/ Ohhhhhh!

139
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:41,538
Take it off.

140
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:45,102
Three words she doesn't hear often.

141
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,895
Yes!

142
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:51,011
Niles, isn't that sweet.

143
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:53,947
You're bonding with the sheep.

144
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:56,925
Not the first time I'm sure.

145
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:01,028
Bravo.

146
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:03,522
You win.

147
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,951
Every dog has her day.

148
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:15,526
Maxwell, you have a beautiful house.
And I want to thank you for inviting us.

149
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:19,942
We're delighted Shari. Besides,
I always find hotels a little impersonal.

150
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:26,700
Ah, speak for yourself. At a hotel
at least I could get a massage. Ahhhhh!

151
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:31,673
And you could use a manicure.
Ohhhhh.

152
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:37,256
Anyway, Shari, I have — I have some
wonderful ideas for this film.

153
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:40,781
And I've got a few ideas of my own.

154
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:46,298
My room, later.

155
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,920
Better wear a rubber glove.

156
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:07,280
Why didn't you make outside?
/ I didn't have to go that bad.

157
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:13,090
Not you, Val. Oh, Niles,
he didn't do his business.

158
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,176
Well, that's not his territory.
Perhaps if you moved the Persian rug outside.

159
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:22,265
Aha. Gee, I don't know what's
wrong with him, Val.

160
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:27,039
He had his whole meal — ate
two slippers, Brighten's homework,

161
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,227
and the Theater Guild award Mr. Sheffield
had that sick attachment to.

162
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:35,206
Fran, I can't believe it.
It finally happened.

163
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:37,727
Oh, honey, you're a year
younger than when I —

164
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,861
wait a minute.
What finally happened?

165
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:44,852
Jeremy finally asked me out.
We're going to a retro drive-in movie.

166
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:49,681
Oh, a drive-in. Oh, honey.
What kind of car does he drive?

167
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,625
A Miatta.
/ Four on the floor.

168
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,981
No back seat.
/ Have fun.

169
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,179
So where's Shari?
/ Oh, she's on business.

170
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:02,213
But Lamb Chop's here.
/ Oh, I get to meet Lamb Chop.

171
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:05,051
Oh, I promise,
I won't say anything stupid.

172
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,776
Too late Val.

173
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:18,916
Isn't that adorable?

174
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,013
Bordering on psychotic, but adorable.

175
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,995
Ssshhh! Ssshhh! Don't wake her up.

176
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:29,651
Val, Led Zeplin couldn't wake her up.

177
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:32,299
Oh, look.
/ What?

178
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:34,555
Look, her little dresses.

179
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:38,010
How come she never wears them?

180
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,350
Val, these are Shari's.
/ Oh ...

181
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,120
I don't know what you're so shocked about.
She's very petite. / Oh ...

182
00:13:46,548 --> 00:13:48,076
Ohhhhh ...

183
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,124
Chester!

184
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:56,655
Chester,

185
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:59,581
put Lamb Chop down.

186
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:06,638
Come to Auntie Frannie.

187
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:10,587
Val, don't make any sudden moves.

188
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,084
Chester!

189
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:17,569
Chester, there he is.
Come here. Come here.

190
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:20,474
Oh, Chester.
What did you do with —

191
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:23,070
oh, Val ...

192
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:28,366
Chester ate Lamb Chop.

193
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:39,411
Come on, Chester, purge, purge.

194
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:45,417
You want me to stick your paw
down your throat? / Ha, ha, ha, ha.

195
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:50,426
Niles, it's not funny.
/ Oh, no, you're right. It's a tragedy.

196
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:53,363
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

197
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:58,514
Oh, and you know what
the worst part of it all is?

198
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:01,436
Just because I suggested that
Chester come stay with us

199
00:15:01,436 --> 00:15:06,300
and I brought him up to Shari's room and
put him down so I could rifle
through her personal stuff,

200
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,040
Mr. Sheffield's going to find
some crazy way of blaming this all on me.

201
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,492
No, you know what the worst part it.

202
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:18,317
He forgot the mint jelly.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

203
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,282
Stop it.

204
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:26,969
It's not funny.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

205
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:33,356
Do you think that when Shari finds
out that Lamb Chop was eaten

206
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:37,026
it's going to blow the movie deal?

207
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:42,734
What?
/ I was just asking Niles — Ohhhhh!

208
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:47,574
Maxwell! / Head her off,
Miss Fine. You can do it.

209
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:51,107
Well, Miss Fine,
do you have anything to say?

210
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:54,872
Ah, you missed a belt loop?

211
00:16:56,357 --> 00:17:00,369
Oh, Mr. Sheffield,
why aren't you saying anything?

212
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:04,126
You're scaring me. I like it
better when you yell and scream.

213
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:08,093
Please, let it out.
/ That's right, Maxwell. Let it out.

214
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:12,561
Let's not forget who's
responsible for all of this.

215
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:15,669
Your dog.
/ Right.

216
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:23,369
So, Miss Fine, what — what
would you like me to say, huh?

217
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:26,651
I mean, my film career's
over before it began.

218
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:30,719
Oh, let's not be nay sayers.

219
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:34,309
He ate the bloody star.

220
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:38,162
All right. Now you're back with me.

221
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,144
Apparently, it's your fault.

222
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:44,486
You were responsible for
that fur-covered colon.

223
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:51,763
Well, I said it. I knew you'd
find a way to blame this on me.

224
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:54,244
Yes, she did, sir.

225
00:17:56,227 --> 00:18:00,317
But I've got a plan.
/ Yes, she does, sir.

226
00:18:01,398 --> 00:18:05,206
And, as you know, my plans never fail.

227
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:16,258
Eyelash ...

228
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,016
hot glue ...

229
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:21,949
puff ...

230
00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:28,425
Oh, no. Oh, God, are you insane?

231
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:33,711
Mr. Sheffield, trust me. I once
accidentally destroyed my father's toupee,

232
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:38,879
and I made an exact replica out
of the toilet seat cover.

233
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:42,960
That looked real?
/ Yeah.

234
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,766
Plus he matched the towels.

235
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:49,598
That's all right, Miss Lewis.
I'll get it for you.

236
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:51,357
Incoming.

237
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,064
Thank you very much, Niles.
/ Uh-huh.

238
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,955
Ohhhhhh!

239
00:18:58,316 --> 00:19:00,230
Didn't you see me?

240
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,171
What's your point?

241
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:10,020
Hi, Shari. We were just sitting
around here talking with Lamb Chop.

242
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,875
You know, I gave her a makeover,

243
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:20,240
make her hair a little higher
to balance out the mutton thighs.

244
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:23,712
What have you done with her?
This isn't my Lamb Chop.

245
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:27,137
Why? I think she's got
a refreshing, earthy quality.

246
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:30,074
Fran chop. Aha.

247
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,294
Shari, I'm afraid we owe
you a bit of an explanation.

248
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:35,842
You think?

249
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:39,620
Oh, Miss Lewis, you really
shouldn't be angry at Mr. Sheffield.

250
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,498
The truth of the matter is
her dog ate Lamb Chop.

251
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:51,218
You know, Shari, the lamb was
holding you back.

252
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:58,094
You're better off without her.
She told me she was seeing another hand.

253
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,357
You know, I know that you've
experienced a great loss, Miss Lewis,

254
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:07,653
but you really shouldn't blame
Miss Babcock,

255
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:11,990
although you've got
a very legitimate case against her.

256
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:18,036
Miss Fine, perhaps Miss Lewis would
like a moment of silence for the lamb —

257
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:24,647
Look, Lamb Chop!

258
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,256
Oh, Lamb Chop.

259
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,454
Oh, look, Chester didn't eat her.

260
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:36,415
You know, he must have dropped her down
the laundry chute like I used to do to Grace —

261
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:42,915
geez. Me, I haven't done
my homework yet. Let's go.

262
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:47,906
Yuk, poo-poo-poo,
yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk, yuk.

263
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,463
Well, thank goodness she's okay.

264
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:54,067
Yeah. Okay? Speak for yourself.

265
00:20:54,067 --> 00:21:00,198
I was practically strangled
by a leopard thong bikini.

266
00:21:01,232 --> 00:21:04,090
Oh, sorry.

267
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:10,829
Oh, Shari, I'm most terribly sorry
about all this. You know —

268
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:14,176
Oh, forget it. I want out of this deal.

269
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:17,334
Lamb Chop, let's not be hasty.

270
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:21,793
Let's not forget
who owns 52 percent.

271
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:24,563
We're out of here.

272
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:27,104
Well, look, if she doesn't want to do it,
she doesn't want to do it.

273
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:31,484
I'm — I'm really sorry. / You'll have
to get Miss Piggy for your project.

274
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:33,587
Miss Piggy?

275
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:36,702
That ham?

276
00:21:37,204 --> 00:21:40,701
Honey, she's the new white meat.

277
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:47,456
You know, maybe you are overreacting?

278
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:52,279
Well, why don't we step into
my office and discuss this?

279
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:57,957
Well ... there's no harm in just talking.

280
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:02,260
Shall we? / Hey, shall we?

281
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,091
Come here. How's my breath?

282
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:06,628
It's all right? / It's all right.

283
00:22:06,628 --> 00:22:08,884
Good girl. Go. Go.

284
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:16,501
Excuse me, but this is
a private meeting.

285
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:38,722
You know that guy I'm going to the drive-in
movie with? / Yeah. The one with the Miatta.

286
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:43,052
Well, the Miatta's in the shop.
So he's bringing his father's Lincoln.

287
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:47,538
Oh, better, big back seat. What movie
you seeing? / "Legends of the Fall."

288
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:50,581
Oh, sexy. We're going
to have such a good time.

289
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:53,855
Kids — Brighten, Gracie,

290
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:56,833
we're going to a drive-in.
