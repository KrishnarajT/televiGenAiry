1
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:08,662
Oh, Miss Fine, is it that time
of the month again?

2
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:12,939
Oh, I'm afraid so, Niles.

3
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:16,474
Time to make my credit card payments.

4
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:21,001
Oh, thank God I've got a system.

5
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,832
No, you don't. I'm tapped.
/ Not you.

6
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:32,598
I have to pay my American Express because
if I buy a piece of gum,
the SWAT team storms the building.

7
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:35,784
Meanwhile, I pay my Master
card with my Discover card,

8
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:39,030
my Discover card with my Optimer,

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,536
my Optimer card with my City Trust Visa.

10
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:46,638
But doesn't that leave a very
high balance on your Visa?

11
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:50,077
Exactly. And that's why they
give me an expresso machine,

12
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:55,441
which I sell to pay
my American Express. Thank you.

13
00:00:55,592 --> 00:01:00,060
Miss Fine, you should be
President of Mexico.

14
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:04,302
Daddy, I need some money.
/ Oh, of course, sweetheart. Here you are.

15
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:09,223
Oh, boy, you're lucky.
My father was never so generous with me,

16
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:13,052
unless he was asleep and his pants
were hanging on the back of a chair.

17
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:16,436
Fran, it's only $50.
/ Only $50.

18
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:22,033
Do you know how many kids Sally
Struthers could feed for $50?

19
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:27,703
Although, have you seen her lately?
Do we really think she's feeding anyone else?

20
00:01:31,548 --> 00:01:33,998
Well, you know, Margaret,
Miss Fine does have a valid point.

21
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:37,432
I gave you $50 just yesterday.
Now what did you do with it?

22
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:39,359
I spent it on clothes for school.

23
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,408
Oh, well, there you are.
You see, she spent it on clothes for school —

24
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:44,041
don't you have a uniform?

25
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:48,811
Dad, don't be mean.
I love you so much.

26
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:52,939
All right. But this is the last time.

27
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,890
Oy ...
/ What?

28
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,647
Well, you know, I don't want
to derail the gravy train,

29
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:02,035
but don't you think it's time
that the kid got a job?

30
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,356
Okay. I'll get a job.
I'll go work at the Gap.

31
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:07,179
Wait a minute. Isn't that where
your boyfriend Peter works?

32
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:09,955
Oh, is it?

33
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:17,293
Honey, honey, let me handle this.
You're opening up a whole Endora's box over here.

34
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:23,297
Mr. Sheffield, all I'm saying is that
I think a job would teach her responsibility.

35
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:26,971
Yeah, well, I'm all for that.
I just think she may be too
young to start working.

36
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:31,893
Well, you're not doing her any favors
by handing her everything on a silver platter.

37
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:34,142
Thank you, Niles.

38
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:39,195
I don't know, Miss Fine. I just don't
feel right about Margaret taking a job

39
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:41,910
away from someone who
could really use the money.

40
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,833
Well, okay. Ah, have her
do volunteer work.

41
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,274
Yeah, I can do volunteer — what?

42
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:54,942
No, no, no, no. I'm rich.

43
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:58,402
You won't be rich until I'm dead.

44
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:01,995
Ah, don't go there, Mr. Sheffield.

45
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:07,152
I have the feeling Mr. Menendez
used that logic on Lyle and Eric.

46
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:04,346
Sorry I'm late, Maxwell.
My cooking class ran over.

47
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:07,201
Taste this. Taste it.

48
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,048
Ummm ...

49
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:17,417
Oh, let me give you
a tortilla for dipping.

50
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:22,469
Oh ...

51
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,101
Well, go on. Dip.

52
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,573
Knock-knock.
/ Oh, Miss Fine, come in.

53
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:38,243
Guess who got a new job.

54
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:41,270
Hallelujah, Nanny Fine.

55
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:45,560
Don't even give two weeks notice.
Girl, you just go go go.

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,566
And as a token of my appreciation ...

57
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:52,715
Oh, Miss Babcock, it's gorgeous.

58
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:55,705
I don't know what to say.
Oh, yes, I do.

59
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:59,367
I'm not the one with
the new job. Maggie is.

60
00:05:00,086 --> 00:05:02,581
Self-winding.

61
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:07,584
Well, Maggie's going to be a candy
striper at Bellmont Hospital.

62
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:11,163
I got her the gig through this
doctor I once broke up with.

63
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:14,320
You broke up with a doctor?

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,068
Uh-huh. A very successful
anethesiologist.

65
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:23,210
But when I went out with him,
I didn't feel anything.

66
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:29,015
Miss — Miss Fine, do you really think
Margaret's responsible enough
to be working in a hospital?

67
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:33,744
Oh, what's the worse that could happen?
She'll forget to bring someone their Jell-O snack?

68
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:36,010
See that aquarium?

69
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,163
What aquarium? There's no fish in there.

70
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:41,847
Yeah. Margaret forgot to bring
them their Jell-O snacks.

71
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:47,506
Well, this is different.

72
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:50,546
This job is going to help
build her character.

73
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:54,592
She's going to wake up every morning
with a purpose — to help people,

74
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:59,341
to marry a doctor, to move to Great
Neck, to drive a Caddy SDS

75
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:04,573
with a North Star engine and make her
cousin Martha so jealous.

76
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,042
Oh, sorry. I'm back.

77
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:14,225
Oh, Miss Babcock, is your dog here?

78
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:22,903
Chester? He's not here. / Oh, well,
then, what's with the Cycle 2?

79
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:27,251
I made that in cooking class, Nanny Fine,

80
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:30,511
who knows nothing about ode cuisine.

81
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:36,667
Well, I know when food's supposed to be
served in a bowl with a name on it. / Huh.

82
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,260
Oh, honey, this job is going to
just do wonders for you.

83
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,914
And besides, it's really good
karma to help people in need.

84
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:52,482
Oh, just look at that woman over there.

85
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:56,065
Let's go over and cheer
her up a little bit.

86
00:06:56,672 --> 00:07:00,872
Hi ... You know,
things can't be that bad.

87
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:03,800
And when you look good,

88
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,929
you feel good.

89
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:14,207
There ... Oh, she's going to feel
much better about herself now.

90
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:22,118
Oh, excuse me. I need a doctor.

91
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:26,942
What are your symptoms?
/ I'm 30 and single. Ha, ha, ha.

92
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:30,974
Oh, that's funny. 30.

93
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:38,197
Anyway, this is Maggie Sheffield.
Your new candy striper.

94
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:39,253
Hi.

95
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:42,609
Now, Maggie, this is a hospital and
things can get pretty rough around here.

96
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:47,083
Are you sure you're up for this?
/ Excuse me for a moment.

97
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,377
Fran, I don't know.
Maybe Dad was right.

98
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:52,625
Oh, No. 1, don't ever
say that again.

99
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:57,931
No. 2, we prepared for this.
How many Rescue 911's did we watch?

100
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:00,801
I know. But this is real. That's fake.

101
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:05,358
Honey, 911 is not fake.
It's a reenactment of an actual event.

102
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:08,590
Only with better looking people.

103
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,890
Oh, now, don't get nervous.
That's just a needle.

104
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,514
I know.

105
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:17,563
Don't let it get to you.
/ I won't.

106
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,774
You okay?

107
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:22,628
Yeah.
/ Good. See ya.

108
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:24,860
Fran?

109
00:08:29,095 --> 00:08:31,991
Oh, Peter, this job gets
more amazing every day.

110
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:34,764
Make that pouty face.

111
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:38,948
Peter, I'm serious.
This lady came out of surgery,

112
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:41,184
and I was there when
she opened her eyes.

113
00:08:41,184 --> 00:08:46,658
Oh, you should have seen her face when
I said her thighs already look smaller.

114
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,260
Maggie,

115
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:56,118
what's the number of that
pizza place that delivers?

116
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:58,935
No, no, not that one.

117
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:02,526
The one on 57th. Oh, never mind.
I'll look it up.

118
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,915
Oh, what do you want on it.

119
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:12,955
Oh, can't we split the diff?
Can't we do half pepperoni,
half Canadian bacon?

120
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,373
What do you want, Brighten?

121
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:17,021
Put me down for a calzone.

122
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,671
Brighten ...

123
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:25,979
Oh hi, Mr. Sheffield. How was
your dinner at Miss Babcock's.
What'd she serve?

124
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,693
Well, I'm not quite sure,

125
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:31,357
but I have a feeling I'll be tasting
it again later this evening.

126
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:36,376
Well, judging by the hour, you must
have liked it well enough to have
stayed for seconds.

127
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:39,245
What's wrong with him?

128
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,436
Well, you know, you come home
smelling of another chef's cooking.

129
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:47,563
You got sauce on your collar.
I mean, he's not stupid.

130
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,723
Miss Fine, do you happen to have
anything for an upset stomach?

131
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:54,415
Oh, of course. Let me go see here.

132
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:59,157
I've got Gas X, Rolaids, Mylanta —

133
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:05,747
mint and the new cherry flavor.
Are you — are you gassy or just bloated?

134
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,416
I'd like to keep some mystery between us.
Why don't you just surprise me ...

135
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:13,332
Thank you.

136
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,803
I see Peter and Margaret
haven't left the couch.

137
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:21,108
Don't worry.
I've been in the room all night.

138
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:23,522
Fran, Fran, hurry up.
The commercial's over.

139
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:27,028
Honey, you're having a nightmare.
Go back to bed.

140
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:31,733
Good evening, Mr. Sheffield.
/ Oh, hello, Peter.

141
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,896
It's a lovely shade of lip
gloss you're wearing.

142
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,783
Thank you, sir.

143
00:10:37,696 --> 00:10:40,650
Meanwhile, have you asked your
daughter how's the hospital —

144
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,325
five days in a row, never late.

145
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:47,839
And you'll never hear out of
my mouth, "I told you so."

146
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:50,953
Oh, tell him about the lady who
just came back from the Amazon.

147
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:55,152
Oh, my gosh, this weird bug laid
eggs in this lady's cheek,

148
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:57,777
and they started to hatch.
/ Ohhhh ...

149
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,407
Excuse me.
/ Oh ...

150
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,053
Why doesn't anyone want
to hear about my job?

151
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:09,561
I can't wait to get back to
the hospital tomorrow night.

152
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:13,944
But I got us tickets to Meat Puppets.
/ Hey, it's not like they're paying me.

153
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:19,231
Look, I'm sure I can find somebody
to fill in for me. But who?

154
00:11:22,331 --> 00:11:23,634
Call you later.

155
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,276
Good night, Peter. / Bye-bye.

156
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:28,600
Ah, Fran, I need a favor.

157
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,100
Um, how should I put this.

158
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,662
Ah, imagine if you were young ...

159
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:36,135
Honey, don't get creative.

160
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,516
Just tell me.

161
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:42,227
I can't work tomorrow night because
Peter asked me to a concert,

162
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:44,949
but I'm going to get somebody
I really trust to cover for me.

163
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:49,589
Oh, well, if you've got somebody
you really trust — oh, no.

164
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,770
Oh, come on, Fran.
It's our eight-week anniversary.

165
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,023
Eight. Already?
What is that? Lint?

166
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:08,368
Honey, nobody is going to believe
that I'm a candy striper.

167
00:12:08,368 --> 00:12:11,372
Fran, you could pass for 16.

168
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:14,451
16? No way.

169
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:18,606
18, maybe.

170
00:12:19,401 --> 00:12:22,877
But I'm supposed to be teaching
you responsibility.

171
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:25,115
Fran, don't be mean.

172
00:12:25,115 --> 00:12:28,492
I love you so much.

173
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:33,948
Honey, that only works
on your father. / Please ...

174
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:42,341
Oh, all right, but just this one time.
/ Oh, thank you so much, Fran.

175
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:46,591
Now I know that you told him that
I wouldn't flake out,
so we don't have to tell him.

176
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:49,926
Oh, no. Don't start lying
to your father now.

177
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:53,860
Save that for when you come home
wearing your shirt inside out.

178
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:56,435
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I gotta talk to you.

179
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:58,807
No. No, Miss Fine. Me first.

180
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:02,069
I want to tell you what a wonderful
job you've done with Margaret.

181
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:05,475
You know, I've been trying for years
to teach that child responsibility.

182
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:09,520
And you waltz in the front door
and accomplish it just like that.

183
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,118
Well, you're a remarkable young woman.

184
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:14,831
What are you going to do next?

185
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:18,373
Ah, I'm going to Disneyland.

186
00:13:31,464 --> 00:13:35,085
Hey, Fran. / Nobody's sneaking
out of the house.

187
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:40,328
Brighten, why aren't you eating in front of
the TV in the living room like a normal kid?

188
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,806
Niles would have a fit.

189
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:45,852
You know, we spend thousands of
dollars to Skotchguard the furniture,

190
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:48,972
and everybody's afraid to see
if it works. Come on.

191
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,710
Good-bye.

192
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:59,526
Rum-pum-pum.

193
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,697
Oh, hi, Niles. You know,
I'm glad you're here

194
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:09,008
because Brighten is eating in the living room

195
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,181
What time do you have to be
at the hospital?

196
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:16,148
6:00. And I'm already —
oh, how'd you know?

197
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:18,273
Well, let's see, at 5:15,

198
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,907
Peter's white Chevy Blazer
parked outside.

199
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,548
5:17, I hear a thump —

200
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:28,309
Miss Margaret sneaking past my door.
I found this.

201
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:33,346
5:20, a plaintive wail from
the neighbor's schnauzer.

202
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:37,214
Oh, here's some
late-breaking evidence.

203
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:41,708
A candy striper uniform on my ham.

204
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,802
Thank you, F. Lee Butler.

205
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:48,996
Mr. Sheffield still sick?
/ Yes. Lucky you.

206
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:53,251
Oh, Niles, I would never wish the man ill
just so that I could sneak out of the —

207
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:56,981
Niles.
/ Oh, man, what's he doing up?

208
00:14:57,145 --> 00:15:00,060
Niles, Miss Babcock and I — oh ...

209
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,916
Miss Babcock — um ...

210
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:06,446
Miss Babcock — oh ...

211
00:15:06,897 --> 00:15:10,013
Yes, I know the feeling, sir.

212
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:18,023
He's trying to say we have
to go out to a meeting.

213
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:22,164
Oh, very good, sir.
So then Miss Babcook — forgive me ...

214
00:15:24,252 --> 00:15:29,047
Babcock — won't be poisoning
you this evening?

215
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,929
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.
You know what I think, Niles?

216
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:36,082
I think you're jealous. You know why
he doesn't come home for dinner?

217
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:42,228
You don't keep it interesting.
For 20 years, it's the same old recipes.

218
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:46,730
Let's face it, Niles,
you let yourself go.

219
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,046
He's bored.

220
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:55,835
Oh, don't listen to her.

221
00:15:55,835 --> 00:16:01,415
I bet when he's eating her coq au vin,
he's fantasizing about yours.

222
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:07,226
Well, I'm not worried. Do you think
this is the first time he's strayed?

223
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:11,712
But he's always home for breakfast.

224
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:18,033
Maxwell!

225
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,489
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, I'm —
I'm really concerned about you.

226
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:26,843
You don't look well at all.
/ Really? Maybe I should stay home.

227
00:16:26,843 --> 00:16:29,781
What am I, a doctor? Go. Go.

228
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,830
Okay. I need a candy striper
to stay an extra hour.

229
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,792
You. You don't look like
you have a curfew.

230
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,451
Do you think that's
appropriate for work?

231
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,718
Works for him.

232
00:17:09,341 --> 00:17:11,784
Take these to the
linen supply room.

233
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,982
Hello?

234
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:32,433
Ma, how did you find me here?

235
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:36,174
Well, what's the emergency?

236
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:42,462
Ma, Mike Douglas isn't on Channel 4
because they canceled him 22 years ago.

237
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:46,429
Would you spring for a new TV Guide.

238
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:50,109
Don't worry. It's just his appendix.

239
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:54,555
It's a very routine operation.
You're going to be fine, Mr. Sheffield.

240
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:59,868
Now, you just relax.
I promise no more pain until you get my bill.

241
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,620
Okay. Pleasant dreams.

242
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:07,289
He'll be back in the room
in a couple of hours.

243
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,716
Are you the wife?

244
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:10,749
Yes.

245
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:29,272
Nurse, help me prep for surgery.

246
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:34,306
Okay. You look good.

247
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:36,694
You're a doctor. You can do it.

248
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:40,424
Not me. The patient.

249
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,403
Miss Fine ...

250
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:48,778
Oh, yeah, you're fine.
I'm fine. We're all fine.

251
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,655
Shave him.

252
00:18:57,914 --> 00:18:59,277
All right ...

253
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,890
You're the doctor.

254
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,462
What are you doing?

255
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,856
Well, I have no idea.

256
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:30,425
I mean, the man has
a slight five o'clock shadow,

257
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:34,358
but it's not like he's
going to a bar mitzvah.

258
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:37,322
Shave him for surgery.

259
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:41,230
Well, where do you want me
to shave him — oh!

260
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:47,571
You know, I'll be back in a minute.
I have a girl that does a bikini wax.

261
00:19:48,473 --> 00:19:49,941
Now!

262
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,277
Oh, all right.

263
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,478
Bucking for a raise?

264
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:58,223
Oh, Fran, the hospital was
awesome today. / Really?

265
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:03,865
There was this one guy with his eyeball
just hanging by a bloody vein.

266
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:08,647
Miss Fine
/ Oh, hi, Mr. Sheffield.

267
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,885
Nice to see you up and around.
/ Thank you.

268
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:15,595
Oh, Dad, your color's looking
really good. I'll just take your pulse.

269
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:17,051
Oh, my God! / What?

270
00:21:17,051 --> 00:21:19,867
Peter's picking me up
in ten minutes.

271
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:25,857
Well, even Dr. Quinn's got a mountain man.

272
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:32,405
You know, Miss Fine, I had the oddest dream
when I was going under the anesthetic.

273
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:36,795
Oh, really?

274
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:40,044
Yes. I was married to C.C.

275
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:43,139
And you — you — you were my nurse.

276
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:46,555
Yeah, that's the drugs.

277
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:49,396
Um, you know, when my mother
had her hysterectomy,

278
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:54,931
she was convinced that
the operation was on "60 Minutes."

279
00:21:55,544 --> 00:22:01,667
Yeah. Why Mike Wallace would devote a whole
segment to her uterus, she never questioned.

280
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:05,335
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
Drugs can play strange tricks on the mind.

281
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:07,226
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
/ Well, good night, Miss Fine.

282
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,358
Good night, Mr. Sheffield.

283
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:17,306
Miss Fine!

284
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:31,415
Brighten, how long
have you been there?

285
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:34,808
Since "Does this unhook in the front?"

286
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:39,632
Brighten, you liar.
/ You love torturing your sister, huh?

287
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:43,627
Yeah. Well, it's something to do
until I get my license. / Yeah, yeah.

288
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:48,503
He has been out of control ever
since we scrambled the Playboy channel.
