1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,758
Oh, Niles, this is an excellent
issue of "Vanity Fair."

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:07,511
- Oh, really? What's in it?
- Obsession —---

3
00:00:09,153 --> 00:00:11,648
oh, Safari ...

4
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:16,758
Mel Gibson ...

5
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:21,466
- He has a cologne?
- No.

6
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:26,049
So now which one's Mr. Sheffield
and which one's Miss Fine?

7
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:29,245
- She named her hamster after me.
- Oh ...

8
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:33,791
- How can you tell them apart?
- Fran's the fat one.

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:37,675
She's not fat.
She just has big hair.

10
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,704
Oh, no, Mr. Sheffield is
fighting with Miss Fine.

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,151
- He's not fighting with her.
He's having — - Mr. Sheffield,

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,099
get off of Miss Fine.
Miss Fine has a headache.

13
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:52,168
Oh, look, Mr. Sheffield
has already fallen asleep.

14
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:55,254
Okay, kids, go bring Miss Fine
upstairs and give her a chew stick.

15
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:57,926
She's not satisfied.

16
00:00:57,926 --> 00:01:01,375
Miss Fine, this month's "Soap Opera
Hair Magazine" has arrived.

17
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,221
- The bigger is better issue?
- Uh-huh. With a free sample.

18
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:08,985
Oh, this is like Hanukkah in July.

19
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:12,003
Fran, I can't believe
you're doing that?

20
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:15,925
Why, honey? Did you think that
I got this fullness naturally?

21
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:18,737
Oh, no. This is just an outer shell.

22
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:21,955
Inside I've got gel,
mousse, volumizer.

23
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:25,890
There's a whole infrastructure
going on in there.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,748
The only difference between me
and the kingdom is AstroTurf.

25
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:32,873
Fran, don't you care
about ecology?

26
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:36,899
There are chemicals in here that are
unsafe. Some of that stuff is toxic.

27
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:42,238
Honey, you want to clean up toxic waste,
start with Brighton's bathroom.

28
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:48,056
- Fran, I'm serious. Give me that.
- Oh, no, no, I didn't do the tendrils yet.

29
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:51,375
Oh, boy, I'm getting
a weird flashback here

30
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:57,825
- only you're me and I'm my mother.
- What are you talking about?

31
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:01,596
I was young too once,
out to save the world.

32
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:07,269
- So you were like an activist in the "60s?
- '70s, late.

33
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:10,947
- Nuclear power, animal rights, cyclamates.
- Cyclamates?

34
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:15,721
Oh, yeah, it was a big controversy.
Lemon Tang was never the same.

35
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:12,124
Mr. Sheffield, if you were my cousin Marsha
and you saw me in this dress, what would you do?

36
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:15,380
I'd, ah, tell you
you looked fabulous

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,711
and then trash you the moment
you left the room.

38
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,121
And?

39
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:25,362
- And, um, eat an entire Sara Lee pound cake?
- There you go.

40
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:29,119
For a minute there I thought
I was going to have to change.

41
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,485
Isn't it a little sedate
for you, Nanny Fine?

42
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:36,250
You don't look like you're trying to get
a sailor to buy you a champagen cocktail.

43
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,418
Where you headed? A funeral?

44
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:46,883
As a matter of fact, I am.
My great Aunt Mema Fager. She was 104.

45
00:03:46,883 --> 00:03:51,488
- Oh ... well, how'd she die?
- Childbirth.

46
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,300
Fran, tell dad he's
being totally unfair.

47
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,193
Mr. Sheffield,
you're being totally unfair.

48
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:02,265
What is it I'm trying
to get him to do again?

49
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:05,977
Mark and I want to go to an all-night,
save-the-earth poetry reading.

50
00:04:05,977 --> 00:04:11,983
Oh, right, what's the big deal? Maggie and Mark
want to go to an all-night save-the-earth — all night?

51
00:04:12,393 --> 00:04:17,401
- Oh, honey, kiss it off. - Fran, they're
having a candlelight vigil for animal rights.

52
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:22,137
Oh, that reminds me, I gotta
pick up the pastrami platter.

53
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:27,098
You know if it sits too long,
it gets that rainbow batina thing happening.

54
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:31,670
I can't believe you. Is this
what happens when you turn when 21?

55
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,868
21 ...

56
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:37,544
Don't mock the child, Niles.

57
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:41,935
Look, Maggie, why don't you and your friends
take it in turns to save the planet? Hum?

58
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:46,634
You could take the day shift and then someone
whose parents are out of town could take the night.

59
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:49,551
Oh, fine. I'll go stand
in the hole in the ozone layer.

60
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:52,583
Be sure to wear sun block.

61
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:55,690
Well, Miss Fine, it's refreshing
to have you on my side for a change.

62
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:02,466
Oh, that. I read somewhere that the primary-care
giver should always agree with the guy that writes the checks.

63
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:04,076
Uh-huh. Thank you for your support.

64
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:08,528
But for your information, I am too young
to be on the pig side of a generation gap.

65
00:05:08,528 --> 00:05:13,464
Huff and puff as much as you like, Miss Fine.
This little piggy is not letting her go.

66
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:16,392
That doesn't mean I'm not thrilled
Margaret has a social conscience.

67
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,772
I just wish there were
more people like her.

68
00:05:18,772 --> 00:05:23,804
Oh, aren't the elephant tusks exquisite.

69
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:29,522
They came from that cute
little poacher in Kenya.

70
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:33,468
And here I thought you'd had
your wisdom teeth pulled.

71
00:05:34,664 --> 00:05:37,001
So when you're watching "Gorillas
in the Mist," you're thinking

72
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,557
in a fajita, I bet they're not so bad.

73
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:49,789
It was a gorgeous funeral.

74
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:56,061
Ah, Mema Fager didn't look so hot.
May she rest in piece.

75
00:05:56,271 --> 00:06:00,834
She could never pull it together
from a special occasion.

76
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:05,635
You know, when my time comes,
I don't want no open casket.

77
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:09,872
I don't trust no one to
put on my makeup but me.

78
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:21,315
- How's the corned beef?
- Fatty, Daddy. No good.

79
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:24,850
What do you do when you like something?
Eat the Corning Ware?

80
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,286
- So when are you due?
- Grandma, I'm not pregnant.

81
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:32,218
So stop eating.

82
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:38,673
Morty, turn the set down.
We're mourning in here.

83
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:41,477
Meanwhile, explain to me
green carnations on a casket.

84
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:43,796
St. Patty didn't drop dead.

85
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:48,179
Why didn't their side spend
a little on flowers like we did.

86
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,769
Syl, their side never
did as well as us.

87
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,013
What well? My daughter's a maid.

88
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,839
Nanny, Ma.

89
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:04,779
- Meanwhile, I wonder who got the coat.
- What coat?

90
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,574
Mema's mink. She slept with it more
than she slept with Oscar.

91
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,319
Mema's husband's name was Louie.

92
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,653
Yeah. So where are
you not following me?

93
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,662
Oh, well, I guess it wasn't the mortician
that put that smile on her face.

94
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:27,754
Maybe we should see what's
in the envelope uncle Dave gave us.

95
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:30,322
I think it's a copy of the will.

96
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:33,740
You know, I always offered
to drive her to her checkups,

97
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,093
even after the bladder went.

98
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,172
Save it, Marsha. It's already written.

99
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:43,726
She's not coming back with an erasure.

100
00:07:43,726 --> 00:07:47,820
- Aunt Frita got Mema's diamond wedding ring.
- Ahhhhhh ...

101
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,719
I wanted that.

102
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:54,930
- Cousin Judy got the blender.
- Ahhhhhh ...

103
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,815
I could have used that.

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,059
- Uncle Morey got the pasta machine.
- Ahhhhhh ...

105
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:05,036
That they could have.

106
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:08,521
Who cares about their side.
Let's get to our side.

107
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,276
Their side, our side.
Who's keeping score?

108
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:16,966
- Meanwhile, it's three zip.
- Oh, please, Ma, calm down.

109
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:21,558
You're svitzing already.
Soon you're going to slide off the couch.

110
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:24,416
This is such a trying time for me.

111
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:29,325
- Life won't be the same without my beloved Mema.
- Shut up, Marsha.

112
00:08:29,325 --> 00:08:35,233
"And the coat goes to Fran Fine."
Come on down.

113
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:39,307
I won the coat? I won. I won.

114
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,710
May she rest in peace.

115
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,938
She gave Fran the coat?

116
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:50,358
Who schlepped her to the beauty parlor
every week to get her three hairs set?

117
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:53,079
Who smeared her with BenGay
after shuffle board,

118
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:57,171
and after she got the hammer toe
fixed, who lugged her around?

119
00:08:57,171 --> 00:09:00,337
My husband, that's who.

120
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,197
Well, you can keep the coat
because I don't want it.

121
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:06,459
What are you nuts? Why?

122
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:10,324
Ma, I only wear fake fur.
And do you know why?

123
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:15,377
Yes. Because no one ever died
and left you a real one before.

124
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:18,883
No. I have a very impressionable
teenager at home that needs to know

125
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:23,269
that I stick by my beliefs,
and I believe in animal rights.

126
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:30,142
Fran, a mink is not an animal.
It's a rodent.

127
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:36,140
If it was up in the attic, you would
be the first one to call Terminex.

128
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:41,242
Ma, knock it off. I'm not putting
a dead animal anywhere near me.

129
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:44,352
Pass the tongue.

130
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,661
- Fran, you're keeping the coat.
- No, I'm not.

131
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,798
And do we have to discuss this
in front of everyone?

132
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:54,435
- No, we'll discuss it in there.
- Fine.

133
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:57,487
Excuse us.

134
00:09:57,753 --> 00:10:01,270
They don't want to talk in front of us.

135
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,567
How could you turn your back on everything
that I raised you to believe in?

136
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,501
This is mink.

137
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:12,362
Ma, if you love the mink so much,
why don't you keep it?

138
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,919
I'm too busty.

139
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:19,087
Didn't stop you from wearing
a tube top to Temple.

140
00:10:22,482 --> 00:10:25,631
It's reform.

141
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:28,789
Ma, forget it.
I'm not taking the coat.

142
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:32,116
You know, you're killing
me with this.

143
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:36,376
If I die tonight,
you'll never forgive yourself.

144
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:40,740
Ma, I'm a grown woman. You can't use
guilt on me anymore to get what you want.

145
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,419
- Oh!
- What's the matter, Ma?

146
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:49,517
Nothing. I just hope I'm not getting
that weird flesh-eating disease.

147
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,198
We couldn't hear.

148
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:06,994
- Niles ...
- Huh?

149
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:11,026
- Did my mother call?
- Well, I'm not sure. There was one call —

150
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:17,526
a sob, a sigh, and
a long plaintive oy ...

151
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:25,099
Well, either that's her or AT & T is really
depressed that we switched to Sprint.

152
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:29,292
I can't believe she would stoop
to crank guilt calls.

153
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:35,261
- How low can she go?
- Hey, you're talking about a woman that could grow a tumor on command.

154
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:40,118
- Ha, ha, ha. Excuse me.
- Well, it's not going to work.

155
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:43,127
I'm a grown woman.
I'm entitled to my own opinions,

156
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:47,792
and no silent treatment is going to
make me compromise my ideals.

157
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:52,359
- That coat is staying in Queens.
- Thank you.

158
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:57,622
Oh, can you believe her. Didn't she hear
a word I said? I don't want this disgusting

159
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:04,077
soft, lush, plush — oh, Niles,
did you see the satin lining?

160
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:07,627
- Boy, they don't make them like that anymore.
- Well, it does become you, Miss Fine.

161
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:13,772
Oh, no, Niles, it's absolutely
repulsive. I can't stand it.

162
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:17,611
Up or down. Oh, take it off me.
Take it off.

163
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:22,483
Oh, look, at the initials,
M.F., Mema Fager —

164
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:26,358
Miss Fine, like it was meant to be.

165
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:30,030
Well, you could always send
it to Morgan Freeman.

166
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:37,095
Oh, Mema. It smells just like her,
Chalimar and stuffed cabbage?

167
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:41,199
I remember when I was a little girl in the winter.
She would bundle me up in her coat with her,

168
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:47,134
her bosoms right on top of my head.
My ears never got cold.

169
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:54,665
I looked like Princess Laya until
Mema got older. Then I looked like Goofy.

170
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:59,105
Funny, as a lad, I don't ever recall
wearing bosoms as a hat.

171
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:03,930
- Although, once at a butlers' convention —
- Don't take me there, Niles.

172
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:08,620
- Oh, my God. Fran, what is that dead animal?
- Where? Where?

173
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,420
- On your back.
- Oh, this. Oh, I inherited this, but I refused to accept it.

174
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,322
Then why are you wearing it?

175
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:20,041
Ah, I'm just indulging Niles.
He wanted to see me in it.

176
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,694
All right, already, are you happy?
Can I take it off? Geez.

177
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:29,878
- Niles, I'm surprised at you.
- Oh, forgive me, Miss Margaret.
I'm such a beast

178
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:38,408
Good morning, everyone ... But Dad.

179
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,002
Niles, thank you so much for buying glass
bottles instead of plastic ones at the market.

180
00:13:44,002 --> 00:13:48,754
My pleasure, Miss Margaret. I've always
wanted to know what a hernia felt like.

181
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,844
- Aren't you joining us, Maggie?
- Oh, no.

182
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:57,556
While you leisurely sit here and eat, hundreds
of acres of rain forest are being destroyed.

183
00:13:57,556 --> 00:14:00,290
So you're taking your croissant
back to the biosphere.

184
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,345
Sit down, Margaret.

185
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:06,197
- Hello, hello.
- Oh, Cee Cee, care to join us?

186
00:14:06,197 --> 00:14:10,106
- Well, is there enough?
- No. / Niles ...

187
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:15,356
Well, it's just that you know how
I feel about her eating inside.

188
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:20,515
- What was that?
- I asked what she would like on the side.

189
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:24,188
Bacon, sausage, Mighty Dog?

190
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:27,571
Whoa!

191
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:37,364
Oh, it's so nice sitting here with
all of you. I feel like part of the family.

192
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:40,260
Good morning, Stacy.

193
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:43,512
- Gracie.
- Thank you ...

194
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:46,436
Brighton.

195
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:52,030
- So, kids, what's new?
- Miss Fine's having a baby.

196
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,236
- What?
- Who's the father?

197
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:57,891
Why, Mr. Sheffield of course.

198
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:04,393
Miss Fine, what on earth is all
this about you being pregnant?

199
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:07,599
Pregnant? Me?
Oh, that's impossible.

200
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,281
Well, it's not impossible.

201
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:14,264
Oh, yeah, it's impossible.

202
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:19,807
- Miss Fine and Mr. Sheffield are hamsters.
- Oh, I knew I left something out.

203
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,778
Oh, please, no animals in the dining room.

204
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:28,815
- I will be in the office.
- Oh, very good, sir. Usually, I have to tug at her leash.

205
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:33,315
- Niles, has my mother called yet?
- No, I'm afraid not.

206
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:39,224
- Oh, Miss Fine, why don't you just take
the blasted coat and have done with it. - No ...

207
00:15:39,224 --> 00:15:42,286
Why can't Fran have an opinion
different than her mother's.

208
00:15:42,286 --> 00:15:45,557
Children should have the right to make
their own decisions and live their own lives.

209
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:47,502
You can have any opinion you like, Maggie,

210
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:53,063
just don't have it in the park
after dark with Mark. Oh, there's your poetry.

211
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:56,115
- Now you don't have to go.
- Oh ...

212
00:15:56,371 --> 00:16:00,202
Oh, come on, Miss Fine, how'd you
make up with your mother in the past?

213
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:01,956
Well, when I was a little girl,

214
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:06,725
I would put a napkin on my head
and sing "Sunrise, Sunset."

215
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:13,021
At eight it's adorable. At 30,
they're giving you 3,000 units of Thorazine.

216
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:14,820
Well, if there's anything I can do.

217
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,811
Well, now that you mention it,
couldn't you talk to her, please.

218
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,084
I man you're so handsome, diplomatic.

219
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:25,746
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Well, my mother responds to good looks.

220
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:30,945
She always said you reminded her of
Dave from Alvin and the Chipmunks.

221
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:34,963
- The cartoon?
- Yeah. She had a thing for George Jetson too,

222
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:38,331
but he's a little more goyish.

223
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:46,612
Oh, Niles, isn't Mr. Sheffield a doll for going to
all the trouble of inviting my mother here for dinner?

224
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:50,496
Yes. He's really knocked himself out.

225
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:54,365
- Did you stock the bar?
- Yes, Miss Fine, we have Chevitz, Pins, Schnider

226
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:57,107
— what does Sylvia like to drink?
- Diet Slice.

227
00:16:57,107 --> 00:17:02,509
- Oh, will Fresca do?
- No, it doesn't have to the zest of lime in it.

228
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:07,401
- Fine, now I'm going to have to go out ... Hi.
- Oh, Miss Fine.

229
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,419
Oh, this should be
an interesting dinner, sir.

230
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,751
Miss Fine and her mother not speaking,
Miss Margaret not speaking to you.

231
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:18,600
- That will leave the bulk of the conversation
to you and Sylvia. - Oh, good God.

232
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,063
Well, perhaps you can swap stories.
You can tell her how you started in the theater,

233
00:17:22,063 --> 00:17:26,227
and she can tell you how
she removes unwanted hair.

234
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:28,058
For heaven sakes, we've got to
get someone else for dinner.

235
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:30,873
Well, it is Saturday night, sir,
and most people do have a life.

236
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:34,182
- Well, I'm off.
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.

237
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,312
Cee Cee, by any chance are
you free tonight?

238
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:41,218
No. I have to pick up
my grandfather from the airport.

239
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:46,899
Old thing's in wheelchair with
a respirator — why?

240
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,566
- Well, I was just wondering if you'd care
to join me for dinner? - Done. Love too.

241
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:53,392
- What about, what about your grandfather?
- Oh, he'll get a sky cap.

242
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:56,885
He's loaded. He'll put a 20
in his mouth and wave it.

243
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:59,860
- No, no. I just can't do this.
- Oh, no, no, no, Maxwell.
It's not a problem.

244
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,410
The old guy's in a wheelchair.
It's downhill from La Guardia.

245
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,622
No, you see, it won't be just us.
I'm afraid Miss Fine and her mother will be there.

246
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:10,524
Oh, I hate that woman.

247
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,438
- Which one?
- Pick.

248
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:18,980
Really? Sylvia's always saying what a beautiful,
charming, sophisticated woman of the world you are.

249
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,732
Really? Those were her exact words?

250
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:26,244
Oh, that reminds me. I have to get
the name of your manicurist.

251
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:29,948
Sylvia's always going on about
how beautifully young your hands look.

252
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:32,498
I've always adored Syl.

253
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:35,424
- But if you have a more pressing engagement,
then of course — - Forget about gramps.

254
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:38,674
I'll call the airline. They'll stick
him where they put the skis.

255
00:18:38,674 --> 00:18:45,063
Niles, another place sitting on the table
and make it right next to my pal Syl.

256
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:48,906
Get the name of your manicurist indeed.

257
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:52,440
- I learned from the master.
- Yeah, well ...

258
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,430
Aren't my hamsters cute? We named
the babies Maggie, Brighton, and Grace.

259
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,797
There was a Cee Cee,
but Miss Fine ate her.

260
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:06,491
Isn't that adorable.

261
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:09,923
The kid collects vermin.

262
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:14,228
Syl ... Is that you?

263
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:17,711
Yeah. I was invited.

264
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:21,524
Shame on you girl friend.

265
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,643
Why haven't we done lunch?

266
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:30,576
Because when you saw me eat a chicken,
you had to take an Advil.

267
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:34,010
Oh, hi, Ma. What a nice surprise.

268
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,182
Gee, I didn't know
Mr. Sheffield invited you for dinner.

269
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:42,060
- You want a diet Slice?
- No, thanks. It gases me up.

270
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,373
Come on, sisealla.

271
00:19:46,273 --> 00:19:51,680
- Oh, this ring is stunning.
- My aunt gave it to me.

272
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,014
Oh, it's a family heirloom.

273
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:59,332
How nice of you to not throw it
back in your aunt's face.

274
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:03,810
- Ma, would you cut me some slack?
- Why won't you wear a stinking coat.

275
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:09,562
- You watch your tone of voice, young lady.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

276
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:12,217
Not you, Ma.
He's talking to Maggie.

277
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:15,433
Maggie does nothing.
She's a good daughter.

278
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:18,762
And what am I? Patty Davis?

279
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:23,329
This is just like when you refused
the mother-daughter kaftans that I bought us.

280
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:26,008
Six years old and a turban?

281
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,795
That's it. I wash my hands of you.

282
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,571
- Oh, Mr. Sheffield.
- Oh, oh, she's getting away. Niles, the napkin.
- No. Oh, no.

283
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:35,994
- Yes, Miss Fine, yes, yes.
- Oh, no, no, no.

284
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:41,946
"Is this the little girl I carried?"

285
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:48,227
- Fran, that's not fair.
- "Is this the little boy at play?"

286
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:54,898
- Bomb, boom, bomb.
- "I don't remember growing older."

287
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:59,920
"When did they?"

288
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:04,854
- Oh, Fran, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too, Mom.

289
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:08,125
Oh, Syl ...

290
00:21:08,394 --> 00:21:11,106
Oh, please, it's over.

291
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:13,802
Miss Babcock TWA is on the phone.

292
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:18,622
- It seems there's an unclaimed elderly
gentleman on Carrousel 5. - Oh ...

293
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,893
Oh, Ma, I don't want to fight anymore.

294
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:27,679
Me neither. It's just such
an honor that Mema chose you.

295
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,156
She came to this country
with nothing.

296
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:32,696
She worked, she sacrificed.

297
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:37,112
This coat symbolizes
the struggles of our family.

298
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:41,645
Ma, she won it
on the "Price is Right."

299
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:45,420
Fran, you should keep the coat.

300
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,952
After all, you're the one who always
says family comes first.

301
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:52,372
Oh, all right. I'll keep the coat.

302
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:55,494
Oh, I never thought
I'd hear you say those words.

303
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:58,988
But just in case,
I got it right here.

304
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:01,220
Oh, but I can't wear it.

305
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,087
All right, maybe just around
my Cousin Marsha

306
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:09,877
because it will kill her, and then
at least the minks won't have died in vain.

307
00:22:10,215 --> 00:22:14,365
And, Dad, as important as
this poetry meeting is to me,

308
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:20,019
if you really don't want me to go,
then I'll respect your decision.

309
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:24,124
- I really don't want you to go.
- Why not?

310
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:31,226
That is the most beautiful coat
I have ever seen.

311
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,670
I'll give you $10,000 for it right now.

312
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:40,117
- Oh, no, I'm sorry. This coat —
