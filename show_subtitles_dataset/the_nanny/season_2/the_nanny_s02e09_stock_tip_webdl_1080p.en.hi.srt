1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,359
Good afternoon.
/ Hi, Mr. Sheffield.

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,012
Maxwell, if you don't jump on this,
someone else will. / Oh, she's bluffing, sir.

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,823
I am talking about using
our company profits

4
00:00:16,823 --> 00:00:20,397
to buy a dreamy little vacation
house on Martha's Vineyard.

5
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:23,414
I can just see myself lying
on the beach for days ...

6
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:28,125
Oh, I'm sure someone would tow you out
to sea if your blow hole got clogged.

7
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,617
Cee Cee, I am not about to
make such a large investment

8
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:34,118
without exploring
all the options first.

9
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:39,441
Oh, I'm with you. My father once invested
in one of those big tall men shops.

10
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:41,778
Oh, well, now those
are very successful.

11
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:45,263
Not the one in Tokyo.

12
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:47,152
Fran, I'm ready to pick up guys.

13
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:50,261
Groceries, honey, groceries.

14
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:53,719
Kids. I don't know where
they pick these things up from.

15
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,684
Miss Fine, you wouldn't seriously
consider dating some total stranger

16
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,826
you picked up in a grocery
store, would you?

17
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,142
Well, it's a fancy
Park Avenue market.

18
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:05,105
I mean it's not as if I'm going
to a mini-mart at a gas station.

19
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,506
Although Val did meet
a guy there once,

20
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:11,821
but he only used her
as a human shield.

21
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:15,923
Okay. Anybody need anything?

22
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:17,993
No, thanks, I do
my shopping late at night.

23
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:22,656
Makes sense. If a man's hungry enough,
any old thing looks good.

24
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:16,195
Oh, honey, honey, honey,
go easy on the candy.

25
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:18,012
Your teeth are going
to fall out.

26
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,187
Fran, baby teeth are
supposed to fall out.

27
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:22,587
God made them that way
so that kids could eat

28
00:02:22,587 --> 00:02:24,667
all the sugar they want
and be happy.

29
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:31,120
Nice try. Meanwhile, if God waas so benevolent,
when you turned 30, your hips would fall off.

30
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:35,507
Everything you need to know about a man,
you can find right in his cart.

31
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:39,174
If there's a box of Midol,
keep moving.

32
00:02:39,174 --> 00:02:44,823
Corn pads means he lives with his mother,
learned that the hard way.

33
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:49,939
And if you see two guys with sweaters tied
around their necks buying pesto,

34
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:53,577
save yourself the pain.

35
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:55,452
What about him?

36
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:59,897
Um, let's see, cabbage,
chili, refried beans,

37
00:02:59,897 --> 00:03:05,589
oh, one dinner with him and you'd spend
the rest of the night blaming the dog.

38
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:14,605
Oh, excuse me.

39
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:19,063
This is, this is probably
a stupid question

40
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:23,049
because obviously you've never
been on a diet in your life.

41
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,543
Oh, me, hardly.

42
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:36,933
Oh, they're delish, you know,
you smear them with some butter

43
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,429
and then you fry them lightly
on both sides

44
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:43,852
and then a squirt of whipped cream
puts it right over the top.

45
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:47,956
Personally, I like whipped
cream on everything.

46
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:51,945
Oh, ha.

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,494
Well, I'd be happy to give you
a recipe for your wife.

48
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:59,223
I'm not married.

49
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:03,959
Fran, can we get these sugar...
/ Knock yourself out, honey.

50
00:04:06,691 --> 00:04:08,474
That's a cute daughter
you have there.

51
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:12,809
Oh, I'm not her mother.
I'm Fran, her single nanny.

52
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:14,216
Hi. / Hi.

53
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:15,773
Glen. / Hi, Glen.

54
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:21,336
Well, let's see. I see bacon,
pork rinds, Virginia ham.

55
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:25,644
Well, I know one thing,
you're not a rabbi.

56
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:28,121
My cover is blown ...

57
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,489
You've got a great smile.

58
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:34,312
Fran, what about these...
/ Yeah, go for it, babe.

59
00:04:35,031 --> 00:04:39,874
So we ruled out rabbi, and
I can tell you're not a lawyer

60
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:41,689
Why can't I pass as a lawyer?

61
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:46,121
Well, not in New York,
I mean, maybe L.A.

62
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:51,485
I work an Wall Street.
/ Oh, a stockbroker.

63
00:04:51,485 --> 00:04:55,432
So what's the matter? Can't stay
away from the market?

64
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,213
Fran, this one comes with a prize.
I got lucky.

65
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,509
You and me both.

66
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:12,661
Um, Niles, you have really
outdone yourself this time.

67
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:16,710
Thank you, sir.
Another pop tart?

68
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:22,183
No, but I could go for some more of
those leprechaun things.

69
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:26,398
They are magically delicious.

70
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,236
Um, look at this great picture
of Marylou Retin.

71
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:33,674
I think it's actual size.

72
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,462
So, Miss Fine, where are you
off to on your day off?

73
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,738
I'm going to the Hamptons
for a lobster lunch

74
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:46,603
with the man that I met at the grocery
— told you so — store.

75
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,685
And how exactly did
he win your heart?

76
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:52,906
That immortal line,
"paper or plastic"?

77
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:56,733
Oh, no, he's no box boy,
much higher.

78
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:59,941
Does he use a hose?

79
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,699
That depends on how hot we get.

80
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:10,809
Hi, Daddy; bye, Daddy.

81
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:14,255
Well, I guess the breakfast
just kicked in.

82
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:21,012
Oh, man, this is really scary.
I'm dressed just like Snap.

83
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:24,479
Val once dated a guy that
looked like Crackle.

84
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,464
Unfortunately, he popped too quick ...

85
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:37,545
Oh, that must be Glen, my stockbroker
from the grocery store.

86
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:41,317
Niles, my butler from England,
will answer it.

87
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:44,041
How do you like this outfit?

88
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,145
That's nice. You look very festive.

89
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:50,332
Festive? Carmen Miranda is festive.

90
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:54,036
Ms. Fine, you forgot your hat.

91
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:59,178
I'd like you to meet Glen Mitchell
the stock... / the stockbroker.

92
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:01,810
This is my boss, Maxwell Sheffield.
/ How do you do?

93
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,376
The Broadway producer.

94
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:09,056
This is an honor. I, I, I saw your
last play six times. / Really?

95
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:12,432
Even the family only had
to sit through it twice...

96
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,994
And the second time was even better.

97
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:21,032
I think you had to see it more than once
to fully comprehend the metaphor.

98
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:25,141
What metaphor?
/ Adam and Eve, original sin.

99
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:31,154
I mean, that's why she never
ate the ribs; right?

100
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:36,047
God, that's clever.
I missed that.

101
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:38,300
I, I thought it was brilliant.

102
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,067
Yeah, me too. Meanwhile, there's a six-pound
lobster getting his affairs in order. Bye.

103
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,474
Is that a Robert Graham?

104
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:49,445
Yes, yes, it is. He's one of
my favorite sculptors. / Mine too?

105
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:54,832
I love him. Didn't he design that beer mug
where you drink out of the nipple?

106
00:07:55,524 --> 00:08:00,147
You know, I have the companion piece of that
up in the bedroom. Would you like to see it?

107
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,704
I'll bet it's worth twice
what you paid for it.

108
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:05,428
If it is, I'll sell it to you.

109
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,438
Well, it's so nice that the three
of us are getting closer.

110
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:13,821
My cousin Merrill's husband
had a friend named Sam.

111
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:17,086
The three of them did
everything together,

112
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:19,686
except Merrill wasn't
much of a dancer

113
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:24,457
so sometimes the two guys would
go out together — hey.

114
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:33,336
Cee Cee, we are not investing
in a summer home.

115
00:08:33,336 --> 00:08:35,721
Now Glen mentioned
a fabulous stock.

116
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,316
That's where we should put our
company's profits.

117
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:42,852
But, Maxwell, look at this
Martha's Vineyard house.

118
00:08:42,852 --> 00:08:45,977
There's even a servants'
shack behind the dune.

119
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:50,552
We can keep Niles there when
he's not waiting on us.

120
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:53,179
Lemon cake? / Please ...

121
00:08:57,373 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, Brighten is really upset
about this whole Rice Krispie elf resemblance thing

122
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,801
so I'm taking him downtown shopping.
He wants a whole new look.

123
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:09,278
Oh, it's just a stage, Miss Fine.

124
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,828
When I was his age, I was
a bit of a rebel myself.

125
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:16,820
Oh, what'd you wear?
Brown socks and black shoes?

126
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,889
Sometimes.

127
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:22,030
Once I wore my dickie backwards

128
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,764
and no one knew.
/ Watch out.

129
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,864
Hello. Oh, hello, Glen. / Oh, boy, is
he an eager beaver. Hand it over.

130
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,211
Thank you for getting back to me.

131
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,657
I just wanted to call and say how much
I enjoyed our squash game.

132
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:44,852
And my partner and I are very
intrigued by that stock tip.

133
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:47,694
My partner and I are very intrigued
by that stock tip.

134
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:51,859
Listen, I'll come by the club later
on and bring you a check. Uh-huh.

135
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,306
Yes, Fran's right here.

136
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,143
Glen says hello. Oh, and by the way,
thank you for introducing us.

137
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:05,300
Oh, and my pleasure, and where are you
registered? Do you need a nice punch bowl?

138
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,598
Come on, Gloomy, keep up.

139
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,850
Viper and the hounds.

140
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:18,662
Oh, honey, I think you should hike up
your pants a little bit.

141
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:23,386
No, Fran, this is cool.
/ No, honey, this is the Maytag repairman.

142
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:27,891
How about a nice hot dog?
I'm thinking sour crout, red onions —

143
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:29,366
Oh, and a little mayonaise.

144
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:32,399
Okay, you can have your own.

145
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,810
No, honey, I'm telling you,
this is Gomer;

146
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,134
this is Goober. This is cool.

147
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:45,434
Can I help you — boy.

148
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:48,480
Oh, my God.

149
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,696
You're a hot dog vendor?

150
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,362
That's not even Kosher.

151
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:08,034
Oh, Niles, I am responsible for Mr. Sheffield
investing his money with a hot dog vendor.

152
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:12,010
I'll be in my room. Weeeee!

153
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:18,391
Not to mention getting his kid
hooked own riboflavin.

154
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:22,486
Oh, this is the worst trouble
I have ever been in.

155
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:27,355
Ever since the time I corn wrote
my father's toupe.

156
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:31,576
Thank God he knew all the lyrics
to "Sunshine of My Life."

157
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,327
Well, you could always get Mr. Sheffield's
business manager to sell the stocks.

158
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:39,069
Oh, Niles, you're a genius.
Who's his business manager?

159
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:43,410
No, no, I don't think you know
who you're talking to.

160
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,517
I've got lawyers; I've got money,
and I know where you live.

161
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:51,849
You will rue the day you
crossed CeeCee Babcock.

162
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:54,507
Bye, Mommy. Kiss kiss.

163
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:02,358
Oh, Niles, will you ask her for me?

164
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:05,315
Oh, she detests me more than you.
/ No way.

165
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:07,427
Way.

166
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:12,116
Maggie, who does Miss Babcock
hates more? Me or him?

167
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:15,403
Oh, God, this is hard.

168
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:18,912
She hates both your guts.
/ Yeah, but I make her nauseous.

169
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:21,709
I make her drink.

170
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:25,414
Look, I don't want to hurt
anyone's feelings here,

171
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:28,610
but I'd have to say
she hates Niles more.

172
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,288
Yes, still No. 1.

173
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,613
Knock, knock.

174
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:39,170
Miss Babcock,

175
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:43,866
look, I made you some
cucumber sandwiches.

176
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,766
And I cut all the crust off
on the bread.

177
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,709
And look, there's even a little
cherry tomato flower.

178
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,838
I'm dying, aren't I?

179
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:04,418
No, no, of course not.

180
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:07,296
It's just that, well, we spend
so much time together,

181
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,961
I thought that we should be friends.

182
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:15,141
You want something, don't you?
Nanny Fine wants something.

183
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:18,145
Oh, yes ... Yes ...

184
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:22,992
Oh, God, this is good.

185
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,918
Are you done?

186
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:34,408
You want to have a ciggy butt
and cuddle now?

187
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,494
Okay, what is it?

188
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:42,090
Well, remember Glen, the stockbroker?

189
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,524
The one who cost me my beautiful
vacation house.

190
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,398
Did I mention that he said that you
looked just like Heather Locklear?

191
00:13:48,398 --> 00:13:52,538
I never met him.
/ I described you. He was drooling.

192
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,078
Anyway, you're going to get
a big kick out of this.

193
00:13:57,078 --> 00:14:01,091
Glen, the stockbroker,
is really —

194
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:06,840
is this thing on — a hot dog vendor.

195
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:15,595
I know — I know, people, right?
Go figure.

196
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:17,597
So at this very minute,

197
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:20,463
Maxwell is at the Manhattan Men's Club

198
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:27,058
handing over $100,000 to a hot dog vendor
you introduced him to.

199
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:30,858
Yes. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

200
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:34,455
Now, go pick up the phone
and kill that deal.

201
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:38,879
Here you go. Pick up the phone.

202
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:44,930
Just put it in your hand
and dial the number.

203
00:14:45,294 --> 00:14:49,084
Oh, come on, Miss Babcock.
It's your money too.

204
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:55,519
Save a ton of money ... Nanny Fine screwed.
Whoops. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

205
00:14:57,016 --> 00:15:01,031
Please, Miss Babcock,
pick up the phone.

206
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,713
Oh, all right.
/ Thank you, thank you, thank you.

207
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:13,059
Hello, Dr. Bort, cancel my therapy session today.
I don't need it. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

208
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:20,340
Guest of Mr. Sheffield.

209
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:26,731
Sorry. No women allowed.
/ Well, what is this?
The heman women haters' club?

210
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:31,354
This is very important.
I must speak to Mr. Sheffield.
I'm his nanny.

211
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:34,135
Lady, no woman's ever
gotten into this club

212
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:38,930
and no woman's ever going to
figure out how. / Huh ...

213
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:01,696
I thought there were no women allowed?

214
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:04,292
Just the cocktail waitresses, sir.

215
00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:08,088
If I'd known of that, I'd go
straight to Al Capone.

216
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:14,804
Excuse me? / I'll have a brandy Alexander,
skim milk, and put it in a parfait glass.

217
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:20,085
Ah, listen, that's a, that's
a lovely shade of blush you're wearing.

218
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:24,344
You know, chicks like to hear that stuff.

219
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:37,049
Oh, yeah, Maryanne, ah, cancel my appointment
with the, ah, professor.

220
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:45,664
Hey, how you doing?

221
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:50,362
Hello. Maxwell Sheffield,
and, and you are Mr.?

222
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:52,528
Ed?

223
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,846
Well, Mr. Ed; this is Mr. Mitchell.

224
00:16:57,846 --> 00:16:59,410
You can call me Glen.

225
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,732
Oh, well, you can call me Wilbur.

226
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:08,097
Oh, Glen here is a stockmarket wiz.

227
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:11,126
Oh, a real hot dog, huh?

228
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:16,051
As a matter of fact, he gave me
one hell of a stock tip.

229
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:19,389
Oh, no kidding.
/ Yeah, my nanny turned me on to him.

230
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:22,892
Oh. Hey, can I talk to him
for a second? / Yeah.

231
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:27,074
And his nanny turned me on,
period. She is hot.

232
00:17:27,074 --> 00:17:28,847
Ohhh. Would you excuse us
a minute, Glen?

233
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,519
Ah, well, now, Max, it can wait,
it can wait.

234
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:37,500
Go on, go on. / So, Max, what's
the story with you and Fran?

235
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,514
Yeah, what's the story
with you and Fran, Max?

236
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:47,072
I mean she's a beautiful woman who lives
in your house haven't you ever been tempted ...

237
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:50,541
Well, to tell you the truth, Glen ...
/ Here's your brandy Alexander.

238
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,870
♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪

239
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:56,948
Missed it, missed it.
What'd you say?

240
00:17:56,948 --> 00:18:01,144
Yeah, well, I have her wrapped around
my little finger, you know. / Oh, yeah?

241
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,593
Oh, yes, I say things to her like

242
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:07,655
"Oh, but you are so much wiser
than I am" or,

243
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:13,337
or "The, the children are so much more comfortable
talking to you," you know, rot like that.

244
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:17,675
I can't believe she hasn't caught on yet.
/ Uh-huh. She will.

245
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:23,228
Oh, Glen, listen, before I forget,
here's that check I promised you.

246
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:26,729
Oh, no, no. No business
on club premises.

247
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:29,175
I'm a Buddist.

248
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,418
I don't think this concerns you,
Wilbur, old boy.

249
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:34,111
Well, I think it does,
Glen old beef.

250
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,957
Now, listen, buddy ...
/ Hey, hey, give me that back.

251
00:18:37,957 --> 00:18:39,814
Gentlemen, please ...

252
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:42,756
Excuse me.

253
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:57,594
Hey, hey, give that to me. Give that to me.
Give it to me. Give it to me. Ahhhhhh ...

254
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,843
Mr. Sheffield, Mr. Sheffield,
Mr. Sheffield, are you okay?

255
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:11,549
Wilbur?
/ No, it's me, Miss Fine.

256
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:17,487
Oh, thank God, for a moment I found
myself oddly attracted to you.

257
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:21,259
I thought 20 years in musical theater
had finally taken its toll on me.

258
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:24,121
What the, what the hell are you
doing here dressed like that?

259
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,458
Well, it was the only way that
I could get in.

260
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:31,633
Ah, I came to put an end to this
thing between you and Glen.

261
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,311
Won't you — won't you keep
your voice down?

262
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:36,508
It's all right. It's all right.
We live together.

263
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:40,134
Nothing to see here.
Nothing to see here.

264
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,981
What a bunch of yentas.

265
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:46,688
Mr. Sheffield, Mr. Sheffield,
Glen is not a stockbroker.

266
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:50,500
You were about to give $100,000 to
a man that sells hot dogs.

267
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,346
Hot dogs. How many?

268
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:57,504
You lied to me.
/ He lied to both of us.

269
00:19:57,504 --> 00:20:01,018
What were you using me
to get to him?

270
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:02,841
I don't even know you.

271
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:08,497
Oh, so I suppose that afternoon
in the Hamptons meant nothing to you?

272
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,932
Fran?

273
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,988
Oh, I should have known.

274
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:19,111
No chick can eat a whole
six-pound lobster.

275
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:24,655
I had a Slim Fast for lunch
and a sensible dinner.

276
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,609
You said you were a stockbroker.

277
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:33,753
No, I said I worked on Wall Street.

278
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:37,133
Would you have gone out with me
if I told you that I sold hot dogs?

279
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:40,354
Absolutely. But now
all trust is gone.

280
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:44,602
I can't stand a man who pretends
to be something that he's not.

281
00:20:44,824 --> 00:20:47,679
Yeah, well, just for the record,
I was a stockbroker.

282
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,810
I got killed in the '80s.
All I needed was one big client.

283
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:02,007
Maxwell Sheffield was
the man of my dreams.

284
00:21:06,136 --> 00:21:11,084
Boy, I haven't seen a shiner like
this since my sister got her nose job.

285
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:15,109
Take it easy. There.
/ I'll be back in a moment, sir.

286
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:19,077
I have to run down to the market now
that dinner is on your face.

287
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,729
Perhaps Miss Fine would like
to go for you?

288
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:25,946
Maybe she can pick up an ex-doctor
with his own falafel wagon.

289
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:29,727
No, thank you.
I've learned my lesson.

290
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:33,048
Besides, if I want to meet a doctor,
I'll do it the old-fashioned way.

291
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:36,362
Fall in love?
/ Faint in temple.

292
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:39,182
What's up, brother man?

293
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:51,859
You be cool.

294
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,243
Dad, would you get your own stereo?

295
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:57,990
Five more minutes, I could have been
in the park with this.

296
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:03,002
What are we going to do about
that Brighten-big-pants situation?

297
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:05,911
Ah, well, I thought that
you'd talk to him,

298
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:09,580
you know, you're so much wiser
than I am, and,

299
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,514
well, the children are just so much
more comfortable with you,

300
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:16,127
rot like that.

301
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:17,819
Blast.

302
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,615
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Sheffield,

303
00:22:19,615 --> 00:22:23,571
I have my own phrases
to manipulate you too.

304
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:26,375
Really? Like what?

305
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:31,068
Someone should really talk to that Fergie
about horizontal stripes.

306
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,514
What — what phrases?

307
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:36,266
Oh, I'm just kidding.

308
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:41,065
Gosh, Mr. Sheffield, I could
never put anything over on you.

309
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:46,446
I mean you're a big Broadway
producer. I'm just a nanny.

310
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:48,698
Quite right.

311
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:53,172
Well, No. 17 still works.

312
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,345
I'm off work in an hour.

313
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,620
You want to meet me for a drink?

314
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,731
Honey, I got two words for you,

315
00:23:10,731 --> 00:23:13,612
"Crying Game ..."
