1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:04,515
Hey, Fran, did you see?
Billy Ray Cyrus is having a kissing contest

2
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:07,342
at Tower Records to find a girl
for the cover of his new album.

3
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,357
Oh, I love Billy Ray Cyrus.

4
00:00:09,357 --> 00:00:12,105
Remember that cowboy bar
we used to go to in Flushing?

5
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:15,204
Of course.
I'm not just rock 'n roll,

6
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:18,514
I'm a little bit country, too.

7
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:21,384
Oh, they used to have
a mechanical bull.

8
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:25,107
I used to ride that
thing like crazy.

9
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:30,440
Oh, I'll tell you, if he was Jewish
I would have married him.

10
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:34,760
So, are you gonna enter?
/ Oh, are you kidding? I'd never win.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,796
Pamela Chapman is entering.

12
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,713
Oh, she's so gorgeous,
even her mother hates her.

13
00:00:39,713 --> 00:00:44,204
Oh, sweetie, you've got to have
more self-confidence.

14
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:47,437
All of those overdeveloped girls
just peak in high school.

15
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:51,657
Yeah. Remember that girl from our school
who was so beautiful and so popular

16
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:55,291
that everyone thought she would own
the world? Then her fiance dumped her,

17
00:00:55,291 --> 00:01:00,227
she got fired from her job,
and she wound up working as a nan —

18
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:06,494
Fran, were you ever in
a kissing contest?

19
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:10,841
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a contest.

20
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:16,672
I mean, how many contestants
can you fit in a '77 Comet?

21
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:25,544
But I must say, Jerry Swartz and I spent
the better part of the "Blue Lagoon" tongue wrestling.

22
00:01:25,918 --> 00:01:30,861
You mean thumb wrestling?
/ Oh, yes, of course, honey.
That's exactly what I meant.

23
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,862
Thanks for correcting me.

24
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:26,800
Fran, why am I doing this? I don't
have a chance of winning a kissing contest.

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,039
Sweetie, you could do it
with your eyes closed.

26
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,994
Well, actually, you do it
with your eyes open.

27
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:35,002
Fran, you spy on me and Shawn
when we're making out?

28
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:40,808
Honey, spying and living vicariously
are two completely different things.

29
00:02:41,774 --> 00:02:43,746
Shawn? What happened to Peter?

30
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:48,632
Oh, he's got a bad hair cut.
He'll be back in a couple of weeks.

31
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:54,964
Oh, that's Shawn. Oh, how am I going to tell
him that I'm entering a kissing contest?

32
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:59,411
Sweetie, just slip it into
the conversation. Be subtle.

33
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:02,089
Hi, Shawn.
/ Hi, Maggie.

34
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:04,693
Hi, Fran.
/ Hi, sweetie.

35
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:09,931
Oh, look at this, a kissing contest.
/ Oh, let's enter.

36
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:19,058
Meanwhile, she's fighting 'em off with a stick,
and I'm having impure thoughts about Judge Ito ...

37
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:29,131
Honey, you might as well tell Shawn.
Now is as good a time as any.

38
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:32,554
Wrong! Red alert!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

39
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:36,035
Mating season in Queens, Miss Fine?
/ Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

40
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:40,161
Hello, darling, how's my little girl?

41
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:46,382
Margaret ...

42
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:55,854
Um, it's a — a Peter, right?

43
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:59,230
Shawn, daddy.
/ Oh, yes, right. Ah, Shawn.

44
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,453
Well, of course, in England Peter
is short for Shawn,

45
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:06,507
which is one of
the many reasons why I left.

46
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,891
Let me show you how to be subtle.

47
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:15,356
Speaking of England, does everybody know
that Billy Ray Cyrus is holding a kissing contest

48
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:19,139
to see what girl is going to be
on the cover of his latest CD?

49
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,911
Kissing contest, huh?
/ Uh-huh.

50
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:25,628
Yeah. Not a bad ruse to get thousands
of girls to corrupt. / I'll tell you ...

51
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:28,542
Tough job, hey, lad?

52
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:32,787
Man, think about it. Girls lining up
all dying to kiss you ...

53
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,755
Nah. When I'm in that situation,

54
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:38,322
I pick out the prettiest girl;
I take her home;

55
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:42,591
she puts on something sexy,
and then I ...

56
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:47,640
wake up, and Niles makes me
a really big bowl of Captain Crunch.

57
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:57,917
Speaking of Captain Crunch, I guess it's
no problem that Maggie enters the contest.

58
00:04:57,917 --> 00:04:58,972
What? / What?

59
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:01,255
Maggie, I'm not letting you do this.

60
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:03,517
Shawn, you can't tell me what to do.
You don't own me.

61
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:07,278
Absolutely right. I do.
Margaret, no contest.

62
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:09,711
Oh, come on, daddy,
all my friends are doing it.

63
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:13,427
Ah, Maggie, Maggie, Oz has spoken.

64
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:15,441
Good-bye. Go.

65
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,264
Take the Dutch boy.

66
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:22,976
Ohhh ... You're going to work on him.

67
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:27,254
Ohhh, so you're going to work on me, hey?

68
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:30,487
No, Mr. Sheffield, I am not
going to work on you.

69
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,769
In fact, I happen to agree with you.
/ I beg your pardon?

70
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:38,808
Well, you saw how upset Shawn got. I mean,
he can't stand the thought of her kissing anyone else.

71
00:05:38,808 --> 00:05:43,373
If she enters the contest,
it could bust those two kids up.

72
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:46,841
We'd never see Shawn again.

73
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,327
Ah, Miss Fine ... / Yes?

74
00:05:50,327 --> 00:05:53,513
Perhaps you're being a little too harsh
on Margaret. / Oh, am I?

75
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:59,169
Well, yeah. I mean, after all, all of
her friends are going to be doing it. / Oh, okay.

76
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:14,462
Standing in line for hours
reminds me of home.

77
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:16,475
You know, we only had one bathroom.

78
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:21,845
My father would go in with the Sunday morning paper
and not come out until "Murder She Wrote."

79
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:25,232
Fran, I don't stand a chance.
All these girls are so sexy.

80
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:28,781
Oh, sweetie, they've got nothing on you.

81
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:33,406
In fact, you've got something that
they lost a long time ago.

82
00:06:33,406 --> 00:06:35,895
You still got it, don't you?

83
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,065
Oh, no. There's Pamela Chapman.

84
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,837
That gorgeous, stuck-up snob. Hi.

85
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,902
Oh, sweetie, she's no threat to —

86
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:51,041
wow! I didn't know Brad Pitt
and Claudia Schiffer had a kid.

87
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:57,081
All right, well, honey, you just go
in there and get it over with ...

88
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:03,271
Ah, you, honey, come here.

89
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,612
I'm from Homina, Homina Records,

90
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:10,481
and you don't need to wait in line.
You made the cut. / Really?

91
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:14,812
Ssshhh! Ssshhh! You know what would
happen if anyone found out that I was here?

92
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:16,993
Now write this down.

93
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:23,832
Now, go to, ah, 1313 Mockingbird Lane.

94
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:29,503
Ask for Lilly or Herman.
/ Thank you.

95
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:35,213
Oh, I feel terrible. So awful.

96
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:39,189
You, honey, come here.
I'm from Homina Homina —

97
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:43,157
Fran, Fran ... Oh, my gosh,
that was so cool.

98
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:50,591
He is so cool. This is so cool.
You've gotta do it.

99
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:54,347
Oh, what? Are you kidding?
/ Oh, why not? For a goof. Come on.

100
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:59,710
Oh, sweetie, I came here for you.
I'm not gonna waltz myself up to Billy Ray Cyrus,

101
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,750
throw my arms around his neck,
and suck those farm boy lips off.

102
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,451
I wouldn't know where to begin.

103
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:12,518
Oh, come on. Go for it.
It's really fun, Fran.

104
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:16,734
Well, it's fun for you to kiss
a celebrity, but I get kissed —

105
00:08:16,734 --> 00:08:18,664
out of my way.

106
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,705
Do it, Fran!

107
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:27,068
How could you do it, Fran?
/ Well, you told me to go for it.

108
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:30,658
Well, I didn't tell you to win.

109
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:36,995
I'm sorry. My mouth has a mind of
its own. There's no stopping it.

110
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:41,512
Never a truer word spoken. All right.
So what's going on here?

111
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:47,414
I can't believe it. By tomorrow, everybody
at school's gonna know that my nanny
beat me out of the kissing contest.

112
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:54,624
What? You won the contest?
/ Well, if you want to call it a contest.

113
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,234
Well, as far as your winning
this contest is concerned,

114
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:02,315
we'll sort this nonsense out in
no time. / Nonsense?

115
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:05,121
Well, Miss Fine, you don't seriously
think you actually won, do you?

116
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:07,550
I mean, they were looking for
a beautiful teenager.

117
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:12,704
And lovely as you are, you're not
exactly a teenager, hey?

118
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:19,987
Well, I remember my graduation a lot better
than some people that I won't spell it out for Y-O-U.

119
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:22,504
Oh, please, Miss Fine, you don't
seriously expect me to believe

120
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:25,923
you beat out hundreds of young girls
just because of your kissing prowess?

121
00:09:25,923 --> 00:09:30,251
No. I beat them because
I happen to be a fabulous kisser.

122
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:34,095
Don't you think you you've gone just
a little overboard on the hyperbole?

123
00:09:34,402 --> 00:09:37,387
I'm wearing "Obsession."

124
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:43,795
Miss Fine, this is insanity. There's absolutely
no way you could have won that contest legitimately.

125
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:45,043
Oh, no? / No.

126
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,662
Oh, yeah? / Yeah.

127
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:49,307
Well, you asked for it, buster.

128
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:16,173
I'm sorry I had to get tough
with you, but you had to learn.

129
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:18,916
Ah ...

130
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,977
Yes ...

131
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:25,552
Well, um ... right. Of course.

132
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,834
Ah, you know, Miss Fine, I ...

133
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:31,971
I thought I considered every
possible scenario.

134
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:35,080
Maggie wins, and I'm miserable.
Maggie loses; she's miserable.

135
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:41,199
But, ah-ha, here's a wild card.
You win, and we're all miserable.

136
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:48,694
Meanwhile, if you're so miserable, how come
I know you had clams casino and a side salad for lunch?

137
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:55,156
Decaf cappuccino and
a bite of cream broulett ...

138
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,470
I thought you were off the sweets.

139
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,589
Miss Fine ...

140
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,276
Miss Fine, you have to consider
my position in this.

141
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:08,091
I — I have a certain stature
in the community.

142
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:11,316
I can't have you kissing someone
on an album cover.

143
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:14,366
You're my nanny for heaven sakes.
/ Your nanny?

144
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:19,996
Is that what I am to you?
Your nanny? / Well, yes.

145
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:23,483
All right. You caught me
on a technicality.

146
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:26,974
I cannot have the person that's raising
my children doing something like this.

147
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:30,803
Well, who said I was gonna do it?
/ Well, I thought you just won the contest?

148
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:35,797
Well, what does that have to do with anything?
Oh, you're such a man sometimes.

149
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:39,650
Don't you realize that your daughter
has a very low self-esteem.

150
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,185
Something like this could crush her.
Is that what you want?

151
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:50,965
No. No. What I want right now is to be in
a pub with my hands wrapped around a tall Lager.

152
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:54,364
A logger?

153
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:06,441
Do the kids know that you're
considering an alternate life-style?

154
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:11,468
It's a beer, Miss Fine.
/ Oh. Well, speak English.

155
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:16,223
If you had absolutely no intention of
going through with this album cover
in the first place, what are we arguing about?

156
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:20,887
Well, I have no idea. I can't shake
the image of you picking up Paul Bunyan in a bar.

157
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,386
God ...

158
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:28,788
it would be easier to have
them raised by wolves.

159
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,606
Do you think I went overboard
with this ensemble?

160
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:44,516
No. You look just like when my Hebrew school
did "The Best Little Whore House in Texas."

161
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:48,967
This is so exciting.
I'm gonna meet Billy Ray Cyrus.

162
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:53,073
I wonder if he's related
to Sugar Ray Leonard?

163
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:57,568
Oh, he is so gorgeous.
Take a picture of us.

164
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,088
Try and look lifelike.

165
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,010
There he is. There he is.

166
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,361
Oh, he's so hot.
Look at that body, those eyes.

167
00:13:12,361 --> 00:13:14,576
Hi, Fran. / Hi ...

168
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,705
She's perfect, Billy Ray.
/ Isn't she?

169
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:22,626
Oh, thank you, Mr. Cyrus.
Oh, Mr. Cyrus, that sounds funny.

170
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:28,585
Gee, you know, if Emily Bronti married
you, her name would be Bronti-Cyrus.

171
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:39,691
Anyway, Mr. Cyrus, as flattered as
I am that you picked me to be your kiss girl,

172
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,485
I can't be on your album cover.

173
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:45,879
You're turning us down?
/ I'm afraid I have to.

174
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:49,073
You don't want to be in my new video?
/ No.

175
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:53,869
You don't want to be the kiss girl
on my European tour? / No.

176
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:58,647
How about a couple tickets to the Grammys.
There's a party at Streisand's after.

177
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:01,354
What are we really talking about here?

178
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:05,191
The kid is an heiress. She's got
tooth picks for thighs. She'll bounce back.

179
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:08,008
Go. Go. Go.
/ No! No! No!

180
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:12,188
I'm sorry. But I can't.
/ Honey, you gotta do it.

181
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:14,234
You look great with Billy Ray.

182
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:18,185
Those teenagers made him look
a little long in the tooth. / What?

183
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:22,448
Fran, what my ex-manager
is trying to say is

184
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:25,720
kissing you will appeal
to a much broader audience.

185
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,554
Yeah. Older broads.

186
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,653
Was I drunk when I hired you?

187
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:36,444
I am not an older broad. Tell him, Val.

188
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:40,202
Well, you're older than me.
/ Shut up, Val!

189
00:14:40,202 --> 00:14:42,961
I'm sorry, but my mind is made up.

190
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:45,899
Darling, this is a great opportunity
for a woman like you.

191
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,379
You just gonna walk on out of
here with nothing?

192
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:52,809
No. I am gonna walk out knowing that
I did not destroy the self-esteem

193
00:14:52,809 --> 00:15:00,062
of a very insecure young heiress.
And that's all I need.

194
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:04,034
Come on, Val. Help me carry
this on the bus.

195
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:12,375
Oh, how many times have I asked you
children to close the refrigerator?

196
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,273
What?

197
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:19,529
Miss Fine, I've told you there's
nothing to be depressed about.

198
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:23,908
You are a beautiful young woman.
What are you? Thirty-two? Thirty-four?

199
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,199
You better be talking about my bra size,

200
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:32,106
or you're gonna become awfully
chummy with a turkey leg.

201
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:37,599
Fran, I'm sorry I made such a big deal
about the contest. Hey, the best woman won.

202
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:43,920
Oh, honey, stop knocking yourself.
Being the best had nothing to do with it.

203
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:51,770
Being the one most likely to pass a liver spot
off as a coffee stain is what put me over the top.

204
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:58,064
Bottom line, you made him look old,
and I made him look young.

205
00:15:58,064 --> 00:15:59,488
Really?

206
00:15:59,488 --> 00:16:03,568
Sweetie, you're too beautiful.
That's your only curse.

207
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:07,349
Fran, I love you. / I love you more.

208
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,309
Hey, at least Pamela didn't win.

209
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:14,174
I heard some lady at the contest sent
her on some wild-goose chase.

210
00:16:14,937 --> 00:16:17,965
Oh, that's terrible.

211
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:20,682
Gee, did they say if they saw who it was?

212
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:24,612
Oh, no. The girls just said
it was some older lady.

213
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,296
Fabulous ...

214
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:36,440
Oh, Niles, know what the worst
part of it all is —

215
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,154
not that in five years my touche is
going to need training wheels —

216
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:44,041
but that Mr. Sheffield was right.

217
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:47,855
I mean, where do I come off thinking
I can compete with young girls?

218
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:51,402
Well, it was a little far-fetched.

219
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:54,581
Niles, don't help me.
I don't need your two cents.

220
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,655
Oh, but I will need a twenty.
That's my pizza.

221
00:16:57,655 --> 00:17:00,602
Miss Fine, we're having dinner in an hour.

222
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,507
I know. Why do you think
I ordered thin crust?

223
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:05,804
Thank you. Keep the change.

224
00:17:06,102 --> 00:17:09,551
Oh, hi, Miss Babcock.

225
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,761
So, Niles, what's wrong with Nanny Fine?

226
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:18,380
Oh, come on, Niles, tell me
or I'll just die.

227
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,460
You say it, but you don't mean it.

228
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,942
Miss Fine won the contest because they
were looking for an older woman.

229
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:32,710
There. Now, I suppose you'll run and tell
Mr. Sheffield because somehow in your sick,

230
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,535
twisted mind this will make you
appear more appealing.

231
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,438
Niles, please, that is beneath me.

232
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:55,390
May I help you?

233
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,716
Nanny Fine's old. / What?

234
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:01,155
She didn't win the contest cause
she's a good kisser.

235
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:05,594
She won it because they wanted
someone really old like her.

236
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:10,286
Old? Oh, that's preposterous.
I mean, what is she? Twenty-nine? Thirty?

237
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:15,164
Oh, please, to what power?

238
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,326
I mean, do we really know how old she
is under all that makeup? She could be —

239
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:24,939
Your age.

240
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:30,495
That's right. She could be close to —
forget it, Niles.

241
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:32,809
Oh, it is so pathetic.

242
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:38,094
Nanny Fine thinking she could win a kissing
contest. I mean, kissing is an art.

243
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:41,619
It has to be sensuous, deeply felt,

244
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,843
and most of all, it has
to be spontaneous.

245
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:58,797
Was it as bad for you as it was for me?

246
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:06,721
Oh, poor Miss Fine.
And I was so insensitive to her.

247
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:09,388
Maybe I should go see if she's all right.

248
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:11,787
No. No, wait. Come back.

249
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:26,659
Didn't work out quite as
you planned, did it?

250
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:29,986
You set me up. You —

251
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:34,239
the run, the chase, getting
stuck in the door, everything.

252
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:38,900
My mental health is just
a sick game to you, isn't it?

253
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,778
Rack 'em up. Let's play again.

254
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:53,594
Miss Fine? / Oh, um, don't come in.
I'm not dressed ...

255
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:59,147
Come in ...

256
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:05,036
Miss Fine, I do hope you'll
be coming down to dinner.

257
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:08,136
I can't have my favorite
nanny wasting away.

258
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:11,552
I don't think I could eat.

259
00:20:13,106 --> 00:20:15,473
Do I — do I smell pizza?

260
00:20:15,473 --> 00:20:20,640
No. No. That's just Glade's
new Italian fresh scent.

261
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:24,085
Miss Fine, I —
I heard about the contest,

262
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:28,140
and I just can't bear the thought of you
feeling badly about yourself.

263
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,360
Oh, thank you, Mr. Sheffield.
That's awfully sweet of you,

264
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,868
but really, there's nothing you can say or
do that's gonna make me feel any better.

265
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,317
Well, then I suppose
I'd be wasting my breath

266
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:44,497
if I told you that I think no girl could
possibly be a match for a woman like you.

267
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:47,342
I'd give it a shot.

268
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:51,005
Why are you Americans so
obsessed with youth?

269
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:54,800
You know, I prefer the more civilized
European sensibility that —

270
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,649
that people improve with age, like —
like fine wine ...

271
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:03,193
especially a beautiful wine
that's robust and earthly,

272
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:06,637
yet sweet and strangely compelling.

273
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:10,365
Oh, you're good.

274
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:14,753
One more thing before
I stop wasting my breath.

275
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:18,246
I think you are
one heck of a kisser.

276
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:23,432
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, stop. Go on.

277
00:21:23,646 --> 00:21:26,219
Well, I can't remember
being kissed like that.

278
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:29,608
As a matter of fact, I don't think
I've ever been kissed quite like that before.

279
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:34,243
No more. I'm blushing. Like what?

280
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:38,408
Well, with such passion.
Such abandon. Such ...

281
00:21:38,408 --> 00:21:42,472
Such ...
/ Suction.

282
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:50,031
Yeah, well, Danny used to always
call me his little Dirt Devil.

283
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:53,218
Really? Isn't that charming.

284
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:56,594
Oh, Mr. Sheffield, you are so wonderful.

285
00:21:56,594 --> 00:22:00,561
Here I was eating my heart out,

286
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:04,651
and then you come up and make me feel
so much better. You're such a doll.

287
00:22:04,651 --> 00:22:08,416
I could just ...
/ Just what, Miss Fine?

288
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,047
Kiss you.
/ Oh.

289
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:17,321
Oh, well, far be it for me to refuse
a token of gratitude from a lady.

290
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:26,016
Thank you, Mr. Sheffield.

291
00:22:26,016 --> 00:22:30,200
It's nice to know I've still got it.
