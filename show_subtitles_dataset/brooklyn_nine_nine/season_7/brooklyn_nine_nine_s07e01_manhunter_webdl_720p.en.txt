1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,760
- Look, we all know
Scully has the hardest head,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,720
but what concerns me
is the speed factor.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,360
- Squad, listen up!
- Not now, Terry.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,020
We're having an argument
about who would win in a fight

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,230
if we couldn't use our arms.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,020
- Everyone agrees,
I'd bite the best.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,460
- Meaningless!

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,890
True strength comes
from the pelvis, not the mouth.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,250
- There's been
an assassination attempt!

10
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,900
- What?

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,250
And you let us just sit around
talking about Boyle's pelvis?

12
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,170
- I didn't let you!

13
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,080
Councilman Bosworth was giving
a speech at Garfield Plaza.

14
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,080
He was shot in the shoulder.

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,600
Now, he's in stable condition,

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,900
but the shooter's
still at large!

17
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,390
We have to move!

18
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,040
We're locking down a ten-block
radius around the scene.

19
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,250
No traffic in or out.

20
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,470
We think our man
is still inside the area.

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,220
ESU is on-site.

22
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,870
I'll be leading the op
from a mobile command center.

23
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,880
Santiago is running
perimeter control.

24
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,230
Peralta, you're in charge
of the manhunt for the shooter.

25
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,230
- Oh, my God, it's a manhunt.

26
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,190
And I'm the Manhunter.

27
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,710
- And I'm your sidekick,
the Boyhunter.

28
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,050
- Come on, dude.
- I'm gonna be on the news.

29
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,750
I'm gonna look straight
into the camera and say,

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,890
"If the shooter is watching,
I hope you like living

31
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,710
between St. Charles Place
and Connecticut Ave."

32
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,290
- I don't get it.
- It's from "Monopoly."

33
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,160
That's where jail is.

34
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,810
Whatever, it was a good line.
Keep briefing!

35
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,020
- Diaz, Santiago,

36
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,460
the Command Tent's
on the northeast corner.

37
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,600
We need to work fast.

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,300
The mayor's only given us
five hours

39
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,430
until the barricades
are lifted.

40
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,690
- Five hours?

41
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,860
Tell him the Manhunter
only needs one.

42
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,220
- Love that,
but I'm gonna keep it at five.

43
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,480
It's already way
too little time.

44
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,910
All right,
I'm seeing security cameras.

45
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,170
I need all that footage.

46
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,000
I need forensics
to run a full sweep of—

47
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,080
hey, what are all these
civilians doing here?

48
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,430
Who's responsible for securing
the area, who screwed this up?

49
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,610
- Hi, I'm Officer Debbie Fogle.

50
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,710
I'm so sorry,
my partner's on crowd control.

51
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,190
I don't know where he went.

52
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,490
It's his first week on the job,

53
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,700
so he's still
learning the ropes.

54
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,830
- All right, listen, Fogle.

55
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,920
We have a councilman
in the hospital

56
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,320
and his shooter
is still at large.

57
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,810
We don't have time
for this incompetence.

58
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,410
I want your partner
off the case, what's his name?

59
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,640
- It's Raymond Holt.

60
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,670
- Oh!

61
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,900
It's Dad—
I mean, Captain Holt!

62
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,070
I mean, Captain Dad.

63
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,110
I mean, Officer Holt.

64
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,340
I mean, Officer Dad.

65
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,950
Yep, that was it.
Officer Dad, I found it.

66
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,130
- Detective, I thought
I saw a clue on the sidewalk.

67
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,830
I apologize for not
properly securing the scene.

68
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,890
- No need to apologize,
I wasn't even that mad.

69
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,150
- You said you wanted
whoever messed up off the case.

70
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,670
- It doesn't matter.

71
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,840
The point is, no one
needs to get in trouble.

72
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,280
- Look,
you don't have to pity me

73
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,930
just because Madeline Wuntch
demoted me for a year.

74
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,420
I've been stripped
of my accomplishments

75
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,980
and lost the respect
of everyone in my life...

76
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,020
including my dog.

77
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,340
- Cheddar?
No.

78
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,150
- Yes!
Now...

79
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,150
he only poops for Kevin.

80
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,460
- Oh, sir.

81
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,820
- We don't have time
to take all this in,

82
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,210
there's a shooter on the loose!

83
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,470
Are you guys gonna be okay
working together or not?

84
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,510
- Of course we will,

85
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
I took an oath
to protect this city

86
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,160
no matter what my rank.

87
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,470
I have no problem

88
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,830
with Detective Peralta
being my commander.

89
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,960
- And I have no problem
commanding him.

90
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Here, watch this.

91
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,530
Captain, will you please
lock down North 3rd Street,

92
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,010
if that's okay with you,
Captain?

93
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,140
- It certainly is!

94
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,610
- Impressed?

95
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,140
- You said "please" and you
called him "Captain" twice.

96
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,570
- Yeah, we don't have time
for this, Lieutenant.

97
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,670
There's a shooter
on the loose!

98
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,320
- Traffic is shut down.

99
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,970
Civilians are being funneled
into the checkpoints.

100
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,400
- Good,
just wish my guys over here

101
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,410
could be a little
more efficient.

102
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,010
Yeah, I'm looking at you,

103
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,450
Detective Fuzzy Paws!

104
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,160
- Is this Amy-hates-dogs-Amy
or Amy-extra-stressed-Amy?

105
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,110
- It's both Amys!
I'm under a lot of pressure.

106
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,240
And also,
that dog is a piece of trash!

107
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,340
- Okay.

108
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,600
I can tell
something else is going on,

109
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,860
you don't have to pretend
to be mad at the dog.

110
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,990
- First of all,
I'm not pretending.

111
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,120
That dog sucks!

112
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,420
Also...

113
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,080
My period's late,
I think I might be pregnant.

114
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,030
- Oh, damn.
- I can't be pregnant!

115
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,420
Jake and I agreed to wait
at least a year until we tried.

116
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,600
I haven't found an OB,

117
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,130
I'm not on any preschool
waiting lists,

118
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,560
and I spent all of yesterday

119
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,090
in a room with Hitchcock
and his new cologne,

120
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,390
which can't be good
for the baby—

121
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,750
it is literally called

122
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,530
Zika!

123
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,920
- Okay, relax,

124
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
You're probably not pregnant,
it's entirely possible

125
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,540
Hitchcock's cologne
disrupted your cycle.

126
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,020
- Right, yes.

127
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,140
That is a very real
possibility.

128
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,710
- Santiago!
- Ah!

129
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,010
- What's going on here?
Is everything okay?

130
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,980
- Yeah, totes!

131
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,110
Right, Rosa?

132
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,720
- Uh, totes.

133
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,460
- Why is everyone
being all weird today?

134
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,070
Just get back to work
and be normal.

135
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,290
- Yes, sir!
Will do, we'll be normal.

136
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,470
Nothing to stress about here.

137
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,900
Hey, Fuzzy Paws!

138
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm paying you to work,
not lick your butthole!

139
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,650
- Yeah, I'm gonna get you
a pregnancy test.

140
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,940
- Okay, I know you haven't
done this in a while,

141
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,950
so here's a tip—
keep your hat on.

142
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,130
Because of all
the standing still,

143
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,820
the pigeons think we're statues

144
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,270
and they will poop on you
or peck you.

145
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,620
Both are bad.

146
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,440
- Thank you
for the helpful tip.

147
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,740
- Oh, I've got a ton of them.

148
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,930
They're mostly about
the dangers of standing.

149
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,280
A year on the beat
without prescription insoles

150
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,100
can take two years
off your life.

151
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,530
- Any way to speed
the process up?

152
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,580
Okay, I've got
a funny guy for a partner.

153
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,590
But seriously, you have to
monitor your foot health.

154
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,710
I'll gonna send you
a pedometer app that I use.

155
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,500
You're gonna love it.
It has robust social features.

156
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,380
We can give each
other "foot-fives"!

157
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,510
- No, thank you,

158
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,720
I keep count of my steps
in my head,

159
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,820
like a normal person.

160
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,520
I'm up to 6,743 for the day.

161
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,000
- Okay Boyle, it's time
for the Manhunter

162
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,610
to hunt... man.

163
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,520
- ♪ Ooh, here he comes

164
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,830
♪ Watch out, men,
he'll hunt you down ♪

165
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,610
♪ Ooh, here he comes

166
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,270
♪ Jake's a manhunter!

167
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,140
- Charles—
I love that.

168
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,610
Keep doing the song
while I work the scene.

169
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,090
- You got it!

170
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,710
- Okay, bullet lodged there

171
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,970
is 4 feet
below the hole in the backdrop

172
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,930
indicating a trajectory
of about 15 degrees,

173
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,060
which means the shot was taken

174
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,590
from either
the second or third floor

175
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,810
of one of the buildings
across the plaza.

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,980
- ♪ Ooh, here he comes

177
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,670
- That building's windows
don't open.

178
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,460
- ♪ Watch out men,
he'll hunt you down ♪

179
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,850
- That one's obscured by trees.
- ♪ Ooh, here he comes

180
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,290
- Which means that the shooter
must've been located—

181
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,550
- On the sky bridge.

182
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,470
- ♪ Jake's a manhunter

183
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,560
- Officer Holt.
- Mm.

184
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,560
- I thought I stationed you...

185
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,950
not here!

186
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,900
- Right.

187
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,090
I'm just here in the plaza

188
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,000
looking for, um...

189
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,440
this!

190
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,660
- A half-eaten box
of McNuggets?

191
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,090
- Yup, it's my lunch.
- Uh-huh.

192
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,300
And what type of food
is a McNugget?

193
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,880
- Some type of a...
paella?

194
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,530
- You had to know
that was a bad guess.

195
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,570
- Well, the point is,
I needed my paella

196
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,670
and I noticed the sky bridge,

197
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,150
so I thought I might
be of some help,

198
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,670
but I'll just go back

199
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,240
and stand next
to a piece of police tape

200
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,240
and do nothing.

201
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,590
- Wait, stop.

202
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,810
How would you like
to stick around

203
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,330
and assist on the case?

204
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,460
- You sure, Jake, I mean,

205
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,980
there's only room
for one Manhunter.

206
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,410
- Boyle is right,
I don't want to overstep.

207
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,770
- You're not overstepping.

208
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,420
- I mean, he interrupted
the song, but whatever.

209
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,590
- Great,
I'll just leave my paella

210
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,170
on the ground,
save it for later.

211
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,980
- We all know
that's not your lunch!

212
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,200
So, the shooter
was standing right here.

213
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,940
A standard long gun
would've ejected the casing

214
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,640
right over...

215
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,260
there, where Holt
is already putting down

216
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,610
an evidence marker.

217
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,260
- Yes, I found it
quite quickly.

218
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,000
- Great, thank you for saving
me the trouble of doing my job.

219
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,470
- Oh, sorry.

220
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,260
Would you like me to pick
the evidence marker back up

221
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,580
so you can place it
on the ground?

222
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,090
- Yes!
- No, of course not.

223
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,270
Good work.

224
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,000
both: I bet the shooter
went that way.

225
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,750
- Sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

226
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,580
both: Follow me
to the service entrance.

227
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,050
- Ugh, we did it again.
I'm so sorry.

228
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,670
- It's really no problem.
- Great!

229
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,100
Follow me, everyone!

230
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,850
- Wait, what?

231
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,280
- Security footage showed
no cars leaving the area,

232
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,990
so our shooter
must've left here on foot.

233
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,200
- He's taking over
your case, Jake.

234
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,590
You have to stop him.

235
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,250
- Well, you know,
it takes a true leader

236
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,690
to let someone else lead.

237
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,120
- Ugh, sounds exactly
like something I would say.

238
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,380
Snap out of it.

239
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,390
- Look, it's fine, I just—

240
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,820
I feel sorry for him, okay?

241
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,600
His assignment was
standing next to tape.

242
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,740
I'm still gonna crack the case.

243
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,090
- I cracked the case.
- Come on!

244
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,220
- Hot dog man,
tell them what you told me.

245
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,180
- I saw a guy,
mid-height, brown hair,

246
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,050
and a green hoodie
with an owl on it.

247
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,570
He had a big bag
and he was running like hell.

248
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,130
- It sounds like our guy.

249
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,450
All right, let's call it in to
give a statement to the press.

250
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,710
- Great idea.

251
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,530
- He knows that I meant I would
give the statement, right?

252
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,840
- And if the shooter's
watching,

253
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,230
I hope you like living

254
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,760
between St. Charles Place
and Connecticut Avenue.

255
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
- Because that's where jail is
in "Monopoly."

256
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,680
A great line from a great man,
or should I say,

257
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,940
Manhunter.

258
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,630
- Yeah, he overstepped.

259
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,560
- Boyle, gather everyone up.

260
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,690
- Oh, we starting a burn book
about Holt?

261
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,690
Let's drag him, baby!

262
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,250
- No, someone saw
our hoodie guy.

263
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,610
- Right,
we'll do the burn book later.

264
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,830
- Attention, everyone,
we have a possible sighting

265
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,180
of our shooter on Hoyt Street.

266
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,340
Detective Boyle and I
will take Alpha unit.

267
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,570
Smith, Fox—
- You guard the burn book.

268
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,830
- Charles, no.
- Stand down.

269
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,010
- You take Bravo unit.

270
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,310
The rest of you,
continue to sweep the area

271
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,610
in case this lead
doesn't pan out.

272
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,180
The clock is ticking,
go, go, go!

273
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,390
- Where should I go, Detective?
I'd love to be of service.

274
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,700
- Captain Holt!
I mean... dude!

275
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,450
I haven't seen you since
your big news conference

276
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,710
which I just loved.

277
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,880
- Ray, there you are!

278
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,540
I can't believe
you left your post again.

279
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,270
Detectives, I'm sorry for
my partner's bad boy behavior.

280
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,930
- I am not a bad boy,

281
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,810
I'm trying to catch bad boys!

282
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,720
If anything, I'm a good boy.

283
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,760
- That's exactly
what a bad boy would say.

284
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,860
- It's definitely not,
and no need to apologize,

285
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,950
we have a job to do.

286
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,470
- Great!
Where do you want us?

287
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,650
- Someone matching
our shooter's profile

288
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,130
was just seen
over on Atlantic and 4th,

289
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,810
I need you both there
immediately, can you handle it?

290
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,120
- Absolutely not,

291
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,300
it sounds like
way too much responsibility.

292
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,950
- Don't listen to Debbie.
We're on it!

293
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,870
- All right.
Bye!

294
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,730
- What's going on?
The guy's on Hoyt Street.

295
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,470
- I know, I gave Holt
a fake lead to get rid of him.

296
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,170
Don't worry, I'm still...

297
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,260
the Manhunter.

298
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,750
- ♪ He's the Manhunter!

299
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,360
♪ And the boy
who he hunts with ♪

300
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,490
- What's that song?
- The Boyhunter song!

301
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,490
♪ Boyhunter

302
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,010
♪ Down by the schoolyard

303
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,410
- Why is he by the schoolyard?

304
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,760
- He's gotta protect the kids!
- Sounds terrible.

305
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,320
- Really, I don't hear it!
- Let's just go.

306
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,270
- Okay, good news.

307
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,490
I found a bodega
in the containment zone

308
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,850
and got a bunch
of pregnancy tests.

309
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,420
- A bunch?
- Yeah.

310
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,810
It's a New York bodega,
you can't be too cautious.

311
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,380
- Good point.
Yep, expired ten years ago.

312
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,470
- Open.
And used!

313
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,860
- Made of gummies?
Why?

314
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,160
- Weirdly vibrating.

315
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,420
- This is for teens.
That's dark.

316
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,300
- This is good.

317
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,690
- Great, let's do this.

318
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,520
- Hey, Santiago,
nice work at checkpoint one.

319
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,350
Wait, why are you guys
being all weird again?

320
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,390
- We're not being weird.

321
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,740
- Do not dab!

322
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,260
- I wasn't going to.

323
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,520
- I know what's going on here.

324
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,340
- You do?
- Yep.

325
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,780
You're talking about me.

326
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,840
I know 'cause my daughters
are doing the same thing.

327
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,910
Every time I go in that room,
they get all weird and quiet.

328
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,390
That's 'cause
they're making fun of Daddy.

329
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,130
Is that what you're doing,
making fun of Daddy?

330
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,350
- First off—

331
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,750
- Yeah, I heard it, I'm sorry.
- Great.

332
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,280
Secondly,
we're not talking about you.

333
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,800
- What are you
talking about, then?

334
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,620
- Our favorite...

335
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,540
porns.

336
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,670
- What?
- It's true.

337
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,940
We have specific
favorite porns.

338
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,550
And we're talking about 'em.

339
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,720
Yeah.

340
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
- Okay, legally,

341
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,380
I feel as though
I need to back away.

342
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,210
But I want it to be known that
I still do not believe you.

343
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,380
Get back to work!

344
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,810
- Eh, that went well.
All right.

345
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,170
Let's take this thing
and get it over with.

346
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,690
- I can't.
- What? Why?

347
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,820
- I have no pee inside of me.

348
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,030
I'm pee-free, Rosa!

349
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,030
What do I do, what do I do?

350
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,380
- Drink water.

351
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,690
- Oh, yeah.
You're smart.

352
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,310
You're a very good friend,
I'm glad you're here.

353
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,530
- Street's clear.

354
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,180
No sign of the shooter,
where'd he go?

355
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,220
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Why are you shushing me?

356
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,530
- I'm doing that thing
where I listen

357
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,700
really closely
for a noise clue,

358
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,190
like glass breaking
or trash rustling.

359
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,840
- Cool!
Is it working?

360
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,400
- No, not yet.

361
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,760
- Because I'm talking?
- Well, it's not helping.

362
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,330
- Right, right, right.
I'll be quiet.

363
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,660
- You don't have to say
you'll be quiet, just be quiet.

364
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,540
- Okay.
I'm sorry for not being quiet.

365
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,850
- Once again,
don't have to say.

366
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,410
- Just wanna be clear
what I'm doing.

367
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,590
- Understood.
I'm just gonna listen.

368
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,540
- Okay.
I'll be very quiet.

369
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,460
- Don't have to say it.

370
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,860
- Just wanna make sure
you know what I'm doing.

371
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,120
- Please stop.
- So I don't throw you.

372
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,240
- Okay, stop talking.

373
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,160
- I'll stop talking.
- Great.

374
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,650
- I'll make sure
I don't do that again.

375
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,130
- All right, Charles,
I love you, but you ruined it.

376
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,390
both: Trash rustle!

377
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,430
- He's running, call it in!

378
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,480
I'll follow, you cut him off!

379
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,410
Damn it!

380
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,590
- Nice, Charles!

381
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,110
- Name's not Charles,
it's...

382
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,200
Boyhunter.

383
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,200
- You know what, you earned it.

384
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,110
Way to get your boy, Boyhunter!

385
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,320
All right, let's get our perp
back to the Nine-Nine.

386
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,020
I'll tell Jeffords
to lift the lockdown.

387
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,470
- Detective Peralta!

388
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,690
I see you got the man
you were looking for.

389
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,860
- With your help, officer!

390
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,300
I really couldn't have
done it without you.

391
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,560
- No, this was all you.

392
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,210
We were in a completely
wrong location.

393
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,810
- Which was a huge relief
to me.

394
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,210
Plus, we got a lot of steps in.

395
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,870
I'm drowning in foot-fives.

396
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,660
- Well, no need
to focus on who was where

397
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,210
or what a foot-five is,

398
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,910
we gotta start brainstorming
headlines for tomorrow's paper.

399
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,310
- I got one.

400
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,260
"The Only Assassin in this City
is Jake Peralta

401
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,840
Because He Just Killed
This Case."

402
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,060
- I don't know if we want
to make it seem

403
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,140
like I'm the assassin.

404
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,270
- Yeah, good thinking.

405
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,580
- How about this,
"Hero Cop Saves City,

406
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,370
"Pitt, Clooney Circling
To Play Him In Biopic."

407
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,980
- Hunks!
- I have a headline.

408
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,280
"Pitt, Clooney Laugh
At Jake Peralta

409
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,840
For Arresting the Wrong Man."

410
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,420
- Well, I don't know if they
would laugh at me for saving—

411
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,720
what, did you just say
I got the wrong man?

412
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,680
- What do you mean
we got the wrong man?

413
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,940
What are you talking about?

414
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,430
- You know how you sent
Debbie and me off

415
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,510
on a wild goose chase?
- Oh, so you figured that out?

416
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,810
- Well, Debbie did.
She's quite the detective.

417
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,130
- Oh, I'm really not.

418
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,470
I'm just always being given
meaningless tasks

419
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,080
and I'm not complaining.

420
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,030
- So what, you're just saying
we have the wrong guy now,

421
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,860
because you're upset
about the fake lead?

422
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,600
- No, I'm saying you have
the wrong guy because you do.

423
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,950
When I realized your lead
was nothing but hooey,

424
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,870
I went back to re-interview the
hot dog man, but he was gone.

425
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,660
And why was that?
Debbie, tell 'em!

426
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,220
- Oh, no, I don't want
to be a part of this.

427
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,140
- Because the hot dog man
is the shooter.

428
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,960
- What?
That seems like a reach.

429
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,400
- Sometimes, when you reach,
you grab the truth.

430
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,850
- Sorry, Jake,
he turned it around on me.

431
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,150
- Come on!

432
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,490
- The hot dog man
gave a false statement

433
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,810
to throw us off the scent
and then vanished

434
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,630
while we were off
looking for the wrong guy.

435
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,890
Face it, you're no Manhunter.

436
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,680
If anything,
you're a Wrong Manhunter.

437
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,850
How dare you.

438
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,210
You know what?
This is crazy.

439
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,640
You're just making up a solve

440
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,460
because you can't stand
the fact that you got demoted.

441
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,860
You've been trying to hijack
this case all day.

442
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,160
- I was only trying to help.

443
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,340
If I'm such a headache,

444
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,990
then why didn't
you reassign me?

445
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,780
- Because I felt sorry for you.

446
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,430
- I told you to treat me
like any uniformed officer.

447
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,700
It's not my fault

448
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,870
that you don't know
how to give an order!

449
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,130
- Okay, fine.
Here's one.

450
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,050
We're lifting the lockdown,
go pick up cones.

451
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,700
- Ooh, I love cone duty!
- Debbie, can it!

452
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,140
We have the wrong guy.

453
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,310
You cannot lift the lockdown.

454
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,710
- Go pick up cones,
that's an order.

455
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,880
- No!

456
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,310
- Fine,
then you're off the case!

457
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,980
- Good.

458
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,460
- Do I still get to
pick up cones?

459
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,200
both: No!

460
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,290
- Amy, stop.
You've had enough water.

461
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,720
I can hear it sloshing around
inside you.

462
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,850
- I know,
but I still can't pee!

463
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,940
I'm too stressed.

464
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,980
- You need to calm down.

465
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,030
You know what helps me relax?

466
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,290
- Kicking stuff?
- Absolutely.

467
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,040
So, what or who
do you wanna kick?

468
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,820
That guy looks pretty kickable.
Hey!

469
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,390
- I'm not kicking anybody,
okay?

470
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,910
I just need, like,
some calming noises.

471
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,860
- Okay, close your eyes.

472
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,570
- Okay.

473
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,920
- Glub, glub, glub.

474
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,920
- What is that?

475
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,050
- It's a babbling brook.

476
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,750
Glub, glub, glub.

477
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,970
- You know what?
It's pretty good.

478
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,620
- Thank you.
Everybody, shut up!

479
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,190
Glub, glub, glub,
glub, glub, glub.

480
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,840
- Why is the tent so quiet?

481
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,750
Is everybody
talking about me now?

482
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,070
- Nobody is talking about you.

483
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,070
- Sure.

484
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,590
Terry walks into a tent

485
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,240
and everybody just happens
to stop talking

486
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,240
at the same damn time?

487
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,990
You are gaslighting me
just like my daughters!

488
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,640
- Terry, I think
you're being paranoid.

489
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,850
- I'm not paranoid!

490
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,080
I put a recording device
in my girls' room.

491
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,730
- You planted a bug
in your daughters' room?

492
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,160
- I do what I have to do.

493
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,090
They said I look like
a giant triangle!

494
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,260
- Is that an insult?
- I don't know!

495
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,700
But they were laughing
like it was,

496
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,830
and it hurt just the same!

497
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,140
Don't have kids!

498
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,090
- Well, that ruined everything.

499
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,750
- I know we got
kicked off the case,

500
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,450
but there is good news.

501
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,800
I unlocked a new accessory
for my Foot Friend avatar:

502
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,890
a sandal!

503
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,150
- Debbie, wait.
Change of plans.

504
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,980
We're not going back
to the precinct.

505
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,760
- Are we gonna go rogue
and pick up cones?

506
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,500
- Oh, we're going way more
rogue than picking up cones.

507
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,190
Listen,
it's unlikely our shooter

508
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,030
had his own hot dog cart—
where'd he get it from?

509
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,290
- Please don't make me
help you with this.

510
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,160
- My guess is
the food cart garage

511
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,110
just two blocks away
from our crime scene,

512
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,340
or, shall I say, 238 steps.

513
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,080
- Don't tempt me with steps.

514
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,810
- This is a defining moment
for you.

515
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,430
You can either obey orders
for the rest of your life

516
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,340
and make no impact
on the world, or stand up!

517
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,340
And solve this case with me.

518
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,970
- Is there a third option?

519
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,300
- Nervously tag along.
- Great.

520
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,310
I choose
the nervously tag along option.

521
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,540
- Okay, the reporters are all
set for your press conference.

522
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,670
It's your big moment,
are you excited?

523
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,840
- No.
- Oh.

524
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,180
Are you worried
about your voice cracking?

525
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,530
Do you want me to help you
warm up your throat?

526
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,800
- What would that entail?
- I'll just show you.

527
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,230
- Don't show me, tell me.

528
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,800
- I blow hot air into my hands
and I stroke your neck.

529
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,240
- That's not gonna happen,
and it's not why I'm stressed.

530
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,540
I think Holt got into my head.

531
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,160
We might have to delay
the press conference.

532
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,420
- But this is the moment
we've been waiting for.

533
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,630
My dad's driving home early

534
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,770
from his brother's funeral
to watch it live.

535
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,240
- Wait, he's doing what?

536
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,810
- If you want me to put it
in a better context, I can't.

537
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,130
This was very important to him.

538
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,740
- Holt is a great cop,

539
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,300
and I know the demotion's
driving him crazy,

540
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,300
but his gut is usually right.

541
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,040
I think we need to find
that hot dog cart guy.

542
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,180
- Okay, fine.

543
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,180
But who do we know
that could find us

544
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,880
a random New York hot dog guy?

545
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,180
- ♪ Hey

546
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,920
♪ Hey!

547
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,230
♪ Hey!

548
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,280
- So, you need a little help
from the Weiner Warriors.

549
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,500
- Well, I hate that.

550
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,330
Just tell us what you know,
please?

551
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,940
- There's Lou's Dogs,
he serves 'em up real plump.

552
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,370
- Big Mike's does
two dogs per bun.

553
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,020
- Hank's Franks—
great mustard selection.

554
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,070
- Vicki's Vegan?

555
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,720
I'd rather eat.

556
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,800
- Charlie does an al dente dog,
it's got a really nice chew.

557
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,500
- Johnny Arkansas serves it
Little Rock style,

558
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,080
although he can serve it
Razorback-style.

559
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,080
- Okay, enough, enough!

560
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,300
We don't have time for this!

561
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,390
Just tell us who has a cart
at 6th and 11th.

562
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,260
- Oh, there are no
hot dog carts there.

563
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,820
- What?
Never?

564
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,160
- No way.
- Not a chance!

565
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,730
- Zoning issue.
Forget about it, Jake.

566
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,830
It's Hungertown.

567
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,660
- Oh my God, Holt was right.

568
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
We have to call him.

569
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,570
Officer Holt?

570
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,220
Officer Holt, do you copy?

571
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,840
- Okay, cop.
Turn it off.

572
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,010
- Nice try.

573
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,620
My partner doesn't
follow orders.

574
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,970
- Debbie, you're misreading
the situation.

575
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,280
- Oh.
I'm so sorry.

576
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,840
We both—
both follow orders.

577
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,940
- So you were the shooter,
just like I said.

578
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,460
And the man in the hoodie

579
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,460
was just some random bystander
on whom you tried to pin it!

580
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,240
- No, he was in on it too.

581
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,420
- Oh.

582
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,890
Well, I'm still half right.

583
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,560
- Sure.
Is that important to you?

584
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,850
- Very.
- I'm gonna die.

585
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,340
I'm gonna die before
I ever got to find

586
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,520
my twin sister's killer.

587
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,000
- What?

588
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,330
- That's the reason
I joined the force, remember?

589
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,340
To find the man
who murdered my twin sister.

590
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,740
That's my whole story!

591
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,220
- Debbie, there's no way
you told me that.

592
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,400
Nothing's working!

593
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,050
- Maybe you just need to laugh.

594
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,440
Here, look at this video of a
man being trampled by a moose.

595
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,100
- Dear Lord, that's horrifying!

596
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,930
I know, it's hilarious.

597
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,840
- What are you laughing at?
Is that a video of me?

598
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
Oh, no, is it that time

599
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,630
Terry fell off a Lime scooter?

600
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,850
- Why would any of us
have that footage?

601
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,370
- Don't skirt the question!

602
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,720
I want to know what I'm
falling off of in that video.

603
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,940
- Stop it, Terry, okay?

604
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,980
We haven't been
talking about you!

605
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,630
Oh. Kicking.

606
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,860
I think kicking's working.

607
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,810
- Told you.
Go with it.

608
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,150
Keep kicking that can.

609
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,950
It worked, I have to pee!
I finally have to pee!

610
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,520
- Wait, this is about you
having to pee?

611
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,260
both: Yes!
- Wow.

612
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,960
I guess I owe you guys
an apology.

613
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,440
I may have been bringing
some things from home

614
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,920
into the workplace.

615
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,090
- Yeah, that was clear
from the start, okay?

616
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,530
Now, move,
I need to find a bathroom.

617
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,790
- Stop, we have an emergency!

618
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,960
Everybody stop
what you're about to do.

619
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,480
- Yeah, but I gotta pee
really bad.

620
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,320
- Well, hold it, Amy.
Holt's not answering his radio.

621
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,580
I think he and Debbie
might be in trouble.

622
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,840
- It's just us, man,
you don't have to pretend

623
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,320
to care about Debbie.

624
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,410
- Rosa!
- What?

625
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,890
We barely know her
and she's annoying.

626
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,060
She's always trying to get
people to be friends with her

627
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,310
on that weird app
for pedicures.

628
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,270
- It's a pedometer app.
It's a pedometer app!

629
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,620
We can use the social features
to track her!

630
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,800
It's $80.

631
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,810
Uh, Boyle,
you should download it,

632
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,030
you get better service here.

633
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,030
- Smart!

634
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,640
And I'll upgrade
to ad-free too.

635
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,990
- Smart.
- Okay, let's move!

636
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,380
- Sweet!
We're running, okay.

637
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,730
- If I die,
will you look after my cat?

638
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,520
- I'm really more
of a dog person.

639
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,520
- I understand.

640
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,380
- NYPD, nobody move!
- You're surrounded!

641
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,780
Don't do anything stupid.

642
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,340
- Looks like we got
ourselves a standoff.

643
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,830
- Fine by us, we got
all the time in the world.

644
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,350
- What?
Uh-uh!

645
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,430
I gotta pee!

646
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,490
- Perp secured.

647
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,050
- Great, okay, cool!

648
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,480
I gotta go!
You guys are good, right?

649
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,190
Bye!

650
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,620
- Thanks for saving us,
Peralta.

651
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,920
- Thank Debbie, we tracked you
using her pedometer app.

652
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,850
- Oh, my goodness, I helped!

653
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,500
And I got four new
Foot Friend requests!

654
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,240
What a day, guys!

655
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,670
- Detective.

656
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,460
I believe I owe you an apology.

657
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
- No, Officer, I owe you one.

658
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,900
- No, I owe you.

659
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,020
- Great, 'cause I hadn't
thought of

660
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,370
what I was gonna
apologize for yet.

661
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,160
- I should not have
disobeyed your order.

662
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,040
I was wrong.

663
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,390
Not about the case, of course,

664
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,520
my hunch was impeccable.

665
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,690
- Interesting apology strategy,

666
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,690
a little heavy on the brags.

667
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,120
- Point is, you were right.

668
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,570
I hijacked the case because
I need to feel respected.

669
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,830
Listen,

670
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,480
it's weird
that I'm your boss now,

671
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,790
and that's not going anywhere,

672
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,180
but no matter
what uniform you wear,

673
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,580
I'm always gonna love you—

674
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,540
I mean, cherish—

675
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,620
I mean, respect.

676
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,790
You said respect, right?
- Yes.

677
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,970
- Yep.

678
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,310
- And I feel the same
about you.

679
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,680
So, do you have
any orders for me, sir?

680
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
- Well, I do actually

681
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,810
still need those cones
picked up.

682
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,940
- We're on it.

683
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,240
- We got cone duty?

684
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,380
Yes!

685
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,950
Best birthday yet.

686
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,990
- It's your birthday?

687
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,430
- Hey, so...

688
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,300
today was pretty intense.

689
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,000
- You mean
catching the shooter?

690
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,430
I know, it's a great story.

691
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,770
I just hope Pitt
can get in good enough shape

692
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,730
to play me in the movie,
you know?

693
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,090
- Mm, yeah.

694
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,010
Um, also,
something else happened.

695
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,390
I thought I might be pregnant.

696
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,010
- Really?
- Yeah.

697
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,310
I'm not, I got my period.

698
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,050
And I took a pregnancy test,
but it didn't work

699
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,270
because I drank
11 gallons of water.

700
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,090
- Told you
water was bad for you.

701
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,790
- That's not the takeaway.
- You're absolutely right.

702
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,670
How are you, how do you feel?
Are you okay?

703
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,720
- I mean,
I was really stressed.

704
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,420
This wasn't our plan,
and we agreed we'd wait a year

705
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,240
and there's so much
to do first,

706
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,450
and it would've been crazy,
right?

707
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,760
- Yeah, it would've been.

708
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,770
- Okay.

709
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,510
- But...

710
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,380
also might've been...

711
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,850
kinda cool.

712
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,590
- Honestly?

713
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,330
I was secretly bummed when
the test came back negative.

714
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,730
- Should we just start trying?

715
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,350
- Seriously?

716
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,790
- Yeah, seriously.

717
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,750
- Okay.
Yeah.

718
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,540
- Oh, wait!
It's after 11.

719
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,630
- My interview!

720
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,930
It's supposed to be
on the news.

721
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,970
- An incredible conclusion

722
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,110
to a terrifying day,

723
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,890
and we were able
to get a comment

724
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,490
from the men who helped
solve this case.

725
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,360
- They call us
the Weiner Warriors.

726
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,280
- No!

727
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,420
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

728
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,370
- Fremulon.
