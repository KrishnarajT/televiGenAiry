1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,030
- And I believe
that's all I've got.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:07,940
Oh, wait,
there's one more thing.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,290
Peralta gave me a note
before the meeting.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,340
Ugh, the penmanship is horrid,
but I think it says,

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,430
"Ask if anyone has
an anal mint."

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,430
- It's announcements,
and we do.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,860
- Wow, what an entrance.

8
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,780
- Amy and I have
some big news to share.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,960
- I'm pregnant.
- We're pregnant!

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,780
- Wow, I can't believe it.
- Congratulations.

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,050
- What a surprise.

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,610
- What the hell?
I thought you guys would be

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,750
more excited than that.
Charles, you didn't even faint.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,100
- I'm so sorry, I'll try.

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,620
It's not working.
Somebody choke me.

16
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,670
- On it.
- Rosa.

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,580
Sorry, we're so happy for you,

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,840
but we also maybe,
kind of already knew.

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,680
I mean, you didn't do
the best job of hiding it.

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,590
Why have you been carrying
that box around so much?

21
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,980
- I just love this box.

22
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,460
- Why are you reading
that newspaper?

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,330
It's two days old.
- I just love this issue.

24
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,820
- Hey, why are you wearing
that hazmat suit?

25
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,120
- I just love this look.

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,950
- Okay, fine, so you all
knew we were pregnant.

27
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,690
Good for you.
But I bet you didn't figure out

28
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,520
that we're having twins.

29
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,870
- No, not really.
It's one baby.

30
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,610
I just needed
to see Charles faint.

31
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,980
- Aw, Jake.

32
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,680
I am excited that
you're having a kid.

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,370
- Thank you, Dad.
Oh, and hey, if you're free

34
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,930
next Friday, we're having
a sex reveal party.

35
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,680
- Well, I went to one
of those in Amsterdam.

36
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,680
I would not invite relatives.

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,330
- What?
No, no, no.

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,470
It's a party where we find out
the biological sex of the baby

39
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,600
in a surprising way.

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,900
- You better hope
you're having a girl.

41
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,520
Peralta fathers do not
get along with sons.

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,950
- What?
That's not true.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,700
I mean, look at us.
We're doing better than ever.

44
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,610
This year, you even remembered
my birthday month.

45
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,430
- Things are good now,
but honestly,

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,090
it's probably just a blip.
- Well, that's fun to hear.

47
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,610
- Well, that's just
the way it is.

48
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,920
It's the family curse.

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,180
I haven't talked to my father
since you were 10.

50
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,620
His dad abandoned him
at the World's Fair.

51
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,190
His dad fled to America after
drowning his dad in a well.

52
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,540
- Oh, my God.

53
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,060
Okay, so yes, fine,
there's a bit of a trend.

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,890
But we're not cursed.
You and I are good.

55
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,850
I bet you could even
fix things up with your dad.

56
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,280
- The Admiral?

57
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,160
I always hoped that I could
reconcile things with him

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,900
one day, but he's not
going to let that happen.

59
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,900
What can I tell you?
We're not meant to have sons.

60
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,900
There's a demon in our genes.

61
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,610
- Title of your sex tape.
- No, the title of my sex tape

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,080
is "Cockpit Larry and
the Mile High Stewardae."

63
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,220
- What?
- "Stewardae."

64
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,220
It's plural
for stewardess.

65
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,220
- Okay.

66
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,910
- ADA Kurm, how are you?

67
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,570
- Do you want the real answer,
about how my wife's leaving me,

68
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,920
or do you just want me to say,
"Good, how are you?"

69
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,400
- The latter?

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,140
- Good, how are you?
- We're fine; why are you here?

71
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,970
- You know that Carroll Street
Brownstone B&E?

72
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,010
- Yeah, broken windows,
swiped an old TV.

73
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,800
- The house belongs
to a friend of the mayor's.

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,240
- Oh, I didn't realize
the case was a priority.

75
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,670
I'll check into it right away.

76
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,460
- Great, call me as soon as
you have anything.

77
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,890
- Yeah.
Will do.

78
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,900
Oh, God, what a nightmare.

79
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,940
- Agreed.
Dude's a mess.

80
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,940
You know he's only 24?

81
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,460
- No, the Carroll Street case.

82
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,600
I didn't realize that the mayor
was interested in it,

83
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,210
and I think I did
something bad.

84
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,730
- You gave Hitchcock and Scully
an important case?

85
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,520
both:

86
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,130
- Okay, here's the cake.

87
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,650
If it's pink on the inside,
it's a girl.

88
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,820
And if it's blue, it's a boy.

89
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,480
- And why do you seem
so bummed by that?

90
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,610
- Because I still think you
should have done the pig roast,

91
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,100
where we start eating it
from the snout,

92
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,100
and discover the baby's sex
when we get to the genitals.

93
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,710
- Yeah, you know,
Amy wanted to do that too,

94
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,840
but I just don't see it.
- Hmm.

95
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,010
- I'm getting a text.

96
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,010
Ooh.
"I will see you soon, sir."

97
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,630
Guess who that was.
- Elton John.

98
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,760
- What?

99
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,930
- You said "sir,"
and that's on you.

100
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,540
- No, it was my grandfather,
the Admiral.

101
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,840
- Whoa, you tracked him down?

102
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,110
- Yup, he's on his way
to my apartment right now.

103
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm going to fix
his relationship with my dad.

104
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,160
It's going to be
very emotional.

105
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,460
- It's going to be so dramatic.
You should be

106
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,810
producing for Ellen.
- Do you really think so?

107
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,240
'Cause I actually have
another idea for a segment

108
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,030
where Ellen turns your home
into a haunted house.

109
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,860
I call it "Extreme Makeover:
Bone Edition."

110
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,300
But you know, I...
I don't have to do it.

111
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,950
I like being a cop.
- And you're so good at it.

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,310
- Yeah, okay, I'm going
to go meet my grandpa.

113
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,520
- Yup.

114
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,170
- Ooh, fun!
Terry's playing the flute.

115
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,740
- At work.
Who are you, William Wonka?

116
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,620
- No, this is police business.

117
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,010
The flautist
for the NYPD band retired,

118
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,010
and I'm going to audition
to take her spot.

119
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,670
Captain Holt, you love music.
Can you give me some pointers?

120
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,580
- I'd rather not.
The music they play is dreck.

121
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,110
Last month,
they performed Sousa

122
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,670
at a fallen officer's funeral.

123
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,980
And the people were
so appalled, they cried.

124
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,540
- Or they were crying
for the deceased.

125
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,770
- No, she was very unpopular.

126
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,600
The band made them cry.

127
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,340
- Suffice it to say,
I don't respect what they do,

128
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,770
so I wouldn't be
the right teacher.

129
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,550
I'm sorry.

130
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,990
- Hey, Grandpa.

131
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,220
- Attention!
- Oh.

132
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
- At ease.
Just pulling your leg.

133
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,690
I'm your grandfather,
not your commanding officer.

134
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,700
Now, come on.
- Aw.

135
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,220
- Give me a handshake.
- Okay.

136
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,440
Right, come on in.

137
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,620
- Wow, it's really been
quite a while, huh?

138
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,880
- Yeah.
- Are you still watching

139
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,840
those cartoons
about the karate lizards?

140
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,010
- The "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles"?

141
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,060
I am.
There was recently a reboot.

142
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,280
They did
some interesting things

143
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,890
with Splinter
and Krang's backstories.

144
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,280
Anyways, I'm an adult now.
How are you?

145
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,930
- Oh, me?
Well, I guess I'm...

146
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,900
- Grandpa?
- What?

147
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,200
- Oh, I was just asking
how you were.

148
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,170
- Oh, sharp as ever.
- Yeah.

149
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,730
- I'm so glad you
reached out to me.

150
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,030
- Same, you know, now that
I'm having a baby of my own,

151
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,780
I've started to realize
how important

152
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,080
father/son/grandfather
relationships really are.

153
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,000
Which reminds me,
my dad is also coming.

154
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,080
- He is?

155
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,390
I'm surprised
he wanted to see me.

156
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,830
- Well, he doesn't exactly
know you're here.

157
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,090
I thought it might be cool
to surprise both of you.

158
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,270
- You know who else
thought surprises were cool?

159
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,710
Admiral Yamamoto, and we all
know what happened then, huh?

160
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,100
- We do?
- Pearl Harbor.

161
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,920
- Pearl Harbor, right.
Some surprises can be bad.

162
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,060
But this one's not gonna be.
This one's gonna be good,

163
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
just like...
- The Battle of Midway.

164
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,630
- The Bimble of Durbay.
Yup.

165
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,720
We both said the same
thing at the same time.

166
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,020
Oh, that's my Dad.

167
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,070
This is going to be amazing.

168
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,110
- Hey, Jakey.
- Roger Peralta.

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,770
Prepare to hug and cry.

170
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,160
This is your father.

171
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,160
- Dad, you son of a bitch.

172
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,170
- Uh-oh.
Ow!

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,260
I can't believe you hit me.

174
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,520
- I'm sorry.

175
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,430
- My face is throbbing.
Hey, "Dino Bites."

176
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,830
- What the hell is
my father doing here?

177
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,570
- You said you wanted
to reconcile.

178
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,260
- I meant after he was dead.

179
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,830
I planned on standing
over his grave

180
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,450
and yelling, "I forgive you."

181
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,450
- Well, you may get the chance
sooner than you think.

182
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,360
He keeps trailing off
and staring into space.

183
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,710
That's his old trick.

184
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,620
Whenever he doesn't want
to talk about something,

185
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,280
he does that.
The old bastard.

186
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,840
- Look, I know
you don't like him,

187
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,500
but can you at least
try to be nice for me?

188
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,640
- Okay.

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,030
I'll be nice.

190
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,290
I wish you were dead,
you lousy son of a bitch!

191
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,770
- You said
you were gonna be nice.

192
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,860
- I lied so I could say
the "son of a bitch" thing.

193
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,340
- Dad!
- Okay.

194
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,820
Your grandson would like us
to make peace.

195
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,730
So, do you apologize
for being the worst father

196
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,740
in the history in the world?
Even worse than fathers

197
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,430
who chain their children
in basements?

198
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,530
- I do not.
- That's on him. I tried.

199
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,570
- I really don't think you did.
- Jake, you don't get it.

200
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,790
He's a heartless jerk.

201
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,140
When I was in high school,
I almost died.

202
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,790
He didn't even visit me
in the hospital.

203
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,710
- Okay, so maybe
start by asking him

204
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,230
to apologize for that.

205
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,580
- No, he should apologize to me
for being in the hospital.

206
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,320
- I'm starting to see
the heartless thing now.

207
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,330
- Growing up, he had a boat.
Meant everything to him.

208
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,420
He named it "Walter,"
after himself.

209
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,940
- She was the child
I never had.

210
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,240
- I was the child you did have.

211
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,680
Anyway, one day I took
Walter Junior out for a spin.

212
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,340
I was trying to impress
one of the lake girls.

213
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,820
Before I met your mom, I was
a bit of a ladies' man.

214
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,820
- Yes, that continued
long after you met my mom.

215
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,820
- He's always been a floozy.
- It was dark.

216
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,520
I crashed into the dock;
I woke up in the hospital.

217
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,820
- How was the girl?
- Flexible.

218
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,520
Man, she could put her leg—
total—

219
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,920
- No, I was—
after the accident.

220
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,310
- Oh, right!
No.

221
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,530
She was totally unhurt,
thank goodness.

222
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,180
But I was in the hospital
for three weeks,

223
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,400
and Admiral Ass
never visited me once.

224
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,750
- I warned you
not to take the boat out.

225
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,450
You make mistakes, you got
to accept the consequences.

226
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,970
- I'm your son!
- And Walter was my daughter.

227
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,760
- Okay, both of you, stop.

228
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,540
You're acting like children.
You know what?

229
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,510
That's it, if you're gonna
act like kids,

230
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,540
then I'm gonna act
like a parent.

231
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,420
- "Cry Hard with a Vengeance"?
- Yeah.

232
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,640
It's Bruce Willis' book
about parenting.

233
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,330
And we're gonna read it.

234
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,560
- I just got another call from
the saddest ADA in the world.

235
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
He's still pissed.
Did Hitchcock and Scully

236
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,080
get anywhere?
- Hard to say.

237
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,340
Their file contains a lot
of non-case related documents.

238
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,520
- A bunch of menus?

239
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,390
- A cease and desist letter
from TJ Maxx.

240
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,740
- Multiple patent submissions

241
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,350
for something called
a "pillow shoe."

242
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,480
- An application
for a time share in Figi.

243
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,270
- You mean Fiji.
- No, Figi with a G.

244
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,660
They're getting scammed.

245
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,630
- Wait.
This is good.

246
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,310
There was a witness
who saw everything.

247
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,580
Identified the thief, they even
described the getaway car down

248
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,410
to a dent in the right bumper.
We're golden.

249
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,500
- Yeah, but Hitchcock
and Scully forgot to write down

250
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,370
the witness' name
or contact info.

251
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,800
- What?
No, that's insane.

252
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,680
Even they wouldn't
do something that dumb.

253
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,850
- Dumb?
Excuse me.

254
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,250
I don't need this crap.

255
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,860
I could be on the beach
in Figi right now.

256
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,600
- If we go to court,
we're gonna need

257
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,860
the witness to testify.

258
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,990
But now, we have no way
of contacting him.

259
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,690
So there's no case.

260
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,390
How could you not take down
the witness' contact info?

261
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,350
- Well, unlike you dorks,
we don't do everything

262
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,910
"by the book."
- We play by our own rules.

263
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,920
- And we get results.
- Mm-hmm.

264
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,310
- No!
You don't!

265
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,000
That's why we're here!

266
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,660
- So John McClain's advice
wasn't great,

267
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,790
but I have other books.
This one says

268
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,020
to make sure neither
of you has a full diaper.

269
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,630
Feels like we can skip
that part.

270
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,370
- I wouldn't be so sure.
- Dad, come on, all right?

271
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,020
How about this?

272
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,280
Dad, just name one happy memory
that you have with Grandpa.

273
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,590
And don't say the memory you're
going to have at his funeral.

274
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,890
- All right, when I was eight,
he was on shore leave,

275
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,940
and we played catch
in the yard, and that was fun.

276
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,820
- Hey, there you go.
That was great.

277
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,650
And Grandpa, is there a happy
memory you want to share?

278
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,780
- Well, can I pick
the catch thing too?

279
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,080
- Yeah, sure.
- 'Cause that was really

280
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,050
a nice time.
While we were playing,

281
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,910
the neighbor kid
fell off his bike.

282
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,480
- Yeah, he broke his arm.
- You could see the bone.

283
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,000
Do you remember when we went

284
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,490
skiing, and the guy fell off
the lift and busted his leg?

285
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,050
- And you could see the bone.
- It was just, like,

286
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,090
sticking right out of the skin,
and he's, like, screaming.

287
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,450
We were laughing.
- Oh, oh, it was beautiful.

288
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,930
- God, I hope
somebody found him.

289
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,750
- Okay, well, you guys
are both monsters,

290
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,060
but this is going great.

291
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,630
- Yes, yes.

292
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,980
- I know you're being positive,

293
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,500
but I could use
some honest criticism.

294
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,030
- Terry, I'd love
to help, but...

295
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,690
Follow me.

296
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,990
- Hello.

297
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,900
You caught me stretching.
I've been doing this

298
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,520
and nothing else for the
last half hour continuously.

299
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,950
- I saw you watching Terry.

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,520
You were finger conducting.

301
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,610
- Fine.

302
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

303
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,000
I may have overstated
my contempt for the music

304
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,750
they play so that I wouldn't
have to help Jeffords.

305
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,970
- Oh, no, am I so bad,
I can't be helped?

306
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,450
Aw, man, I wanted to play
in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

307
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,970
Terry loves being
in and among floats.

308
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,450
- You're not bad.
You're maybe even...

309
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,360
Good.
But to make you great,

310
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,540
I'd have to break you down
to nothing.

311
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,890
It would ruin our friendship.
- I can handle criticism.

312
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,680
My daughters criticize me
all the time.

313
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,900
They're so mean now.
Please help me, sir, please!

314
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,990
- Okay.

315
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,770
Give me your flute.

316
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,590
Wrong!
First rule:

317
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,990
never give anyone your flute.

318
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,520
- Hey, babe, how's it going?
- Amazingly well.

319
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,390
My dad and my grandpa are
actually getting along.

320
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,740
They've been catching up
nonstop.

321
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,870
- Aunt Millie?
- Dead.

322
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,040
- Uncle Thomas?
- Dead.

323
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,050
- Aunt Janet?
- Dead.

324
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,050
- Uncle Dean?
- Gay.

325
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,400
- Ooh, good for him.

326
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,880
What about Aunt Lyn?
- Dead.

327
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,880
- Apparently there was a fire
at the family reunion.

328
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,140
Lucky for my Uncle Dean, he
was not welcome at the event.

329
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,140
- Wow. Dark.
- Yeah.

330
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,410
- Well, I'm glad
everything's working out.

331
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,020
Oh, I got to go.
Love you, bye.

332
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,410
- Actually, I got
to go too, so...

333
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,890
- I didn't even think
it was possible to put a cast

334
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,190
on that part of the body.

335
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,070
- That was Amy.
I hung up first.

336
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,980
Looks like things are
still going great in here.

337
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,550
- Yeah, they sure are.
Hey, Dad, toss me a beer.

338
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,950
Bring the heat.

339
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,560
Whoa!
both:

340
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,640
- No, the sex reveal cake!
- Oh.

341
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,870
- Nobody look at the floor!

342
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,470
No one can see
the color of the cake.

343
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,520
- How long are we doing this?
What's the plan?

344
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,610
- I don't know yet!

345
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,390
- Okay, we all heard
the cake splat

346
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,920
on the other side
of the counter,

347
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,400
which means we can probably
assume you can see the color.

348
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,960
- Why does that matter?
- Because the color of the cake

349
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,450
tells us if we're having
a boy or a girl.

350
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,580
- How can that baker tell?

351
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,100
- Because the baker
does the test.

352
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,270
- No, the doctor does the test.
Then the doctor calls

353
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,150
the baker, and the baker
makes the cake.

354
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,150
- Okay, I hate to say this,
but can you start over?

355
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,670
- No, we don't have time.
Just help me fix this.

356
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,060
- You know, it's Roger's fault.

357
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,590
All he had to do
was catch the beer.

358
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,410
- Well, maybe I'd be better
at catch if I played it

359
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,160
more than once growing up.
- Guys, focus up.

360
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,680
We're all getting along,
remember?

361
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,030
Now, we can't see the cake
before Amy, which means we have

362
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,070
to figure out a way to clean
it up without looking at it.

363
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,080
We have to "Birdbox" it.

364
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,430
- And "Birdbox" is the bakery.
- No, "Birdbox" is a movie

365
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,250
where people aren't allowed
to look at things.

366
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,000
Just put on these blindfolds
and help me clean it up.

367
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,260
- I "Birdbox-ed"
the stewardess in Sweden once.

368
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,260
- Dad!

369
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,960
Okay, that should be all of it.

370
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,260
I think it's safe
to take off our blindfolds—

371
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,310
Oh,

372
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,230
No, no!
Oh, God!

373
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,620
What happened?
We were so careful.

374
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,320
Here comes the mop.

375
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,490
- Bag.

376
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,670
- This is hard.
- Yeah.

377
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,450
I could use a beer, you know?

378
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,110
- Oh, oh.
- You okay?

379
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,330
- The cake was blue.

380
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,550
You're having a boy.
It's the curse.

381
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,460
- No.
No, no, no, there's no curse.

382
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,080
Look, we can still fix this.
All we have to do is clean

383
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,380
every inch of this room,
and then bake a gourmet cake.

384
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,340
- No one can do all that
in two hours.

385
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,470
- Wrong, Dad.

386
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,740
There is one who can.

387
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,310
- Hello, fellas.
Let's get to work.

388
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,780
- Oh, hey.
I got something.

389
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,270
There was a security camera by
the Carroll Street brownstone.

390
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,440
- And it got footage
of the perps?

391
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,060
- No, but it caught
Scully and Hitchcock

392
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,450
interviewing the witness.
- All right.

393
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,140
Let's start canvassing
the neighborhood,

394
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,450
see if anybody
recognizes that guy.

395
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,490
- Yeah.

396
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,540
- Wait!

397
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,710
- What the hell?
- Sorry, I didn't want to run,

398
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,500
and that was the only way
to stop the doors.

399
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,060
- It wasn't, and it didn't.
- It worked, we're here.

400
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,760
- Please, don't go looking
for that witness.

401
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,380
- We're just trying
to fix your screw-up.

402
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,510
- We didn't screw up.
The witness gave us his name,

403
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,120
but he asked us not to write it
down because he's undocumented.

404
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,160
- So he's scared to show up
to testify at the courthouse

405
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,690
because he didn't want
to be detained by ICE.

406
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,990
- Damn it.
- You know,

407
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,780
that keeps lots of immigrants
from helping cops.

408
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,470
- Yeah, we know that.
We're just surprised

409
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,130
that you know that.
- That's insulting.

410
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,780
I'm very concerned
with immigration issues.

411
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,790
- And I've dated
my fair share of spicy—

412
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,530
- No!
- Scully said the nice thing.

413
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,400
You don't need
to go past it, Hitchcock.

414
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,100
- Okay, I know you need help
and time is tight,

415
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,710
but I see there is blue cake
on the floor,

416
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,060
and I know what that means,
vis-à-vis the sex of the baby.

417
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,320
So before we do anything,
I'm going to need a minute.

418
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,810
Sorry for all the weeping
and the weird snort noise

419
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,370
I made at the end.
It's genetic.

420
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,760
Now, Jake, grab the mop,
you're on cleanup.

421
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,460
Admiral, you're
making the batter.

422
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,720
Captain, you're on
frosting duty.

423
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,690
- Okay, Amy just texted.

424
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,210
She's gonna be here
any second, so hide that thing.

425
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,770
- The...

426
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,220
Oh.
- Dad, that is so noticeable.

427
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,390
- Nuh-uh, it's awesome.

428
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,740
- All right, everybody,
act normal.

429
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,870
Act normal.

430
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,610
- Hey, guys.

431
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,480
- Hey, welcome home.

432
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,180
I'd like you to meet
my grandpa, Walter.

433
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,610
- It's so nice to meet you.

434
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,400
- Hello, things are
normal here.

435
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,090
- Yeah, everything's
totally normal...

436
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,450
Back here too,
behind the chair.

437
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,230
- Yup, and that was
a normal thing to say.

438
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,580
Are things normal
with you, Amy?

439
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,880
- Sure.
- Cool.

440
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,240
- I'm going to go get ready
for the party.

441
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,500
- Oh, fun.

442
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,410
Oh, my God, I can't believe
we pulled it off.

443
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,940
Charles, we owe it all to you.

444
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,550
- Stop, it was an honor to cook
and clean with all of you.

445
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,680
- Boy, Jake is so lucky
to have you as his butler.

446
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,690
- Oh, he's not—
- Thank you.

447
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,770
- Oh.

448
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,690
- I'm so glad
you're helping me.

449
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,170
Maybe I won't blow it
after all.

450
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,430
- Oh, you'll do
plenty of blowing...

451
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,780
Of that flute.
Now, let's go.

452
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,780
A five, six, seven, eight.

453
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,400
- Stop.

454
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,620
The nod meant start now,
not start one second later.

455
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,360
Again.
Five, six, seven, eight.

456
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
- Stop.

457
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,890
Are you playing "The Muffin
Man" or "The Garbage Man"?

458
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,630
- Huh?
- Do you know the Garbage Man?

459
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,710
Because I do.

460
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,190
Because I'm looking
right at him.

461
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,930
Again.
Five, six, seven, eight.

462
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,460
- ♪ Bum, bum, bum,
badum, bum, bum ♪

463
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,550
Again.

464
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,680
Again.

465
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,340
♪ Bum, bum, bum,
badum, bum, bum ♪

466
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,770
♪ Da, da, da, da

467
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,340
Why did you stop playing,
Garbage Man?

468
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,820
- I need some water.

469
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,640
- What you need to do is
keep practicing, Garbage Man.

470
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,910
- I don't have any more saliva.
- And I don't have any more

471
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,560
time for your excuses,
Garbage Man.

472
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,440
Now play again.
Five, six—

473
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,830
- I don't want
your help anymore!

474
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,220
I'm not a garbage man!
I'm a muffin man!

475
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,880
- Attention, everyone.

476
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,490
Thank you all so much
for coming.

477
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,660
Please gather around.

478
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,190
We're going to cut the cake
and find out

479
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,930
what our baby's whole
downstairs situation is.

480
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,810
- Why the accent?
- I don't know.

481
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,330
I did so bad.
I should have let you talk.

482
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,500
- Yeah, you should have.
- Okay.

483
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,590
- I love you.
- Oh.

484
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,670
- Okay, let's do this.

485
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,500
Here we go.

486
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,900
- All right, we are having a...

487
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,860
Green.

488
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,420
Oh, my God.
What's inside of me?

489
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,860
- No, you just cut a bad slice.
Here, I'll get a good one.

490
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,560
- I guess the bakery
must have messed up.

491
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,910
- What are you talking about?

492
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,780
Roger's the one that
added the food coloring.

493
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,220
- Well, you mixed the batter.

494
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,870
- Wait, did you guys
bake that cake?

495
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,490
- Well, we just,
you could say that...

496
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,880
- Jake?

497
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,530
- Okay, fine.
Yes, we baked it.

498
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm so sorry.
I'll explain everything later.

499
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,760
Dad, please stop
cutting the cake.

500
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,970
- I'm trying to find
a good slice.

501
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,670
- There is no good slice!
You screwed it up!

502
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,190
You're a screw-up!
- Yeah?

503
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,230
Well, if I'm a screw up,
it's 'cause you screwed me up.

504
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,590
You screw-up.
- Screw you.

505
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,590
I'm leaving.
- Wait, wait, no, don't go!

506
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,630
We reversed the curse!

507
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,860
Don't reverse
the curse reverse!

508
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,500
- Actually, Jake,
I'm going too.

509
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,860
- What?
No, why would you go?

510
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,470
- I need to go to the hospital.

511
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,640
I cut my thumb off.

512
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,250
- Again?
- The other one.

513
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,380
all:

514
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,690
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God.

515
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,300
Ah...
Get the "Dino Bites."

516
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,480
- Hey, how are you feeling?
How's the thumb?

517
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,830
- Great, looks perfect.
Like nothing ever happened.

518
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,870
- It's the other thumb, Dad.
- Oh, no, yeah, that looks bad.

519
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,880
- The doctor said it might
take a long time to heal,

520
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,840
and that it might
never be as long again.

521
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,100
- My thumb?
I don't care.

522
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,880
Is my dad here?
- No.

523
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,720
I called him and he said...

524
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,200
How do I put this?

525
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,850
- That I'm a useless screw-up
and he's done with me?

526
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,070
- Yeah, something exactly
like that, verbatim, sure.

527
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,070
Look, I'm really sorry
that I forced this

528
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,720
whole reunion on you.
I think our family might be

529
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,160
cursed, and I'm going
to be a bad dad.

530
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,900
- No, I was wrong.

531
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,080
There's no curse.
My dad is just a selfish dick.

532
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
And I was too.

533
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,090
All the other Peralta dads,
we probably just learned it

534
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,390
from each other.
- Or it's just in our genes.

535
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,170
- No, you proved that wrong.

536
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,960
You care, and you do the work.

537
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,830
You're reading parenting books
before your kid is even born.

538
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,410
You tried to get me
and Dad back together.

539
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,750
Hell, you even fished
my thumb out of the cake.

540
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,970
- Yeah, that was gross.

541
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,320
- You're so excited
about having a kid,

542
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,930
you're having
a sex reveal party.

543
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,490
I never did anything like that,

544
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,110
except that one time
in Amsterdam.

545
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,940
- I really wish you'd stop
bringing that up.

546
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,290
- Jake, you're going
to be a great dad.

547
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,120
And your son's
gonna love you.

548
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,810
- Thanks.

549
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,330
And I think you're going
to make a real good grandpa.

550
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,510
- Hey,

551
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,120
who's got two surgically
reattached thumbs

552
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,510
and is super proud of his son?

553
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,300
- Oh, you don't have to—

554
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,520
- This guy—

555
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,910
- My boss is furious.

556
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
You ruined my 25th birthday.

557
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,100
I want those guys punished.

558
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,920
- Understood.
I'll talk to them right now.

559
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,880
Without that witness,
the DA has nothing.

560
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,440
Kurm is pissed.
- It's true.

561
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,190
He kept calling you guys
the human centipede.

562
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,880
- Because we have
our heads up our asses.

563
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,020
Yes, we've heard that before.
- I never thought I'd say this,

564
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,320
but you guys did
the right thing.

565
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,020
- Unfortunately, Kurm
wants you disciplined.

566
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,280
So effective tomorrow,

567
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,290
you're each getting one week
paid suspension.

568
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,900
- Like vacation?
- You deserve this punishment!

569
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,860
- It's punishment
where you don't have to work.

570
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,990
- And we can go
anywhere we like?

571
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,550
- You can go to hell
for all I care!

572
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,340
- Or to a resort
where you're being scammed.

573
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,470
- Figi.
Good idea.

574
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,510
- Now, get out of my face!

575
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,000
Have fun.

576
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,000
- Next.

577
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,960
- Hi, my name is
Terry Jeffords.

578
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
And I don't know how
this is going to go—

579
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,270
- Wait!

580
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,660
- Sir.

581
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,490
- I'm Captain Raymond Holt
of the 99th precinct,

582
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,230
and I need to tell you
about this man.

583
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,230
Now, the audition piece
he's about to play may not

584
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,060
be technically perfect.
In fact, it may hurt your ears.

585
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,360
You may consider it
an insult to music.

586
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,980
You may whisper to each other,

587
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,240
"'Muffin Man'?
Pssh!

588
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,890
More like Garbage Man."

589
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,540
- Come on.
- But you would be wrong.

590
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,900
This man has
taught me something.

591
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,030
He's taught me that music
is about heart and soul.

592
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,900
It's about perseverance.
Despite everything

593
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,160
I put him through,
he showed up here today.

594
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,650
And you would be a fool
not to put him in your band.

595
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,910
- Thank you, Captain.
Lieutenant?

596
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,170
What instrument do you play?

597
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,470
- The flute.
- You're hired.

598
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,090
- What?
I haven't even played.

599
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,570
- You're the only flute
who auditioned.

600
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,570
Welcome to the band.

601
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,390
- Yes!
I did it!

602
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,090
- Hey.
How's your dad doing?

603
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,580
- Well, the doctor
said he'll be okay,

604
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,400
but his hands are
basically claws now.

605
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,960
I don't know why
they think that's okay.

606
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:56,060
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
the cake was green.

607
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,320
- It's okay.

608
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,970
I'll love our little Shrek
no matter what.

609
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,110
- Oh, my God.
That's right.

610
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,460
You still don't know
the sex of the baby.

611
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,070
With all the craziness,
I almost forgot.

612
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,980
Emphasis on "almost."
- What?

613
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,240
- Well, I got another cake
just for the two of us.

614
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,340
- Jake, that's so sweet.

615
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,110
- Here we go.
- I'm so excited.

616
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,510
It's empty.
There's no cake inside.

617
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,940
- What?
Where'd it go?

618
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,600
- Hey, guys.
Do you have any milk?

619
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,600
We're having a boy?

620
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,130
- We're having a boy!

621
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,260
- Hey, do you have milk or not?

622
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,520
- Jeez.
- God.

623
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,520
- Fremulon.

624
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,570
- Not a doctor.
- Shh!
