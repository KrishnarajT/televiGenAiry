1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,150
It's happening again.

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,540
Rosa, Rosa, Hitchcock fell
asleep in the break room.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,100
I pranked him.
I tied his shoelaces together.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,460
- You're 38 years old,
dude.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,290
- I know, and yet my pranks
still stay so fresh.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,590
It's incredible.

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,320
- You gotta untie his shoes
before he gets hurt.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,020
- Look, seriously?

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,020
- Seriously.
- Fine.

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,850
But what's the worst thing
that could happen?

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,990
- He's being strangled
to death!

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,030
- How?

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,140
- So you still annoyed?
- Yes.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,840
You can't keep saying
"mischief managed"

15
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,290
after we finish sex.

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,550
It's what Harry Potter says

17
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,770
when he needs to clear
the Marauder's Map.

18
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,250
- Obviously, I know that,
but I would prefer

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,380
to keep wizard terms
out of our sex life.

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,760
- But what we're doing
is magical.

21
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,770
We're making a baby.

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,460
- Wait, why'd you stop
the elevator?

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,250
- Look, I know you're excited,
and I am too,

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,610
but I really don't
want to talk

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,740
about us trying to get pregnant
while we're at work.

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,600
You haven't said anything
to Charles, right?

27
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,340
- No, and it's killing me.

28
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,300
I still don't get why you can
tell Rosa but I can't tell him.

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,560
- Rosa's low key.

30
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,650
- Charles can be low key.

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,180
- So how was
everyone's weekend?

32
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,580
- Oh, uh,
we bought a couch.

33
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,710
- Hoo-hoo,
tell me everything!

34
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,320
- Okay, fine,
he can be a bit much.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,880
But don't worry.

36
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,020
I have a plan that guarantees
I'm not gonna tell him.

37
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,710
I've cut him out of my life
completely.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,850
- That doesn't
seem sustainable.

39
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,030
- Yeah, well, so far,
it's working

40
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,380
and it's foolproof,
so—

41
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,590
- Morning!

42
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,800
Jake, can I talk to you
for a second?

43
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,020
- Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,410
- I feel like we haven't
hung out in forever.

45
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,760
- Oh, is that so? I didn't
realize. Is that the case?

46
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,240
- You wanna get a drink
after work tonight?

47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,160
I'm dying to tell you
about Genevieve's new shampoo.

48
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,210
It's edible.

49
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,550
- Oh, wow,
that sounds so fun,

50
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,900
but I actually... can't
because I have plans

51
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,170
with Ron Weasley... berg.
It's a friend of Amy's.

52
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,740
The point is, I'm unavailable
for a very real reason.

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,820
- Jake!

54
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,040
- Oh, my God, is that...
- Boyle!

55
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,230
- It does sound like...

56
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,450
It's me, Adrian Pimento.

57
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,580
- Yeah, we know.

58
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,800
Hi, Adrian.
How are you?

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,450
- Very bad, someone's
trying to kill me.

60
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,190
- Before we wrap up
this briefing,

61
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,320
I wanted to give
a few shout-outs.

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,400
Diaz, great job on that B&E.

63
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,100
You are a good cop
with a great attitude.

64
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,160
- I don't like this.
- Santiago, when I think

65
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,860
of your CompStat reports,
one word comes to mind: wow.

66
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,690
And that "WOW" is an acronym
for "wow, oh, wow."

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,110
- What is happening?
- He's buttering us up

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,600
before giving us some
devastatingly bad news.

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,120
My God, Jake and Charles
are dead.

70
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,690
- Jake and Charles
are not dead.

71
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,900
It's worse than that.

72
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,640
We have to do
our annual HR seminar

73
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,170
on workplace conflict
tomorrow.

74
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,350
- What? Already?

75
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,140
- I know.
I know.

76
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,480
These seminars are not exactly
our favorite things.

77
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,620
- Question:
if I get shot

78
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,100
in the line of duty,
can I miss it?

79
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,230
- Legally, you still
have to make it up.

80
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,580
- Well, there goes
that plan.

81
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,190
- Sir, it's a seminar
that's too boring for me.

82
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,280
I'm saying no to a seminar.

83
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,110
- Look, it's mandatory,
it's not up for debate,

84
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,410
but we'll get through it

85
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,360
'cause we're the best squad
in the city

86
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,890
with the nicest hair,
the kindest eyes.

87
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,060
- He's buttering us up again,
so more bad news is coming.

88
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,640
- HR said they're
sending a funny guy.

89
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
- No!

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,680
- All I know is, I woke up
in a pool of my own blood

91
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,170
next to a metal chair
that had a dent in it

92
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,520
the same shape as my head.

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,740
- What were you doing
before the attack?

94
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,560
- I was sitting in said
metal chair watching

95
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,900
the season two premiere
of "The Masked Singer."

96
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,990
The Egg had just gone,

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,860
and I'm pretty sure
I know who it is,

98
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,860
Sara Gilbert.

99
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,950
- That doesn't
make any sense.

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
- Are you kidding?

101
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,560
You don't think I know
how Darlene walks?

102
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,040
- No, no, no, no,
I'm sure you do,

103
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,610
it's just "The Masked Singer"
ended four months ago.

104
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,220
I still can't believe
that the Bowl of Ramen

105
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,310
wasn't Dikembe Mutombo.

106
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,320
- Four month—
no, no, no.

107
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,890
I watched this last night.

108
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,850
That doesn't make any—

109
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,670
Where am I?

110
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,670
What is that table?
- Calm down.

111
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,110
You're at the nine-nine,
and you know what a table is.

112
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,630
- I don't remember coming here.
How did I get here?

113
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,600
- Oh, my God.

114
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,460
Pimento has
"Memento" disease.

115
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,990
Your memory
is resetting

116
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,510
like the guy from
the movie "Memento."

117
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,900
- What?
- You guys never saw "Memento"?

118
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,730
It's the guy with
no short-term memory,

119
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,380
you know, Christopher Nolan's
first movie.

120
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,090
- Is it like Dory
from "Finding Dory,"

121
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,440
she keeps forgetting
where she's swimming?

122
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,690
- No, no, it's like—
- Dory, yeah, yeah, yeah!

123
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,570
I'm like the forgetful
little fish.

124
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,180
- Ah.
- Oh, I mean, yeah, it's like

125
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,790
that, but it's also like—
- Just keep swimming!

126
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,620
- That's what Dory says.
- Classic Dory, Jake!

127
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,920
- Ugh, you guys
really ruined

128
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,480
the coolness of this
"Memento" thing.

129
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,930
- Also, Jake, "Following"

130
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,490
is Christopher Nolan's
first movie.

131
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,620
You sound like a grade A
out here.

132
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,060
- What's up, squad?

133
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,930
Hope y'all like condiments
because I got all the sauce.

134
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,200
- Huh?

135
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,810
- I arrested a tween shoplifter
yesterday,

136
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,200
and she was real cool
at talking.

137
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,110
- I love you, Amy, but maybe
slang isn't your thing.

138
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,820
Whatevs.

139
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,550
Check it: I got a copy

140
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,820
of last year's workplace
conflict presentation.

141
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,870
All we have to do
is study the crap out of it,

142
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,520
then we can answer
every question

143
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,170
before that tool from HR
even asks it.

144
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,770
We'll be done in no time.

145
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,780
- So your solution for getting
us out of the boring seminar

146
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,960
is having us memorize
the boring seminar.

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,910
- Exactly.

148
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,790
- It's genius,
and it's fun.

149
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,040
I love committing things
to memory.

150
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,650
- Yeah, I'm out.
I don't do homework.

151
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,260
- You do now.

152
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,960
Get busy, ya flope.
- Flope?

153
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,140
- It means loser, okay?
It's new slang.

154
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,540
People are saying it!
The tween said so!

155
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,010
- It just doesn't
make any sense.

156
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,490
I mean, you love
"The Dark Knight,"

157
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,670
you love "Inception,"

158
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,420
and you haven't even
seen'Memento"?

159
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,810
- Jake, I don't know
what to tell ya.

160
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,290
I spend a lot of time
in jungles, you know.

161
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,990
They don't exactly
get movies like that.

162
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,210
It's usually big blockbusters
like "Finding Dory."

163
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,820
- 486 million domestic.

164
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,170
- When you factor in
international, 1.2 billion.

165
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,610
- Look, Adrian, we don't
have a ton to go off on here.

166
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,770
What else has been
going on in your life?

167
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
- Normal stuff.

168
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,340
Ooh, I got hired as a PI

169
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,130
by the Countess Luann
from "Real Housewives."

170
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,040
I ended up sleeping with her
in a tiny hotel Jacuzzi.

171
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,830
I also microwaved
a watermelon

172
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,000
just to see if
it would explode.

173
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,660
- Okay, this is
immediately unhelpful,

174
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,390
but did
the watermelon explode?

175
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,960
- It just cracked
and got hot.

176
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,670
- Oh.
- Total bust.

177
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,670
- Hey, maybe
one of your PI cases

178
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,840
is the reason
you got attacked.

179
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,660
- I thought of that too,
but I doubt it.

180
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,010
You know, they're all the same,
kinda boring.

181
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,540
It's some redheaded lady wants
me to hack her husband's phone

182
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,640
to see if he's cheating with
a spin instructor named Kendra.

183
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,860
- It seems a little specific

184
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,290
that they would all
be like that, but okay.

185
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,690
- Where is that
coming from?

186
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,170
- Oh, my God,
there's a bomb in my chest!

187
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,810
- What?
- They put a bomb in my chest!

188
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,260
- What do we do?

189
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,600
Wait a second, the sound's
coming from my little watch.

190
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,610
- You just assumed
there was a bomb inside you?

191
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,790
- It says, "Take pill,
right jacket po"--

192
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,750
I've never seen these
before in my life.

193
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,450
- This was filled
three days ago.

194
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,440
This doctor must be
treating you for your...

195
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,230
- "Finding Dory" Disease,

196
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,400
that's what most people call
anterograde amnesia.

197
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,760
both: Just keep swimming.

198
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,630
- Exactly, that's what
I tell my patients,

199
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,070
just keep swimming.

200
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,890
- So what do you think
caused Pimento's memory loss?

201
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,890
- Probably years
of repeated head trauma.

202
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,640
I've been working
as a neurologist

203
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,030
for over two decades,
and I have neverseen a patient

204
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,820
with more traumatic
head injuries.

205
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,990
- Well, doesn't look so bad.

206
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,430
- The red
is the good parts.

207
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,600
- Oh, my God.

208
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Oh, I guess
it does make sense.

209
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,870
Pimento lives pretty hard.

210
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,120
- I locked my keys
in the car again.

211
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,780
I guess I'll have
to smash the window.

212
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,300
- Actually, I got
a hammer in my car.

213
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,520
Come on,
everybody knows

214
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,260
the skull is the hammer
of the body.

215
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,620
- Yeah, that's not true.

216
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,780
- What? Really?

217
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,970
Okay, well,
then this is on me.

218
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,790
- Look, this morning,
Pimento was screaming

219
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,090
about someone
trying to kill him.

220
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,450
Has he said anything
like that to you?

221
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,710
- He has, but I've seen him
every day for weeks,

222
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,230
and I haven't noticed
any new injuries,

223
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,580
but the medication he's on
may be making him paranoid.

224
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,850
- Really? Because he doesn't—

225
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,760
There's a bomb in my chest!

226
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,720
- Right, he does keep
doing that.

227
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,200
- Hey, it was nice of you

228
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,460
to let Pimento crash
at your place last night.

229
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,470
How'd it go?

230
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,510
- Oh, well, he gave Nikolaj

231
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,900
a haircut
while he was asleep,

232
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,370
but no weird memory stuff,
so all in all, major win.

233
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,160
- Great, so it sounds like
he might be getting better.

234
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,950
- Ah, someone's
trying to kill me!

235
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,120
- Oh, boy,
here we go again.

236
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,780
- Ah, gah!
- Pimento, Pimento, Pimento!

237
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,510
Don't worry.
Everything's okay.

238
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,690
You've had
some brain trauma,

239
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,960
and it caused you
to lose your memory.

240
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,610
You're scared
that you're in danger,

241
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,920
but there is no evidence that
anyone is trying to kill you.

242
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,300
You're safe.
- Wait, wait, really?

243
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,310
Whew, okay.

244
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,930
Thank you.

245
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,320
I was really worried, you know,
'cause of this gunshot wound.

246
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,150
- Oh, my God, someone's
trying to kill you!

247
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,720
- What? You just told me
that wasn't the case!

248
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,540
- So there I am, naked,

249
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,710
still holding
the hedge trimmers

250
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,980
when the chauffeur walks in
and I say,

251
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,500
"Guess you caught me
red-handed."

252
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,120
- Because of the blood?
- Yeah, because of the blood!

253
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,120
See, you get it.

254
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,120
- The bullet went through
your friend's shoulder.

255
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,650
He should be fine,
although he does keep asking me

256
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,170
if we do the "Face/Off"
surgery here.

257
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,950
And what'd you tell him?

258
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,340
- That we don't.

259
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,700
Right.

260
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,520
She's hiding something.
- Obviously.

261
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,950
Okay, Adrian, there's very
little evidence to go on,

262
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,050
so we should take a look
at your PI case files.

263
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,440
- Don't have any.

264
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,390
Keep everything right up here
in the old steel—

265
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,450
where am I?

266
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,660
What is this bed?

267
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,960
- And his memory's
resetting.

268
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,190
All right, Adrian,
someone's trying to kill you.

269
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,620
- Uh-huh.
- You have a memory disorder...

270
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,530
- That makes sense.
- Like in the movie "Memento."

271
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,540
- I haven't seen that!
- It's like "Finding Dory."

272
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,060
- Oh, now I know
exactly what's going on.

273
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Thank you, Charles.

274
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,370
- Okay, let's get you dressed

275
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,670
and back to the precinct
where it's safe.

276
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,030
- Okay.

277
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,550
- Oh, Adrian, the back
of your gown's open.

278
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,330
- Don't peek at my tushy.

279
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,890
- Ah. Wait, since when is
your back covered in tattoos?

280
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,330
- It's not,

281
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,380
otherwise I couldn't get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

282
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,980
- Are you Jewish?
- Not yet.

283
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,030
Ooh, I should ask that nurse if
they've got a mohel on staff.

284
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,610
- Wait, maybe you've been
getting tattoos

285
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,260
to help you remember things,
like the guy in "Memento."

286
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,610
- Again, haven't seen it.

287
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,350
- No, the tattoos
could be clues

288
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,350
that you're leaving
for yourself.

289
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,790
Here, we'll step out.

290
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,400
You get undressed and write
down everything you see,

291
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,570
and you're fully naked.
- Hey-oh!

292
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,350
- All right, well, I guess
we're looking at 'em together.

293
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,960
- My name is Brad Portenberg,

294
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,760
and today I'm gonna teach you
about workplace conflict.

295
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,240
So I brought along someone
who's an expert in conflict:

296
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,630
my ex-wife.

297
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,500
Just kidding.

298
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,800
She lives in Vermont
with our kids.

299
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,510
So can anyone tell me
what a stereotype is?

300
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,250
- The Irish are
potato-eating drunks.

301
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,640
- And the gays—
- No, no, no,

302
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,860
what does the word
"stereotype" mean?

303
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,560
- Uh...
- I got this, fellas.

304
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,250
It's a preconceived,
often prejudiced notion

305
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,860
about a group of people.

306
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,770
- Great, and can anyone tell me
what a protected class is?

307
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,740
- A group of people
with a common characteristic

308
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,780
that is legally protected
from employment discrimination.

309
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,950
- And how many protected
classes are there?

310
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,960
- 20.

311
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,350
- Wow.

312
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,260
It seems like
I have myself a star pupil.

313
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,920
- Honey, you have no idea.

314
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,260
- "Extra ranch, no tomato,
no cilantro."

315
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,790
These are just a list
of modifications

316
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,350
on a signature salad
from Panera.

317
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,010
- Okay, this one says,
"Buy toilet paper"

318
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,370
in a truly gigantic font.

319
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,760
I hate to think
of the horrific event

320
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,540
that led to a reminder
of this size.

321
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,100
- This says your bank account
number is 432211378,

322
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,410
then just under that,

323
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,070
"Someone saw this
and stole your money."

324
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,450
- Aw.
- Ew.

325
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,280
This just says,
"Don't trust your D."

326
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,150
- Okay, well,
that's good advice.

327
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,680
My D does get me
in a lot of trouble.

328
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,470
- Are you sure that's what
the D stands for?

329
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,940
- Oh, it's for sure my dong.

330
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,990
It could tell some stories:
Costa Rica in '98, Nam.

331
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,520
- It's coming up.

332
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,130
- Oh, no, there's a bomb
in my chest!

333
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,560
Save yourselves!

334
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,130
- No, no, no, no, it's just
your little watch, okay?

335
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,560
Means it's time for you
to take your pills.

336
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,010
You keep them in
your right coat pocket.

337
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,360
- Oh, okay.

338
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,660
Where's my coat?
- It's down in my car.

339
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,310
- Ah, I'll go get it.
You stay here.

340
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,490
- No, no, no,
your penis is out.

341
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,480
I'll go.
- Okay.

342
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,360
Whew, boy, I love
that little guy, right?

343
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,500
- Yeah.

344
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,060
Oh, my phone's ringing.
Gotta grab it.

345
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,330
It's Amy.
- Aw, Ames!

346
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,370
Put her on FaceTime.

347
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,970
- Wha?
No.

348
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,060
- Come on!
- Hey, what's going on?

349
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,720
- Hey, just checking in.

350
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,330
How's it going with Charles?

351
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,080
I know how hard
this is for you.

352
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,160
Have you told him anything?

353
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,330
- Nope, we're still all good.

354
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,820
He has no idea that we are

355
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,730
growing a Whomping Willow
in your Chamber of Secrets.

356
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,680
- Well, I have to get back
to the seminar.

357
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,420
Also, you've
ruined sex forever.

358
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,470
- Yep, I heard it.

359
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,480
I don't know why
I keep doing it.

360
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,260
I love you. Bye.

361
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,390
- What was all that about?

362
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,130
- Oh, I actually
really can't tell you.

363
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,700
No, wait a minute,
you're the only person

364
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,000
that I can tell because
your brain's broken.

365
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,400
Anything I say,
you'll just forget.

366
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,920
- Well, I guess that's true.
Give it to me.

367
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,310
- Amy and I are trying
to have a baby.

368
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,320
- What?
Jake, that's wonderful.

369
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,710
Come on, bring it in.

370
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,360
- I'd rather not,
but it still feels really nice

371
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,720
to talk to someone
about it finally.

372
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,720
But I'm gonna be a dad.
It's so crazy.

373
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,370
Hey, don't mention this
around Charles.

374
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,360
Where am I?

375
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,710
- Oh, perfect.

376
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,020
- Listen, Denise,
I felt personally attacked

377
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,340
when you included sesame bagels
at the bagel brunch

378
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,730
knowing full well
I'm allergic.

379
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,950
I developed a rash.

380
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,990
- Says you, Ainsley.

381
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,980
I believe food allergies
are a hoax.

382
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,940
Perhaps your rash is from
all that makeup you wear.

383
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,600
This is an office,
not some downtown dancery.

384
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,050
- Okay, great.

385
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,570
Now, in this roleplay, who can
tell me what went wrong?

386
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,350
- Denise should have made
reasonable accommodations

387
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,740
given Ainsley's
medical issue.

388
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,660
Ainsley unnecessarily
heightened the conflict

389
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,610
by assuming that Denise
had a personal vendetta,

390
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,930
and Denise shouldn't
have responded

391
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,800
to Ainsley's complaint
with an ad hominem attack.

392
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,320
- My thoughts exactly.
- I concur.

393
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,280
- Yep.
- Wow.

394
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,150
I'm really disappointed...

395
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,370
that I have nothing
to correct you on.

396
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,850
That was amazing.

397
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,550
I have never had a group finish

398
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,680
this entire seminar
that quickly before.

399
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,990
It reminds me of
a really funny joke about—

400
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,250
- Ha, ha, I'm laughing already.

401
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,120
Great seminar, sad it's over,

402
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,380
but it is, so see ya.

403
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,980
- Actually,
I have good news.

404
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,850
State law requires
that this seminar

405
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,460
be no less than six hours,

406
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,420
so I guess we'll spend
the next two hours

407
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,080
diving into specific conflicts

408
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,310
about this workplace
and solving them.

409
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,830
- But we beat you.

410
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,090
We beat you with study.

411
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,910
- Brad, my funny friend,

412
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,400
we don't need
this training.

413
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,100
We don't have
any workplace conflicts.

414
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,360
- Oh, there's always
conflict somewhere.

415
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,100
Now, it could be something
small, like a pet peeve, or—

416
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,790
- Hitchcock slept with my wife,
Kelly, in 1988!

417
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,360
- So Kelly was his wife,
not his dog.

418
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,890
- Hey, before Charles
gets back,

419
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,420
there's a few more secrets I
want to say out loud to someone

420
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
who will immediately
forget them.

421
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,800
- Give 'em to me.
- In 11th grade,

422
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,800
I told everyone I was
going to a Megadeth concert,

423
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,760
but it was actually Melissa
Etheridge, and I loved it.

424
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,680
Also, one time,
I ate a dog biscuit

425
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,820
just to see
what it tasted like.

426
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,300
- I get it.
They're delicious.

427
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,470
- They're not bad.

428
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,730
- Oh, here comes Charles.

429
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,130
- Hey, man, did you get
Pimento's meds?

430
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,830
- Sure did.
- Aw, thanks, Chuck.

431
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,000
See, this is gonna make me
feel a lot better.

432
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,130
- I grabbed you a water from
the hospital to wash 'em down.

433
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,790
- Aw, thanks, Jake.

434
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,100
You're gonna
make a good dad.

435
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,490
I'm so glad you and Amy
are taking that step.

436
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,970
- What? How did you—

437
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,020
what about
your memory reset?

438
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,750
- You and Amy
are trying to have a baby

439
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,280
and you told Pimento
and not me?

440
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,110
- They've got
a Panera here?

441
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,590
Okay, I love their salads
exactly as they come.

442
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,760
- Actually, you don't.

443
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,890
Thanks, Jakey.

444
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,420
See, you're gonna
make a great dad.

445
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,900
- Stop saying that!

446
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,590
- Hey.

447
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,950
So you wanna talk about
what happened before?

448
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,080
- You mean the "you telling
Pimento and not me

449
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,470
that you're trying
to make a baby" thing?

450
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,250
No, no, I'm totally fine.

451
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,610
Hey, coffee guy, how would you
like be godfather to my son?

452
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,310
Because a position
just opened up.

453
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,000
- Okay, we're talking
about this.

454
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,300
Look, you're being unfair.

455
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,490
There's some things
in my life with Amy

456
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,530
that are just between
her and me,

457
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,840
and I need you
to be okay with that.

458
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,530
- Fine.

459
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,400
You're right.
I get it.

460
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,010
I mean, it's not like
you told anyone else.

461
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,100
- Right.

462
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,750
I mean...

463
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,850
- We told Rosa.

464
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,370
- Rosa, that dud?

465
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,550
Oh, why her and not me?

466
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,200
- Sometimes you can
be a little much.

467
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,640
- A little much?
A little much!

468
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,290
- Yes, a little much.

469
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,900
- Well, maybe, Jake, I have
"Finding Dory" Disease too

470
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,200
because right now,

471
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,380
I can't remember
why we ever were friends!

472
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,550
- Okay, see, once again,
that was a little over the top.

473
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,690
- Excuse me, my godson's dad,
the crazy guy just ran away.

474
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,120
- Oh, my God, he's gone.

475
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,960
Pimento is gone.
- Just like our friendship!

476
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,050
- Come on, Charles.

477
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,570
- Well, I've got
a bean to boil too.

478
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,830
Santiago always tries
to finish my sentences

479
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,170
and frequently gets it wrong.

480
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,220
- I do not,
and I am not wrong.

481
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,540
- You do it all the—
- Time?

482
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,310
- No, I was going to say,
"All the day long."

483
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,800
See? Frequently wrong.

484
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,060
- I dogsat for Scully,
and he never thanked me.

485
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,140
Kelly was a real handful.

486
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,540
- Wait, I'm confused again.

487
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,620
Kelly was a dog?
- There were two Kellys.

488
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,190
You'd know that if you'd
ever listened to my podcast.

489
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,320
- Okay, dude, just relax.

490
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,800
- Don't tell us to relax

491
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,720
just because you're too nice
to have any pet peeves.

492
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,430
- Oh, Terry's got peeves.

493
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,650
Terry hates the way you always
make mouth noises when you eat.

494
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,900
Nom, nom, I'm Rosa.
I'm eating a croissant.

495
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,170
Nom, nom.

496
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,780
- How's this for a mouth noise?
You suck.

497
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,870
- No, you suck!

498
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,570
- As do you, as do you and you!

499
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,830
- Oh, yeah? Well,
you're all a bunch of flopes.

500
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,310
- Flopes?
- This is the flope right here.

501
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,700
- Okay, all right.

502
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,740
Okay, guys,
that is our six hours.

503
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,450
The seminar is over.

504
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,280
I'm really proud of you guys,

505
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,190
lots of good progress
here today.

506
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,570
You're welcome.

507
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,230
- I'm Detective Boyle.
This is my partner, Jake.

508
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,370
You probably think it's weird

509
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,760
that I said partner
and not friend.

510
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,100
- Not at all.
- Well, the point is

511
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,930
that we're strictly
colleagues.

512
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,420
Have you seen this man?

513
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,770
- Yeah, he was here a few
hours ago for a new tattoo.

514
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,900
It was supposed to say,

515
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,890
"Jake and Amy are trying
to have a baby."

516
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,590
- Seriously?
- Aw.

517
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,990
Wait a minute, what do you mean
"supposed to"?

518
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,290
- He jumped out of the chair
before I could finish,

519
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,780
second time
it's happened.

520
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,910
First time, he left
with a tat that said,

521
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,080
"Don't trust your D."

522
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,510
- That wasn't the whole tattoo?
- No.

523
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,960
He wanted it to say,
"Don't trust your doctor."

524
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,520
- Oh, my God.

525
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,130
Pimento's doctor
is trying to kill him.

526
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,570
He must have remembered
something

527
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,780
when he stopped
taking his pills.

528
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,050
The pills are what's messing
with his memory.

529
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,520
- We have to find him
before his doctor does.

530
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,130
- Oh, I know where he's going.
- You do? Where?

531
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,220
- Said he's going
to his doctor.

532
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,620
- Oh.

533
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,360
Thanks.

534
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,460
- Detectives,
good to see you again.

535
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,320
- Oh, I see, the villain
playing it cool

536
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,940
when confronted
by the good guys,

537
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,330
just like Javier Bardem
in "No Country for Old Men."

538
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,030
Do you guys only watch
kids' movies?

539
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,730
- Whatever you're insinuating,
I assure you, you're incorrect.

540
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,120
- Cut the crap, Doc.
We know everything.

541
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,380
- That's right,
your wife hired Pimento as a PI

542
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,940
to find out if you
were cheating on her

543
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,250
with your spin class
instructor, Kendra.

544
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,560
- And you were,

545
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,340
so you silenced Pimento
before he could tell her

546
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,830
by drugging
him to ruin his memory.

547
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,530
Now where is he?
- I haven't see him.

548
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,480
- Oh, please, you're making
this way too easy.

549
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,910
You clearly just glanced
at this door.

550
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,270
- Don't.
He's not in there.

551
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,270
- Oh, really? Because I'm
pretty sure that he...

552
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,390
isn't.

553
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,350
But he clearly was.

554
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,320
- Jake, help!

555
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,760
- Pimento.

556
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,140
- Got him.

557
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,280
Help!

558
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,360
Jake, what's happening?

559
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,630
What is this ledge?

560
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,320
- You must have tried
to escape out the window

561
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,810
and then your
memory reset.

562
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,120
- What?
I don't understand.

563
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,450
Why would
my memory reset?

564
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,150
- It's just like the film...

565
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,330
"Finding Dory."

566
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,470
- Huh?
- "Finding Dory."

567
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,460
- Ah, say no more!

568
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,290
I completely understand!

569
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,870
- Just stay where you are.
I'm gonna come get you.

570
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,170
- Okay.

571
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,470
Should I go over here?

572
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,780
- No, why would you
go over there?

573
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,950
- I don't know!

574
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,700
I just woke up out here!

575
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,700
- Just stay still!

576
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,360
- Ah, I don't know
what to do!

577
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,700
- Okay, all right.
Here I come.

578
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
Here I come.

579
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,270
- Uh, I'm scared
of heights, Jake.

580
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,400
- Yeah, so am I, Adrian.

581
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,840
- This might not be
the time to tell you,

582
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,790
but both my parents died
falling out of lighthouses,

583
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,850
separate incidents.

584
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,240
- Oh, man, I have
so many questions,

585
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,200
but for now,
just follow my lead, okay?

586
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
- Okay.

587
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,320
- Take small
little baby steps,

588
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,420
like this.

589
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,290
- You're not moving!

590
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,900
- I'm not?

591
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,950
Oh, uh-oh.

592
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,040
- Huh, I'm really
scared, Jake.

593
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,430
I'm really scared.
- Yeah, I know,

594
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,040
just try and look at one thing
and focus only on that

595
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,560
until I can get Charles
out here to help.

596
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,990
- Okay, okay.

597
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,180
Ooh, there's a juicy
old person butt in that window.

598
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,220
- Why's it gotta be
juicy and old?

599
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,480
- I don't know,
but I'm grateful for it.

600
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,970
- All right,
just lock in on that.

601
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,100
Hey, Charles, I know
you're still mad at me

602
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,620
for not telling you
Amy and I are trying,

603
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,790
but I could really
use your help.

604
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,190
- That's not all
I'm mad about, Jake.

605
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,100
I'm upset because
you keep blowing me off.

606
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,970
We haven't hung out
in weeks.

607
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,500
We don't talk
on the phone anymore.

608
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,890
I can't remember the last time
we painted pottery together.

609
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,800
Sorry, I know this isn't
the time to talk about this.

610
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,110
- No, no, no, keep going.

611
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,320
It's helping to distract me
from the fact

612
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,980
that I could fall
and instantly die.

613
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,990
- Oh, no, from this height,
it wouldn't be instant.

614
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,380
When you hit the ground,
your ribs would shatter,

615
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,980
puncturing your lungs.

616
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,120
You'd start to drown on
your own blood, gurgling and—

617
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,350
- Okay, Adrian,
I'm being distracted

618
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,470
by Charles right now,
thank you.

619
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
- Okay.

620
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,610
- Here, take—take my hand.

621
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,000
I can guide you guys back.

622
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,340
- Come on, we're a chain.
Here we go.

623
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,260
- Just keep swimming.
- Oh, just keep swimming.

624
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,620
- Just keep swimming.
- Oh, say it, Jake.

625
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,010
Just keep swimming.

626
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,320
- Good.
- Oh!

627
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,620
- Hey, just so you know,

628
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,840
the only reason
that I've been avoiding you

629
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,230
is because I really
wanted to tell you

630
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,400
what me and Amy
have been up to,

631
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,670
and I knew the second
that I saw you,

632
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,670
I would just blurt it out.

633
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,020
I always
tell you everything.

634
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,630
I hated not being able
to say anything.

635
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,020
- Aw, that's so sweet.

636
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,020
Your love for each other
is really wonderful.

637
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,850
Let's hug.
Let's all hug.

638
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,840
- Oh, no, no, no,
we're still on the ledge!

639
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,560
Okay, this sucks.

640
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,390
We never fight,
and then stupid Brad comes in

641
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,870
and turns us
all against each other

642
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,440
and now we're acting
like a bunch of kids.

643
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,520
- Not all kids.

644
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,690
My girls never act like this.

645
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,920
- We may be arguing,

646
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,050
but we're all thinking
the same thing:

647
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,360
Terry talks about
his children too much.

648
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,270
- Do I really?
You all think that?

649
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,880
- Keep a lid on the box,
Pandora.

650
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,880
You won't like what's inside.

651
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,130
- Everybody, shut up.

652
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,870
You're all acting
like a bunch of Ramonas.

653
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,530
- Ramona?
- Yeah, she hated the smell

654
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,800
of her coworker's holiday
candle, so she threw it out.

655
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,400
It was in that thing
that you made us memorize.

656
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,140
- You memorized it?

657
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,060
But you said it was homework
and you don't do homework.

658
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,900
- Yeah, well, you said
to read it, so I read it.

659
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,550
We're a team, ya flope.

660
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,940
- It's catching on.

661
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,280
- Eh, I mean...

662
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,340
- Hey, guys, it's me,
Adrian Pimento.

663
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,430
- Hey, Pimento,
how's it going, bud?

664
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,170
- Pretty good,
I know where I am,

665
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,130
and I know what a table is,
so everything's going great.

666
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,260
- Pretty low bar for greatness,
but all right.

667
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,390
- Hey, how's it been since you
stopped taking those pills?

668
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,820
- Well, thankfully,
my full memory has come back,

669
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,960
even the things
that haunt me.

670
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,980
Hey, Jake, I saw that movie
you keep talking about.

671
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,490
- You watched "Memento"?
And what'd you think?

672
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,940
- It's okay.

673
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,210
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

674
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,300
- Fremulon.
