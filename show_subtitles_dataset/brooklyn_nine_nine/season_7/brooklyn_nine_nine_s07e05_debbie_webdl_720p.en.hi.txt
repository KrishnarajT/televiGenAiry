00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,210
- Oh, i'm not picky.

174
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,650
I don't need light or oxygen.

175
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,560
I'm kind of like
a low-Maintenance plant.

176
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,300
Ooh, like a succulent.
- That's great, debbie.

177
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,690
- My mom always said that—
- But the trunk is closing

178
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,170
On its own, it's definitely
not me slamming it.

179
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,780
- So you guys
are gonna stay here with me?

180
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,660
- Nucci thought we could
help you guard the coke.

181
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,960
- Oh, i can handle it.

182
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm pretty tough.

183
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,650
I take self-Defense
at the women's gym.

184
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,440
Hi-Ya! Hi-Ya!

185
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,490
- Oh, neat. You actually
say the words "hi-Ya,"

186
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,660
Like miss piggy.

187
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,750
- So when's nucci coming
to pick up the coke?

188
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,310
- Uh, could be hours,
could be days.

189
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,570
- Days?
- I don't know.

190
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,320
Nucci just said
to wait by this burner phone.

191
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,750
He said he always works
like that.

192
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,880
- Right, of course.

193
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,750
We have so many inside jokes
about it.

194
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,190
- I can imagine.
He is pretty funny.

195
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,500
He's always like,
"debbie, if you mess this up,

196
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,120
I'm gonna gut you like a fish."

197
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
What? [laughs]

198
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,280
- So he threatened you.

199
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,720
That's why you went dirty.
- No.

200
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,080
He offered me
a million dollars.

201
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,170
I had no choice.

202
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,650
My dad is really sick,
and he needed

203
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,690
This expensive
experimental surgery.

204
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,470
- Ahh.
- What about you guys?

205
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
How did he turn you?
- Well, i've been dirty

206
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,610
Long before nucci
came onto the scene.

207
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,040
I do a ton of coke.

208
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,400
They call me mr. Springtime

209
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,660
Because of how fast
i make the snow disappear.

210
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,610
- Wow.
I've never even had a nickname.

211
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,610
I mean, i guess people
do call me, "hey, lady."

212
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,310
- Right, well, i'm gonna
let the nine-Nine know

213
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,620
We're looking for you,
you know,

214
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,060
So those idiots don't think
we broke you out.

215
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,530
- Ooh, you think
they're idiots?

216
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,530
- Oh, yeah, big time.

217
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,010
I mean, holt's a blowhard,

218
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,670
Jeffords is all brawn,
no brains

219
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
Boyle's a laughing stock,
amy's just the worst.

220
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,540
I mean, she thinks
she so smart and so pretty

221
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,890
And she makes me feel good
about the world

222
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,600
And my place in it, and she—
- [clears throat]

223
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,080
- Smells like [bleep].
We've all smelled her.

224
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,300
Rosa, let's go outside.

225
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,040
Hey, you know that was
undercover jake

226
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,390
Talking in there, right?
- Relax, man.

227
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,780
- So you're not gonna tell amy
what i said.

228
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,700
- Oh, no, i definitely am.
I'm saying relax because

229
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,210
There's no way you can stop me.
- Damn it.

230
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,520
Well, did you at least
text the nine-Nine

231
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,650
And tell 'em we don't know
when the handoff is?

232
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,180
- Yeah, but man,
i don't like this.

233
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,790
We found the drugs. We should
just forget about nucci

234
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,230
And take debbie in.
- What?

235
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,650
Nucci is
the real bad guy, here.

236
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,310
And you heard debbie,
she's only doing this

237
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,610
To get the money
for her dad's surgery.

238
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,450
- There are other ways
to get money.

239
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,410
She could've gone to a bank.
- Right. And she's white.

240
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,800
She definitely would've
gotten approved.

241
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,150
Terrific point.
- That's not what i was saying.

242
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,150
- Ah, we were both
thinking it.

243
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,540
Anyways, it doesn't matter.

244
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,100
Our plan is working.
What are you worried about?

245
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,160
- There's a loose cannon
in there with two machine guns.

246
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,630
- She's not a loose cannon.

247
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,110
I saw her apologize to a chair
after bumping into it.

248
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Trust me, we are not gonna have
any problems with debbie.

249
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,500
- Hey, jake, guess what?
You made cocaine sound so cool,

250
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,550
I decided to try it.

251
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,780
But i didn't wanna overdo it,

252
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,730
So i only did, like,
a tiny, little toot.

253
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,730
Then i didn't feel anything,

254
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,730
So i did, like,
a little bit more,

255
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,000
And i still didn't
feel anything,

256
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,090
So then i did a lot more,
and then i felt it.

257
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,390
Like, i really felt it.

258
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,210
So then i did a couple more,
like, big ass toots.

259
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,700
Why do you guys
keep ducking behind the bed?

260
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,220
- 'cause you keep
pointing those guns at us.

261
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,350
- Oh, my god.
Do not worry about it.

262
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,300
It's only fine.

263
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,700
- We need to find out
how nucci got to debbie.

264
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,840
Fortunately, it turns out

265
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,750
She kept
a fairly comprehensive diary.

266
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,360
- As a power journaler,
i think we can hold off

267
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,700
On using the word
"comprehensive."

268
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,490
Oh, damn, that's comprehensive.

269
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,590
- These are all
just from this year?

270
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,590
- This one is labeled
august 21st.

271
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,460
- "morning." this one
is august 21st "evening."

272
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,200
- This entire diary is about
an episode of "house hunters."

273
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,370
- This is gonna take forever.

274
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,770
- I actually took
a speed reading course.

275
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,850
I tested at 800 wpm.

276
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,330
- That's pathetic.
I tested at 802.

277
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,510
- That's pretty close
to holt's score.

278
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,910
- No, no, 802's incredible.

279
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,480
She pwned me.

280
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,570
I read the entire
urban dictionary

281
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,790
So i could converse with
the other uniformed officers.

282
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,830
Finished i in 47 minutes.

283
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,480
- I've never been so attracted
to a gay man before,

284
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,880
And i dated several in college.

285
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
- Shall we have a read-Off,
santiago?

286
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,180
- We don't have finger guards.
- So we do it raw.

287
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,410
- Okay,
i normally don't encourage

288
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,890
Such childish competitions,

289
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,670
But this might help
things go faster.

290
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,140
My only question is holt,

291
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,280
Are you sure your old ass eyes
are up to the challenge?

292
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,580
- I know you're just trying
to motivate me,

293
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,810
But these old ass eyes

294
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,770
Will be reading your tombstone,
son.

295
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,630
- Oh, i needed more light
in this place.

296
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,820
Now i can finally think,

297
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,340
And the ideas are, like,
flowing out of me.

298
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,600
Okay, what about this one?
It's hamburgers,

299
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,250
But the pickles are coins.

300
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,690
- Still feel bad for her
now that she's a cokehead?

301
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,510
- She's not a cokehead.
She's an innocent girl

302
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,780
In a stressful situation
who did cocaine one time

303
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,910
And will probably
never do it again.

304
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,820
- Whoo!
Guess who just did more coke?

305
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,920
This is my thing now.

306
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,360
[phone beeps]
ooh! Okay.

307
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,780
- Is it nucci?
- Yes.

308
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,740
He wants to know if i can
do the handoff in two hours.

309
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,360
Um, i'm gonna tell him no

310
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,880
Because i'm having so much fun
with my new best friends,

311
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,350
Jake and rosa.
- Ah, no, no, no.

312
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,830
Don't mention us.
You know, because

313
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,840
You're supposed to be working,
not enjoying yourself.

314
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,280
Right, just keep it short.
Say two hours is great.

315
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,230
- That's very smart,
and i'm gonna send him

316
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,760
My favorite gif
of mr. Bean giving a thumbs up.

317
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,250
Oh, mr. Bean.
What a stud.

318
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,860
Hey rosa, what would you do

319
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
If you could do anything
to mr. Bean?

320
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,890
- Nothing.
- Come on, rosa.

321
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,590
Don't be shy.
Say what you would do

322
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,990
To international sex symbol
mr. Bean's body.

323
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,650
- Fine. I would take
a very large glass—

324
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,740
[bleep]

325
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,610
Let himself out.

326
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,600
- I see.
- Wow.

327
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,390
Um, i just have
one quick note.

328
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,880
Mr. Bean never—
[bleep]

329
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,750
Beg for mercy.
- Ah, great note, debbie.

330
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,840
The point is we all think
mr. Bean is sexy as hell

331
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,010
And wish we looked
exactly like him.

332
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,750
- You're closer than you think.
- Hm?

333
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,840
- Oh, hey, rosa,
it's not that

334
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
You're a third wheel
or anything,

335
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,110
It's just that
we're out of ice,

336
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,020
So could you go get us
some more ice, please?

337
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,750
- Hey, well,
this is full of ice, but yeah.

338
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,280
I'll hit up the nine-Nine.
- You've actually been

339
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,290
Texting the nine-Nine a lot,
haven't you?

340
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,680
- Yeah, to make sure
our cover's intact,

341
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,850
And so they don't figure out
that we're dirty.

342
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
- Is that what's
really going on?

343
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,240
'cause i feel like
there's something

344
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,430
You're not telling me.
- I feel like

345
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,910
All that coke
is making you paranoid.

346
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,340
- No, you're paranoid.

347
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,900
Now, don't you dare
take another step.

348
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,910
- [chuckles] okay, debbie,
what are you doing?

349
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,740
- Give me your phone.
- That's it.

350
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,650
Debbie fogle,
you are under arrest.

351
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,640
- What? Oh, my god.

352
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,730
Are you not really dirty?
- Ah—

353
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,600
- No. And i'll be
taking that gun.

354
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,650
- Hi-Ya!
- [grunting]

355
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,620
- Okay so the women's gym
and the cocaine

356
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
Have given debbie super powers.

357
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,960
Cool. Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

358
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,840
- You're making a big mistake,
debbie.

359
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,010
This isn't gonna work.

360
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,540
- I'm such a terrible
judge of character.

361
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,060
I was wrong about rosa,

362
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,240
I missed all the signs
with my cousin jared.

363
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,800
- The sandwich guy.
- What is wrong with me?

364
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,070
- Nothing,
you're just coming down

365
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,760
From the many handfuls of coke
you did.

366
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,420
- Right. I'm so dumb.
I'm such an idiot.

367
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,940
I'm dumb!
I'm dumb!

368
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,080
- Ah, hey, why don't you let me
hold your gun for you,

369
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,950
And then you can hit yourself
in the face with your fist

370
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,430
Like a normal person
having a mental breakdown.

371
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,300
- I can't give you my gun.

372
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,550
You'll probably try
and arrest me.

373
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,210
- Debbie, i'm not like rosa.

374
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,350

379

I thought you said
she stinks like [bleep].

380
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,050
- She does.
- Prove it.

381

macaroni salad.

384

- Okay. I buy it.
I trust you.

385
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,140
- Why'd you do that?
- Rosa probably

386
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,460
Told the nine-Nine
that you're corrupt

387
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,110
And they could use your phone
to track us

388

Also, i know that

get close enough?

497

- There's one way. She clearly
has a thing for you.

498
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,470
- Why do you say that?
Just because

499
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,280
She has a fantasy of us
as a dog couple?

500
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,680
Wait. Yeah, i see it.
That's gonna work.

See, mom. I am with someone.

509

All those psychics were wrong.

- Yes, babe?

the babe thing.

- Great, great, great.

515
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,980
Well, anyways,
i was just gonna say

516
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,370
That, you know, once we're done
with this big score,

517
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,590
We need a place to hide out.

518
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,370
Somewhere where the cops
could never find us.

519
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,800
- Ooh, like epcot.
- Uhh, yes, epcot is great.

520

That's exactly
what i was thinking.

- We can kiss in front of
the eiffel tower,

522
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,110
On the canals of venice,

523
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,080
Oh, in the canada pavilion.

524
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,380
- Yes, but why wait
till the canada pavilion

525
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,200
When we can start right now?

526
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,200
Huh?
- Oh, my god.

527
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,730
This is happening.
- Come here.

What the hell, babe?

531

- Debbie,
what's your plan here?

532
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Talk to me.
- Why? So you can

533
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,960
Just tell me
more beautiful lies?

534
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,660
You think you can
just lick your lips

535
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,270
And make me weak in the knees?
- No.

536
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,180
- Nice try,
but i closed my eyes

537
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,270
So i didn't even see it.

538

- Oh, come on.

539

- Oh. Nucci's on his way.
[laughs]

540
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,240
And i'm about to be rich.

541
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,670
- Debbie, this is bad.

542
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,640
You don't wanna be
an accessory to murder.

543
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,900
- W-What are you talking about?

544
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,030
- What do you think
is gonna happen

545
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,680
When nucci gets here
and finds two cops?

546
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
He's gonna kills us.

547
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,950
- Yeah, i know that.

548
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,250
Um, i've obviously thought
all this through,

549
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,250
And it all is going
according to my plans.

[debris clattering]

551
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,250
I'm sorry,
i just started trembling

552
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,260
And i accidentally—

553
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,120
- Debbie, please,
just put the gun down!

554
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,910
- I just talked to the manager
at the hotel

555
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Where the handoff
was happening.

556
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,220
He said debbie's room
was empty,

557
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,970
And there's no sign
of rosa or jake.

558
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,450
Is there anything
in those diaries

559
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,880
That can help us find 'em?
- Debbie mentioned her mom

560
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,270
A bunch in one of
the ones i read.

561
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
Seems like
she tells her everything.

562
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,760
- Ooh, that's a good lead.

563
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,280
- It is a good lead, isn't it?

564
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,930
Did you hear that,
speed freaks?

565
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,750
- Let's find out all we can
about the mom.

566
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,280
- I'll start reading
right away

567
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,670

572
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,430

- The race.
Slow and steady wins the race.

577
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,960
- Okay, uh, what if i just
tell nucci not to kill you?

578
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,260
You know,
we're business partners,

579
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,040
We make all of our
business decisions together.

580
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,660
- Yep,
we're all gonna die today.

581
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,880
- Debbie, if you just untie us,

582
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,230
We can help you
get out of here.

583
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,750
- Okay, but if i untie you,
you'll arrest me,

584
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,140
And then i'll go to prison
for the rest of my life.

585
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,390
- You'll be in prison anyway.

586

I guarantee you
if anything happens to us,

587
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,230
The nine-Nine
will hunt you down.

- Okay, okay, okay.

589
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,630
Maybe i should surrender.

590
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,330
Uh, but i don't wanna
go to jail.

591
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,980
Okay, i don't know what to do.

592
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,150
Um, mom, help me.

593
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,410
- Now you need my help?

594
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,770
Please, it doesn't matter
what i say.

595
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,940
You're still gonna mess it up.

596
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,320
Just like you messed up
your bangs

597
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,800
When you had to cut
your own hair.

598
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,070
- Yeah, i'm sure that was
a long time ago.

599
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,300
- That was last year.
- I see.

600
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,070
- Or when you got
in a car accident

601
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,690
When your brother
was going to take the bar.

602
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,690
Or when you lost all your money

603
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,990
Investing in that cruise line
for cats.

604
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,430
- Feline cruise line.
- You know what?

605
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,080
You're not my daughter anymore.
- What?

606
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,740
What are you saying?
- You have embarrassed me

607
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,690
And the family
for the last time.

608
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,740
I'm done with you. Good-Bye.
- Shut up, margaret!

609
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,320
Same crap my parents pulled.

610
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,280
Always pointing out my flaws,
never helping

611
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,410
And then bailing
when things got messy.

612
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,320
You know, i was a lot like you.
- You were holed up

613
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
With a ton of cocaine
and a bunch of guns?

614
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,850
- That's my business.
- What?

615
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,370
- I spent years telling myself

616
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,800
That tough love
made me stronger,

617
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,160
But you know what i really wish
they'd done?

618
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,860
- What?
- Been nice to me.

I wish they would've told me
i made a mistake,

620
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,860
But they still loved me

621
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,780
And they would help me
try to figure it out.

622
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,160
Would've saved me
a lot of pain.

Debbie, you have made
some really bad choices today.

Or did you just say all
that stuff so she'd let us go?

Especially since we got nucci
