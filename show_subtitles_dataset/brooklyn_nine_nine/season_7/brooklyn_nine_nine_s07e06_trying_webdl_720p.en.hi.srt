- Thanks, everybody,
for coming out

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,200
to Hitchcock's
divorce party.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,820
- Why is the cake
two men getting married?

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,250
- That's me and Hitchcock.
The boys are back together!

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,420
- This cake
for a gay wedding.

00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,690
The inside is a rainbow.
- Nuh-uh.

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,390
It's my favorite flavor:
all the flavors!

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,350
- I can't believe
Bethany's gone.

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,960
It was so out of the blue.
- Well, not entirely.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,790
I mean, she did have an affair
with her hairdresser,

11
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,470
and you filmed it and
threatened to release the tape,

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,690
and then she said
she didn't care

13
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,220
and put it on the internet
herself,

14
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,480
and then when it
started to make money,

15
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,230
you sued her
for half the profits.

16
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,840
- And then boom, out of
the blue: divorce papers.

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,270
- Aw, buddy, you'll be okay.

18
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,960
- It doesn't feel like it.

19
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,800
My heart is ruined forever.
I'm done with love.

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,410
I'll never find anyone as—

21
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,370
Oh, my God!
Get a load of the can on her!

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,720
See ya dorks,
I'm gonna get some.

27

did you get my
sexy calendar invite?

28

- You mean the one titled
"8:00 pm coitus"?

- Yes, and the one
titled 7:55 foreplay.

You didn't
accept either invite.

31

Oh.
I can start foreplay later.

It's just—this is all feeling

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
a little overscheduled,
you know?

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,760
It might be taking some of
the fun out of making a baby.

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,840
- Oh, okay.
So what are you suggesting?

- That's one Jake Way.
You know?

41
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,990
The Jake Way is a brand.

It encompasses
a whole lifestyle.

what The Jake Way is.

I've been walking the same beat
for the past three weeks.

- I thought you loved tedium.

- I love monotony.
They're very different.

58
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,980
- I'm sorry,
but you know our policy

59
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,410
is that uniformed officers
must walk

60
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,320
the same beat for six months.

61
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,590
It's how they become familiar
with the community they serve.

make an exception for me.

Well, think of it this way:

It's like doing reps at a gym.

Doing something
over and over again

72

- The only muscle
I care to work out is my brain.

- What the hell?
Why do you have that?

95
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,560

and it fell out of her mouth.

- Well, this is perfect.
We can use it to find her.

fitting that tooth

in New York City

fine and I have to go.

for this meeting?

there's a headset.

- How does it feel
to be played like a puppet?

- Okay,
I'm walking into the apartment.

131
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,510
Why did you have me
get $400 out of the ATM?

132
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,680
- Good question.
It's to pay for the Airbnb.

133
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,730
- You're giving them
$400 in cash?

- My guinea pigs.
This lady is Claire.

And this guy
is also named Claire.

and the pet store
won't take them back.

who works in a lab.

I can call and see if they need

156
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,600
any guinea pigs
for their research.

157
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,510
- They are not
science experiments!

158
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,590
They are living creatures

Flip! Flip!

Oh,
I flipped the wrong Claire.

164
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,090
- Stop flipping guinea pigs

165
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,610
and get them out of here!

166
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,220
- I'll make 'em disappear,
Lieutenant.

167
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,790
- Oh!
Don't kill them.

168
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,140
They have so much to live for.

169
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,140
They haven't even
been to Manhattan yet.

170
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,790
- Okay, coast is clear.

I know a safe place
we can hide these guys

Philosopher Albert Camus,

Also, no more video games,

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,840
- Make it a double.

349
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,410
My heart has a hole in it.

350
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,810
I might as well
fill it with booze.

351
00:10:58,850 --> 00:10:59,930
- Same for me.

352
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,420
Except my hole's in my mouth.

353
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,680
- It's you!

354
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,950
My toothless Cinderella!

355
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,430
- Well, that was definitely
technically sex.

356
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,030
- Yep.

357
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,690
Maybe that was the one.

358
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,310
- Not the one.

359
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,570
- [sighs]

360
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,350
- I'm so exhausted.
- Me too.

361
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,430
But the doctor said
that it could take a while.

362
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,300
- I know.
It's just...

363
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,570
we're doing everything right,
and it's still not working.

364
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,970
What kind of perfect person do
you have to be to get pregnant?

365
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,630
- We're having a baby!

366
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,360
- Oh, rot in hell!

367
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,100
- Congratulations, Hitchcock,

368
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,760
it's the first wedding
I've ever been to

369
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,840
with a cover charge.
- It's for our honeymoon.

370
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,150
We're going to Barbados,

371
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,640
and we'll have the island
all to ourselves,

372
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,250
because it's Dengue Fever
season.

373
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,250
- But your wife is pregnant.

374
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,990
- You can't live in fear.

375
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,690
Don't want to spend every
moment worried about Dengue

376
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,820
or black mold
or those weird spots

377
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,520
on the MRI
they found on your brain.

378
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,950
- Hitchcock,
is your brain okay?

379
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,120
- The point is: I don't care.

380
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,300
Also, Anna's family
is from the Old Country

381
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,860
and kind of conservative,

382
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,700
so try not to mention
the baby to them.

383
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,050
- Perfect; I'll just do
what I always do at weddings:

384
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,830
not talk to anyone
I don't know already.

385
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,130
- You're the best, Jake.

386
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,230
That's why you're
the baby's godfather.

387
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,270
- Wait.
I am?

388
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,010
- Ugh.

389
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,130
I can't believe
they're pregnant and we're not.

390
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,610
How did they do it?

391
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,920
- They got drunk and had sex

392
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,190
in a public park
next to a skunk.

393
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,530
Hitchcock sent me
a very long text

394
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,760
with a lot of details in it.

395
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
I think
it was meant for Scully.

396
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,020
- Ugh, the world is officially
upside down.

397
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
- Wait a minute.
Maybe that's it.

398
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,720
We tried getting pregnant
The Jake Way;

399
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,840
we tried The Amy Way.

400
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,280
Maybe it's time we tried it...

401
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,810
The Hitchcock Way.

402
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,630
- What's The Hitchcock Way?

403
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,200
- In every situation,
make the worst possible choice.

404
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,340
- Okay.
What the hell?

405
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,690
Nothing else is working.

406
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,080
Let's try it The Hitchcock Way.

407
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,210
- All right, so first move:
Get hammered.

408
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,350
[grunts]
Drink up.

409
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,700
- Uh, these are someone else's.
There's lipstick on mine.

410
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,350
- Yeah,
there's a cigarette in mine.

411
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,780
But we're doing things The
Hitchcock Way, so bottoms up!

412
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,880
- All right.

413
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,660
- For those of you
that don't know me,

414
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,870
my name is Norm Scully.

415
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,090
Hitchcock is my partner,

416
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,930
and he's also my best friend.

417
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,890
He buys the bear claws I like
when we're on a stakeout

418
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,110
or when we're just
in the office or at home.

419
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,110
I love him.

420
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,630
Anna Rubov,

421
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,370
do you promise
to love and cherish

422
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,230
Michael Hitchcock as
much as I've loved him?

423
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,580
- I do.

424
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,670
- And, Michael Hitchcock,

425
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,250
do you agree to shower Anna

426
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,210
with the same love and kindness
you've shown me

427
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,340
these 30 wonderful years
together?

428
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,300
- I do.
- Dang.

429
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,650
Terry didn't know
this was gonna be so sweet.

430
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,000
- You may now kiss the bride.

431
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,960
[cheers and applause]

432
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,250
- Hey, Rosa, good news.

433
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,860
I just talked to someone

434
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,610
who said he'd take
all the guinea pigs.

435
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,100
- All 600?
Why would he do that?

436
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,920
- I didn't ask.
I just said yes.

437
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,390
Our prayers have been answered!
- Who is this guy?

438
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,180
We gotta check him out,
make sure he's not weird.

439
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,360
- He's just a normal guy
who's a friend of Hitchcock's—

440
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,010
yep, we gotta check him out.

441
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,810
[background chatter, low music]

442
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,980
- Yeah, he's gonna
turn them into toupees.

443
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,070
- Oh, my god, he is.

444
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,290
- The Hitchcock Way is exactly

445
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,160
what we needed, you know?

446
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,070
These last six months have
actually been pretty hard.

447
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,630
- Mm, no!

448
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,860
Hitchcock doesn't
dwell on the past.

449
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,250
Hitchcock
forgets about the past

450
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,110
because
of the spots on his brain!

451
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
- Yes.

452
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,130
To brain spots!

453
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,210
[glasses clink]

454
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,040
Both: Oh!
Cinnamon schnapps!

455
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,690
- Barkeep, another round
of drink roulette.

456
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,090
- Lieutenant, I never see you
at Shaw's on a Sunday.

457
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,000
Those nights are reserved for
spending time with your family.

458
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,050
I guess you do make...

459
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,040
exceptions.

460
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,440
- What?

461
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,010
- The conversation
we had six months ago?

462
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,010
The one where you
said you wouldn't make

463
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,010
an exception for me.

464
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,230
- That was so long ago.

465
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,880
A lot has happened
since then.

466
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,110
- Well, to me it seems like
mere minutes ago,

467
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,330
because I've been living the
same day over and over again.

468
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,980
- Gentlemen, would either
of you mind giving some toasts?

469
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,020
People are starting to notice
we didn't serve any food.

470
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,730
- I have something
I'd like to say.

471
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,160
- Marriage is amazing.

472
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,030
To get to spend every day
with the same person,

473
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,030
day after day,
month after month on repeat.

474
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,170
The comfort of knowing that
tomorrow

475
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,830
will be just like
today is truly

476
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,160
a rewarding assignment.

477
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,730
To Hitchcock!

478
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,000
- Hear hear.
[glass clinks]

479
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,780
- I'd also like
to make a speech.

480
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,310
Most marriages end in divorce,
and there's a reason.

481
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,780
It's boring to be stuck
in the same routine forever.

482
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,830
There's no value to be found

483
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,150
in walking the same beat
over and over,

484
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,100
especially when you've been
a captain for six years.

485
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,840
The point is: marriage is

486
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,890
a waste of my talents,
Lieutenant.

487
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,060
To Hitchcock!
- These are great.

488
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,110
- Really?

489
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,970
- I also have a toast to make.

490
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,330
Hitchcock, I always thought
I was better than you,

491
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,460
because I haven't been divorced
seven times

492
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,040
and I've never been
banned from a museum

493
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,120
for kissing the statues.

494
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,030
But today I realize

495
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,350
that maybe my life would be
better if I was more like you.

496
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,180
Anyway, I gotta go
make a baby of my own

497
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,400
just like the baby
inside of Anna.

498
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,790
[scattered gasps]

499
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,270
[hands slap]
- Nailed it.

500
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,750
- Why is she
saying these things, Anna?

501
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,400
- Okay, bud.

502
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,400
Are you ready to have some
stupid Hitchcock-style sex?

503
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,890
- Oh, yeah,
where are we going?

504
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,280
- Nowhere.

505
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,460
We're going right here
in Shaw's bathroom.

506
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,060
- Oh, that's such a bad idea.

507
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,110
I love it.

508
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,370
All right.

509
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,970
- Occupied!

510
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,370
- Someone's in there.
Should we wait?

511
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,990
- Would Hitchcock wait?

512
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,950
- Hell no.
Hitchcock would find an alley!

513
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,900
- Well, this is perfect.

514
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,160
There's probably so many skunks
skunking around here.

515
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,170
- Oh, yeah.
We're gonna make a skunk baby.

516
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,170
- Yeah.

517
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,910
- Hello.
- Huh?

518
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,040
- Don't worry about me.
I don't want to join.

519
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,910
I'm happy just to watch.

520
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,270
- [shouting in Russian]

521
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,920
- Crap; they're really
pissed that Anna's pregnant.

522
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,530
- No, it's more
complicated than that.

523
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,000
Anna just called her
entire family hypocrites.

524
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,090
- Wait, you speak Russian?

525
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,100
- Huh.
I guess I do.

526
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,530
I must have picked it up
from speaking to that woman

527
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,150
at the coffee cart
for the past six months.

528
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,460
- [shouting in Russian]

529
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,460
- Now what's happening?

530
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,110
- Anna's mother says Anna

531
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,370
should be
with someone respectable,

532
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,370
like her sister's husband,
Boris, instead of the...

533
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,990
Pig man.
- Well, that's too bad,

534
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,900
'cause she already married
the pig man.

535
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,460
[both shouting in Russian]

536
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,080
What's she saying?

537
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,520
- She says that Boris
is not a good man.

538
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,300
He's cheating on her sister.

539
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,210
She knows because he's
the real father of her baby.

540
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,910
- Oh.
- What?

541
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,050
Oh, no!

542
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,310
[door clicks, Amy gasps]

543
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,000
- Someone's here.
This is too public!

544
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,230
- I mean, it wouldn't
stop Hitchcock, but fine.

545
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,450
I know a secret spot.

546
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,440
[loud crash, both gasp]

547
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,970
- What was that?

548
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,280
What am I feeling right now?
- Huh?

549
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,010
- Are those all your
little hands?

550
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,490
[rodent teeth gnawing]

551
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,630
[dramatic horror music,
guinea pigs squeaking]

552
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,020
[both scream]

553
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,550
[dramatic horror music,
guinea pigs squeaking]

554
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,630
[both scream]

555
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,640
- And this is the last one.

556
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,650
We've rounded up
all the guinea pigs.

557
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,560
- Not even close.

558
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,210
Guinea pig.
Guinea pig.

559
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,220
Guinea pig.
Guinea pig.

560
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,740
What were you thinking,
breeding guinea pigs at work?

561
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,300
- We weren't
breeding them on purpose.

562
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,880
They're just
very sexual creatures,

563
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,050
and we didn't want to
slut-shame them.

564
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,310
- Yeah.

565
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,780
Sorry you're not
more sex-positive, Terry.

566
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,000
- I called my friend
at the lab.

567
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,750
He's gonna take
the guinea pigs.

568
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,220
They're not gonna do
any chemical tests on them.

569
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,350
They're just gonna teach them
how to run mazes.

570
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,960
- Really?

571
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,960
I want you to look
Claire 38 in the eye,

572
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,360
and tell her that—

573
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,800
- I'm sending
you to a lab, Claire; bye.

574
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,360
- You can't do this!

575
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,880
- This is so unfair, Terry!
- You're a cruel man!

576
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,320
- Thank God
he found a way to end it.

577
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,160
- Oh, it's over.
The nightmare's over.

578
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,990
- There you are.

579
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,120
You didn't wake me up
when you left this morning.

580
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,380
- I tried.

581
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,770
You said, "I'm dead.

582
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,160
Leave me.
Find someone new."

583
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,600
- Yeah, pretty hungover.

584
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,590
Look, last night wasn't great,

585
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,070
but I think I know why.

586
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,770
We were trying
to do it like Hitchcock

587
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,390
when we should have been
trying to do it like Boris,

588
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,780
the man who actually
impregnated Hitchcock's wife.

589
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,120
So I found him
on Facebook and—

590
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,120
- Jake, stop.

591
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,730
Why is it so easy

592
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,130
for everyone else
to get pregnant?

593
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,140
I mean, look at
these stupid guinea pigs.

594
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,970
They made 600 babies,

595
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,140
and we can't make one?

596
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,000
Why can't we make 600 babies?

597
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,010
- You can't compare yourself
to guinea pigs, babe.

598
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,230
You taught me that.

599
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,920
- I'm exhausted.

600
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,360
And the universe
keeps telling us

601
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,110
that it doesn't want us
to have a baby.

602
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,370
The message
couldn't be clearer.

603
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,980
So I'm done.

604
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,290
- Like, done for this month?

605
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,680
- Done.
Just done.

606
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
- Thank you for seeing me.

607
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,780
I just wanted to let you know
I was wrong.

608
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,690
Until last night,
I didn't realize

609
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,640
how much Russian I'd learned.

610
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,170
- Yeah, it was impressive.

611
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,990
And your accent was great, too.
- Thank you,

612
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,340
but I actually speak
with the accent of a peasant.

613
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,430
Anyway, I walked my beat
this morning,

614
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
and I spoke to several people
in Russian.

615
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,140
They were so impressed,
they opened up to me.

616
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,140
I got a number of useful tips.
- All right.

617
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,350
All because I made you
do something tedious.

618
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,360
- Monotonous.
Don't ruin this.

619
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,930
- Thanks for coming out
to Hitchcock's divorce party.

620
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,450
- You know you got
another gay cake, right?

621
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,020
- What?
No way.

622
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,670
- It says "Boys! Boys! Boys!"
on it.

623
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,810
- Because we're the boys.

624
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,120
- Guys, I figured out what
went wrong between Anna and me.

625
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,290
My job.
I'm a workaholic!

626
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,980
Not anymore.

627
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,340
From now on, I'm focusing
on what really matters.

628
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,430
Come on, Scully,
let's get some wings.

629
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,350
- Aw, bud,
I thought you'd never ask.

630
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,030
- Hey, want some cake?

631
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,160
I got a piece with a heart
on it,

632
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,820
which I now realize is a butt.

633
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,440
- I'm good.
Thanks.

634
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,220
- So listen.

635
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,220
I've been thinking about
what you said this morning...

636
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,220
And it has been a really hard
couple of months.

637
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,490
- I'm sorry
I'm bad at making babies.

638
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,870
- Hey, hey, don't say that.

639
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,310
It's not your fault.

640
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,060
And look, for all we know,
I could have—

641
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,110
- Don't say you have bum nards.

642
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,760
- I wasn't—I wasn't gonna.

643
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,970
[scoffs]

644
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,330
I think maybe it's just
a thing we can't control.

645
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,240
- That is my least
favorite kind of thing.

646
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,900
- I know.

647
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,950
- I really wanted
to start a family.

648
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,470
- Amy, we are a family.

649
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,120
You and me.

650
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,780
So, you know,
we can keep trying

651
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,300
or look into IVF or adoption

652
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,080
or if we want, we can
forget about the whole thing.

653
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,400
But if we're together,
I'm happy no matter what.

654
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,790
- I don't know
what I want to do.

655
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,390
- Fine.
That's okay too.

656
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,830
We don't have to have a plan.

657
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,490
We make the rules.

658
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,270
Maybe it would help
to just not think

659
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,890
about the whole thing
for a while

660
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,280
and see where we're at.

661
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,410
- Yeah, okay.

662
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:00,800
I love you.

663
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,150
- I love you.

664
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,210
- Should we go?

665
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,520
- Yes.
- Okay.

666
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,950
- Nope.

667
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,380
- [sighs]
