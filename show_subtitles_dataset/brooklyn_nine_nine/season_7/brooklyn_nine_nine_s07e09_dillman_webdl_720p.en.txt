1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,220
- Sir, I'd like to talk to you
about the new task force

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,490
you're on the hiring
committee for.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,450
- The Special Tactical
Operations and Auxiliary

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,190
Strategic Response
Citywide Emergency

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,670
Investigative Unit
for Emergency Operations?

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,630
You know,
I had a hand in naming it.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,230
- And it's great, although you
might wanna try shortening it,

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,370
maybe using a cool acronym.

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,670
- So the
S.T.O.A.S.R.C.E.I.U.E.O.?

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,160
Hm, you're right.
That is cool.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,070
- Sure, anyways, I know some
of the best cops in the city

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,550
are gonna be
on that task force,

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,810
and I would appreciate it
if you'd consider me for it.

14
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,330
Here's my résumé.

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,820
And I thought it would be fun
if I rapped it.

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,250
But then I realized that would
be a terrible idea,

17
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,420
so I just wrote it down
normally.

18
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,990
It'll probably
rhyme a lot on accident.

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,260
Try not to focus on that.

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,560
- "Jake Peralta is age 39,
but professionally,

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,830
he's still in his prime..."

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,050
- "If you ask me,
he's New York's fine... est.

23
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,530
Charles enters."

24
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,310
- ♪ Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat,
Chucky B with the burner ♪

25
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,660
♪ Raining hot fire!

26
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,220
- Charles, it's not a rap.
It never was.

27
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,270
Everyone's professional here.

28
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,050
Not the lyrics
we discussed either.

29
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,760
Anyways, sir, I really think
that I deserve this task force.

30
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,280
My clearance rate puts me
in the top 2% of all NYPD det—

31
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,930
- I am aware of your
qualifications, Peralta,

32
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,670
but I'm only allowed
to recommend one name

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,770
for the
S.T.O.A.S.R.C.E.I.U.E.O.

34
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,540
- And you don't think the
acronym's just a little clunky?

35
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,980
- Oh, no, it's quite catchy.

36
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,080
- Look, I really feel like
I've got what it takes.

37
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,290
I'm experienced,
I'm hardworking,

38
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,900
and I'm unflappable
in the face of—

39
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,250
Oh, my God!
What was that?

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,750
- Scully, are you hurt?

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,450
Is that blood?
- It's glitter.

42
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,880
- There was a box
on Jake's desk.

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,980
I opened it,
and it just exploded.

44
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,240
I can't feel my face.

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,410
- And, not to be rude,

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,420
but is that something
you can normally feel?

47
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,940
- Oh, right.
I guess I'm fine.

48
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,500
- Jeffords,
evacuate the precinct.

49
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,470
I'll contact the bomb squad.
- No, no, no, no, no, wait.

50
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,640
I think this actually
might have been

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,900
a prank that malfunctioned.

52
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,680
Look, the box
was connected to a tank

53
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,120
of compressed air
under the desk.

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,600
It was supposed to shoot
glitter at whoever opened it,

55
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
but something must have clogged
the pressure release valve,

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,910
and the tank exploded.
- Wow.

57
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,600
The silver lining
is no one got hurt.

58
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,610
- And the lead lining
is that this prank

59
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,260
caused significant property
damage in the precinct.

60
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,700
- Fair point, but we do shatter
a lot of glass around here.

61
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,310
Either it's Rosa
who's disappointed

62
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,440
in her Buzzfeed results...

63
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,000
- I am not a Blanche.

64
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,140
- Or Charles
trying to bro out...

65
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,890
- Hut, think fast, dude.

66
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,710
- Or just Terry
gently shutting a window

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,590
and forgetting
how strong he is.

68
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,670
- And look at this.
Evidence was compromised.

69
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,330
- Oh no, the shirt from
the Dekalb Street murder.

70
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,940
- That's the only
hard evidence we have.

71
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,640
ADA Green's already mad
we didn't find anything else.

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,990
- Why is this on your desk,
Peralta?

73
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,640
- I logged it out for trial,
but Officer Howard

74
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,390
is the one who got it
from the evidence locker.

75
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,260
Let's blame him.
He's always up to no good.

76
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,520
- What?
You don't even know me.

77
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,040
- Yes, I do.
- Then what's my last name?

78
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,610
- I thought it was Howard.

79
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,260
- It's Booth.
My name is Howard Booth.

80
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,660
- Okay, fine,
but just so you know,

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,440
the only thing I'm gonna
remember from this interaction

82
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,920
is that you put me
on the spot, so...

83
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,570
- Sir,
I know this is important,

84
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,930
but I kinda gotta go.

85
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,360
Cagney and Lacey's
recorder concert's

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,790
in an hour
and I promised that I—

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,970
- No one leaves
until the culprit

88
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,100
is brought to justice.

89
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,500
- But they're playing
"Uptown Funk."

90
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,060
- I wouldn't care if
they were playing actual music.

91
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,360
Whoever did this was obviously

92
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,500
someone Peralta pranked
seeking revenge.

93
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,800
Who are his recent victims?

94
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,670
- I'm sorry,
but I'm the Prankmaster General

95
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,420
and I take that role
very seriously.

96
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,550
- Look at this.
There's a note.

97
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,430
It says, "Gotcha back, babe."
It was Amy.

98
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,780
Who else would
call Jake "babe"?

99
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,520
- Charles went through
that year-long phase

100
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,470
where he called
everybody "babe."

101
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,480
- Uh-huh.
- I forget.

102
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,570
Did you guys like that?

103
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
No.

104
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,780
- I still think it was Amy.

105
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,520
- Obviously I'm being framed,

106
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,440
probably by whomever
keeps accusing me.

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,870
- No one's asking
the obvious question.

108
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,710
Why did Scully open a package
on Peralta's desk?

109
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,230
Perhaps he was
setting up the prank,

110
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,270
and it blew up
in his face.

111
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,660
- No, I just saw a box
and I thought,

112
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,450
"Oh, cookies come in boxes."

113
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,500
- I bet it wasn't anyone
in this squad.

114
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,890
- That's exactly what
a guilty person would say.

115
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,370
- So in order to prove
my innocence,

116
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,450
I just need to start
pointing fingers?

117
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,540
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,850
- Fine, it was Amy.
- Really?

119
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,890
Because the "Babe" thing
screams you, Charles.

120
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,900
- Oh, you wanna hear screaming?
It was Amy!

121
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,420
- Somebody confess!

122
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,430
Well, well, well.

123
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,990
What do we have here?

124
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,260
It appears a crime
has been committed,

125
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,350
and no one will confess.

126
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,390
- Doing a German accent?
- I was going for Belgian,

127
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,530
Like in "Murder on
the Orient Express."

128
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,660
- You sound like a Nazi.

129
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,740
- Okay, not a great note
to hear.

130
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,920
I'll just use my normal voice.

131
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,350
The point is a crime
has been committed,

132
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,750
and someone in this room
did it.

133
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,620
There are seven suspects
all with means and motive.

134
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,230
It appears what we have
is a classic whodunit.

135
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,880
- The phrase "whodunit"
is a grammatical abomination.

136
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,850
Please use the proper term,
a "who has done this."

137
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,550
- I will not, however,
in order to solve this case,

138
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,940
we need the very finest
of detectives,

139
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,770
one with a unique set
of skills, someone named—

140
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,250
- Dillman!
I'll call Dillman!

141
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,300
- Who?

142
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,050
- I hear you need some help
with a "who has done this."

143
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,310
- Squad,
meet detective Frank Dillman

144
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,740
of the San Francisco PD.

145
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,180
He is in town,
and we were supposed

146
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,800
to have lunch tomorrow,
but I asked him to come down

147
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,670
because I need an objective
set of eyes on this.

148
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,410
- I can be objective.
- Then tell me.

149
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,100
How do I look today?
- Normal?

150
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:23,980
- No.
Dillman?

151
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,110
- Bloated.
- Thank you.

152
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,540
Dillman is the single
best detective

153
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,840
I have ever worked with.

154
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,500
Sadly, he was unjustly fired
for investigating

155
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,500
corruption in the NYPD.

156
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,810
He hated dirty cops so much

157
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,980
they used to call him
Mr. Clean.

158
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,160
- Uh-huh, I'm sure
that's the only reason

159
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,460
they called him that.

160
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,860
- Because I'm bald?
You think that's funny?

161
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,210
I started shaving my head
20 years ago in solidarity

162
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,600
with my mother who was
undergoing chemotherapy.

163
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,600
- Oh, look, I'm so sorry—

164
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,780
- I'm obviously lying.

165
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,910
It's classic
male pattern baldness.

166
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,820
But now,
based on your reaction,

167
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,530
I know every single thing
about you as a person.

168
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,920
- That can't be true.
- It is.

169
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,010
You're cooked.
- All right, let's get started.

170
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:57,700
I want written statements
from every witness—

171
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,190
personnel files
for the entire squad.

172
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,580
Of course, I need to have
this desk dusted for prints,

173
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,620
see if we get a hit
on the AFI system.

174
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,150
Somebody could maybe get rid
of those pigeons.

175
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,580
And, of course, I'll need
to see any surveillance video.

176
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,200
- Unfortunately,
this area's a blind spot.

177
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,020
The camera that covers it
broke two weeks ago,

178
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,410
and it hasn't been fixed yet.

179
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,250
- Really don't want me
to see that security footage,

180
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,630
do you, Lieutenant?

181
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,640
Hm, I wonder why.
- I was just stating the facts.

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,120
I didn't do anything
to the camera.

183
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,640
- I never thought you did,
but now I know

184
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,200
every single thing
about you as a person.

185
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,820
- Everyone back off.

186
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,560
Dillman has the scene.

187
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,780
- Man, this sucks.

188
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,170
This case would have been
the perfect chance for you

189
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,300
to prove to Holt that you
deserve that task force.

190
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,700
- Yeah.
Maybe it still is.

191
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,440
Holt thinks Dillman's
the best detective

192
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,790
he's ever worked with,
so what happens

193
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,140
if I solve the case before him?

194
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,050
Then I become the best
detective Holt has ever

195
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,150
worked with, and he has
to give me the task force.

196
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,490
Dillman thinks he knows
everything about me

197
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,230
as a person, but there's
one thing he doesn't know.

198
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,500
I'm about to take him down—

199
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,800
oh, my God,
he's staring right at us.

200
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,410
Quick, pretend like
I was saying something else.

201
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,320
- Yes, Jake, you were young
when you lost your virginity.

202
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,590
- Thank you, Charles!

203
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,810
- The DA's office called.
Greene is furious.

204
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,460
He thinks he may have to drop
all charges in the Dekalb case.

205
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,640
Whoever did this is facing
a massive suspension,

206
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,160
and there's no use hiding

207
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,860
because Dillman
will smoke you out.

208
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,380
- Right, but is there any way
he could hurry it up?

209
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,560
So far it's just been a lot
of silent pacing.

210
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,650
- Would you ask a heart surgeon
to hurry it up?

211
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:17,470
- I mean, I would if he was
just walking around a room.

212
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,910
- Okay, here's what we know.

213
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,830
The glitter bomb was placed
between 12:20 and 12:55.

214
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,570
All the suspects say
they were at lunch

215
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,320
and have an alibi
for that time,

216
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,750
which means
one of you is lying.

217
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,140
- It was Terry.

218
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,840
Thanks for coming by, Dill,
but I got it from here.

219
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,190
- You see, Terrence,
I couldn't help but notice

220
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,750
you're not wearing
suspenders today—

221
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,060
odd, considering suspenders
are your entire personality.

222
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,680
- Seems a little reductive.

223
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,110
I had a rough childhood,

224
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,590
but I lifted myself up
through arts and athletics—

225
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,330
- Ah-buh-buh-buhp.
You're the suspenders guy.

226
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,460
Something felt fishy,
so Jakey went fishing,

227
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,080
and I caught me a fat one.

228
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,600
And look at that—

229
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,340
Terry's suspenders
stuffed into his desk drawer,

230
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,250
and there's glitter on them—
red glitter.

231
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,220
Feels like that deserved
an audible gasp.

232
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,480
- Thank you, Charles.

233
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,090
You got messy
setting up the prank.

234
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,350
You didn't want
anyone to see.

235
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,830
You put the suspenders
in your desk drawer.

236
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,390
Case closed.

237
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,790
- Did you put that folder there
just so you could close it?

238
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,010
- Yes, Rosa, obviously.

239
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,360
- I didn't do anything.

240
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,450
- Well, if you didn't
do anything,

241
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,840
how come the case is closed?

242
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,010
- It's not.
- Hm?

243
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,540
- The glitter
on Jeffords' suspenders

244
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,500
is type 9A round red glitter
while the bomb spewed

245
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,720
type 9C round red glitter,
but then I suppose

246
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,070
all round red glitter
looks the same to you.

247
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,160
- No.
I know the difference.

248
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,940
One is bigger?
- Shinier.

249
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,160
- Ah.

250
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,420
- The number refers
to the size.

251
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,980
The letter refers
to its reflective qualities.

252
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,290
- Seems like you know a weird
amount about glitter, man.

253
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,210
- So good detective work
is weird to you?

254
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,950
Interesting squad
you have here, Raymond.

255
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,640
- I didn't choose them.
They were here when I arrived.

256
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,690
- Understood.

257
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,130
The real question is
why Jeffords

258
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,430
had glitter on him at all.

259
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,960
Fortunately, I have the answer.

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I deduced that he has
three young daughters—

261
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,360
twins and a toddler.

262
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,230
- Big deal.
You saw the picture on his desk.

263
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,270
- I did, and judging by

264
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,360
the maple trees in
the background of that picture,

265
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,790
it was taken last fall—
probably mid October.

266
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,630
The twins are smiling,
each revealing a missing tooth.

267
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,060
The twin on the right—
let's call her "Twin A."

268
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,410
- That's Cagney.
- Is that relevant?

269
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,710
- It's her name.
- So no.

270
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
- Twin A is missing
an upper right incisor

271
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,460
while Twin B is missing
a lower left incisor

272
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,630
suggesting that they were seven
when the photo was taken,

273
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,290
which would put them
in second grade.

274
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,070
Spring semester
of second grade is when

275
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,780
the Brooklyn schools
do their solar system unit,

276
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,340
a highlight of which
is constructing

277
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,730
a mobile of the planets.

278
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,520
My hypothesis is that Twin A
and Twin B requested

279
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,300
Daddy's help making Mars
sparkle, hence the red glitter.

280
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,570
- Damn, yeah,
that's exactly right.

281
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,740
- Just seems like
a very complicated way

282
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,180
of saying Terry has kids.
- Thank you.

283
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,400
- What?

284
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,570
- The point is,
Jeffords is innocent,

285
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,580
so I guess it's fair to say
case open.

286
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,840
- My God, I have gooseflesh.

287
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,800
- So now I'd like to move on
to a real suspect.

288
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,450
I wanna see detective Diaz
in the box.

289
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,230
- What—don't gasp for him.

290
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,540
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

291
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,100
It just slipped out.
- Title of your sex tape.

292
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,240
- Yeah, it's—obviously
it's the title of his sex tape.

293
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,930
Everyone's taking my stuff.

294
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,730
- Dillman never talks first
when he's in the box.

295
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,730
- Well, Rosa never initiates
conversation of any kind.

296
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,830
- Guys, I really
have to get out of here.

297
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,050
Somebody please say something
to get it started.

298
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,520
- No.
- And there it is.

299
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,740
Now that I have the upper hand,
let's get started.

300
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,740
- Stupid Terry
and his stupid kids.

301
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,440
You were the only suspect
who did not go out for lunch,

302
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,220
but if you were eating
at your desk,

303
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,400
how did you not see
the perpetrator

304
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,750
plant the glitter bomb?

305
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,970
- I wasn't at my desk.
I was in the break room.

306
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,400
- Oh, the break room.
That explains it.

307
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,840
I guess we're done here.

308
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,230
- Oh, here it comes—
the Dillman double back.

309
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,670
- Just to double back—

310
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,500
- Oh, my.
He actually said the words.

311
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,760
What a treat.

312
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,290
- If you were
in the break room,

313
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,070
why was the IP address
of your laptop

314
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,290
logged into the Wi-Fi
on the fifth floor?

315
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,940
- Fine.

316
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,080
There's an empty office there
where I go to be alone.

317
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,390
- Seems innocent enough.
Why would you lie about that?

318
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,000
Maybe because you were up there
assembling a glitter bomb.

319
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,780
- I'm sorry, I didn't—
- I was watching a soap opera.

320
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,660
It's called "Drake's Hollow."
I never miss an episode.

321
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,790
It's my mother's favorite show,
and when things were bad

322
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,270
between us,
it was the one thing

323
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,140
that we could still talk about.
- Oh, that's sweet.

324
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,570
- It is kind of sweet.

325
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,490
- Sweet enough to fool
a lesser detective.

326
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,660
- What—I wasn't fooled.
Take her away.

327
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,630
- If you really watch
"Drake's Hollow" every day,

328
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,190
you won't mind if I give you
a little quiz.

329
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,230
You see, I've been known
to visit the Hollow myself

330
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,150
from time to time not unlike
Nicholas Van Bronderberg.

331
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,290
Who's the father
of Eliana's twins?

332
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,460
- Christian is Jacob's father,

333
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,070
but Joshua was stolen
from the hospital.

334
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,590
His real father
remains unknown.

335
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,770
- Who did Joshua
grow up to marry?

336
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,250
First came Sandra,
then there was Brigitte,

337
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,470
but she turned out
to be his sister.

338
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,950
Katherine died
during childbirth,

339
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,470
though it was later revealed
that she was murdered

340
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,950
by Amanda,
Joshua's next wife.

341
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,990
They divorced after Amanda

342
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,170
was sentenced
to the electric chair.

343
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,990
But Joshua rebounded quickly
with Jasmine.

344
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,820
Jasmine was followed by Grace,
the love of his life,

345
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,520
but she had a contract dispute
with the producers

346
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,270
so she was killed
off camera by a snake.

347
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,660
You messed up.

348
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
You forgot Gwendolyn.
- No, I didn't.

349
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,740
Joshua and Gwendolyn were
technically never married

350
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,490
because that whole season took
place inside Kiki's mind...

351
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,530
While she was in a coma.

352
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,360
- Diaz is innocent.

353
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,330
- So I guess he was wrong
about Rosa.

354
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,150
- Don't worry about Dillman.

355
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,190
He's the best detective
I've ever worked with.

356
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,850
- Or you just
keep talking him up

357
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,800
because you don't want us
to notice how weird it is

358
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,240
that you brought in a friend
to work the case.

359
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,470
- We're not friends.

360
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,730
My only friends
are James and Julian.

361
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,510
- Hurtful, but I still
think it's strange

362
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,940
that you won't let me
run the investigation—

363
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,470
unless, of course,
there's something

364
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,900
you're scared I might find.

365
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,040
- Excuse me?

366
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,520
- Where were you between
12:20 and 12:55?

367
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,040
- You aren't
seriously suggesting

368
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,300
that I am the prank man.

369
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,910
- It does seem
a little far-fetched, Jake.

370
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,040
I mean, he did just use
the phrase, "prank man."

371
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,400
- It's not far-fetched at all.

372
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,700
Holt is not the joyless robot
that he once was.

373
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,390
- Is this about the time
I ate a burrito?

374
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,530
I was pressured into it.

375
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,090
- Just tell us
where you were at lunch.

376
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,620
- Well, if you must know,
I was having lunch with Boyle.

377
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,710
No way.

378
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,270
You two are
the second most unlikely

379
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,580
Nine-Nine lunch combination.

380
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,270
First is anyone
with Hitchcock and Scully.

381
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,760
Second is Holt and Charles.

382
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,190
- It is pretty strange.

383
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,200
- I mean, obviously
it was uncomfortable,

384
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,290
but it was a work lunch.

385
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,510
- Look, it's not
a big deal, guys.

386
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,760
We don't have to talk about it.

387
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,640
- I was offering him
the task force position.

388
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,810
Boyle is my choice.

389
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,850
- Boyle?

390
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,730
From work?

391
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,210
Oh.

392
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,040
How great for him...
And no one else.

393
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,470
You know what, I just remembered
that I'm late to leave.

394
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,610
Gotta go, bye.

395
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,610
- Hey.

396
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,960
- I don't understand, Charles.

397
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,520
If Holt already assigned you
to the task force,

398
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,880
why were you helping me
try and get it?

399
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,010
- I was planning
on telling Holt no.

400
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,530
- What?
That's insane.

401
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,050
It's a huge opportunity.

402
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,970
- I know, but I've been meaning
to cut back on hours.

403
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,530
I'm working too much.

404
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,020
It's affecting Nikolaj
at school.

405
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,020
He's been making
so many new friends.

406
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,370
- Wait,
isn't that a good thing?

407
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,370
- No, he's trying
to get me jealous.

408
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,890
I did the same thing to my dad.

409
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,110
So, Jake, for real.

410
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,280
I'm not gonna take
the assignment.

411
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,160
Okay, I guess that makes sense.

412
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,720
But just promise me you're not
turning it down because of me.

413
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,550
- Jake, I promise.

414
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,680
- Okay.

415
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,600
Great, well,

416
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,290
if you're turning it down,
that means there's still

417
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,650
an opportunity for me
to solve the case

418
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,300
and prove to Holt
I belong on the task force.

419
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,260
- What task force?
both:

420
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,170
- How long have you been here?
- Just a few seconds.

421
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,440
But that was
more than enough time

422
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,960
for me to ascertain
everything about you—

423
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,220
- As a person, yes, we know.
No one likes a know-it-all.

424
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,870
- You're married to one.

425
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,400
- You're married to one.
- Follow me.

426
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,050
I have an important
announcement to make.

427
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,710
both: Dillman.

428
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,230
- May I have everyone's
attention please?

429
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,660
I have solved the,
"who has done this."

430
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,490
I know by whom it was done.

431
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,110
It was Jake Peralta.
- What?

432
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,330
That's crazy.
The box was on my desk.

433
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,850
I'm the victim.
- Wrong.

434
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,590
Scully's the victim.
- You know,

435
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,200
you think glitter's gonna taste
like sprinkles, but it doesn't.

436
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,590
It tastes like blood.
- That is blood.

437
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,770
The glitter's
shredding your tongue.

438
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:18,940
- Oh.

439
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,900
- Why would I blow up
my own desk?

440
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,420
- For the task force.

441
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,040
I just heard you say
you wanted to prove to Holt

442
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,210
that you're
a great detective.

443
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,770
That's why you set
this whole thing up.

444
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,170
It was a perfect plan,

445
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,950
and you would've gotten away
with it if not for me.

446
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,350
- Wow.
You're a lunatic.

447
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,260
- Would a lunatic know
that your body temperature

448
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,690
just rose 9/10 of a degree
indicating guilt?

449
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,260
- Yes.
- Oh, look.

450
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,790
What do we have here—

451
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,400
a receipt from Party Zone

452
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,090
for one air tank rental
paid in cash.

453
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,230
- That's not mine.
I never keep my receipts.

454
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,450
Amy, tell them.

455
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,800
Tell them how much
our accountant hates me.

456
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,230
- She hates him so much.

457
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,460
- My bag was sitting
next to my desk.

458
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,930
Anyone could have
put that in there.

459
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,150
That kind of evidence
would never hold up at trial.

460
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,450
You'd be laughed out of court.

461
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,760
- I've only been laughed at
in court once,

462
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,540
and that was because
I made a terrific joke.

463
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,370
- I was there.
It was hilarious.

464
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,550
- Come on.

465
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,770
- I guess it's fair to say
case closed.

466
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,120
- No.
He stole that from me.

467
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,340
- Go home.

468
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,600
You're suspended
until further notice.

469
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,900
- This is nuts.

470
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,260
I can't believe
Holt believes

471
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,480
that ridiculous windbag
and his sack of lies.

472
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,130
Oh, I know everything about
glitter and "Drake's Elbow."

473
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,430
- "Hollow."
- Amy, please.

474
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,660
I just need your support
right now, okay?

475
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,140
- Wait a minute,
you believe me, right?

476
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,010
- Of course I do.
I'm your wife.

477
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,360
I'm on your side
no matter what.

478
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,790
Thanks.

479
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,140
Same, by the way.
- Thanks.

480
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,700
I mean,
no one really suspects me.

481
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,140
- Right.
- Look, go home.

482
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,150
I'll check for prints
on the Party Zone receipt.

483
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,580
Yours won't be there,
but maybe someone else's will.

484
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,010
- Wait a minute.
Prints—that's it.

485
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,930
I think I know who framed me.
- Who?

486
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,070
- I can't say yet.
I wanna be sure.

487
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,290
- You wanna do
a big, dramatic reveal

488
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,550
in front of everyone,
don't you?

489
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,680
- Yes, obviously.

490
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,680
Look, I have to check
on one thing.

491
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,240
Don't let anybody leave.
- Okay.

492
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,900
Attention, everyone.

493
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,590
Stop what you are doing.

494
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,950
Eh, still a little Nazi.

495
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm gonna just drop the accent.

496
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,430
- Peralta, you can't be here.
You're suspended.

497
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,990
And you're lucky
it's not worse.

498
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,350
The DA's office
wanted you fired.

499
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,610
- I'm being framed,
and I know who did it.

500
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,690
It was Dillman!

501
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,530
I just met you today.

502
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,090
Why would I do that?
- Good question.

503
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,180
It's because you want Holt
to put you on that task force.

504
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,180
- Dillman can't be
on a New York task force.

505
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,930
The SFPD would never
approve it.

506
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,190
- Correct, only he's not SFPD.

507
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,490
When you first arrived,
you asked us to check

508
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,590
the fingerprints
against the AFI system,

509
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,190
but that system hasn't
been used in over five years

510
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,550
by any police department.

511
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,120
- Well, I used
the AFI system for 20 years.

512
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,060
I guess I misspoke.
- Oh, misspoke.

513
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,240
I see.
That explains everything.

514
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,860
My apologies.

515
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,990
I'm just gonna
head back on out to exile—

516
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,250
just to double back.

517
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,770
- My God.
He's double backing Dillman.

518
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,170
- How could the best detective
that Holt's ever worked with

519
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,390
make such a mistake?

520
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,690
I wondered myself,
so I made a few phone calls.

521
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,260
It turns out,
Dillman was fired by the SFPD.

522
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,080
I guess he rubbed the brass
the wrong way.

523
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,570
Not only that,
but he's currently working

524
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,350
part time at Yarn Barn,
a hobby shop in Albany.

525
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,740
I have his manager
on the phone right now.

526
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,840
- Frank, what is going on?
You have a shift tonight.

527
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,230
You know I have finals.

528
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,710
I'm so sorry, Alyssa.

529
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,880
I got hung up in the city.
I just lost track of time.

530
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,410
- This explains everything.
He's not a great detective.

531
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,410
He's a sad man
working part time

532
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,190
selling crafting supplies.

533
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,030
- Okay, fine, yes.
I was fired by the SFPD.

534
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,410
And yes, I contacted Raymond

535
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,900
in hopes of getting on
that task force.

536
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,250
I thought it would be my way
back onto the NYPD.

537
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,770
Oh, my God.
I hate the Yarn Barn.

538
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,330
- Really disappointing
to hear, Frank,

539
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,860
- Yeah, well you're
a bad manager, Alyssa, okay?

540
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,380
You play favorites and it hurts
to be on the outside.

541
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,550
- You don't even show up to—
- Okay.

542
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,730
- I was gonna bring up
the task force

543
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,250
when I had lunch
with Raymond tomorrow,

544
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,870
but when he called
about this case,

545
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,130
I thought solving it
would seal the deal—

546
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,170
- Which would have been easy
since you set

547
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,260
the whole thing up to frame me.

548
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,610
- Ridiculous.

549
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,390
Why would I have waited
so long to accuse you?

550
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,400
- Because if you
solved it right away,

551
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,530
it would've been too obvious.

552
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,570
- He's deflecting
because he's guilty.

553
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:34,960
- Dillman lied about
where he worked.

554
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,190
We can't trust him.

555
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,140
- The receipt was
in Peralta's bag.

556
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,270
- You're the glitter expert.

557
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
- Well, you're
the Prankmaster General.

558
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,280
both: It was him.

559
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,800
- It wasn't either of you,

560
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,150
but I know who it was.

561
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,500
- Son of a bitch
stole my bullhorn.

562
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,590
- Okay, I'm not 100% sure
this is right,

563
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,370
and maybe
I'm missing something—

564
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,810
- Charles, as a veteran
of many big reveals,

565
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,940
can I give you a tip?

566
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,560
Not so much waffling.
- I agree.

567
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,510
You're not commanding the room.

568
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,470
- Let him finish—his way.

569
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,470
But do pace it up a bit,
Charles.

570
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,820
- Copy that.

571
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,780
So from the beginning,
I was very skeptical

572
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,000
that anyone in our squad
was behind the prank.

573
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,560
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I did, and then you said,

574
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,310
"That's exactly what
a guilty person would say."

575
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,350
- Eh, I stand by it.

576
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,440
- Okay, so who was
the prank man?

577
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
- There was no prank.

578
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,880
That was just a cover.

579
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,450
You see, guys,
the point of the explosion

580
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,620
was to contaminate the evidence
of the Dekalb Street murder.

581
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,050
- But the suspect is in prison,
has no ties to organized crime,

582
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,360
and no means
of bribing an officer.

583
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,150
How could he have possibly
pulled that off?

584
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,800
- Yeah, Jake, that stumped me
for a little bit too,

585
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,100
but then something you said
gave me an idea.

586
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,980
- I mean, that kind of evidence
would never hold up at trial.

587
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,330
You'd be laughed out of court.

588
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,720
Ah, yeah,
I remember when I said that.

589
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,550
It was awesome.
Wait, but who did it?

590
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,810
- The mastermind
was ADA Greene.

591
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,600
He didn't have enough evidence
for the case.

592
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,950
He was afraid
he was gonna lose

593
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,470
and needed someone
to blame it on.

594
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,820
- Whom did he work with—

595
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,600
obviously someone who knew
about the pranks

596
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,780
and that Amy called Jake
"babe."

597
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,210
- Excellent question, Captain.

598
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,310
It took a little digging
to find that out,

599
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,920
but I pulled
some personnel files

600
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
and combed through
some social media.

601
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,830
Do you know what
Greene's wife's maiden name is?

602
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,960
- Duchovny?
- No.

603
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,050
- Zappa.
- No.

604
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,660
- Fagerbakke.
- No, Booth.

605
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,490
Howard Booth—

606
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,660
as in, Officer Booth.

607
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,800
- Oh, yes.
Officer Howard.

608
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,230
- He's Greene's brother-in-law.

609
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
He didn't just put the evidence
on Jake's desk.

610
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,280
He put the glitter bomb there.
- Oh, my God.

611
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,630
We have to find Booth.
- Already did it.

612
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,980
And I booked him.

613
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,850
- Oh, classic elevator reveal.

614
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,680
This feels like it calls
for an audible gasp.

615
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,110
- Not from you, Charles.

616
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,380
From me.

617
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,690
- Wait, did you just
gasp at my gasp?

618
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,470
- Sorry.
Your gasp was so good.

619
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,900
- Oh, thank you for gasping
at my gasp.

620
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,470
- My pleasure.

621
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,300
- Sorry you missed
your daughter's concert.

622
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,560
- No, no, it's okay.

623
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,390
Sharon totally understood—

624
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,430
after I lied to her
and said we had to stay late

625
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,610
because Rosa got shot.

626
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,390
Next time you see her,
walk with a limp.

627
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,360
- Copy that.

628
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,450
- Hey, you know you don't
have to sweep up, right?

629
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,750
- Well, someone's gotta.

630
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,230
Plus it reminds me
of the three years I spent

631
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,660
as a cleaning lady in college.

632
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,060
- Huh, I guess there really
is no term for cleaning man.

633
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,890
- Mm-mm.
- That's not great.

634
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,410
So hey, listen.

635
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,890
I wanted to say great job today
and also I'm sorry.

636
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,190
- Sorry for what?

637
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,500
- Well, when I heard
you got the task force,

638
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,420
my first reaction was just
to feel sad for myself

639
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,550
instead of happy for you.

640
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,550
- Well, you sure hid it well.

641
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,900
- I really didn't.

642
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,730
I stormed into the other room
and moped by myself.

643
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,730
- Eh, but you had style.

644
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,080
- Charles, no.
Look.

645
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,040
You have to take
the task force job.

646
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
- Really?
What about Nikolaj?

647
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,920
- He's gonna be so proud
of his dad.

648
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,650
I bet he even ditches
those new friends.

649
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,910
- Oh, man.
That's the dream.

650
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,750
Thank you for saying that.

651
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,260
Honestly, though, I still don't
get why Holt chose me over you.

652
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,050
- Are you kidding?
I mean, just look at today.

653
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,920
Instead of fighting
for attention,

654
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,620
you did the work and
methodically built your case.

655
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,360
You noticed things that
a room full of seasoned cops

656
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,710
all missed.

657
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,450
You're a great detective,
Charles.

658
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,840
- Wow.

659
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,980
Even in defeat,
you are a true prince of a man.

660
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,760
The task force is yours.
- What? No.

661
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,110
Boyle, just take the win!

662
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,150
- Right.
- It was good to see you today.

663
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,420
I'll keep my ears open for any
job opportunities that arise.

664
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,770
- Appreciate it.
I could use it.

665
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,210
Just got a text from Alyssa I've
been fired by the Yarn Barn.

666
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,600
- Well, you still the best damn
detective I've ever worked with.

667
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,290
- Thank you.

668
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,780
Wait a minute.

669
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,430
Your iris just contracted
by 1/10th of a millimeter.

670
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,740
You're lying.

671
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,520
- Yes, I've lost a lot
of respect for you today.

672
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,660
- Understood.

673
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,220
Goodbye, Raymond.

674
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,190
- Well...

675
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,920
Since Dillman is clearly
out of the top spot now,

676
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,800
who's the best detective
you've ever worked with?

677
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,360
- It's Sergeant
Leslie Hunt-Minkoff.

678
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,590
- Who?

679
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,500
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
