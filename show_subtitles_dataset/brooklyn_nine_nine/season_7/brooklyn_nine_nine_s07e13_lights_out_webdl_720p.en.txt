1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,850
- And those of you
patrolling 7th avenue,

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,670
please be aware of the new
pedal pubs.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,240
They're bike-powered
mobile bars

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,030
that are very popular
with bachelorette parties.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,860
But unfortunately they have
led to a dramatic increase

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,860
in the rarely seen case
of female public urination.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,340
- Resist.
- That's everything,

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,730
but before we go home,
but quick reminder that today

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,350
is Sergeant Santiago's last day
before maternity leave.

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,870
We'll see you
in three months.

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,000
- She gets three months off?
Can I take a maternity leave?

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,700
- Are you giving birth
to a baby?

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,920
- I'm having a seven pound mass

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,660
removed from my abdomen
next week.

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,660
- Yeah, never ask
Scully questions.

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,660
That's on me, guys!

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,710
- Dismissed.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,760
- So, have you guys decided
on a name yet?

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,590
- We're not telling people
until he's born.

20
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,370
- Not the baby's name—my name.
What's he gonna call me?

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,280
Uncle Chuck? Unky C? Ooh—
Chee-Chee, so he says it early?

22
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,550
- Maybe just Charles.

23
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,290
- Wait, so my dad gets to be
his "Pop-Pop,"

24
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,550
but I'm just "Charles?"

25
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,290
- Your dad does not get
to be his "Pop-Pop."

26
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,770
- Well I hope you're prepared
to make that phone call.

27
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,730
- Uh, what was that?

28
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,080
- Wow, all of Brooklyn
lost power.

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,900
- You know, I've always
kind of liked blackouts.

30
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,040
Listen to how quiet it is.
It's so peaceful.

31
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,000
Nope, it immediately
turned into a purge.

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,740
Way to go, New York.
All right, let's suit up!

33
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,380
- Maybe it's not so bad
out there.

34
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,640
I mean, none of our phone
are ringing.

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,030
- That's because all
the cell towers are down.

36
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,900
Nobody has landlines anymore,
so they can't call in.

37
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,770
- Huh, really makes you think
about society's reliance

38
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,420
on modern technology,
doesn't it?

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,650
- No.
- Yeah, me neither.

40
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,780
I just thought maybe
that's how you see it.

41
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,740
- Guys, stop wasting time.
Headlamps on!

42
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,430
- We have to engage
in blackout protocol.

43
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,690
- I'm surprised, those guys are
really springing into action.

44
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,090
Nope, they're just eating all
the food in the fridge

45
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,610
before it goes bad.

46
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,960
- There's a dozen sandwiches
here, I don't know what kind.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,780
- I'll figure it out later.
Just start chewing.

48
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,830
- Yeah, they suck.

49
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,480
- So, only
Captain Holt or Terry

50
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,450
can initiate
actual blackout protocol,

51
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,800
but I don't see
them anywhere.

52
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,450
- Guys?
Where did our dads go?

53
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,450
- Hello? Anyone?

54
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,540
We're stuck in the elevator!

55
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,840
- Can't you yell any louder?

56
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,720
Use those big strong lungs
you're always flexing.

57
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,940
- These are my pecs.

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,370
- So this is all just
for show then.

59
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,670
It has no functional purpose.

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,370
- I mean, I am pretty strong.

61
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,730
- Good, then rip
those doors open.

62
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,550
- I can't do that.
- Oh, well at least you haven't

63
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,640
dedicated a significant
portion of your life

64
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,720
to looking like this.

65
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,860
- What is with you?
- I'm sorry.

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,900
This is a nightmare of mine.

67
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,000
I have a phobia of elevators.

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,830
It stems from a traumatic
experience I had as a child.

69
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,480
- They only perform
rated-load testing

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,700
on city elevators
every five years?

71
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,130
Oh, my.

72
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,180
That was the last time I read
the municipal code before bed.

73
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,880
But...

74
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,270
the damage was done.

75
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,150
- Wait, look at this, sir.
I think we'll be fine.

76
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,890
It was inspected
four months ago.

77
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,850
By Walter Beverly,
the clown prince

78
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,200
of the
Department of Buildings.

79
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,160
You've made it so much worse.
Help!

80
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,770
Help!

81
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,120
- Yeah, they're trapped
in there.

82
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,680
- Oh no, that means
we have to call

83
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,160
the fire department.

84
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,860
- Or, hear me out,
we leave them in there forever,

85
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
and move on emotionally.

86
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,040
- No.
Call the fire department.

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,690
All right,
as the highest ranking officer

88
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,040
not trapped in a box,
I'll take charge.

89
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,430
- Uh, shouldn't you
be taking it easy?

90
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,470
Your shift's over.
You're on maternity leave.

91
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,780
As the baby's Chee-Chee—
- Charles, I'm fine,

92
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,090
and this is an emergency.

93
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,650
Subways aren't running,
and we're gonna have

94
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
a lot of people on the street.

95
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,780
So I'm gonna call
Mounted Division

96
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,010
to help with crowd control.

97
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,490
- But that's
Sergeant Peanut Butter's unit.

98
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,530
No one wants to work with that
condescending dick.

99
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,230
- Okay, first of all,
he's a horse,

100
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,840
so he can't be condescending.

101
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,800
- Ugh, oh-ho, he's got you
people fooled.

102
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,670
- Secondly...

103
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,710
He's a lieutenant now.
- What? How?

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,540
- Charles, get it together.
I want you and Jake

105
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,770
to go to
the Gowanus power substation.

106
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,150
That's where
the transformer exploded.

107
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,940
Work with ESU,
get us a timetable

108
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,500
for the power being restored,
and hurry!

109
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,250
- Wow, look at my pregnant wife
taking charge.

110
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,070
I don't know whether
to be proud or turned on.

111
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
- I said hurry.
- Oh, my God, it's both.

112
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,990
Hey, what happened?

113
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
- Someone lost control
of their car,

114
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,730
jumped the curb,
went through the fence,

115
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,130
and rammed
into the transformer.

116
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,910
Guy must have been drunk.
There was an empty bottle

117
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,130
of vodka on the floor
of the car.

118
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,690
- Okay, Charles,
I see two possibilities.

119
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,180
One, he was vaporized
into a being

120
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,090
of pure electricity,
becoming a supervillian

121
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,570
known only as
"The Surge Freak."

122
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,220
- Seems unlikely.
- Yeah, I know, Officer Rick,

123
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,840
that's why I said there were
two possibilities.

124
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,060
He probably just hobbled off
so he wouldn't get a DUI.

125
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,800
Here, we'll follow this very
obvious trail of blood.

126
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,890
Happy now?

127
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,630
Stupid Officer Rick
and his stupid

128
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,630
joyless approach to life.
Come on.

129
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,110
- I can't see anything.
- Me neither.

130
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,890
We'll just have to rely
on our other senses.

131
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,200
- I call smell.

132
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,110
- Okay, really jumped
on that one.

133
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,600
I wasn't gonna fight you
for smell.

134
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,950
I figured we'd just
listen for sounds.

135
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,040
- Pfft, good luck with that.

136
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,600
Hmm.

137
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,860
Yeah.

138
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,130
Mm-hmm.

139
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,950
- Okay.
- How's it going over there?

140
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,350
You hearing anything?

141
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,000
- Yeah, I'm hearing you
and your creepy sniffs.

142
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,230
- Really? Well I'm smelling
a lot of jealousy

143
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,710
coming from your direction.

144
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,970
- Sound to the left.
- Smell to the left.

145
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,100
- NYPD, hands up!

146
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,230
Oh, yeah, we got him.

147
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,580
- Charles.

148
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,270
- Aw, this ice cream
is melting.

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,540
- Who cares?
We can drink melted ice cream.

150
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,760
We can't eat spoiled ham.

151
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,020
We have to prioritize!

152
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,540
- What if we combine them?

153
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,640
Wrap the ice cream
in the ham like a taquito.

154
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,810
- This man.
This man is my best friend.

155
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,290
- You two are the worst people
to have around in an emergency.

156
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,640
I literally can't
imagine a scenario

157
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,940
where you'd be helpful.

158
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,950
- Murder at a Cinnabon.
Who would you call?

159
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,860
- Someone who wouldn't
be distracted by the frosting.

160
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,650
- Yeah, I do love
that frosting.

161
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,560
- Hey Diaz, heard you guys
needed help

162
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,220
from some real heroes.
- Please.

163
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,870
- Firefighters are basically
just EMTs who all live together

164
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,560
and sleep in bunk beds.
- Correction.

165
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,090
It's a professional,
multi-tiered,

166
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,360
shared sleeping set-up.

167
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,660
- You're describing bunk beds.

168
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,830
Just get the people
out of the elevator.

169
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,800
- We should have all ambulances
on call.

170
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,710
I want an open line
of communication with DOT,

171
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,270
and I want someone
from the DA down here

172
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,760
so we don't get cases
thrown out.

173
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,670
I need a pair of sweatpants,
and check again

174
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,100
on that status update from ESU.

175
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,280
All right, go go go!

176
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,770
- What do you need
the sweatpants for?

177
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,680
- My water just broke,
which reminds me,

178
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,850
we should be prepared
to distribute

179
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,940
emergency water and food.

180
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,550
- Your water just broke?

181
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,300
- We need to go to a hospital
right now.

182
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,470
I don't want a burst happening
around me.

183
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,560
It's way too gross.

184
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
- I'm nowhere near
giving birth.

185
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,870
I haven't even lost
my mucus plug.

186
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,560
- Amy, you need to get
the out of here.

187
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,120
- I'm sorry my baby
grosses you out, Rosa.

188
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,820
- I'm excited to meet your baby
when it's clean

189
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,390
and wearing clothes,
and not blasting out of you

190
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,090
like some half-Cuban
Jimmy Neutron.

191
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,650
- I'm just at the start
of my labor.

192
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,660
I haven't even had my first

193
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,840
contrac—

194
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,530
—tion.
- Was that a contraction?

195
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,840
- No.

196
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,670
That was just a crazy yawn.

197
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,540
Fine, look—
I don't have to go

198
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,760
to the hospital
until my contractions

199
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,190
are three minutes apart
and last

200
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,720
for at least 45 seconds.

201
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,540
- Yeah, but don't you need to
go home and pack some stuff?

202
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,110
I'll be fine.

203
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,470
Scully, you have a hospital
go-bag at your desk, right?

204
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,210
- Yep, what do you need?
One-day, three-day, coma kit?

205
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,860
- I rest my case.

206
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,470
- Peralta, you there?
- Yeah, what's up?

207
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,470
- You gotta get back here
right now.

208
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,470
Amy's water broke.

209
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,470
- What?
- What?

210
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,120
- When?
- When?

211
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,520
- Did she lose her mucus plug?
- Did she lose her mucus plug?

212
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,690
- I can't believe you're
making me say this, but

213
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,130
she thinks she lost
her mucus plug yesterday,

214
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,780
but mistook it
for normal discharge.

215
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,750
- How thick was it?
Was it clear or milky?

216
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,530
- Was it bloody?
Was it "the bloody show?"

217
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,350
- Jake, I think it's very cool
that you've learned this,

218
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,710
very progressive.
Charles, I think you know

219
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,710
you crossed a line.

220
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,140
Just get back here, now!

221
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,440
- Copy.
- This is it.

222
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,800
My purpose is clear.

223
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,320
I was put on this Earth

224
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,450
to get you back in time
to see your baby's birth.

225
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,460
- I mean, you're a grown man
with your own hopes and dreams.

226
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,680
- My purpose is clear.

227
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,500
- Okay.
- Excuse me,

228
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,860
my apartment is
on the seventh floor,

229
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,250
and the elevator
isn't working.

230
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,640
I'm getting cold.

231
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,250
- Well, we're headed back
to our precinct.

232
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,900
There's emergency power
if you want to wait there

233
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,430
for the lights
to come back on.

234
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,730
- I'll get in back.

235
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,180
- I'm Dorothy, but my friends
call me Dotty.

236
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,740
Although these days there
are fewer and fewer of them.

237
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,130
- Charles?
Uh, this is great, Dotty,

238
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,570
but we're kind of in a hurry.

239
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,870
My wife just went into labor
and I want to get there

240
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,440
in time for the birth.
- Why?

241
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,700
The only man in the room
should be the doctor.

242
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,670
- Okay.
- All the dad needs to do

243
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,150
is to make the money
and have a nice, thick belt

244
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,150
for when it's time to teach
him a lesson.

245
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,930
- My dad hit me with a belt.

246
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,490
Soon as I got big enough,

247
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,630
I shot him.

248
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,760
- Wow, what a fun group
for this,

249
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,670
the most important day
of my life.

250
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,290
- Don't worry,
fire department's on the job.

251
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,460
- Hear that, Jeffords?
We're gonna die in here.

252
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,340
We're marked for death!

253
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,300
- Okay, calm down,
I have an idea.

254
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,470
When my parents would fight
and my dad got scary,

255
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,390
I would take
my little brother upstairs

256
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,740
and to distract him,

257
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,520
I'd teach him dance moves.

258
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,400
- What kind of dance moves?

259
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,660
- Mostly '80s hip-hop.

260
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,880
He loved Salt-N-Pepa.

261
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
- No, I won't be doing that.

262
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,320
Salt and pepper,
you say?

263
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,540
- Ugh, we haven't moved.
Why is there so much traffic?

264
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,500
Stupid Uber, New York used to
be a paradise of open road.

265
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,460
- Try the siren again.

266
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
- In my day,
people respected police.

267
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,510
- They respect us;
they just have nowhere to go.

268
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,250
- God knows they won't go back
to their own country.

269
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,510
- Dotty, I really wish you
weren't such a big part

270
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,340
of my son's birth story.
- We should walk.

271
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,300
It's only 27 blocks,
it's gotta be faster than this.

272
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,830
I mean,
it's a little bit faster.

273
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,390
- Is it? Hey, Dotty,
just weighing our options here.

274
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,260
Have you ever been worn
like a backpack?

275
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,480
- Okay, okay, you take the perp
back to the precinct.

276
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,960
I'll stay here with her,
- Are you sure?

277
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,390
- Just remember
to tell your son

278
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,530
what Chee-Chee
did here tonight.

279
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,660
- How you feeling
about Chee-Chee

280
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,790
having said it out loud
a few times?

281
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,970
- I am loving it!

282
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,620
- Help, help!

283
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,010
- Jake, we don't have time.
We'll call it in.

284
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,370
Let someone else handle it.

285
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,850
- No, we can't ignore
a cry for help.

286
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,370
We can handcuff him
to the railing

287
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,720
Dotty, call out
if you need anything.

288
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,720
- I'd feel safer
if you just shot him.

289
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,800
- Dotty, no.

290
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,720
We're not gonna shoot him!

291
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,630
- Hey, what's the update
from OEM

292
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,860
about the power
coming back on?

293
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
- Yeah, they're working on it.
So, listen,

294
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,250
I've been timing
your contractions.

295
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,470
- What?
How?

296
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,030
I've been hiding them so well.

297
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,430
- No, you have not.

298
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,950
- There's too much
radio chatter.

299
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,560
Let's try to keep non-emergency
communications down to a—

300
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,870
minimum.

301
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,430
- They're happening
every five minutes

302
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,310
and they're lasting 20 seconds.
Your baby's coming.

303
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,830
- It's still not active labor.

304
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,790
Don't worry!
I'm not gonna have the baby

305
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,660
here and get placenta
all over your desk

306
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,050
or whatever it is
that you're afraid of.

307
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,930
- Wait, is placenta something
that can get all over?

308
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,410
- Actually, technically—

309
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,840
- You know what, don't answer
that, I don't wanna know.

310
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,880
- I promise I will go
to the hospital as soon as—

311
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,450
- Amy, just make the noise.
You're not fooling anybody.

312
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,900
- NYPD, you called for help?

313
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,770
- Yes, my neighbor fell
down the stairs.

314
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,330
I think he hit his head
real bad.

315
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,690
- Ah. It's a concussion,
for sure.

316
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,910
- All right, we'll bring him
with us to the precinct.

317
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,260
Someone can help him there.

318
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,560
- That'll slow us down.
- Yeah, but we should

319
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,430
still make it as long as
nothing else goes wrong.

320
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,300
- Oh, fun.
Loud gunshots.

321
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,920
- What happened?
- She shot me!

322
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,400
She shot me in the leg.

323
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,660
- You made a sudden motion.
- I sneezed!

324
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,830
- Okay, Dotty,
what do you have a gun for?

325
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,930
- To protect myself.

326
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,930
- Cops are all wimps now.

327
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,410
My wife is having a baby

328
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,630
and I have to be there
to brush her hair.

329
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,460
- I wasn't gonna
brush her hair.

330
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,810
- You weren't?

331
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,720
- All right, look,
Dotty, you're under arrest.

332
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
- Jake, we gotta go.
- I can't walk on this leg.

333
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,330
- Great, then we're stuck here.

334
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,460
We're never gonna make
it back to the precinct.

335
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,470
- Yeah we are.
I have an idea.

336
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,730
- Pedal Pub coming through!
- I'm on my way, Amy!

337
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,920
- Thanks for letting us hijack
your bachelorette party.

338
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,400
- Oh, it's what we do.

339
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,090
We're, like, so random.

340
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,060
- Yeah, in Red Bank,
where we're from,

341
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,010
everyone's like,
"Uh-oh, here comes trouble."

342
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,400
- Wait, we have to stop.

343
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,060
- No, no, no—no stopping.
Why are we stopping?

344
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,930
- I lost both my shoes
back there.

345
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,890
I gotta go find them.

346
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,020
Update.

347
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,800
I still have one shoe on,

348
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,240
but I think I broke my ankle.

349
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,980
But I'm gonna still try
to find the other one.

350
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,900
- Guys, this is taking
way too long.

351
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,550
When she gets back,
we have to pedal faster.

352
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,420
- Sorry, I have a gunshot wound
in my leg.

353
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,600
- It didn't even hit bone,
you sissy.

354
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,380
- Oh, if you're in pain,
here have some of this.

355
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,950
It's bubblegum flavored gin.

356
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,470
- I can't.
I'm two years sober.

357
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,000
- What? No you're not.
You got drunk

358
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,480
and crashed
into the power plant.

359
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
- Yeah, that was a relapse.
I fell off the wagon.

360
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,270
- Okay, so you're clearly
lying, which means...

361
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,920
you planted
the bottle of vodka.

362
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,570
- Which means the crash
wasn't an accident.

363
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,140
- And you caused the blackout
on purpose, why?

364
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,270
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

365
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,830
I just drank too much
and that was—

366
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,010
She's fingering my wound!

367
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,240
- Tell us what you're up to.

368
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,590
- The banks! We're hitting
all the banks on Union.

369
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,630
- Dotty, stop.
- Please let go.

370
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,850
- Dotty, that's
against the law.

371
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,200
- I am the law.

372
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,420
- What made you like this?

373
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,850
All right, Charles.
We gotta stop them.

374
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,330
- We can't.
That's in the wrong direction.

375
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,110
That's away from Amy.
- But it's near the hospital.

376
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,600
We can pedal down there,
stop the robberies,

377
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,990
and then I'll meet her
at First Presbyterian.

378
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,470
That's perfect.
- Okay,

379
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,300
so I didn't find my other shoe,
but I did meet Luis.

380
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,130
He told me he's Aquaman.

381
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,480
- Bit of a stretch,
but welcome to the team, Luis!

382
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,830
Let's do it!

383
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,050
- Okay, your contractions
are three minutes apart.

384
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,350
It's officially time to go
to the hospital.

385
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,650
- Not yet.

386
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,440
- Do you know how thin
your cervix is right now?

387
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,260
Yeah, I'm worried, so I started
reading the book

388
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,570
I found on Jake's desk.

389
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,020
I do not want to be around
when page 53 happens!

390
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,280
- Hank wants to know
if we can cut emergency power

391
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
to the third floor.

392
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,490
Let me talk to him.

393
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,500
- Hey!

394
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,670
If you page 53 in front me,

395
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,320
our relationship
will never be the same.

396
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,160
- Make sure you don't look
at page 214.

397
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,030
- What?
Why?

398
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,420
- Mosey forward,
name in lights, butt pop.

399
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,110
Comb your hair.

400
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,080
Now typing motion,
pull it back.

401
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,040
Jump forward,
pelvic pump.

402
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,340
- You got it!

403
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,030
Now, all we need to do
is run it all together

404
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,040
and do it at full speed.

405
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,120
- I must say, Jeffords,

406
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,480
this dancing
is quite distracting.

407
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,130
I've completely forgotten
that we're trapped here

408
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,390
in this death box

409
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,610
inspected by Bozo Beverly
between clown shows.

410
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,520
- You know what, sir?
I don't think

411
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,620
you are thrusting
your butt enough

412
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,360
before the name in lights.

413
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,710
- Yes, yes.
I felt that.

414
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,270
God, I love that note.

415
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,060
Back to the top.

416
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,360
I'll count us in.
Five, six, seven, eight.

417
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,060
- NYPD, put your hands
in the air!

418
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,550
You're under arrest.
We'll read you your rights

419
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,580
on the Pedal Pub.
Charles?

420
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,550
Come on, put on the zip-ties.
Move, move, move!

421
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,330
- Hey, what's taking so long?

422
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,030
- Look, I can do it safely
or I can do it quickly.

423
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,550
- Do it quickly.
- Oh, I can't do it quickly.

424
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,390
You called my bluff.

425
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Oh, the lights are on.

426
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,040
- ♪ Spank that bottom
spank that bo— ♪

427
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,560
We will never speak
of this again.

428
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,350
- Status update: I called
in every officer I could.

429
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,130
I green-lit
double shifts and overtime.

430
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,100
We're coordinating with the 9-6
on traffic control.

431
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,710
We haven't processed anyone,
so there's a backlog of perps

432
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,750
on the third floor,

433
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,700
and I have to go
to the hospital

434
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,140
because my water broke.

435
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,240
- You're having a baby?
Amy, this is so wond—

436
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,330
- We can just catch up
after the baby comes.

437
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,200
- Wait, wait, wait, stop!
The power's back.

438
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,110
- Oh, yuck, none of you are
cute with the lights fully on.

439
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,600
- You wanna play
mean girl, Kayla?

440
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,120
Two can play at that game.
Let's talk about your bangs.

441
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,340
- Charles, not now,
I'm calling Amy.

442
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,340
- Jake?
- Hey, Ames,

443
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,730
I'm so sorry we're
not there yet,

444
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,040
but a guy fell down the stairs,

445
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
and then the old lady
shot a perp

446
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,440
and then we stopped
a bank robbery—

447
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,080
- And I lost my shoe.
- And Kayla lost her shoe,

448
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,310
but we're almost
to the hospital.

449
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,440
Are you there yet?
What room are you in?

450
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,610
- The break room.

451
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,130
- What?
Why?

452
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,530
- There isn't enough time.
I have to have the baby here.

453
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,010
- But me and my crazy crew
made it to the hospital.

454
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,400
That's our birth story!

455
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,660
- Screw your birth story,
just get here!

456
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,060
- You're giving birth
at the precinct?

457
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,190
Is that safe?
- It's gonna be okay.

458
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,630
There's a bunch
of firefighters here.

459
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,190
- Right, and they're basically
just glorified EMTs

460
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,590
that live together
and sleep in bunk beds.

461
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,500
- Jake, she's gonna be okay.

462
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,680
I just don't think
she can talk right now.

463
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,110
- Okay, just tell her
that I love her

464
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
and that I'll get there
as fast as I can.

465
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,940
- Hey, Amy,
can we have a second?

466
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,950
- Joe, I'm kind of in the
middle of something,

467
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,820
you!

468
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,820
- Oh yeah?
Well yourself!

469
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,830
- All right, all right.
- Just come.

470
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,740
We have something to show you.

471
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,870
You made me a birthing suite?

472
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,970
- We've been napping at work
for 20 years.

473
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,930
We know how to create
a relaxing space

474
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:51,930
in a police station.

475
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,280
- Gurney.
- Fire blankets.

476
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,670
- Night stick for back massage.

477
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,630
- Soothing lighting.
- AKA Scully's fart candles.

478
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,930
- I'm sorry I said
you were worthless

479
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,150
in an emergency.

480
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,190
You two really came through.

481
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,630
- It's just nice to have a win

482
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,500
after what we
went through today.

483
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,940
So many deviled eggs were lost,
and for what?

484
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,720
- Hey, hey,
you can't focus on that.

485
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,510
There were hundreds of
meatballs that were eaten

486
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,200
because of you!
- I could've eaten more.

487
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,770
- Just one more!
- Guys?

488
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,080
- Not now, Amy.

489
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,640
- How am I going to get back
to the precinct?

490
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,000
This thing is way too slow.

491
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,820
- Not if we all band together
and pedal like hell.

492
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,220
- It's not gonna happen,
Charles.

493
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,830
Dotty's asleep,
Kayla's flirting with Luis,

494
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,610
and Briana's peeing
in a trash can.

495
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,960
That's illegal, Briana.

496
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,740
- Oh, you know you love it.

497
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,790
- I'm gonna miss
the birth of my son.

498
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,220
- No, you're not.

499
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,660
Look, I didn't want
to have to do this,

500
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,320
but there is someone
I can call.

501
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,840
- Who?

502
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,100
- Hello, Peanut Butter.

503
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,150
I know we don't see eye-to-eye.

504
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,320
But we gotta put that behind us

505
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,630
because my friend here—

506
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,630
- Charles,
the horse was a great idea

507
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,670
but we don't have time for you

508
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,850
to have
a heart-to-heart with it.

509
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,110
- Sorry, I'm just
very emotional, Jake.

510
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,120
Take care of my friend,
you four-legged bastard!

511
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,640
You know, now that I'm up here,

512
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,940
I realize I don't know
how to ride a horse.

513
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,170
It's probably pretty
self-explanatory, right?

514
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,120
- Yah!
- Oh, no!

515
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,090
Move! Everyone move, I don't
know how to ride a horse!

516
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,300
- Okay, Amy.
I know you're in a lot of pain,

517
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,870
but we don't have
any meds here.

518
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,260
You just gotta try
not to focus on it.

519
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,140
Can you distract her?
- I got this.

520
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,360
Hey, Amy, they come out
with any new binders recently?

521
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,010
- I don't want to talk
about binders, Rosa.

522
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:17,010
- All right,
that was my big gun.

523
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,010
She's just gonna feel this.

524
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,310
- Not necessarily.

525
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,710
I was just checking to see
if there was anything

526
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,930
we could do to help.

527
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,230
And I hate to say it,
but I think there is.

528
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,890
- Oh, you think he's gonna
get me drugs from evidence?

529
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,190
- Uh, no.

530
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,940
Something way weirder
is happening.

531
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,110
- Hit it, Jeffords.

532
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,860
♪ Ah, push it

533
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,770
♪ Ah, push it

534
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,340
♪ Get up on this
♪ Ah, push it

535
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,000
- I am definitely distracted.

536
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,360
- Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

537
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,140
- I can see the head.
Rosa, get over here.

538
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm gonna need
a second set of hands.

539
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,320
- No, no, no,
she really doesn't wanna

540
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,330
be down on that end.

541
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,760
- No, it's okay.
I got this.

542
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,760
I can close my eyes, right?

543
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,240
- Keep them open.
- Oh, damn it.

544
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,760
- Just keep pushing,
you're almost there.

545
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,120
- Oh, but Jake's not here yet.

546
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,420
- Yes I am! I'm here.

547
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,680
- Oh, Jake.
- I can't believe I made it.

548
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,850
I'm gonna see the birth of my—

549
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,420
We're on page 53!

550
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,990
Babe, we're on page 53.

551
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,030
I know!

552
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
- I rode a horse.

553
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,660
- Well, we did it, Ames.

554
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,960
We made
the world's hottest baby.

555
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,130
- Say cute, Jake,

556
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,230
- Nope.
This kid is liquid fire.

557
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,880
- Crazy to think that
in just 17 short years

558
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,140
he's gonna be 6'7"

559
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,800
and the number one draft pick
for the Knicks.

560
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,410
- Aw, and that he's gonna
pass up that opportunity

561
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,320
to pursue his true passion—

562
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,810
library sciences.

563
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,940
- Well the important thing is,

564
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,940
we'll support him
no matter what.

565
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
- Hmm.

566
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,980
- Even if he's
a huge, huge, nerd.

567
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,680
- Especially then.

568
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Are we gonna be okay at this?

569
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,340
I mean, this entire day

570
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,300
felt like a warning
from the universe.

571
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,340
I almost missed the birth,

572
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,900
we had our baby
at the precinct,

573
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,430
a firefighter
touched our child.

574
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,860
- You washed him off?
- Yeah, but I'll always know.

575
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,960
- Babe, we talked about this.

576
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Everyone balances
work and kids.

577
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,920
- Yeah, but everyone's
not a cop.

578
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,400
- True, but...

579
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,360
when our son wants to hear
about the day he was born,

580
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,840
we get to tell him that his dad

581
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
helped a bunch of people

582
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:33,930
and foiled a bank robbery.

583
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,020
- Guess that was kind of cool.

584
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,410
- And his mom managed
a city-wide emergency

585
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,720
while actually giving birth.

586
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,990
I'm proud for our son
to have you as a dad.

587
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,030
- Me too.

588
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,850
For you to be the mom.

589
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,730
I wasn't just agreeing with the
nice thing you said about me.

590
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,860
- I love you.

591
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,040
- Love you too.

592
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,820
- Oh, my God, he's beautiful.

593
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,180
Oh, Jake, he's got your face.

594
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,440
- Charles, meet Mac.

595
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,830
- Short for McClane.

596
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,220
- As in Shirley?
I love it.

597
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,880
- No, as in John,
from "Die Hard."

598
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,400
- I mean,
they're both incredibly cool.

599
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,570
Only one Oscar winner.

600
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,230
- Thanks for getting Jake
there in time.

601
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,840
- Oh, don't thank me.

602
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,800
The real hero is Lieutenant
Peanut Butter.

603
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,890
- No, it was all you, Charles.

604
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,190
Or should I say...

605
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,290
Uncle Charles.
- Chee-Chee.

606
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,410
- Don't ruin this moment
for yourself.

607
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,810
- Uncle Charles it is.

608
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,940
- How's he doing?
- He's perfect.

609
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,370
I see you changed.
- Oh yeah.

610
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,330
That other outfit had a lot
of afterbirth on it.

611
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,900
Also during-birth
and pre-birth.

612
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,980
The point is I burned it.

613
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,290
- Thanks for staying
by my side.

614
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,860
I know it wasn't easy for you.

615
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,420
- It was worth it.
I'm Auntie Ro-Ro.

616
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,470
- She gets to be Ro-Ro?
Incredible.

617
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,780
I've thrown seven years
away for this.

618
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,470
- Captain, Lieutenant,

619
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,300
the dance was great,

620
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,570
and it really helped,
thank you.

621
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,050
- Dance? What dance?

622
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,350
- She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

623
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,840
Mommy brain much?

624
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
- Captain Holt and I did
a hip-hop dance routine.

625
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,270
- Oh.

626
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,060
I see.
You know what?

627
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,320
I don't even care
that I missed it,

628
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,360
because right now,
I am holding my son,

629
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,370
and there's nothing
more important

630
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,500
in the world than that.

631
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,800
- I have a video,
if you wanna see it.

632
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,460
- Amy, hold this baby.
Rosa, give me that phone.

633
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,550
Give me that phone.

634
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,550
Everyone wash your hands.

635
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,550
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

636
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,810
- Fremulon.
