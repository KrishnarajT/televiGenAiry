Did someone find
my meatball sub?

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,340
- A, we would never have
a meeting about that.

What does that human blister

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,180
Does she intend
to demote me even further?

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,530
Or perhaps she'll transfer me
to the swamps of New Jersey

12
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,010
so I can patrol the sinkhole
where she was spawned.

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,840
- Or it's possible
the announcement has nothing

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,270
to do with you.
- Oh, good thinking, Peralta.

You're right.

16
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,580
Maybe Madeline wants to inform

I will give you $6,000
if the announcement

23
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,290
is she's a Cheuksin.

- Okay, everyone.
I have some news.

25
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,120
- That Madeline Wuntch
is a Korean toilet ghost?

26

Boring.
We already knew that.

The Commissioner's office
just notified us.

- Why would Wuntch fake
her own death?

46
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,520

Did he work on the movie?

the tickets destroyed,

Bloody Mary three times,

so I can write checks
all day long.

346
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,810
- Well, you know what?
Here's my watch.

347
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,600
- Yeah, melt this down.
- Enough!

348
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm tired of being stuck
in the middle of this.

349
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,340
You figure out who gets
the tickets and tell me.

350
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,480
That should keep them busy
for a little while.

351
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,740
- Hey, Jake, we've decided
how to settle this.

352
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,310
- We're gonna duke it out
in the ring.

353
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,050
- What?

354
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,570
- That man is lying.

355
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,360
I don't believe Wuntch
had another rival.

356
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,490
I saw it in her eyes.

357
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,530
She only had hate for me.

358
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,670
- Are you jealous?
- Of course I am.

359
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,670
I despised her
with my entire being

360
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,840
while she was only despising me
with a fraction of hers?

361
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,200
- Sir, you were doing so well,
okay?

362
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,590
Don't let this rattle you.

363
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,980
- Are you wearing sponges
in your armpits?

364
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,380
- If you have a better way
to soak up sweat,

365
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,380
I would like to hear it.

366
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,810
- Where are you going?

367
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,080
- To find out
if there was another man.

368
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,340
[organ music]

369
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,510
So, um, Adam is it?
- Mm-hmm.

370
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,690
- I only ask because
Madeline never mentioned you.

371
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,600
- Interesting,
'cause she mentioned you to me,

372
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,350
as a friend.
- Friend?

373
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,960
- Mm.
- I think you added an "R"

374
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,830
to the word "fiend."
- No, I'm sure it was friend.

375
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,610
I mean, based on context alone,

376
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,230
I wouldn't say somebody was one
of my closest fiends.

377
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,750
- Oh, you might.

378
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,010
We had a very
contentious relationship.

379
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,050
She never forgave me
for embarrassing her

380
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,490
in front of Derek Jeter.

381
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,180
- Well, I embarrassed her
in front of A-Rod

382
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,190
and J. Lo together.

383
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,450
- For 15 years I replaced
her anti-wrinkle cream

384
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,850
with sour cream.

385
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,980
- I replaced her Lactaid pills
with Tic Tacs.

386
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,720
Dead moron was crapping
her pants for months.

387
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,980
- She hacked into
my Netflix account

388
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,590
and watched
the "Lizzie McGuire" movie

389
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,150
on repeat to ruin my algorithm.

390
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,550
- She made me guard that doctor

391
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,380
who came back
to New York with Ebola.

392
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,730
- Sir, maybe you want
to keep it down.

393
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,640
There's people—
- That witch ruined my life!

394
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,000
She demoted me from captain
to uniformed officer.

395
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,960
- Eight years ago she had me
kicked off the force entirely.

396
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,650
You were not
her greatest rival,

397
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,480
and the proof is right here.

398
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,570
- Hello, Adam.

399
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,260
I may be dying

400
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,920
but I burned down
your cabin in Maine.

401
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,010
You were my one true rival.

402
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,230
- There you have it.

403
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,270
[dramatic music]

404
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,020
- I meant nothing to her.

405
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,670
That cockroach Madeline
was two-timing me!

406
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,890
- No sign of Holt anywhere.

407
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,980
- I know that's important,

408
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,890
but I don't think
I can just breeze past

409
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,030
the outfit,
"Sister Act."

410
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,380
- I sweat through my clothes

411
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,030
and I found this in the back
of a closet, okay?

412
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,380
Deal with it.
- You look great.

413
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,900
- Oh, there he is.
Sir, over here.

414
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,250
- Where are you?

415
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,210
Why are you holding
the mean yelling speech?

416
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,690
- Because I'm gonna yell it,
meanly.

417
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,170
I wasted half my life hating
that duplicitous hag,

418
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,560
and she didn't even have
the decency

419
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,950
to truly hate me back.

420
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,390
Well, screw her.

421
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,560
I'm gonna ruin her memorial.
- No, you can't do that.

422
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,570
If you read that speech,
you'll be fired.

423
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,920
- You're right.

424
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,050
And that would ruin my career.

425
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,920
And it's worth it.

426
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,060
I'm giving the speech.

427
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,670
- No,
that's what Wuntch wanted.

428
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,970
You're letting her win.
- Sweaty Amy's right.

429
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,930
If you really wanna
get back at her,

430
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,970
you'll team up with Adam

431
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,280
and give her a nice funeral.

432
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,060
- It's like
" The Durrells of Corfu"

433
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,240
when Prudence and Louisa
joined forces—

434
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,370
- To sink the catamaran
of the bookseller Yorgos

435
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,290
who wronged them both.
Yes!

436
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,200
I will team up with Adam.

437
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,690
Wow.

438
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,600
[laughs]
For a moment there,

439
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,210
I almost forgot who
the real villain was.

440
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,470
The woman who recently died.
- Mm.

441
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,390
- Charles, why did you
let Terry choose boxing?

442
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,040
- He didn't.
I picked it.

443
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,090
- But you'll die.
- Don't worry about it.

444
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,350
Boxing's in my blood.

445
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,040
My Nana Boyle boxed
in the Navy.

446
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,090
- I'm sure she did but—
and hear me out—

447
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,840
what if you're not as strong
as your Nana Boyle?

448
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,100
- I can handle myself.

449
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,750
She taught me
her signature punch;

450
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,180
the Strawberry Basket.
- That does not reassure me.

451
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,800
Hey there, big guy.

452
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,100
You sure you're feeling okay
about ending Charles' life?

453
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,110
- Yep, my girls
are gonna see this movie.

454
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,150
- Right, well,
before you commit manslaughter,

455
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,980
I do feel compelled
to tell you that the movie

456
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,640
only has a 38
on Rotten Tomatoes.

457
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,640
- Jake, stop yapping
and let them fight.

458
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
- I wanna see the big guy pop
the little guy's head off.

459
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,950
- Yeah, let's start the fight!

460
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,300
I wanna pop that
little guy's head off!

461
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,730
- You're clearly
the little guy.

462
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,900
- [laughs]
Good one, Jake.

463
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,170
- All right.
I guess this is happening.

464
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,820
Touch gloves.

465
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,650
[exciting music]

466
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,210
Charles, it's been very nice
being your friend.

467
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,780
Terry, I'll visit you
in prison.

468
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,920
And...
[bell ringing]

469
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,220
Fight.
- Strawberry basket!

470
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,660
[blow lands]
- [groans]

471
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,790
- Whoo, yeah!

472
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
You mess with Grandma,

473
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,140
you're gonna get the basket!

474
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,370
- Charles, you punched him
in the nards.

475
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,140
- Yeah, Nana fought nasty.

476
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,840
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like those tickets.

477
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,500
- I didn't hear no bell!
[shouts]

478
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,670
- [grunts]

479
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
- Jake, I think those
tickets are mine.

480
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,800
- Strawberry basket!
- [groans]

481
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,200
- Guys, stop!
It's a movie about cupcakes!

482
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,690
- You don't understand!
- You don't have kids!

483
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,120
- [crying]

484
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,550
- Wow, that speech
would have been amazing.

485
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,650
I had to look up what
a toilet ghost was.

486
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,130
- Uh, yes,
I took a trip to Korea

487
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,040
just to research
a new Wuntch insult.

488
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,340
In fact it's been a motivation

489
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,780
for most
of my international travel.

490
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,700
- Mm.
- So you guys are friends now?

491
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,700
- Uh, yes, it seems we have
a great deal in common.

492
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,180
- Well, one thing.

493
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,530
both: Hating Wuntch.
[both laughing]

494
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,490
I read him the obituary
I wrote for her,

495
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,750
but the "Times" wouldn't
publish it.

496
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,840
It had too many obscenities.

497
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,360
- And I read him
my all caps speech.

498
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,530
- And I loved it.
It was like poetry.

499
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,710
- Madeline smelled
like dog crap.

500
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,370
- Raymond convinced me the best
way to get back at Wuntch

501
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,110
is to make sure
he doesn't get fired.

502
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,670
Also I'm just gonna chisel
a penis onto her headstone.

503
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,980
- And I'm gonna watch.

504
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,380
[both laughing]
- Please take your seats.

505
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,860
- Well, uh, time for me to go

506
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,080
make a tear-jerker of a speech.

507
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,690
- Hey, I thought
of the best hashtag

508
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,340
to post with my photo
of the grave penis.

509
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,950
- I'm not on board
with that friendship.

510
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,430
- Yeah, there's something
weird about that guy.

511
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,210
Hey, when did he say
he got kicked off the force?

512
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,910
- Eight years ago.
- That doesn't add up.

513
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,130
He said Wuntch sent him
to guard the Ebola doctor.

514
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,780
Wasn't that six years ago?
- Yeah.

515
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,010
- Oh, my God.

516

Wuntch sent him
to destroy Holt.

517

- Good afternoon.

518
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,000
On this sad day,

519
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,570
I'd like to say a few words
about Commissioner Wuntch.

520

Madeline smelled
like dog crap.

I'm sorry.

true colors, Raymond Holt.

will not soon be forgotten.

Everyone who's anyone in NYPD

533
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,740

for your true self.

534

Your career is ruined, Ray-Ray.
- Who are you?

535
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,610
Why are you doing this?
- I'm Madeline Wuntch's nephew.

536
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,910
She sent me here to carry out

537
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,610
the final phase
of her master plan,

538
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,140
and now it's all over.
Wait, why are you smiling?

539
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,620
- Because, Adam, this isn't
the real memorial.

540

It's all a ruse.

I didn't know what it was,

545
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,490
so I had to be prepared
for anything.

546
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,760
This whole thing was staged.

547
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,110
None of these people
are real mourners.

548
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,940
They're not even in the NYPD.

549
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,070

- Worse.

550
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,680
They're members
of local improv troupes,

551
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,780
and they did it for
"the exposure."

552
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,430
- This has been a blast,

553
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,120
but we have to go start a flash
mob at the Freedom Tower.

Sit down.

- I have to hand it to you,
Adam.

557
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,820
You almost fooled me,

558
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,650

Great work all day.

after your little boxing match?

- My head hurts.
- I can't feel my strawberries.

568
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,150
- I meant more emotionally
and less groinally,

569

but listen, ever since I brought
these tickets up,

you guys have made my life
absolutely miserable,

571

but that ends now,
because I've made a choice.

We don't know how long she has.

It's 36 hours.

Stop lying.

of behavior

I'm not taking either of you.

Oh, man.

The kids are gonna be
so disappointed.

because they're going.

That's right,
I'm bringing all three of them

581

by myself
and you two don't get to go.

582
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,790
Your childish behavior
has led you to miss out

your lesson.

Wait.
He's taking the kids for us?

589

a free babysitter.

are so stupid.

- Yeah.

two fake memorials

I did.

Yes?
