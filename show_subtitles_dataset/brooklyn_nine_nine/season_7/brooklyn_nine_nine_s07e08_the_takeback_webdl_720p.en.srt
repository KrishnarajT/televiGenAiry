1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,380
- Peralta, you need
to come with me right now.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,900
- Can I eat my bagel?

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,330
- Trust me, you're not gonna
wanna eat before you see this.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,950
That's Shane Reed.
Suspect in a string of B&Es.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,080
Got pulled over this morning.
This was in his trunk.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,380
- Son of a bitch!

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,560
- Peralta... Peralta, calm down.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,960
- Why am I here?
I didn't do anything.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,700
- You broke into
15 houses, Shane,

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,220
but that's not what
I care about right now.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,090
All I care about is what
we found in your car.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,740
- I don't understand.
- He doesn't understand, Diaz.

13
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,270
Why don't you fill him in?

14
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,880
- "You are invited
to celebrate the wedding

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
of Katherine Joyner
and Douglas Judy."

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,410
Douglas Judy, AKA Doug Judy,

17
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,410
AKA, the Pontiac Bandit.

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,930
- Maybe.
- That's a yes.

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,620
Now tell me, Shane,
when did you get the invite?

20
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,110
- What?

21
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,460
- When did you receive
the invite in the mail

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,850
and how come I didn't get one?

23
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,720
- Why would you get an invite?
Do you know Doug?

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,240
- Hey, I'm the one
asking the questions here!

25
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,770
- Calm down, Jake.
Maybe it's a small wedding.

26
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,510
- Okay, good point.
How big is the venue, Shane?

27
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,770
I said how big is the venue?

28
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,260
- I—I—I don't know!

29
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,040
- I—I—I—I don't know!
But I bet you do know

30
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,430
the password to the wedding
website, don't you?

31
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,910
- Yeah, I guess.

32
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,470
- Well, then I guess you
better tell it to me, Shane.

33
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,650
You wash my back,
I'll wash yours.

34
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,260
- Wash?
- I meant scratch.

35
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,820
You know I meant scratch.
Now tell me the password.

36
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,920
- I think it's
"dougandkateforever."

37
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,350
- There, was that
so hard, Shane?

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,790
You did the right thing.

39
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,270
Now get this piece
of trash out of my sight.

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,230
Oh, is forever spelled out,
or is it the number four?

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,890
- Oh, it's spelled out.
- Okay, thank you so much.

42
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,930
Now get this piece
of trash out of my sight!

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
- I'm so glad you called.

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,130
Thanks for meeting me at
my favorite establishment.

45
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,910
- A place where
you paint pottery?

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,270
- I find a hand-painted mug

47
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,050
makes a thoughtful
gift for any occasion.

48
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,700
- So, what's going on?
Anything exciting in your life

49
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,190
that you maybe want
to tell me about?

50
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,450
- I got a new job.
I sit behind white CEOs

51
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,930
when they have
to testify before Congress,

52
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,450
so they don't look so racist.

53
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,970
Every 15 minutes I just
whisper some nonsense at 'em.

54
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,630
The texture
of quiche is unsettling.

55
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,720
I got paid $75,000
for that nonsense.

56
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,720
- That's cool, congratulations.
But there's nothing else,

57
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,990
you know,
maybe even more interesting

58
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,290
that you want to fill me in on?

59
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,160
- It seemed like
a pretty cool fact to me.

60
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,810
- All right, look Judy,
I know you're getting married.

61
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,820
- Damn it, I didn't think
you'd find out about that.

62
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,120
Who told you, Ronnie?
Bobby?

63
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,520
Ricky?
Mike?

64
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,000
- Don't try and change
the subject by tricking me

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,300
into singing
New Edition with you.

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,780
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

67
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,520
Ronnie, Bobby,
Ricky and Mike...

68
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,570
both: ♪ If I like the girl
who cares who you like ♪

69
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,220
- Whoo!
- So all is forgiven?

70
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,960
- No!
Why didn't you invite me?

71
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,360
- I wanted to, but a lot
of people in my life are crooks

72
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,450
and they think it's weird
that I'm friends with a cop.

73
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,750
They just don't understand.
Kind of like... parents?

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
- No, no more songs.

75
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,370
- Look, I'm having my
Bachelor party tomorrow night

76
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,630
and I want you to be there.
We'll make up a criminal alias

77
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,930
for you so you
can meet the boys.

78
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,240
- Obviously that's
a super cool plan,

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,980
but no, I don't want your pity.

80
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,590
- Suit yourself, but it's
gonna be one sexy-ass weekend.

81
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,510
- Like...

82
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,080
How sexy-ass
are we talking here?

83
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,950
- Private jet to Miami, baby!
- And there's a red carpet!

84
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,770
- Forget the red carpet.
Private jet!

85
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,560
- Yes, and a jet!
The jet is better.

86
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,080
Miami, here we come!

87
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,440
- Whoo!

88
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,830
- Today is Holt's first day

89
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,870
back in his office
and I wanna make sure

90
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,490
everything is just
how he left it.

91
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,920
Now, I can't remember,
was this little figurine

92
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,750
of Cheddar at a 45
or 50 degree angle?

93
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,620
- Terry,
it's a five degree difference.

94
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,620
You better figure it out.

95
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,980
- Ah, I missed this place.

96
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,760
Huh, little Cheddar's askew.

97
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,590
You really made yourself
at home, didn't you Jeffords?

98
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,410
But, uh... no matter.

99
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,070
Just glad to be here.

100
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,030
I am a captain again.
Back where I belong.

101
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,120
Everything is perfect.

102
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,600
Wow...

103
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,430
there's absolutely nothing
that could puncture my...

104
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,820
where's the business card?
- What?

105
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,430
- The business card
that was right here.

106
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,780
It had a piece of gum on it.
It's very important to me.

107
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,080
You didn't throw it away,
did you?

108
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,650
No, Terry would never

109
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,830
throw away something
that looked exactly like trash.

110
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,310
- Good.
I'll be back in half an hour.

111
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,740
Make sure it's
on my desk by then.

112
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,840
- Will do, sir.
I got it.

113
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,060
I'm on it.

114
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,280
I definitely threw it away.

115
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,060
- I want you to meet the guys.

116
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,930
This is Nathan,
Josh, and Chuck.

117
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,010
This is my buddy,
Sean, from prison.

118
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,410
- How's it going, fellas?

119
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,020
- I've never heard
you mention Sean before.

120
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,760
- Yeah, well like he said,
I just got out of jail.

121
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,980
Five years.

122
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,280
- Tough sentence.
What'd you do?

123
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,850
- Elder abuse.
Got my grandpa good, so...

124
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,470
- Damn, that's very upsetting.

125
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,640
- Damn straight it is.

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,900
- Elder abuse?

127
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,160
- I was trying to think
of something that

128
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,860
wouldn't inspire any
follow-up questions.

129
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,470
- Doug Judy!

130
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,730
- Cubes!
My man.

131
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,480
Sean, I'd like you to meet

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,960
the man whose private jet
we are flying on today.

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,220
- Yeah, you're Mark Cuban.

134
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,300
How do you guys
know each other?

135
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,830
- Doug came on "Shark Tank"

136
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,520
to pitch his idea
for the Smush Shush.

137
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,960
- It's a noise-cancelling
blanket for secret sex.

138
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,450
The product demonstration
did not go well.

139
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,490
- Robert fainted.
Anyway, enjoy the jet.

140
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,140
Just bring it back
in one piece, okay?

141
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,230
- No promises, Mark Cuban.

142
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,620
- I mean, we do wanna make sure

143
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,460
the airplane stays
in one piece though, right?

144
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,010
- Nah, I saw, "Flight."
If anything goes wrong,

145
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,630
fly the plane upside down.

146
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,190
- Oh, right, I forgot about
"Flight," the movie, "Flight."

147
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,070
All right, let's rip it up!

148
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,900
- What's going on here?
- Oh, measuring the space.

149
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,200
We finally got a work order

150
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,030
approved to fix
the outlet, so...

151
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,810
we can get
a third vending machine.

152
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,950
- What?

153
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,560
- A third vending machine.

154
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,210
- Why are you whispering about
getting a new vending machine?

155
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,640
- New vending machine!
- What model number?

156
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,910
- Oh, that's why.

157
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,040
- We asked you
what model number.

158
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,690
- I don't know, a normal one

159
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,000
with glass in the front.

160
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,610
- Seriously?
Did you even look into

161
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,170
the DiGiSnax 600E?

162
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,140
- I'd be into
a fancy machine, too.

163
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,140
I was just reading
about a Japanese one

164
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,920
that serves shellfish.

165
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
- We're not getting
a shellfish machine.

166
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,270
- Yeah, Boyle,
we're getting a smart machine

167
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,540
that suggests soda pairings
based on your chip choice.

168
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,190
- Or one with a make-it-wet
gravy feature!

169
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,190
- Okay, look.
Why don't you get a few options

170
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,200
together and then
I'll decide, okay?

171
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,590
At least Terry's not here

172
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,890
to try to make me
get a yogurt machine.

173
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,720
- What was that about yogurt?

174
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,370
- This jet is insane.

175
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,470
There's a private chef that'll
make anything you ask for,

176
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,820
no matter how expensive.

177
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,470
I just ordered
lobster enchanté.

178
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,120
- Oh, damn, what's that?
- I don't know.

179
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,470
I just said the fanciest
words I could think of.

180
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,640
- Oh, I'm gonna get
the Veal Prime Minister.

181
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,950
- Mm, that sounds good.

182
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,640
- Hey, you wanna
try out the Smush Shush?

183
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,340
- What?
You have one with you?

184
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,870
- I take it everywhere, baby.
- Yeah, there it is.

185
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,610
- Yeah.
- So it's noise canceling?

186
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,230
It's so heavy.
It's crushing my bones.

187
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,450
- Yeah, that was the Shark's
problem with it, too.

188
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,740
- I can't breathe.
Get it off me.

189
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,270
Get it off me.

190
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,050
- Yeah, you sound exactly
like Barbara right now.

191
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,970
- Disappointed in you, Jake.

192
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,400
- Pilot says we're
starting our descent.

193
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,100
- Then let's get changed, boys!
- Changed?

194
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,410
But these are
my coolest clothes.

195
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,930
I got them from
a targeted Instagram ad

196
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,370
after looking
at photos of Cam Newton.

197
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,980
- The outfit's beautiful,
but it doesn't really

198
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,590
say, "Miami."

199
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,590
- What does say, "Miami?"

200
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,890
- ♪ Come on, shake your body
baby do the conga ♪

201
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,900
♪ I know you can't control
yourself any longer ♪

202
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,030
♪ Feel the rhythm of
the music getting stronger ♪

203
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,780
♪ Don't you fight it 'til you
tried it, do that conga beat ♪

204
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,950
- Are you sure this
is culturally okay for me?

205
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,040
- We're gonna find out.
- All right.

206
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,260
- ♪ Come on, shake your body
baby do that conga ♪

207
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,170
- Damn, Judy,
this place is nice.

208
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,270
- Yeah, some Russian oligarch
got the penthouse,

209
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,270
but this is
the second nicest room.

210
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,790
- Surprise!
- Trudy Judy!

211
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,530
What you doing here?
I thought you were in prison!

212
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,620
- Nope, I was a real
sweet pea, so they let me out

213
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,360
for good behavior.
What the hell?

214
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,100
What's this NARC doing here?

215
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,630
- What the hell was that?
You almost blew my cover.

216
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
- Yeah, they're
all suspicious now.

217
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,810
You have to help us convince
them that Jake's not a cop.

218
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,980
- Why? I don't understand
why you invited him.

219
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,250
This was supposed to be a crazy

220
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,550
weekend of boobs and butts.

221
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,640
- Trudy Judy,
you're not gonna see

222
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,040
boobs or butts this weekend.

223
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,780
- I'll see butts
if I wanna see butts.

224
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,170
- And Jake is here
because he's my friend

225
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,650
and he really wanted to come.

226
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,430
- No, he's up to something.

227
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,920
He's probably here
to arrest Chuck.

228
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,700
- I would never arrest Chuck—
but, I mean,

229
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,870
why'd you say that?
What did Chuck do?

230
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,480
- Wow... cops always be copping.

231
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,050
- That's not true.
I do bad things.

232
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,090
One time I illegally
downloaded an O-Town album!

233
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,790
- Dang, that's one
of the hardest boy bands.

234
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,060
- Exactly, they're scary.
Look, I can be cool.

235
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,190
As long as nobody commits any
major crimes in front of me.

236
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,490
- It's not a problem.
We don't have to break the law

237
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,060
to have fun.
We gonna have some drinks,

238
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,980
smoke some Cubans,
eat a steak, either crazy big

239
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,240
or crazy small,
whichever's more expensive.

240
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,760
- I'd rather see butts.

241
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,860
- Fine, if I let you see butts,

242
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,770
will you convince the guys
that Jake's not a cop?

243
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,810
- How many butts
are we talking?

244
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,810
- Six.
- Ten.

245
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,080
- Seven.
- Nine.

246
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,820
- Fine, eight,
I'll meet you in the middle.

247
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,080
- Nah, you waited too long.
Now it's up to 14.

248
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,820
- 14 butts!
- She's a grown woman.

249
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,300
Just let her see butts, man.
- Thank you, Jake.

250
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,130
Thank you for coming
to my aid on the butt thing.

251
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,430
One step closer to trust.
Now I'ma go out there and help

252
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,310
your fedora-wearing
Jason Mraz-looking ass, okay?

253
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,140
- I think I look like
Andy Garcia in this hat.

254
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,660
- You look like Seth Green.
- Seth Green?

255
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,270
- No, Tom Green.
- Tom Green.

256
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,140
- You're thinking of Tom Green.
- Tom Green?

257
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,010
No, go back to Jason Mraz.

258
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,360
- Okay, so Holt's gum-covered
business card is long gone.

259
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,530
But I have a plan.

260
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,150
- Great, what's the scheme?

261
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,190
- Well, when I first moved in,
I took a couple selfies

262
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,680
to commemorate
getting my own office.

263
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,770
- A couple?
- Oh, please.

264
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,240
Like you don't
have any selfies.

265
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,540
Let me see your camera roll.

266
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,380
Zero photos?
That's so much weirder!

267
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,120
- Thank you.
- Anyway, look.

268
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,120
If you zoom in enough,
you can see the business card.

269
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,340
We can recreate it
and print a new one!

270
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,080
- Wait, does that
say "Zeff Wilcox"?

271
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
- Zeff?
No, it's probably Jeff.

272
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,130
You know,
like a normal human name.

273
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,260
- Names are all made up.

274
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,170
There's no such
thing as a normal name.

275
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,530
"Terry."

276
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,270
- I am not putting
"Zeff" on that card.

277
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,530
- It's your funeral.

278
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,790
- Have you found
my business card?

279
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,620
- Uh... you know what,

280
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,840
I actually brought
it home by accident.

281
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,930
I got confused because
I know someone with that name.

282
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,840
- You know another Zeff?

283
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,150
- Yeah, he's married
to Sharon's friend, Zudy.

284
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,370
We have dinner with
Zeff and Zudy once a month.

285
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,020
You know, I'm gonna
go home and get it.

286
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,160
Excuse me.

287
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,070
- I think they swing.

288
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,770
- So in the end, it's more
than a vending machine.

289
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,940
It's a vending experience.

290
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,080
- A vending experience that
serves fried octopus balls?

291
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,560
- It also serves eel balls
and clam balls and...

292
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,660
it's really just
the three kinds of balls.

293
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,000
- Oh, okay.
On that horrifying note,

294
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
Scully and Hitchcock,
it's your turn.

295
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,700
- Allow me to introduce
you to the Q3400.

296
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,580
She's got it all.
Chips, candy, soda,

297
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,100
and a whole lot of class.

298
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,620
- That sounds great
for snacking, but what if

299
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,230
I'm stuck working late
at the office?

300
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,580
- How about a personal-sized
frozen pizza?

301
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,230
- And then what?
I have to carry it

302
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,850
all the way over to
the microwave on my own?

303
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,460
Who has the time?

304
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,890
- Well, you're
in luck, because...

305
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,900
- I get it!
It cooks the pizza for you.

306
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,380
- It cooks the pizza for you.

307
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,770
both:
♪ And you know

308
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,900
- ♪ It ain't fiction

309
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,770
- ♪ Just a natural fact

310
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,940
- ♪ Ooh
We come together ♪

311
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,820
both:
♪ 'Cause opposites attract

312
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,050
- No applause?
Wow.

313
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,570
- I'm still just
a little confused.

314
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,830
Who is Sean, really?

315
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,000
Why'd your sister
say he was a NARC?

316
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,270
Is he a cop?
- He's not a cop.

317
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,750
He caught me
cheating on my boyfriend

318
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,880
and he snitched.
It was a real dick move,

319
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,180
but I have since forgiven him.

320
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,450
- It's just weird
that none of us have

321
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,800
ever heard of him before.

322
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,280
- And we're paranoid
because Doug still has

323
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,670
that copy friend in the NYPD.

324
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,890
- That dude is not my friend.
- Yeah.

325
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,450
- He dumb as hell.
- Yeah.

326
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,150
- I'm always tricking him.
- Well, not every time.

327
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,840
- Plus, he's short.
- Everyone's short to you.

328
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,150
You're a giant.
- Probably never even had sex.

329
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,680
- Seems unlikely.
He's an adult.

330
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
But the point is, I'm Sean.
Tall Sean.

331
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,600
- Okay, well I'm glad
to hear you're not a NARC,

332
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,900
'cause it'd have
been real awkward

333
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,200
considering what
we did earlier.

334
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,640
- Huh?

335
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
- While you were checking in,
we stole $10 million

336
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,510
worth of diamonds
from that rich Russian dude

337
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,820
in the penthouse!

338
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,040
- Bling, bling, baby!

339
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,390
- You idiots.
He's NYPD.

340
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,000
That's Doug's cop friend.

341
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,610
- Wow... way to ruin
Doug's bachelor party, Trudy.

342
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:23,000
What a buzz kill, right, guys?

343
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,630
- I knew it was
a mistake to invite a cop.

344
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,190
That's why you
should only interact

345
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,270
with people who
are exactly the same as you.

346
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,410
- That's a terrible lesson.

347
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,710
- Sometimes
things aren't lessons.

348
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,460
Sometimes things are
just messed up facts.

349
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,590
- Guys, relax, Jake
wasn't gonna arrest anybody.

350
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,330
- No, I definitely was.
- With what evidence?

351
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,630
The diamonds aren't even here.

352
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,940
- They confessed
right in front of me.

353
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,290
- Why would you pull a heist

354
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,590
in the middle
of my bachelor party?

355
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,210
- You pulled a heist
during my wedding.

356
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,290
- Shh—he's a cop, man.
Come on, chill.

357
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,470
- Judy.
- Come on, guys.

358
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,470
What are we gonna do?

359
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,290
- I say we tie this NARC up,

360
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,560
leave him to starve, and
disappear with the diamonds.

361
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,040
- Chuck.
- We're not doing that.

362
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,470
- Thank you.
- It'll ruin my bachelor party.

363
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,740
- That's your issue with it?

364
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,300
- I put a lot
of work into this weekend.

365
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,610
I got us all shirts
that say, "Doug's Dudes."

366
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,560
- Ooh.

367
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,920
- Sorry,
but what's done is done.

368
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,270
It's not like we can
put the diamonds back.

369
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,920
- Hold up, that's a great idea.

370
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,350
We pull a reverse heist.

371
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,580
Does the Russian know
his diamonds are missing?

372
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,060
- No, we swapped
them for fakes.

373
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,670
- Perfect, that means
he hasn't reported it.

374
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,320
No harm, no foul.
- Okay, wait.

375
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,190
I mean, obviously I love
the premise and I think

376
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,450
a reverse heist would make
for a great movie and I already

377
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,200
have the tag line, "This summer
there are takebacks."

378
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,590
- Love that.

379
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,150
- The poster would be you
and me back-to-back with

380
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,770
our arms crossed, but no,
I'm not onboard with this.

381
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,200
I'm a cop.

382
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,460
- And a cop's job
is to prevent crime

383
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,680
and that's what you'd be doing.

384
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,380
Please, Jake.
For me?

385
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,600
- Okay, fine.
'Cause it's your bachelor party

386
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
and only if I see them
put back with my own eyes.

387
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,350
- Yes! Deal.
Reverse heist, baby.

388
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,000
- The Takeback.
Coming this fall to HBO.

389
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,350
- It's a TV show now?

390
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,740
- Well that's where
all the best content is.

391
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,440
- So what do you think?
Which gum looks

392
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,000
the most like the one
from the picture?

393
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,050
- Two pink, too wet, too small,
too chewed, too smooth,

394
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,410
too wet, all wrong, too pink,

395
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,620
too fresh,
too dirty, too clean.

396
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,050
None of these work.
You struck out.

397
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,060
- We don't have any time.
What do we do?

398
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,190
- I don't know.
Pick one and pray.

399
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,020
- Uh... I'm gonna go with... you.

400
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,240
- Not that one.

401
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,980
This one.

402
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,020
- Hmm... it's a little
less pink than I recall.

403
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,380
But I suppose we exaggerate
the beauty of those we love.

404
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,510
It's good to have
you back, old friend.

405
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,380
- Can I ask why that
card is so important?

406
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,420
- Because of Zeff Wilcox.

407
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,560
He was a victim
in the first case I worked.

408
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I always want to remember him.
- That's nice.

409
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,300
- And the words
he wrote on the back.

410
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,050
- The back—say what, now?

411
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,700
- Why is this blank?

412
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,920
- I threw it away.
I thought it was trash.

413
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,880
I didn't know you kept it
to remember someone you helped.

414
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,270
- I didn't help Zeff,
I failed Zeff.

415
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,620
His case was never solved.

416
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,450
The words written
on the back were:

417
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,100
"Thanks for nothing."

418
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,490
- Oh, man, that's rough.

419
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,630
- I have held onto
that card for 30 years

420
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,460
because I always wanted
to remember what it felt like

421
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,630
to let someone down,
so I'd never do it again.

422
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,330
That card made me
the cop I am today.

423
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,810
Without it... I'm lost.

424
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,770
- Since this seems important
now, I want to be clear.

425
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,590
This is Terry's thing, I've
just been along for the ride.

426
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,340
- Rosa!
- Noted.

427
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,640
- So tell us how you stole

428
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,130
the diamonds, so we can
just reverse it.

429
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,560
- Won't work.
We took them from the luggage

430
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,040
downstairs, posing as bellhops.

431
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,430
It was a one-time opportunity.

432
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,660
- And now the fakes
are locked in the safe

433
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,400
in a bodyguard-protected suite.

434
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,440
- Well lucky for you, I have
a long past in heist planning.

435
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,440
It's how I proposed to my wife.

436
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,580
- That's a great story.
Makes me cry every time.

437
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,970
- Oh, thank you.
Well, I guess I'll tell it.

438
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,710
You see, once a year,
at Halloween...

439
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,010
I can tell that
I'm losing the room.

440
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,540
I'll just move on.

441
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,710
So here's how
our thing is gonna go.

442
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,460
Every hotel safe
has an override code,

443
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,150
in case guests
leave them locked.

444
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,590
That code is kept on
the concierge's computer.

445
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,590
Do you know who this is?

446
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,990
This is Matt Daniel,
the most popular

447
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,990
male ASMR performer on Twitch.

448
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,290
- ASMR performer?
- Someone who speaks real soft.

449
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,650
- I also crinkle paper.

450
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,910
- We're trying
to stream and the noise

451
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,780
on the eighth floor
is unacceptable.

452
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,870
- My fans can't
hear my mouth sounds.

453
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,480
- I'm so sorry,
I can't hear you.

454
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,830
- That's the point, Georgina.

455
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,350
- He says that's the point,
Georgina.

456
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,650
This is taking too long.
Make a video.

457
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,620
Tell your
25 million subscribers

458
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,360
to never stay
at this crap hotel.

459
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,660
- No, no, no.
I'll take care of it.

460
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,580
Let me talk
to my general manager.

461
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,880
- You better run.
- Matt, don't yell.

462
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,760
You'll strain
your beautiful voice.

463
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,280
- Once we hack
into the computer

464
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
and get the override code,

465
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,540
Trudy will put on a
housekeeper's uniform

466
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,070
and I will gracefully
hide in her cart.

467
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,550
I got it myself.

468
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,940
Then, after the Russian
goes out for the night,

469
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,850
Trudy will show up
for turn-down service

470
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,030
and I sneak out when
the guards are distracted by

471
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,260
Trudy's signature
sexy housekeeping.

472
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,170
- Trudy will then exit,
leaving me behind in the suite

473
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,690
so I can unlock the balcony
door for Chuck and Doug,

474
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,960
who are waiting outside
on the window washer's rig.

475
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,830
Chuck will bring the stolen
diamonds and I'll use

476
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,870
the override code to put
them back where they belong.

477
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,270
Then, we head down to the room
where we party like hell.

478
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,790
- Trudy Judy...

479
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,630
- It's exactly 14,
just like you promised.

480
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,500
- You did promise her butts.
- I know.

481
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,240
- Mmm... the smell
of fresh cooked pizza.

482
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,890
- Where are we?
Rome, Italy?

483
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,060
- Guys, you got
the vending machine you wanted.

484
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,940
You can stop with
the play acting.

485
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,420
- I don't think
that's scripted.

486
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,240
That's just them
talking about pizza.

487
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,730
- Yum, yum, yum.

488
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,770
- I shouldn't have pushed
for the fish ball machine.

489
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,560
I should've just played it safe

490
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,080
and gone for
the fish cake machine.

491
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,250
- So you don't think
the fish part was the problem?

492
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,870
- I don't.
- Well, at least they're happy.

493
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,960
Look at 'em.

494
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,260
- My pizza!

495
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,530
- You did it, Peralta.

496
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,010
You pulled off
the reverse heist.

497
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,100
This whole time
I thought you were a bitch...

498
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,840
but truth is,
you're actually that bitch!

499
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,580
- He is, isn't he?
He's that bitch.

500
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,970
- I don't know if I want
that nickname to stick.

501
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,410
- Ooh, I hope
my butts are back.

502
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,540
- I do not like how butts

503
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,930
have become your thing, Trudy.

504
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,810
You used to love horses.
- Horses have butts.

505
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,500
- Guys, it's not butts.

506
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,900
I'm so sorry, Doug.

507
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,030
- Miami PD!

508
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,330
- It's just those
three back there.

509
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,330
- Hand on the table.

510
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,690
- Jake, what the hell?

511
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,910
- Cops always be copping.

512
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,300
- Hey!
Hey there, friends.

513
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,730
I tried to flag down
your taxi as you were leaving

514
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,220
the police station.
It was actually funny,

515
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,220
'cause we made a lot
of eye contact,

516
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,480
but you just drove off.

517
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,090
Anyways, I'm here now.
We can go.

518
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,260
- You want us to take
you back to New York

519
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,530
after you got my
friends arrested?

520
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,920
- Nuh-uh,
you flying commercial, son.

521
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,270
- I hope you get a middle seat.

522
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,620
- I hope they charge
you for your carry-ons.

523
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,310
- I hope you sit next
to someone chatty.

524
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,750
- Someone going through
something real hard.

525
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,530
- I hope the pilot makes
an announcement during

526
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,150
the emotional climax
of the movie you're watching.

527
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,110
- Ooh, you nasty!
- Damn, Doug and Trudy Judy.

528
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,240
Look, I'm sorry,
but it was grand larceny.

529
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,630
I couldn't just let them
get away with it.

530
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,110
- Well if you were
gonna arrest them anyway,

531
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,150
why bother with
the reverse heist?

532
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,720
- It's like Trudy said.

533
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,280
We didn't have the diamonds.
It wasn't enough evidence.

534
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,590
- But we put them back.

535
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,370
- Yeah,
only because I was there.

536
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,770
Not to mention the fact
that I was fully complicit.

537
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,940
I could've gone to jail.

538
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,510
- Wait,
we destroyed your phone.

539
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,330
How did you call for backup?
- That was actually easy.

540
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,250
When Doug was distracted,
yelling at the concierge...

541
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,820
- Let me talk
to my general manager.

542
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,380
- I swapped out my
waterlogged phone for his.

543
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,950
- Damn, I would have noticed
that if I wasn't trying

544
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
to live in the moment and
not look at my phone so much.

545
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,350
- And then when I was hidden
in the cart, I called the cops.

546
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,910
- Mm, impossible.
I would've heard you.

547
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,570
- Not with the Smush Shush!

548
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,260
- This is Jake Peralta.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.

549
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,180
Foot cramp, foot cramp.

550
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,880
- First of all, how dare you!

551
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,140
Second of all,
would you call Barbara Corcoran

552
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,320
and tell her this
product is not useless?

553
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,670
- I don't know her.
I'm sorry that I betrayed you,

554
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,490
Doug, but I'm a cop.
I didn't have a choice.

555
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,890
We can still be friends, right?
- I don't know.

556
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,860
Did you even illegally
download that O-Town album?

557
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,730
- No.

558
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,120
- I bought it at their concert.
Came bundled with a sweatshirt.

559
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,990
- You make me sick.
- Disgusting.

560
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,680
- Doug!

561
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,080
Trudy!

562
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,080
Judy's!

563
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,860
- Hey, sir.

564
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,090
I'm sure you're
still mad at us.

565
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,520
- Just you, not Diaz.

566
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,220
- Okay, well,
I can't get that card back,

567
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,130
but I did bring you these.

568
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,440
They're business cards
of people you've helped.

569
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,310
One mistake did not make
you the cop you are today.

570
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,100
30 years of service
to the community did.

571
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,530
That should be your motivation.

572
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,190
I know you can't
remember their names, but...

573
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,710
- Alex Chen.
I do remember him.

574
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,460
36-year-old male,
carjacked at the corner

575
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,110
of 7th Avenue and 11th Street.

576
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,020
Had three siblings,
Alice, Arlene, and Anna.

577
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,990
- Okay, so you
remember Alex Chen.

578
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,510
- Yes, and I really helped him.
Perhaps he'll be my new Zeff.

579
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,030
- Welcome back, Captain Holt.

580
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,560
I'm really glad
we could help you with this.

581
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,340
- Oh, no, you're not gonna
just jump back in here

582
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,860
now that it all worked out!

583
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,220
- Thank you, Diaz.
- No!

584
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,390
No, thank Terry.
I did this!

585
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,430
Oh, I'm done.
You know what,

586
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,220
I did all of this.
This was all me!

587
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,700
This is ridiculous!

588
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,750
- We barely got to know her.
- And now we never will.

589
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,230
- I feel so bad for them,
but what do you say to someone

590
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,230
that's suffered
this kind of loss?

591
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,490
- I mean, it's kind of
on them for not checking

592
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,320
the voltage on a machine
that has a built in air-fryer.

593
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,010
- Don't blame the victim, Amy.

594
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,890
- Okay, guys, look.
I know this is sad,

595
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,580
but maybe everything
happens for a reason.

596
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,890
- What reason
could there possibly be

597
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,290
for the pain I'm feeling?

598
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,980
- Look, I probably
shouldn't be telling you this

599
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,680
because I know you'll abuse it,

600
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,550
but when there's
no third machine,

601
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,730
you can come
back here and do this.

602
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,560
- Everything
happens for a reason.

603
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,650
- Peralta!
You have to see this.

604
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,440
Guy got brought
in this morning.

605
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,920
Look what we found on him.

606
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,440
- Yeah, I get it, Rosa.

607
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,920
Every perp in the city
is invited and I'm not.

608
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,230
But I—wait a minute,
why is my name on this?

609
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,790
- 'Cause you're coming
to the wedding, baby!

610
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,580
- What's going on?
You're not mad at me anymore?

611
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,230
I arrested your best man.

612
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,540
- Just like I wanted you to.

613
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,500
I was putting on a show
in front of Trudy.

614
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,760
- What?

615
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,450
- Katherine, my fiancée,
doesn't want any of my

616
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,760
crook friends
coming to the wedding.

617
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,680
She's a federal judge,
how would that look?

618
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,330
- Okay, but couldn't you just
tell them they're not invited?

619
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,560
- Eh... that's an uncomfortable
conversation to have.

620
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,980
It was much easier this way.

621
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,950
- Oh, my God.
This whole thing was a set up?

622
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,650
- You wanted me
to find that invitation.

623
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,910
- Mm-hmm.

624
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,470
- You knew I would
never go on a trip with

625
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,780
a bunch of crooks
unless I felt unwanted.

626
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,170
- Classic negging.

627
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,920
- I bet you planned
to have your bachelor party

628
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,050
at that hotel because you knew

629
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,480
the oligarch was staying there.

630
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,040
- Hell, yeah, otherwise
I would've got an Airbnb.

631
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,660
- And as soon as your
friends committed a crime,

632
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,140
you banked on me
needing to arrest them.

633
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,880
- Damn right.
You're the most consistent

634
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,050
person in my life, Peralta.

635
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,360
I can always count on you.

636
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,710
But, there is one
detail you missed.

637
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,190
You never saw what
I was painting on the inside

638
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,490
of my mug at
the pottery place.

639
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,890
- "Will you be my best man"?

640
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,370
Judy, is this for real?

641
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,500
