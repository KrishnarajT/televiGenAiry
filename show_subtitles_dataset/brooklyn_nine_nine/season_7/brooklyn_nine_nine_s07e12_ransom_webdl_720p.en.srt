1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,760
- Can you believe this,
Scully?

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,380
Looks like we're
the only responsible people

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,250
who show up on time anymore.

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,860
- And they're always calling us
lazy, but where are they now?

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,990
I don't see them.
- They're not here.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,820
- But you know who is?
Hitchcock and Scully.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,860
- The oafs.
- The bozos.

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,680
- The—
- Idiots!

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,690
What are you doing here?
The building's being fumigated.

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,210
There were so many emails.

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,220
- There were?
We didn't—

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,610
- Lightweight.
- That's your takeaway?

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,760
- It just doesn't seem
like he should be that fast

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,550
for how big he is.
Gah, I hate Wario.

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,290
- Peralta, my office.

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,460
- Oh, Kevin's here.
And you both look so upset.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,290
Oh, no, did they stop
funding the arts?

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,730
- They did, but that doesn't
matter anymore.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,770
Nothing does.
Cheddar has been kidnapped.

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,610
- Someone took our fluffy boy.
- Oh, my God.

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,390
What happened?

22
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,870
- Well, Cheddar and I walked
to the bakery together,

23
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,430
we shared a plain scone.
Then we went to the park,

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,350
and I let him off leash.
He never came back.

25
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,000
- Someone took our fluffy boy.
- Right, you mentioned that.

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,660
Now, just to be clear,

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,310
you didn't actually see someone
take him, right?

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,880
So there's a chance
Cheddar just ran away.

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,400
You know like some dogs do.
- Cheddar isn't some dog.

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,760
He would never do that.
Someone took our—

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,410
- Fluffy boy, yes,
I understand.

32
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,020
- I need you
to drop everything.

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,800
Nothing in the world
is important to me as this dog.

34
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,370
- I wouldn't say nothing.

35
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,760
For example,
you and I are very close.

36
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,510
- We don't have time for this.
- Okay.

37
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,330
- In kidnappings, the first
48 hours are the most crucial.

38
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,420
- Right, and in dog years,
that's only seven hours.

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,940
- Why would you say that?
This is why everyone

40
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,770
prefers that dog to you.
- Everyone?

41
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,380
Okay, look, I'm just saying

42
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,770
that before we jump
to any conclusions...

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,650
We should consider the fact

44
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,430
that there's no actual proof
that someone kidnapped Cheddar.

45
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,600
- It's a text.
It reads,

46
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,830
"I have kidnapped your dog."

47
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,830
- I see.
Well, that seems

48
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,920
like pretty hard proof.

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,610
That's good.
Good proof.

50
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,520
- ♪ I said who's that mama
looking so cool ♪

51
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,620
♪ I'm that mama
looking so cool ♪

52
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,050
- Whoa?
- What?

53
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,530
Oh, sorry,
didn't see you there.

54
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,050
- Yeah, that was clear.
What's going on?

55
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,750
Why you dork dancing?
- A baby store in Dumbo

56
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,450
is having a contest
to win a Snoog.

57
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,060
- Who or what is a Snoog?

58
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,890
- Are you kidding me?
It's only the best roller.

59
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,500
It has the versatility
of Sporjule,

60
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,630
the safety rating
of a Fajerb,

61
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,730
and an even smoother ride
than the Kinderbuscht.

62
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,380
- Are you having a stroke?

63
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,770
- All the best strollers
are from Scandinavia,

64
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,990
where they don't hate people
for having children.

65
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,420
- I saw "Midsommar."

66
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,780
Those people have
their own problems.

67
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,870
- A Snoog is my dream stroller,

68
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,690
but it's way too expensive.

69
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,910
- What's the contest?

70
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,690
- It's an endurance
competition.

71
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,950
Everyone has to stand
with one hand on the stroller,

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,480
and if you let go, you're out.

73
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,000
Last person holding on wins.

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,090
- Sounds painful.
Can I come?

75
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,050
- Aww.
For moral support?

76
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,530
- Sure.
That.

77
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,440
- Okay, sir,

78
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,100
the kidnapper should be calling
with his demands any minute.

79
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,660
If we trace his location,
we can find your fuzzy boy.

80
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,150
- Not fuzzy.
He's fluffy.

81
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,710
- We don't know
what he is anymore.

82
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,140
He could be fuzzy,
he could be anything.

83
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,150
Raymond, he could be scruffy.

84
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,840
- Now you've upset Kevin.
I hope you're happy.

85
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,460
- Why would I be happy?

86
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,550
I clearly just mixed up
fuzzy and fluffy.

87
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,720
- "Just?"
You're fired.

88
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,370
I want your shield
and your piece.

89
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,990
- That seems a little extreme.
- Jake is right.

90
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,680
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Just suspend him without pay.

91
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,850
- Why did you ask for my help?

92
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,380
- He's calling.
- Sir, remember,

93
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,640
we need two minutes
for the trace.

94
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,030
- Two minutes, understood.

95
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,430
- So just keep him talking
and stay calm.

96
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,080
- Peralta,
I'm in complete control.

97
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,770
- Hello?
- Shut your damn mouth.

98
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm the one talking here.
- Then this is over.

99
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,520
- And he hung up.

100
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,950
Well, that could've
gone better.

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,740
- Come on, Terry.
You can pick up that paper.

102
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,920
No, forget it.
It's only a first offence.

103
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,610
- Is everything okay,
Lieutenant?

104
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,440
You've been groaning
all morning.

105
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,490
- I'm sore from my workout.
My muscles hurt so bad.

106
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,800
Look.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

107
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,970
- Come with me, friend.
I have exactly what you need.

108
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,460
Bone broth!

109
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,070
It's an old Boyle
family recipe.

110
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,070
I drink it after every workout,
and I'm never sore.

111
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,550
- Boyle, I don't think
we're maxing out

112
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,810
at the same weight
at the gym.

113
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,200
- Oh, Terry,
they're just numbers.

114
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,170
You'll get there.

115
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,470
- Hey, there you are, and oh,
my God what is happening?

116
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,030
- I've gotten mad,
and now I'm getting even.

117
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,950
- Okay, look, Sir,
I know you're upset,

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but you need to stay calm and
treat this like any other case.

119
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,520
I mean, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

120
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,090
but now is not the time
to go all John Wick.

121
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,610
- Who's that?
A friend of yours?

122
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,100
- I wish,
but he's not a real person.

123
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,660
He's a movie assassin
that goes nuts

124
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,220
when someone
messes with his dog.

125
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,230
- Then call me "John Wicks,"
'cause I'm about to go nuts.

126
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,190
- It's "Wick," singular,
and you already did go nuts.

127
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,750
It cost us the trace, remember?
Look, I need you to focus.

128
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,580
The kidnapper texted
his demands.

129
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,200
- How much does the bastard
want for my little doggy?

130
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,890
- Oh, that's just it.
He doesn't want money.

131
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,760
He requested all the files
we worked from May 2004.

132
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,510
It's a lead.

133
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,990
He's gotta be connected
to one of those cases somehow.

134
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,510
- Interesting.

135
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,590
You know what else
is interesting?

136
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,950
- Hmm?
- Grenades.

137
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,770
- Just please, stop it.
I'm gonna take Kevin

138
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,510
to the park where Cheddar was
kidnapped and look for clues.

139
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,040
I need you to stay here,
go through those files,

140
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,910
and put together a list
of potential suspects.

141
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,950
Can you do that?
- Okay, fine.

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,090
I'll go through the files.
- Great.

143
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,650
- You realize I can't leave

144
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,050
until you put
the grenades back, right?

145
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,920
- Oh, but you let John Wicks
have grenades?

146
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,790
- It's "Wick."
Singular.

147
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,180
Just put 'em back.

148
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,400
- Okay, Kevin, we need
to recreate your morning

149
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,540
and see
if we can find some clues.

150
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,230
- All right, Cheddar and I
entered

151
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,540
on the east side of the park
over past those trees—

152
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,060
oh, how he loved those trees.

153
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,450
Jake, I don't know
if I can do this.

154
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,240
- Yeah, you can do this,
I'm right here with you.

155
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,410
We're gonna get through it
together.

156
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
Now let's go.

157
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,330
- Oh, hey, Kev, bud,
couldn't help but notice

158
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,950
that when I said, "let's go,"
you didn't go.

159
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,340
You stayed here
and stared at that bench.

160
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,600
- Cheddar loved benches.

161
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,340
He'd run up to them.
Sniff their legs.

162
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,900
Paw at them with his—

163
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,340
- Paws, sure,
that's what you paw with.

164
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,030
- I'm sorry.
This is impossible.

165
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,430
Everything I see
reminds me of Cheddar.

166
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,690
The grass, the asphalt,
squirrels—

167
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,570
Cheddar loved squirrels.
- Oh, stop.

168
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,000
- He loves to chase them.
I suppose I should say loved.

169
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,270
He'd never get there.
He's like—

170
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,050
- Eeyh, Kevin, stop, all right?

171
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,920
We need to get over to that
gate and recreate your morning,

172
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
and if seeing all these things
is too much,

173
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,570
then just focus only on me.
- Okay.

174
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,270
- All right,
stare straight into my eyes.

175
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,580
- Very good, I will stare
straight into your eyes.

176
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,270
- Okay.
Oh, wow.

177
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,580
Piercing.
Huh, okay, so let's do this.

178
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,720
And we are heading to the east
gate, we're doing great.

179
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,150
- This is working.
I can do this.

180
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,550
- Here we go.
- I'm doing it.

181
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,940
- You're looking away.
- No, I'm not.

182
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,330
- Stop looking away.
- I'm not.

183
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,460
- Don't look away.
- But I see leaves.

184
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,990
- No!
- Cheddar loved

185
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,210
playing in leaves.
Didn't matter what kind.

186
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,640
Oak, maple, elm.

187
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,990
- Wait, I hate to cut you off,
but look what I found.

188
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,350
Security camera.

189
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,600
- Cheddar loved
security cameras.

190
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,040
- How is that possible?

191
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,430
- Oh, Rosa, there she is.
The Snoog!

192
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,610
Look at those sexy lines.

193
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,270
Oh, I just wanna get
behind that thing and push.

194
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,570
- Aw, man,
you're grossing me out.

195
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,100
What is Teddy doing here?

196
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,060
- Teddy?
- Oh, my gosh, hey Amy.

197
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,670
- Right, boring ex-boyfriend
Teddy.

198
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,410
Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, Rosa.

199
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,970
- What are you doing here?
You promised you would stop

200
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,630
showing up places
to propose to me.

201
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,320
- Quit flattering yourself.
I only did that four times.

202
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,070
Also, I'm taken now.

203
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,590
I got married, last year,
in the spiciest little city.

204
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,550
Phoenix.
It was very posh.

205
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,160
We served a flight
of large batch Pilsners.

206
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,590
I don't know if you remember,
but I love—

207
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,510
both: Pilsners.
- Yeah, we remember.

208
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,250
- Yeah, long story short,
we're pregnant now,

209
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,210
and I'ma—I'ma try and win
this sexy little number.

210
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,510
- Oh, God, is that
what I sound like?

211
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,740
- Yep.
- Excuse me.

212
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,130
Are you here
for the competition?

213
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,740
- Uh, yes, hi.
I'm Teddy Ramos.

214
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,220
Took my wife's last name.
Very brave.

215
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,390
- He's the worst.

216
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,050
- Hi, I'm Amy Santiago.

217
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,530
- I am so sorry,

218
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,620
but pregnant women
aren't allowed to compete.

219
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,100
Not after what happened
last year.

220
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,320
- Are you gonna say
what happened?

221
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,620
- It's part of the settlement.
We can't.

222
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,020
- Okay.

223
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,760
Well, uh, good news:
I'm not pregnant!

224
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,720
I just had a huge lunch.
- I'm so sorry, I just can't.

225
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,370
- All right,
I'll compete for her.

226
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,730
- What?
You will?

227
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,510
But I know you think
these strollers are dumb.

228
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,600
- They are, but I can't let
that boring bastard win.

229
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,250
- So we decided to paint
the baby room white.

230
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,770
- I mean, you used to have sex
with him.

231
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,560
- I know.

232
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
- Charles, this Boyle
bone broth is incredible.

233
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,300
I'm not sore at all anymore.
- I told you it works.

234
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,570
The Boyles used to drink it
during potato digging season

235
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,220
to keep everyone healthy
in the furrows.

236
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,350
- You know, I bet we could sell
this stuff.

237
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,230
- You really think so?

238
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,360
We can call our company
"The Bone Boys."

239
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
No!
"More Bone, Less Moan."

240
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,490
No!
"Workplace Bone Buds."

241
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,790
That's the one.
I'm registering it.

242
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,620
- Ewh, we can name
the company later.

243
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,670
Anyway, I know just who
to pitch this to.

244
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,710
My buddy who invented
Muscle Malt.

245
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,330
This is great!

246
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,720
- We're the perfect partners.

247
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,330
When it comes to cooking,
you got me.

248
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,590
When it comes to being ripped,
you also have me.

249
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,070
And you have
a little connection.

250
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,760
We're gonna be rich.

251
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,250
- Sir, we're back.

252
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,770
Find anything
in the case files?

253
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,860
- Yes, most of them were
useless, but one caught my eye.

254
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,300
On May 15th, 2004 detectives
arrested Frank Kingston,

255
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,730
leader of the 16th Street Gang.

256
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,130
Thanks to the testimony
of confidential informant,

257
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,740
Kingston served 16 years.
He just got out last month.

258
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,560
- And you think he wants
the file to figure out

259
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,440
which one of his guys
turned on him to get revenge.

260
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,440
It's a Vendetta.
- Vendetta.

261
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,880
- Sure.

262
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,400
- So now I know who the
sumbitch is who took my dog.

263
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,710
The only problem is,

264
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,710
I have no idea where
to find that sumbitch.

265
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,620
- Well, Raymond, I think we can
help you find that sumbitch.

266
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,110
Jake?

267
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,760
- Sumbitch.
We all got to say it.

268
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,670
Let me show you what we found:
A security camera grabbed

269
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,850
some footage of Cheddar being
picked up and put into a car

270
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,760
which was registered to
an anonymous shell company

271
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,640
on Dean Street.
We can be there in 15 minutes.

272
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,550
- That's weird.
It's sunny outside.

273
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,470
- Why's that weird?

274
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,210
- Because a storm
is about to rain down

275
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,640
on that punk.

276
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,430
- Oh, my God, I fell for it,
and I loved it.

277
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,300
All right, let's gear up.
Kevin, you stay here,

278
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,780
and don't worry.
We're gonna get your dog back.

279
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,920
- So we did not
get your dog back.

280
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,750
Unfortunately, he wasn't here.
No, no, no.

281
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,310
I think Captain Holt's
taking it really well.

282
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,400
- So we'll see you soon.

283
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,920
- Wow, five hours.

284
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,840
This is the most exciting
contest we've had.

285
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,710
Of course, the incident
last year was exciting,

286
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,670
but we all know how that ended.

287
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,190
- No.
We don't.

288
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,500
- Right.
Because of the gag order.

289
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,550
Are you sure you wanna
keep doing this, Rosa?

290
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,460
You really don't have to.

291
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,290
- My feet hurt a little, but
I can go as long as it takes.

292
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,590
- We're having a great time
back here.

293
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,770
I was just telling
my buddy Reggie here

294
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,900
about this great salsa
that I make.

295
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,460
It's so mild
you barely taste it.

296
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,160
- That's it.
I can't take any more.

297
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm out.
- Bye, Reggie.

298
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,210
I'll send you that article
about mailboxes.

299
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,730
- Please don't!
- Oh, my God,

300
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,220
Teddy is boring
people out of the competition,

301
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,480
and he doesn't even realize it.
Can't let him get to you, Rosa.

302
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,170
It's fine, I can handle boring.
We're friends.

303
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,830
- Ooh, guys,
you will never believe

304
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,180
who I saw at Bush Gardens last
summer: my neighbor.

305
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,960
Yeah?
Just walking around.

306
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,530
- The kidnapper said he would
call with drop instructions

307
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,500
at 8:00 a.m.
It is now—-8:01.

308
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,930
Cheddar's dead.

309
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,710
- Cheddar is not dead.
It's just one minute.

310
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,280
Perhaps the kidnapper's watch
is slow.

311
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,970
- Oh, dear God,
if his watch is slow,

312
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,980
there's no telling what else
this psychopath is capable of.

313
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,720
- Raymond, Cheddar is fine.
He's coming back to us,

314
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,590
and that is why I bought a new
GPS tag to put on his collar.

315
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,860
- Thank you, Kevin.

316
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,680
At least some of us
are thinking clearly.

317
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,860
- Yes, crystal clear.
In fact I bought 5 GPS tags.

318
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,990
One for his collar
and one for each arm and leg.

319
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,830
I'm going to make bracelets
to put them on,

320
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,250
and I'll never lose
my Cheddar again.

321
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,870
- Okay, a little unsettling,
but I like your positivity.

322
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,690
- Three minutes after 8:00.

323
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,530
This man is unhinged.

324
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,570
You said you'd call at 8:00.
- My watch is slow.

325
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,870
Put the files
on a flash drive,

326
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,790
and have your husband
bring it

327
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,270
to the 9th Street entrance
of Prospect Park at noon.

328
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,880
- My husband?
No.

329
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,570
I'm not involving him in this.
I'll bring them myself.

330
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,360
- I don't trust you.

331
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,880
I told you not to look for me,
but you did.

332
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,280
Send your husband
or the deal is off.

333
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,890
- Clearly,
we're not doing this.

334
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,450
- No, it's fine.
We can just alter the files

335
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,630
and give him fakes.

336
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,320
He'll never know.
- It's not that.

337
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,890
It's that I refuse to put Kevin
in harm's way.

338
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,590
- Understood,
but I think maybe I have a way

339
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,290
to put Kevin in danger

340
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,850
without putting Kevin
in danger.

341
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,340
Well, hello there Raymond.

342
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,900
It's me, Kevin!

343
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,780
- And I am
Detective Jacob Peralta.

344
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,870
- We didn't have anything else
to wear so we just switched.

345
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,650
- He understands.

346
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,740
- Okay, if we're gonna pull
this off,

347
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,170
we need to teach you

348
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,530
how to move, talk, and act
exactly like Kevin.

349
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,920
- In other words we have
a "Pygmalion" situation.

350
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,270
- Exactly, a "pig mailman"
situation.

351
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,880
- Raymond.
- It'll be okay.

352
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,310
- What'll be okay?
- Let's get started.

353
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,060
- Yes, let's get started!
- It's getting worse.

354
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,410
- Spot on, Kevin.

355
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,840
- Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

356
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,980
- Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

357
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,410
- No, you're too excited.
The warbler's a common bird.

358
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,980
- Ah.
- And then I said,

359
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,410
"Which 'Metamorphosis'?
Kafka or Ovid?"

360
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,460
- He loves it.

361
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,210
He loves it.

362
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,510
- So that's the joke.
Now, you tell it.

363
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,290
- Oh, okay,

364
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,430
so a professor walks in
to a rare books collection—

365
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,860
- No, you've ruined it.
Now it's not funny.

366
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,960
- Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

367
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,260
- Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

368
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,040
- Ugh, not excited enough.

369
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,960
They may be common,
but they're still birds.

370
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
- At the 92nd Street Y,

371
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,270
I had a wonderful symposium
on just that topic.

372
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,010
- That's it.
You're getting it.

373
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,570
- Ah, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool.

374
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,190
- Don't say "cool,"
instead say "indeed."

375
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,970
- Oh, indeed, indeed,
indeed, indeed, indeed.

376
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,930
It's weird.

377
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,280
Look, Raymond.
A yellow crested warbler.

378
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,060
- Yes!

379
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,980
That's the right level
of excitement for such a bird.

380
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,980
You captured
the essence of Kevin.

381
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,280
You've done it.

382
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,160
- Correction,
I've accomplished it.

383
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,810
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

384
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,290
- Indeed, indeed, indeed...

385
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,940
all: Indeed, indeed, indeed,
indeed, indeed.

386
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,170
- It's growing on me.

387
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
- Oh, my God,
Rosa.

388
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,130
I can't believe
you're still here.

389
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,000
And I can't believe Teddy
looks so normal.

390
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,300
- I'm 'onna win you that Snoo.
Slog.

391
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,530
Snat—whatever,
my brain is broken,

392
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,300
I haven't slept in 72 hours.

393
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,000
- You've only been doing
the competition for one night.

394
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,010
- I mean, you're allowed
to not sleep for other reasons.

395
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,970
- Okay, I got you a coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

396
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,010
Just need to put my left hand
on the stroller.

397
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,620
My right hand grabs the cup.
My mouth do the sippin'.

398
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,500
- What's happening?

399
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,930
- My broken brain won't talk
to my body, so I'm doing it.

400
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,150
Blink.

401
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,410
- Rosa, you don't
have to do this.

402
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,100
You can stop.
- Snarl at Amy.

403
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,280
Teddy and I
are the only ones left.

404
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,030
I'm 'onna win this

405
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,850
no matter how much he talks
about light rail systems.

406
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,160
- Ooh, you should ride the one
in Akron, by the way.

407
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,900
Very little noise.
- Oh, my God.

408
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,510
- Enough about light rails.
Let's talk trams.

409
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,030
Amusement parks get it.
- I can't, I can't, I can't...

410
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,340
If more cities adopted
amusement park...

411
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,640
- I can't, I can't.

412
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,170
Oh, put your hands
over your ears.

413
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,470
- Oh no, wait, Rosa!

414
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,170
- Hands are off.
We have a winner!

415
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,520
- Me?

416
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,650
I won a stroller?
Whoo-hoo!

417
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,010
- Oh, I see what I did wrong.

418
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,570
- It's okay.
Come on, let's get you home.

419
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,180
- Excuse me.
Amy.

420
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,480
You can have the stroller
for the right price.

421
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,920
- Okay, how much?

422
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,360
- Amy Santiago,
will you marry me?

423
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,970
- No!

424
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,360
- Okay, I'm approaching
the drop site.

425
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,540
I don't see anything unusual.

426
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,190
- We have eyes on you.

427
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,370
Just be natural.
- Indeed, I will.

428
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,070
Oh, look,
a yellow crested warbler.

429
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,590
- Very good.

430
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,110
- He's calling.
Wait, Kevin,

431
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,380
we didn't go over
how you answer the phone.

432
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,070
- There isn't time.
Just answer.

433
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,380
- Okay.

434
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,160
You've reached
Professor Kevin Cozner.

435
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,600
Please start speaking
when I finish this sentence.

436
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,080
- Pick up the book
on the bench and head south.

437
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,210
- He hung up.

438
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,220
And he had me pick up a copy
of "The Tempest."

439
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,910
- "Tempest?"
Oh, no, Raymond.

440
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,570
Do you know what's happening
in the park today?

441
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,440
- The Shakespeare Festival
which will be attended by—

442
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,050
- Guys, I'm in a sea of Kevins.

443
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,230
- Okay, between us,
I think we made enough broth.

444
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,580
- Did you edit the presentation
like I asked?

445
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,100
- You mean did I remove

446
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,530
the tasteful photos
of me stretching?

447
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,150
- They weren't tasteful!
You were in a thong.

448
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,540
All right, Muscle Malt Kenneth
is on his way up.

449
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,980
Hey, I just wanna say,
no matter how this turns out,

450
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,550
it was really fun
working on this with you.

451
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,420
- Aw, Terry,
it's gotta turn out well.

452
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,640
I invested $11,000 in it.
- $11,000?

453
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,070
It only costs 30 bucks
to make the broth!

454
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,640
- Yeah, but it cost $11,000

455
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,130
to buy the domain name
"workplacebonebuds.com."

456
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,560
I am all in.

457
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,610
- Boyle, why in the world
would you do that?

458
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,610
You are such a—
an amazing business partner.

459
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,130
Kenneth, I'd like you to meet

460
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,700
my amazing business partner
Charles.

461
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,180
- Hey.
- Hello.

462
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,140
I'm excited to see
what you guys have here.

463
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,620
- Well, take a sip
and feel the soreness

464
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,310
start to drain away.

465
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,150
- Mmm.

466
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,020
It's good.
Very tasty.

467
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,670
- Not only is it delicious,
it's high in amino acids,

468
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
and low in sodium.

469
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,460
- Well,
not exactly low in sodium.

470
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,070
It definitely has salt in it.

471
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,110
- Not in the batch I made.
I left it out.

472
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,680
Terry doesn't like
to get all bloaty.

473
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,030
- You left out the salt?
That stops the fermentation.

474
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,290
The salt keeps it stable.

475
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,600
- Oh, ah!
- God, what is happening?

476
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,340
They're all gonna blow!
Take cover!

477
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,470
- So, uh, do we have a deal?

478
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,650
- Still waiting
for instructions, over.

479
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,310
- Wait, we don't have eyes
on you.

480
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,740
- Kevin, do you see Jake?
- Yes, he's right there.

481
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,580
Oh, no,
that's a different gentlemen

482
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,480
wearing a handsome jacket.
Everyone is so well dressed.

483
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,400
- Peralta, head for
the north gate.

484
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,310
We're having trouble
finding you.

485
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,540
- All right, Professor, I'm
assuming you're wearing a wire.

486
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,100
- A what?
A—huh?

487
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,460
Ah, yes, a wire.

488
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,200
My husband asked me
to wear that.

489
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,200
- We lost comms.
Something happened.

490
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,640
Cheddar!
Uh, my fluffy boy!

491
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,460
I've missed you so.

492
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,200
- All right, put up your hands.
I'm gonna tap you down.

493
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,690
- There's no need for that.
I have the drive.

494
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,160
Just take it.
- Thanks.

495
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,690
I'm still gonna pat you down.

496
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,080
- Be my guest, but you're not
gonna find anything.

497
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,170
- Here's a gun.
- Whoops.

498
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,210
- And another gun.
- I forgot about that one too.

499
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,350
- So, the Professor's got
two guns on him,

500
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,260
and he's wearing a fake beard.

501
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,830
- Oh, please don't rip it off.
It hurts so much.

502
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,350
- I think the Professor's
actually a cop.

503
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,180
- Something tells me
I should check that drive.

504
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,310
There's a laptop
in the front seat.

505
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,710
Get it.
If these files

506
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,360
aren't the real deal,
you and the dog are dead.

507
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,360
- Oh, no need to worry.
Because everything

508
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,360
is on the level
and will be completely fine.

509
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,590
- Cheddar, go!

510
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,150
Go, boy!

511
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,320
- Hey cop.

512
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,850
- Would you like
to buy a laptop?

513
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,890
- There's no sign
of Peralta out here.

514
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,550
Did you hear anything
on the wire?

515
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,720
- No, it never came back on.
Do you think he's okay?

516
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,950
- Shh!
- What?

517
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,430
- Do you hear?
- Yes, I do.

518
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,730
That's the jingle
of Cheddar's collar.

519
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,080
- And that's his bark!

520
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,560
Oh, that's our fluffy boy!

521
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,920
Good dog.
Good dog.

522
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
- Oh, Mr. Cheddar,
how I've missed you.

523
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,650
- We both have.

524
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,220
- I'm putting that GPS tag
on your collar immediately.

525
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,750
Oh, damn it, it's not here.
I'm wearing Peralta's pants.

526
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,440
Ugh,
and now my hands are sticky.

527
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,490
- Wait, Peralta's wearing
your pants which means—

528
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,230
- He doesn't have sticky hands.
- Yes, but also

529
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,630
he has the GPS tracker.

530
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,110
- Hey, so, given the fact that
you haven't slept in forever,

531
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,760
I feel
like I should drive you home.

532
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,200
- I'm not going home.
I'm going out.

533
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,890
- What?
Really?

534
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,420
What is your life?
- It's pretty good actually.

535
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,940
- Huh.
- By the way,

536
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm sorry that I didn't win you
that stroller.

537
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,120
- No, no, no, you were right.
I don't need a Snoog.

538
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,550
It's way too fancy.

539
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,990
It is stupid.
- It's not stupid.

540
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,480
I said you didn't need it

541
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,740
because I already bought you
a stroller

542
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,260
for your shower
this weekend,

543
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,820
and it's just—isn't as fancy,
and I felt bad.

544
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,830
- Rosa, I would love
any stroller you got me

545
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,610
because it came from you.
- It's a Luftroller.

546
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,830
- Oh, that is—
that is a great stroller.

547
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,840
- I got you a gift receipt.
- Thank you so much.

548
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,620
- I cleaned up
as much as I could,

549
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,010
but I think that couch

550
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,630
is gonna smell like bone broth
for a while.

551
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,150
So did you talk to your friend?

552
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,060
Any chance
he'll reconsider investing?

553
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,810
- Yeah, that's not happening.

554
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,110
He said that was
the most scared he's ever been,

555
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,930
and he was on that plane
that landed on the Hudson.

556
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,160
- I guess that's it.

557
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,640
I'm never gonna make
my $11,000 back.

558
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,070
- Actually, I called
another guy from my gym.

559
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,640
He wants to buy the domain

560
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,250
workplacebonebuds.com
off of you.

561
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,740
- That's amazing!

562
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,160
I can't believe you found
someone else

563
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,600
who runs a bone broth company
with a coworker.

564
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,170
What are the odds?

565
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,170
- No, obviously he wants
to make a website

566
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,310
that helps people hook up
with their coworkers.

567
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,270
- I don't see it.
- Charles.

568
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,660
It's called
workplacebonebuds.com.

569
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,180
- All I hear
is friendship and broth.

570
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,870
But yeah, I mean he wants
to burn his money,

571
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,530
I'll light the match.
Yeah, tell him to call me.

572
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,320
His loss.

573
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,970
- So what's your plan here,
Kingston?

574
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,620
You gonna torture me?

575
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,150
You gonna put my beard back on
and rip it off again?

576
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,800
- No, I'm gonna cut off
each one of your fingers

577
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,200
until you tell me
who the rat is.

578
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,890
- I see.
Well that's bad news,

579
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,770
because I don't know
who the rat is,

580
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,680
and I need all my fingers
if I'm gonna beat Wario.

581
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,900
- You can't beat Wario?
- You can?

582
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,330
How do you do it?
- It's simple.

583
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,730
When he's approaching,
you just tap the—

584
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,210
Damn it!

585
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,820
Motion detector!
- I'm sorry, what do you tap?

586
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,820
- Get up, let's go!
- Kingston!

587
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,170
What do you tap?
What do you tap?

588
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,040
- NYPD!
NYPD!

589
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,260
- Split up!
Cover the exits!

590
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,140
Freeze!
- Captain!

591
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,710
Captain!
- He's not getting away!

592
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,740
He took my dog!
- Oh, my God.

593
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,750
It's happening!

594
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,320
Aah!

595
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,370
Oh, I see you have a knife.

596
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,940
But what you need
is an umbrella.

597
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,770
- Tell him why.
Tell him why!

598
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,860
- 'Cause there's a storm
gonna rain down on you, punk.

599
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,260
- Ooh.

600
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,840
My goodness.

601
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,630
- Awh!
- Ooo-hoo-hoo!

602
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,600
- You took
the wrong fluffy boy!

603
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,300
He's done.
Cuff him.

604
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,430
- Yes, sir.

605
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,870
That was the single coolest
thing that has ever happened.

606
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,310
- Relax, Peralta.

607
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,310
That wasn't even the coolest
thing I've ever done.

608
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,790
- What have you done
that's cooler?

609
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,140
- It was the '80s.
It was nothing, I mean,

610
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,660
they made a movie out of it,
but whatever.

611
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,840
- What?
What movie?

612
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,320
- I don't remember the title.

613
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,620
Uh, there was a crime
on a plane, I was a passenger.

614
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,020
- Was it "Passenger 57?"
- I honestly don't know.

615
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,760
- It had to have been.
Just say it was that.

616
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,410
- You know, Peralta,
sometimes I don't understand

617
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,370
the words
coming out of your mouth.

618
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,980
- Oh, my God,
was it "Rush Hour?"

619
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,410
- What?
No.

620
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,810
You know what?
I'm too old for this crap.

621
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,770
- It was "Lethal Weapon?"
Sir, are you Murtaugh?

622
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,910
Does that make me Riggs?

623
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,780
I'm Riggs!

624
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,780
- Fremulon.

625
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,870
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
