1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,640
- Jake, will you join me
in Terry's office?

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,700
- Oh, private rendezvous, huh?

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,900
This whole trying
to make a baby thing

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,300
has got you super freak—
hey, Terry!

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,740
What's up, dude?
- What did you think

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,300
was happening?
- He clearly thought

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,830
you were gonna
have secret sex in here.

8
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,960
- What?
Inappropes, much?

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,230
I did not think that.
Amy did.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,580
She texted me about it.
See? Proof.

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,490
Anyway, what's up, Lieutenant?
- Santiago and I

12
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,570
are going to
an administration workshop

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,490
for the NYPD.
- And it's voluntary,

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,460
so only the cool kids
are gonna be there.

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,670
- I love you so much.
Continue.

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,490
- Anyways, you're in charge
for the day.

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,970
- Oh, boy.
Here comes the lecture.

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,280
"Be responsible, Jake. Don't
do anything crazy or fun."

19
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,250
- There's no lecture.
I trust you.

20
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,810
- Well, but there always
used to be a lecture.

21
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,370
- Yeah, well,
you're not the same

22
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,690
immature, rebellious kid
you used to be.

23
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,250
Didn't you and Amy buy

24
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,850
a family-friendly
midsize sedan?

25
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,340
- In a rebellious color—
champagne—which is an alcohol.

26
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,910
And let's not forget,
I wanted to have sex

27
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,300
in your office just now.

28
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,560
- Yeah, to have a baby
and become a father!

29
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:55,740
- Yeah, he turned it around
on me.

30
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,910
- It's not bad
that I trust you more now.

31
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,400
Plus, there's not even
that much

32
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,700
for you guys to do today.

33
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,870
I mean, the squad is on
reserve parade duty.

34
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,530
Your job is to sit around.
- Good point.

35
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,740
Besides, what's the worst thing

36
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,700
a responsible guy like me
could do?

37
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,450
Buckle your butts, everyone!

38
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,270
The Jimmy Jab Games
are back!

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,690
Squad, today we write
a new chapter

40
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,990
in the history
of the Nine-Nine.

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,650
And that chapter begins with
the word "Jimmy,"

42
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,900
and ends with the word "Jab."

43
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,300
- That chapter's only
two words long.

44
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,660
- No, there's a lot of words
in between.

45
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,920
It's a long chapter.
The point is,

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,490
today we compete against
one another

47
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,570
in a series of games,

48
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,610
and this year's winner

49
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,530
receives one day's
paid vacation,

50
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,000
courtesy of Officer Mark.

51
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,880
- You said you needed that day
for a private matter.

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,270
- You know what?
You shouldn't even be here.

53
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,710
Everyone say,
"Thank you, Officer Mark.

54
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,360
Bye, Officer Mark."
all: Thank you, Officer Mark.

55
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,670
Bye, Officer Mark.

56
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,930
- Now, who's ready to compete?
- Count me in.

57
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,940
I could really use this day off

58
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,680
to spend some time
with my husband.

59
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,200
- Oh, please.
We all have loved ones.

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,580
You're not getting any sympathy
just because you're gay.

61
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,800
- Rosa, I don't think he was—

62
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,720
- No, I was.
She saw right through me.

63
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,690
Nevertheless,
I will destroy you all.

64
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,950
- Copy that.
I love your intensity.

65
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,780
Now, Gina is gone,
so we're out of a host.

66
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,950
- Me! Please, me.

67
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,340
It's my time to shine.

68
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,610
It's my "Greatest Showman"
moment.

69
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,870
- Charles, you can't.

70
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,440
- You know who else
they told "You can't"?

71
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,050
Lettie Lutz, the bearded lady.

72
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,960
But then,
Mr. Barnum gave her a stage.

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,350
Give me my stage, Jacob.

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,750
- Wait, so you're
the bearded lady?

75
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,400
- No! I'm Barnum,
you're Zac Efron,

76
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,790
and everyone else
is one of my freaks.

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
- Look, I would love
to give you the hosting duties

78
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,440
so you can work through
whatever weird fantasy this is,

79
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,790
but we need
at least six players

80
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,970
and the host can't play.

81
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,540
- Then I'll find someone
to replace me.

82
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,100
I promise you will have
your circus, Mr. Barnum.

83
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,630
- I thought you were Barnum.
- No!

84
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,540
I'm the greatest showman!

85
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,370
- Isn't that Barnum?

86
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,730
- Debbie, ah,
just who I was looking for.

87
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,950
- Oh, no. Am I in your seat?
I'll sit on the floor.

88
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,040
- Wh-what? No.
No, don't do that.

89
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,520
No, I was just wondering

90
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
if you would like
to take my place

91
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,680
in a little
squad competition today.

92
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,860
- Mm. I can't do competitions.
I'm anti-dexterous.

93
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,480
- Hmm?
- It's when neither hand

94
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,820
is good at anything.
- Oh, Debbie.

95
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,390
I was once like you.

96
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,050
A bashful beat cop
with long, curly hair

97
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,570
and no confidence at all.

98
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,490
- That's impossible.
You're so suave.

99
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,700
- Sure, now I am.

100
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,660
But I came a long way,

101
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,850
and I did it
by challenging myself

102
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,980
to do things
I never thought I could.

103
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,160
This is your chance
to find that confidence.

104
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,760
- I don't know.
- Debbie...

105
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,510
trust me.

106
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,860
- Okay.

107
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,030
But only because
I trust everyone.

108
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,720
- So, Diaz,
I've never been more excited.

109
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,590
My first time
playing the Jimmy Jabs,

110
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,810
and I'm destined to win.

111
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,860
Look at my competition.

112
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,090
Little Miss Hay For Brains.

113
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,160
The Hay Brains,

114
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,170
and King Brain Made of Hay.

115
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,560
- Well, you're forgetting
about me.

116
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,960
I'm also your competition.
- Yes,

117
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,610
but you don't normally
care about games like these.

118
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,650
- Well, I do care
about this game.

119
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,530
And you're gonna lose because
my brains aren't made of hay.

120
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,400
My brains are made of brains.

121
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,050
- Oh, ho.

122
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,150
The perfect retort.

123
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,060
- Gather up,
it's Jimmy Jam time!

124
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,970
- Ooh, are you doing
opening ceremonies?

125
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,500
- Yeah, and you might
wanna leave

126
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,850
before things get too crazy.

127
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,630
A little plausible deniability.

128
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,450
- Actually, I wanna record 'em.

129
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,890
May you can
teach other precincts

130
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,550
how to throw their own versions
to boost morale.

131
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,110
- No, I'm not a teacher.

132
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,990
I'm a class clown/bad boy
with a heart of gold. Whatever.

133
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,600
Charles, just start.

134
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,170
- Ladies and gentlemen.

135
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,560
The moment
you've been waiting for.

136
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,080
- Wow, he went full "Showman."

137
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,700
I present to you six freaks,

138
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,790
who, through a series
of elaborate games,

139
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,050
Will be eliminated one by one

140
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,490
until a champion is crowned.

141
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,100
And that champion shall...

142
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,880
inherit my circus.

143
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,570
- And get a day off.
- I was getting there, Ro-Ro.

144
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,840
Let me have my fun.
- Yeah, Ro-Ro,

145
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,830
let him have his fun.

146
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,230
- As always, we start the games

147
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,940
by lighting the ceremonial
bagel of destiny.

148
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,110
- Ah, it's actually
the baguette of destiny

149
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,240
because this year, we're
throwing caution to the wind.

150
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,470
Charles, flame me.

151
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,690
- ♪ Jimmy Jabs
Jimmy Jabs ♪

152
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,600
♪ Jimmy Jabs

153
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,160
- And with that,
we commence...

154
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,960
my ten minute
opening performance.

155
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,520
- What?
- ♪ The crowd is ready

156
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,210
♪ The freaks are here

157
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,660
- Wow, this is
a really long performance.

158
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,140
Charles pulled off
a costume change.

159
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,620
- I wouldn't say
he pulled it off.

160
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,530
He accidentally got bottomless
in front of all of us.

161
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,000
- Yeah.
- Peralta,

162
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,130
how about we make these games
a little more exciting

163
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,920
with a wager?
- Ooh, interesting.

164
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,760
What'd you have in mind?
- If you win,

165
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,020
I'll do your paperwork
for a year.

166
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,060
- Go on.
- If I win, I get your new car.

167
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,230
You're joking, right?

168
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
- Why?
Because you can't imagine

169
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,110
someone bitchin' like me
driving a lame family sedan?

170
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,500
- No, because Jake
would never bet our car.

171
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,990
- Yeah, I would never do that.

172
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,510
But also, it's not lame.

173
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,990
It's the color of an alcohol.
Everyone's talking about it.

174
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,770
- No, Jake,
it's a super lame car.

175
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,030
But I don't mind.

176
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,460
My ex-step-son
kicked me out of the house,

177
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,070
and I need a place to crash
with air conditioning.

178
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,640
- Look, the bet
is not happening.

179
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,610
- Sorry, Amy, but this is
between Jake and me.

180
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,300
Dude, what happened
to the cool guy

181
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,730
that liked to make bets
with his best bud?

182
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,250
- Okay, Hitchcock, drop it.

183
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Jake doesn't do
that kind of thing anymore.

184
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,180
He's an adult now.
- Hitchcock, you're on!

185
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,260
- He is?
- I am?

186
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,750
- I don't know. Yes!
Yes, you are.

187
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,100
- Damn it, my pants.

188
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,190
Sorry, everyone.
Look away, look away.

189
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,580
- Oh, damn.

190
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,010
- Wow, who knew?

191
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,200
He really is
the greatest showman.

192
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,100
- What the hell are you doing?

193
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,100
Why did you just bet
our new car?

194
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,100
- Because it's fun.

195
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,370
And because it's who I am.

196
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,860
I mean, remember
all those crazy bets

197
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,340
we used to make when you were
falling in love with me?

198
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,200
- I remember the bets we made
when I found you obnoxious

199
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,730
and difficult to be around.

200
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,170
- Yes, those bets.
See, you remember.

201
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,860
This is just like that.
- Hey, Santiago,

202
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,850
it's time to head out.

203
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,860
- Actually, I'm not leaving.

204
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,040
I'm gonna stay for the games.

205
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,040
- Ohh, look who's coming
around already.

206
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,030
We're gonna have fun.
- No, this isn't fun.

207
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,210
A voluntary
administration workshop is fun.

208
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,270
- Yeah, I hear it ends

209
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,740
with a six page
self-assessment.

210
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,820
- Oh, come on, Terry!

211
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,040
You don't have to rub it in!

212
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,040
- Welcome to
the first competition.

213
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,480
Which one of you
will meet your maker?

214
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,220
Be sure not to foul out,

215
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,440
or you will meet your end.

216
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,440
- We don't know
what the game is,

217
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,530
so these puns don't work.

218
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,140
- It's a meat throwing
challenge.

219
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,490
All of the expired cold cuts
from the kitchen refrigerator

220
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,930
are under this tarp.

221
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,120
Voila!

222
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,730
You will toss
a meat of your choosing

223
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,380
at the break room window
from ten feet away.

224
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,810
If it sticks to the glass,
well, then you move on.

225
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,870
If it doesn't, then you're a—
- Cold cut?

226
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,560
- Yes, now you're getting it.
Thank you, Rosa.

227
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,130
- Yah!
- Jake sticks it.

228
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,910
Amy sticks it.

229
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,350
Scully sticks it.

230
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,820
Hitchcock sticks it.

231
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,910
Holt old school sticks it.

232
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,000
Ro-Ro sticks it.

233
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,100
Debbie—where's Debbie?

234
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,280
- I can't do this, Charles.
I didn't even grab a meat.

235
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,500
I'm not some expert
cold cut thrower like you.

236
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,500
- Everyone, I need a second
for a freak in trouble.

237
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,810
Debbie, I once stood here
in front of this squad

238
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,290
and felt like I didn't belong.
- But—

239
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,590
- But nothing.
This is your chance

240
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,580
to do something great.

241
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,980
Debbie, this is your moment.

242
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,120
Take it, and stick this meat.

243
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,900
- Is this turkey?
- Yes.

244
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm very allergic to turkey.

245
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,290
- Hold her down!
- Ahh!

246
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,900
So Debbie's out.

247
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,340
But she'll be fine,
thanks to her purse

248
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,830
full of EpiPens.

249
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,610
And now, that brings us
to the end of round one,

250
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,300
which mean it is time
for another song.

251
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,130
♪ It was the meet
of the moment ♪

252
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,830
♪ Meat, meat, meat
of the moment ♪

253
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,060
- Yeah, we'll be back in five.
- ♪ Throw, throw, throw it

254
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,580
♪ At the window,
window, window ♪

255
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,790
- So I bet you're wondering
how I did so well

256
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,010
in that last competition.
- Actually, I was impressed

257
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,330
you didn't eat any of the meat.

258
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,550
- Well, I don't deserve
all the credit.

259
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,060
Scully, show 'em
what we're working with.

260
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,990
- This is Dorothy,
my pill box.

261
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,510
- Good God.
- My friend here

262
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,250
has dozens
of medications prescribed

263
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,380
for all of his ailments.

264
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,560
They make him normal.

265
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
They make me limitless.

266
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,030
- This blood thinner
can suppress appetite.

267
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,870
This eczema pill can cause
extreme muscle spasms.

268
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,170
- Which is pretty inconvenient,

269
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,990
unless you need to hurl meat
across the room.

270
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,430
- My God. He's doping.

271
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,010
- Welcome to the big leagues.

272
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,400
- Well, looks like things

273
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,010
just got
a little more interesting.

274
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,490
- No, they got worse.

275
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,450
- Amy, it's like Torrance
from "Bring It On" says,

276
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,670
"You'll never be the best
until you win against the best.

277
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,150
- Didn't they lose in the end?

278
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,190
- Yeah, but this is different.

279
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,310
Hitchcock isn't nearly as good

280
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,580
as the East Compton Clovers.

281
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,060
It's like,
where's your head at?

282
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,020
It's gonna be fine.
It might not be fine.

283
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,020
- Diaz, congratulations
on moving on

284
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,200
to the second round,
said I, sarcastically.

285
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,460
- Oh, you're still in this.

286
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,690
I knew a uniformed officer
had been eliminated,

287
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,300
I just couldn't remember
which one.

288
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,120
- Okay, we're both great
at insults. Let's move on.

289
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,940
Tell me, why do you wanna
win this game so badly?

290
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,900
- Honestly...
I guess I still feel like

291
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,640
my parents don't accept
my sexuality.

292
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,430
And winning this
will let me prove to myself

293
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,440
that as long as I feel good
about who I am,

294
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
that's all that matters.

295
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,220
- That's a load of dung.

296
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,230
You processed that parent stuff
a year ago.

297
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,490
- You're right, we're going
to drag brunch this Sunday.

298
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:55,140
- No. There's something private
that is fueling you.

299
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,980
And when I find
that private fuel,

300
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,290
I will extract it
to use as my private fuel

301
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,490
in my private fuel tank.

302
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,190
Then I will have a full tank
of private fuel,

303
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,110
and you will have an empty tank
of private—

304
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Rosa.

305
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,030
- Welcome to K-9 Hide-and-Seek.

306
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,590
You'll be given
five minutes to hide,

307
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,420
during which time
Officer Frisbee

308
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,950
will be learning your scent.

309
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,420
Whoever he finds first is out.

310
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,160
- How'd you get our clothes?
- Doesn't matter.

311
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,430
Now, hide, freaks!

312
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,180
Hide from the society
that shunned you!

313
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,100
- What? Why aren't you hiding?
Are you quitting?

314
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,100
- Oh, no, quite the opposite.

315
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,270
This little guy keeps
Scully's liver from imploding,

316
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,610
but it has a neat side effect.

317
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,700
It also masks your natural odor

318
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,530
and makes you smell
like a dead fish.

319
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,450
- Ew.
- Who's got two stinky thumbs

320
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,400
that stink like rotten salmon?

321
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,100
This stinky guy.

322
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,330
- You suck.

323
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,770
- Ready or not,
here comes my hellhound!

324
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,130
- I'm a mop.

325
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,250
Shh.

326
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,690
- The flattop
has left the big top.

327
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,050
Uh, wait, where's Jake?

328
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,180
- Well, there's a TV cart

329
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,490
suspiciously in the middle
of the room,

330
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,970
that ceiling tile's
out of place,

331
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,140
and he said he was going
to hide somewhere reckless,

332
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,130
so I'm guessing he's up there.

333
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,570
- That's right, Amy.
I'm in the ceiling.

334
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,490
Unlike you boring, old fogies,

335
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,020
I found the craziest—

336
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,500
Don't worry.

337
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,800
My bones and ribs
broke my fall.

338
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,640
- Time for
our next competition,

339
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,250
The Hellevator.

340
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,600
You see, normally, our elevator
can hold up to 12 freaks.

341
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,290
But what if it's filled
with boxes,

342
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,260
and those freaks
are wearing bomb suits?

343
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,480
Well then,
its capacity drops to four.

344
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,920
Oh, but Mr. Barnum,
there are five freaks here.

345
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,790
Whatever shall we do?

346
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,920
That's the twist.

347
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,880
You have to
fight for your spot.

348
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,970
And once those
elevator doors close,

349
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,790
one of you will be out.

350
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,700
Oh, did I mention, you have to
do it all in bomb suits?

351
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,500
- Yes, that was one of
the first things you mentioned.

352
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,880
- Oh, sorry.
I was thinking of my next song.

353
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,500
Anyway, suit up, freaks!

354
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,770
- You're pretty hurt, huh?
- Yeah.

355
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,970
It's very exciting.

356
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,630
I'm the underdog now,
like Seabiscuit.

357
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,860
I mean, sure,
I can't lift my arms,

358
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,380
but Seabiscuit won
without even having arms.

359
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,300
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know. I fell.

360
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,470
We're already married.
It doesn't matter.

361
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,730
- Well, you guys are in
for a beating.

362
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,590
- What, is that some kind
of kidney pill?

363
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,340
- It's to reduce
my various swellings.

364
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,550
- Basically, it's just speed.

365
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,080
- That's illegal, and—
- Ack-ack-ack-ack!

366
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,960
- Okay, here we go, everyone.

367
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,480
The game begins
when the elevator doors ding.

368
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,950
Are you ready
for the Hellevator?

369
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,480
- Buckle up.
The juice is loose!

370
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,400
Here we go, Hitchcock!

371
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,620
- What the?

372
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,890
- Jake, let me in, let me in!

373
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,590
- Amy, I'm not gonna make it!

374
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,420
You just go for the day off.
You've earned it.

375
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,680
- No, we're gonna lose the car!

376
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,940
- Oh, crap! Right, the car.

377
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,380
Oh, no,
we're gonna lose the car!

378
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,860
- Hell no, we won't!

379
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,510
She "Armageddon'd" me.

380
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,550
- I don't know
what that means.

381
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,730
- Another love's sacrifice,

382
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,550
and another lover reborn.

383
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,380
These games truly
have it all.

384
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,130
And now, a quick intermission

385
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,000
for one of my legendary
costume changes.

386
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,350
All right, come on, Charles.

387
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,830
Quick change,
no time for touch-ups.

388
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,960
We're running long.

389
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,930
- Ow!
- Oh, Debbie.

390
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,970
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm just recovering

391
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,140
from the EpiPen.

392
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,800
I'm sorry
I messed everything up.

393
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,800
I'm just not cut out
for this high-stakes world

394
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,620
of having fun with friends.
- First off,

395
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,760
if you think you messed
this up, you're crazy.

396
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,020
Nothing can mess up
the performance

397
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm putting on out there.

398
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,580
Secondly, what you did today
was incredible.

399
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,020
- I got disqualified
immediately.

400
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,980
- Did I ever tell you the story
of my Jimmy Jabs humiliation?

401
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,810
- No. You pretty much
never talked to me till today.

402
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,480
- Well, it was 2009,
it was the opening ceremonies

403
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,910
and I couldn't be more excited.

404
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,860
I even got my hair styled
just for the event.

405
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,130
- Charles, flame me.

406
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,910
I was out before the games
even began.

407
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,790
But I wouldn't change
that moment for the world

408
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,570
because it made me realize
that not even flames

409
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,580
can grind me down to dust.

410
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,920
There is a place for us,
for we are glorious.

411
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,710
- You are the bearded lady.
- We are all the bearded lady.

412
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,030
Now ask yourself what have you
always wanted to do,

413
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,810
but were too scared to try?
- Sing.

414
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,070
- What?
- I wanna sing

415
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,540
in front of everyone.
- Okay, little lady,

416
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,940
you get that voice warmed up

417
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,210
because you are doing
the closing ceremonies.

418
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,820
- I can't. I haven't prepared.

419
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,210
I don't even know the song.

420
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,990
- Welcome to show business.
It waits for no one.

421
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,780
You're on in an hour.

422
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,170
- So Diaz, I figured out
why you wanna win.

423
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,790
I hacked your work calendar.

424
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,870
- Those calendars are public.

425
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,040
Everyone on the system
has access.

426
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,180
- I hacked it.
I'm a hacker.

427
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,780
Anyhow, you took a vacation
14 days ago,

428
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,700
and yet, you already
want another day off?

429
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,100
Odd, unless you need it
for a unique,

430
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,960
once-in-a-lifetime occurrence.

431
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,880
Perhaps a proposal
to your girlfriend Jocelyn.

432
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,100
- What?
- You've been dating

433
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,460
for a year, you've met
each other's parents,

434
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,900
and you just got
your nails done

435
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,770
to present her with a ring.

436
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,820
- Jocelyn broke up with me.
- What?

437
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,210
- I want the day off
so I can sit around

438
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,120
and listen to death metal
and get my head right.

439
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,200
- But what about
my nail polish solve?

440
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,860
- Getting my nails done
made me feel better

441
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,650
for a second.
- Ahh!

442
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,210
This is a trick
to throw me off.

443
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,570
I bet things
are better than ever and you—

444
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh.

445
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,130
You really are crying.

446
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,660
- Welcome to my most
sadistic creation.

447
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,660
The tangled nightmare
of extension cords

448
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,190
that lives
in our supply closet.

449
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,670
Your mission is to untangle
your lamp's cord, plug it in,

450
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,800
and then pull yourself to it
on your dolly and turn it on.

451
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,150
- Oh, nice. Hitchcock's
coming down from the speed.

452
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,500
I have a chance.

453
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,670
- Freaks, begin!

454
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,510
- Jake!

455
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,850
- What is that?
- Grab the top one

456
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,550
and yank the bottom one!
- Oh, thank God

457
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,820
that's what she meant.

458
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,080
Although, I'm open
to whatever you wanna try.

459
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,640
- Diaz, I wanna apologize.

460
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,870
- I'm not talking to you.

461
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,830
Oh, oh, Amy, it worked!

462
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,700
The banging worked!
- What? No!

463
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,570
- Here we go.

464
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,870
- Go.

465
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,320
- Gotcha.

466
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
- You're never gonna catch me.

467
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,800
Yes, I did it!

468
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,190
And Hitchcock's gonna lose!

469
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,840
Rosa and Holt
are gonna beat him.

470
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,540
- Rosa, stop. I give up.

471
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,620
I want you to know
I'm sorry for prying.

472
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,230
Win this thing,
and enjoy your day off.

473
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
And if you ever want
a friend to sit with you

474
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,160
and silently listen
to death metal,

475
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,560
just know I'm always here.

476
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
- Okay. I'd like that.

477
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,330
- Ah, no!
What are you freaks doing?

478
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,550
- We're leaving
the competition.

479
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,030
Some things are more important
than a game.

480
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,120
- No, they're not!
Wait, where are you going?

481
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,340
Don't leave!
We need you to—

482
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,230
Why does the ceiling hate me?

483
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,750
- I don't get it.
Why did you make this bet

484
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,220
in the first place?
- I don't know.

485
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,310
Terry kept saying
all that stuff

486
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,620
about how I matured,

487
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,240
and I got worried
I was becoming a boring adult.

488
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,890
- You are not a boring adult.

489
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,550
- No. I am.

490
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,680
You wanna know why
I really wanted

491
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,240
that year of no paperwork?

492
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,450
It's so if we did get pregnant,

493
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I would have more time
to help with the baby.

494
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,290
- Aww.
- No, save your "aww."

495
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,630
I don't deserve it. I'm just
some boring, responsible guy

496
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,160
that's about to lose our car.

497
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,560
- You're still
pretty irresponsible.

498
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,820
- Aww.

499
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,560
You're just saying that
'cause you're my wife.

500
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,080
- No, I'm not.

501
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,560
Yesterday,
you took the batteries

502
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,990
out of our smoke detector

503
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,090
to put in your
Big Mouth Billy Bass.

504
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,090
- You noticed.
- Yeah.

505
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,910
In a bad way.
- Yeah.

506
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
- Now get up,
and win this bet.

507
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,580
You can do this.
- Yeah, you're right.

508
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,140
I can do this.
- Yeah.

509
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,400
Yeah, I maybe can't do this.

510
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,450
- The time has come
for the grand finale,

511
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,580
the obstacle course.

512
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,280
- This is gonna be rough.

513
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,280
Turns out,
taking a ton of random pills

514
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,590
is really bad for you.

515
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,200
Everything hurts.

516
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,320
- Yeah, I'm like
50/50 gonna die.

517
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,280
- On your mark, get set,
dazzle me, freaks!

518
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,300
First, you must make your way
past the barricade hurdles.

519
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,080
- After the hurdles,

520
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,380
you must fish a dollar coin
out of our gross,

521
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,220
clogged-up
sink of nightmares.

522
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,260
- Ahh!
- Ew.

523
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,300
- You use that money
to buy a hot dog.

524
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,570
After you eat the entire dog,

525
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,130
you'll return
to the break room,

526
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,580
where you must extract
an olive

527
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,360
from the windpipe
of a Heimlich practice dummy.

528
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,360
- Why are you using your mouth
for everything?

529
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,090
- The winner
will be the first person

530
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,620
to sit in
the Ringmaster's throne.

531
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,670
Uh-oh, surprise twist!

532
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,010
To get to the throne,
you must break through

533
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,750
a breach training door.
- What?

534
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,410
Why are you making this
so hard on me?

535
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,550
- It's all for the show, Jake.

536
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,200
The greatest show on Earth!

537
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,630
- All right, fine.
I can do this.

538
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,340
For my wife.

539
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,600
Ah, it didn't work.

540
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,440
My skeleton feels like
it's made of Skittles.

541
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,140
I can't do it, Amy.
- Yes, you can, okay?

542
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,660
You just need a little energy.

543
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,360
And Debbie's EpiPens
are full of adrenaline.

544
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,050
- Is that a smart thing to do?
- Probably not,

545
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,260
but sometimes it's good
to be a little irresponsible.

546
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,310
- You're gonna make me sick.

547
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,410
- It's better
than losing our car.

548
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,580
- I mean, is it? 'Cause—

549
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,270
I will never die!

550
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,280
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

551
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,420
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Hoo!
- Jake is champion!

552
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,590
Congratulations,
you inherit the circus!

553
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,540
- I did it!
I don't want the circus.

554
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,300
- You like it?
- Not at all.

555
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,690
- You can leave.
- Not a chance.

556
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,340
- The show is over,
lessons were learned,

557
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,390
tears were cried.

558
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,820
Just remember, freaks,

559
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,620
the real freak
is the freak inside.

560
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,390
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Debbie Fogel.

566
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,730
- Well, that was weird.

567
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,220
- Whoa-ho-ho,
you hear that?

568
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,440
It's the total silence
of people reeling

569
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,090
from the performance
of a lifetime.

570
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,610
How does it feel?
- Incredible.

571
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,440
I've never been that loud.
- That's what most singing is.

572
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,260
And with more practice,
you'll only get louder.

573
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,870
Do you really think
they liked it?

574
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,270
It doesn't matter
what other people think.

575
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,580
What matters
is that you can do anything

576
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,230
you put your mind to,
because in the end,

577
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,890
my bearded lady,
the beard was under you,

578
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,710
the greatest showman.

579
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,450
You're right.
I can do anything.

580
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,770
Anything I put my mind to.

581
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,780
♪ Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yes, oh ♪

582

- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
