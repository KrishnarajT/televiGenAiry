It's just... too dangerous.

517
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:37,120
[sighs]

518
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:38,889
Good-bye, Nine-Nine.

519
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:41,892
And with that, I left.

520
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:46,297
♪

521
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:49,966
- Oh, sweet, sweet coffee.

522
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,001
Come to mama.

523
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:53,036
- Shut your loud mouth, Amy.

524
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:54,838
Some of us have a hangover.

525
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,541
- [laughs]
Man, last night was dope.

526
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:59,910
Wait, did Gina really
go to Puerto Rico

527
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:01,478
with that drug store cashier?

528
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:04,114
- Yeah.
They seemed really happy.

529
00:19:04,147 --> 00:19:06,149
- They really did.
- Yeah.

530
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:07,951
- Huh.

531
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,320
Hey, man.
How'd it go last night?

532
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,754
Sarge cool with Adrian now?

533
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:13,324
- Oh, so you haven't
seen him, huh?

534
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:14,725
- No.

535
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:16,159
I figured he just passed out
at your place or something.

536
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:17,328
Why?
What's going on?

537
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,630
- [sighs]
Oh, man.

538
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:21,332
Let's go for a walk.

539
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:27,103
He wanted me to tell you
that he loves you.

540
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:29,239
- Is that it?
Did he say anything else?

541
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,140
- Um...

542
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,776
- May the lord be with you.

543
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:35,579
- Adrian.
- Oh, thank God.

544
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,585
- You scared me.
I thought you left.

545
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:43,186
- I did.

546
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:46,423
I was burning my fingerprints
off in a gas station bathroom

547
00:19:46,457 --> 00:19:48,158
when I thought about
what Jake said.

548
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:51,094
I couldn't leave without
seeing you one last time.

549
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:52,596
[sighs]

550
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:55,499
I want to lick your whole body
clean like a kitty cat.

551
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:58,602
- And I'm gonna give you two
a little space.

552
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:00,303
- I have to go.

553
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:01,672
But I'll be back for you.

554
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:03,306
- I'll wait.

555
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,276
And while I'm waiting,
I will find that FBI agent

556
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,012
and I will rip his head off
with my bare hands.

557
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:11,715
- That is the sweetest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

558
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:12,716
I love you.

559
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:14,451
- I love you.

560
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:29,466
- You okay?

561
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,202
- Yeah, I will be.

562
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:34,037
- I watched you guys kiss.
I didn't know where to look.

563
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,140
- All right, let's go inside.
- Okay.

564
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:39,743
- Sergeant Jeffords briefed me
about the Pimento situation.

565
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,678
Sounds like I missed
a hell of a week.

566
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:43,480
We need to bring Figgis
to justice

567
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,649
and find whoever is
helping him in the FBI.

568
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:48,318
As of right now, we have
very little to go on.

569
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:49,486
- Yeah, the guy was wearing
a ski mask,

570
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,389
but he had a large scar
on his right palm.

571
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:55,258
[dark music]

572
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:57,227
I have a similar scar
on my back.

573
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,929
Banged into Amy's
kitchen cabinet.

574
00:20:58,995 --> 00:21:00,196
No big deal.
Continue.

575
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,432
- This mission is top secret.

576
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,434
No one can know
what we're doing.

577
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:06,302
- Detective Pimento's a good man
and he's one of us.

578
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:10,006
So let's catch these
bastards for him and Rosa.

579
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:12,476
- Nine-Nine!
- Discretely, Jacob.

580
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,677
- [whispers]
Nine-Nine.

581
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:14,778
[all whispering]
Nine-Nine!

582
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,181
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
