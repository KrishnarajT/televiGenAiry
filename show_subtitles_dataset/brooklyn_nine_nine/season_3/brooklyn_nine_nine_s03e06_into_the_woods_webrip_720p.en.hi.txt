up to the cabin.

- What's up?
How can i help?

170
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:34,228
- Well, when i was a kid,

171
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:36,363
I invented a magnetic
flashlight clip

172
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:40,101
So i could read
under the covers.

173
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,370
This clip and i went
all around the world together—

terabithia.

00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:49,611
- But never
to a friend's house, huh?

176
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:51,378
- Uncalled for.

177
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,681
Anyway, i realized that this
could be really helpful

178
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,683
For police work,
so i made an appointment

179
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:57,384
With the head
of nypd purchasing.

180
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,353
I have to sell him on it,
but i'm afraid

181
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:02,590
I might come across
a little boring.

182
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:05,192
- [gasps]
amy, are you asking me

183
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,427
To "she's all that" you?

184
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:07,995
- I didn't read that.

185
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:10,698
But if it's about
helping out a friend, then yes.

186
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:13,635
Please "she's all that" me.

187
00:06:13,668 --> 00:06:14,636
- Okay.

188
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,938
But if we're gonna do this,

189
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,173
We're gonna do it my way,
all right?

190
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,943
First i'm going to need
to break you down to nothing

191
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:24,111
And then build you back up
piece by piece.

192
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:25,379
- Well, the meeting's
tomorrow.

193
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:27,014
- Well, we'll just
break you down to nothing

194
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,449
And see what time it is.

195
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,819
- Mmm!
What is that smell?

196
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:34,556
- That is the absence of urine.

197
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,057
You got to leave brooklyn
to get that.

198
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:38,025
- No urine—
i could get used to this.

199
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:39,226
- Oh, yes.

200
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:40,795
And that's just the beginning,
my friend.

201
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:42,564
Just wait till
you're sitting fireside,

202
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,566
Sipping on a premium
chinese scotch,

203
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:46,734
And smoking a sweet
rwandan cigar.

204
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,235
- Okay.
Okay.

205
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:50,738
I probably could have done
without the countries of origin,

206
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,039
But that sounds great.

207
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:53,407
- Yeah.
- What else do you have planned?

208
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,843
- Oh, so much.
I'm talking fishing.

209
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,679
I'm talking poker.
I'm talking frisbee.

210
00:06:57,712 --> 00:06:59,080
Boyle, what else
am i talking?

211
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:01,649
- Wildflower picking so we can
make our own cologne.

212
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:03,484
- Nope, i was talking
bonfires and s'mores,

213
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:05,119
But that's my fault
for throwing to you.

214
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:06,588
- This is going to be
fun as hell.

215
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,990
- This is going to be
the best weekend ever!

216
00:07:09,056 --> 00:07:11,626
- Welcome to stink puddle manor.

217
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,060
- Stink puddle?

218
00:07:13,094 --> 00:07:14,829
- Manor.

219
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:18,666
Name your house
stink puddle?

220
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:19,667
- Oh, i didn't.

221
00:07:19,734 --> 00:07:20,968
The home inspector
came up with it.

222
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:23,304
I can't smell anything
since the radiation therapy.

223
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:25,439
- Another great story, eh?

224
00:07:25,472 --> 00:07:28,610
- So there's no power,
no heat.

225
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,611
- Is there running water?

226
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:31,245
- Of course there's
running water.

227
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:32,346
Oh, but i wouldn't use it.

228
00:07:32,413 --> 00:07:33,748
It's very contaminated.

229
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:34,916
We had three dogs
die in the well.

230
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:36,083
- Three?

231
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:37,418
- If they weren't
all tied together,

232
00:07:37,451 --> 00:07:38,986
We might have just
lost the one.

233
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,022
Sad thing is, they were
therapy dogs for my son.

234
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:42,356
- Oh.

235
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:44,325
- He had real abandonment issues
after my wife left.

236
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:45,960
It was kind of like
an emotional scar

237
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:47,194
On an emotional scar.

238
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:48,996
- But the woods are
super nice, right?

239
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,431
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Gorgeous.

240
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,099
Except during sinkhole season.

241
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,300
- When's sinkhole season?

242
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,869
- It's been going on for,
like, 20 years now.

243
00:07:54,936 --> 00:07:56,704
It's kind of like
a "game of thrones" winter.

244
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:57,705
- Right. Yeah.

245
00:07:57,772 --> 00:07:59,173
- Anyway, i'll leave
you guys to it.

246
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:00,407
Have fun.

247
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:02,443
Don't do anything
i wouldn't do.

248
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:03,444
For instance,

249
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,546
Drink the water
or let your wife

250
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:06,648
Go on work trips.

251
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,115
- Duly noted.

252
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:09,651
- You wanted to see me?

253
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:11,218
- I told kevin about
how i approved

254
00:08:11,252 --> 00:08:12,787
Of your strategy
for breaking up with marcus,

255
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:15,923
And he said that we were
"sociopaths."

256
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:16,924
- So you're gonna leave him?

257
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,960
- No, i think he may
have a point.

258
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:22,296
You might need to do more
than simply text.

259
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:24,098
- A long, drawn-Out breakup
is just gonna end

260
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:26,367
In a big scene
and marcus crying.

261
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,704
He has so many emotions.

262
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:31,806
- [sobbing]

263
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:36,110
It's just so beautiful
how much they love each other.

264
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:38,112
- It's a commercial

265
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:39,480
For a refrigerator.

266
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:41,115
- Yes, it is daunting.

267
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:43,985
But i did some research
on amicable breakups.

268
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:48,322
I visited
www.Ladiesgoodhealthmag.Com/

269
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:58,389
6-Relationships/867599904/
9432&20. Html.

270
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,135
Do you know that site?
- No.

271
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:03,504
- Well, apparently,
it's less painful

272
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:08,042
If you acknowledge
the dumpee's feelings.

273
00:09:08,075 --> 00:09:09,376
- Ew.
- But don't worry.

274
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,045
We'll practice.
Hmm?

275
00:09:11,078 --> 00:09:13,480
I'll be marcus.
Go.

276
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:14,749
- [clears throat]

277
00:09:14,816 --> 00:09:17,719
Marcus, i think
we should break up.

278
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,353
- That makes me feel sad.

279
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:20,387
I am sad.

280
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,555
- Your sadness is noted.

281
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:23,357
- I feel acknowledged.

282
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,992
Thank you for breaking up
with me.

283
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:28,162
It will take me eight minutes
to collect my things.

284
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:29,363
I think that went very well.

285
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:30,397
- Hmm.

286
00:09:30,431 --> 00:09:31,899
- Okay, creek.

287
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:35,536
I'd like three fresh trout
to go, please.

288
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:37,905
[percussive music]

289
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,240
It just went straight up.

290
00:09:39,273 --> 00:09:41,208
Now it's coming down.
Oh, boy!

291
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:43,544
- Watch and learn, losers.

292
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:45,747
Yah!

293
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:47,548
- I didn't see where it went.
- Back of my neck.

294
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,917
It's in the back of my neck.
[groans]

295
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:53,054
- Okay, i've learned
from your mistakes.

296
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:58,292
Not too hard,
late release, and...

297
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,927
[water splashes]

298
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:01,695
- That was fun.
Fishing was fun.

299
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:02,797
- Yeah.
- Back to the cabin?

300
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:03,898
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

301
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:05,800
- Before we get
into your pitch,

302
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,401
What are you
calling the product?

303
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:11,472
- The handless lighting system,
or hls.

304
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:13,474
- Sounds like
a genetic disorder.

305
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,143
How's about
shoulder nova?

306
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,711
- I love it.
Amazing.

307
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:18,913
It's perfect.

308
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,447
- Now let's talk presentation.

309
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,149
What's your opener?

310
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:24,285
- Hi, i'm amy santiago,

311
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:26,954
And my product will make
a real difference.

312
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:29,323
It is the shoulder nova.

313
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,227
- My only note is, make it
1000% more captivating.

314
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,996
- Very good note.
Yeah.

315
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,297
Okay.

316
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,665
I got it.
[clears throat]

317
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:41,102
Mm...

318
00:10:41,135 --> 00:10:43,170
Ding.

319
00:10:43,237 --> 00:10:47,975
Oh, hello.
I'm amy santiago.

320
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,111
Was that captivating enough?

321
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:53,480
- Weirdly, it might have been
a scooch too captivating.

322
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:55,016
Here's what i'm thinking.

323
00:10:55,082 --> 00:10:57,518
Mm-Kay?
You can take a seat.

324
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,520
- Okay.

325
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:04,225
- Until this moment,
there was only darkness.

326
00:11:04,258 --> 00:11:07,862
But now there is...

327
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:08,930
Light.

328
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:09,931
- [sighs]

329
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,833
- I am vanessa santiago,

330
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,569
And i'm about
to blow your minds.

331
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:17,204
- You want me to change
my name to vanessa?

332
00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:18,906
- Desperately.

333
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,242
- I got to say,
the chinese

334
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:23,244
Know how to make
a terrible scotch.

335
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:24,445
- They certainly do.

336
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,247
Ugh, it's bad.
Gets you drunk, though.

337
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,049
- Well, i found
all the worms.

338
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:30,017
They're eating a fox corpse
in the outhouse.

339
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:32,386
- Speaking of which,
i'm getting hungry.

340
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:34,121
What's for dinner?
- Dinner?

341
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:37,091
[laughs nervously]
yes, of course. Dinner.

342
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:38,425
- Did you not pack any food?

343
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:39,593
- There's fresh fox.

344
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:41,095
- Oh, it is not fresh.

345
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:42,229
- Are you serious?

346
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:43,764
We stopped three times
on the way up here

347
00:11:43,865 --> 00:11:47,034
To buy fireworks, and you
never thought to get groceries?

348
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,235
What was in those coolers?

349
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:49,603
- The fireworks.

350
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:52,139
Look, i thought we would be
incredible at fishing.

351
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,640
Excuse me for
believing in us.

352
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:57,078
- It'll be okay, guys.
No need to worry.

353
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:59,881
I just took a foraging class,
and not to brag,

354
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,648
I was voted mr. Fungus.

355
00:12:01,682 --> 00:12:03,885
- Aha, mr. Fungus
to the rescue.

356
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:05,352
See, sarge, everything's
going to work out,

357
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:06,687
And you don't have to stress
all the time.

358
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,355
- Boyle, you really think
you can find us dinner?

359
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:11,192
- [laughing]
um, let's just say

360
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:13,560
It's gonna be
a "spore-Gasbord."

361
00:12:13,627 --> 00:12:15,162
[percussive music]

362
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,898
- Something bad happened
to charles, didn't it?

363
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:17,965
- Big time.

364
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,500
Oh god,
what if the last thing

365
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,468
We ever heard him say
was "spore-Gasbord?"

366
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:27,108
I'm starting
to get worried, jake.

367
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:28,409
- Relax.

368
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:30,277
If anybody can handle it
out here, it's charles.

369
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:32,413
He saw "into the woods"
ten times in the theater.

370
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:33,948
- Watch it.
That's poison ivy.

371
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,917
- Whoa. Good call.

372
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:37,518
I'm allergic to poison ivy.

373
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:39,086
I got it one time
at sports camp,

374
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,956
Making out in the woods
with liz almont.

375
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:43,790
Okay, fine.
We weren't making out.

376
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:45,126
I was looking
for my inhaler.

377
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:48,629
And it wasn't sports camp.
It was asthma camp.

378
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:51,265
- Hey, jake.
Are we lost?

379
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:52,433
- What? No.

380
00:12:52,466 --> 00:12:54,268
We're on an "adventure."

381
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,436
Right, fun terry?

382
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:56,603
- Fun terry's gone.

383
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:58,305
He starved to death an hour ago.

384
00:12:58,339 --> 00:12:59,773
This is original terry.

385
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,008
- That's the worst terry.

386
00:13:01,042 --> 00:13:03,744
- You didn't bring a map
or a flashlight

387
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:05,779
Or anything that could keep us
from getting lost?

388
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:07,781
- Yes, i brought
all of those things.

389
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:09,183
It's called a cell phone.

390
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:11,218
Map. Flashlight.
Compass.

391
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,853
An app that makes me
sound like t-Pain.

392
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:14,521
Nope, the battery's dead.
Now it's just a brick.

393
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,123
But don't freak out.

394
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,225
I don't need an app
to sound like t-Pain, right?

395
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:22,129
[nasally]
♪ We're totally lost ♪

396
00:13:22,196 --> 00:13:25,032
Yeah, that was a little
more kermit, but—

397
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:28,535
- Oh, you're back.

398
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:29,603
How did the breakup go?

399
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,372
- I tried to acknowledge
his feelings.

400
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:32,974
It wasn't easy.
There were a lot of them.

401
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,977
- I'm just so confused.

402
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:38,612
So sad.

403
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:39,981
Are you climbing
out the window?

404
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:41,148
- No.

405
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:42,783
I climbed back in,
and we talked about emotions

406
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:43,985
For 20 minutes.

407
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,219
- Dear god.
- I know.

408
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:46,287
But i think it went well.

409
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,388
At least there was no crying.

410
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,889
- Well done, diaz.

411
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,624
- I'm actually really glad
you made me do it this way.

412
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:53,995
I got to tell him that
even though it was ending,

413
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:56,163
It was incredibly
meaningful to me,

414
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,831
And i'm gonna miss him.

415
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:59,266
- Oh, no.

416
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,037
- This is exactly
what i didn't want.

417
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,539
- You crying?
Oof!

418
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:06,707
I deserved that.

419
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,842
- Charles is dead,
and we're next.

420
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,911
- All right, don't be
so melodramatic.

421
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,646
He's probably chewing
on bark and berries,

422
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,515
Having the time of his life,
safe and sound.

423
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:16,017
- Terry! Jake!

424
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,085
- Ho, ho!
What's that i hear?

425
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:20,087
Charles boyle,
safe and sound?

426
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:21,422
What are you saying, charles?

427
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:23,090
That you're having
the time of your life?

428
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:25,759
- I fell in a sinkhole,
and i'm badly hurt!

429
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:28,429
- Damn it!

430
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:29,663
Boyle, what the hell?

431
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:31,198
- I know.
It's a pretty big hole, right?

432
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,399
- How'd you end up down there?

433
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,235
- I spotted
a gorgeous chanterelle.

434
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:36,870
I reached for it, but then
i rolled my ankle and fell in.

435
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:38,705
- All right, buddy, don't worry.
We got you, okay?

436
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:40,207
- I was so scared, you guys.

437
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:41,908
A psychic told me i was
gonna die alone in a pit,

438
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:43,377
And i kept telling myself,

439
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,379
"this is a hole, not a pit.
This is a hole, not a pit.

440
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:46,613
"this is a hole, not a pit.

441
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,748
"this is a hole,
not a pit.

442
00:14:47,781 --> 00:14:48,882
Charles, it's a hole,
not a pit."

443
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:51,685
- All right.
Here, grab me.

[grunts]

445
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,188
Take my hand, all right?

446
00:14:54,221 --> 00:14:55,889
- Okay.

447
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:57,791
- Okay, now pull us up,
terry.

448
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,260
- Oh crap, i'm slipping!

- [groaning]

00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:05,966
- No, it's lohank's dogs
all over again!

452
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:08,269
- So in conclusion,

453
00:15:08,302 --> 00:15:10,104
By eliminating
flashlight fumbling,

454
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:12,673
The shoulder nova could save
the average police officer

455
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:14,641
Over 13,000 seconds.

456
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:18,079
- Wow, that sounds like
a lot, vanessa.

457
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,280
- It is.

458
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:22,383
- I guess there's only
one thing left to do.

459
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,851
Both: you have the right
to remain...

460
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:26,287
- Uhh!

461
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,821
Both: well lit!

462
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,290
[clapping]

463
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:31,358
- Wow, that presentation
was terrific.

464
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:32,693
So fun to watch.

465
00:15:32,726 --> 00:15:33,694
- Thank you, sir.

466
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,129
- See, the problem
is the product.

467
00:15:35,162 --> 00:15:36,830
I just don't see
any need for it at all.

468
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:38,299
I just put the flashlight
in my mouth

469
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:39,366
When my hands are full.

470
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,468
- Sir, the human mouth
is nasty.

471
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:42,869
- Yeah, but mouths are free.

472
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:45,139
I'm sorry.
I'm just not interested.

473
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:48,675
- Okay.
Thank you for your time.

474
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:55,015
- You are scum.

475
00:15:55,116 --> 00:15:56,583
[scraping]

476
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,751
- This isn't working.

477
00:15:57,818 --> 00:15:59,920
- Great trip, jake.
- Oh, thanks, man.

478
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:01,122
- You know that was
sarcastic!

479
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:02,156
- How?

480
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:03,457
- You didn't bring food
or water

481
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,226
Or ask if lohank's cabin

482
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:06,727
Was straight out
of a horror movie.

483
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,162
Now you got us
trapped in a pit!

484
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,263
- Hole.

485
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:10,564
- Okay, i know
that things

486
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:11,965
Are not looking great
right now,

487
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,634
But you have to admit,
you were having fun earlier.

488
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:16,303
- I'm not now.
I'm more stressed than ever.

489
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:17,604
- Maybe that's 'cause
you're just focusing

490
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:19,173
On the negative, ter-Bear.
I mean, look at charles.

491
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,674
He's chill.
I'm chill.

492
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:23,009
- That's 'cause he's in shock!
You know what?

493
00:16:23,144 --> 00:16:24,511
The reason you're so chill

494
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:27,348
Is because you have everyone
cleaning up your messes for you.

495
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:29,850
Didn't bring food?
Charles will find mushrooms.

496
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,186
Smashed through a window?
Terry'll do the paperwork.

497
00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:33,654
- Hey, i did the paperwork.

498
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:35,189
- No, amy did it!

499
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,657
- Oh, guys, please,
please calm down.

500
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,159
I hate it when you argue.

501
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,993
It reminds of when my dad
used to fight

502
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,329
With my best friend—
my mom.

503
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,830
- I'm done with this.

504
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:45,332
I'm going to sleep.

505
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:46,467
Charles, spoon with me.

506
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,934
We need to huddle
together for warmth.

507
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:49,503
- No, charles,
you're my best friend.

508
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:50,704
You're going
to spoon with me.

509
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:51,872
- I called first spoon.

510
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:53,207
Charles, get over here
right now.

511
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:55,342
- Boyle, don't throw away
a lifelong friendship

512
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,843
For a one-Night spoon
with terry.

513
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,345
- Okay, enough.
We're gonna stop fighting.

514
00:16:58,379 --> 00:16:59,613
We're gonna lie down,

515
00:16:59,646 --> 00:17:01,615
And we're gonna triple-Spoon
like grown-Ups!

516
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:04,418
Come on, bring it in.
Bring it in.

517
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:07,188
[dramatic music]

518
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:08,422
There, okay.

519
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,791
See, that's better, right?

520
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:12,759
So do we know any songs?

521
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:14,027
Both: shut up, charles!

522
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,734
- Jake?
Where's jake?

523
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,403
Did you eat him, terry?

524
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:23,537
- No!

525
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,473
- Good morning, guys!

526
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:27,741
- How'd you get out of the pit?

527
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:29,410
- Easy-Peasy,
lemon squeezy.

528
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:31,011
Actually, it took me hours.

529
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:33,580
I tied all my clothes together,
tethered them to a log,

530
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:35,216
And used it
as a grappling hook.

531
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:36,817
Managed to snag it
in a root.

532
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,918
- Aren't you freezing?

533
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:38,919
- Not at all.

534
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:40,887
Mainly because
my skin is on fire

535
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,556
From all the poison ivy
in this tree.

536
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:43,657
[giggles]

537
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,758
- Why'd you do that?

538
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,727
Oh, let me guess.
Dumb mistake.

539
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,363
- No, dumb choice.

540
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:51,031
I didn't want to sit around
and wait for somebody

541
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:52,233
To clean up my mess.

542
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,934
- Hmm, i guess
i got through to you.

543
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,402
- Yeah.

544
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:58,439
Also, after you fell asleep,
boyle really laid into me.

545
00:17:58,505 --> 00:17:59,440
It was brutal.

546
00:17:59,506 --> 00:18:01,242
- I got to say, jake,
this time,

547
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:03,477
I think you're
only 99% right.

548
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,246
- [gasps]

549
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,813
- We're rolling.
- No!

550
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:08,815
Argh!

551
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:10,150
[groans]

552
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:11,952
- Well, can you see anything
from up there?

553
00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:13,254
- Yes, i can—

554
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:16,490
Stink puddle manor,
about 65 trees sunward.

555
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:17,791
Man, one day in the woods,

556
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:19,860
And i'm freakin'
lewis and clark up here.

557
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:21,628
[door rattles]
- Thank you for coming, diaz.

558
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:23,430
I want to apologize
for yesterday.

559
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:26,132
Inserting myself into
my employee's breakup

560
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,470
With my nephew somehow,
uh, backfired.

561
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,937
- It's not your fault.

562
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:34,541
I'm the one that made a scene
like a dumb, crying baby.

563
00:18:34,608 --> 00:18:36,777
I'm considering having
my tear ducts melted shut.

564
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,681
- It's not the end
of the world to feel...

565
00:18:40,714 --> 00:18:41,782
Things.

566
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:42,849
- I guess not.

567
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:44,184
It's up there.

568
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:46,553
The thing is,
i really care about marcus,

569
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,154
But he wanted to get married,

570
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:50,857
And i'm just not
ready for that.

571
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:53,360
And if i'm not ready
with a guy as great as marcus,

572
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:56,963
Then what if i'm never ready?

573
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,299
[voice breaking]
what if that was it,

574
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:01,101
My one chance at love?

575
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:04,037
What if i never get
a second chance?

576
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,542
I don't know.
I'm just...

577
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:10,210
I'm just sad.

578
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:14,448
- Well, i understand.

579
00:19:14,481 --> 00:19:16,917
It must be very difficult.

580
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,421
- Wait, are you crying?

581
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:23,324
- Yes.

582
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:24,391
[sighs]

583
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:26,059
Thank you for acknowledging
my feelings.

584
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:28,329
- Thank you for
acknowledging mine.

585
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:30,831
[both sobbing]

586
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:34,067
- We're both great at this.
- [sobs and sniffles]

587
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,903
- Hey, sport.

588
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:38,839
You look a little d in the d.

589
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:41,675
D for "down in dumps,"
respectively.

590
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:43,344
- Probably easier
to just not abbreviate

591
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,411
If you have to explain it.

592
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,846
- Agree to d.

593
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:47,581
I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday.

594
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:51,585
- Yeah, thank you for all
your help with the presentation.

595
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:53,454
And i'm sorry you had
to waste your talent

596
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,121
On such a stupid product.

597
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:56,790
- Without product makers
like you,

598
00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:58,592
Us dazzle-Doves
wouldn't have nothing

599
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,960
To shake our wings over.

600
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:02,162
- Yeah, but my invention
was useless.

601
00:20:02,195 --> 00:20:04,365
- No, that scum was wrong.

602
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:07,033
I showed the shoulder nova
to a girl in my building.

603
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,870
She's like a mini amy,
and she loved it.

604
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:12,005
She said she was gonna break
the world record

605
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:13,039
For speed-Reading.

606
00:20:13,106 --> 00:20:14,475
- Psh! Yeah.

607
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:17,310
Like some little girl's gonna
take down yuri jurgonav.

608
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:19,480
[both laugh]

609
00:20:19,513 --> 00:20:22,383
- Anyway, i know
it wasn't what you wanted,

610
00:20:22,449 --> 00:20:24,951
But you still made
a difference.

611
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:26,987
- Thanks, gina.

612
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,356
I guess i did
make a d.

613
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,191
- Don't steal my thing.
- Okay.

614
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:33,560
- That's all i ask.
- I won't.

615
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:34,995
- Hey, sarge.

616
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,798
Why'd you want us
to meet you out here?

617
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,199
- To thank you guys
for the weekend.

618
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:41,702
- Really?
It was a total disaster.

619
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:42,903
- Not a total disaster.

620
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:44,738
None of us got sick
from that dog water.

621
00:20:44,805 --> 00:20:47,140
- You drank that?
- No.

622
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:49,376
- Look, jake,
you were right.

623
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,912
I have kind of forgotten
how to have fun.

624
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:54,715
I'm going to try
to work on that, so...

625
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:56,082
- [gasps]

626
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:57,718
The fireworks
you made me surrender

627
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,486
When we reentered
new york!

628
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,723
- Uh-Huh.
Fun terry's back.

629
00:21:02,756 --> 00:21:05,091
We're gonna set 'em off
in a big pile, all at once.

630
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,793
- By shooting our guns
at them?

631
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:08,562
- What? No.
- No.

632
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,130
- We're going to set 'em off
like normal people.

633
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:12,165
- Oh.
That's good too.

634
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:15,101
Ooh.

635
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,770
[fuse crackling]

636
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:17,971
Here we go.

637
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:19,473
[fireworks popping]
whoo-Hoo!

638
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:20,807
[fireworks crackling
and whistling]

639
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:22,275
See how fun this is?

640
00:21:22,308 --> 00:21:24,110
Original terry
would have been worried

641
00:21:24,144 --> 00:21:27,113
That we're standing too close
and need safety goggles,

642
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:28,449
And he would have been
absolutely right.

643
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:29,616
We're way too close.
Run!

644
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,817
[fireworks booming]

645
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,821
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
