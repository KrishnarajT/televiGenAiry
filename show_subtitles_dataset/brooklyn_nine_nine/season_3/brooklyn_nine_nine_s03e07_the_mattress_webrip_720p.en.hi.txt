355
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,654
Coming on a little
strong there, buddy...

356
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:51,655
and I'm digging it.

357
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,157
How much to take
this bad boy home?

358
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,259
- Actually, that's one of our
more reasonable models.

359
00:10:55,326 --> 00:10:56,994
- Oh. Holy Moses!

360
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:58,996
That is much too much money.

361
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,564
- Well, you spent twice that

362
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:02,399
for Mr. Met to come
to your birthday party.

363
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,968
- Yeah, and it was worth it.

364
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:05,837
Mr. Met used my bathroom.
Number two.

365
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:08,139
That's a memory
I will cherish forever.

366
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:10,507
- Look, mattresses
are expensive,

367
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:11,742
but they're an investment.

368
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:13,510
It's gonna be in your life
for a long time.

369
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:16,413
- True, but it's also
still just a mattress, you know?

370
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:18,115
It's a lot of money
to spend on a rectangle

371
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,851
that's filled with springs
and goose hair.

372
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,318
- You know it's feathers.
- I didn't.

373
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:23,120
- And it would be
money well spent,

374
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,522
because it would allow me
to actually sleep in your bed.

375
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:26,858
- But I already have
a mattress.

376
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,125
It just doesn't seem worth it.

377
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,127
- Okay, well, to me,

378
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:32,196
it sounds like you're saying
I'm not worth it.

379
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:34,698
So I'm gonna go sleep
in my grown-up mattress

380
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:35,933
that I bought this century,

381
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,534
and you're not invited.

382
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,039
- You know, she's right about
mattresses being an investment.

383
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,107
- Back off, Brian.

384
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:49,446
- Morning.

385
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:51,983
You look well-rested.

386
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:55,086
- Yes, because I slept
in my own bed.

387
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,287
- I was tossing
and turning.

388
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,588
Jake told me
about your fight,

389
00:11:57,621 --> 00:11:59,223
and I'm so worried
about you two.

390
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:00,291
- Thank you, Charles.

391
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:01,292
- What do I have to do,

392
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:02,293
buy the mattress myself?

393
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:03,294
Done.

394
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:04,295
- Problem solved.
- No.

395
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:05,396
- It would make him
so happy.

396
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:06,797
- Good job on the bust
yesterday.

397
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:08,799
How was it, working together
as a couple?

398
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,901
- So good.
- So great.

399
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,168
- Yeah.
- Super mellow and chill.

400
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:12,303
- Yeah.

401
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:13,504
- She slapped my butt once.
- Mm-hmm.

402
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:14,805
- We're definitely
falling in love.

403
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,307
- All right.
- Good, good, good.

404
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,375
We found something strange
on the dealer you brought in:

405
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,011
two matchbooks
from the same hotel.

406
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,913
He's refusing to give up
his supplier,

407
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:23,647
but this could be something.

408
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,982
- That's weird.
Look at this.

409
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:27,318
The same two matches
are missing from both books:

410
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:29,486
third one on the bottom row,
and fifth one from the top.

411
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,821
- Coincidence?
- No way.

412
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:32,689
No one would
take matches out like that.

413
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:34,525
Trust me; I smoked
four cigarettes in college.

414
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:35,526
One to completion.

415
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,928
That's a code.

416
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:37,929
- A code?

417
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,063
Exciting.

418
00:12:39,096 --> 00:12:40,932
I'll go get my pencil case.

419
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:42,166
- I bet it's a room number.

420
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,400
Third floor, fifth room.

421
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:44,501
Room 305.

422
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:46,070
- That's definitely it.
- Well, great.

423
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:47,071
Great, great.

424
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:49,773
Santiago has solved it.

425
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,342
I want you two
to go undercover

426
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,010
as a couple
to stake out the room.

427
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:54,278
You should be
very convincing,

428
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:55,446
given that you're currently—

429
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:56,780
what was it?

430
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:58,015
"Smooshing booties."

431
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,617
- Great, and thank you
for saying it that way.

432
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,453
It made us both
feel very comfortable.

433
00:13:02,486 --> 00:13:04,355
- Sure did.

434
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,190
♪ ♪

435
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:08,025
- Hey, I've been
looking for you.

436
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,127
Before you decide
what to do with Sam,

437
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,363
there's someone I think
you should talk to.

438
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:16,300
- Ms. Miriam.

439
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,668
- Surprise!

440
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:19,770
I tracked down
your old ballet coach.

441
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:22,339
I brought her in
to remind you of the effect

442
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:26,343
a kind, nurturing presence
can have on a young life.

443
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:27,811
- Hello, dear.

444
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,180
Have you continued to dance?

445
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:30,514
- No, Ms. Miriam.

446
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:31,983
- Well, there's
no surprise in that.

447
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,384
You always were a lazy ox.

448
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,552
- What's this now?
- Look at your posture.

449
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:38,555
You look as if you should be
ringing the bells at Notre Dame.

450
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:40,857
- Ms. Miriam was not
nurturing at all.

451
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:42,159
- All right, ox.

452
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,360
Let's see what you've got.

453
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:46,363
Five, six, seven, eight.

454
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:48,065
Eyes up.

455
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:50,201
Shoulders down.

456
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:51,902
Well, that wasn't terrible.

457
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:52,903
- See, Sarge?

458
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:54,338
Tough love works.

459
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:55,339
- Damn it!

460
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:57,574
Terry proved the wrong point.

461
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:00,411
- Aw, Chuckles.

462
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:02,779
You're looking even more
broken than usual.

463
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:04,248
- Yeah, I should have never

464
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:06,583
have tried to stand up
to Captain Holt.

465
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:08,285
Why didn't I just beg for mercy?

466
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,786
It's my signature move:

467
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,155
"The Charles."

468
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:13,790
- No, you are actually
in the right in this sitch.

469
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:15,626
The captain
is being irrational.

470
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:18,462
But he's about to learn
himself a lesson.

471
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:20,664
Right about...

472
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:25,436
Nah...

473
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:26,437
- Oh, my!

474
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,438
- Ow.

475
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:28,605
Timed it perfectly.

476
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,441
- What?

477
00:14:30,474 --> 00:14:33,610
- What did you do
to my cupcake?

478
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:34,911
- This is yours?

479
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:37,148
Why on Earth is your cupcake
on my chair?

480
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:38,582
- Because it's very
special to me,

481
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:40,851
so I can put it
wherever I want.

482
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:42,486
This is your fault.

483
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,288
Now you have to buy me
a new cupcake.

484
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,256
- This is outrageous.

485
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,191
You expect me to avoid—

486
00:14:47,258 --> 00:14:49,260
oh, I see.

487
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,295
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, you do.

488
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:53,297
The cupcake was Gertie.
- Yes.

489
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,332
- Your butt was Charles's car.
- Yes.

490
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:56,667
- The chair
was the parking space.

491
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,768
- Yes, I get it.

492
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,070
- Your office was the garage.

493
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:00,937
- Yes, I'm telling you
I understand the lesson.

494
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:04,741
- And I was the brilliant
Gina Linetti in both scenarios.

495
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:06,210
- All right.
We're done here.

496
00:15:06,243 --> 00:15:07,411
- 'Kay.

497
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:10,781
- You're a great captain.

498
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,218
- Jake, why don't you
just sit down?

499
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:15,286
- No, thank you.

500
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:16,720
I can see the feed better
from here.

501
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,522
- It's really comfortable.

502
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:20,857
- All right.
I'll sit.

503
00:15:22,226 --> 00:15:23,427
[sighs]

504
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,129
Nope, my butt
hates expensive things.

505
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:26,130
- No.

506
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:27,364
You know what your butt hates?

507
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:29,433
Making any sort of
sacrifice for us,

508
00:15:29,466 --> 00:15:31,635
because it's not serious
about this relationship.

509
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:33,970
- Okay, first of all,
my butt is so serious

510
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:35,439
it should be wearing
spectacles.

511
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:36,807
And second, your butt
is the butt

512
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:38,642
that is not serious
about this relationship.

513
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:39,643
- [scoffs]

514
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,645
My butt is totally serious.

515
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:43,280
I've made all kinds of changes.

516
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,149
I bought orange soda for you.

517
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,417
- Okay!

518
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,818
For the last time,

519
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:50,887
Orangina is not orange soda.

520
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,823
- Yeah, because it's better.

521
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:55,126
- Uh, okay, now you're
just being crazy.

522
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,294
- Ugh, you're not even taking
this argument seriously.

523
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:58,795
- All right.
You want to get serious?

524
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:01,132
How come you haven't told
your mom that we're dating?

525
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,399
Yeah, that's right.

526
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:04,135
I saw the text she sent you
about setting you up

527
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:05,136
with some dude named Gary.

528
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,303
- You read my texts?

529
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:07,838
- It buzzed when you were
in the bathroom.

530
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:09,806
Who doesn't bring their phone
with them into the bathroom?

531
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,342
That's, like, the whole reason
to go in there.

532
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,377
- I haven't told her because
I haven't had the chance.

533
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,411
- What?

534
00:16:14,478 --> 00:16:15,479
You talk to her, like,
every week.

535
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:16,547
You basically stalk her.

536
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,814
Why don't you just admit

537
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:19,716
that you don't want
to tell her about me?

538
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,718
- Jake, it's not about you.

539
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:24,355
Look; the minute I tell her
that I'm dating someone,

540
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:26,022
she's gonna call me
all the time

541
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:28,259
and ask me a million
annoying questions.

542
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:30,694
- Wow, it sounds like
such a huge drag.

543
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:32,696
I guess I'm just not
"worth it."

544
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:34,030
Boom—used the thing
you said to me

545
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,399
in a different argument
in this argument.

546
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:36,400
I win the argument.

547
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,169
- Oh, no, no, no.
This is bad.

548
00:16:38,202 --> 00:16:39,736
- Well, you started it...
or I did.

549
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,405
I can't remember at this point.
- No, Jake.

550
00:16:41,438 --> 00:16:42,906
Look at the screen.

551
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,708
- Oh, no.

552
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:48,912
For the last time,
Orangina is not orange soda.

553
00:16:48,945 --> 00:16:50,681
- Yeah, because it's better.

554
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:53,784
- Uh, okay, now you're just
being crazy.

555
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,919
- You're not even
taking this—

556
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:57,754
- You do have to admit,
it was a pretty good point

557
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,190
about Orangina, though.

558
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:08,699
- Your turn, Peralta.

559
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:10,534
- Thank you, Santiago.

560
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:13,704
Okay.

561
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:17,341
I know you're mad,
but before you say anything,

562
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:18,942
yes, we screwed up.

563
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:20,544
And yes, you warned us.

564
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,946
And yes, I don't know
where I'm going with this.

565
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:24,681
But I do know this:

566
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:26,717
I have reached
the end of my sentence.

567
00:17:28,719 --> 00:17:29,686
Oh, my God. Did that work?

568
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,021
- Not at all.
- Oh.

569
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:33,790
I can't believe
you let a personal argument

570
00:17:33,824 --> 00:17:35,659
derail your investigation.

571
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:36,993
- I would characterize it more

572
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:39,029
as a professional
police disagreement.

573
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:40,564
- I listened to the tape.
- Oh, no.

574
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:42,566
Yeah, well, then you know
that it was a straight-up

575
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:43,867
crazy bitch fight.

576
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,969
Look; I know we screwed up
the case, and I'm sorry.

577
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:47,338
But if it's any consolation,

578
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:49,873
I think we also screwed up
our relationship.

579
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:51,242
- Peralta, have a seat.

580
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:53,244
I believe this might help.

581
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:55,145
When Kevin and I
first started dating,

582
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,080
he taught at a small
college upstate.

583
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:59,483
It was two hours away
by train or bus,

584
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:01,418
but only 30 minutes by car.

585
00:18:01,452 --> 00:18:02,919
- Is this another one
of your riddles?

586
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:04,621
You rode to work
on his shoulders.

587
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:06,557
One set of footprints. No?

588
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,058
- No.
- Okay.

589
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:09,426
- Neither of us owned a car,

590
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,328
and I didn't want to buy one
because that would mean

591
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:12,929
admitting that
I cared for Kevin.

592
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:15,332
He had the same fear,
and so visits were rare,

593
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,600
and I was miserable.

594
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:19,270
Then one spring day,
Kevin showed up at my door

595
00:18:19,303 --> 00:18:21,272
having purchased Gertie.

596
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:24,275
He took the leap,
and I'm so grateful that he did.

597
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:27,611
I only regret that I didn't
do it first.

598
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:29,280
Do you understand?

599
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,282
- Absolutely.

600
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:32,449
100%.

601
00:18:32,483 --> 00:18:33,517
- The train is your
old mattress.

602
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:34,785
- Yeah.
- The car is your new mattress.

603
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:35,786
- I got it.
- Kevin is you.

604
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:36,953
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm Santiago.

605
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:38,855
- Loud and clear.
100%.

606
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:41,325
[clangs]

607
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:42,459
- So I took care of Sam.

608
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:43,460
- Uh-oh.

609
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:44,495
That sounds ominous,

610
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:46,930
like you went
all Ms. Miriam on him.

611
00:18:46,963 --> 00:18:48,198
- I let him off with a warning.

612
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,466
See, thing about Ms. Miriam

613
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,502
is she made me a good dancer,

614
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:54,104
but she ruined
my childhood.

615
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:56,440
She was constantly riding me
about my posture

616
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:58,141
and my technique
and my pink hair.

617
00:18:58,174 --> 00:18:59,476
- Pink hair.
- Never speak of that.

618
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,777
- Copy.

619
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:02,613
- She's the reason
I quit ballet,

620
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:03,914
and I sure as hell
don't want Sam

621
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,517
to quit the Big Brother program
'cause of me.

622
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,519
- This is totally

623
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:12,423
how I thought this Ms. Miriam
thing was gonna go.

624
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:15,225
Another flawless Terry plan.

625
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:16,860
- Boyle, I thought
you should know.

626
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:18,695
I just got Gertie back
from the garage.

627
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:20,431
She looks as good as new.

628
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:22,032
Better, even,
because after 12 years,

629
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:23,734
they finally got
the Annie Lennox cassette

630
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:24,735
out of the tape player.

631
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:26,202
- Oh, I love her.

632
00:19:26,236 --> 00:19:27,771
Here's a check
for the full amount.

633
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:31,475
- You don't owe me anything.

634
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:34,210
It was my fault,
and I behaved poorly,

635
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,613
as Gina made abundantly clear.

636
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,048
- Oh, speaking of,

637
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,884
you still owe me $14
for that cupcake.

638
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,486
- Hey.
- Hey.

639
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:43,720
- What's up?

640
00:19:43,754 --> 00:19:44,721
- Two things.

641
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,122
I ran the footage
from the hotel

642
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:48,359
through facial recognition
software and got a match:

643
00:19:48,392 --> 00:19:49,993
Grady Lamont.

644
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,828
This is his current address.

645
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:52,829
- That's good, I guess.

646
00:19:52,896 --> 00:19:54,164
- Yeah, it's six years old.

647
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,232
- Well, druggies are lazy?

648
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:57,368
- He deals in uppers.

649
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:58,502
- We're screwed.
- Yup.

650
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,437
- What's the second thing?

651
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:02,172
- Well, the Captain and I
were jamming

652
00:20:02,238 --> 00:20:04,675
on some personal issues,
just going back and forth.

653
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,310
I honestly think I helped him
more than he helped me.

654
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:09,079
- I'm not buying any of that.
- No.

655
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,349
[sighs]

656
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,485
Amy Santiago...

657
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,186
I want to change mattresses
for you.

658
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,490
- That's the best thing
I've ever heard.

659
00:20:19,523 --> 00:20:21,324
- I'm sorry I didn't
do it sooner.

660
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:24,327
I think I was just scared
that you were gonna realize

661
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,829
you're way better than me.

662
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:29,299
Like, you're Orangina,
and I'm orange soda.

663
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,534
- Are you kidding?

664
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:31,802
You're Orangina.

665
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:32,803
- Ugh.

666
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:33,970
Don't say that.

667
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:35,672
- Look.

668
00:20:35,706 --> 00:20:37,774
I was scared too.

669
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:39,042
I'm gonna call my mom tonight.

670
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,547
- Okay.

671
00:20:43,614 --> 00:20:45,549
Let's buy this baby.

672
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:47,784
Calling up the website,

673
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:49,520
finding the mattress,

674
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:51,287
adding to cart,

675
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:52,789
signing in as "guest"...

676
00:20:52,823 --> 00:20:54,491
That is not an option.

677
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:55,992
Creating an account...

678
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,694
- You don't have to buy it
right this second.

679
00:20:57,728 --> 00:20:59,329
- Nope, this is a big
romantic gesture,

680
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:00,731
and I'm nailing it.

681
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:03,434
Shipping address—
not the same as billing address.

682
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:05,068
Got to enter both of those.

683
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:06,903
- Jake, Jake, look!
There's our guy.

684
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:08,238
- Oh, perfect timing.

685
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:09,440
Submit order.

686
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,574
Province? Oh, no.

687
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:11,742
We're on the Canadian website.

688
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:12,909
Click on the American flag.

689
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:13,944
- Jake!
- Yeah.

690
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:14,978
We'll do this later.
Let's go!

691
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:16,547
- Not a doctor. Shh!
