00:16:58,235 --> 00:16:59,570
- Well, the key is trust.

524
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,305
I trust her to stay
out of danger,

525
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:02,539
And she trusts me
not to interfere.

526
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:03,707
- Oh, my god.

527
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,742
She just pushed figgis
into the garbage.

528
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:07,311
- She's in danger.
I must interfere.

529
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:13,884
- Showing my unborn baby
how an ass gets kicked.

530
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,086
- [growls]

531
00:17:15,086 --> 00:17:16,553
- All right, cortez,
time for your checkup.

532
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,888
- [sighs]
no, thank you, i feel fine.

533
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,156
- No, you don't.

534
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,558
It's your uterus,
it's... Gonna explode.

535
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:22,993
- What?
- Come with me.

536
00:17:23,094 --> 00:17:25,396
Stand back, everyone.
You're all in the splash zone.

537
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,098
- [groans]
- This ute's gonna boot.

538
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,399
Here we go.

539
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,966
- [sighs]
- What the hell?

540
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,502
We agreed you weren't
gonna do that.

541
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:33,404
You disobeyed a direct order
from your handler.

542
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,906
- Yeah, i did.
Because that order was crap.

543
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,208
I did the right thing

544
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:38,475
And it's insulting
that you don't see that.

545
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:39,876
- Hey, hey, hey.

546
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,478
The baby can hear you yelling
and it's upsetting him.

547
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:42,913
- It's a fake baby,
charles.

548
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,181
- I meant me.
The baby's a cover.

549
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:45,349
- Okay, stop.

550
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:48,685
You're right.
I'm 100% in the wrong.

551
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:51,021
The truth is,
i'm the one

552
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:52,823
That's not tough enough
to be in here.

553
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:54,125
I mean, watching
the woman i love,

554
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:57,494
Unarmed, locked up
with all these murderers.

555
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:59,563
It's just too much for me.

556
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:01,798
- Oh, my god.
Amy, go to him.

557
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,135
- I screwed up.
- No, you didn't.

558
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:05,469
I get it.

559
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,304
Being a cop and dating a cop—

560
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,506
It's harder than i thought
it would be.

561
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:10,774
I worry about you too.

562
00:18:10,807 --> 00:18:12,276
- Oh, my god.
Jake, go to her.

563
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,278
- Look, i was just
trying to keep you safe,

564
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:15,979
But i wasn't letting you
do your job.

565
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,148
I'm sorry.

566
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:18,615
- Why aren't you
going to each other?

567
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,017
- I think i have to take myself
off of this assignment.

568
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:22,153
- Are you sure?

569
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,987
- Absolutely.
You got this.

570
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,322
Hopefully, i haven't already
blown your cover

571
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:26,290
By dragging you
into my office

572
00:18:26,323 --> 00:18:27,791
So many times.

573
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:29,593
Also, i'm pretty sure
a lot of people heard me say

574
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,428
That your baby's
blood type is "og."

575
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:32,963
- Yeah, you're a pretty
terrible doctor.

576
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,331
- Mm-Hmm.

577
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:37,434
- But... I think i know
how to get things back on track.

578
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:41,172
- Hey, cortez, you're late
for your appointment.

579
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:42,539
- Quit touching me.

580
00:18:42,606 --> 00:18:44,275
- Oh!
Ugh!

581
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:45,476
- [grunts]

582
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,178
I don't need checkups
every two seconds,

583
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,545
You dimple-Chinned freak!

584
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:50,013
- Oh!
Aah—ow!

585
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,649
You're so tough and i'm
just a beautiful intellectual.

586
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:53,650
- [grunts]
- Hey,

587
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:55,186
I love beating up doctors.

588
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:57,020
Can i get in there?
- No! He's mine.

589
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,789
All of you, back off!

590
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:00,191
I'm kicking for two.

591
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:03,093
- [yelling, groaning]

592
00:19:03,194 --> 00:19:05,061
- Sorry that wasn't
scar-Joe.

593
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:06,630
- I don't want
to talk about it.

594
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,199
Talking about your feelings
is for losers.

595
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,202
- I guess adele's a loser
in your world.

596
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:12,969
Look, the funeral's
almost over,

597
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:14,305
We basically pulled it off.

598
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,473
All you've got to do
is give a convincing eulogy.

599
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,474
- Roger that.

600
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,410
Pimento's dead.

601
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:21,578
Thanks for coming.

602
00:19:27,784 --> 00:19:29,253
[sighs]

603
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:34,325
Adrian pimento
was very special to me.

604
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:37,060
And now he's gone.

605
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,597
And i'm starting to realize...

606
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:44,635
There's nothing i can do
to bring him back.

607
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:47,838
I guess life is just
gonna suck for a while.

608
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:51,975
But it's nice to know
there's a room full of people

609
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:54,010
Who is sucks for too.

610
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:55,479
I'd also like to add...

611
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,581
The next person who hugs me
gets their necks snapped.

612
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,083
- And... She's back.

613
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:03,019
- Okay, this is it,
i'm leaving.

614
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:04,421
You're in charge.

615
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:05,922
- I'll take extra good
care of her, jake.

616
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,758
- Just let her do her thing.

617
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,426
But this is texas,
so also make sure

618
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,194
She doesn't somehow get
the death penalty.

619
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:12,529
- Mm-Hmm.

620
00:20:12,596 --> 00:20:14,431
- Stay tough, cortez.

621
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,033
- You're touching her boob.
Should i turn away, or...

622
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,035
- I'm not touching her boob.
She's tiny on the screen.

623
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:20,337
I'm just saying good-Bye,
man.

624
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:21,705
- You know, why don't i turn
and give you privacy?

625
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:24,341
- No, don't turn.
That's what makes it weird.

626
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,876
Ugh!

627
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:29,280
[upbeat music]

628
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,348
- Well, we pulled it off.

629
00:20:31,382 --> 00:20:32,849
Nice eulogy.

630
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,217
- I thought it was dumb.
- Sergeant?

631
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,652
- Excuse me?

632
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:36,853
- You said there's nothing
you can do to bring him back,

633
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,289
But you're wrong.

634
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:40,791
None of us are gonna stop
fighting until he comes home.

635
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,025
- Thanks.

636
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:43,360
- And if you ever need
to talk,

637
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:44,728
Or get drunk,

638
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:46,330
Or throw stuff off a roof,

639
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:48,064
I mean,
i don't know your process.

640
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:49,366
Am i hitting on anything here?

641
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,701
- The roof thing
sounds pretty good.

642
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:52,035
- Very well. Let's throw
something off the roof

643
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:54,070
And then
we'll get back to work.

644
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:55,472
High five.

645
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,908
I quite like them now.

646
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:07,384
- What are you looking at?
You got a problem?

647
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:09,586
- Whoa.
Cool it, killer.

648
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,954
I just wanted to say
good job

649
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:13,324
On beating the crap
out of that doctor.

650
00:21:13,324 --> 00:21:14,791
- Oh.
Thanks.

651
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:17,494
- I like you.
You got balls.

652
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:19,430
Maybe you should come
work for me.

653
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:22,132
I could use a bruiser
on my crew.

654
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:23,934
- I'm not a bruiser.

655
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,101
I'm a psycho.

656
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:26,903
- Even better.

657
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,839
- Nice job, cortez.

658
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:31,074
Oh, i touched her boob.
I've got to tell jake!

659
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:32,476
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
