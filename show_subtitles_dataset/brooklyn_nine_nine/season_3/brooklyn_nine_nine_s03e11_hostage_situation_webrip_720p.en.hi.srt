assume the worst.

182
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:35,599
That's all i'm saying.

183
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:36,868
- Then why did you
bring up the mail thing?

184
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:37,935
- I don't...

185
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,404
- Hello, chunk.

186
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:41,939
Heard you want your sperm.

187
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:43,240
You gonna have to
go through me.

188
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,309
- Oh, no, this is way worse
than the mail thing.

189
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:46,477
- What mail thing?

190
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:47,879
- Nothing.
There's no mail thing.

191
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,546
There's no mail thing.
But it's my sperm.

192
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,248
How did you even
find out i wanted it?

193
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,050
- Because the account's
under my name.

194
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,385
Storage facility
called me saying

195
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:56,087
That you were looking
to make a withdrawal.

196
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,589
So i went ahead
and withdrew it for you.

197
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:01,125
[whispers]
i have all of your sperm.

198
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,894
- But you don't even
care about it, eleanor.

199
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,195
I mean, remember?

200
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:05,462
"oh, hey, charles,

201
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:06,998
"i'll never have
a baby with you

202
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:08,199
"because i don't love you,

203
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,134
And a child's
not gonna fix that!"

204
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:12,203
- Oof, when he started
doing the silly voice,

205
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,906
I thought it was gonna be
more fun, but... Wasn't.

206
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:15,973
- Well, i do not want your dna.

207
00:06:15,973 --> 00:06:16,974
I want something else.

208
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:18,509
I hit some dumbass with my car.

209
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:20,311
Now he's suing me.

210
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,546
What i want is for you
to use your badge

211
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:25,182
And your gun to intimidate him
into dropping the case.

212
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:27,718
- Wow.
That is so very illegal.

213
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:29,153
He's not doing that.

214
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:30,154
- I don't care.

215
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:32,489
You have 48 hours to do so,

216
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:33,991
Or i'm gonna
take your sperm,

217
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:36,527
And i'm gonna dump it
into the east river.

218
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:37,528
- Please don't do that.

219
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,430
- And there will never be

220
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,767
The possibility
of a little pie-Faced

221
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,669
Charles boyle, jr.

222
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,204
- Proud of it; it's me.

223
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:50,674
She can't do that.
Can she do that?

224
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:51,675
- Stay calm.

225
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:52,676
We're gonna talk
to a lawyer

226
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:53,945
And get
a professional opinion.

227
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:55,379
- Damn.

228
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,381
I can't believe
you signed this contract.

229
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:59,516
The sperm is her
legal possession.

230
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:01,518
It also says that, she—
and i quote—

231
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,254
"owns your dignity."

232
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:04,956
You initialed
right next to that.

233
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:07,524
- Oh, no, jake,
this is a total disaster!

234
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:10,161
I'll never be happy
in my life.

235
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,195
Why are you smiling?

236
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:12,329
- Because this is exactly

237
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:13,464
What we've trained for.

238
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:15,132
It's a hostage situation,

239
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:16,667
And we're gonna
bring your boys home.

240
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:22,739
And you think you're never
gonna be a father,

241
00:07:22,739 --> 00:07:24,075
But don't worry;
there's no way

242
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:26,143
I'm gonna let eleanor do
anything to your precious...

243
00:07:26,143 --> 00:07:27,611
- Boyle oil?
- Ugh, all right, i'm out.

244
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:28,779
She can do what she wants.

245
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:29,780
- No, no, no, no, no.

246
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,982
We'll just call them hostages.

247
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:33,317
- All right, fine,
let's get to work.

248
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:35,086
Here's what we know
about eleanor.

249
00:07:35,086 --> 00:07:36,320
- Oh, my wedding day.

250
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,654
I should've known
it was a mistake

251
00:07:37,654 --> 00:07:39,323
When she said, "i suppose,"
instead of, "i do."

252
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:40,424
- Yowch, all right.

253
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:42,326
Hostage taker:
eleanor horstweil.

254
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:44,528
Age: 42.
Occupation: bank manager.

255
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:46,030
No priors.
Clean bill of health.

256
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,132
Current husband:
hercules thikalonos.

257
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,201
- Don't bring him into it.
We're actually quite close.

258
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:52,003
- Noted.
You divorced in 2010.

259
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:53,637
She got the house, both cars,

260
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:55,706
And 85% of your salary
going forward.

261
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:57,008
That's a typo, right?

262
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,010
- It is not.
- How did she get so much?

263
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,911
- My lawyer was hercules.
That's how they met.

264
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:02,346
- That seems real unethical.

265
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:04,715
- Again, lay off hercules.
He's quite a decent man.

266
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:06,883
- All right, look, we need
some sort of bargaining chip.

267
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,086
Is there anything you got
in the divorce that she wanted?

268
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:10,721
- Yes—abigail.

269
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:11,788
- I'm gonna just assume

270
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:13,224
Abigail's something
super weird.

271
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:14,758
- Nope.
She was our hairdresser.

272
00:08:14,758 --> 00:08:15,759
- Ah, okay.

273
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,860
- It was awkward for her

274
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,295
To see both of us,
so she made us choose.

275
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,696
I mean, i couldn't
get rid of her.

276
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:22,099
She's the only stylist
in new york that can do this.

277
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,202
- Right, and do you think
eleanor still wants abigail?

278
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:27,038
- I mean, you saw
her hair today.

279
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:29,606
[chuckles]
it's all volume, no sheen.

280
00:08:29,606 --> 00:08:30,607
[both laughing]

281
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:31,808
- Okay,
maybe we can use this.

282
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:33,710
Time to put on
our negotiation faces.

283
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,213
Not too intimidating
but always in control.

284
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:37,581
How's this?

285
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,718
- Oh, as if you don't know
it's perfect.

286
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:43,554
- Hey, sergeant.

287
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:44,588
How are you?

288
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:45,756
- Well, my baby cries

289
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:48,159
At the sight of my face now,
so that's great.

290
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,061
- I mean, she's a baby;

291
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,895
She could be crying
at anything.

292
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,564
- Nope, she pointed
right at my nose

293
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:54,665
And then threw up.

294
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:56,600
What do you want, santiago?

295
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,269
- I was just wondering
if you finished

296
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:00,237
Writing that
recommendation letter.

297
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:01,738
It's due pretty soon.

298
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:02,806
- I'm working on it.

299
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:03,907
It's taking a little while

300
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:05,309
Because it's hard
to concentrate,

301
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:06,477
What with all the agony.

302
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:09,646
- Okay, well, thank you
for still doing it.

303
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:12,716
If it helps, i brought you
some soothing ginger tea.

304
00:09:12,716 --> 00:09:15,686
- Will it repair the place
where my nose came off my skull?

305
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:16,820
- I don't know,

306
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,090
But it's supposed to have
healing vapors.

307
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,857
So try inhaling it?

308
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:23,427
- Oh, thank you.

309
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,098
[screaming]
it burns!

310
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:28,432
- Oh!
- The vapors burn!

311
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:30,267
- I'm sorry! I'll take it back!
- [screaming]

312
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:32,936
- Oh, god, i'm sorry!
I'll get some cold water!

313
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:35,005
- No, no, don't.

314
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:37,508
I am petrified of you!

315
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:38,942
- All right, remember,

316
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:40,511
This is a negotiation.

317
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,413
We can't let her know
how badly you want this.

318
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:43,780
- Jake, what if
she destroys the sperm?

319
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,416
- She's not gonna
do that, charles,

320
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,118
Because then
she'd have no leverage.

321
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:50,020
All right, you know this;
they never shoot the hostage.

322
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,455
- Hey!

323
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:53,724
Did you threaten that
90-Year-Old man for me yet?

324
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:55,759
- What?
The guy you hit was 90?

325
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,928
- Yeah, and you would know that
if you had talked to him,

326
00:09:57,928 --> 00:09:59,763
Which obviously you did not,
so good-Bye!

327
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:01,232
- No, no, wait, wait, look.

328
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:02,899
We can't help you out
until we know that

329
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,068
You actually have
the samples.

330
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:06,603
We need proof of life.

331
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:07,771
- I'd be happy to dump

332
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:09,406
One of the containers
out of the window.

333
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:10,774
- No, no, no, don't do that,
please!

334
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:12,276
Don't dumb my sperm on us!

335
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:14,745
- Hello, ma'am.
Top of the morning to you.

336
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:17,114
All right, look,
if you let us upstairs...

337
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,716
We'll give you abigail.

338
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:23,287
- I'll buzz you in.

339
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:25,389
- And that is how
it's done.

340
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,391
Like taking candy
from a baby.

341
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,160
- Why would you bring up
babies right now?

342
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,995
- It's a saying.
- Who would do that?

343
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:33,497
- The question is,
why would someone

344
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:34,665
Want to talk to gina?

345
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:35,766
- That's very rude.

346
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:36,967
- It's obvious
why the guy wants to talk

347
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,502
To a civilian like her;
he's stalling.

348
00:10:38,502 --> 00:10:39,736
- That's also rude.

349
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:41,305
Maybe he wants to talk
to a normal person

350
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:43,240
Instead of two rude cops.

351
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,309
- Well, whatever his reason,
we have no other choice.

352
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:46,643
Gina take his statement.

353
00:10:46,643 --> 00:10:48,078
- Yes, thank you!

354
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:49,280
I'm gonna get this guy
to admit

355
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,847
To crimes he hasn't
even committed.

356
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,016
- No, that would be
a huge problem.

357
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,318
- Copy that.

358
00:10:54,318 --> 00:10:55,786
- We'll get you a file on him
so you can study up.

359
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,788
- That won't be necessary.
I'm gonna go with my gut.

360
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,290
He asked for gina.

361
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,725
Let's give the people
what they want.

362
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,098
Steven, steven, steven...

363
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:09,533
You mind if i take a seat?

364
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:11,235
- Go for it.

365
00:11:12,369 --> 00:11:13,370
- Oh, boy.

366
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,871
- Look, i'm not a cop.

367
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,673
I don't really like cops.

368
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:19,776
Honestly, i think
crime's kind of cool.

369
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:22,078
- Okay.
- Yeah, you get it.

370
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:23,914
- Are we still holding out hope
that this might work?

371
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,682
- I am.
Let's give her a shot.

372
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:28,118
- I feel like you and me
are really bonding.

373
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,586
I'm ready to give you
immunity.

374
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,222
- No, you're not.
That's not happening!

375
00:11:31,222 --> 00:11:32,356
Gina, come out of there.

376
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:33,457
- Negative.

377
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:34,625
The guy wanted to talk

378
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,092
To a real person,
not a cop.

379
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:37,594
That's why he asked for me.

380
00:11:37,594 --> 00:11:39,263
- Actually,
i asked for you

381
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,265
Because we went
to high school together.

382
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,966
- What?
- Steven henderson.

383
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,968
We had a bunch
of classes together.

384
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:47,804
Steven henderson—
we made out once on the bus.

385
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:50,374
I mean—
do you not remember me?

386
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:53,277
- Uh...

387
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,247
- Eleanor.

388
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:57,248
- Jake.

389
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:58,482
- Charles.

390
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,883
- Okay, you just
said your own name, bud.

391
00:11:59,883 --> 00:12:01,285
- It was the only one left.

392
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:04,455
- Okay, so we have
given you abigail.

393
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:05,622
Now it's time for you

394
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:07,324
To make good
on your side of the deal,

395
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:09,326
And—i can't believe
i'm saying this—

396
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,395
Show us charles' sperm.

397
00:12:11,395 --> 00:12:12,996
- It's my sperm.

398
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:14,164
It's in the freezer.

399
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:16,032
I'll be right back.

400
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:17,634
- Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

401
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:19,336
Abigail was our
only bargaining chip.

402
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:20,571
- Don't worry.
I have a plan.

403
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:21,905
As soon as she
comes back in here,

404
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,274
I'm gonna grab that cup
right out of her hands

405
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:24,275
And run like hell.

406
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,276
- You think that'll work?

407
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:26,510
- I don't just think it will.

408
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,345
I know it might.

409
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:31,582
- Here it is—cold and sad.
Just like you.

410
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,417
- How do i know that
that's really charles'?

411
00:12:33,417 --> 00:12:35,919
I'm gonna have to read
the label up close.

412
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,754
If i could just take
a look—[laughs]

413
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,291
Go, boyle!
- [shouts]

414
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,092
- You really think
i'm that stupid?

415
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:46,730
It's called a dummy cup,
dummies.

416
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,565
- Damn it.
She's right; it's empty.

417
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:50,200
- Oh...
- I'm actually kind of relieved.

418
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,502
I did not want to see that.

419
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:53,404
- You two are messing with
the wrong woman.

420
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:55,606
And now
you're gonna pay for it.

421
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,040
- Wait, wait!
- Eleanor, eleanor!

422
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,376
- There are
two real containers.

423
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:01,312
One is in a safe location,

424
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:03,780
And this is the other one.

425
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,618
Or rather,
it was the other one.

426
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:08,619
[clattering]

427
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:09,620
- No!

428
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,988
[garbage disposal churning]

429
00:13:11,988 --> 00:13:13,690
- She shot a hostage.

430
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:20,331
- I'm sorry, but i don't
have a choice, jake.

431
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:21,632
I'm gonna go bully
an old priest

432
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:23,367
So i can get my sperms back.

433
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,535
- He's a priest?

434
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:25,869
- Yeah, i looked him up.

435
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:28,672
He's a priest,
a 90-Year-Old priest.

436
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:30,541
But don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt him.

437
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,476
I'm just gonna casually yawn...

438
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,380
Thereby exposing
my gun and badge.

439
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,782
- Listen, you can't do this,
charles; it's illegal.

440
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:39,783
- I have to.

441
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:40,784
You saw what eleanor did

442
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:41,885
To millions of my babies.

443
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:43,186
I heard them scream!

444
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:44,220
- That was you.

445
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,357
- I am them,
and they are me.

446
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,725
- You could go to prison,
okay?

447
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,562
- You're right.
You're right.

448
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,029
What am i thinking?

449
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,198
Thank you
for looking out for me...

450
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:56,867
- Yeah.
- Friend.

451
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:59,069
- No!
What—

452
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:00,371
Oh, charles,
what are you doing?

453
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:02,806
No, no, no, no, no!
Not the keys, no!

454
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:04,441
Oh, i should've known.

455
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:06,276
You're a hugger,
not a shaker.

456
00:14:06,276 --> 00:14:08,078
- It was the most painful thing
i've ever done,

457
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,647
And i've taken three of my
grandparents off life support.

458
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,383
- How are you
always in charge of that?

459
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,585
Wait, charles,
do not get in that car!

460
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:15,952
He's getting in the car.
- Sorry.

461
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:17,220
- Don't you drive away!

462
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,422
He's driving away.

463
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,824
[tires screeching]
charles!

464
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:22,058
[computer beeps]

465
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:24,260
- [gasps] i just got
an email from sam-Sam.

466
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,262
Rejected?

467
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:28,131
I've never been rejected
from anything.

468
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:29,165
- Me neither.

469
00:14:29,165 --> 00:14:31,502
Oops, did you say
rejected or ejected?

470
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,969
I've been rejected a lot.

471
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:34,270
- I don't understand.

472
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,272
My application was so good.

473
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:38,775
- You know what?
I've also been ejected.

474
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,911
Flume ride, topeka, kansas.

475
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:42,012
- How did this happen?

476
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:44,080
- Just forgot
to put on the belt.

477
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,248
- Jeffords.

478
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,650
- Good talk, ames.

479
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:52,088
- You wrote me
a bad recommendation.

480
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:53,289
How could you?

481
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,659
- Excuse me?
- It's the only explanation!

482
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,160
You're mad that
i broke your face

483
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,662
And i burned
your whole body.

484
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,731
Well, grow up!

485
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:02,999
- Grow up?

486
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,235
I have a roth ira!

487
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:07,438
I eat wheat toast!
You grow up!

488
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:08,872
You know what?

489
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:11,708
Here's the letter
that i sent.

490
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,210
- "amy santiago is one
of the finest detectives

491
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,914
In my precinct—
nay, the entire nypd."

492
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:20,283
- Yeah, i even
used the word "nay."

493
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:26,289
The idea that you would
question my integrity is so—

494
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:29,793
Uh-Oh, i got to sneeze.
This is gonna hurt!

495
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:31,462
- Oh, oh, god.

496
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,530
- [sneezing]

497
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,798
[screaming]

498
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:36,366
- Oh, hitchcock, thank god!

499
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,034
- Handcuffed yourself
to a car?

500
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:39,069
Been there.

501
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:40,804
- What?
No, charles did this.

502
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:43,540
Here, quick,
hand me those keys.

503
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,875
Here we go.

504
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,209
- What will you
give me for them?

505
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,211
- Seriously?
What do you want?

506
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,213
- A dollar for a soda;
mine are all wet.

507
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:51,882
- Yes, obviously,
i'll give you that!

508
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:52,883
- Bam!

509
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:55,719
A soda only costs 75¢,
you fool.

510
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,821
See you later, sucker!

511
00:15:57,821 --> 00:15:59,556
- Didn't even give him
the dollar.

512
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:02,225
- I know it seems
like i blew it,

513
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:04,327
But you got to give me
another crack at him.

514
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,897
Now that i'm aware
of our fascinating past,

515
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,398
I have all the ammo
that i need.

516
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:09,866
- Perhaps you would've
had that ammo

517
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:11,568
If you had read the file
diaz offered you.

518
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:14,170
- No doubt. No doubt.
Gina culpa.

519
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,573
- Okay, you get
one more chance.

520
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:18,875
- I will not let you down.

521
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:23,680
Steven, steven, steven,
i have one question.

522
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,415
Who on the basketball team
was into me?

523
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:26,750
I want names.

524
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,018
- What?

525
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:29,686
- We don't have time
to play games, steven.

526
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:30,854
- That's it.
I'm pulling her.

527
