1
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:05,990
It's Halloween—I'm surprised
you didn't put on a costume.

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:07,925
- I was going to, sir,
but then I decided,

3
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:09,493
"screw that jazz."

4
00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:11,728
Well, I'm the only one
who ever dresses up,

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,364
no one ever gets
my costume,

6
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:15,266
and they make fun of me—
so I'm done.

7
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:17,935
These people don't deserve
my dress-up gifts.

8
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,036
[elevator dings]

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,372
- Charles, seriously?

10
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,373
No costume?

11
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,440
- What the hell, Charles?

12
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:24,775
Where's your
Halloween spirit?

13
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:27,111
- But you guys always
make fun of me.

14
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:30,747
- I have never once
insulted you in my life,

15
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,050
especially vis-à-vis
your appearance.

16
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:34,852
- Yeah, man, we always
love your costumes.

17
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:37,021
- Remember last year,
when you came as that

18
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:39,456
person and/or thing?

19
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:40,791
- Yes, I do remember!

20
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:43,928
Sir, permission to sprint
to my car and get

21
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,029
my emergency costume?

22
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:46,263
- Does it matter
if I say no?

23
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:47,932
- No!

24
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:55,206
A-bam, bam, boom.

25
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,075
What the—what—

26
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,911
- Why are you dressed up?
You look like an idiot.

27
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:00,978
- But—but—

28
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:02,346
- Yeah, what are you
supposed to be,

29
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:03,915
a sassy car mechanic?

30
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:07,184
- No, come on—he's clearly
the rejected Pop-Tarts mascot,

31
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:08,352
Harry Pop-Tart.

32
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:10,187
- I am not!
You know who I am!

33
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:12,023
- Squad, that's enough—
you're making Boyle

34
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:13,024
feel bad on purpose.

35
00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:14,325
He's Elvis.
- Yes!

36
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,060
- Elvis Stojko,
the Canadian figure skater.

37
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:17,194
- No!

38
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,483
- Attention, squad:
today is the most

39
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,518
important day in the
history of this precinct.

40
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:45,389
For today is Halloween—

41
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:47,058
I thought we were going to
say it together.

42
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:48,525
- I never agreed to that.
- All right.

43
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:50,094
- As you may know,
for the past two years,

44
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:53,197
Captain Holt and I have engaged
in an epic battle of wits.

45
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,832
The goal: to determine
who must call the other

46
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,868
an amazing
detective/genius.

47
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:00,604
- The first year,
by sheer, dumb luck,

48
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,439
Jake eked out a feeble victory.

49
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:04,008
- And last year, I let
the captain win,

50
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:05,676
because he's old and sad.

51
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:07,611
- Sad because the competition
was so dismal.

52
00:02:07,644 --> 00:02:08,980
- Is this meeting
about something?

53
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,347
- It's about everything.

54
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:11,582
- This year's the tie-breaker,

55
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,450
a final heist to decide
once and for all

56
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:15,586
the true king of the nine-nine.

57
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,355
- Halloween Heist III:
The Heistening. Tagline?

58
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,324
- This year we both attempt
to steal the same object

59
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,259
instead of Jake attempting
to steal one from me.

60
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:24,861
- I gave you one direction
on the tagline—snappy.

61
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:27,764
But yes, we will be attempting
to steal the same item—

62
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:29,200
this.

63
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:31,002
- The crown will be locked
in this briefcase,

64
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:33,804
which in turn will be locked
in the interrogation room.

65
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:38,442
♪ And so unto the briefcase
goes the crown ♪

66
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,044
Didn't sing it with me.

67
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,212
We will need help,

68
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:42,646
so to be fair,
we're holding a draft.

69
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,448
The captain and I have
given up our overtime,

70
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:47,018
so everyone who participates
will get the night off—captain?

71
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:49,053
- With the first pick
of the draft, I choose...

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,621
Terry.

73
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:53,290
- Okay, brawns over brains.

74
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:54,625
- All right, I take Charles.

75
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,127
- I get it. Close friend.

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,328
- I pick Gina.
- Gina?

77
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,629
- I take Rosa.

78
00:02:58,662 --> 00:02:59,630
- What?

79
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:02,133
Okay, all right.
Well, Captain—

80
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,867
that leaves me with you.

81
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,602
Let's do this.
- Hang on, Santiago.

82
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,071
I'm not sure I can
trust you.

83
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:11,542
You're Peralta's paramour;
maybe you should be on his team.

84
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:13,310
- No, no, no—
Amy would do anything

85
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:15,746
to win your approval,
including pretending

86
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,781
to be in a relationship with me
for the past few weeks

87
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,583
only to betray me now.

88
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,485
- Jake, you are majorly
overthinking this.

89
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:24,055
- Maybe, but it's a risk
I'm not willing to take.

90
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:27,324
You're not on my team, Amy.
- Yeah, Amy's out.

91
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,660
By midnight,
whoever has the crown

92
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:32,829
will be the king
of the nine-nine.

93
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,066
- Uh, Hitchcock and I
still haven't been chosen.

94
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,567
- I'm good.
- Me too.

95
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:43,107
- So, I see you've been assigned
to guard the briefcase too.

96
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,278
- Yup, I'm not supposed to let
it or you out of my sight,

97
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,146
if that even is you.

98
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,648
- Ow, that's my face!

99
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:54,151
- Oh, sorry—I thought it was a
cheap, rubber mask.

100
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:56,487
- Well, I have exciting news.

101
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,655
I found the perfect guy
to set you up with.

102
00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:03,160
- After zero consideration,
I'm happy to say, "hard pass."

103
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:05,329
- Come on, our parents
are married.

104
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:06,763
Genevieve and I are dating.

105
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,599
I want you to have
someone too.

106
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,401
- [sighs]
- You shouldn't have to

107
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,002
slow-dance alone
after family dinner.

108
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:13,904
- How did my life come to this?

109
00:04:13,937 --> 00:04:16,240
Charles, it's very sweet
that you want to

110
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:17,908
set me up with someone,

111
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:20,611
but I do not trust your taste
in guys at all.

112
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,579
- I have spectacular taste
in men.

113
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:24,248
You would love Nadia.

114
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,449
- His name is Nadia?

115
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,119
- Oh, all of a sudden
Nadia's not a cool name?

116
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,554
You are impossible.

117
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:33,124
- Here, got it?
- Got it.

118
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:39,130
- Hey, Jake.
Can we talk?

119
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,631
- Yeah.

120
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,766
- You really hurt my feelings
by leaving me off your team.

121
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,369
- Oh, I had no idea
you felt that way.

122
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:47,971
- Well, it doesn't feel great
to be left out.

123
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,241
- Right, totally, I get it.
I'm sorry...

124
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:51,408
Captain Holt!

125
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,577
- What? Why are you yelling
at my boobs?

126
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,212
- Because that's where
the camera is.

127
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:56,747
Nice try, Ray-Ray!

128
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,149
- There's no camera, Jake.

129
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,383
I was being serious.

130
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,286
- Okay fine—if you're
telling the truth,

131
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,720
then I sincerely
apologize.

132
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:07,558
But since you're not,
I will defeat you!

133
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:13,063
[witch cackling]
Ahhh! Gah! Scary witch!

134
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:14,064
Scary, so scary!

135
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:15,299
- Amy, don't feel bad.

136
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:17,201
You can get in on
my bet with Scully.

137
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,869
At midnight tonight,
we will steal

138
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,637
his foot fungus cream.

139
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,073
- Thanks, that's very kind
of you to include me,

140
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:24,308
but I'll have to pass.

141
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,742
- The mind games have
already begun.

142
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,179
- No, I'm not part of this.
- Oh, of course not.

143
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,514
Neither am I.
Wink.

144
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:31,682
- Ugh.

145
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,185
- I'm not going to meet
my next boyfriend

146
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,519
through a Charles set-up.

147
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,355
I'm going to meet him in an
illegal dance competition

148
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,391
in an abandoned
subway tunnel.

149
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,059
- It's go time, Boyle.

150
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,329
Holt and Terry have closed
the blinds—release the roaches.

151
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:48,332
- Alternately, he could win
an illegal street race

152
00:05:48,365 --> 00:05:50,367
in which my love is the prize.

153
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:52,536
- Oh, my God! Gina, look!
Roaches!

154
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,070
- [screams]
- Look!

155
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,541
- Ew, Charles, kill them with
whatever cologne you're wearing!

156
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,109
- No, I can't!
They're moving too fast!

157
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,612
I can't kill them!
It's pandemonium!

158
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:04,581
- If I die, turn my Tweets
into a book!

159
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,451
- Commence operation,
"Oh crap, wrong vent."

160
00:06:07,484 --> 00:06:11,087
- [gasp]
- Oh crap, wrong vent.

161
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,356
This was a mistake.

162
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:14,358
- Nice try, losers.
You blew it.

163
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,659
- Yeah, we totally blew it.

164
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,761
And all because Boyle
marked the wrong vent.

165
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,232
- It's not my fault—I thought
it was the right vent.

166
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,767
- Unbelievable, mister.
- You are, mister.

167
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,437
- I'm having trouble even
believing you at all right now.

168
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,939
That is the last time
I let Charles mark a vent.

169
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,674
- I'm normally great
at marking vents.

170
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,243
- Lock picked.

171
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:35,946
- Never, ever, never, ever,
ever, never, ever, ever,

172
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,450
never, ever, will I ever,
never, ever, ever, ever,

173
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,985
ever, never, never, never—
I forgive you, and good-bye.

174
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,258
- Wow, you should have
seen us, Rosa.

175
00:06:47,258 --> 00:06:48,525
Charles and I
were amazing.

176
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,160
- I somersaulted
through a window,

177
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:51,695
cut the crown out of
a briefcase,

178
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:53,897
and replaced everything
in under a minute.

179
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:55,366
- Yeah, I guess you
helped a little.

180
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,335
But our fake argument
was super convincing.

181
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,271
And all of a sudden,
we had to make it longer,

182
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:02,138
and we did.

183
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:04,541
Anyways, now all we gotta do
is guard this drawer

184
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,743
until midnight,
and the best part about it is

185
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:10,146
Captain Holt has
absolutely no idea.

186
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,783
He is such a fool.

187
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:15,752
- Yes, I'm the fool.

188
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:17,754
You fool.

189
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:19,290
- So we wanted Jake
to take the crown?

190
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,625
- Sergeant, are you familiar
with the Hungarian fencing term,

191
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:23,294
Hosszú Gorcs?

192
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:24,628
- You must realize
my answer is no.

193
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,297
- It's a strategy of
letting your opponent

194
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,300
win points early to give them
a sense of overconfidence,

195
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,136
thus exposing a much easier
target for you later.

196
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:34,771
- You think he's
overconfident enough?

197
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:38,842
- I'm the smartest man alive.

198
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,411
I'm never gonna die.

199
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:46,617
- Of course.

200
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,319
Jeffords,
we'll rendezvous later.

201
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:57,093
- Sir, I want to
talk about Jake.

202
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:59,330
Okay—
- Amy! Help!

203
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,598
Our foot fungus heist
has gone sideways!

- Hitchcock, not now.

205

- Scully doesn't know
I'm in here.

206
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,337
I stole his foot cream,
but then I lost it.

207
00:08:06,337 --> 00:08:08,872
Amy, you're the only hope
I have of finding it.

208
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,206
You're a detective.

209
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,876
- You're a detective!
Get out of here!

210
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,179
Go! [sighs]

211
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,014
Sir, Jake really pissed me off,

212
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:19,883
and I want to help you
take him down.

213
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,918
- Well, that's an
intriguing proposition.

214
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,854
You certainly
could be useful...

215
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:25,221
- Thank you.

216
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,923
- To Jake!

217
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:30,627
I got you, Peralta!
You're not fooling anyone!

218
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:33,196
- Why does everyone think
that's where a camera would be?

219
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,967
- Because the cleavage cloaks
the camera with its curves.

220
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,470
That will be all, spy.

221
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:43,407
Sorry I said cleavage.
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,077
- Charles, that is so nasty you
put cockroaches in your pants.

223
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,612
- When you say it
like that, yeah.

224
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:49,813
But Jake made it sound so cool.

225
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,914
- How?
[knocks on door]

expecting anyone.

Gina, this was the boy
I was telling you about.

- You're Nadia?

231
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,397
- Well, my real name's Leo;
Nadia's just my tag.

232
00:09:06,397 --> 00:09:08,732
I don't love it, but when Banksy
gives you a nickname,

it just sticks.

234
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,535
- Okay, I see what's
going on here.

235
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,870
This isn't a setup—
this is a setup.

236
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:17,741
And all of this is supposed to
distract me from the heist.

237
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:20,243
- The heist?
- [mocking tone] The heist?

238

This is an obvious trap, okay?

Well, guess what, sweetie?

This is one trick you ain't
gonna be turning tonight.

I'm not saying these are
from your motorcycle,

but I found these
stripped handlebars outside.

with my bike for this heist.

Let me remind you
I'm carrying a weapon.

00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,482
- You know it's "for whom."

348
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:53,684
Don't try to provoke me.

349
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:56,052
- I didn't know that.

350
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,688
both: I'm going to get
that crown back.

351
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:58,722
- Wait—what?
- Huh?

352
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,224
Will you excuse me
for just one moment?

353
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,459
- Yes, I too
need to be excused.

354
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,128
- [whispering]
He doesn't have the crown!

355
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:06,329
- What? Who has it, then?

356
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:07,898
- I don't know who has it.
- What do we do?

357
00:14:07,964 --> 00:14:09,833
- Pull the security tape.
I'll distract them.

358
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,902
Hey, look at this.

359
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:16,206
Ahhhhhhhhhh.

360
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,808
Damn it, how did that
not work?

361
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:21,511
- Hmm, Captain Holt said
you guys stole the crown

362
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:22,913
when Jake came through
the ceiling.

363
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:24,547
- Yeah, I can't believe
you fell for that.

364
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,082
You really think I'd mark
the wrong vent?

365
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:28,151
I've never marked
a wrong vent in my life.

366
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:29,720
- You're very intense
about vents.

367
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:30,887
- Yeah.

368
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:32,723
- Wait—so Nadia wasn't
just a distraction?

369
00:14:32,723 --> 00:14:34,858
- No, 100% real.

370
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:38,028
Handsome, cool, hair as thick
as a collie's.

371
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:40,263
I found you the perfect guy,
and you drove him off.

372
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,932
- Ugh. I'm sorry.

373
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,767
I should have trusted you.

374
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:45,869
Please call him
and tell him I messed up.

375
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,004
- Fine, but only if you
agree that your first date

376
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:50,040
will be a double date
with me and Genevieve

377
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:51,407
on a week-long trip
to Turk's—

378
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,109
- Forget it, no.
Forget it.

379
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:54,244
- No! Okay, I'll call him.

380
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:55,846
Please, I want this
so badly.

381
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:58,782
- Fine, you may
call him for me.

382
00:14:58,849 --> 00:15:01,151
- Thank you.

383
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:03,653
- Okay, here I am taking
pictures with Terry's kids.

384
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:05,922
Man, I look so strong
standing next to them.

385
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:06,990
Should I have kids?
- Sure.

386
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,124
Okay.

387
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,593
It's Holt.
Whoa, how did he do that?

388
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:12,128
- Guy has an insane
set of abs.

389
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,297
Oh, look,
he's got the crown.

390
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,631
And he's headed to
the break room.

391
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,967
- He dumped it in the trash.

392
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,101
Did he go back and get it?

393
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:21,671
- Nope, janitor came in
and took it.

394
00:15:21,772 --> 00:15:22,773
But which janitor?

395
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:24,340
Looks like I'm going to
have to squint.

396
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,480
His name is Al—
Al the janitor.

397
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,783
All right, it's 11:00 P.M. now;
That means Al's long gone.

398
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:34,317
How are we going to
get his home address?

399
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,186
- Who's the one person you know
who's anal enough

400
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:39,155
to send out holiday cards
to every single employee?

401
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:43,226
- Amy!
- What do you want, Jake?

402
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,829
- What? Why would you assume
that I want anything?

403
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,398
What I want is to apologize
to my girlfriend,

404
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:49,565
who I hurt.

405
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:50,666
- It's "whom."

406
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,035
- Why does the word "who"
even exist

407
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:53,303
if you're not allowed
to say it?

408
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:54,905
Anyways, now that
I've apologized

409
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:58,809
and you've accepted, can you
give me janitor Al's address?

410
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:01,044
- This is related
to your heist, isn't it?

411
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:03,880
- No, no.
It's about a crime.

412
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:06,716
I think janitor Al is
going to kill the president.

413
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:09,085
- Oh, Santiago.
There's my protégé.

414
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,154
- Let me guess—
you want the janitor's address.

415
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,224
- Janitor? Address? Al?

416
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:15,992
- I never said his name.

417
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,561
Well, isn't this rich.

418
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,897
After being excluded
by both of you,

419
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,232
here I am with the power
to decide

420
00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:25,068
who wins and who loses
your little heist.

421
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,669
- I wouldn't have it
any other way.

422
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,638
You are my wisest detective.

423
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,908
- Pathetic.
She can't be manipulated, sir.

424
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,643
Amy, we are in love.

425
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:34,978
I know we've never
said it before,

426
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:36,847
but I think this is
the perfect time, don't you?

427
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:38,314
- Love? Ha.

428
00:16:38,348 --> 00:16:41,484
What's love compared to the
respect of a workplace superior?

429
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,586
- Amy Santiago,
will you m—

430
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,188
- Enough!
- Okay.

431
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,257
- Pretending to be nice to me
is worse than being mean.

432
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,193
You know what?
You want the address?

433
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,464
Here, you can both have it.

434
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:56,299
[cell phones ringing]

435
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,534
Hope you're happy,
you selfish monsters.

436
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,771
- I feel terrible.
- We should apologize.

437
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:03,073
- Yes, I agree.

438
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,341
You definitely should now;
I'll do mine later.

439
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,776
- Fat chance.

440
00:17:06,877 --> 00:17:08,678
- Charles, I need your butt.
Meet me downstairs.

441
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:10,280
- Alpha Team, this is
the Golden Sparrow.

442
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:11,915
Rendezvous at
Drop Zone Yankee.

443
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,884
- When did you come up
with those code names?

444
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,753
Okay, he lives on
the sixteenth floor.

445
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:18,889
- I think we beat Holt here.

446
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,224
- Or did you?
- I'll get the elevator.

447
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,726
- Crap! Looks like
we're taking the stairs.

448
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,598
All right, it's sixteen floors—
pace yourselves.

449
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,366
Forget it.
Run as fast as you can!

450
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,706
[panting]

451
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,943
[knocks]
Ha ha!

452
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,378
I win. I knocked first.

453
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:44,814
You're not Al.

454
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:46,149
- You're looking for Al?

455
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:48,384
- Of course we're looking
for Al, you imbecile!

456
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:50,753
Sorry.

457
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:52,588
- He's having a cigarette
on the roof.

458
00:17:52,622 --> 00:17:53,957
- The roof?

459
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,262
[panting]

460
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,564
Yes.
I did it.

461
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,833
I am the greatest
athlete in the world.

462
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:05,668
[vomits]

463
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,503
- Al? Al?

464
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:09,839
Where's Al?

465
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,741
- Oh, there he is.
There he is!

466
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,809
I did it. I did it.

467
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,345
[vomits]

468
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:17,047
- Good God.

469
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,082
Are you Al the janitor?

470
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:22,418
- Nope.
I'm your worst nightmare.

471
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:24,554
Amy Santiago.

472
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:27,223
- Oh, no.

473
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,366
- Allow me to explain.

474
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,702
Amy and I were ahead of you
the whole time.

475
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:41,972
- No, you weren't
part of this.

476
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:44,074
Get back over to
the loser side, loser.

477
00:18:44,107 --> 00:18:45,108
- All right.
Worth a shot.

478
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:46,376
- So how'd you pull it off?

479
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:48,544
- Well, it all started
when I went to tell Jake

480
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:50,613
how badly he hurt
my feelings,

481
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,448
and he yelled at
my breasts.

482
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:54,884
- Oh, boy, I am not going to
come off well in this story.

483
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:55,986
- Nope.

484
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:57,387
Remember when you
set off the witch?

485
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,754
[witch cackling]

486
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:00,590
You made Captain Holt
flinch, which was weird,

487
00:19:00,623 --> 00:19:02,125
since his door was closed,

488
00:19:02,158 --> 00:19:04,360
but not weird, since he
actually heard it over a bug

489
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:05,861
he planted at your desk.

490
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:07,998
It was in an old muffin that you
never threw in the trash.

491
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:10,033
- That's why people
throw away garbage.

492
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,034
- How are we together?

493
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,302
- Eh.

494
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,370
- Anyway, I tapped into
the bug's frequencies,

495
00:19:14,437 --> 00:19:16,172
so I had ears on Jake.

496
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:17,640
I needed to know
what Holt was up to.

497
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,642
That's where Hitchcock
came in.

498
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,611
- I masterminded
the entire plan.

499
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:24,047
- You did one small thing,
and I had to explain it to you,

500
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,448
like, 45 times.

501
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:27,217
He left a tiny crack
in the blind,

502
00:19:27,283 --> 00:19:28,651
so I could read
the Captain's lips.

503
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:31,021
"Sharon and your kids
will distract Jake.

504
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:32,688
"They'll be here at 9:30 sharp.

505
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:35,458
My waffle xylophone
on the cheese man."

506
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:36,459
- What?

507
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:37,793
- My lip-reading
is not flawless.

508
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,129
Now that I knew your plan,

509
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:40,363
it was simple to disrupt.

510
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:42,298
While Scully gracefully
moved the witch,

511
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:43,799
I got into character.

512
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,867
Holt triggered the witch,

513
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,202
which brought Jake
into the room.

514
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:48,138
- And I threw the crown
in the trash can.

515
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,040
- Exactly as I planned.

516
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,243
Then I sent you all here,
placed an out-of-order sign

517
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,179
on the perfectly
functional elevator,

518
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,913
made you all walk up
31 flights of stairs

519
00:19:58,048 --> 00:19:59,382
and vomit twice.

520
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,550
- Actually, it was four times,

521
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,852
if you count all
the stairwell stuff.

522
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:04,687
- You thought I was
just Holt's lackey.

523
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,090
And you thought I was
just Jake's girlfriend.

524
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:09,025
Well, I'm my own person,

525
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,194
capable of making
my own decisions,

526
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:13,363
and I decided to
humiliate you both.

527
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:17,567
- Well, you did,
and it was awesome.

528
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,703
One last question:
where's the crown?

529
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,338
- Oh, it's at Shaw's Bar,

530
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:25,075
the official site
of my coronation.

531
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:27,277
- All hail the crown of destiny.

532
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:30,346
[cheers]

533
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,218
And all hail she who wears it,
Amy Santiago, the...

534
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:36,852
- Queen.

535
00:20:36,886 --> 00:20:38,688
- Queen of the nine-nine.

536
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,090
[cheers]

537
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,524
- I believe there's
something else

538
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:42,692
you both need to say.

539
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:43,693
- Gladly.

540
00:20:43,726 --> 00:20:44,794
both:
Amy Santiago

541
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,030
is an amazing
detective/genius.

542
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,365
Drinks are on us.

543
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:51,367
- Nope.
- Drinks are on me.

544
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,902
- Yeah!

545
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:57,573
- Hey.

546
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,209
- I'm glad you showed up.

547
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:01,477
Sorry I was acting
so weird earlier.

548
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,514
- Hey, I don't blame you.
Sagittarius, right?

549
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:06,782
With Saturn where it is,
you're right to be wary

550
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:08,151
of new relationships.

551
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,987
- How is it possible
that a spirit such as yourself

552
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,356
even knows Charles?

553
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,325
- I did an art show
at Genevieve's gallery.

554
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,993
- Oh, right—so you're not
really friends,

555
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,863
you know his girlfriend
through the art world.

556
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:22,965
- Yeah, plus,
she's my twin sister.

557
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,200
- What?

558
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:26,202
- Hi, Leo.
A kiss for my bro.

559
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:27,837
And a kiss for my beau.

560
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,871
- No.

561
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:29,905
- A kiss for my beau.

562
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,707
And a kiss for my sis.

563
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:32,908
- No!
