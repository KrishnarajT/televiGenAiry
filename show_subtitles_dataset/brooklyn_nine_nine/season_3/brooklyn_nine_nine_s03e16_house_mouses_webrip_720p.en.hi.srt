- Hey, Gina!
We got an anonymous gift basket.

00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:05,700
- Yeah, it's full of treats.

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:06,934
It's got meats, cheeses,
candies,

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:08,203
all the food groups.

5
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:09,437
- The cheese is amazing.

6
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:11,839
It melts in my mouth
and in my hands.

7
00:00:11,873 --> 00:00:14,876
- Hmm, French chocolates,
French cheeses,

8
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:16,278
tiny French pickles.

9
00:00:16,344 --> 00:00:18,746
Did none of you detectives
think this might be a gift

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,250
for Captain Holt from
someone in France?

11
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:24,519
Like his husband,
par exemple?

12
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:27,189
- What? [laughs]
No way.

13
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:30,692
This is a nice present from
an unknown, appreciative citizen

14
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:31,893
that wanted us to munch.

15
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:34,028
- Hmm, what's this, then?

16
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:36,531
"Dear Captain Raymond Holt,
thinking of you.

17
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:40,067
Best, Dr. Kevin Cozner, Ph.D."

18

He even used their pet names.

19
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:44,806
- Oh, no, I ate the
chocolate-covered strawberry.

20
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:46,541
That's the most intimate
snack of them all.

21
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:48,210
- Holt's gonna be back from
his meeting in 30 minutes.

22
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:49,577
What do we do?
- Eat the note!

23
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:52,113
- No!
No.

24
00:00:52,146 --> 00:00:54,582
It's okay.
We can fix this.

25
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:57,952
Check it out, sir.

26
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:02,224
A lovely gift basket that Kevin
sent you all the way from Paris.

27
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,958
- Straight from Paris!

28
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:11,899
- Stapler, scissors.

29
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:15,637
Rubber bands.

30
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,142

I just received a call.

00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,336
A very important,
very high profile celebrity

36
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,871
was robbed in our precinct.

37
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,606
- What celebrity, sir?
Is it a Chris?

38
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:54,909
Hemsworth? Evans? Pratt? Pine?
Brown? Cross?

39

[gasps]
Is it a non-Chris?

40

and I can only disclose details

41
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:01,349
to the lead detective
on the case.

42

You know that
I'm your guy for this.

You can't give

The last movie she saw was a
documentary about spelling bees.

48
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:17,365
- Wrong; it was about
the font Helvetica,

49
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:19,367
and it played like
an action thriller.

50
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:21,303
- You already have
a case, Peralta.

51
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,870
I assigned it to you
this morning.

I assigned you.

to Hitchcock and Scully?

57
00:02:33,615 --> 00:02:35,650
I mean, they clearly have
a ton of time on their hands.

I'm... under 17 years old.

Or the year before.

Are you afraid of needles?

stabbed by someone

I'm tougher than Rosa.

Eh, I take it back.
I'm so sorry.

Look, it's okay.
We all have fears.

and for all of womenkind?

be good for—oh, wait.

You—we're doing my thing?
Okay.

- Thanks for taking us
to lunch, Jake.

- Of course.
Get whatever you want.

- Oh, man, I already ate.

00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,539
I guess I'll just have
a cheeseburger deluxe,

couple slices of pie,
maybe an egg cream.

112
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:41,609
- Okay.
- And a waffle.

113
00:04:41,643 --> 00:04:44,479
- So look, a big, important
drug case came across my desk,

114

Only problem is, Sarge doesn't
think you can handle it.

chased by other cops,

but he did slip
on my spilled chili.

122
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:02,730
- And who bumped into Scully,
causing the spill? Me.

123
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:05,800
- Damn right, and who fell
asleep under their desks

124
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,368
and caught the janitor
stealing evidence?

125
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:08,369
- We did.

126
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,837
- And who sued the department

127
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:12,707
and got triple-ply toilet paper
in every precinct?

128
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,708
- We did.

129
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:14,842
- Terry thinks you guys

130
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:15,977
are too old and too lazy
to handle this,

131
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,244
but I know what
you're really made of.

132
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:19,647
You're gonna take this case
and prove him wrong!

133
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:21,849
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

134
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:23,551
We're still gonna
eat lunch, right?

135
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:26,053
- Obviously, a high profile
celebrity case such as this one

136
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:29,223
needs to be handled
with the utmost discretion.

137
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,158
- I promise
I'll be professional,

138
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:32,860
even if it's Dianne Wiest.

139
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:36,097
Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm
gonna meet Dianne Wiest!

143

Weichselbraun.

144
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,878
- Remind me who that is again?

145
00:05:50,912 --> 00:05:53,080
- You're kidding.
He's a world-renowned oboist,

Symphony Orchestra.

147
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:59,020
Kevin and I are huge fans
of Weichselbraun's work.

148
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:02,990
We are what the Internet
sometimes refers to as...

149
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:04,926
Weichselbraun fans.

150
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,193
- Not Weichselbrauniacs?

151
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,262
- Oh, that's very good.

152
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:09,931
I'm gonna use that
liberally.

153
00:06:09,964 --> 00:06:12,433
Anyway, Weichselbraun's
$40,000 oboe

154
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:13,601
was stolen from his apartment,

155
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:15,336
and you need to find it.

156
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:17,004
I'd work the case myself

157
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,340
if it didn't smack
of preferential treatment.

158
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,442
- Don't worry, sir.
I can handle this.

159
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:24,111
- So you do think it smacks
of preferential treatment?

160
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:26,180
- I don't know what
you want me to say.

161
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:28,716
- Okay, you've convinced me.
I'll work the case with you.

162
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,554
- Great.

163
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,288
- I think you owe me
an apology.

164
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:36,724
- I'll apologize
to you in hell.

165
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,359
I actually don't know
what this is about.

166
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:39,727
Sorry I took
such a hard stance.

167
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:43,164
- Holt's celebrity was
just some lame oboist.

168
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:47,001
Meanwhile, we just linked
your little dumb pot bust

169
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:49,070
to a major narcotics ring.

170
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:51,238
This might be the biggest drug
case

171
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:53,407
the Nine-Nine's had in years.

172
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:55,342
- Cool.

173
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:57,078
- Uh-oh.

174
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:58,913
I know a real "cool"
when I hear one.

175
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,950
That wasn't a real "cool."
What did you do?

176
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:05,887
- Well...

177
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,923
I may have given
that very huge drug case

178
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:10,925
to Hitchcock and Scully.

179
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,393
- What?
- In my defense,

180
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:15,763
I was pretty sure you were
never gonna find out.

181
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:21,368
They're not answering
their phones,

182
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:23,805
and they signed our dealer—
the one link to our drug ring—

183
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:25,206
out of holding.

184
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,909
I swear, if they mess up
this case, Jake, it's on you.

185
00:07:27,975 --> 00:07:29,143
- They're detectives.

186
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:30,745
They've been on the force
for 500 years.

187
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,179
They know what they're doing.

188
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:35,182
- The only item on Scully's
calendar for the entire year

189
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:36,618
is "eat peanut butter."

190
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:37,919
- Yeah, we got to find them.

191
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:41,388
And to do that, we have
to think like they do.

192
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:44,091
I'm going in.

193
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:48,195
All right, there's
the butt indentation,

194
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,230
and...

195
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:50,231
[grunts]

196
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:51,232
I'm docked.

197
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:53,367
Ugh.
Still warm.

198
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,871
All right, residual cushion fart
is about a six out of ten.

199
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:58,439
He's been gone an hour,
maybe two.

200
00:07:58,505 --> 00:07:59,974
- But where?
- Hot dogs.

201
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:02,009
They went for hot dogs.
- How do you know?

202
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:04,979
- There's a water stain on the
ceiling in the shape of a bun.

203
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:06,013
Let's go.

204
00:08:08,182 --> 00:08:10,084
- Excuse me, have you
seen Hitchcock and Scully?

205
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:12,119
- Three times a day
for 12 years.

206
00:08:12,153 --> 00:08:14,521
Twice as often since I started
serving sweet wieners.

207
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:15,923
- Sweet wieners?

208
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:17,659
- It's a normal hot dog
with a little chocolate sauce.

209
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,160
- One please!
- No, Jake.

210
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:21,128
- No, Terry.
- Have you seen them recently?

211
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:23,297
- Half hour ago—they ate, and
then they took off in a hurry.

212
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,166
- [sighs]
Half an hour.

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,334
They could be anywhere by now.
Nope, there's Scully.

214
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,104
- Where's Hitchcock?

215
00:08:30,137 --> 00:08:31,673
I'm taking you guys
off your drug case.

216
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:32,774
- Of course you are.

217
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:34,175
Jake said you didn't
believe in us.

218
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,878
- What? He didn't
believe in you either.

219
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:39,446
He was just pumping you up with
lies so you'd work his case.

220
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,282
- Jake, is this true?

221
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:43,350
- I just thought,
you know,

222
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:44,686
the two of you might
be better off

223
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:46,688
mousing around the old house.

224
00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:48,690
- Oh, I get it.

225
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,492
Just because I got my finger
stuck in a glue trap once,

226
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm a mouse?

227
00:08:53,194 --> 00:08:54,696
I got the cheese out,
by the way.

228
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:56,330
- Oh, my God.
- Look, man,

229
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:57,865
we need to know
where Hitchcock is.

230
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,934
I am ordering you
to tell us everything.

231
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,303
- Fine.
We're setting up a sting.

232
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:04,538
I'm going undercover
as Tex Dallas,

233
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:06,708
billionaire oil man
from Dallas, Texas,

234
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,409
with ties
to the cowboy mafia.

235
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,611
- Oh, boy.
- Hitchcock's my middle man,

236
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:13,614
Reno Vegas,
mobster from Reno, Las Vegas.

237
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:15,116
- I said my "oh, boy"
too soon.

238
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:17,819
- In 20 minutes, he's going in
totally alone, unarmed,

239
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,821
without a cell phone,
to meet with one of their guys

240
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:21,088
to set up a buy.

241
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,724
So how do you like
our plan now?

242
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:25,426
- It's a disaster, man!
We got to stop it!

243
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,461
- Disaster? Tell me
one thing that's wrong

244
00:09:27,494 --> 00:09:28,930
with Operation Beans.

245
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:30,932
- Operation Beans?

246
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:34,769
- Good afternoon, sir.
I'm Detective Charles Boyle—

247
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:36,403
- From the Nine-Nine.

248
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:39,640
My precinct.
I'm the captain, Raymond Holt.

249
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:42,143
- Okay.
Uh, please, come on in.

250
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:44,611
I'll show you the back room
where they broke in.

251
00:09:44,645 --> 00:09:47,281
- You're an incredibly gracious
host, Mr. Weichselbraun.

252
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:49,817
- Wow, that pronunciation
is flawless.

253
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:51,618
- [laughs]

254
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:55,489
I must admit, I'm a bit
of a Weichselbrauniac.

255
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:59,526
Hmm, I saw you perform Bach's
"Oboe Sonata in G Minor"

256
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:00,862
at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music.

257
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,496
I was in the front row.

258
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,932
- You were escorted out
for gasping too loudly.

259
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,333
- Ah.

260
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,302
- This is a pretty
modest apartment.

261
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:11,538
How did you afford a $40,000
oboe in the first place?

262
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:13,374
- I admit that there's
not as much money

263
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,942
in classical music
as there once was—

264
00:10:14,976 --> 00:10:18,045
- Which is the real
crime here.

265
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:19,713
Boyle, can I
talk to you privately?

266
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:20,882
- Sure.

267
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:22,516
- What are you doing?
You just insulted

268
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:24,385
our celebrity victim
to his face.

269
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,553
- You keep saying "celebrity,"
but he's drying his socks

270
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,522
on a George Foreman grill.

271
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:31,025
- This is John William
Weichselbraun,

272
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:34,028
the Silver Spit Prince.

273
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:36,163
I'm making myself primary
detective on this case.

274
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:37,664
You can wait in the car.

275
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:39,533
Oh, but first, take a picture
of the two of us together.

276
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,068
Make sure we're laughing.

277
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,405
Ha-ha!

278
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:45,873
[chuckles]

279
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:47,341
Ah.

280
00:10:47,374 --> 00:10:52,179
- Okay, so, I'm going to face
my fear of confined spaces.

281
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:54,816
When I'm ready,
you will shut the trunk

282
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:57,184
and leave me here
for 30 minutes.

283
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:59,486
- I left a juice box
and a diaper in there for you,

284
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,055
so you're gonna be fine.

285
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:02,824
- Or we could all
give in to our fears

286
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,826
and keep our blood in
our bodies like normal people.

287
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:07,929
- No, Rosa, we are doing
something important here.

288
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:10,832
We are women, standing up
and supporting each other

289
00:11:10,832 --> 00:11:12,499
and becoming—

290
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,135
- New fear: listening
to Amy inspire us.

291
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:17,404
- Be back in
a half hour, Ames.

292
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:20,007
- Wait! Come back!

293
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:21,843
Come back, I can't do this!

294
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:24,078
- No, you're the best!
- [laughs]

295
00:11:28,615 --> 00:11:30,251
You did it.
How'd it go?

296
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:34,521
- Well, the first ten minutes
were really terrible.

297
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:37,491
The diaper did not fit.
It was for a baby.

298
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:42,263
But then I relaxed,
and I found my inner strength.

299
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:44,765
I think the lesson here is that,
as women, we—

300
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:46,033
No, no, no, no!

301
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,201
You close that trunk again
and I will kill you!

302
00:11:47,268 --> 00:11:49,536
You hear me?
I will kill you!

303
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:53,875
- We're almost there.
Slow down, Pinto.

304
00:11:53,941 --> 00:11:55,042
- I didn't agree to a bean name.

305
00:11:55,109 --> 00:11:57,211
We are not doing
Operation Beans.

306
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:59,480
- You know, the only reason
Hitchcock and I took this case

307
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:00,781
is because you said
we were great.

308
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:02,950
I'm beginning to think
you were lying to us.

309
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:05,519
- I was lying!
I already admitted that.

310
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:08,122
- Well, if anything happens,
it's because of you.

311
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:09,623
Right, Mung?
- Right.

312
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,425
If Hitchcock dies,
it's 'cause of Pinto.

313
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,693
- Terry, I know
that you're mad,

314
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:15,129
but you don't have
to jump on the bean train.

315
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:16,197
- Uh-oh.

316
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,568
- Chickpea!
No!

317
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:27,108
inside that building, and it
looks like they're armed.

318
00:12:27,141 --> 00:12:28,275
- Dammit, Jake!

319
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:29,810
You couldn't just do
the case I assigned you?

320
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:32,914
Hitchcock's life is in danger.
He has a wife, man.

321
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,481
- Don't worry.
If anything happens to him,

322
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:35,749
she'll be taken care of.

323
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:39,153
- If I die, I want you
to marry Lucille.

324
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,255
I can't stand the thought
of you being alone.

325
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,657
- Deal. Let's make it
a blood pact.

326
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:46,660
- Oh, look,
I'm already bleeding.

327
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,462
- So just
normal friend stuff.

328
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:51,265
- So what's the plan?
- We stick with Operation Beans.

329
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,935
We knock on the front door.
I say I'm Tex Dallas.

330
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,970
You're my buddy, Alamo,
and you're Black Fred.

331
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,305
- Black Fred?
Why Black Fred?

332
00:12:58,339 --> 00:12:59,673
There's no other Fred!

333
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,208
- Yeah, but they don't
know that.

334
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:02,376
- I say Terry and I go in

335
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:03,978
through the roof
and do some recon.

336
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,380
Scully, you stay here and call
for backup in case we need it.

337
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:07,714
- Oh, no way.

338
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:09,350
That's my partner in there.
I'm going in.

339
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:12,319
Also, I can't call for help.
I don't have any quarters.

340
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:14,721
- Hard to argue
with that logic.

341
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,324
- You know I—
- Sir, I need to talk to you

342
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:19,726
about the Weichselbraun case.

343
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,563
Oh, I didn't realize you
were here, Mr. Weichselbraun.

344
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,598
- I was in the area,
and the captain is a fan,

345
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:27,434
so I came by to give him
a little gift, as a thank you.

346
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:30,204
- It's a signed copy
of his book of mouth exercises.

347
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:33,440
"Reed It and Weep."
"Reed" with two Es?

348
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:35,242
It's my favorite joke
of all time.

349
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:36,777
- I'll come back later.
- Oh, nonsense.

350
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,846
I'm sure John—
he insists I call him "John"--

351
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,415
I'm sure John would
appreciate an update

352
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:44,051
on the whereabouts of his oboe,
wouldn't you, John?

353
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:45,419
- Yeah.
- Well said, John.

354
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:47,221
Did you hear what John said?
- I did,

355
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:48,555
but it's an open
investigation,

356
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,357
and I don't think it's proper
to share information

357
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:51,758
with the parties involved.

358
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,527
- Well, that's why you're
no longer the primary.

359
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,896
John played oboe for
Lynne Cheney.

360
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:57,864
I'm sure we can
trust him to be discreet.

361
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:58,865
Out with it.

362
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,034
- Okay, well,

363
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:01,035
John, you're under arrest.

364
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:02,369
- What?
- Excuse me?

365
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:04,605
- He staged the robbery
for the insurance money

366
00:14:04,638 --> 00:14:07,708
because he's broke, because
oboists are not celebrities.

367
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:09,476
- This is ludicrous, Boyle.

368
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,545
Do you have one iota
of evidence?

369
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:13,814
- I found the oboe
for sale online.

370
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:17,018
We traced the IP address back to
Mr. Weichselbraun's computer.

371
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,356
- Oh, John.

372
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:24,791
- Okay, Sarge, everyone
knows you're a superhero,

373
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,860
so you lower Scully and I
into that skylight

374
00:14:26,893 --> 00:14:28,162
and then fly down
to meet us.

375
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:29,896
- You know that's impossible.
- Fine.

376
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:31,165
We'll lower Scully
down together,

377
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,500
and then flop onto him
like a giant mattress.

378
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,702
- No, you go first,
then I lower Scully,

379
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:39,506
and you—
you get to catch him.

380
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,907
- Great.
I love that plan.

381
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:43,644
[quietly]
Come on.

382
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:45,912
- Whoa!
[both grunting]

383
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:47,048
- I got him.

384
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:55,389
Look what I found.
- French fries?

385
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:57,424
- What?
No, it's Hitchcock.

386
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:00,394
Where would I have found
French fries in a weed farm?

387
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:04,331
- Oh, man, look at him.
This is bad.

388
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:07,068
He hates standing up.

389
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:08,835
- To conquer my fear
of businessmen,

390
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:10,771
I must walk among them.

391
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,973
I will shake
their clammy hands

392
00:15:13,074 --> 00:15:15,976
and listen to them talk
about things like

393
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:19,113
how hard Wednesdays can be.

394
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:22,749
Does this outfit look
drab and lifeless enough?

395
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,985
Also, thanks, Amy,
for letting me borrow it.

396
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:28,155
- You're welcome.
I wore that suit to prom.

397
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,157
Student chaperone.

398
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,459
- I guess this
is really happening.

399
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:33,794
[inhales]

400
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:39,500
How about those
quarterly write-offs?

401
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,802
And did you hear
about the merger?

402
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:44,871
Also, we all need to go in
on those flowers for Beth.

403
00:15:44,938 --> 00:15:47,007
Aw, Wednesdays.

404
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:48,309
- Who are you again?

405
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:51,378
- Gina, from Sales.
I have the plant on my desk.

406
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:54,948
- Oh, yeah.
You want to sit with us.

407
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:56,650
- We'll all be
dead so soon.

408
00:15:56,683 --> 00:15:58,152
- What?

409
00:15:58,185 --> 00:15:59,520
- I would love to sit.

410
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,591
Ugh.

411
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,528
That was a nightmare.
I ate a Caesar salad wrap.

412
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:10,197
- I'm so proud of you,
you lioness.

413
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,365
You faced your fear.

414
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:14,701
- And I emerged victorious.

415
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:16,903
Yay!

416
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:17,904
[sighs]

417
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:19,640
- That was a wig?

418
00:16:19,706 --> 00:16:22,943
- You didn't think I'd put
my actual hair in a ponytail?

419
00:16:22,976 --> 00:16:24,145
Are you insane?

420
00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:25,479
- Oh, there's the boss.

421
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:31,252
- I ask only one time.
Who do you work for?

422
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,954
DEA? FBI? Police?

423
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,889
- I'm in the cowboy mafia.

424
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:38,058
I work for the Dallas
Buyers Club.

425
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,893
- I came up with that name.
- No, you didn't.

426
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,995
It's a movie about AIDS.

427
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:44,798
- You're lying.
Let's try again.

428
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,567
FBI?
- Oof!

429
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,068
- DEA?
- [grunts]

430
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:49,403
- Police?
- Aah!

431
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:51,071
- Oh no,
he's not gonna last.

432
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:52,673
Oh, Jake, you got
to do something.

433
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:55,008
I don't want to
marry Hitchcock's wife.

434
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,311
- Here we come, Chickpea.

435
00:16:57,344 --> 00:17:00,647
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Easy!

436
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:01,682
Howdy there!

437
00:17:01,715 --> 00:17:03,684
I'd really appreciate it
kindly

438
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:06,653
if y'all would stop punching
my associate Reno, there.

439
00:17:06,687 --> 00:17:09,656
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Alamo.

440
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,758
This here's Tex,
and this is—

441
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,394
- Fred.
Just Fred.

442
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:16,697
- And we are...

443
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,365
the Dallas Buyers Club.

444
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,767
- Okay.
We make a deal.

445
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,102
[speaks Serbian]

446
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:23,337
- [chuckles]
Sounds good.

447
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,871
- No, I just told them
to surround you.

448
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:26,740
- Dagnabbit.
Oof!

449
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:32,779
but on the bright side,

450
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,848
we don't have to deal
with some lame oboist.

451
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,950
- You should be apologizing
to Hitchcock and Scully.

452
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:39,620
You took them out of their
house mouse comfort zone,

453
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:40,887
and now they might get killed.

454
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:43,257
- You really think
they're going to kill us?

455
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,792
Oh, no, now I'm starting
to panic sweat.

456
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,127
- Starting to?

457
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:48,429
What have you been doing
for the past hour?

458
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:50,564
- Normal sweating.
- Wait a minute.

459
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:54,401
If you get killed,
what happens to all your debt?

460
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:57,103
Loophole!

461
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,842
- Oh, you sweaty,
chair-spinning morons.

462
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,444
You're gonna get us
out of here.

463
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:07,348
- Boyle, may I speak to you?

464
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:08,515
- I don't know.

465
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,651
Are you still mad
that I arrested John?

466
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:13,019
- No.

467
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:15,989
I know he's guilty.
I'm just chagrined.

468
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:17,858
Deeply chagrined.

469
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:21,495
I finally understand the old
adage, "Never meet your heroes."

470
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:25,366
This is just like when I found
out Robert Frost was from...

471
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,067
California.

472
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:28,569
- Or when I saw Mario Batali
with his hair down.

473
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:30,170
[shudders]

474
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,673
- Well, you've handled this case
with the utmost professionalism,

475
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:36,343
while I've behaved crassly.

476
00:18:36,377 --> 00:18:38,679
I think I've figured out
a way to make it up to you.

477
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:41,482
- Oh, my God,
is Dianne Wiest here?

478
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:44,718
- No, I've hired a trio
of classical musicians

479
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:46,887
to perform
a Shostakovich cantata,

480
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,358
originally written as
an apology to a dear friend.

481
00:18:54,094 --> 00:18:56,196
Are you stealing
kitchen supplies?

482
00:18:56,297 --> 00:18:57,731
- Just let us
have this stuff.

483
00:18:57,764 --> 00:18:59,833
You have so much,
and we have so little.

484
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:02,803
- Perhaps I'll just
buy you a drink instead.

485
00:19:02,836 --> 00:19:04,971
- Yeah, that would be best.

486
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:08,309
Classical musicians
are savages.

487
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:10,010
- They're not gonna
kill you fast, Scully.

488
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,745
They're gonna
make it real slow.

489
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:12,946
First they're gonna scalp you,

490
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,748
and then they're gonna
rip your tongue out!

491
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:17,318
- No.
That's my cupcake taster!

492
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,985
- What are you doing?
Lay off him!

493
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,323
- Never! For my plan to work,
he's gotta be basting in sweat.

494
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:24,958
Hitchcock, you once told me you
could roll that chair anywhere.

495
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:26,527
Think you could take it
up those stairs?

496
00:19:26,593 --> 00:19:28,429
- I once rode a chair home
in a blizzard.

497
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:31,097
So, yeah, I can go up stairs.

498
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,799
- So do it.

499
00:19:36,337 --> 00:19:38,104
Oh, he's amazing.

500
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:40,774
He's like a big, lazy
Michelle Kwan.

501
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:43,109
But how's he gonna get
up the stairs?

502
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:45,612
- Jake!
He already did.

503
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:49,783
- Okay, it's go time.

504
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,218
Help!
My man's having a heart attack!

505
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:54,688
Help!

506
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:55,789
Hitchcock, now!

507
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:57,791
- [grunts]

508
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:00,727
- Scully!
Grab his gun.

509
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:04,197
- [roars]

510
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,833
It's not sticky
because I'm so juicy!

511
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:08,134
- Told you I knew
what I was doing.

512
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:09,536
- Black Fred, think quick.

513
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,738
- No, no, ow!
That was a gun, man!

514
00:20:11,805 --> 00:20:14,475
- Scully, grab that dude's knife
and cut us loose.

515
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:16,076
We're gonna get the rest
of these guys.

516
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:20,747
It's time for Operation Beans,
phase two, the refrying.

517
00:20:20,814 --> 00:20:22,416
- Sure you're ready to go
through with this?

518
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:24,851
- You know what?
Today was stupid.

519
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:27,253
But seeing you both overcome
your fears did help me,

520
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,056
and I think we've
all grown as women.

521
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:33,093
- Okay.

522
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,895
- I'm ready.

523
00:20:34,928 --> 00:20:36,763
Stab me! Stab me!

524
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,231
Do it, just do it!

525
00:20:38,264 --> 00:20:40,233
- Rosa?
- I'm psyching myself up.

526
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:42,736
[yells]

527
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:44,705
Don't look at them!
Look at me!

528
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:47,574
Do your job!
Drain me!

529
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:48,609
[elevator bell dings]

530
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:51,545
- There they are!

531
00:20:51,578 --> 00:20:53,914
Everybody give it up
for Hitchcock and Scully.

532
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:55,782
[applause]

533
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,183
- To thank you
for all you did,

534
00:20:57,217 --> 00:21:00,421
bringing down a drug ring,

535
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:01,955
we have a little present
for you:

536
00:21:01,988 --> 00:21:04,257
brand-new, top-of-the-line
desk chairs,

537
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,828
extra padding, with adjustable
height and recline.

538
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:09,930
- Hey, chair!

539
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:11,965
Get ready to meet
your new best friend:

540
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:14,267
my ass.

541
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,470
[both groaning happily]

542
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:17,771
- That was very nice of you.

543
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:18,972
- They did good.

544
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:20,140
Also, I was worried
they might want

545
00:21:20,173 --> 00:21:21,442
to go out in the field more,

546
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,777
and I need something to
keep them at their desks.

547
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,212
- You really think that that
is going to keep them at their—

548
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:28,014
and they're both
asleep already.

549
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:29,850
- And the city's
safer for it.

550
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:32,052
- Sleep tight,
you magnificent oafs.

551
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:33,487
You deserve it.

552
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,355
- Fremulon.

553
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:37,023
- Not a doctor.
- Shh!
