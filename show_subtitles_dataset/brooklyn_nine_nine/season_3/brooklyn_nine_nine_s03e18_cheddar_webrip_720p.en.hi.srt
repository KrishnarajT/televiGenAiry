and singed leg hair

175
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,853
is finally dissipating.

176
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,687
- I just hope I can
grow it back by Speedo season.

177
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,156
[phone rings]

178
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,458
- Call from Raymond Holt,
mobile.

179
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,592
- Oh, no. Not Holt.

180
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,927
- Don't worry.
I've got this.

181
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,366
- Bonjour, Captain.
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

182
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:57,101
- No, I don't
want to sleep with you.

183
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,435
- Is that what that means?

184
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:01,072
Oh, man, I had a really gross
tennis instructor.

185
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:03,240
- I'm calling to check in
before I get on the flight.

186
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,276
Everything okay?
- [scoffs] Okay?

187
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,412
Let's just say if the house
could talk, she would say,

188
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:11,115
"I've never been happier;
I love Jake."

189
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,616
- Oh, that's interesting,
because I think

190
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,686
the house might say
"Jake's a liar, and I'm...

191
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:17,254
on fire."

192
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:18,589
- What's that now?

193
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:19,957
- The security company
called me about the alarm.

194
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,626
- Okay, the house
was never on fire.

195
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,029
Charles was on fire,
and only on his pants,

196
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:26,230
and we put it out.

197
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,431
- I'm coming home right now.

198
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:28,900
- Wait, no.
Sir, please don't do that.

199
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,801
You have to go see Kevin.
Everything's fine.

200
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:33,304
- No, my decision is final.
I'm postponing my flight.

201
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,305
Good-bye, Jacob.

202
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,973
- No, sir!
Please, please—ahh!

203
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,541
He said "Jacob."

204
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:38,943
It's biblical.

205
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,144
Guys, guys!

206
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,445
Holt is headed home
right now.

207
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,080
- No!
He can't come home.

208
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,815
We left the door open,
and the dog ran out.

209
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,950
- What? We lost Cheddar?

210
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,121
- These silences
are very hard for me to read.

211
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,289
What's the vibe in here?
- We're freaking out, Charles!

212
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,831
What we have here
is a fugitive situation.

213
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:02,533
Our man has been on the run
for 30 minutes.

214
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,502
Also,
our man is a dog.

215
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:07,238
Now, I know what
some of you are thinking:

216
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,340
"Who cares?
It's just a pet."

217
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,008
- No one was thinking that,
you monster.

218
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,344
- Good.
That was a test.

219
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,846
Now, the average foot speed
of a corgi

220
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,081
is ten miles per hour,

221
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,050
which means
with every passing second,

222
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,019
that slippery bastard
gets farther away.

223
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,356
[mellow music]

224
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,692
- Captain Holt does not know
Cheddar is missing...

225
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,094
but he's gonna find out.

226
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,396
Oh, God, I feel like the devil
is dancing on my chest.

227
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,431
- It's all right, Amy.
We have time.

228
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:36,033
Gina's picking Holt up
at the airport,

229
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,335
and she told me she can stall
him for at least two hours.

230
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:42,006
- I'll do it, but I'm gonna
have to total your car.

231
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,741
- Or you could just
drive slowly.

232
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,610
- Ha-ha, she's gonna
wreck your car.

233
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:47,678
- Here's where we're at.

234
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:49,113
Amy and I will take
Blind Charles

235
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,181
and search the neighborhood.

236
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:51,348
Diaz, Pimento—

237
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:52,716
- Bring the dog back,

238
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,051
dead or alive.

239
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:55,987
- What? No.
I was gonna say hang posters.

240
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,289
Terry, maybe go with them,
make sure nobody gets killed.

241
00:08:58,355 --> 00:08:59,756
- Or maybe I could
join another group

242
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,125
with a different kind of energy?

243
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:02,526
- Jake, what about
me and Hitchcock?

244
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:03,995
- You two grab Cheddar's treats

245
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:05,529
and put 'em in a bowl outside.

246
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:07,764
- You mean the little sausage
ones that need way more salt?

247
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,001
- On second thought, maybe just
sit exactly where you are

248
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:11,002
and don't touch anything.

249
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:12,203
- Sweet.

250
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,705
- All right, everyone,
it's time to do this.

251
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:18,142
For Captain Holt,
for Kevin, for America!

252
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:20,011
- Let's go, Nine-Nine!

253
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,012
[groans]

254
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:23,147
- This line is interminable.

255
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,316
At this rate,
we'll be home in 54 minutes

256
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,384
instead of the usual 46.

257
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,886
- Not if I have
anything to do with it.

258
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:31,122
Watch me now!

259
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,289
[tires squealing]

260
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:33,724
- No, Gina, the wrong way.

261
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,459
No, Gina, the spikes!

262
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,495
- Uh-oh.

263
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:39,530
Well, not a problem.

264
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:41,232
I can get you home
on two wheels.

265
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,467
[tires pop]

266
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,403
And that was
the second pair of tires.

267
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:54,045
- Mm.

268
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,146
- I could've done that.

269
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,847
- Yeah, I know you could've.

270
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,183
But you didn't.
I did.

271
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,190
- I mean, there are lots
of other poles, guys.

272
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:07,858
A whole street
full of 'em.

273
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,260
- So, Adrian,

274
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:10,727
when are we gonna
stop messing around

275
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,096
and do this thing?

276
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:15,099
- Um...

277
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,335
N-never.
- What?

278
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,171
- You know what?
I just realized.

279
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:23,274
I forgot something at home.
I'm just gonna—

280
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,713
- That was weird.
You okay?

281
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:32,383
- Yes.

282
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,419
[grunting]

283
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,024
- All right,
according to the call

284
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,359
we just got on the tip line,

285
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,027
someone said they saw
Cheddar on this block.

286
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,429
- I'll head north.
Jake, you head west.

287
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,797
We'll meet back
in a half hour.

288
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,399
- Great, which direction
should I go?

289
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:51,468
[both mouthing words]

290
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,737
What's going on?
I can hear your lips moving.

291
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,206
Ah!
Are you guys kissing?

292
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,207
- What? No.

293
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,041
Charles, stop always
asking that.

294
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,477
Look, I'm sorry,
but you have to stay in the car.

295
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,945
- That's a mistake!

296
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,348
My super senses are a tool
you can't afford to leave

297
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:05,849
in the tool chest.

298
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,552
Take me out of the box
and put me on your belt.

299
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:10,987
- I'm sorry, but you'd
only slow us down.

300
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,823
And that's exactly
what Cheddar wants.

301
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,158
That's right.

302
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:17,161
I'm onto you,
you slippery little bastard.

303
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:19,630
[mellow music]

304
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,032
- Gina, come on.

305
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,467
You can do your Internet
socializing in the truck.

306
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,137
- Okay, cool, I just have
to tie my shoe real quick.

307
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,804
Tying it.

308
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,473
Call Jake Peralta.

309
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,642
- Gina, hey,
how's the stalling?

310
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:32,976
- Great; the tow truck
just got here,

311
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,478
so that'll buy us
at least an hour.

312
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,313
- Tow truck? What the hell
did you do to my car?

313
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,315
- Bitch, I told you
I was gonna wreck it.

314
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,416
- You did.
You did.

315
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,917
All right, well,
we're about to go

316
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,586
follow up on a lead
right now.

317
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:45,055
- Great; I'm gonna rip a bunch
of wires out of your dashboard.

318
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,158
- What? No, don't!
Gina—

319
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,159
Gah!

320
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,228
- I got nothing.
Did you find Cheddar?

321
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:54,531
- Close.
I found Shredder.

322
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,833
- Shredder, no!
No, Shredder!

323
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,502
- You're not Cheddar!

324
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:01,738
I know it looks bad,
but we're gonna find him.

325
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,607
Right after we find Charles.

326
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,276
Charles is gone.
We lost Charles.

327
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,444
- What?
- Charles? Charles!

328
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,745
[toy squeaks]
Here, boy!

329
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:09,780
[toy squeaks]
Here, boy!

330
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:16,287
He's so pocket-sized.
He could be hidden anywhere!

331
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,189
- Jake, we need
to focus on Cheddar.

332
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,191
Charles is a grown man.
He can take care of himself.

333
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:21,992
- No, he's not.
He's a Charles, all right?

334
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:22,993
And he's blind!

335
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:24,695
Oh, God,
he's probably already dead.

336
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,763
- Right? So let's not waste
any resources on him.

337
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,265
[cell phone rings]
- Wait, it's Charles.

338
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,367
Charles?
- Jake? Is that you?

339
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,502
I can't see my phone.

340
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,304
I've dialed
over 40 wrong numbers.

341
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,805
- It's me.
- I found Cheddar.

342
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,207
- He found Cheddar!

343
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,374
- Which is why I was like,
"We need to go to him."

344
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,475
- Charles, where are you?

345
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,010
- I've got him cornered

00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:01,024
Nope.

519
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,627
- Oh, there he is.

520
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,697
Captain Holt!
Oh, he can't hear me.

521
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,165
[car alarm blaring]

522
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,667
Eh...
[car alarm blares]

523
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:13,670
Okay, well, I guess we know
what those wires did.

524
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:16,039
- I'm not in the mood
for your antics, Peralta.

525
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,207
- Sir, sir!

526
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,975
I think we know
where Cheddar is.

527
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,011
Will you please
just get in the car?

528
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:22,512
- [sighs]

529
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:27,217
- Oh, let me get that.

530
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,752
Try now.

531
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,353
Oh, I can't control
the locks.

532
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,856
Hang on. Try now.
One, two, three.

533
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,891
Try now. Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

534
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,627
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

535
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,994
Try now.
Try now.

536
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,429
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

537
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:40,831
Try now.

538
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,498
- Cheddar!

539
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:43,667
Come here, baby.

540
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,502
Yeah, yeah.

541
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,939
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

542
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:50,273
How did you know
he was here?

543
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,209
- Well, Cheddar was only
chewing up Kevin's stuff.

544
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:54,711
I figured maybe
he was acting out

545
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,680
because he missed Kevin.

546
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:59,115
- But the real hero here
is the binder.

547
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:00,851
Under "Cheddar,"
subsection "Walk,"

548
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,585
subsection "Walks with Kevin,"

549
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,454
we found this special spot.

550
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,189
- So you're missing Kevin, huh?

551
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:07,357
You're not the only one.

552
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,192
[sighs]

553
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,594
I didn't cancel my trip
because I was worried

554
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,563
you would burn my house down.

555
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:16,867
Kevin and I are having
a hard time right now.

556
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,535
Whenever we talk,
we fight.

557
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,938
And I'm just afraid
and just—

558
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:26,142
just afraid that if I go
to Paris and we fight, then...

559
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:29,279
- Sir, with all due respect,
that's crazy.

560
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,248
I mean, you and Kevin
are the best couple I know.

561
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:36,820
And I'm sure whatever this is,
you can get through it,

562
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,455
because you are
the strongest person I know.

563
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,825
Wow, that was weird;
I said, like, multiple

564
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:44,661
real things
consecutively, yeah.

565
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:46,496
Felt weird but good.
Are you proud of me?

566
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:47,563
- You're ruining it.
- Yup.

567
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:48,832
I'm just gonna
stop talking now.

568
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,166
- Well, I suppose
I'm not gonna solve anything

569
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,802
by running away from it.

570
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,737
Perhaps I should go
to Paris.

571
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,673
What do you think, Cheddar?
Huh?

572
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,175
Oh, my, oh!
You really are acting out!

573
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:02,713
Whew!
I'm sorry you had to see that.

574
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,080
- Oh.

575
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:07,918
- You know,
it's moments like these

576
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,252
that I'm grateful for your—

577
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,887
[car alarm blaring]

578
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:14,424
- Guys, it's a miracle!
I can see!

579
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,726
- Not now, Charles!
- Shut up!

580
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,927
- Right, sorry!

581
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,896
[car alarm blaring]
Sorry.

582
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,266
- Fremulon.

583
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,901
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
