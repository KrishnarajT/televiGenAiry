182
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:39,050
to the Park Slope Racquet Club,
where we've established

183
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,852
a squash doubles dynasty.

184
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:43,187
- We've taken home the trophy
two years in a row.

185
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,189
Unfortunately, I'll be flying
to Paris this year

186
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,358
during the tournament.

187
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,125
It's a seven-hour flight.
- [whistles]

188
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:50,227
- I remember you told me
you played in college.

189
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,864
- Three-time intramural
champion at Sarah Lawrence.

190
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:55,066
Would have been four, but
senior year I played Greaseball

191
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,201
in our school's production
of "Starlight Express."

192
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:58,803
- Interesting casting.

193
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,105
In any case, I would be honored
if you would take my place

194
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:02,774
so that Raymond
could make it a treble.

195
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:05,377
- Absolutely!
I would love to do that!

196
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:06,678
- Great.
- Formidable.

197
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,712
- Yup!

198
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,382
That is great.
This is great.

199
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,450
This is terrible.
- Why?

200
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:14,452
You always said you wanted
more face time with Holt.

201
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:15,520
- No, not like this.

202
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:17,489
Squash brings out
my competitive side.

203
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:20,392
breaking racquets, cursing,
excessive mooning.

204
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,126
One time, just to
psych a guy out,

205
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,062
I locked eyes with him
and ate a squash ball.

206
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,063
- That's not possible.

207
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,965
- It's still in me, Terry.

208
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:29,801
- Look, the point
is to have fun.

209
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,202
So just relax
and have fun.

210
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,470
- Right, right,
right, yeah.

211
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:33,538
It's just a game.

212
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:34,872
It's fun.

213
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:37,409
There's no need
for Holt to see me

214
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:38,910
unleash the beast.

215
00:06:38,976 --> 00:06:41,713
[laughs]
Okay.

216
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:44,081
- That's a strange
little man.

217
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,683
- Probably telling Captain Holt
how much they like

218
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:48,420
to sauna together.
- Please.

219
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,421
They think they're so great
just 'cause

220
00:06:49,421 --> 00:06:50,488
they know
each other's allergies.

221
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:51,689
You know
what I'm allergic to?

222
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:52,990
- Yup. Them.
- Totally.

223
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:55,092
And also bees.
You should know that.

224
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,061
If I got stung by a bee,
I could die.

225
00:06:57,094 --> 00:06:58,596
- Detectives, I've been talking
with the inspectors.

226
00:06:58,663 --> 00:07:01,599
There's been a development
in the Kottbullediamant case.

227
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,000
- Excellent pronunciation,
Captain.

228
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:04,569
- Tack.
They believe our perp

229
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:05,637
may have smuggled more

230
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,171
stolen Swedish diamonds
into Brooklyn.

231
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:08,573
- Oh, well,
thank you for the tip.

232
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:10,007
Have a wonderful flight home.

233
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:12,076
We will send you the jewels
as soon as we find them.

234
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,512
- They're staying and
working the case with you.

235
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,280
- Ah, fantastic.

236
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:18,616
Rosa, could you please fill
my car with a million bees?

237
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:24,789
let's talk
anniversary gift.

238
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:27,291
Should I get Amy something
caszh like shot glasses,

239
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:31,262
or something less caszh,
like golden shot glasses?

240
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:32,697
- Still don't care.
How about I get a jump

241
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:34,832
on our new partners
and search the perp's apartment?

242
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:37,201
- Right. We'll get some
clues, solve the case,

They can eat our
American dust.

- No, no.

246
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:43,475
Soren is probably
allergic to dust.

247
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:44,476
- Oh, hello!

248
00:07:44,476 --> 00:07:46,143
Yes, I am allergic
to dust.

249

That's what sneezes are.

What are you guys
doing here?

254
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,485
- Oh, in Sweden,
we call it police work.

255
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:55,152
Perhaps you don't
have a word for it?

256
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:56,988
- [whispers] I hate you.
- This is our case.

257
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:58,222
You can't work it
without us.

258
00:07:58,289 --> 00:07:59,891
Get your weird,
hairless fingers off of it.

259
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,893
- Soren shaves his fingers
for cycling.

260
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,194
It cuts down on drag.

261
00:08:03,227 --> 00:08:04,529
- Agneta is my
biggest fanatic.

262
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:07,098
Just as I am a fanatic
of her slam poetry.

263
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:09,200
Would you like to hear some?
- Would I like to?

264
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:11,202
I would hate to!
- Your loss.

265
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:13,237
Well, we've already searched
the entire apartment.

266
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,972
- Yeah, well,
now we're gonna search it,

267
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,809
and find things you all missed,
like this!

268
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,876
- Your own keys?

269
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,877
- Damn straight.

For instance,
here's one that

274
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,387
Hollywood doesn't
want you to know.

275
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:34,526
A parsec is actually
a measure of distance.

276
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:36,994
One of the many inaccuracies
in the "Star Wars" universe.

277
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:40,164
- Uh-huh.
And what's "Star Wars"?

278
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:41,398

279
00:08:41,432 --> 00:08:43,167
Maybe I'm getting ahead
of myself.

280
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,670
Okay, let's talk planets.

281
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:48,239
Jupiter is a gas giant.

282
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:49,240
- So is Hitchcock.

283
00:08:49,273 --> 00:08:50,274
How does this help me?

284
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:52,443
