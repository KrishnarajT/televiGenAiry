377

I've only heard from him
once this week,

378
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:39,419

he'd finally come up with

379

drinking that stuff?

385
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,097
- Yeah, Holt got me
hooked on it.

386
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:52,599
I even got a bottle
for my house.

387

figured something out.

You friended the vulture?

398

- Well, he's not
telling us anything,

399
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,563
so it was the only way
to figure out what he likes.

400
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:23,664
- Maybe this will help.

401
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:25,666
He just said his
favorite color is underboob.

402

that hard work pays off.

and the Junkyard Rats.

but here,
take that.

425

be seen together.

Gina, did you know about this?

427

- Uh, tricking you was
the only way

428
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:15,415
I could get you
to talk to him.

429

Plus, you know
I heart intrigue.

- Sir, take a look
at these photos.

431
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:22,222
None of the victims had any
alcohol in their apartments.

432

Not even a dusty bottle.

You want to know why?

434
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,760
Because they were all sober.

435
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:28,829
They all attended
12-step programs.

436
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:29,830
None of them the same one,

437
00:14:29,896 --> 00:14:31,632

the same leader,

438

of torturing animals.

my friend's mind over here.

this lunatic some rye?

446

James Dylan Borden,

447
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,984

at creep-a-palooza—

448

in Red Hook.

for screwing up this case.

I shouldn't even be talking
to you.

Wuntch can probably
hear us right now.

454
