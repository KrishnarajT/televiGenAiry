00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:21,002
- What?

181
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,003
Don't ask her that!
- Okay.

182
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:23,505
- Jake,
all you have to do

183
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:24,806
is keep her comfortable.

184
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,541
I'm on my way.
- Okay, sounds good.

185
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:28,175
And do you want to just
meet us at the hospital or—

186
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:29,411
both: No hospital!

187
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:30,412
- Okay. Got it.
Got it.

188
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:31,679
Cool, cool, cool.
No hospital.

189
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:33,415
I am picking up
what you're screaming down.

190
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:34,682
- We had a terrible
experience

191
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,017
when Cagney and Lacey
were born.

192
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,419
- Last time we went
to the hospital,

193
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,421
they pushed me
to have a C-section,

194
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,688
didn't have enough rooms,

195
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:43,057
and the anesthesiologist
was a med student

196
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,427
who stabbed me
in the spinal cord

197
00:05:45,427 --> 00:05:47,328
ten times before
he got it right!

198
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:49,431
- See?
Needles in your spine?

199
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:51,433
Childbirth is
a horror movie.

200
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,434
- That is not helping.

201
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,701
- Jake,
there's a copy of our

202
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:55,336
birth plan on my desk.

203
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:56,838
Call the doula.
- Copy that.

204
00:05:56,871 --> 00:05:58,239
I will call the doula.

205
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,241
Which is a thing that
I definitely know what it is.

206
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:01,743
- A doula is someone
who supports you

207
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:02,910
emotionally
and physically

208
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:04,612
and coaches you through
the process.

209
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:05,613
- Oh, I see.

210
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:06,914
So sort of like
a vaginal Gandalf?

211
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,583
- Stop saying that word!

212
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:09,951
- Ooh, that's actually
a pretty good analogy.

213
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,619
- Well, Sharon liked it,
Sarge.

214
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,354
All right, listen, you have
nothing to worry about.

215
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:15,590
I've got it totally
under control here.

216
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:17,492
Love you, bye.
Great.

217
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:19,293
So I'm gonna go
get your birth plan

218
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:21,162
and then summon
your wizard.

219
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,964
- Oh, Sharon, I heard you had
gone into labor

220
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:24,298
in our police station.

221
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:26,033
I hope you don't
contract an infection.

222
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,268
- Yeah, we all hope that.

223
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:28,503
- Hey, Cap-i-tan,

224
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:29,604
Could I speak with
you outside

225
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:32,039
for just one moment?

226
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:33,708
- Don't leave me.

227
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:36,310
- Listen, you've got
your plate full today,

228
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:38,513
and this whole
Sharon having a baby thing

229
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:40,114
is honestly beneath you.

230
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:41,783
- But I know a lot
about childbirth.

231
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,051
My ex-boyfriend,
Frederick was an OB/GYN

232
00:06:44,118 --> 00:06:46,554
and we would often
talk about his work.

233
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:48,823
Before he started talking
about it with...

234
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:50,492
Dave.

235
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,226
- Well, you should probably
know that I also

236
00:06:52,293 --> 00:06:54,161
have a lot of experience
with childbirth.

237
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,730
- And, with a final grunt,

238
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:58,232
the mighty rhino
expels her calf.

239
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:00,101
- Ugh!

240
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:03,505
Gross!
Come out of an egg next time.

241
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:04,972
- I'm gonna go check in
on Sharon.

242
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,808
Make sure she's not
pushing prematurely—

243
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,109
fatiguing the uterus.

244
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:11,879
- Okay, wait,
you can't talk to her!

245
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:13,881
Terry doesn't want you
in there.

246
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:17,051
You make her
uncomfortable.

247
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,520
- I make her
uncomfortable?

248
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,787
- [sighs]

249
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:21,523
- Well, that's ridiculous.

250
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:22,524
I should go confront her

251
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:23,525
about this at length.

252
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:24,526
- No, wait!

253
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,727
You could, but

254
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,928
I think that would
probably stress her out

255
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:27,962
and we're trying to
keep her calm right now.

256
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:29,731
So maybe just...

257
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:31,332
Focus on work?

258
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:32,399
- Of course.

259
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:33,400
I only want to help.

260
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,936
Whatever's best
for Sharon.

261
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:35,937
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,138
- You're fine
with that?

263
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:38,606
- Absolutely.
I don't take it personally.

264
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,642
I mean, it's about me
and my behavior, specifically,

265
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:42,343
nobody else—
not Hitchcock or Scully,

266
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,912
but yeah, I'm fine.

267
00:07:44,946 --> 00:07:46,147
What a joyous occasion.

268
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:49,817
- So...

269
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:51,118
Sharon's water
just broke.

270
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:52,587
- Are you kidding?
Let's go!

271
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,755
- Hold up.

272
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,323
This guy knows where
our murderer is hiding.

273
00:07:56,357 --> 00:07:58,593
Just give me two minutes
alone with him.

274
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:00,361
I'll let him know what's
gonna happen to him

275
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:02,063
if he doesn't cooperate.

276
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,197
[crying]
I'm gonna miss the birth

277
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,899
of my child!

278
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:06,701
It's a magical moment!

279
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:08,570
- [crying]
Okay, okay!

280
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,037
I'll tell you
everything.

281
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,573
Thank you for
letting me be part

282
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,575
of this wonderful
experience.

283
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:15,376
- You're a terrible
person,

284
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,378
but you're welcome.

285
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:18,713
- There you go.

286
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:19,914
All right.

287
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:21,282
Safe and sound.

288
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:23,417
So I spoke with
your doily—

289
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,886
- Doula.
- So close.

290
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:25,953
And, unfortunately,
she is

291
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,088
out of town
for Thanksgiving.

292
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:28,122
- What?

293
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:29,591
- I also spoke with
your backup doula,

294
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:30,592
who is in town.

295
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,626
- Oh, thank God.

296
00:08:31,693 --> 00:08:32,594
- But is assisting
with another birth.

297
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:33,928
- Ugh!

298
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,597
Should not have paused
between those two sentences.

299
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,464
- Yeah.
- Jake, where's Terry?

300
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,933
- I don't know,
exactly,

301
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,034
but everything
is okay.

302
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,235
I have familiarized
myself

303
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:42,970
with the soothing section
of your birth plan,

304
00:08:43,037 --> 00:08:44,405
and I will now
speak in a low,

305
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:46,207
calming,
Barry White voice.

306
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,609
[imitating Barry White]
Oh, yeah.

307
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,310
Just breathe, baby.

308
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:50,645
- You're making me
more tense.

309
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:52,113
- Yeah, I get why.

310
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:55,316
I'm doing a bad,
bad job, girl.

311
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:57,251
- How about we put on
some relaxing music?

312
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,386
I think that Terry's got
some CDs on his desk.

313
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,988
- Oh, great.
Hey, Gina, can you grab those?

314
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:02,824
- I have made the
mistake of looking

315
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:04,792
at the birthing plan
and just learned

316
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:06,661
what an episiotomy is.

317
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:09,496
I'm gonna need 90 minutes.

318
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,298
- Okay.
I'll grab the CDs.

319
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:13,500
Be right back.

320
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:14,702
Oh, hey, sir,
thank you again

321
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:15,837
for letting us
use your office.

322
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,871
- I'm fine.

323
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:17,872
I'm getting
a lot of work done

324
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:18,873
here at Gina's desk.

325
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:20,007
It's wonderful.

326
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:20,975
She has all my favorite
chewing gums.

327
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,076
- Okay, well,
I'm just getting

328
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:23,177
some CDs from
Terry's desk

329
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,646
to help relax
Sharon.

330
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:25,647
- I don't know why
you're telling me.

331
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:26,648
I'm not involved.

332
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:29,817
You made that
very clear.

333
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:34,421
- All right.

334
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:35,923
- Do you work here?
- I do.

335
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,558
- My son was arrested
six hours ago,

336
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,893
and nobody
can tell me

337
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,094
when he's getting out.

338
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:41,095
What is going on?

339
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:43,564
[crowd arguing]

340
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:44,699
- Uh-huh.

341
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:45,900
Yup.

342
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,101
Great question.

343
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:48,936
I will be right
with you folks.

344
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:50,171
[door shutting]

345
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:51,706
Guys, we have clear
some of these people.

346
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:53,340
I'm trying to keep things
calm for Sharon,

347
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:54,341
and this is not helping.

348
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,576
- I don't know
what to tell you.

349
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:57,378
I'm already writing
dangerously fast.

350
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:58,545
It's Smudge City
here, Jake.

351
00:09:58,579 --> 00:09:59,681
Smudge City!

352
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:00,547
- I mean, the problem is,

353
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:01,615
we only have
one fax machine,

354
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:03,250
and it takes four minutes
per page.

355
00:10:03,284 --> 00:10:05,619
It's Logjam City, Jake.
Logjam City!

356
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,689
- Well, Sharon is about
to have a baby, all right?

357
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:09,590
So I need it to be Calm City
in here.

358
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:10,858
Calm City!

359
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:12,593
- Hey, if you need
more fax machines,

360
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:14,195
there's a ton of them
in that storage room

361
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:15,296
where I go to take a nap.

362
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:16,430
both: What?

363
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,765
- Why didn't you
say something?

364
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,766
- And once again,

365
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,367
Hitchcock and Scully
save the day.

366
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,203
- You didn't do anything.
It was all Scully.

367
00:10:22,236 --> 00:10:24,571
- We're a package deal,
everyone knows that.

368
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:25,807
- Why is this
train stopped?

369
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:27,074
I'm freaking out!

370
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:28,609
- Sorry for the delay,
but it turns out

371
00:10:28,642 --> 00:10:30,144
there's an
exciting reason:

372
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:32,113
The train in front of us has
a pregnant woman on board,

373
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:33,380
and she's giving birth.

374
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:34,381
[cheers and applause]]

375
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:36,050
- Oh, don't applaud that!

376
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,252
Hey, this is terrible!

377
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,087
I'm sorry,
but my wife is

378
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:41,989
giving birth
right now too!

379
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:43,424
[weak applause]

380
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:45,059
No, that's not
what I want!

381
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,427
It feels real forced.

382
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,295
Move this train!

383
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,430
- All right,

384
00:10:49,463 --> 00:10:52,666
so I was unable
to get the CDs,

385
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:55,636
however, I can sing you
a very soothing tune.

386
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:56,938
Something like—

387
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,940
♪ When I get that feeling ♪

388
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:01,308

[alarm blaring]
Oh boy.

390
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:03,644
- What is that?

391
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:04,846
Is there a fire?

392
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,380
- All right, I'm gonna
go check this out.

393
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:07,648
Sharon,
you stay here

394
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:08,983
and prepare to jump
out the window.

395
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,753
That came out weird.

396
00:11:11,753 --> 00:11:14,756
[fire extinguisher hissing]

397
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:19,060
- Guys, what the hell
is going on?

398
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:20,494
- Hitchcock and Scully
saved the day.

399
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,363
- No, you plugged
ten fax machines

400
00:11:22,396 --> 00:11:24,165
into one outlet
and caused a fire.

401
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:25,833
- But I pointed to the fire
extinguisher and was like,

402
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:27,668
"The fire extinguisher's
over there."

403
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,170
- You pointed at
the toaster oven!

404
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:30,938
- You guys, the alarm
is freaking out Sharon.

405
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:32,406
Does anyone know
how to turn it off?

406
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:33,841
- There's an override
switch switch in my office

407
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:34,842
above the thermostat.

408
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:35,910
- Great.
Can you turn it off?

409
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:37,178
- Yes, I'd love
to help out.

410
00:11:37,211 --> 00:11:38,780
Perhaps you'd like me
to wear a bomb suit

411
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,047
with an opaque visor

412
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,349
so Sharon doesn't know
that it is I who—

413
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:44,685
- Just forget it.
I'll do it!

414
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:46,353
Oh, good.
You didn't jump.

415
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:47,955
- What's going on?
Is everything okay?

416
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:49,623
- Yes, I just need to
flick this switch

417
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,893
and turn off
the old alarm-a-roono.

418
00:11:51,926 --> 00:11:53,527
Oh, must've been
the wrong switch.

419
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,595
But this one...

420
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:56,630

And apparently,

424
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,804
does not turn them back off.
[chuckles]

425
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:06,941
- Guys.
What's going on?

426
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:07,975
I thought you were
gonna clear the room?

427
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:09,210
- They won't listen to us.

428
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,311
They're hungry
and pissed

429
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:11,645
and they all hate cops.

430
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:13,547
- Would you guys just fix
the paperwork problem?

431
00:12:13,614 --> 00:12:15,216
I'll take care of this.

432
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:16,450
Excuse me, everyone.

433
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:17,819
Everyone, I'm gonna
need you all

to clear the room.

00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,055
This woman is having
vaginal contractions.

436
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:22,289
- It's just
"contractions,"

437
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:23,724
you don't have to add
"vaginal" to it.

438
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,392
- Oh, sorry.
This woman is having

439
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,128
non-vaginal
contractions.

440
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,395

That was better, right?

443
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,334
Get you down...
- Thank you. Thank you.

Things are about to get

447
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:37,371
very calm in here,
all right?

448
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:38,372
Look at me.

449
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:39,473
You're gonna be
so relaxed,

450
00:12:39,506 --> 00:12:40,674
that baby's gonna
pop right out

451
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:41,843
onto the floor,
you won't even notice.

452
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:43,310
- Don't let my baby
touch the floor!

453
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:44,745
- Right, right!
Because of the filth.

454

00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,215
- I don't know.

00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:49,350
His phone's going
straight to voicemail.

457
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:50,751
Maybe we should go
to the hospital.

458
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,219
- [screaming]
No hospital!

459
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,856
- Yeah,
no hospital, baby.

460
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,591
I will be right back.

461
00:12:57,658 --> 00:12:59,160
Sir?

462
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:00,761
I need your help.

463
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:02,329
- I knew this moment
would come,

464
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:04,065
and I will be
the bigger man.

465
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:05,132
I'd be happy to help.

466
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,133
- Great.

467
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,301
We need a doctor
here immediately.

468
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:08,569
We have to get
your ex-boyfriend.

469
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,071
- I will not help you.

470
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,338
Things did not
end well

471
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:12,773

and me.

00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:14,108

00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,143
- Gina, no.

I can't believe
I'm saying this,

476
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:18,579
but we simply
don't have time

477

to hear about the captain's
sordid romantic past.

You stay here
and take care of Sharon.

What if she's still pregnant
when I get in there?

deal with it.

Frederick right now.

gets tough,

Channing Tatum.

537
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,386
- I'm not talking
to you.

538
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,420
[knocking]

539
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,756
- Please don't slam
the door again.

540
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,392
We have a bit of
a medical situation.

541
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,526
- Well,
I wish I could help,

542
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:14,095
but unfortunately,
I have a bit

543
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:15,762
of a wooden duck
situation.

544
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:17,264
- Excuse me,
what now?

545
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,000
- Still on about
the duck, Frederick?

546
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,002
Years ago,
when we moved in together,

547
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:22,869
an antique duck
decoy of his

548
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:23,870
was misplaced.

549
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:26,007
- It wasn't misplaced.

550
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,741
You threw it
in the trash.

551
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:29,843
And with it,
our relationship.

552
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,412
- Oh, please.

553
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,713
We had other problems.

554
00:15:32,746 --> 00:15:35,416
Or have you
forgotten about...

555
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:36,417
Dave?

556
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,219
- Dave and I
were coworkers

557
00:15:38,252 --> 00:15:39,453
and nothing more.

558
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,455
- Nothing more.
Right?

559
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:42,923
Problem solved,
everybody's friends.

560
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:43,924
Let's go help Sharon.

561
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,559
- I will be happy
to assist you

562
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:47,194
if you will just admit,
Raymond,

563
00:15:47,228 --> 00:15:49,096
that you threw
my decoy in the garbage.

564
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,264
- That will never happen

565
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,532
because it's not true.

566
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:52,566
Thank you for nothing.

567
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:53,934
Good day.

568
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,036
- Hi.

569
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,270
Would you mind
just standing there

570
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,571
with your glorious beard
for one moment?

571
00:15:57,604 --> 00:15:59,573
I'll be right back.

572
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:00,641
What the hell?

573
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:02,043
Just tell him what
he wants to hear.

574
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:03,044
- But it's a lie.

575
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:04,811
- I don't give
a crap, sir.

576
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:06,880
Sharon needs a doctor,
so get over yourself.

577
00:16:06,947 --> 00:16:08,615
Tell him you threw
away his stupid duck,

578
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:10,051
then give him 20 bucks
to buy a new one.

579
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:11,785
- It cost $740.

580
00:16:11,818 --> 00:16:12,786
- What?

581
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:13,787
That is an insane price
for a duck!

582
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,622
That's way too much!

583
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,458
All right, now I'm angry
about the wrong thing.

584
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:20,294
Look, just fix
this for Sharon.

585
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:25,866
- Frederick, the duck
was ugly and gross

586
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,068
and I threw it
in the garbage.

587
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:28,069
- Wow.

588
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:29,070
Well, I know
what I'm thankful

589
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,404
for this Thanksgiving:

590
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:31,472
The truth.

591
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:32,506
[motorcycle rumbling]

592
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:33,840
[intense music]

593
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,842
[cell phone ringing]
- My phone's ringing!

594
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:38,645
Oh—Oh no!
No!

595
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,214
[motorcycle rumbles]

596
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,648
- [sighs]

597
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:43,650
Terry's still not
answering his phone.

598
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:45,819
Why am I the only one
who cares about this baby?

599
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:47,554
- [laughing]

600
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:49,490
- Hey, what took so long?
Is she okay?

601
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,825
- Yeah, I was just telling her
the entire duck story,

602
00:16:51,858 --> 00:16:54,495
now that it finally has
a satisfying ending.

603
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:55,662
No, everything's fine,

604
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:56,730
but I am a little
concerned

605
00:16:56,763 --> 00:16:58,599
about Sharon's
blood pressure.

606
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:00,634
And this is
a terrible environment.

607
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:01,768
- I wouldn't call
it terrible.

608
00:17:01,802 --> 00:17:03,304
- We're surrounded
by criminals,

609
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:04,305
there's no bed,

610
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:05,572
and you can hear
the faint sound

611
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:07,574
of someone screaming
through all the vents.

612
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:08,742
- That's Hitchcock.

613
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:10,911
His arm's stuck
in a pneumatic tube.

614
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:12,579
It's hilarious.
- [chuckling]

615
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:13,847
- In my professional
opinion,

616
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:15,916
Sharon should go
to the hospital.

617
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:16,917
[door opening]

618
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,120
- [heavy breathing]

619
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,321
- Hey.

620
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,856
So the doctor thinks

621
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:24,691
we should go
to the hospital.

622
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:26,026
both: No hospital!

623
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,428
- Yup, I thought
you might say that.

624
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,496
Look, I can't get
a hold of Terry.

625
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,032
- Ugh, that one
was rough.

626
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,601
Oh, maybe I should
listen to the doctor.

627
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:35,702
What do you think?

628
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:37,304
- Sharon, it doesn't
matter what I think.

629
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:38,705
You and the sarge
have a plan.

630
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:40,207
- Yeah, but the plan
changed, like,

631
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:41,942
five horrible
things ago.

632
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:43,277
I'm in a lot of pain.

633
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,612
I mean, I know we said
no hospital, but—

634
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:46,780
I don't want to
risk anything

635
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:49,350
by making
a stupid mistake.

636
00:17:49,383 --> 00:17:50,851
Look, you're my
god-husband.

637
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:53,053
- We both know
that's a fake position.

638
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:55,021
- Not anymore.

639
00:17:55,055 --> 00:17:56,890
What would you do?

640
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:58,192
- [sighs]

641
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:02,196
Where's Sharon?
- Room 41B.

642
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:03,697
- Look, I'm sorry.
I know you said—

643
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,798
- Don't go to
the hospital!

644
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,400
- I tried calling you,
you didn't pick up.

645
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,734
- So you decided to do

646
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:09,936
the exact opposite of the
one thing I told you?

647
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,172
- I thought it was the
right thing to do, Terry.

648
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:12,773
Look, she's in there
with Captain Holt's

649
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:13,774
ex-boyfriend right now,

650
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:15,176
but don't worry,
I made him promise

651
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,877
to stop bringing
up the duck.

652
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,212
- What the hell are
you talking about?

653
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:19,213
- I—
- You know what?

654
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:20,247
I'll deal with
you later.

655
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:21,248
- Seems like you already
dealt with me.

656
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,949
I got the gist,
we're good.

657
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:24,451
- Peralta,

658
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:27,388
can I confess
something to you?

659
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,190
I didn't throw Frederick's
duck in the garbage.

660
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,557
- Yes, I know, sir.

661
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:32,426
- I didn't throw
the duck in the garbage.

662
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,727
I threw it off a bridge.

663
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,598
[funky music]

664
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:38,799
- Why would you do that?

665
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:40,401
- Well, Frederick and
I were having problems.

666
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:41,435
He knew I disliked
the duck

667
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:42,503
because of
its weak beak,

668
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,838
but he insisted on
displaying it anyway.

669
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:45,939
I acted out

670
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:48,209
in a petty manner.

671
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,843
Just as I did today.

672
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,612
I'm sorry that
I wasn't more helpful.

673
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:53,447
- It's fine,
I understand.

674
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,915
You might find this
hard to believe,

675
00:18:54,948 --> 00:18:58,118
but I can be a little childish
sometimes, myself.

676
00:18:58,219 --> 00:18:59,786
- Yes.

677
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,222
You have gum in your
hair right now.

678
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:02,989
- Noted.
- Hey!

679
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,358
- Hey!
You guys came.

680
00:19:04,391 --> 00:19:05,526
What about all
the paperwork?

681
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:06,693
- We got it all in.

682
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:09,696
Filed 900 forms by hand
in under 12 hours.

683
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,897
It was tough,
but worth it.

684
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:12,032
We wouldn't have
missed this.

685
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:13,567
- Also, we had to go
to the ER anyway.

686
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,369
Hitchcock's arm was
mangled by the tube.

687
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:16,870
- I'm in
unspeakable pain.

688
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,539
- Oh.

689
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:20,507
Ugh, this is agonizing.

690
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,376
- It's been
over an hour.

691
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:25,279
This has to be a record
for longest childbirth.

692
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:26,913
- It's a girl!

693
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:29,950
[cheers and applause]

694
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:33,520
- Her name is
Ava Jeffords.

695
00:19:33,554 --> 00:19:35,722
She's 14 pounds,
six ounces.

696
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:36,957
- Whoa.

697
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:38,425
- Oh yeah, Terry Jeffords
makes big babies.

698
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,093
Guys, I just want to say

699
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:41,262
thanks to all of you.

700
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:44,030
Charles and Amy
filling out forms.

701
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:45,932
Rosa,
I'm so thankful

702
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,067
you got me here
on that bike.

703
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,269
- I'm thankful
I could help.

704
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:49,270
- I'm thankful that I'm—

705
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,471
- Boyle, this is
clearly a moment

706
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,638
between him and Diaz.

707
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:53,640
- Captain Holt,
you brought me the doctor

708
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:55,976
that brought my girl
into the world.

709
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,811
And Gina,
I know you got past your fears

710
00:19:57,878 --> 00:19:58,812
and helped Sharon out.

711
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,314
- I'm so happy for you

712
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:01,948
and I never want to see
your daughter

713
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,384
or remember this day.

714
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,051
- And Hitchcock and Scully,

715
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:07,053
I assume you're here
for some unrelated injury.

716
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:08,722
- That's correct.

717
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:09,723
- Jake.

718
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:11,124
Can I see you
for a minute?

719
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:12,626
- Oh. Yeah.

720
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:15,329
- It's a girl.

721
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:17,431
- Ouch! Worth it.

722
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:19,266
- Sharon and I
wanted you to be

723
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,669
the first person
to meet Ava.

724
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:26,473
- Oh, wow.

725
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:29,643
She's beautiful.

726
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:31,578
- I'm sorry I got
angry earlier.

727
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:32,979
You did a great job
today.

728
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:35,682
Hospital was
the right decision.

729
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:38,251
I'm so glad you're
Ava's godfather.

730
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:40,921
I'm so glad you're
Sharon's god-husband.

731
00:20:40,954 --> 00:20:42,956
I'm so glad you're
my god-wife.

732
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,426
I have no idea what
I'm saying at this point.

733
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:48,161
- Thank you, Jake.

734
00:20:48,194 --> 00:20:49,330
- You want to hold her?

735
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:50,831
- Oh, um...

736
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:52,699
Yeah, sure,
that'd be great.

737
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:53,834
- The baby, Jake!

738
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,769
- Yeah!
Right, right, the normal thing.

739
00:20:57,804 --> 00:20:59,506
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
