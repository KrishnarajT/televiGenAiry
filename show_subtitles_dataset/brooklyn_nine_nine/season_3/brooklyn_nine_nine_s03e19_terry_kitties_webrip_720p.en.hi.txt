00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:37,264
is a glowing compliment
in the sewing community.

180
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:38,933
If you wanted to insult me,

181
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,602
you should've called me
a stitch skipper.

Look, I think you might be
overreacting a little

to this prank,
and I should know.

190
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:57,485
You probably won't believe this,
but I was bullied in high school

191
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,986

00:06:00,588 --> 00:06:02,757
It was for setting my crotch
on fire in shop class.

- The reason bullies get to me

198
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,031
is because I lived with one—

199
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:11,332
my dad.

200
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,000
He was a cruel man who
didn't like his life,

201
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:14,168
and he took it out on me.

202

203

Now we're getting somewhere.

204
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,441
If you're having dad problems,

205
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,275
that's my jam, son.

206

- Real weird take on
my crappy father.

207
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:24,546
- You know how I turned
the corner with my dad?

208
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,713
I stood up to him,

209
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:27,515
and that's what you need
to do with your dad.

210
00:06:27,549 --> 00:06:28,950
- No, he died in 1988.

211
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:31,218
- Oh, okay, well, that
probably won't work, then.

212
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:33,020
But it doesn't mean you can't
go over to the 6-5

213
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:34,522

fun of me more.

talking about, Terry?

216
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:38,359
You are a human mountain.

217
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,461
You have more muscles
in your ears

218
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:40,928
than I have in my entire body.

219
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:42,263
- Never skip ear day, Jake.

220
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:43,865
- You can crush metal
with your bare hands.

221
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:45,633
You can lift a city bus.

222
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,702
You can make your boobies
do that bouncy thing.

223
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,637
- They're called pecs.
- Same thing.

224

Now, get on over to the 6-5

225

take back that tiny kitten.

226

All right.

Oh, good morning,

00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:13,528
my sweet, little cuties.

234
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:14,962
- Don't call them cute.

235
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,498
They'd kill us all if
they were smart enough

236
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:18,065
to use weapons,
but you're not smart.

237
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:19,200
You're dumb.

238
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,002
You're always naked,
and you pee in a box.

239
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:22,369
- I suppose they're
not totally naked

with the fur.

241
00:07:24,005 --> 00:07:26,708
Anyways, you know how you didn't
solve that case 20 years ago?

242
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:28,175
- Thanks for reminding me.

243
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:30,411
You don't see me bringing up
how you burned your junk off.

244
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:31,646
- That didn't happen.

245
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:33,080
There was just some
light blistering.

246
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:35,216
The point is,
the only thing those bullies

247
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,885
have over you is that you
never solved that case.

248
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,721
So why don't we
solve it together?

249
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:40,888
- How are we gonna do that?

250
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,389
- We'll sneak into the 6-5,

251
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:43,558
steal that old case file,

252
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,326
and work it till we
find your burglar.

253
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:48,029
Then we march back
into that precinct—

254
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:49,196
- And we grind these kittens up

255
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,565

down their throats!

Whoo, I slept like
a frickin' baby last night.

I know that your spirit animal

- Mm-hmm.
- But mine is the mighty wolf.

287
00:08:46,854 --> 00:08:48,823
And if you want to
beat an alpha,

at being a beta,

00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:53,214
Hurry up and teach us.

355
00:10:53,247 --> 00:11:00,755
♪ ♪

356
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:01,989
- Hey, Slowpoke.

357
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:03,424
When we get out of here,

358
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:05,793
I'm gonna needlepoint you
a pillow that says, "Kapow."

359
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:07,328
- Hey, Amy.
You suck.

360
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:09,731
- Oh, yeah?
Well, guess what?

361
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:10,832
There's more room
on that pillow—

362
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:11,899
- Real quick, before you finish:

363
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:12,834
you still suck.

364
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,268
- Argh!

365
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,137
I'm working so much harder
than you on this trash talk,

366
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,072
and I'm the one whose
feelings are getting hurt.

367
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:19,741
- Santiago, Diaz—
enough.

368
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:21,275
This is not about
who's fastest.

369
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:23,745
This is a bomb
dismantling class.

370
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:26,080
We are police officers,
not street urchins

371
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:28,115
playing speed chess
in the park.

372
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:30,985
For shame.

373
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:32,920
- All right, thanks.

374
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:34,756
Okay, here's what
Esther remembers

375
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:36,123
about the night
that she was robbed.

376
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:37,759
She was either at a restaurant

377
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,526
or the movies
or doing something else.

378
00:11:39,593 --> 00:11:42,096
And she was either
alone or with people.

379
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:43,965
The only thing she was
absolutely sure of

380
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:45,432
is that I seem like
a very nice boy,

381
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:46,768
which is not relevant
to the case,

382
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:47,969
but did make me feel very good.

383
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:49,136
- This is stupid.

384
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,604
It was 20 years ago.

385
00:11:50,637 --> 00:11:52,439
No one remembers anything.

386
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,041
I'm beginning to think
maybe we should—

387
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,276
- Climb out on that ledge

388
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:56,878
and see how the perp got in.

389
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:58,545
- I was gonna say give up.
- What?

390
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,948
Right after I came up with that
incredible ledge thing, Terry?

391
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:02,917
- We're 10 stories up.
You can handle that?

392
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,286
- Sarge, I'm not scared
of heights, okay?

393
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:07,021
I'm scared of bees,
I'm scared of snakes,

394
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:08,956
and I'm scared that the Knicks
might never be good again,

395
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:11,692
but I am not scared of heights.

396
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,961
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

397
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:15,296
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

398
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:17,098
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

399
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:18,132
We're gonna die!

400
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:21,435
I would appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone

401
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:23,070
about my window ledge freak-out.

402
00:12:23,104 --> 00:12:25,206
- That's not as embarrassing as
thinking we could actually solve

403
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,441
a 20-year-old case
with no new leads.

404
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:29,710
- Terry, we are gonna
solve this, all right?

405
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:31,412
Sure, maybe none of the work
we did today

406
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,814
led to any new information.

407
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:33,815
- Jake—

408
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:34,816
- And sure,
most crimes are solved

409
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:35,817
within the first 48 hours,

410
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,084
but they never talk
about the crimes

411
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,719
that are solved within
the first 100 million hours.

412
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,954
- No, look at this.

413
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:43,124
The guy who inspected
this elevator in 1996

414
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:44,491
was named Zerb Gudanya.

415
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:46,093
That's the same weird name

416
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:48,562
who inspected the elevators
in all four of the buildings

417
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:49,931
we've been to today.

418
00:12:49,964 --> 00:12:51,132
- Really?

419
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:52,233
Terry, that's a lead.

420
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,300
We have a lead!

421
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:54,468
- We got a lead!

422
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:55,569
- We got a lead!

423
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:56,637
- We're gonna solve this case.

424
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,839
- We're gonna solve this case.

425
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,006
- I have to use
the bathroom.

426
00:12:59,073 --> 00:13:00,541
- I got to use
the bathroom.

427
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:02,576
I actually don't; I just got
in the rhythm of it.

428
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,682
Pretty fancy car for
an elevator inspector.

429
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:10,417
- The Club International
of Brighton Beach

430
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:12,086
International Club?

431
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:14,388
"International" and "club"
are both in the name twice.

432
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,357
Terry, this place sleazy.

433
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,659
- Two priors,
wealth beyond his means,

434
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,194
and he had access
to the apartments

435
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,362
through the elevator shaft.

436
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:22,864
He has to be our guy.
Let's go.

437
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:25,032
- Okay, I'll say that
I'm a businessman

438
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,901
from Moscow named Ilya.

439
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:30,671
[with accent] "I make millions
from selling snow boots."

440
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:32,739
That was more just to
show off the accent.

441
00:13:32,773 --> 00:13:35,209
I'm not wedded to
the snow boots thing.

442
00:13:35,242 --> 00:13:36,944
- Hey, fellas.

443
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:39,113
You didn't really think that
you could run an operation

444
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,883
in the 6-5 without us
finding out, did you?

445
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,750
There was no yarf.

446
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:45,186
- This guy's good.

447
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:48,055
- Jake, this is Holderton
from my old precinct.

448
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:49,891
- So who are you guys
looking for in there?

449
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:50,958
A Tabby?

450
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,459
Siamese?

451
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:55,196
- First of all, I never said
the cat was a burglar.

452
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:56,630
I said he might
be an accomplice.

453
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:57,698
You know what?

454
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:58,900
I hope the guy in there
is a cat.

455
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,334
That'll show you.

456
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:01,635
- Yeah, if he was a cat,

457
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:02,970
he'd be much easier
to apprehend

458
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:04,438
and probably much
less dangerous.

459
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:05,907
That's what we think.
Let's go.

460
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:11,545
- Okay, I give up.
I need your help.

461
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:13,114
I'm ready to try it your way.

462
00:14:13,147 --> 00:14:15,282
- Shh, you came
at the perfect time.

463
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:17,484
He's eating,
and when an animal eats,

464
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:20,187
that's when they're at
their most vulnerable.

465
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:21,288
You need to get in there—

466
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:22,924
show him who the alpha is.

467
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:24,625
- I need a wolf name.
- Yes.

468
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,660
Virginia Woolf.
- Huh?

469
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:29,030
- Well, I'm not gonna be her
lame husband, Leonard.

470
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:32,066
[sighs]
Okay, it's time, Virginia.

471
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,035
Hey, little man,
let's talk about

472
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:36,837
how much longer you're
gonna stay at my place.

473
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:37,838
[yelps]

474
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:39,040
- Are you threatening me, Chuck?

475
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:40,541
- No, I'm not, sir.

476
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:43,244
I just want to tell you how
welcome you are to stay with me

477
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,579
forever and ever and ever,

478
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:47,949
m'lord.

479
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:49,716
- Ha! Okay.

480
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,817
[laughing]

481
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:51,953
Good, thanks.

482
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:53,955
Next time don't be
so weird about it.

483
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:56,590
- As you wish.
Good day, sir.

484
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:58,092
- That's still weird.

485
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,461
♪

486
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:02,096
- All right, sorry.

487
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:03,097
You don't suck.

488
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,465
- I'm sorry too.

489
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:06,167
We both said hurtful things.

490
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:07,434
- You didn't.
I was fine.

491
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:09,603
- Well, now you're just
lying to yourself.

492
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:11,572
But Holt was right.

493
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:12,974
We should have taken
this more seriously.

494
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:14,641
- [laughing]
Done.

495
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:18,145
Fastest time today by
a full two minutes.

496
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:20,147
Whoo, mama!

497
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:21,515
- Is everything okay over here?

498
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:22,984
- Yes, couldn't be better,

499
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:24,418
because I destroyed you both.

500
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:25,619
- What the hell?

501
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:26,988
I thought you said this
wasn't about winning.

502
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:28,622
- I did say that,
so you would go slower

503
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:30,424
and I would win,
which is what happened.

504
00:15:30,457 --> 00:15:32,293
- You're just as competitive
as we are.

505
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:34,161
- Absurd.
I'm more competitive.

506
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:37,498
Now who's "da bomb"?

507
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,102
- So what did they make you
a sergeant for?

508
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:43,004
Did you arrest a pine cone?

509
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:44,338
- He passed a written test,

510
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,007
just like every
other sergeant did.

511
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:47,174
You knew that.

512
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,475
- Oh, no, I thought he
might have gotten

513
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:49,843
some kind of special promotion

514
00:15:49,876 --> 00:15:51,112
from busting a pine cone.

515
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,146
- Why do you keep
bringing up pine cones?

516
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,147
That's never been
a part of this.

517
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,148
- You know what?

518
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:55,282
You're gonna eat your words,

519
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:57,018
because Sarge is about
to solve this case.

520
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:59,220
- What, the old case
or the pine cone one?

521
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:00,554
- You need to stop.

522
00:16:00,587 --> 00:16:02,723
Look, our man Zerb is
sitting right over there,

523
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:05,226
and yeah, he's connected
to all of the robberies.

524
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:06,460
- And he's shady as hell.

525
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:07,594
Look.

526
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:09,063
Waiter just gave him
a covert signal.

527
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:10,231
Now he's getting up.

528
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:13,400
- Yeah, and now he's
following said waiter

529

to a secondary,

530
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:18,139
most likely even shadier spot.

531
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:19,740
- Something's going on in there.

532
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:21,308
- Huh.
- Yeah, right—huh!

533
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,577
Come on, let's go bust him!
- Come on.

534
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,046
Down, down!
Get down!

535
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,547
NYPD!

536
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,748
- Uh-oh.

537
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:29,250
- What are you doing, man?

538
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:30,817
- Nothing!
I have high cholesterol!

539
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:32,386
My wife says I cannot
have red meat,

540
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,755
so they sneak in my beef stew.

541
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:35,889
Please don't shoot.

542
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,658
- Oh, my God.

543
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,393
It happened again.

544
00:16:39,426 --> 00:16:41,728
Only this guy's
sitting on a toilet

545
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,064
instead of a wheelchair.

546
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:44,565
That's even more dumb.

547
00:16:44,598 --> 00:16:45,799
Here, here, Terry.

548
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,601
Move in closer so I can
get you in the photo.

549
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:53,240
Why are these dicks
out of their cage?

550
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:54,308
- I stayed up all night

551
00:16:54,341 --> 00:16:55,409
working on your case,

552
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:57,278
and Hans, John, and Nakatomi

553
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:58,579
made for great company.

554
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:00,081
I gave them all
"Die Hard" names.

555
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:02,516
- I don't understand why
you wasted another night

556
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:04,585
on a case no one's
ever gonna solve.

557
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:06,353
- Sarge, I am way too
sleep-deprived

558
00:17:06,387 --> 00:17:07,988
to deal with your
negativity right now.

559
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,590
Let me show you what I did.

560
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:11,092
I started off by making a map

561
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:13,594
of all of the burglaries that
have gone down in Brooklyn

562
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,097
since 1996 to see
if there was a pattern.

563
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:19,166
That led me to this.

564
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,102
There is so much crime
in New York.

565
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,669
No one should live here.

566
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:24,905
Anyways, I tripped out
on that for a couple hours,

567
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,507
but I got cheered up

568
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,941
after a took a picture
of the kitties

569
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,110
messing around in
my little hoodie.

570
00:17:29,176 --> 00:17:30,277
I'll show it to you later.

571
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:31,712
- So basically, you wasted
a whole night.

572
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,114
- No, no, no, my friend.

573
00:17:33,114 --> 00:17:35,249
No, no, no, 'cause then
I dove back into your file

574
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:37,784
and found this.

575
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:40,121
- Cool, the low point
of my entire life.

576
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:42,589
- Sarge, this photo
was taken in 1996.

577
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:44,358
You told me your guy
broke his spine

578
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:46,793
two years before that, so '94.

579
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,961
Check out his sneakers.

580
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:51,198
'95 Jordans.

581
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,400
They came out a year
after the accident.

582
00:17:53,434 --> 00:17:55,602
Look at the soles.

583
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:56,603
- They're all muddy.

584
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:57,604
- Which means...

585
00:17:57,638 --> 00:18:00,174
- That son of a bitch can walk!

586
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:01,842
- Bingo.
- Let's go!

587
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,378
- All right.
Cat squad, assemble!

588
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,380
- Leave the cats.
- Okay.

589
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:08,048
- Santiago, Diaz, I wanted
to talk to you

590
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:09,216
about our performance
in yesterday's

591
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,551
bomb defusing course.

592
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:11,718
- We know, sir.
You won.

593
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:14,288
- No, the three of us
all failed.

594
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:15,656
Apparently our instructor felt

595
00:18:15,689 --> 00:18:18,292
we didn't take it
seriously enough.

596
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:19,860
- But Hitchcock
and Scully passed.

597
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:21,162
- What?

598
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:22,963
How did they defuse bombs
better than we did?

599
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:25,232
- Those were bombs?
- Unbelievable.

600
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:27,000
- It's a low moment for us all.

601
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:28,702
I think the lesson here is
that we should not allow

602
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,838
our competitiveness to interfere
with the sanctity of our job.

603
00:18:31,872 --> 00:18:33,574
- Totally agree, sir.

604
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,841
However,

605
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,511
there is a precision driving
class next weekend.

606
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:42,516
- Fastest one around
the track wins.

607
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:43,817
- It's on.

608
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,853
- I'm gonna run you both
off the road into a wall.

609
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:48,389
I'm gonna kill you.

610
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:49,990
- Oh, my.

611
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:51,692
- Hey, Chuck.

612
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:53,327
Will you bring these to
the dry cleaner for me?

613
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,929
Tell them the red stains are
blood and the brown stains are—

614
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:57,364
uh, let's say blood.

615
00:18:57,398 --> 00:18:58,565
- Well, sure.

616
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,033
Don't even bother
putting them in a bag.

617
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:01,635
I'll just carry them in my arms.

618
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:02,903

619

Beard-o.

620
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,973
It's time for you to get out
of Charles's house today.

621
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,409
- Hang on, ma'am.

622
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:09,643
You don't tell me
what to do.

623
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:11,845
- Uh, that's where
you're wrong, baby girl.

Go to sleep.
- Okay.

intimidate me?

with garden shears

631

as a loyalty test.

I've been through hell.

633
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:27,461
- Big deal.

634
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:30,531
I worked an a sunglass kiosk
at the mall for four years.

635
00:19:30,597 --> 00:19:32,933
So not only have I
been through hell,

636
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:34,935
I was assistant manager there.

637
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,102
- Hmm.

638
00:19:36,136 --> 00:19:37,671
- You're gonna get out
of Chuckie's house.

639
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:39,105
And what's more,

640

you're gonna pay him rent
for the night you spent there.

That's not what happened.
