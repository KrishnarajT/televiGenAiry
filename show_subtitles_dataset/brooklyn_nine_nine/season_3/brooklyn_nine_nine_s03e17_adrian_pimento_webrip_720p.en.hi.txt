something over here?
- Sure thing, bud.

Genevieve a sexy pic.

Does this make
my bubble butt pop?

00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:07,072
- Nope.
I'm out.

Think you're at my desk.

Drop the weapon!

- Don't be a dum-dum.

11
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:22,720
- Squad, meet
Detective Adrian Pimento.

12
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:24,656
He's been deep undercover
for the last 12 years,

13
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:28,126
but he's just resurfaced, and
he's rejoining the Nine-Nine.

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,728

15
00:00:30,762 --> 00:00:32,230

- Some of you just met
Detective Pimento,

19
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:56,688
and, of course, some of you knew
him before he went undercover.

20
00:00:56,754 --> 00:01:00,225
- Hitchcock and Scully. Ha.
You guys still work here?

21
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:02,994
- The only way they're getting
rid of us is in a body bag.

22
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:05,763
- It actually happened once,
but it was a false alarm.

23
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,233
- Detective Pimento will be
returning to his old desk.

27
00:01:12,737 --> 00:01:14,172
- I worked for
Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis.

28
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:16,841
- That is an A-list mobster.
Tell me literally everything.

Everyone, shut up!

30
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,345

a bagman for him.

funnier little stories.

funny about what I did

for The Butcher.

37
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:36,961
I've had to learn
not to blink,

your eyes moist?

41
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:43,268

42

Pimento on my B&E?

That guy is awesome.

He's like a real life
Donnie Brasco.

sad movie that ends terribly?

- Yeah, but he's got
that cool jacket,

down at the docks.

you working with Pimento.

You probably forgot.

Just make sure
you take it easy.

I don't think you need to

to welcome Pimento
to the Nine-Nine.

been in my house, yep.

Now, this just needs to cook for
another 11 hours, 32 minutes,

How dare you try

- So where do we go from here?

117
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:18,923

you know the old saying,

118
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:22,294
"The only way to unclog a toilet
is to let it sit."

119
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,296
- You're a janitor.
You should know that's not true.

120

121

So you will do it?

Oh!

I only fly first class.

- I'm not flying you anywhere.

131

I made an application to
the M.C. Guffin Foundation

132
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:46,651
for a grant to upgrade
our office equipment.

133
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:49,487
Unfortunately, they require
a video submission.

I understand you have
some filmmaking experience.

135
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:54,158

re-Vined by Rob Kardashian,

00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:56,093

of the precinct

Detective Diaz and me.

You're not our most dynamic
screen presences.

- Sentences.

- Please, don't interrupt me.

150
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:23,855
That kind of nonsense
won't happen on camera.

151
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,423

This is my desk, okay?

that's out of the way,

I was just coming to let you
know we're gonna work

156
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:35,433
a B&E together;
we're gonna be partners.

157
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,402
- Nope.
I work alone.

158
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,571
Plus, The Butcher says
he has spies in the NYPD,

159
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:41,773
so I trust
none of these dildos.

160
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:43,641
- Listen, you can trust me.

161
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,743
I'm, like, obsessed with you.
- [scoffs] Fine.

162
00:05:45,777 --> 00:05:48,580
Tell me something you've never
told another living soul.

163
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:49,881
- Um...

164
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:51,383
Ooh, here's one.

165
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:54,085
I'm actually not strong enough
to lift a water cooler jug,

166
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:55,587
so I always find a way
to make Terry do it.

167
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,954
- Here's mine.

168
00:05:56,988 --> 00:05:58,456
Jimmy "The Butcher" made me
drive a croquet wicket

169
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,626
through a guy's eyes
into his brain.

170
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:04,829
Brain leaked out his eyes
like he was crying his own mind.

171
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:06,464
- My goodness.

172
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:07,865
Now that I've heard yours,

173
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,701
I feel like
my water cooler thing

174
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,202
could have been
a little more juicy, but...

175
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,971
- No.
That was embarrassing for you.

176
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,407
A bond has been made.

177
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,876
Feels good to trust again,
brother.

178
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,845
- Wow, either you are a cyborg

179
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:23,815
or you're carrying
so many weapons in this jacket.

180
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,317
- Hey.
Kitchen, now.

181
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:27,419
- Okay.

182
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,586
What's up?

183
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:30,154
- Something's not right
about that guy.

184
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:32,023
- Why, just because he keeps
threatening to kill me

185
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:34,225
in the middle of a police
precinct? Uh, grow up.

186
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:35,660
- Because I'm physically
attracted to him.

187
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,261
- And that's bad?

188
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:39,263
- I'm only attracted to creeps:
the Vulture, the ShamWow guy,

189
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,665
and when I was a kid,

190
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:42,199
I had a major crush
on the evil Gremlin.

191
00:06:42,233 --> 00:06:43,935
- Stripe?
Are you crazy?

192
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,437
- Yeah, well I'm not
gonna bone Gizmo.

193
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:47,505
- I would.
- Careful with Pimento.

194
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:49,941
- It's gonna be fine.

195
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:54,679
- Hey, partner.

196
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:56,714
- Oh!
- I've been waiting for you.

197
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:57,749
[chuckles]

198
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:04,622
It's just when I was undercover,
the middle of the night

199
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,090
was the only time
I could do actual police work.

200
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:07,625
- Uh, how'd you get
in the apartment?

201
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:08,926
- Oh, it was easy.

202
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,462
I just seduced
the old lady upstairs,

203
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,297
came down the fire escape,
jimmied the window open.

204
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,933
Bing-bang-boom, I'm inside
your living quarters.

205
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,469
- Totally.

206
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,937
Course, next time you could just
give me a call, you know.

207
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,473
Two ways to pop in on a friend.

208
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:22,574
- I didn't kill
the old lady upstairs,

209
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:23,775
if that's what
you're worried about.

210
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:25,109
- Well, I am now.

211
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:26,478
- Oh, wait a minute.

212
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,480
You think I'm being weird.

213
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,582
Oh, I shouldn't have come here.
This is your apartment.

214
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:34,486
I'm so sorry, Jake!
Stupid, Paul!

215
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,253
Stupid!
You idiot, Paul!

216
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:37,822
- Hey! Pimento!
- Huh?

217
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,157
- Who's Paul?
- Whoa.

218
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:41,893
Paul Sneed
was my undercover name.

219
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:43,394
'Kay?
Damn it, Jake.

220
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:44,796
I don't know who I am
anymore.

221
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:46,498
- You could have chose
any name to go undercover,

222
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:47,499
and you picked Paul Sneed?

223
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,500
Seems kind of crazy.

224
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,501
- I shouldn't have come here.

225
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:50,968
This was a mistake.
I'm not ready.

226
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,505
I knew I wasn't ready
to go back to being police.

227
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:55,640
It's the only job I've ever had
except for bagging groceries

228
00:07:55,673 --> 00:07:58,309
at the supermarket at the corner
of Atlantic and Clinton.

229
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,411
I guess I could go back
to that again.

230
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:01,846
"Paper or plastic?"

231
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,247
Yeah, still got it.

232
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:05,149
- Listen to me,
I was undercover.

233
00:08:05,182 --> 00:08:08,753
63 days with the Mafia.
I saw some messed-up stuff.

234
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,755
I know what your struggle is.

235
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:14,726
And I can bring you home,
but you've got to trust me.

236
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,194
- Okay. Yeah.

237
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,864
- Great. Now, I've got
to get some sleep.

238
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:22,333
You're welcome to stay here
and work the case if you want.

239
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,367
- Thanks, partner.

240
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,070
I promise I won't
disturb you at all.

241
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:30,207
Whuuuhhhh.

242
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:33,210
Whuuuhhhh.

243
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:34,846
- Hey, Pimento.
- Huh?

244
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,681
- I thought you were just gonna
be looking through the files

245
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:37,915
or something, man.
- Sorry, brother.

246
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:40,017
Tai chi helps
keep the demons at bay.

247
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,352
- Right.

248
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:43,254
And...

249
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:44,556
Do you have to do it
in your underwear?

250
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:46,090
- I can't take them off,

251
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:48,860
'cause then you'd be looking
right at my penis and testicles.

252
00:08:48,893 --> 00:08:51,729
- Can't argue with that logic.
Mm-kay.

253
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,568
- Why is there
so much garbage in here?

254
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,903
- [sighs] Mean Marge
won't clean up the stew.

255
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:01,472
And also, she suspended
our trash service.

256
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,774
- What happened?

257
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,576
You didn't grovel enough,
did you?

258
00:09:04,576 --> 00:09:07,178
- Seriously, Amy,
you're gonna ask Charles Boyle

259
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:09,346
if he groveled enough?
Come on!

260
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,982
- This is the grossest thing
I've ever seen,

261
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:12,684
and I have three kids
under the age of four.

262
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,285
I live in a house of fluids.

263
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,020
- Look, I have a plan, okay?

264
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:17,889
We're just gonna go over
Mean Marge's head

265
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:18,890
and we're gonna tell Holt.

266
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:20,124
- Tell me what?

267
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,593
- Oh, well, I don't know
if you noticed,

268
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,595
but there was an accident
in the break room yesterday.

269
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:27,064
- Oh, yes, shattered windows,
bones everywhere.

270
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:29,834
It's very "New York in the 70s."
Clean it up.

271
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,069
- The, uh, problem...

272
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:35,472
is Marge in facilities
is refusing to help.

273
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:37,909
- We were actually hoping
maybe you could ask her.

274
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:38,910
- Excuse me?

275
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:40,812
I'm the captain
of this precinct.

276
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:43,648
I don't have time to mediate
your petty squabbles.

277
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,684
I've taken a sacred oath
to protect this community,

278
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:49,320
and that is a job
I take seriously.

279
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:50,688
- So you're afraid of her, too,
huh?

280
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,823
- Terrified.

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,929
- Yeah, perp knew
where the camera was.

282
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:59,396
Must have cased the joint
ahead of time.

283
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,232
We're gonna need all your
footage from the past week.

284
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:04,001
- Ha-ha-ha.
This is an amateur job.

285
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,737
Everybody knows you break in
when the owner's there.

286
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,538
That way you have guaranteed
access to the safe,

287
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:09,440
and you can kick his teeth in
to send a message.

288
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,075
- Okay, why don't you just...

289
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,610
- Oh, sure, you could
slit his throat, but then

290
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:13,945
what are you going to do
with all the blood?

291
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,413
- Uh, we'd leave it in his body,
where blood lives,

292
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,715
because we're cops.

293
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:19,951
- Oh, right, we're cops.
And don't worry, sir.

294
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:21,753
We're gonna
catch these bastards,

295
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:24,421
or my name isn't Paul Sneed.
- Adrian Pimento.

296
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,758
- Adrian Pimento.
So, what'd they take?

297
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,760
- About $15,000 worth of stuff.

298
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:31,696
TVs, cameras,
bunch of pre-paid cell phones.

299
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,530
- Ooh, you sell burner phones?

300
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,266
What kind of deals
you got on those?

301
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,467
- Why do you want
to know about the deals?

302
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,736
- Just gathering evidence
for the case,

303
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,271
'cause I'm a cop, remember?

304
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:42,774
Detective Paul Sneed.
- Adrian Pimento.

305
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:46,811
- Adrian Piment—I—I know who I
am—you know what—forget this!

306
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:47,812
- Ah—okay.

307
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,947
- [grunting]

308
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:52,717
- Hey, hey, hey, come on, man.

309
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,720
Look, I get it...
you're still tense.

310
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:57,421
When I came back
from being undercover,

311
00:10:57,454 --> 00:10:58,923
they made me see a shrink.

312
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:00,858
But then he told me I had
dad issues, and I was like,

313
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:02,326
"You know what,
you can't tell me what to do,

314
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,295
you're not my dad,"
so he was a moron.

315
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,197
- No, you know what, that's good
advice—thanks, man, thanks.

316
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,332
I—I'll be right back,
I just left something inside.

317
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,004
Hey, give me one of those.

318
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:16,407
- Why are you buying
a burner phone?

319
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:18,242
- Cue smoke machine.

320
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,812
And... action Holt.

321
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:25,516
- Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
I'm Captain Raymond Holt.

322
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:27,719
- And I'm
Detective Rosa Diaz.

323
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,721
I don't understand why
I'm on a wheelchair.

324
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,222
- Cut!

325
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:34,726
For the last time, Rosa, through
the magic of special effects,

326
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:37,161
the wheelchair
will turn into a horse,

327
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:39,230
but I need you to work with me.

328
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,365
Give me a little "hee-yah!"
Hee-yah!

329
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:42,734
- This is idiotic.

330
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:44,769
- Maybe because you didn't
karate chop your way

331
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:46,904
through the smoke, as scripted.

332
00:11:46,938 --> 00:11:48,072
- I'm out.
Scully.

333
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:49,340
- Rosa!

334
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,408
- Hee-yah, hee-yah.

335
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:52,744
- I wanted a simple,
straightforward

336
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,045
video tour of the precinct,

337
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:56,748
and you've added the one
ingredient I didn't want:

338
00:11:56,748 --> 00:11:57,749
pizzazz.

339
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,251
- Pizzazz is who I am.

340
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:03,187
Would you tell the sky
to stop being so blue?

341
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,922
- Yes. I wish it were tan.
- What?

342
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,258
- It's my favorite color.
It's no-nonsense.

343
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,293
- Hey, I've been
tailing Pimento,

344
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,762
and I think you were right.

345
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:12,363
There's something weird
going on with that guy.

346
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:13,931
- I knew it. Ugh!

347
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,599
I can't believe
I'm gonna sleep with him.

348
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:17,869
- Well, you don't have to.

349
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,170
- No, I'm gonna.

350
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:21,205
- He secretly
bought a burner phone,

351
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:22,473
he broke into my apartment

352
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:23,841
and he keeps forgetting
he's a cop

353
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:25,777
and calling himself
by his alias, Paul Sneed.

354
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,044
- Paul Sneed?

355
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:28,946
- He said Figgis has spies
in the NYPD.

356
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,515
Rosa, what if he's one of them?
What if he turned?

357
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,450
Oh, here he comes.

358
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:35,787
Oh, man, bolt cutters?

359
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:37,021
Bolt cutters have literally

360
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:38,555
never been used by
an innocent person.

361
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:39,991
- I use them all the time
when I make jewelry.

362
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,492
- What?
Oh, my God.

363
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:42,794
Follow-up questions later.

364
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:43,961
All right, I got to
keep following him.

365
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,496
- All right, but be careful.

366
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,165
- Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll be invisible.

367
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:50,201
Now you see me, now you—
[car engine revs]

368
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:52,203
♪ 'Cause here's my number ♪
- Ah—

369
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:53,537
♪ So call me maybe ♪

370
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,873
[music stops]
- We're cool, we're cool.

371
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:57,842
Everything's still cool.
He didn't hear me, we're cool.

372
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:06,117
[phone pad beeps]

373
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:08,119
- Rosa.

374
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:09,420
Pimento just put on a ski mask

375
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,388
and broke into a creepy
abandoned warehouse.

376
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:12,389
- Mm, that's hot.

377
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:13,825
- It is?

378
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:14,959
Oh, wait, he's coming back out.

379
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:16,560
- Did he do something
super shady?

380
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:17,661
Are his eyes all wild?

381
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,396
- Rosa, focus.
- Sorry.

382
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,965
Send a pic. Bye.

383
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:22,834
- Okay,
guess we're done talking.

384
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:28,105
- Well, they still haven't
cleaned up in there,

385
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,674
but the good news is
I got a new plan.

386
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:33,310
I let one of the perps
accidentally get out of holding,

387
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:35,612
then I take him down
to the break room.

388
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,949
Oopsie.
Now it's a whole crime scene.

389
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,117
- [gasps] And then we can get
crime scene cleaners.

390
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,153
- Boom.
- Not so fast.

391
00:13:42,186 --> 00:13:44,488
That room gets clean
when I say it gets cleaned.

392
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:46,290
- You can't stop us now.

393
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:48,125
- You ever heard
the old saying,

394
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,661
"Know the garbage,
know the man?"

395
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:51,762
- That's not a saying.

396
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:55,032
- Yes, it is.
I know all your secrets.

397
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,533
[snaps fingers]
Boyle.

398
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,269
You got a taste for fast food.

399
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:00,037
- [giggles]
Those aren't mine.

400
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,705
I only eat
locally-sourced meats.

401
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,207
They could be Terry's.
He was fat once, you know?

402
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,675
- What the hell, Boyle?

403
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,877
- Speaking of Jeffords,

404
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,544
maybe your daughters
would like to know

405
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,281
that their daddy throws away
all their drawings?

406
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:12,683
- They just draw so many,
and they're all so bad.

407
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:14,685
- And you, Santiago,

408
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:16,888
maybe the world would like to
see that draft of a memo

409
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:20,791
you wrote where you used
T-H-E-I-R instead of T-H-E-R-E?

410
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:22,693
- Oh, you sick son of a bitch.

411
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:24,028
- Why do you hate us
so much?

412
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:26,097
- I know you call me
Mean Marge.

413
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,899
Do you even know my last name?

414
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,300
Hmm?

415
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:32,203
- Mop-Bucket?
- Scully, don't guess.

416
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:33,370
Please.
- No.

417
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:34,805
- Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

418
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,909
- "Mop-Bucket," Scully?

419
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,443
- It was a educated guess.

420
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:42,947
- Thanks for coming.

421
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,082
Pimento put the duffel in his
trunk, parked around the corner,

422
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:46,783
and went home; he's been doing
shirtless tai chi

423
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:47,784
in his window ever since.

424
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,220
- Which window is that?

425
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,291
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

426
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,592
Look, I got to
get into that trunk.

427
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,128
- And you need me
to break into the car for you?

428
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,129
- What?
No, I can do it.

429
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,730
Why would you say that?

430
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:01,999
- Because one time you lost your
keys and you called a tow truck.

431
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,935
- My mom pays for
roadside assistance.

432
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:07,238
Why wouldn't I call it?
I'm doing this.

433
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:13,744
- Okay, great take!
You guys are finally getting it.

434
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,314
All right, let's go again.
Action Holt!

435
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:19,750
- [rhythmic blowing]

436
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:23,254
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
I'm Captain Raymond Holt.

437
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,390
- And I'm Detective Rosa Diaz.
Hee-yah.

438
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:27,959
- The hell is this?

439
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,962
- You had a pizzazz problem,
so you've been recast, sweetie.

440
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:32,363
Welcome to Hollywood.

441
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,166
You know, David here
really connected with the role.

442
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,734
- The key is to invent
a backstory for your character.

443
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:41,505
Now, my Raymond Holt is addicted
to pills, but no one knows.

444
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:45,209
- You see, he really
understands the craft,

445
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:48,379
whereas you and Rosa just sort
of flop around

446
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:50,381
like a couple
of boring normals.

447
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,016
- I'm sorry,
but we're detectives,

448
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:53,784
not professional actors.

449
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,086
We were trying our hardest.

450
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,254
- "We were trying our hardest."
- Stop it.

451
00:15:57,288 --> 00:16:00,824
- Gina, this is a disgrace.
I'm removing you as director.

452
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,260
- There he goes.

453
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:04,996
[whispering]
Off to take more pills.

454
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,331
- Oh, yeah.

455
00:16:07,364 --> 00:16:09,700
Suck it, roadside assistance.

456
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:11,102
- Well, well, well.

457
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:12,503
Hello, Jake.

458
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:15,006
- Adrian, what a coincidence
bumping into you here.

459
00:16:15,006 --> 00:16:16,007
Well, see you tomorrow.

460
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,174
[gun cocks]

461
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,309
You know what,
let's hang out now.

462
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,476
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

463
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,045
[laughs]

464
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:22,213
- What are you doing here,
partner?

465
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,214
- Pimento's still in the window.

466
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,648
- Come on, Jake.

467
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:26,850
You honestly didn't assume
I would hire a look-alike

468
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:29,186
to wear a fake beard
and do tai chi in my window?

469
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,022
- No, I definitely
didn't assume that.

470
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:32,723
- And plus, you seriously
thought that was me?

471
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:34,325
I mean, you've seen me
in my underpants.

472
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:36,160
My butt is rock hard.

473
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:37,661
That guy's got
a pancake butt.

474
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:39,363
- I can't believe you're still
working for Figgis.

475
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:40,831
That's why you've been
acting so weird.

476
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:42,533
Breaking into my apartment,
buying a burner phone,

477
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,168
grabbing this duffel.

478
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,836
- I broke into your apartment
'cause I didn't feel safe

479
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:47,304
at my home.
- Okay.

480
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,040
- And a burner phone is
the only kind of phone I can get

481
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,641
because I disappeared
for 12 years,

482
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:52,709
and now have terrible credit.
- Makes sense.

483
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:54,578
- You want to know
what's in the duffel?

484
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,313
Open it up, tough guy.

485
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,082
- [sighs]

486
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,151
- Oh, look at that.

487
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:03,587
A bunch of old family photos
and personal belongings.

488
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,056
- Pimento's mementos.

489
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,157
I know you have a gun on me.

490
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:08,225
I just couldn't
resist the rhyme, sorry.

491
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:10,161
- I stashed it all
when I became Paul Sneed.

492
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:11,828
I couldn't have them
finding anything

493
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:13,064
that could
trace back to my family.

494
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:14,431
- I get it, all right?

495
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,167
I went through the exact
same thing when I came back—

496
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:19,103
- You have no clue
what I've been through!

497
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:21,405
You know what?

498
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,240
I can't believe
I trusted you.

499
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:25,909
- Okay.

500
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:28,145
- Just get out of here, Jake.

501
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:30,147
- Oh, my God, this guy's
got a pancake butt.

502
00:17:30,181 --> 00:17:32,416
It's not Pimento.
Get out of there, Jake!

503
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:33,817
- Thanks, Rosa.

504
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:39,923
Any idea why?

505
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:41,492
- Oh, yeah, I straight up
drove him off.

506
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,327
Big screw-up on my part.

507
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,262
I'm trying this new thing
where I just own my mistakes.

508
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:46,830
I like it. Do you?
- I did.

509
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:48,632
Until you bragged about it.
- Yeah.

510
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:49,966
- Pimento left his gun
and badge on my desk,

511
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,436
along with a note reading,
"I can't do this.

512
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:54,205
I'm better off as a bagman."

513
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,506
- Oh, no.

514
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:57,108
- You think he went back
to work with Figgis?

515
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:58,109
- Worse.

516
00:17:58,142 --> 00:17:59,810
- Fine, single bag it.

517
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:02,113
It's your funeral,
you dumb son of a bitch.

518
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,381
Get out of here.

519
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,416
Idiot.

520
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:07,684
- Hey, partner.

521
00:18:07,718 --> 00:18:09,120
- Bag boys don't have partners.

522
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,354
- Actually,
cashiers and bag boys

523
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:11,722
need to be totally in sync—

524
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:13,257
- Shut up, Maggie.

525
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,526
- Look, man, you sacrificed
12 years of your life

526
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,694
for the police department;
you're a hero.

527
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:19,696
I'm sorry that
I didn't trust you.

528
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,865
- Yeah. Me too.

529
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:25,536
- Look, can I tell you something
I've never told anyone before?

530
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:29,906
My time undercover in the Mafia
was actually kind of lame.

531
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,143
I mean, I wanted it
to be badass,

532
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,977
but I'm good at computers,
so I mostly just helped them

533
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:35,312
switch over from AOL.

534
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:38,449
I have no idea
what you're going through.

535
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:41,318
And I want to tell you that it's
all gonna go back to normal,

536
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:43,287
but honestly, I have no clue.

537
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:47,891
Anyways, the footage came back
on that B&E,

538
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:49,426
and we've got a suspect.

539
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,795
I'm going to bust him right now
if you want to come with me.

540
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:55,466
- Why don't you
give me those eggs?

541
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:56,733
I'll put them on top here.

542
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:59,670
- Okay.

543
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,538
- What was that about?
What happened to you?

544
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:02,906
- Maggie, butt out!

545
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:04,908
Okay?
This is my life!

546
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:06,310
- So I just received word

547
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:08,078
from our friend
at the Guffin Foundation.

548
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:10,481
Apparently they loved
our video submission.

549
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:11,915
What did you send them?

550
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:14,084
- A cinematic masterpiece
is what I sent them.

551
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:15,552
- Did it feature pizzazz?

552
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:17,421
- No, none at all, sir.

553
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:19,856
First, I couldn't wrap my head
around that concept,

554
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,392
but then I realized:

555
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,760
do you know which dogs get
the most likes on the internet?

556
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,329
- Anatolian Shepherds.

557
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:27,764
- No, ugly little runts

558
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:31,768
with wonky eyes and tongues that
won't stay in their mouths.

559
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:33,103
- But the Anatolian Shepherd

560
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:34,605
is unrivaled
for protecting livestock.

561
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:36,340
- I was trying to wow them,

562
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:40,244
and I should have just been
showcasing our wonk-eye.

563
00:19:40,277 --> 00:19:41,745
♪ I will remember you ♪

564
00:19:41,778 --> 00:19:44,881
- We were trying our hardest,
but this is a disgrace.

565
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:47,050
[echoing]
Disgrace, disgrace.

566
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,019
Help us.
Stop it.

567
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:54,291
- And that's real audio of
your very-real diva meltdown.

568
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,394
You might just make it
as an actor after all.

569
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:58,695
- Well done, Linetti.

570
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:59,796
- Sergeant Linetti.

571
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:02,032
I had the fake Holt
give me a promotion.

572
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:03,967
He signed the papers
and everything.

573
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:06,870
- What do you want?

574
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:09,440
- To tell you that we will
officially be renaming

575
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:15,045
the fourth-floor break room
"The Marge Bronigan Break Room."

576
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:16,380
- Well.

577
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:17,781
Looks like somebody
did their homework.

578
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:19,316
- It was me.
I did it.

579
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:20,317
- So what's the catch?

580
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,419
- The ceremony
starts in two hours.

581
00:20:22,453 --> 00:20:25,256
Now, I know our squad
is not in the janitor's union,

582
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,923
but it'd sure be nice
if we were allowed

583
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:29,293
to clean the place up
before then.

584
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:32,496
We cleaned up the stew,

585
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:38,001
which means the Marge Bronigan
Break Room is open for business!

586
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:41,104
- Okay, we'll take out your
trash, do normal cleaning,

587
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,439
but no big messes.

588
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:44,441
- Great!
Time for the christening.

589
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:45,742
[pop]
[glass shatters]

590
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:47,944
[overlapping chatter, commotion]

591
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:49,846
- Oh, crap.

592
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,014
[all gasp, shout]

593
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,586
Congratulations.

594
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,755
- Perp is on the third floor.
Everyone know your assignment?

595
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:00,090
- Mind if I tag along?

596
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,492
- Pimento?

597
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:02,659
- I thought about it.

598
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,328
If you say things
will get back to normal,

599
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:06,830
then I trust you.

600
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:08,299
- All right.

601
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:09,300
Let's do this.

602
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,902
You're with me, partner.

603
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:14,170
[guns cock]
NYPD! You're under arrest!

604
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:15,906
- You're gonna die!

605
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:17,674
- No, Pimento!
No!

606
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,676
- Not a doctor.
Shh.

607
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,077
- Fremulon.
