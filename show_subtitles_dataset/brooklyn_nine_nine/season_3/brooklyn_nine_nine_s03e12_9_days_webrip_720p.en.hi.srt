00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,935
- Morning, everyone.

2
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:05,336
- Morning, sir.

3
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:06,704
Hey, look.

4
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:08,706
We're food stain buds.

5
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:10,475
Who are you wearing?
Porridge?

6
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:12,209
- Um,

7
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:14,378
oatmeal.

8
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:15,513
- Hmm.

9
00:00:15,547 --> 00:00:17,181
- Oh, my God.

10
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:18,349
He didn't even wipe it off.

11
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:20,017
- He's totally given up
on life.

12
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:21,453
- It's loneliness.

13
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:23,387
Ever since Kevin left
for his sabbatical in Paris,

14
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:24,822
he hasn't been the same.

15
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:26,491
- I tried to get him
out of the house.

16
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:28,826
I invited him to bar trivia,
but he turned me down,

17
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,962
not that Trivia Newton John
needed the help.

18
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,329
We're nationally ranked.
It's no big deal.

19
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:33,731
- You're right, it's not.

20
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:35,399
- Well, aren't you all
just a bunch

21
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:37,502
of big-hearted dum-dums.

22
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:39,370
You want to make him feel
less lonely?

23
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,905
This is how you do it.

24
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:43,207
- A case file?
- Yeah, dude loves work.

25
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,976
- I thought all your
cases were closed.

26
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:46,377
You were bragging about it
so much last night,

27
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,012
I couldn't hear the end
of the neighbors' fight.

28
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,413
- It ended in sex.
It always does.

29
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:50,515
It didn't make me horny.

30
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:52,650
It's a cold case
from my first year

00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:53,651
as a detective.

32
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,052
- Is it active again?

33
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:56,353
- No, but Holt doesn't
have to know that.

34
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:57,822
- So you're gonna lie to him?

35
00:00:57,855 --> 00:01:00,492
- No, I'm going to make him
forget about his sadness

36
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:02,760
through the power of...

37
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:04,128
distraction!

38
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,399

Ah, hola, mi capitan.

00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:32,790
Why am I speaking Italian,
you might ask?

43
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:33,858
- That was Spanish.

44
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:35,527
- Yeah, there are too many
languages.

45
00:01:35,527 --> 00:01:37,695
An old case of mine
is starting to heat up,

46

and I'd like your old help

- Still Spanish.
- Right.

48
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,370
Joey Garibaldi was a mafia
lieutenant.

49
00:01:46,437 --> 00:01:48,439
About eight years ago,
I was closing in on him

50
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,541
when he disappeared.

51
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:52,544
But now I'm hearing chatter
on the street

52
00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:54,311
that he's back in town.

53
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,548
Will you help me?

54
00:01:56,614 --> 00:01:59,383
- Hmm, sounds interesting.
Count me in.

00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:01,285
- Yes!
Thank you very much, sir.

56
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,788
Uh, good-a bye-a.

57
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,056
Italian.

58
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,259
- Ooh, standardized tests?

59
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,794
I have a great trick.

They're kicking my butt.

64
00:02:18,636 --> 00:02:20,437
I can't get better
than 70%.

65
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:22,239
- C-minus,
the perfect grade—

but you're still hot.

- Captain Holt gave me his test
to help me study.

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,715
Look at what the grader
wrote on his essay.

"Thank you for writing this.

Reading it made me
a better man."

I'll never be as good a leader
as Holt.

- You need to stop
focusing on tests.

There's more to life than scores
and book learning, okay?

74

Look at me, I've had no
official dance training.

75
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:48,600
Yet here I stand...

76
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,934
a miracle of movement.

- Hey, you guys seen Boyle?

78

- Yep, he's in a little ball
under his desk.

79
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:01,813
- Oh, no.

80
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:03,214
Did you watch "Grimm"
again last night?

81
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:04,649
You know it gives you
nightmares.

82
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:05,717
- I'm sad.

83
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,619
Jason died this morning.

84
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:08,653
- I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

85
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:09,887
Is he a friend of yours?

86
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:11,088
- He was my dog.

87
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:12,356
- Oh, okay,
so no big deal then.

88
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:13,658
- No, it is to me.

89
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,493
But don't worry,

90
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:18,529
I'll find a way
to power through.

91
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:22,667
Oh, God.

92
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,368
This is how Jason
saw the world.

93
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,037
- Wait, was this your dog
that humped everything?

94
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,404
- Yeah, that's how he died.

95
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:29,440
He was going to town
on one of my snow boots,

96
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:31,643
and his little heart
just gave out.

97
00:03:31,643 --> 00:03:33,510
He didn't even finish.
- Gross.

98
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:36,513
Anyway, we have to work
a stream of B&E's on 4th Street.

99
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:37,649
It's time for you to move on.

100
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:38,683
It's what Jackson
would've wanted.

101
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:40,652
- Jason!
- Whatever, little buddy.

102
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:44,521
- Captain, thank you
for meeting me.

103
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:45,957
Sorry to make you work
on a Saturday.

104
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:47,224
- No, nonsense, I was free.

105
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:48,359
Kevin is still in Paris.

106
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:49,393
- Is he?

107
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,228
Wow, I totally forgot
about that.

108
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,430
Any-hoops, this is all
the stuff that we got

109
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,700
from Garibaldi's apartment
after he disappeared.

110
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,534
Tell me what you see.

111
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,971
- This man is in every
photograph.

112
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:01,372
- Nick DiTullio.

113
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:02,774
I actually brought him in
eight years ago,

114
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:03,975
but he refused to talk.

115
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:05,677
Of course, you know the saying,

116
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,445
"time shall open up the mouth
of every man

117
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,847
to the truth of his neighbor."

118
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,548
All right, it's a real saying.
Let's not dwell on it.

119
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:12,850
The point is, he's definitely
gonna tell us

120
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:14,118
where Garibaldi is.

121
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,220
- I don't know where
Garibaldi is, all right?

122
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:17,521
It's not like we were close.

123
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:19,023
I was just his trainer
at the gym.

124
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:20,692
- Then why were you always
going out to dinner with him?

125
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,695
Was he doing reps of linguine?
- Noice.

126
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:25,897
- Look, you don't say no
to Garibaldi, all right?

127
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:27,799
That's why I always let him
work his chest and his abs

128
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:28,800
and never his legs.

129
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,734
- Yeah, the key is balance.

130
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,568
That's why I never
work any of it.

131
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:32,970
- Unless you guys are gonna
arrest me, I got to go.

132
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:35,707
There's an emergency at the gym.

133
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,742
- Emergency at the gym
just when two cops

134
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:39,010
show up at his door.

135
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:40,712
That seems suspicious.
We should follow him.

136
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:43,380
- Yeah, this case might
actually lead somewhere.

137
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,149
- Why are you so surprised?

138
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:48,920
- Because every day
on this job is a wonder.

139
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:52,824
- Damn right it is.

140
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:06,771
- Medical examiner,
jackpot.

141
00:05:06,804 --> 00:05:08,639
The gym is full of bodies.

142
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,341
- No, Department of Health.
- Oh.

143
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:11,976
- There's been an outbreak
of the mumps.

144
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,779
- [chuckles]
Mumps, that's a funny word.

145
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:16,748
- It's actually a very serious
and highly contagious

146
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:17,815
infectious disease.

147
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:18,850
- Yeah, but we're fine.

148
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,851
We were only in contact
with that guy

149
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,285
for a couple of seconds.

150
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:23,254
Plus, he didn't even
lick any of our eyeballs.

151
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:24,922
- I'm afraid you both
have the mumps.

152
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:28,459
- [chuckles] Mumps,
still a funny word.

153
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:29,861
Are we gonna die?

154
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:35,933
Sorry to say,
it's very contagious.

155
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,002
You may not want to
be here, detective.

156
00:05:38,035 --> 00:05:39,203
- Oh, it's cool.

157
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,005
I keep up to date
on all my vaccinations.

158
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,040
I'm immune to stuff
you've never even heard of.

159
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:45,977
- But not immune to braggadocio.

160
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,812
- Anyhow, over the next
several hours,

161
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:49,346
you will more than likely
develop fever,

162
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,547
aching, fatigue.

163
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:51,983
- Doesn't sound too bad.

164
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:53,785
- Also, tart foods will cause
intense jaw pain,

165
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:55,552
so you may want to avoid
sour candies.

166
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:56,788
- What?

167
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,455
- You may get painful
goiter-like swelling

168
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:02,026
in your neck and often extreme
testicular discomfort.

169
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,360
- Okay, okay.
- Cool, cool.

170
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:04,929
both: Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

171
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:06,197
- No doubt.

172
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,932
- Due the highly contagious
nature of the virus,

173
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:09,801
you will both be quarantined
to your houses

174
00:06:09,867 --> 00:06:11,135
for the next nine days.

175
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:13,104
- Oh, nine days in isolation.

176
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:15,039
- Sir, I'd be happy
to keep you company.

177
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:17,074
We can watch the ten-part
Nicholas Nickleby

178
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:18,810
special on PBS.

179
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:21,078
Hear there's a lot of long,
quiet stretches.

180
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:22,814
- I do love long,
quiet stretches,

181
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,281
but I don't want to be a burden.

182
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:27,819
Plus, I'm getting used
to being on my own.

183
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:31,122
- Or we could be quarantined
together, you know,

184
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:32,990
work the case.

185
00:06:33,057 --> 00:06:35,592
- Yes, that actually sounds
kind of fun.

186
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:36,727
- Kind of?

187
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:37,962
It's gonna be
the best week ever.

188
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:39,831
- I'm sorry, did you not
hear me say

189
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,632
extreme testicular discomfort?

190
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:44,836
- Yes, we heard you,
Dr. Bad News Doctor.

191
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,670
- Okay, so I talked
to Captain Holt.

192
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:48,305
He and Jake have the mumps.

193
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,241
I'm in charge until
Holt gets better.

194
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:52,309
- Hello, you wanted to see
if you can make

195
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:53,310
a great captain.

196
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:54,946
Now's your chance to shine.

197
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,848
You're the pretty little
understudy.

198
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:58,349
And the aging lead?

199
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:00,651
Well, she just fell
down the stairs.

200
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:04,021
Now all's you got to do
is beat those wings

201
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:06,090
and fly.

202
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:07,491
- So for the next
two weeks,

203
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:09,393
Captain Holt will be
on medical leave,

204
00:07:09,426 --> 00:07:11,762
which means I am
the acting captain.

205
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,931
- And we are your royal
subjects.

206
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,366
Do continue.

207
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:17,234
- I want this precinct to get
our normal work done,

208
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:20,204
but also, we're gonna clean out
the evidence room,

209
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:21,605
step up community service,

210
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:26,077
and complete these
22 additional tasks.

211
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,079
Every time we check one
off the list,

212
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:29,580
you're gonna hear this bell.

213
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:32,449
It's the sound of victory.

214
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:34,618
- Hmm, you should add
"fix bell" to that list.

215
00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:37,621
- Morning, Captain.
- Peralta.

216
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:40,391
- I'd like to introduce you
to someone.

217
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:42,093
[groans]

218
00:07:42,126 --> 00:07:43,594
His name is Simon,

219
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:44,896
and I hate him.

220
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:46,763
- Hello, Simon.

221
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:49,100
This is Balthazar.

222
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:51,602
He's an evil demon
who spits fire in my throat.

223
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:52,769
- Goiters, huh?

224
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,071
- Anyway.

225
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:55,572
I've been looking over
these photographs

226
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,141
of the restaurant,
and I've identified

227
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,742
several other known mob types.

228
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,044
- [groans]

229
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,312
- What is it?
Did you see something?

230
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:03,480
- No, I just got very cold
very fast.

231
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:06,117
And now my entire body
is somehow on fire.

232
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,719
Oh, these mumps are jerks.
Whew.

233
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:11,388
- I also noticed
this van is parked out front

234
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,157
in several other photographs.

235
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,458
- I never noticed that.

236
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:16,160
The restaurant must have been
under surveillance.

237
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:17,161
I bet it was the feds.

238
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:18,329
- You're right.

239
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:19,363
- I'll reach out to my contact
at the bureau,

240
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:20,397
see if I can get us some
footage.

241
00:08:20,464 --> 00:08:21,632
- Good idea.

242
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:22,733
- Also, I know you're not
supposed to,

243
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,335
but I kind of want to
poke my mump.

244
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:25,802
- Bad idea.
- I'm going in.

245
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:27,972
Here we go.
[yelps]

246
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:29,140
It hurts!

247
00:08:29,173 --> 00:08:32,076
How did I not see
that coming?

248
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:33,344
I feel dizzy.

249
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:35,412
- Hey.

250
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,480
You're off the floor.

251
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:37,681
- Yeah.

252
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:39,083
Well, it's like my dad
used to say.

253
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,952
"Real men don't cry

254
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:42,219
for more than three days."

255
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:44,155
So I decided to get my butt
back to work.

256
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:45,356
- Good.

257
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:46,490
you go through
all the witness statements yet?

258
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:47,959
- What?
Oh, no.

259
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:50,827
By "work," I meant on Jason's
in memoriam video.

260
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,396
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

261
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:54,831

00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:14,118
Focus up and stop
watching funny dog videos.

267
00:09:14,151 --> 00:09:16,187
- Aw.

268
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:17,989
- This might just be
the fever talking,

269
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:20,291
but this unedited footage
of an Italian restaurant

270
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:22,826
from eight years ago might be
the best movie I've ever seen.

271
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:24,261
Also, how weird are forks?

272
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:27,164
- Forks are very weird.
I've always thought so.

273
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,433
- Yeah, yeah.

274
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:31,002
Did we take too much
cold medicine?

275
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,203
- Not by a long shot.

276
00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:34,171
Balthazar is a thirsty bitch.

277
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,207
- Ah, I'll drink to that.

278
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,712
- Wait, look.

279
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:44,348
- Garkabargo!

280
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,018
Sorry, can't—can't talk.

281
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:50,887
Need more medi-jen.

282
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,024
Garibaldi!

283
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,559
He's eating snakes!

284
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:58,295
No, it's spaghetti.

285
00:09:58,329 --> 00:09:59,997
- It's always spaghetti.

286
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,832
- I'm just saying,
if that's spaghetti,

287
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:04,035
it looks like snakes.

288
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:05,302
[bell chimes]

289
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:06,537
- That's right, Nine-Nine.

290
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,505
That's the sound
of the victory bell.

291
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:11,308
We just crossed our first task
off the list.

292
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:12,209
- Oh, my goodness.

293
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:13,810
Terry, that is so great.

294
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:14,878
Which one was it?

295
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,713
- Fix bell.
- All right.

296
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:19,216
Little less than I had
hoped for, but still a thing.

297
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,984
- You gonna hear that sound
nonstop.

298
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:23,320
- Unhand her, you beast!

299
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:24,355
- Give it to me!

300
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,223
- What the hell is going on
in here?

301
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:27,691
- Hitchcock's trying
to steal my sandwich.

302
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:29,060
- Well, we both ordered
meatball subs,

303
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,061
but they only delivered one.

304
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:31,395
It's mine!

305
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:34,365
- Guys, guys, look,
just walk to the sub shop—

306
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:37,234
it's a block away—
and get a second sandwich.

307
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:39,236
- Walk?
- Are you insane?

308
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,238
- Fine, cut the damn
sandwich in half.

309
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:44,075
- And then what, genius?
We each eat a 6-inch sub?

310
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:45,442
- Two and a half meatballs
a piece?

311
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:47,344
- Are we children?
- What is this, Russia?

312
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:49,413
- Okay, that's it.
No one eats the sub.

313
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,382
Get back to work!

314
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:55,886
- Wait a minute.

315
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,221
Why'd he just go
in the kitchen?

316
00:10:57,254 --> 00:10:58,355
Do we have eyes
in the kitchen?

317
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,157
- There are eyes everywhere,
man.

318
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:02,593
- Ow, ow, achy, achy, ow.

319
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:05,096
Look, he slipped the chef
a piece of paper.

320
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:06,630
I bet it's the address
of his hideout.

321
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:08,299
The chef knows where
the hideout is.

322
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,834
- His name is Richie Lignardi.

323
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,936
We talk to him,
we find Garibaldi.

324
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:15,672
- We have to go right now.

325
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,108
- Go where?

326
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,275
Ah!
What's on your face?

327
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:22,179
- Oh, right, uh, yes,
my disgusting deformity.

328
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,981
Here, let me just—

00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:26,850
Hey, what's up, girl?

330
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:27,851
Better?

331
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:29,320
- It's not worse.

332
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:31,622
- We're on our way right now
to talk to a lead

333
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,357
that knows where Garibaldi's
hideout is.

334
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,725
- You're quarantined.

335
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,693
You can't go outside
spewing mumps

336
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,229
like a couple of
mump fountains.

337
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:39,830
- Not like this, we can't!

00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:51,742
- Good luck trying
to stop us.

345
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:55,246
You'll never catch us!

346
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:57,214
Amy is Usain Bolt.

347
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:59,250
- Is this the piece of paper
you're looking for?

348
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:00,651
- You found the address?

349
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:03,554
- No, it's a recipe
for baked ziti.

350
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:06,056
It was taped to your wall
the entire time.

351
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:07,758
You're delirious,
and you're sick,

352
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,326
and you definitely didn't
solve the case.

353
00:12:09,393 --> 00:12:10,794
You need to go back inside.

354
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:12,396
- Well, I can't.

355
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:13,597
My legs stopped working.

356
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,266
[grunting]

357
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,600
Ah, my testicles.

358
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,402
The mumps have reached
my testicles.

359
00:12:23,006 --> 00:12:24,308
taking off your totally
ineffective biohazard suits

360
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,476
and have a little rest.

361
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:26,677
- Nonsense, Santiago.

362
00:12:26,743 --> 00:12:28,845
We just have to buckle down
and work harder.

363
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:30,647
We simply hit a bump
in the road.

364
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:33,184
- More like a mump
in the road.

365
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,951
[laughter]

366
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:37,821
[both groaning and yelling]

367
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:39,089
- Such a good one.

368
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,024
Jake, can I talk to you
in private for a minute?

369
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:43,627
- Sure thing, let me just
snag this,

370
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,196
cover up the ol' swell sack.

371
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:46,297
- All right.

372
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,864
- Okay, so here's the deal.

373
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:49,966
I have a high fever,
and I can't control my body,

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,602
but you can do whatever
you want to me.

375
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:55,306
Oh, but don't touch my mouth,
neck, or testicles.

376
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,208
- You've badly misread
the situation.

377
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,542
- Oh, thank God.

378
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,744
- Jake, you need
to drop this case.

379
00:13:00,777 --> 00:13:01,878
- What are you talking about?

380
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:03,013
The plan is working perfectly.

381
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:04,215
Holt hasn't been lonely
all week.

382
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:05,916
- Yeah, because he's too busy
almost dying.

383
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:08,519
Look at him.
- What?

384
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,354
He's just "Beautiful Mind"-ing
it.

385
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:12,256
Because he's a genius.

386
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:15,025
- He's writing the word "case"
over and over again.

387
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:17,127
Oh, now he's spelling it
with a K.

388
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:18,629
- Is that not how you spell it?

389
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:21,031
Again, I have a mouth, neck,
and testicle-melting fever.

390
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:22,032
- Jake.
- Hmm?

391
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:23,567
- Enough is enough.

392
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,135
You need to drop this stupid
backburner cold case

393
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,771
before you both die
or I will kill you.

394
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:33,377
- Oh, my God, I thought I was
following her.

395
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,145
Yep, I should probably lie down.

396
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:37,981
Here we go.

397
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,115
- Case!

398
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,721
- What are you doing?

399
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,458
- Just sealing Jason's collar
in an airtight bag

400
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:48,892
so it retains his scent.

401
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,961
I don't know how many whiffs
I have left.

402
00:13:50,994 --> 00:13:53,063
- Wow.

403
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:54,965
Look, I know that dog
meant a lot to you,

404
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:56,833
so I got you this.

405
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:00,671
It's a dog.

406
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,273
His name's Arlo,
but you can call him Jason Two

407
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:03,307
or whatever.

408
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,741
- Seriously?

409
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:06,877
I can't just replace Jason
with some other dog.

410
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,979
- Why not?
All dogs are basically the same.

411
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:11,515
Watch this.
Arlo, go hump that toy.

412
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:12,983
- Get away from that.

413
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,518
That's Jason's.
[toy squeaks]

414
00:14:14,551 --> 00:14:16,820
- Look, man,
I've been patient.

415
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:18,289
We have a case we need
to work on.

416
00:14:18,322 --> 00:14:20,491
It's time for you to
get over it, move on.

417
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:22,993
- Move on?
Move on.

418
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:24,895
Jason was part of my family,
Rosa.

419
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:26,530
I loved him.

420
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:29,300
His humping was the only thing
that got me through my divorce.

421
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,335
Seeing him so happy
made me believe

422
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:34,505
that I could be happy
one day too.

423
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,072
You wouldn't understand this
because you have

424
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:40,076
a motorcycle helmet for a heart,
but I need to feel this sadness.

425
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,447
So the only thing that I'm
moving on from is you.

426
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,621
- So I, like, have a dog now?

427
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:54,057
- Hey, what's going on
with those files?

428
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,626
- Oh, we're not working on them.

429
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:57,428
We're on strike.
- Hunger strike.

430
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:00,096
- You're eating potato chips.
- Chips don't count.

431
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,499
My doctor said they have
zero nutritional value.

432
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,100
- We want meatball subs.

433
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:05,969
You had no right to take ours.

434
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,371
- Screw this.

435
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:10,341
I'll log those files
and teach the hazmat class,

436
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:12,709
and I'll do everyone's work,
because apparently,

437
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:15,045
I am the only one keeping
this precinct together!

438
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:21,117
[glass shattering]

439
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:26,857
- Um, I think you
closed the door too hard.

440
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,126
- Hey, I found popsicles.

441
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,529
These should help
cool us down.

442
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:35,999
[groans]

443
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:37,233
"Thanks, Jake."

444
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:38,869
You're welcome, nards.

445
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:41,171
- Peralta, Balthazar
has a sister.

446
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:43,674
Meet Penelope.

447
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,176
- Guh-hoo, yeah,
mumps on mumps.

448
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,379
- Let's not dwell on it.
We should get back to work.

449
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,814
- Or we could fall asleep
for five to seven days

450
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,048
and see how we feel.

451
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:53,684
- I will not rest till
justice is served.

452
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:54,718
There's no time to waste.

453
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:55,986
This case is urgent.

454
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,988
- Oh, boy.

455
00:15:58,021 --> 00:15:59,255
All right, listen.

456
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,992
The case may not be
quite as urgent

457
00:16:02,058 --> 00:16:04,060
as once thought.

458
00:16:04,094 --> 00:16:05,896
Um...

459
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,831
I dug it up out of my desk
so you'd have something

460
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:10,100
to do on weekends
because you seemed so lonely.

461
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,568
- You cited chatter
from the streets

462
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:13,003
that Garibaldi had resurfaced.

463
00:16:13,069 --> 00:16:14,405
- I did. I did. I did.

464
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:18,241
But said chatter
may have been fudged.

465
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,977
- So you lied to me?

466
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,145
Out of pity.
You pity me.

467
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:23,146
- I wouldn't put it that way.

468
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,147
- I would.

469
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,816
I am offended.
I am angry.

470
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:27,317
I am very tired.

471
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,586
So I'm gonna take a nap,
but when I wake up,

472
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,489
oh, you are in for it.

473
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,493
How dare you?

474
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:37,994
- How dare me?

475
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,330
How dare you?

476
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:41,932
I was just trying to help.

477
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:44,167
- Wow, your help feels an awful
lot like pity,

478
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,303
so do me a favor and don't
ever help me again.

479
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:49,540
- Wow, well, you didn't seem
to mind me helping you

480
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:52,275
when I got you your job back
at the Nine-Nine.

481
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:56,046
- I didn't ask you to do that.

482
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:57,213
- [gasps]

483
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,183
You said we were
out of peas, you pea hog!

484
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:02,118
- You're the pea hog!
- You're the pea hog!

485
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:03,787
- No, you!
- You take that back!

486
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,890
- You!
[both screaming]

487
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:07,891
- Double poke!

488
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:10,927
[both grunting]

489
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,472
Made baked ziti.

490
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:23,574
Thought it would be fun
to use Garibaldi's

491
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,542
ultra authentic recipe.

492
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:27,644
- Oh, great, pity food.

493
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:29,713
Thank you anyway,
but I can cook for myself.

494
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:32,649
- Wow, I would roll my eyes
so hard right now

495
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:33,984
if it didn't make
my brain burn.

496
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,386
- Okay, Captain,
this ends now.

497
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,054
I know your pride is hurt,
but no one

498
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,656
ever took pity on you.

499
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:40,991
All we wanted to do
was help you

500
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:42,726
when you were down because
that's what people do

501
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,260
when they care about each other.

502
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:46,497
- They tell each other lies
and invent urgent mysteries

503
00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:47,764
that need to be solved?

504
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:50,501
- Come up with excuses
to spend time together

505
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,737
like trivia nights
or folk art festivals.

506
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,773
- Or working old-ass cases
with their mumpy boy, Jake.

507
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,642
Back to you, Amy.
We're doing great.

508
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:00,811
- You're gonna eat this ziti,
and you're gonna appreciate it,

509
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:04,147
and you're gonna
grow the hell up.

510
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,584
- Okay, you're right.

511
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,554
I'm sorry for the way I acted.

512
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,022
I can't wait to eat your food.

513
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:17,661
Ugh, this is revolting.

514
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:21,164
- Wow, have you learned nothing?

515
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:22,699
Oh, God!

516
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:24,668
That is worse
than the mumps, Amy.

517
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:25,769
- What the hell?

518
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:28,171
I used Garibaldi's
exact recipe.

519
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:29,272
I know I'm not a great cook,

520
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:30,841
but I love following
instructions.

521
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:32,709
- Seven cups of salt?

522
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:34,010
Even I know this isn't
a recipe.

523
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:35,546
Which means it might be a code.

524
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:37,681
- Ooh, interesting.

525
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:39,916
Ten digits, maybe it's
a phone number.

526
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,352
Look, 718, Brooklyn area code.

527
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:44,054
- Yes, that's definitely it.

528
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:46,590
Wait, did you actually use
all of this salt

529
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:48,725
and 18 cups of oregano?

530
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,193
- Back off, I solved the case.

531
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:51,461
- Nine onions?

532
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:52,763
Oh, Amy.

533
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,698
- How am I the bad guy here?

534
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:59,770
- All right, all right,
looks good.

535
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,672
I can barely tell you
hulked out in here.

536
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,840
- Yeah, but two weeks
in charge,

537
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:05,942
and I didn't get any
of my goals accomplished.

538
00:19:05,976 --> 00:19:08,278
- You got Hitchcock and Scully
off their hunger strike.

539
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,013
- I just threw a bunch
of popcorn on the floor.

540
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,381
It wasn't that hard.

541
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:13,283
- Yeah, they're animals.

542
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:16,186
Do you want to know why
the amazing Captain Holt

543
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:18,154
has never gotten the evidence
room cleaned

544
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:19,590
or done anything on your list?

545
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,857
- Why?

546
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:22,793
- Because all day long,
he's putting out fires.

547
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,695
That's what a captain does.

548
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,663
The only difference between
you and Holt

549
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:29,465
is that he lacks the strength
to close a door so hard

550
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:30,701
a room blows up.

551
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,035
- Thanks, Gina.

552
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:33,970
- Ah, you don't
have to thank me.

553
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:37,307
All I did was be the only person
who believes in you.

554
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,809
- Don't lean against the door.

555
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:41,244
Terry caused structural damage.

556
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,846
- My God, you're strong.

557
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:47,684
- Briefing room, now.

558
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:52,723
- I really don't feel like
having you yell at me anymore.

559
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:53,724
What is this?

560
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,892
- It's a funeral for Jason.

561
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:57,427
I want to say a few words.

562
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:04,768
When Jason died seven days ago,
I didn't give a rat's ass.

563
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,369
- This is your speech?

564
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:07,871
- 'Cause I didn't understand
why people care so much

565
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:10,707
about their dumb dogs
till I got a dumb dog myself.

566
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:15,612
I've only had Arlo
for a day and a half,

567
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,614
but if anything happened to him,
I would kill everyone

568
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,082
in this room and then myself.

569
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:21,718
- Very violent eulogy,
I like it.

570
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:22,953
- Charles, I'm sorry.

571
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,420
You don't have to get over it.

572
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:26,389
Take as long as you want.

573
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:28,058
Scully, it's time.

574
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:31,962
♪ Ave Maria ♪

575
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:35,231
- Okay, thank you.

576
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:36,867
Good news, Garibaldi's
phone number's still active,

577
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,201
so they were able to locate him.

578
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,637
SWAT just picked him up,
so that's that.

579
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:41,972
- Yeah, that's that.

580
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:44,708
- Perfect timing as our
quarantine has finally ended

581
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:45,976
and our goiters are gone.

582
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:47,377
- Yes, indeed.

583
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,745
We're free to go outside
and lick whoever's

584
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:49,980
eyeballs we'd like.

585
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,614
- Inaccurate, no one is ever
free to do that.

586
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:52,649
- Yeah, you're right.

587
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:55,085
Anyhow, I am out.

588
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,419
- Wait a minute.

589
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:01,291
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

590
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:04,460
I was too proud to admit
I was lonely.

591
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,897
So thank you.

592
00:21:06,963 --> 00:21:08,364
- You're welcome.

593
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:09,800
Ain't no thang.

594
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,868
- No, it is a thang,
and an even bigger thang

595
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,569
is that you brought me
back to the Nine-Nine,

596
00:21:13,704 --> 00:21:16,006
and I will always
be grateful for that.

597
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,709
So here.

598
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,713
This is for you.

599
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:27,317
- Sour candies,
I missed you so much.

600
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,886
[yells] It burns!

601
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,888
Thank you for this gift.

602
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:33,924
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
