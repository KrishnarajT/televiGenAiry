- Why do you have that thing?

12
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:31,093
- Because they were gonna
throw him away,

I'm gonna ask her out.

I know we just met,

180
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:41,469
and I don't want
to be too forward...

181
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,470
- Charles.

182
00:05:42,504 --> 00:05:43,471
- But sometimes you just get

183
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:44,472
a feeling about a person...

184
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,507
- Charles.

185
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,574
- And I've got
that feeling about you.

186
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:47,909
I like you...
- Charles, look down.

187
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:48,910
- I think tonight we—

188
00:05:48,943 --> 00:05:50,244
oh, shoot.

189
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,614
- They just gave me
ten years in prison.

190
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,588
- She didn't say no.

191
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,495
Got you some of those
fish donuts you like so much

192
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,830
to cheer you up.

193
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:09,997
Although, full disclosure,

194
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:11,065
I couldn't find
where they sold them,

195
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:12,434
so that's just
a chocolate éclair

196
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:13,601
with lox on it.

197
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:15,269
- Oh, thanks, Jake,
but I don't need cheering up.

198
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:16,270
You can eat it yourself.

199
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:17,539
- Nope.

200
00:06:17,572 --> 00:06:18,873
So what, you're not upset
about falling hard

201
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:20,274
for a lady who was
immediately thrown in jail?

202
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:22,309
- No, because she's
not actually guilty.

203
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:23,845
They say she robbed
her own art gallery

204
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:26,213
for the insurance money,
but that makes no sense.

205
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:28,115
She would have made more
if the art had sold.

206
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:29,984
This piece,
"Breastfeeding Knight,"

207
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:32,253
was worth twice what she got
from the insurance company.

208
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:33,287
- Wow, look at that.

209
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,689
Not to sound
overly intellectual,

210
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:37,559
but dem knight boobies
is crazy.

211
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:38,960
[laughs]
I get art.

212
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:41,195
- Also, I talked to
Genevieve's lawyer.

213
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:42,964
He's a total disaster.

214
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:45,166
I have a couple questions about
a beautiful client of yours,

215
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,468
Genevieve Mirren-Carter.

216
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:48,536
- She got hit by a tow truck
and sued the driver?

217
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,971
- No, she was accused
of insurance fraud.

218
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:53,174
- Oh, good, because I blew
that tow truck case.

219
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:54,776
Straight-up forgot
to go to court.

220
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,178
- Well, they found one of the
stolen paintings at her house.

221
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:58,846
- But she said she didn't
know how it ended up there.

222
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,482
She's being set up.
- Framed.

223
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:01,549
Art joke.
Continue.

224
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,350
- My hunch is that it's
a jealous ex-lover.

225
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:06,554
A girl like that, three dogs,
makes her own turkey stock,

226
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:09,090
that's the kind of woman
you don't get over.

227
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:11,125
Look, I know you think
my judgment's clouded

228
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:12,259
because I like her
a little bit...

229
00:07:12,293 --> 00:07:13,828
- You doodled your
wedding invitation.

230
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:15,497
- No, that's our
joint tombstone.

231
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,498
- My mistake.

232
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:17,865
- But as a cop,
I really don't

233
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,634
think that she did it.

234
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:22,069
Something is off
about the case.

235
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:23,538
- Okay, Boyle.

236
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:26,040
I trust your gut.

237
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:27,408
Let's go free
an innocent woman.

238
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:28,409
- Nice!

239
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,077
My dreams are coming true.

240
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:33,915
You and me getting
my lady off together.

241
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:35,950
- I mean, you know
how that sounds, right?

242
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,721
- Look strong but fair.

243
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:40,722
But approachable.

244
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:41,723
But professional.

245
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:42,924
And fun.

246
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:43,991
But not too fun.

247
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:44,992
This is your job.

248
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,293
Can you handle all that?

249
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:49,263
- Sir, "fun but not too fun"
was my campaign slogan

250
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:50,965
when I ran for prom queen.

251
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:52,433
- Did you win?

252
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:53,535
- No.

253
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:54,536
- Ames?

254
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:55,803
I want to say you look great.

255
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:56,804
- Thank you.

256
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:57,805
- You didn't let me finish.

257
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,806
Dot, dot, dot,

258
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,974
for you.

259
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:01,543
Great news is,
it doesn't matter,

260
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:02,877
because this campaign,

261
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,946
like three out of five
Backstreet Boys,

262
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,380
is inconsequential.

263
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:07,448
- That's enough, Gina.

264
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:08,950
- All I'm saying as a—
if not the—

265
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:12,186
voice of the streets is,
this tisn't gonna work.

266
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:14,221
- And all I'm saying as a—
if not the—

267
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,023
boss here is,
if you're not gonna support me,

268
00:08:16,057 --> 00:08:17,024
you can leave.

269
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:18,025
- Fine.

270
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:19,093
I will leave.

271
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,995
I'm gonna go get
a mani-pedi,

272
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,798
and I'm gonna do some
serious subtweeting,

273
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:25,132
so you might want to

274
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,734
[whispering]
keep off the net.

275
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,571
- Diaz.

276
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:30,638
Look what I found

277
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:32,807
in Hitchcock and Scully's
trash can:

278
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,875
ice cream spoon.

279
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:35,910
- Son of a bitch.

280
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,182
You hungry, hungry hippos
ate my ice cream.

281
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,250
Why was this in your trash?

282
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:44,919
- And who throws away a spoon?

283
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:46,854
It's the easiest
utensil to clean.

284
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:48,690
- I don't even think
it's ice cream.

285
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:50,091
It's probably medicine.

286
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:52,794
You know, I'm on
lots of medicines, Rosa.

287
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:55,196
I'm sick all over.

288
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:57,865
- This is ice cream,
and I'm gonna prove it.

289
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,166
- Sarge, no.

290
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,234
It's been in their mouths.

291
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,335
- What am I doing?

292
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:02,837
- Well, I guess
your little investigation

293
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,105
has hit a dead end.

294
00:09:04,138 --> 00:09:06,774
- I'll be back.

295
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:09,443
Don't move.

296
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:11,178
- Not a problem.

297
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:13,915
I hate moving.

298
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:15,416
- Let it go.

299
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,851
Let it go.

300
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:18,152
- Interesting.

301
00:09:18,185 --> 00:09:21,522
Yeah, something definitely
doesn't add up.

302
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:24,358
Did you know there's
a sausage you can drink?

303
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,359
- What?

304
00:09:25,392 --> 00:09:26,861
Are you even talking
about the case?

305
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:28,129
- We got distracted.

306
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:29,196
She has an amazing tongue.

307
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,666
Strong, supple,
great bud density.

308
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,134
- Okay, I'm gonna
take over the questioning.

309
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,335
- Yeah, I'm
too close to this.

310
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:35,436
- Disgusting eating habits.

311
00:09:35,469 --> 00:09:36,437
Hi, Genevieve.

312
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,438
I'm just gonna ask you

313
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:38,640
a couple of questions now,

314
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,042
and Detective Boyle
will just sit there

315
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:42,509
and keep waving at you,
I guess.

316
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:43,645
Now then,
is there anybody

317
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:44,846
you can think of
besides yourself

318
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,681
that has access
to the gallery after hours?

319
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:48,349
- No, just me,
and the vault is

320
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,517
only accessible
through fingerprint ID.

321
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,186
Does Charles
have a girlfriend?

322
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:53,187
- I just saw her mouth my name.

323
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,288
What did she say?

324
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,657
Is she asking
if I'm circumcised?

325
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:56,658
- What?
No.

326
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:57,659
Who asks that?

327
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:59,326
Stop interrupting.

328
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,327
Sorry about that.

329
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,328
Okay, next question.

330
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:02,529
Can you think of anyone

331
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:03,831
that might be
trying to set you up?

332
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:06,100
Maybe an employee
or a rival of some kind?

333
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:07,835
- Maybe my ex-boyfriend Nick.

334
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,704
He's an artist,
a terrible one.

335
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,739
He was always in debt
and begging for money.

336
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:12,940
That's why we broke up.

337
00:10:12,974 --> 00:10:14,375
Maybe he's resentful.

338
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:15,442
- Dirtbag ex.

339
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:16,911
- Oh, that was
my theory, remember?

340
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:17,912
Tell her it was my theory.

341
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:18,913
- Okay.
- Wait, give me a second.

342
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,147
I want to look smart
when you say it.

343
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:21,482
- Okay.

344
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:22,717
Uh, hey, Genevieve,

345
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,118
Detective Boyle wanted me
to let you know

346
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:26,587
that he, a college graduate,
had a similar theory

347
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,089
that it could have been
an ex-boyfriend.

348
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:29,123
- Wow.

349
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,257
He is so smart.

350
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,693
- Wow, it actually worked.

351
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:33,094
I've got to
hand it to you, buddy

352
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:34,428
whatever you're putting down,
she is picking up.

353
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:35,797
- Oh, good.

354
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,765
Oh, one more thing.
- Boyle has another question.

355
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,066
- Tell her
when this is all over,

356
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,367
I'm gonna rub her body
in pâté,

357
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:41,869
and then rub it off her
with a cornichon.

358
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:42,937
- I'm just gonna
give the phone back.

359
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,338
- Okay.

360
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:45,372
Hi.

361
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:49,744
Guard got nauseous,
so we had to stop.

362
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:50,878
- Hmm, that's weird.

363
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:52,013
Do you think it's because
you're the two

364
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:53,080
most disgusting people
in the universe?

365
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:54,816
- Could be.
- Yeah, check this out.

366
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:56,650
Remember the ex-boyfriend
that she mentioned, Nick?

367
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:58,052
- Call him Mr. Butthead.

368
00:10:58,085 --> 00:10:59,721
- Okay, well,
apparently Mr. Butthead

369
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:02,523
just bought a brand-new gallery
in Dumbo to showcase his art,

370
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:03,858
which is weird,
because Genevieve said

371
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:05,259
he was always in debt.

372
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:08,629
Looks like somebody just
came into a ton of money.

373
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,964
- Oh, and you think
she's gonna want to

374
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,799
get back together with him
now that he's rich.

375
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,300
Damn it!
- No, Boyle.

376
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:15,602
He probably got the cash
from selling the stolen art.

377
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:16,738
Your hunch was right.

378
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,039
- Yeah, it was.

379
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:21,242
♪ My hunch, my hunch,
my lovely case-y hunch ♪

380
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:22,343
Come on, Jake,
sing with me.

381
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:23,344
- That's not gonna happen.

382
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:24,578
I will literally never—

383
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:26,147
♪ Whatcha gonna do
with all that hunch ♪

384
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,982
♪ All that hunch

♪ Solve this case

387
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:34,021
- We should probably
leave this prison.

388
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:35,056
- Yep.

389
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,794
My name is Sherwin LeMonde,

390
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:42,096
sculptor, painter,
full-time barista.

391
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:45,266
But once I sell my first piece,
part-time barista.

392
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,267
- Oh, nice.

393
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,936
I'm Donald Hoberman-Seitz.

394
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,537
I wear glasses.

395
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:51,605
- Is that all you got?

396
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:54,108
- Sorry, I spent
the cab ride here imagining

397
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:55,576
me and Genevieve kissing.

398
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:57,244
- Okay, just let me
do the talking.

399
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:58,245
- Wine?

400
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,014
- Yes, thank you so much.

401
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:01,548
Oh, wow,
I love your outfit.

402
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:02,784
I'm an artist,
so I get that it's

403
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:04,151
more than just tight.

404
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:06,053
- Nick likes to
coat women in latex.

405
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:08,389
He's fascinated by the idea
of the human chrysalis

406
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:09,824
in society's pupation.

407
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:10,825
- Hmm, cool.

408
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,226
Human chrysalis
and whatnot.

409
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,295
- Yeah, whatnot.

410
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:15,296
It's a whatnot.

411
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,631
- Yeah, yeah.

412
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:19,066
I have no idea
what a chrysalis is,

413
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,067
but serious question:

414
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:21,068
if she farts in that thing,

415
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:22,269
does it blow up like a balloon?

416
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:23,337
- You have to assume
that it would.

417
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,338
- You have to, right?

418
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,606
- Yeah.
- Art is so intense.

419
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,941
- It really is.

420
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:28,309
Look, there's Nick.

421
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:32,713
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

422
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:33,815
- Is this your work?
- Yes.

423
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:35,116
- It's good.

424
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:36,918
I haven't talked to anyone here,
but it almost seems like

425
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,652
you're going for
a human chrysalis thing.

426
00:12:38,685 --> 00:12:39,921
- I'm glad you like it.

427
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:42,656
I wish I could take credit,
but this is society.

428
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:43,991
I'm just holding up
the mirror.

429
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:46,160
- Hmm?

430
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:47,494
Wow.

431
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:49,063
You meant that literally.

432
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:50,297
Very cool.

433
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:52,834
Anyhow, I'm a fellow artist
named Sherwin.

434
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,401
- I'm Donald Hoberman-Seitz.

435
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,137
I wear glasses.

436
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,138
- So anyway,
I was wondering.

437
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:58,139
How'd you get your own gallery?

438
00:12:58,172 --> 00:12:59,240
It must be really expensive.

439
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:00,975
- Art's not about
the money, man.

440
00:13:01,008 --> 00:13:02,009
- Totally.

441
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:04,745
It's more about
the other things.

442
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:05,980
- Right on.

443
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:08,715
- This painting is called
"Genevieve 416."

444
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:09,716
What's that all about?

445
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,052
- Well, April 16th was the day

446
00:13:11,085 --> 00:13:13,554
my ex, Genevieve, and I
covered ourselves with paint

447
00:13:13,587 --> 00:13:15,890
and made love on that canvas
for 24 hours straight.

448
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:17,224
- That's pretty pathetic, dude.

449
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:19,293
You seem pretty obsessed
with Genevieve, huh?

450
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:20,727
- Excuse me?
- Donald.

451
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:22,763
- I bet it really hurt
when she dumped you.

452
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:24,265
- What?
- Donald, your glasses.

453
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:26,033
- Where were you July 21st,
Mr. Butthead?

454
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,034
- Uh...

455
00:13:27,068 --> 00:13:28,702
[mocking]
- Uh, duh, uh...

456
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:30,737
you were robbing
Genevieve's gallery.

457
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:31,772
You framed her,

458
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:33,207
and I should
arrest you right now.

459
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,308
- What are you, cops?
- What?

460
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:36,210
No, we're artists.

461
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:38,179
And as artists,
we question everything,

462
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:40,882
including certain people's
whereabouts on particular dates.

463
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:41,883
- Get out of here.

464
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:43,184
- Fine, but we're taking this,

465
00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:44,751
because you don't
deserve that memory.

466
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:46,153
- That painting is $95,000.

467
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:47,154
- I don't want it anyway.

468
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:49,323
Your penis was on it.

469
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:50,324
- Sorry about that.

470
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:51,993
Donald is...

471
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:53,027
sucks.

472
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:56,663
- Hey, you dum-dums.

473
00:13:56,697 --> 00:13:57,899
Ice cream.

474
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,234
Moose tracks ice cream.

475
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:01,702
- How do you know?

476
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,470
- Yep, it's
definitely ice cream.

477
00:14:03,504 --> 00:14:04,906
- Knew it!
- They're going down.

478
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:08,575
- Also, whoever used this spoon,
their body ain't right.

479
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,177
- Okay, let's say
it is ice cream.

480
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:12,313
But I didn't eat it;
I couldn't have.

481
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:13,780
I'm lactose intolerant.

482
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:14,916
- Me too.

483
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,918
I'm super lactose intolerant.

484
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:17,919
- You're lying.

485
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,320
- Have you ever
seen us eat dairy?

486
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:21,655
- You know no one can bear
to watch you eat.

487
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:23,090
- Check.

488
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:24,591
- And...

489
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,093
check.

490
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:27,828
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

491
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:29,396
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

492
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,132
- I got to say, Boyle.

493
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,733
Nick was pretty defensive.

494
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:34,668
- Yeah, and he's
a terrible artist.

495
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:36,803
All he does is
have sex on canvases.

496
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:39,440
Any fourth grader
could do that.

497
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,508
- But...

498
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:42,509
they shouldn't.

499
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:43,677
- No.

500
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,679
- Hey, Nick doesn't like cops,

501
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:46,948
but he didn't do anything wrong.

502
00:14:46,948 --> 00:14:48,115
- And how would you know?

503
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:49,951
- I'm his assistant, Dvora.

504
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:51,252
He would never
set up Genevieve.

505
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:52,486
He's still in love with her.

506
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,621
He keeps boxes of
her old stuff lying around.

507
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:56,958
- Ooh, can we look at,
smell, and handle them?

508
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:58,292
I mean, you know,
for the investigation.

509
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,793
We're cops.

510
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:01,095
- Please, take the boxes.

511
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:02,096
I want them out of here.

512
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:03,430
- Oh, okay, great.

513
00:15:03,464 --> 00:15:04,565
You wouldn't happen
to know where he was

514
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:05,967
on July 21st, would you?

515
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,034
- Actually, I would.

516
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:09,336
He did a performance art piece
that entire month.

517
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,872
He lived in a cage on the street
and never left it.

518
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:12,974
The whole thing's on video.

519
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:14,208
- Okay, great.

520
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,209
Totally.

521
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:16,343
We'll just go around back

522
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:17,878
and pick up the boxes.

523
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:19,546
Oh, one more thing.

524
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,882
Where in this "cage"
did he go to the bathroom?

525
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:22,984
- Bucket.
- Okay, gross.

526
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:23,985
Have a good night.

527
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,289
- Sir, I saw my poster
on the subway this morning.

528
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:29,890
- Well, you must feel
like a celebrity,

529
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,658
a regular Ira Glass.

530
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:36,197
- They put a Hitler
mustache on me.

531
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,332
- Yes, this is unfortunate,

532
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:40,434
but let's not overreact
to one graffito.

533
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,003
- It wasn't just one.

534
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,671
People drew on
every single poster.

535
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:48,375
They put devil horns,
target on my face,

536
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,012
this one says, "Die Pig,"
and worst of all,

537
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:53,047
they didn't put the comma
between "Die" and "Pig."

538
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,381
- This is easily dealt with.

539
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:55,449
I'll just issue
a statement saying

540
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:57,018
vandals will be prosecuted.

541
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,120
- It's not just vandalism, sir.

542
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:01,688
People have
real complaints too.

543
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:03,024
"End stop and frisks.

544
00:16:03,024 --> 00:16:04,291
"Stop racial profiling.

545
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,593
Unlawful arrest is a crime."

546
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:07,728
- I see.

547
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:09,563
- I think Gina was right
about the campaign, sir.

548
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:11,132
- Hmm.

549
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,567
I'm surprised she hasn't marched
in here to say, "I told you so."

550
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,901
- She wouldn't do that.

551
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,038
- You're right, Amy.

552
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:19,440
For once in your life,
you're 100% right.

553
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:21,175
I would never say that.

554
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,782
Did you have enough time
to read it all?

555
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:29,850
- Yes.

556
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:31,152
- Okay, good.

557
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:33,054
- Yep, it's true.

558
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:34,488
He sat in a cage for a month.

559
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,323
- Eww,
the bucket checks out.

560
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:37,324
- This is insane.

561
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:38,425
Anything is art.

562
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,526
Here, watch this.

563
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,528
A statue of Jesus
made out of cigarette butts.

564
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:42,863
Boom, I'm a millionaire.

565
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:44,465
- That's actually pretty good.
- I know.

566
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:45,799
And I could
call it "Holy Smokes."

567
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,068
Should we really do this?

568
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:48,535
No, right?

569
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,237
That's crazy; you can't just
become an artist out of nowhere.

570
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:51,238
- Jake.
- What?

571
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:52,473
- The case.
- Yeah.

572
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:53,607
- So Nick has an alibi;
that's not great.

573
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,808
But we have a box

574
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:56,543
of Genevieve's stuff
from the gallery.

575
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:58,379
I'm sure there's something
in here that will exonerate her.

576
00:16:58,412 --> 00:16:59,913
- Right.
- Oh, my God.

577
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,648
Socks and shoes.

578
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,817
This is exactly
the type of stuff I own.

579
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,586
This is kismet.

580
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,354
Oh, no,
what's this?

581
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:08,722
It's a receipt
for a storage unit

582
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:10,357
that she didn't
tell anyone about.

583
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:11,658
- It's probably nothing.
- Yeah.

584
00:17:11,692 --> 00:17:12,693
Yeah, yeah.

585
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:13,694
I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah.

586
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,995
- It's totally nothing.
- No.

587
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:19,400
- It's a bunch of
stolen art.

588
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,434
- [sighs]

589
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,107
Sorry about Genevieve.

590
00:17:26,107 --> 00:17:27,141
- It's okay.

591
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:28,975
I'm resigned to
my life of solitude.

592
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,844
Just me and my five dogs.

593
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:32,479
- Wait, I thought
you only had three dogs.

594
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:34,715
- I just adopted two
online right now.

595
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:35,949
Oh, this pit bull hates kids.

596
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:37,118
That's fine;
I'll never have any.

597
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:38,119
Add to cart.

598
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:42,123
- Okay, let me just grab that.

599
00:17:42,123 --> 00:17:43,324
Listen to me, Charles.

600
00:17:43,357 --> 00:17:44,325
You're gonna be fine.

601
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:45,959
There are plenty
of women out there.

602
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:48,262
Strong, beautiful, smart women.

603
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:49,263
How about her?

604
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:50,764
She's very beautiful.

605
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:52,833
- With my luck,
she's probably a car thief.

606
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:53,834
- Don't be ridiculous.

607
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,336
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?

608
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:56,437
- Who's the babe?

609
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,639
- Just booked her
for elder abuse.

610
00:17:58,672 --> 00:17:59,740
- Elder abuse,
that's nice.

611
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:00,907
All right, fine.

612
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,443
We shouldn't be
doing this at a precinct.

613
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:04,478
- I really thought I was gonna
get Genevieve out of prison.

614
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:05,879
Then we'd cover
ourselves in paint

615
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,882
and make love for 25 hours,
one more hour than her and Nick.

616
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:09,950
- Boyle, you would hate that.

617
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,918
Your little hummingbird heart
would explode.

618
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:14,321
- I wish I didn't have a heart.

619
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:16,357
I'm off to
the cheese shop...

620
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:20,161
And I'm buying by the wheel.

621
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:21,962
The cheese wheel.
- Yeah, I got it.

622
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:23,464
- Gina, as you predicted,

623
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:25,966
there was some backlash
to the poster campaign.

624
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:29,303
- Yes, I'm the Nostradamus
of your shame.

625
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:30,804
- I think a problem
the police have had

626
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:33,574
is our inability
to admit our mistakes,

627
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:36,643
so this campaign

628
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:40,046
was, um...

629
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,047
a mistake.

630
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:42,249
You told me that,

631
00:18:42,283 --> 00:18:43,550
but I got defensive
and didn't listen.

632
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,452
I should have been
open to criticism,

633
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:48,622
as this department should be
open to criticism.

634
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:52,659
That's why I'm
replacing these with...

635
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:58,765
These.

636
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,201
My email address
is at the bottom,

637
00:19:00,234 --> 00:19:02,936
and I intend to respond
to every message I receive.

638
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:05,472
Before we put them up,
I want to hear your thoughts.

639
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:06,973
- I love them.

640
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,711
Once again, my advice has,
like, saved the city.

641
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:11,878
- I came up with the slogan.

642
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,415
- It's tacky to
take credit for stuff.

643
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:17,718
- We're here to apologize.

644
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,253
I can't prove you took
my moose tracks,

645
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:20,387
so I shouldn't have
yelled at you.

646
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:21,555
- I'm impressed.

647
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,089
It takes a big person to admit

648
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,658
when they're being
a total dum-dum.

649
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:26,227
- We want to
make it up to you.

650
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,361
We got you a pizza.

651
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:30,364
- Only one pizza
for both of us?

652
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:31,998
- Oh, my God.

653
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:34,668
That was an obvious
setup, you morons.

654
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,237
- You're eating cheese.

655
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:38,339
You're lying about
being lactose intolerant.

656
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:39,340
- No, we weren't.

657
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:40,674
Some things are
just delicious enough

658
00:19:40,707 --> 00:19:42,243
to suffer the consequences.

659
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:44,245
I'm diabetic, but I still
eat sugar out of the bag.

660
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:45,246
both: Ugh!

661
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:47,548
- Just admit you took
my moose tracks.

662
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:49,250
Admit it!

663
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,984
Admit...

664
00:19:51,017 --> 00:19:52,553
It.

665
00:19:52,586 --> 00:19:54,255
- Yeah, we ate it.

666
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,557
And we're eating your pizza.

667
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,894
So who's the moron now?

668
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,696
Ooh, stomach.

669
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:03,697
- Oh, yeah.

670
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,167
It's coming.

671
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,168
- They admitted it.

672
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,070
That's a victory, right?

673
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:11,738
- No, Terry.

674
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:12,806
There are no winners here.

675
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:13,807
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

676
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,808
Coming through,
coming through!

677
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:15,909
Move it!

678
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:17,611
Move, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

679
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:22,082
- Getting in a little late there
this morning, Boyle.

680
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,083
Where you been?

681
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:24,117
- Cursing out my own shadow

682
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,620
for hanging out
with a loser like me.

683
00:20:26,653 --> 00:20:27,954
Also an eye doctor
appointment.

684
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:29,290
- Well, there's something
in the holding cell

685
00:20:29,323 --> 00:20:32,393
that might cheer you up.

686
00:20:32,426 --> 00:20:33,394
- That's Nick's assistant.

687
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:34,395
Why is she here?

688
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:35,562
- After you left last night,

689
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,398
I was thinking about
the 24-hour sex painting,

690
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:39,600
"Genevieve 416."

691
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:40,934
Check out the date
on this receipt

692
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,370
from the storage locker
with the stolen art.

693
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:44,438
- April 16th.

694
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:46,139
416!
- Exactly.

695
00:20:46,172 --> 00:20:47,173
She couldn't have rented it,

696
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,476
because she was busy
getting busy.

697
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,477
- Oh, good one.

698
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:51,712
This is fantastic.

699
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:52,746
I mean, I'm not happy

700
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:54,214
that she was having sex
with another man,

701
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:55,782
but I'm okay with it
if that's what gets her off.

702
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,083
- Do you seriously
not hear it,

703
00:20:57,117 --> 00:20:58,485
because it almost seems
intentional at this point.

704
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,787
- Why would Dvora
set Genevieve up?

705
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:02,222
- Because she's
in love with Nick.

706
00:21:02,323 --> 00:21:04,691
She used one of those
latex casts of Genevieve's hand

707
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:05,692
to get the fingerprints

708
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:06,927
so she could
break into the gallery.

709
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,762
- Wow, I can't believe
you kept working the case

710
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:10,431
even after I gave up.

711
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,598
That was a nice thing to do.

712
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:14,635
- Charles, I didn't
do it to be nice.

713
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:16,737
I did it to be amazing.

714
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,938
And I think you're
a great detective,

715
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:19,340
and I trusted your gut.

716
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,741
Go get your girlfriend
out of prison.

717
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:22,242
- Oh, thanks, man.

718
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:24,345
Next time you see me,
I'm gonna be all out of orgasms.

719
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,447
- No, you can't say that
while you're hugging someone.

720
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:29,783
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
