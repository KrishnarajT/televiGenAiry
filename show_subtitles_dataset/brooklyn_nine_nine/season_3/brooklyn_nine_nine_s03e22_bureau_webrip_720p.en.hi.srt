Just a pocketful of lint.

1 centimeter in diameter.

both of those shows with him.

Totally get it.

519
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,703
I'll keep my hands to myself.

520
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,172
- What's going on, Sarge?
You find that leak yet?

521
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:04,875
- Yes. I'm hiding behind a
coffeemaker, spying on everyone

522
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:06,777
in this office,
because I found the leak.

523
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:09,680
- Aww, Terry. Sarcasm is not
a good look on you.

524
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,347
But you know what would be?

525
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:14,417
A really tight Henley.
- Very helpful.

526
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,852
- I know who your leak is.

527
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:17,353
- What?

528
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,522
- I looked up the reporter
who published the crime numbers,

529
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:21,925
and I noticed you two
follow each other online.

530
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,927
- He followed me,
and you know I'm

531
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,429
a proud member
of team follow-back.

532
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:27,698
- So I went through your feed

533
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:28,932
to see what
you were posting.

534
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:31,802
Lot of pictures of your kids.
Nobody cares.

535
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:34,871
And then I found this picture
you posted last week.

536
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:37,808
"Living that #YOGURT life."

537
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,575
[laughs] Embarrassing.

538
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,778
But what's even
more embarrassing, Terry,

539
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:46,249
is that the arrest numbers
are in the photo, clear as day.

540
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:47,984
- Oh, my God!

541
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,586
I was the leak!

542
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,788
I got to take that picture down.

543
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:54,725
Gina, I am so sorry
I blamed you.

544
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,960
- And I knew you would
say something like that,

545
00:19:56,993 --> 00:19:58,762
so I went ahead
and bought myself a cake

546
00:19:58,795 --> 00:19:59,896
on your behalf.

547
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,998
Check it out.

548
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:03,499
- Oh, dang.

549
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,902
- And this has been here for the
last half-hour, detective.

550
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:07,470
Didn't even notice it.

551
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:10,240
God, I'm so sick of doing
everyone's job for them.

552
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:12,275
It's like, help me out
a little bit.

553
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:14,344
Just once in a blue moon.

554
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,946
- Well, we did it.

555
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:16,947
For a second there,
I didn't think

556
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,248
we were going to pull it off.

557
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:20,951
- I knew we could.
- And we did. To us!

558
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,352
- Oh. What are
you guys celebrating?

559
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:23,820
- Terry was mad at us,
but we didn't know

560
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:25,822
what he was talking about,
and he went away.

561
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:28,024
- Huge day.
- Uh-huh.

562
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:31,294
[cell phone chiming]
It's Amy.

563
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:32,662
- Hey, girlfriend.

564
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:33,997
- Jake, Maury told me

565
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,832
who Figgis has working
for him in the FBI.

566
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,133
- Yeah,
I already know who it is,

567
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,802
because I just caught him:

568
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:40,303
Special Agent Ryan Whealon.

569
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,472
Also, I did one full pull-up.

570
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:44,040
I'm gonna be so buff
when you get back.

571
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:46,042
- Cool, babe.
Did you get the other guy?

572
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,812
- What other guy?
- Someone named Bob Anderson.

573
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:49,880
[dramatic music]

574
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:51,948
- Bob?

575
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:53,116
Oh, my God.

576
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,618
Amy, I have to go.

577
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:57,954
Bob is working for Figgis.
- What?

578
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:59,956
- He must've been the one who
deleted all those digital files.

579
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,224
And he tried to have
Whealon killed.

580
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:02,525
- But he helped us
with the heist,

581
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:03,960
and there was nothing about him
in the paper file.

582
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:06,029
- Yeah, because that wasn't
the real file.

583
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:07,230
[radio static]

584
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:10,266
- I just need to put
my return address on it.

585
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,103
And... there you go.

586
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:14,637
- Oh, thank you.
[radio static]

587
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:15,906
- We have to call Holt.

588
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:18,641
[phone line trilling]

589
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,244
Come on, Captain.
Pick up. Pick up.

590
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:24,480
[phone chiming]

591
00:21:24,547 --> 00:21:27,083
- Don't answer that,
Raymond.

592
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:29,652
And now I'm going
to have to kill you.

593
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,888
- Oh, Bob.

594
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:33,957
- Fremulon.

595
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,992
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
