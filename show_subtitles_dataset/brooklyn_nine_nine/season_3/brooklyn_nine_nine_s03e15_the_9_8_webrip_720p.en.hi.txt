disqualified.

- Whoo!

179
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,436
- Yeah, we say "noice,"
not "swurt."

180
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,372
Look, I'm so sorry,
but I don't think there's room

181

182
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,275
Jake, we should work it solo.

183
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,042
- Whoa, hang on that, Boyle.
Let's not be hasty.

184
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,044
I mean, Stevie's been tracking
Ozerov longer than we have.

185
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,280
And three heads are better
than two.

186
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,914
- Three's a crowd.
Everybody knows that.

187
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,349
What about in "The Lion King,"
huh?

188
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,451
When Jamone and Purboy became
friends with Steemba.

189
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,519
- That's not the names.

00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,687
It's Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa,

191
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,054
but I appreciate you trying.

192
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,690
Really is a perfect analogy.

All right, I'm in.

I think we should

We need information.

If we bust in there and Ozerov
doesn't have any drugs,

00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,317
and spacious.

350
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,754
This could be our new beginning.

351
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,024
- All right.

352
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,593
Can't let Ozerov
ditch the drugs.

353
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:34,260
We got to go in
fast and strong.

354
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,296
- I don't know about you,
but I can use some adrenalin.

355
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,430
A little slap-slap-boom?

356
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,999
- Mm.
- What's slap-slap-boom?

357
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,366
- Oh, it's just this thing
we used to do

358
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,268
to get each other pumped up
where we slap each other

359
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,970
in the face;
you don't have to do it.

360
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,438
- No, I want to.
I want to go first.

361
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,439
[slaps]
Ow!

362
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,708
[slaps]
Ooh! Ooh!

363
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:49,275
- Shh.
There's movement.

364
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,144
- But I'm the only one
who got slapped in the face.

365
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,513
- Charles, we gotta go!

366
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:56,116
NYPD!
Show me your hands!

367
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,620
- Hey, Ozerov, I'll have
a martini with a twist.

368
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,022
The twist?
You're under arrest.

369
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,624
- None for me;
I'm driving...

370
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,058
you to jail.

371
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,860
- He's clean.
There's no drugs on him.

372
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:07,961
- Damn it.

373
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:10,096
We wasted those
cool lines on nothing.

374
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,264
Also, we blew the case.

375
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,432
That's obviously much worse.

376
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,466
That was my first thought.

377
00:12:17,638 --> 00:12:19,139
but I still think
it was worth the risk.

378
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,642
- Well, I think it was
a crap circus.

379
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:23,744
This whole operation
is blown.

380
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,779
If you ask me,
the Beatsie Boys

381
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:26,780
should be called

382
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,282
the Thoroughly
Messed-Up Millies.

383
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,984
- What?
- I can't even imagine

384
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:31,985
what you're going for.

385
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,553
- I was being devastating!

386
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,255
- Look, man,
I get that you're pissed,

387
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,090
but I am telling you,
Ozerov is dirty.

388
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,759
- Maybe, but if we had staked
the bar out,

389
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,961
we could've built up cases
against a dozen guys here.

390
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,663
This place is filled
with criminals.

391
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,130
I brought him in last month.

392
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:45,966
- Hey, Detective Boyle.
- Hi, Isaac.

393
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,168
The only good thing is,
now this whole trio

394
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,770
doesn't have to
work together anymore.

395
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,672
- Yes it does.
Charles, you did it.

396
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:53,807
You saved the case.
- What? Why? I didn't want to.

397
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,109
- Correct me if I'm wrong,
but consorting with known felons

398
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,577
is a parole violation,
meaning

399
00:12:57,678 --> 00:12:59,980
we have grounds to search
Ozerov's home.

400
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:03,216
- Hell yeah!
Jakey P with the save!

401
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,885
- Well, you know, Boyle
is the one who pointed it out.

402
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,552
He deserves the credit.
- True, true, true.

403
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:07,553
Good job, Earl!

404
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,155
- You know my name is Charles.

405
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,560
- So, if we're gonna start
a secret office on the roof,

406
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:15,762
we need equipment.

407
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,699
That means chairs, desks,
printers, pens.

408
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:19,900
But we gotta sneak it out,

409
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:21,501
so we need a distraction.

410
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,003
- Okay, here is
what I'm thinking.

411
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,038
We give that dog
a bunch of chocolates.

412
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,039
It dies.

413
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,207
While everyone celebrates—

414
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,574
- Okay, Amy's
too close to this.

415
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:30,510
Rosa, you got any ideas?

416
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,713
- Hitchcock and Scully just set
fire to the kitchen sink.

417
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:35,515
- Oh, boy.
Ooh, boy.

418
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,717
- Perfect!

419
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,885
Let's use that.

420
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,854
- I looked everywhere.
I didn't find anything.

421
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,122
Did you?
- No.

422
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,557
But mirror top coffee table,

423
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,793
iguana cage,
samurai swords on the wall—

424
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,094
either this guy is a drug dealer

425
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,030
or uses an incautious
interior designer.

426
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:51,865
- He might be a drug dealer,
but we have nothing on him.

427
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,099
- Quick question, guys.

428
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:56,236
Why did the drug dealer never do
his dishes?

429
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,105
Because he has drugs
in his dishwasher.

430
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,106
- Oh, yeah!

431
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,374
- Dishwasher?
- Hit me.

432
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,776
- Here, is for you.

433
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,110
- Hello?
- Hey.

434
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,445
- What's up, dude?
It's me.

435
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,880
- We got the drugs, man.

436
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,815
- Hang on,
Charles wants to say hi.

437
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,952
- Do you have any milk?

438
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,887
- Not a stranger in sight.

439
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,121
It's beautiful.

440
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,290
- I've never heard the printer
sound so happy.

441
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,624
I feel like it knows.

442
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:19,625
- We did it.

443
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,661
A new world.

444
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:24,364
This must be how
the founding fathers felt.

445
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,767
- So...

446
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,068
what are you doing out here?

447
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,970
- Captain, it's mayhem in there.

448
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,338
Those people are messy
and selfish.

449
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,406
- And chatty.
- And out here,

450
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,908
we can actually get work done.

451
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,576
- But—
- Sir, I'll handle this.

452
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,577
We love it.

453
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,578
We're proud of you.

454
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,046
We want in.
- No.

455
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,315
You're acting like little
children playing basketball

456
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,085
who've fallen behind by several
two-pointer buckets

457
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,253
so you just take
your basket home,

458
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,055
and now no one else can play.

459
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,258
- I know it's not the time,
but you gotta watch basketball

460
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,526
if you're gonna try
to reference it.

461
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,061
- Sergeant,
this is boorish behavior.

462
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,797
I wanted you to be a good host.

463
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,998
- You told me to make it work,

464
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,866
and I came up
with a creative solution.

465
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,968
Diaz finished
her arrest reports.

466
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,304
Santiago did the filing
of ten men.

467
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,505
- I don't
want to hear it.

468
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,943
Just clean up this mess
and get back inside.

469
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,412
[printer beeping]

470
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,314
- Paper jam.

471
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,149
It does know.

472
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,451
- Attenzione, dingbats.

473
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,154
Perchance a riddle.
Shakespeare.

474
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,624
What has six thumbs
and just arrested a drug dealer?

475
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,492
both: These guys.

476
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,660
- [chuckles]

477
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,429
- Charles, thumbs up.

478
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,131
I said "six thumbs"
and we're only showing four.

479
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,265
We're starting
to look like fools.

480
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,299
- Come on, Charles.

481
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,367
- There it is.

482
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,701
That's the ticket.
- Whoo!

483
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:37,337
- All right, man, I'm gonna go
check in with Flynt.

484
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,505
You do some research on where
we're gonna celebrate tonight.

485
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,874
Here's my only requirement:

486
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,609
it has to be at your house
'cause I ain't got no money.

487
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,378
- Uh, okay,
how about at my house?

488
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,512
- Swurt.

489
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,648
[both laughing]

490
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,116
- Yes!

491
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,151
[sighs]

492
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,485
- Psst, hey.

493
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,486
- What are you doing?

494
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,520
- Come here.

495
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,190
- What?

496
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,859
- I think Stevie's
bad news.

497
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,861
- What?
Oh, come on, Charles.

498
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:03,129
You know, you've been acting
weird about Stevie all day.

499
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:04,764
I think you might be jealous.

500
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:05,866
- Of course I'm jealous.

501
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,067
I was never hiding that.

502
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,634
- How?
- He's tall. He's funny.

503
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,735
He can pull off an earring.

504
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:10,904
- He doesn't have an earring.

505
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,372
- But we both know
he'd look good with one.

506
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,240
- Oh, my God—What do you
want me to say, Boyle?

507
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,542
I've been trying to include you
in this all day long.

508
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,079
And, yes, I forgot you
that one time,

509
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,080
but I made up for it.

510
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,481
I slapped you in the face.

511
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,883
- You're supposed to be
my friend.

512
00:16:22,883 --> 00:16:24,750
- I'm an adult man,
I can have two close friends.

513
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,252
Hell, I can have
three close friends.

514
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,921
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

515
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,055
- [scoffs]
- Maybe I'll get in touch

516
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:30,423
with my friend James
from college.

517
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,958
Ooh, or you know who just
looked me up online?

518
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:32,959
Brad from camp.

519
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,895
- Stevie planted the drugs.

520
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,462
- Come on!

521
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,932
- I looked on that dishwasher
before him, and it was empty.

522
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,433
Stevie planted those pills.

523
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,635
But you're right,
he's the coolest!

524
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,770
You guys should go get
your ears pierced together.

525
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,772
Invite Brad.
It'll be smurt.

526
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,410
- It's swurt, not smurt.

527
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,745
So, joke it's on you.

528
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:53,779
Damn it, Stevie!

529
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,485
You know what that means.
It's time to celebrate.

530
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,922
You know what that means.
Let's eat big sandwiches!

531
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:03,056
- I gotta talk to you...

532
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,490
in private.

533
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,959
Come on.

534
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,762
- Okay.

535
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,632
Uh, this is cozy.

536
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,000
- Well, the precinct
is so crowded,

537
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,969
this is the only place
no one can hear us talk.

538
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,938
[deep breath]
Listen.

539
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,340
I know you planted the drugs
at Ozerov's place.

540
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,407
- What?

541
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,675
- Charles checked
the dishwasher,

542
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,010
and he didn't
see any drugs.

543
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,278
- Yeah, well, they were there.
All right?

544
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,746
I guess he just missed them.

545
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,982
Probably busy hiking up his
pants above this belly button.

546
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,516
- He has to do that
because they don't make pants

547
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,851
short enough for him.

548
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:33,954
Look.
Don't lie to me, man.

549
00:17:33,954 --> 00:17:36,689
- Dude, the guy
is a drug dealer.

550
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:37,823
All right?

551
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,259
I wasn't gonna
let him walk again.

552
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,460
But you get it,
though, right?

553
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:41,995
You're not a tight-ass
like Charles.

554
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,363
- You know, I wish
I was like Charles.

555
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,165
He's a good cop
and an honest person,

556
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,968
and when we go on stakeouts,
we do listen to Toni Braxton

557
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:50,470
and it's super sad
and it's awesome.

558
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,038
I can't believe
I'm saying this, Stevie,

559
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,873
but I gotta report you.

560
00:17:53,974 --> 00:17:55,508
Ow!

561
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,177
Did you just Donkey Kong
punch me?

562
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,811
- There's no room
to regular punch you.

563
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:03,449
[both grunting]

564
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:04,550
- Ooh, all right.

565
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,551
It's on.

566
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,852
- Ahh!
- What's going on?

567
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:08,054
- He did plant the drugs.

568
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,089
- You trusted me.

569
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,256
- Oww!

570
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,757
- Son of a bitch!
I hope there's room

571
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,726
in this fight for three.
- There's not.

572
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:21,701
- You have a 2:30 meeting
with small head big body.

573
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,203
I forgot to take his name.

574
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,570
- D.A. Brayburn.

575
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,072
Deputy Inspector Flynt,

576
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,707
do you mind if we have
a meeting here in the office?

577
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,874
- Actually, I do mind.

578
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,476
I'm not really in the mood
for company.

579
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:33,146
I just had a bad loss
in an online poker game.

580
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,280
- Of course.

581
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,581
Anything for our guests.

582
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,283
- Get back here,
you crap basket.

583
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,284
You're going down!

584
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,385
- Help!

585
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,820
He's attacking me
for no reason!

586
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,222
[both grunt, all gasp]

587
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,757
- Stevie Schillens,
you have the right to remain...

588
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,026
- A loser.
- Noice.

589
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,028
But, now legally,
I have to start over, Charles.

590
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:49,429
- Stevie Schill—Oh!

591
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,496
[all gasp]

592
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,032
- Get off him.
We just made up.

593
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:54,234
[grunting]

594
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,335
Paul?

595
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,636
I thought we had something.

596
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,770
- [grunts]

597
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,771
- Get nine-eight.

598
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,939
[all chattering]

599
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,642
- Hope your dog
will help with neck pain.

600
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,077
- Oh!
She doesn't help with any pain.

601
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,178
I made it up.

602
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,579
- Ha!
I knew it!

603
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,913
- Hey, Ellen.

604
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,315
I got your farm girl.

605
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,350
- You wouldn't.

606
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,253
Bessy!

607
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,188
- Terry got his computer back.

608
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,057
[grunts]

609
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,559
Oh, come on!

610
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,595
[yelling and groaning]

611
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,067
- Sarge, take off your shirt!

612
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:29,502
It's restricting your movement.

613
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,406
[bullhorn blares]

614
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,608
- What the hell
is going on here?

615
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,077
- Yeah.

616
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,212
What are you guys doing?

617
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,847
- Brawling with other
police officers?

618
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:42,882
What were you thinking?

619
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,185
- Sir, I had nothing
to do with this.

620
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,253
I was arresting a dirty cop.

621
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,789
- I heard you scream out
"I love this!"

622
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,956
- Yes.

623
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,293
"This" being justice.

624
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,294
I love justice.

625
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,861
- And to make matters worse,

626
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:59,732
our radiator was broken during
your wild street-ball scrum.

627
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,467
So now we have no heat.

628
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,236
Which means we'll have to work
in the freezing cold,

629
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,704
and our guests
from the nine-eight

630
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:07,807
will have to relocate again.

631
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,775
No smiles.
No smiles.

632
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,477
This is a sad day
for our precinct.

633
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,645
Dismissed.

634
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,115
[all grumbling]

635
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:16,649
- Captain.

636
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,118
You know what's
kinda weird?

637
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,586
There was no one was fighting
over by the radiator.

638
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,256
You were the only person
standing near it.

639
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,993
- I suppose, in the hubbub,

640
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,563
I may have tripped
and busted a pipe.

641
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:31,564
[all yelling, metallic clank]

[steam hissing]

643
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,969
- I knew it!

644
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,339
I knew you couldn't stand
having someone in your space.

645
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,673
- He used my letter opener

646
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,642
to cut his tuna sandwich
in half!

647
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,477
You were right.

648
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,312
They were disrespectful
and had to go.

649
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,181
And, yes, sometimes
you have to come up

650
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,982
with a creative solution.

651
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,585

of dudes need to get into a room

652
