00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,685
Nobody wants you turning
into another Terry.

179
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:15,887
Ugh.

180
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:18,055
- Hey, people like
the way that I look.

181
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:20,257
- Sure they do,
big guy.

182
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,625
Look, I can't believe
you're gonna take

183
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:23,660
some fitness floozy
to Bouche Manger.

184
00:06:23,694 --> 00:06:24,896
You should be going
with Amy.

185
00:06:24,896 --> 00:06:25,997
Right, Amy?

186
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,398
- Uh...
[scoffs]

187
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:28,765
Whatever, dog.

188
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,267
Date the flooze.

189
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:31,402
- See?

190
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:33,570
It's never gonna happen,
Boyle, okay?

191
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:35,772
Because I find Amy repulsive,

192
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:38,375
and she finds me
extremely handsome.

193
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,911
So stop pressuring us.

194
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:41,913
- Oh, you sweet,
naive boy.

195
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:44,381
I haven't even begun
to pressure you two.

196
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:46,050
I've already written
my best man speech

197
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,752
for your wedding.

198
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,621
Oh, I'm gonna need you
to get married on a farm.

199
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:53,257
A lot of my jokes
rely on that.

200
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,693
- So here we are,

201
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,295
officially on a date,

202
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,596
romantical date.

203
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,432
- Yes, we are.

204
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,534
No longer
just colleagues.

205
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,836
Dating.

206
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:07,838
You got a haircut.
It looks nice.

207
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:09,340
- Oh, thanks.

208
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:10,707
You also got a haircut

209
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,543
at some point in your life.

210
00:07:12,576 --> 00:07:13,945
I'm sure that's not
your baby hair.

211
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:15,012
That would be crazy.

212
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:16,347
- [chuckles]
- But, uh...

213
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,848
Yeah, you look very nice.

214
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,951
- Domo arigato.

215
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:20,985
- Do you speak Japanese?

216
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:22,719
- No.
- Oh.

217
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:24,855
Uh... sorry.

218
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,524
I think I'm feeling
a little awkward.

219
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:29,560
- Yeah, me too.

220
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:31,062
- How do we make it
not weird?

221
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,997
- I know.

222
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,398
Let's just get
super drunk.

223
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:35,699
- Yes, great idea.

224
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:36,800
Pardon me, ma'am.

225
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,735
Could you please bring us
four kamikaze shots?

226
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:39,971
- And four for me
as well.

227
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:41,605
- Ah, I like your style.

228
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:43,074
See, we can do this.

229
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:44,175
We're back on track.

230
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,843
We're keeping it
light and breezy.

231
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:50,647
So we broke a rule.

232
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:51,782
- Yeah.

233
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:53,650
I hope it wasn't
a mistake.

234
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:55,752
- "I Hope It Wasn't a Mistake,"
title of your sex tape?

235
00:07:55,786 --> 00:07:58,522
[gasps]
Title of our sex tape.

236
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,362
We are not leaving these seats
until you give me some deets.

237
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:07,764
- All right, fine.

238
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,400
It started off
a bit rocky,

239
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,902
but it ended up
being really fun.

240
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,237
- Did you kiss?

241
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,505
Did you french?

242
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:16,173
- Boyle, I'm not
gonna answer that.

243
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:18,509
And no one over the age
of 12 says "french."

244
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,345
- Oh, that's a yes.
Oh, my God, you had sex.

245
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:22,346
[grunts]

246
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:23,614
I can tell because
you're glowing.

247
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:26,683
Ugh, Jake, no one wants
to hear about your sex life.

248
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,419
- You just asked me
repeatedly.

249
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:30,154
- Because I was rooting
for you and Amy,

250
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:32,089
but now I can see
you're super serious

251
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:34,658
about this anonymous
gym seductress.

252
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:36,593
Ugh, I'm so sorry, Amy.

253
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:37,928
- It doesn't matter to me.

254
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,496
I'm—I would never date Jake.

255
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,797
I work with Jake.

256
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:42,199
- I'd love to see you
date someone from work.

257
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,434
Your head would explode.

258
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,402
- Your head would explode...

259
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:47,871
because of how well
I would handle it.

260
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,640
- Mm. Sick burn.

261
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:52,176
- Peralta, Dozerman says
he wants to see you.

262
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:54,678
- Captain,
everything all right?

263
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:57,714
[tapping]

264
00:09:00,617 --> 00:09:01,585
- You tell me.

265
00:09:01,618 --> 00:09:03,154
According
to your Dozer-pad,

266
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:05,456
four of your coworkers have
been gathered around your desk

267
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:06,690
for the last 90 seconds.

268
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,725
Also, someone named
Norm Scully

269
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,761
has been in the bathroom
for the last 72 minutes.

270
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:13,064
- Oh, yeah, that means
he's about halfway.

271
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:14,598
But in regards
to the coworkers, sir,

272
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:17,368
I was telling them I wanted
to get more work done,

273
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,803
but all they wanted to do
was talk about my dating life,

274
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:22,273
knowing full well
that my true love

275
00:09:22,306 --> 00:09:23,707
is efficiency.

276
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,342
You know my motto, sir.

277
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:27,444
Cho's before hos.

278
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:28,912
"Cho's" is "chores."

279
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:32,616
What?

280
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:35,686
- I like you.

281
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,154
I could tell from
the moment I walked in here

282
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:38,655
that we were one
and the same—

283
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:41,358
detail-oriented,
love crunching numbers.

284
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:42,759
Bet your apartment's
immaculate.

285
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:43,927
Could probably eat
off the floor.

286
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,230
- And I do. Yeah.
- Yeah.

287
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:49,133
I'm gonna handle this for you.
- Okay.

288
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:53,104
- I'm gonna send out
a Dozerblast.

289
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:57,007
Hey, everyone stop talking
about Peralta's personal life.

290
00:09:57,108 --> 00:10:00,577
Dozerblast over.

291
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:02,746
- Well, thank you
very much, sir,

292
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:06,083
and might I just say that
this has been a Dozerblast.

293
00:10:06,117 --> 00:10:07,451
- I saw what you did
right there.

294
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:08,452
- Uh?

295
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:11,488
[both laughing]

296
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:14,791
- Get back to work.
- Okay.

297
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,160
- I know you've been working

298
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,061
on picking a name
for the pigeon mascot

299
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,863
for, uh...
[laughs]

300
00:10:19,896 --> 00:10:21,165
Several months now.

301
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:22,699
I feel like you might
need a breather,

302
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:25,536
so I've prepared
an eight-point presentation

303
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:27,238
on community engagement.

304
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,072
- We'll get to your
presentation, Raymond.

305
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,241
It's on the agenda.

306
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:32,209
- Well, it says here
it's scheduled

307
00:10:32,243 --> 00:10:33,877
"after everyone leaves."

308
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,945
- And not a minute later.

309
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:36,847
Trent, Bryce, where
are we with the name?

310
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,982
- We've narrowed it down
to two choices—

311
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:40,617
Petey or Paulie.

312
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:42,253
- With all due respect,

313
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:44,721
that pigeon is
clearly a Ray J.

314
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:46,590
Hi.
Gina Linetti,

315
00:10:46,623 --> 00:10:49,726
the human form
of the 100 emoji.

316
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,862
- I'd like to hear Captain
Holt's thoughts on a name.

317
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:54,198
- Very well.
My thoughts are...

318
00:10:54,231 --> 00:10:55,232
who cares?

319
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:57,000
- Give us a name,
Raymond.

320
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,034
Weigh in on this.

321
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,069
It's your job now.

322
00:10:59,102 --> 00:11:00,737
- No.

323
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:02,339
- A name.

324
00:11:02,373 --> 00:11:03,907
Petey or Paulie,
which is it?

325
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,075
- What does it matter?

326
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:06,310
Why'd you even choose
a pigeon anyway?

327
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:07,544
It's a terrible mascot.

328
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:08,945
- Because they're
a staple of New York,

329
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:10,781
they're nonthreatening,
and they're everywhere.

330
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:12,048
- They're carriers of disease,

331
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:13,884
and they eat garbage!

332
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:15,319
- Name the pigeon,
Raymond!

333
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:17,854
- You can't make me.
- I can make you, and I will.

334
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:20,023
Name the pigeon.
That's an order!

335
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,498
- Paulie.

336
00:11:27,531 --> 00:11:28,565
- Thank you.

337
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,600
Was that so hard?

338
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,668
- [sighs]

339
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:33,470
- Yeah, I'm trying
to find some evidence.

340
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:35,239
I'm just gonna
look in here.

341
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:37,073
Another perfect cover.
Two for two. Nailed it.

342
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:38,575
All right,
I talked to Dozerman

343
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,877
and convinced him to outlaw
all personal talk at work.

344
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:41,912
We're in the clear.

345
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:43,247
- And everyone
hates you for that,

346
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,982
but this is totally working,
and no one knows.

347
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:47,318
- I know.
It's the best.

348
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:48,719
And you know what?
I'm glad we broke the rule

349
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:50,053
and had sex
on the first date.

350
00:11:50,086 --> 00:11:52,456
- Me too, 'cause we're,
like, really good at it.

351
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,258
- So good, right?
- Stupid good.

352
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,559
- It makes no sense.
- [gasps]

353
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:56,860
- We're light
and breezy.

and die holding each other

530
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:49,946
as your cruise ship
slowly takes on water.

531
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,047
- What do you
want me to say?

532
00:17:51,081 --> 00:17:52,583
We tried really hard.
We made rules.

533
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,817
We kept it light
and breezy.

534
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,985
- Light and breezy?

535
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:56,186
- Ow!

536
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:57,487
- Light and breezy
is how you describe

537
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:58,755
a linen pantsuit,

538
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,857
not a relationship
you care about.

539
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:02,492
- We were just
being cautious.

540
00:18:02,593 --> 00:18:04,360
- Cautious?
- Ow!

541
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:06,597
- You guys started this
with one foot out the door.

542
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,498
That's what doomed you,
not the universe.

543
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,066
- Actually, it makes
a lot of sense.

544
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,603
Ow, I was agreeing
with you!

545
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:13,604
- I'm sorry.

546
00:18:13,637 --> 00:18:14,905
I'm just so excited
about all this!

547
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:16,372
- All right,
so what do I do?

548
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:17,741
Tell me.
- Easy.

549
00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:19,943
You march over there,
you tell her how you feel,

550
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:21,612
and you bring a fancy bottle
of lavender shampoo,

551
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:22,846
because shampooing
a woman's head

552
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:24,615
is the most erotic thing
you could ever possibly—

553
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,049
- No, no, no shampoo.
That's the worst.

554
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:27,618
But I am gonna
go over there.

555
00:18:27,618 --> 00:18:28,785
I'm gonna tell her
how I feel.

556
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:29,853
- Yes!
Go get her.

557
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,888
No!
Wait till it starts raining.

558
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,356
No, that's crazy.
Go now.

559
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:34,958
- Okay.

560
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:38,494
Ahh!
- Sorry! Sorry.

561
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:39,930
- It's okay.

562
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:41,531
- I was home,

563
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:44,134
and I really wanted
to talk to someone about us

564
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,102
and Dozerman
and about Holt being gone,

565
00:18:46,136 --> 00:18:48,672
and then I realized
that the only person

566
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:51,642
I want to talk about that
stuff with is you.

567
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:54,911
So screw just being
colleagues,

568
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:57,480
and screw light
and breezy, right?

569
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:59,382
- [sighs]

570
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:00,416
Definitely.

571
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:03,153
- Guys, we did it.

572
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:04,154
We really did it.

573
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,489
- Oh, Charles is here.

574
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:07,523
- Big time.

575
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:08,792
[bell ringing]

576
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:10,026
- Captain.

577
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,195
The kids want to know
where Paulie the Pigeon is.

578
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:14,230
I told 'em he got sucked up
into an airplane engine.

579
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:15,465
Is that all right?

580
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:17,768
- I can't put that
pigeon head on, Gina.

581
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:19,903
Wuntch has defeated me.

582
00:19:19,936 --> 00:19:21,137
This is how it ends,

583
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:22,873
with me standing on
the urine-soaked floor

584
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:24,207
of an elementary
school bathroom

585
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,143
in a third-rate
bird costume.

586
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:28,578
I quit.
- No.

587
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,414
I did not follow you to PR
to watch you quit.

588
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:33,717
I followed you
because you're great

589
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,519
and because you make
everything you touch better,

590
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,555
and I figured PR
would be the easiest path

591
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:42,392
to launching my reality show
"Linetti, Set, Go."

592
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,227
- I thought your reality
show was to be called

593
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,495
"Gina in a Bottle."

594
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:47,698
- No, that was
my fragrance line.

595
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:48,932
Keep up.

596
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,266
Listen.

597
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,703
You cannot let Wuntch
defeat you.

598
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:54,370
That is not who you are.

599
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:56,206
You are a person
who will go out there

600
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:59,109
and deliver his eight-point plan
on whatever, whatever.

601
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:00,977
- Community engagement.
- Whatever.

602
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:03,413
Even if the only
people listening

603
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,348
are a bunch of second graders,

604
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:08,418
because Captain Raymond Holt

605
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:10,854
never gives up!

606
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:12,222
- Inspiring words.

607
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,024
I'm going to give
that speech.

608
00:20:14,057 --> 00:20:16,860
Help me with that
pigeon head.

609
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:19,062
- Yeah, all right.

610
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:23,566
- Let's blow some tiny minds.

611
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:25,201
[electronic chime]

612
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:28,371
Dozerman: Rosa Diaz, you are
six hours ahead of schedule.

613
00:20:28,404 --> 00:20:29,973
Great job.

614
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:31,507
- Wow, Diaz.

615
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,576
That's the first time
I've seen him smile.

616
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:34,644
- I didn't do it for him.

617
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:36,079
I did it 'cause it's my job.

618
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:38,214
We cool?
- We're cool.

619
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:40,751
- Good.

620
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:41,952
[banging]

621
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:43,854
Dozerman: Damage.
Critical damage.

622
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:47,924
[electronic beeping]

623
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,293
- There's a rumor the new
captain'll be here today.

624
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:52,996
Now, I don't know
who Wuntch is sending us,

625
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:54,664
but it doesn't matter,

626
00:20:54,697 --> 00:20:56,366
because we're a family,

627
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:57,600
we're strong,

628
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,003
and together,
we can do anything.

629
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:02,238
Nine-Nine!
all: Nine-Nine!

630
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:04,875
[funky music]

631
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:06,777
- What's up, ding-dongs?

632
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:07,878
I'm your new captain.

633
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:09,545
- The Vulture.
- No.

634
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:10,580
- Still hot.

635
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:12,215
- Now, I know we have
our history,

636
00:21:12,248 --> 00:21:14,150
me vulturing your cases,

637
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:16,086
me telling you
to eat my farts,

638
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,220
but that's all in the past,

639
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:18,989
'cause now that I run
this precinct,

640
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:22,959
things are gonna get
much, much worse.

641
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:24,594
So suck it.

642
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:27,263
- No!

643
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:29,232
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
