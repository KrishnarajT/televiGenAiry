1
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:02,286
- Attention, everyone!

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:04,989
Say good-bye to the Jake Peralta
you know and love,

3
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:07,692
for today is the day
I forever change.

4
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:09,494
- Ooh, are you finally
growing a mustache?

5
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:10,795
- No, you know
I can't do that,

6
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:12,564
and it's cruel of you
to keep bringing it up.

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,032
This envelope contains the
inheritance my uncle left me.

8
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:17,301
He died a year ago;
he was so rich,

9
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,336
he had a whole room
in his house just to eat in.

10
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,805
- You mean like
a dining room?

11
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:22,874
- Yeah, but in Manhattan.
- Oh, dang.

12
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:24,742
- Now, just because
I'm definitely rich now

13
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:26,410
doesn't mean I'm gonna
forget my roots.

14
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:28,480
You all get something,
so fire away.

15
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,815
- Jake, your friendship
is gift enough for me.

16
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:33,217
- Friendship is crap.
I want a Ducati Monster 821.

17
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,986
- All right,
Rosa gets a motorcycle.

18
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:36,921
- Oh, cool.
I want a fast sports car.

19
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:38,355
- Come on.
You can be honest.

20
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,057
- I want old, expensive books.
I'll send you a list.

21
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:41,158
- There you go.

22
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,928
Now, let's find out
what I'm worth.

23
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:45,997
Oh, I'm too nervous to open it.
Sarge, you do it.

24
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,599
- Okay.

25
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,537
It's stock.
One million shares!

26
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,005
- Oh, my God!

27
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:55,940
- Of Blockbuster Video stock.

28
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:58,510
all: Ohh.
- What? Is that bad?

29
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:01,112
I still have
a Blockbuster card!

30
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,814
What happened to Blockbuster?

31
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:05,783
[upbeat music]

32
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:13,825

[funky music]

34
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,973
- Mapping, mapping,
mapping, mapping,

35
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,676
mapping, mapping.

36
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,210
- What's going on
there, buddy?

37
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:35,312
- Just making a final
imprint of your face

38
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,148
before the LASIK surgery
goes poorly

39
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,950
and my eyeballs
get burned off.

40
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:41,553
- Why stop at the eyes?
Burn off your whole head.

41
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:44,989
- Charles, the surgery
is going to go fine, all right?

42
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,858
You'll have some vision
impairment for a few hours,

43
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:48,192
and I'm gonna be with you
the whole time!

44
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:50,194
Plus, they're gonna give you
some of those sweet-ass

45
00:01:50,227 --> 00:01:51,696
Robocop sunglasses.

46
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,898
- Those are blind people
sunglasses.

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,034
- Captain.
What are you doing here?

48
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:59,003
Thought you took the day off
to pack for your big trip,

49
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,304
or did you finally realize

50
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,273
that it only takes
one minute to pack?

51
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:03,608
- Not if you care
about your possessions

52
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:05,109
and what the world sees
when they look at you.

53
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:06,811
- Huh.
- I'm not going.

54
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,379
Cheddar's regular
dog sitter is ill,

55
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:09,647
and the heat's out
in my house,

56
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:11,215
so I don't think
it's a good time for me

57
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:12,917
to visit Kevin in Paris.

58
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,052
- Sir, you can't
just cancel your trip.

59
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,054
You guys haven't seen
each other in months.

60
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:19,591
How about this:
Amy and I

61
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,392
will look after your house
while you're gone.

62
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:23,260
Right, Ames?
- Totally.

63
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:25,897
- I thought you two were
watching Ray Charles Boyle.

64
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,131
- Good point.

65
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:29,066
Charles can come with us
and look after Cheddar.

66
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,134
I'm told that blind people

67
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,769
have a special connection
with dogs.

68
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,905
- I knew it.
You do think I'm gonna go blind.

69
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:35,106
- That's an interesting offer,

70
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:36,407
but I don't want to be
an imposition.

71
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,510
- Pshaw!
Imposition? Pshaw!

72
00:02:39,611 --> 00:02:40,678
- No, I was talking
to Santiago.

73
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:42,079
I assume she'll be
doing all the work.

74
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:43,414
- Why?

75
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:44,949
Oh, because of our track records
and personalities.

76
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:46,283
Sure, sure, sure, sure, yeah.

77
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:48,686
- So, Santiago, are you sure
you're okay with this?

78
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:51,856
- I'm so in.
This is gonna be fantastic.

79
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:53,791
This is horrible!
We're not ready for this.

80
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,827
This is a level one
responsibility.

81
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,863
I'm a level two at best,
and you're not even a level!

82
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,331
- Well, I'm a level,
you know.

83
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:02,066
I'm probably, like,
a level five.

84
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,068
- Not a level.

85
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,536
- I thought
you'd be psyched.

86
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:06,938
I mean, a week
at Captain Holt's house?

87
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,640
Wasn't that where you wanted
to spend your honeymoon?

88
00:03:08,673 --> 00:03:10,374
- Yeah, but this
is too much pressure!

89
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,709
Why did you volunteer
us for this?

90
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:14,679
- Because Holt hasn't
seen Kevin in, like, months,

91
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:17,649
and I was just thinking
if that was me and you,

92
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:19,183
it would make me really sad.

93
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:23,020
- Oh.
That's actually super sweet.

94
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,722
- Plus, there's this
big, fat binder

95
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:26,523
full of instructions
and rules.

96
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:28,225
- There's a binder?

97
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,527
Why didn't you lead
with that, you idiot?

98
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:31,663
Oh!

99
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:33,030
- How about I just
leave you two alone?

100
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:34,966
- Okay.

101
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,868
- Diaz.

102
00:03:36,901 --> 00:03:37,902
- Pimento.

103
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:42,039
What's up?
- What's up with you?

104
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:44,475
I need you to sign this report.
- Okay.

105
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:45,910
I'll sign your report.

106
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,392
- Mm.

107
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,561
- What the hell?

108
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:07,131
- Mm.

109
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,703
- Careful.
The ink's still wet.

110
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:13,337
- Maybe this'll help.

111
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,248
- Okay, they got
to knock that off.

112
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:27,018
- Loosen up, Sarge.
- Summer of love, baby.

113
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:28,585
- It's March, man.
Shut up.

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,354
- It's true what they say.

115
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:31,723
Now that I'm fully
blind forever,

116
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:33,858
my other senses
are heightened.

117
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:35,592
I feel a door.
[gasps]

118
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:36,828
We're at Captain Holt's house.

119
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:38,863
- Also, the GPS announced it
when we pulled up.

120
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,064
Hey, once we're inside,

121
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:41,565
maybe keep your hands
to yourself, all right?

122
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:43,735
The captain can be very
particular about his stuff.

123
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:45,770
- Cheddar! Let go!
Let go of it!

124
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,372
- Amy?
- This is a cashmere sweater!

125
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:51,242
[sneezes]
Oh, my stupid allergies!

126
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,744
He got into Kevin's closet.

127
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:53,911
He was supposed
to stay downstairs.

128
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,546
The binder was very clear
about that.

129
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,081
Why won't you respect
the binder?

130
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:58,750
- Oh, no, he's turning
all the turtlenecks

131
00:04:58,783 --> 00:05:00,117
into regular necks.

132
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,753
Charles, you got to help us.
- On it.

133
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:04,155
Okay, the key with dogs
is establishing the alpha.

134
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:06,991
Cheddah, dwop it.
Pwease dwop it.

135
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:08,659
I'll give you
anything you want.

136
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,162
- Oh, Cheddar is the alpha.
Didn't expect that.

137
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:12,997
- Pwease, pwease, pwease.

138
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,365
- [sighs]

139
00:05:14,431 --> 00:05:16,000
- Nice job, Boyle.
It worked.

140
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:18,335
- But the mess, Jake.
The mess!

141
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,004
- Don't worry.
We're gonna clean it up.

142
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:22,306
Everything is totally
under control.

143
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,041
- Charles' pants are on fire.
- What?

144
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,143
Boyle, the space heater!
Get away from the space heater!

145
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:27,478
- I don't know where it is!
[smoke alarm beeping]

146
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,046
I'm just gonna run
at full speed!

147
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:30,782
- No!
- Aah!

148
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:32,149
- Charles, just stay
where you are!

149
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:33,284
I got it.

150
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:36,320
[grunting]

151
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:38,790
Whoo!
Okay.

152
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,157
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

153
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:42,559
Fire's out.
And this table isâ€”

154
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:44,028
- Oh!

155
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:45,897
- Fragile.
I was gonna say fragile.

156
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,799
Nailed it.
- Ah!

157
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,172
- You punching holes?

158
00:05:55,206 --> 00:05:57,174
- Yeah.
- That's way too much paper.

159
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,911
- Not for me.

160
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,813
- Can't even get
a cup of coffee.

161
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,883
- [grunts]

162
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,822
Well, I'm off to find
some yellow paper

163
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:16,293
so I can do this
all over again.

164
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,265
- All right, Diaz?
That's it.

165
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,499
What's going on
with you two?

166
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,301
- Oh, you noticed it?
- Yeah, I noticed it!

167
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:25,903
Everyone's noticed it!

168
00:06:25,937 --> 00:06:28,439
A convicted pervert asked me
if you guys could cool it.

169
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,441
- I don't know
what to tell you.

170
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,676
Something between us, Sarge.

171
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,578
Something dark and urgent.

172
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:36,914
- Ah.

173
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:38,449
Okay.
Great news.

174
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,451
The smell of burnt sweatpants
and singed leg hair

175
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,853
is finally dissipating.

176
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,687
- I just hope I can
grow it back by Speedo season.

177
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,156
[phone rings]

178
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,458
- Call from Raymond Holt,
mobile.

179
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:48,592
- Oh, no. Not Holt.

180
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,927
- Don't worry.
I've got this.

181
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,366
- Bonjour, Captain.
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

182
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:57,101
- No, I don't
want to sleep with you.

183
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,435
- Is that what that means?

184
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:01,072
Oh, man, I had a really gross
tennis instructor.

185
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:03,240
- I'm calling to check in
before I get on the flight.

186
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,276
Everything okay?
- [scoffs] Okay?

187
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,412
Let's just say if the house
could talk, she would say,

188
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:11,115
"I've never been happier;
I love Jake."

189
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,616
- Oh, that's interesting,
because I think

190
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,686
the house might say
"Jake's a liar, and I'm...

191
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:17,254
on fire."

192
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:18,589
- What's that now?

193
00:07:18,622 --> 00:07:19,957
- The security company
called me about the alarm.

194
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,626
- Okay, the house
was never on fire.

195
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,029
Charles was on fire,
and only on his pants,

196
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:26,230
and we put it out.

197
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,431
- I'm coming home right now.

198
00:07:27,464 --> 00:07:28,900
- Wait, no.
Sir, please don't do that.

199
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:30,801
You have to go see Kevin.
Everything's fine.

200
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:33,304
- No, my decision is final.
I'm postponing my flight.

201
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,305
Good-bye, Jacob.

202
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,973
- No, sir!
Please, pleaseâ€”ahh!

203
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,541
He said "Jacob."

204
00:07:37,574 --> 00:07:38,943
It's biblical.

205
00:07:38,976 --> 00:07:40,144
Guys, guys!

206
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,445
Holt is headed home
right now.

207
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:43,080
- No!
He can't come home.

208
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,815
We left the door open,
and the dog ran out.

209
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,950
- What? We lost Cheddar?

210
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,121
- These silences
are very hard for me to read.

211
00:07:50,154 --> 00:07:52,289
What's the vibe in here?
- We're freaking out, Charles!

212
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,831
What we have here
is a fugitive situation.

213
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:02,533
Our man has been on the run
for 30 minutes.

214
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,502
Also,
our man is a dog.

215
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:07,238
Now, I know what
some of you are thinking:

216
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,340
"Who cares?
It's just a pet."

217
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,008
- No one was thinking that,
you monster.

218
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,344
- Good.
That was a test.

219
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,846
Now, the average foot speed
of a corgi

220
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,081
is ten miles per hour,

221
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,050
which means
with every passing second,

222
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,019
that slippery bastard
gets farther away.

223
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:25,356
[mellow music]

224
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,692
- Captain Holt does not know
Cheddar is missing...

225
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,094
but he's gonna find out.

226
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,396
Oh, God, I feel like the devil
is dancing on my chest.

227
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,431
- It's all right, Amy.
We have time.

228
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:36,033
Gina's picking Holt up
at the airport,

229
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,335
and she told me she can stall
him for at least two hours.

230
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:42,006
- I'll do it, but I'm gonna
have to total your car.

231
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,741
- Or you could just
drive slowly.

232
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,610
- Ha-ha, she's gonna
wreck your car.

233
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:47,678
- Here's where we're at.

234
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:49,113
Amy and I will take
Blind Charles

235
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,181
and search the neighborhood.

236
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:51,348
Diaz, Pimentoâ€”

237
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:52,716
- Bring the dog back,

238
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,051
dead or alive.

239
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:55,987
- What? No.
I was gonna say hang posters.

240
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,289
Terry, maybe go with them,
make sure nobody gets killed.

241
00:08:58,355 --> 00:08:59,756
- Or maybe I could
join another group

242
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,125
with a different kind of energy?

243
00:09:01,158 --> 00:09:02,526
- Jake, what about
me and Hitchcock?

244
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:03,995
- You two grab Cheddar's treats

245
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:05,529
and put 'em in a bowl outside.

246
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:07,764
- You mean the little sausage
ones that need way more salt?

247
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,001
- On second thought, maybe just
sit exactly where you are

248
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:11,002
and don't touch anything.

249
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:12,203
- Sweet.

250
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,705
- All right, everyone,
it's time to do this.

251
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:18,142
For Captain Holt,
for Kevin, for America!

252
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:20,011
- Let's go, Nine-Nine!

253
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:21,012
[groans]

254
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:23,147
- This line is interminable.

255
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,316
At this rate,
we'll be home in 54 minutes

256
00:09:25,349 --> 00:09:27,384
instead of the usual 46.

257
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:29,886
- Not if I have
anything to do with it.

258
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:31,122
Watch me now!

259
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:32,289
[tires squealing]

260
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:33,724
- No, Gina, the wrong way.

261
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,459
No, Gina, the spikes!

262
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:38,495
- Uh-oh.

263
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:39,530
Well, not a problem.

264
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:41,232
I can get you home
on two wheels.

265
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,467
[tires pop]

266
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,403
And that was
the second pair of tires.

267
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:54,045
- Mm.

268
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,146
- I could've done that.

269
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,847
- Yeah, I know you could've.

270
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,183
But you didn't.
I did.

271
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,190
- I mean, there are lots
of other poles, guys.

272
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:07,858
A whole street
full of 'em.

273
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,260
- So, Adrian,

274
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:10,727
when are we gonna
stop messing around

275
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,096
and do this thing?

276
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:15,099
- Um...

277
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,335
N-never.
- What?

278
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,171
- You know what?
I just realized.

279
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:23,274
I forgot something at home.
I'm just gonnaâ€”

280
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,713
- That was weird.
You okay?

281
00:10:29,746 --> 00:10:32,383
- Yes.

282
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,419
[grunting]

283
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,024
- All right,
according to the call

284
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,359
we just got on the tip line,

285
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,027
someone said they saw
Cheddar on this block.

286
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,429
- I'll head north.
Jake, you head west.

287
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,797
We'll meet back
in a half hour.

288
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:48,399
- Great, which direction
should I go?

289
00:10:48,432 --> 00:10:51,468
[both mouthing words]

290
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,737
What's going on?
I can hear your lips moving.

291
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,206
Ah!
Are you guys kissing?

292
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,207
- What? No.

293
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,041
Charles, stop always
asking that.

294
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,477
Look, I'm sorry,
but you have to stay in the car.

295
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:01,945
- That's a mistake!

296
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,348
My super senses are a tool
you can't afford to leave

297
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:05,849
in the tool chest.

298
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,552
Take me out of the box
and put me on your belt.

299
00:11:08,619 --> 00:11:10,987
- I'm sorry, but you'd
only slow us down.

300
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,823
And that's exactly
what Cheddar wants.

301
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:14,158
That's right.

302
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:17,161
I'm onto you,
you slippery little bastard.

303
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:19,630
[mellow music]

304
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,032
- Gina, come on.

305
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,467
You can do your Internet
socializing in the truck.

306
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,137
- Okay, cool, I just have
to tie my shoe real quick.

307
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,804
Tying it.

308
00:11:27,838 --> 00:11:29,473
Call Jake Peralta.

309
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,642
- Gina, hey,
how's the stalling?

310
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:32,976
- Great; the tow truck
just got here,

311
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,478
so that'll buy us
at least an hour.

312
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,313
- Tow truck? What the hell
did you do to my car?

313
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,315
- Bitch, I told you
I was gonna wreck it.

314
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,416
- You did.
You did.

315
00:11:39,483 --> 00:11:40,917
All right, well,
we're about to go

316
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,586
follow up on a lead
right now.

317
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:45,055
- Great; I'm gonna rip a bunch
of wires out of your dashboard.

318
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,158
- What? No, don't!
Ginaâ€”

319
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,159
Gah!

320
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,228
- I got nothing.
Did you find Cheddar?

321
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:54,531
- Close.
I found Shredder.

322
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,833
- Shredder, no!
No, Shredder!

323
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,502
- You're not Cheddar!

324
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:01,738
I know it looks bad,
but we're gonna find him.

325
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,607
Right after we find Charles.

326
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,276
Charles is gone.
We lost Charles.

327
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,444
- What?
- Charles? Charles!

328
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:08,745
[toy squeaks]
Here, boy!

329
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:09,780
[toy squeaks]
Here, boy!

330
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:16,287
He's so pocket-sized.
He could be hidden anywhere!

331
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,189
- Jake, we need
to focus on Cheddar.

332
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,191
Charles is a grown man.
He can take care of himself.

333
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:21,992
- No, he's not.
He's a Charles, all right?

334
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:22,993
And he's blind!

335
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:24,695
Oh, God,
he's probably already dead.

336
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,763
- Right? So let's not waste
any resources on him.

337
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:28,265
[cell phone rings]
- Wait, it's Charles.

338
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,367
Charles?
- Jake? Is that you?

339
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,502
I can't see my phone.

340
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,304
I've dialed
over 40 wrong numbers.

341
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,805
- It's me.
- I found Cheddar.

342
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,207
- He found Cheddar!

343
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,374
- Which is why I was like,
"We need to go to him."

344
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:38,475
- Charles, where are you?

345
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,010
- I've got him cornered
in some bushes,

346
00:12:40,043 --> 00:12:41,312
but I don't know
where I am, and myâ€”

347
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,613
[train horn blows]
- Wait, stop talking.

348
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,047
I'm hearing something
in the background.

349
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:46,283
What is that, a train
and a girl whimpering?

350
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,118
- That's me; I'm so scared
you're not gonna find me.

351
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,521
- Charles, don't move.
I know exactly where you are.

352
00:12:50,554 --> 00:12:52,223
He's at the entrance
by 7th Street.

353
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:53,390
I used to hang out there
all the time.

354
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:54,458
- Doing what?

355
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,994
- Aw!
I boofed it.

356
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,063
Nothing. Cool stuff.
Having sex.

357
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:01,598
Anyways, it doesn't matter.
Let's go.

358
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:07,037
- Aah!
- Hey, Sarge.

359
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,605
I've been waiting for you.
- In here?

360
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,607
- Yeah, I wanted to have
a private conversation.

361
00:13:10,641 --> 00:13:11,908
Do you think Diaz noticed

362
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,777
that I freaked out a little
when she asked me out?

363
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,446
- You mean the way your eyes
popped out of your head

364
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,113
and you sprinted away
at full speed?

365
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:19,616
Yeah, I think she noticed.
- Damn it.

366
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,318
I'm in kind of a weird
head space right now.

367
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,887
I've got a lot on my plate,
emotionally speaking.

368
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,557
And flirting's one thing,
but a relationship?

369
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,958
- Well...

370
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:30,761
- The last time I let myself
fall for someone was Katya.

371
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:32,496
She was a bartender
at the Garbage Box,

372
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,499
second-rate strip club my mob
buddies and I used to go to.

373
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,068
She was a sweet girl, but I
couldn't save her from the pole.

374
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:40,804
- Oh, she started stripping?
- Nope.

375
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,307
Boss impaled her on a pole when
he caught her skimming tips.

376
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,276
- Ooh! Damn, dude.

377
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,778
Look, coming back
from 12 years undercover

378
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:49,746
is not easy for anyone.

379
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,147
I'm sure Diaz gets it.

380
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,984
- She's so in touch
with her feelings.

381
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,952
And me, hmm.

382
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:59,022
After what I've seen,
after what I've done,

383
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:00,824
I don't know that
I deserve to be happy.

384
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:03,026
- Of course you do.

385
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,861
- Huh.

386
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:07,063
I never looked at it
that way.

387
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:10,767
Wow.
That changes everything.

388
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:13,203
[chuckles]

389
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:14,204
Ha!

390
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:15,205
- I never even
finished my point.

391
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:18,174
- No, Sarge,
you said it all.

392
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,210
You just changed my life.

393
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:24,047
- He's got to be here somewhere.

394
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,215
- What's up, Peralta?

395
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:26,683
Want to jump in
on this tasty sesh?

396
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:28,685
- Uh, you got the wrong guy.
I've never seen you before.

397
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,086
Heh, dumb stoner.

398
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,389
- He referred to you by name.
- Hey, there's Charles.

399
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,758
- Jake? Jake?
- Charles, we're behind you.

400
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,193
- Look!
I found Cheddar.

401
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:38,895
I found him.
- Oh, God.

402
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,332
- I know.
Pretty impressive, right?

403
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:44,335
It's a proud day
for blind people everywhere.

404
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,603
- Charlesâ€”
- It wasn't easy, though.

405
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,739
This guy put up quite a fight.

406
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:51,074
But we're
good friends now, right?

407
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,109
Right?
You gave me a bunch of kisses.

408
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,145
You gave me
a bunch of kisses.

409
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,880
- Damn it, Charles,
it's a possum.

410
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,487
- Oh, no.

411
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,457
- Mercifully, the tires
have been replaced,

412
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,891
so may I please
have the keys?

413
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,826
- Okay, but before we go,

414
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,895
can we just choose
a nice air freshener

415
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:13,364
from the gift shop?

416
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:15,666
You never know when you're gonna
find your signature scent.

417
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,368
- I'm not an idiot, Gina;
I know for a fact

418
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:19,536
you've already found
your signature scent.

419
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,006
- Ugh! I have got to stop
living my life out loud.

420
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,241
- I've had a hell of a day.

421
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,378
I've got a lot
going on in my life,

422
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:29,913
more than Peralta
ruining my house,

423
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,148
so can we please
drop the charade

424
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,385
so I can get home already?

425
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:36,152
- Absolutely, sir.

426
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,224
Wait, I should tell you.

427
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:43,527
Before you got real with me...

428
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,763
I did rip out
all these wires.

429
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:50,701
- All right, everyone,
listen up.

430
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:51,768
Here's where we're at.

431
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,705
Bad news:
Cheddar is still at large,

432
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,740
and you know
that slippery little bastard

433
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:58,675
is just laughing at us.

434
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,578
[mellow music]

435
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,614
We need a new plan,
and we need it now.

436
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:05,982
- Because the walls are
closing in and I can't breathe.

437
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,283
- Come on, guys,
we're just spitballing.

438
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:08,585
There's no stupid ideas.

439
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:10,153
- What if we walk
around the neighborhood

440
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,622
in Captain Holt's clothes,

441
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,289
wait till Cheddar
picks up the smell?

442
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,658
- No, that's insane,
never gonna happen.

443
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,460
Anyone else?
- You guys go off the grid.

444
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:17,828
- I'm listening. Go on.

445
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:19,596
- I get you guys
Mexican passports.

446
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,964
Totally untraceable.

447
00:16:20,997 --> 00:16:22,699
We fake your death
in an apartment fire.

448
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:24,801
I'll need three teeth
from both of you.

449
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:27,871
Then you guys just disappear.

450
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:29,640
It's easy.
I've done it before.

451
00:16:29,673 --> 00:16:30,941
- Oh, have you?

452
00:16:30,974 --> 00:16:32,342
Because you haven't
mentioned it 500 times.

453
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:34,277
Get a new thing.
- Okay.

454
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,980
Amazingly, wearing Holt's
clothes is our best option.

455
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:41,217
Everyone, prepare
to enter high society.

456
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:44,320
[regal classical music]

457
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:51,662
â™ª

458
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:53,830
Okay, how's everybody feeling?

459
00:16:53,864 --> 00:16:56,533
Anyone else have the weird urge
to lecture themselves?

460
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,536
"Peralta, what are you doing?"

461
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,805
- Peralta, what are you doing?

462
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:03,940
- I conjured him.

463
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:06,376
Captain Holt!
What a pleasant surprise.

464
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:09,079
Gina told me that you were
delayed due to a wire situation.

465
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,615
- Yes, the situation is,
you can rip them all out

466
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:13,717
but the car still works.

467
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,118
- Sorry, boo.

468
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,221
- Wait, why is
the whole squad here?

469
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,290
And why is everyone
wearing my clothes?

470
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:23,259
My God.

471
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,261
You lost Cheddar.

472
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,097
- How did you do that?

473
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,102
but I promise you
we can find Cheddar

474
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,904
and you can still
go to Paris.

475
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:35,171
- I'm not going to Paris.

476
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:36,840
Now, get out of my clothes.

477
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,241
Get into your clothes.

478
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,576
Get out of my house.

479
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,811
Get into your carsâ€”

480
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:42,513
- All right, we can
take it from there.

481
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:45,516
Loud and clear.
Once again, so sorry.

482
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,519
[sighs]

483
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:50,654
- Oh, he's so disappointed.

484
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,523
- Look, I'm sorry that
I got you involved in this.

485
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:53,990
I never should have
volunteered us.

486
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:56,159
- No, Jake.
It's not your fault.

487
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,861
It's Amy's.
- What?

488
00:17:57,928 --> 00:17:59,429
- Well, it's not my fault.

489
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,264
Blind.
- Ugh.

490
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,599
- And Jake's not the one
who let Cheddar

491
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,067
go to town
on Kevin's sweaters.

492
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,269
- Please, it's not like
I fed him Kevin's sweaters.

493
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,939
- Wait a minute, guys.
I think this is Kevin's fault.

494
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,406
- No, Jake, it's Amy's.

495
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,175
I know you're trying
to be a cool boyfriendâ€”

496
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,244
yet another reason
why it's not your faultâ€”

497
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:15,912
but Kevin's in Paris.

498
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,381
- Exactly, and that's why
I think it's Kevin's fault.

499
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:19,850
I have an idea
of how to find Cheddar.

500
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:22,686
Amy, don't act weird
when I say this,

501
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:25,121
but we're gonna need
to use the binder.

502
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,257
- Oh, Mama.

503
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,025
- Diaz!

504
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,564
Could we talk?
- What do you want, Pimento?

505
00:18:33,597 --> 00:18:36,399
- Listen, Sarge gave me
some really great advice.

506
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:39,903
So, Rosa Diaz,

507
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:41,071
will you marry me?

508
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:42,072
both: What?

509
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:43,306
- This is what
you told me to do!

510
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,608
- I barely said anything!

511
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:46,109
You cut me off
way too early.

512
00:18:46,142 --> 00:18:47,778
- Sarge, stay out of this.

513
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:49,412
- Gladly.

514
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:51,615
- No, I will not
marry you.

515
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:54,117
How about we just
get a drink first?

516
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,753
- Yeah.
Yeah, that sounds nice.

517
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,790
- Oh, that's
actually sweet.

518
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:01,024
Nope.

519
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,627
- Oh, there he is.

520
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,697
Captain Holt!
Oh, he can't hear me.

521
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,165
[car alarm blaring]

522
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,667
Eh...
[car alarm blares]

523
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:13,670
Okay, well, I guess we know
what those wires did.

524
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:16,039
- I'm not in the mood
for your antics, Peralta.

525
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,207
- Sir, sir!

526
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,975
I think we know
where Cheddar is.

527
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,011
Will you please
just get in the car?

528
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:22,512
- [sighs]

529
00:19:25,616 --> 00:19:27,217
- Oh, let me get that.

530
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,752
Try now.

531
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,353
Oh, I can't control
the locks.

532
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,856
Hang on. Try now.
One, two, three.

533
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,891
Try now. Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

534
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,627
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

535
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,994
Try now.
Try now.

536
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:39,429
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!

537
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:40,831
Try now.

538
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,498
- Cheddar!

539
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:43,667
Come here, baby.

540
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,502
Yeah, yeah.

541
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:48,939
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

542
00:19:49,005 --> 00:19:50,273
How did you know
he was here?

543
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,209
- Well, Cheddar was only
chewing up Kevin's stuff.

544
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:54,711
I figured maybe
he was acting out

545
00:19:54,745 --> 00:19:56,680
because he missed Kevin.

546
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:59,115
- But the real hero here
is the binder.

547
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:00,851
Under "Cheddar,"
subsection "Walk,"

548
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,585
subsection "Walks with Kevin,"

549
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,454
we found this special spot.

550
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,189
- So you're missing Kevin, huh?

551
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:07,357
You're not the only one.

552
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,192
[sighs]

553
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,594
I didn't cancel my trip
because I was worried

554
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,563
you would burn my house down.

555
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:16,867
Kevin and I are having
a hard time right now.

556
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,535
Whenever we talk,
we fight.

557
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,938
And I'm just afraid
and justâ€”

558
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:26,142
just afraid that if I go
to Paris and we fight, then...

559
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:29,279
- Sir, with all due respect,
that's crazy.

560
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:32,248
I mean, you and Kevin
are the best couple I know.

561
00:20:32,282 --> 00:20:36,820
And I'm sure whatever this is,
you can get through it,

562
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,455
because you are
the strongest person I know.

563
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,825
Wow, that was weird;
I said, like, multiple

564
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:44,661
real things
consecutively, yeah.

565
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:46,496
Felt weird but good.
Are you proud of me?

566
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:47,563
- You're ruining it.
- Yup.

567
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:48,832
I'm just gonna
stop talking now.

568
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:50,166
- Well, I suppose
I'm not gonna solve anything

569
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,802
by running away from it.

570
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,737
Perhaps I should go
to Paris.

571
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,673
What do you think, Cheddar?
Huh?

572
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,175
Oh, my, oh!
You really are acting out!

573
00:20:59,242 --> 00:21:02,713
Whew!
I'm sorry you had to see that.

574
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,080
- Oh.

575
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:07,918
- You know,
it's moments like these

576
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,252
that I'm grateful for yourâ€”

577
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,887
[car alarm blaring]

578
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:14,424
- Guys, it's a miracle!
I can see!

579
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,726
- Not now, Charles!
- Shut up!

580
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:16,927
- Right, sorry!

581
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:19,896
[car alarm blaring]
Sorry.

582
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,266
- Fremulon.

583
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,901
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
