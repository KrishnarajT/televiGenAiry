what it does to our bodies.

realized that cruises

a royale level suite.

176
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,741
I never thought
we'd see one in person.

177
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,075
- Little perk of being

178
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:19,911
Carousel Cruises'
entertainer of the year.

179
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:23,247
♪ Which I am, girrr-rl ♪

180
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,616
- A little pitch-y.

181
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,117
- You're welcome
to chill here.

182
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,652
It's the least I can do
to thank you for protecting me.

183
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:30,087
- Never.
This protection scam is a scam.

184
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:31,689
Do you honestly think
you can fool me again

185
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:34,358
just because you've successfully
done it numerous times before?

186
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:36,528
- Look, my old boss
wants me dead.

187
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:38,195
I've been laying low
on this ship,

188
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:39,531
and I got word from
a friend on the inside

189
00:06:39,597 --> 00:06:40,865
that they found me,
and there's a hitman

190
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,967
coming to end
my beautiful life.

191
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,202
That's why I sent you
the free tickets.

192
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,005
- No! No, no way.
I'm not buying it.

193
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:49,541
You can't get away
from me again.

194
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,976
Amy and I are gonna spend every
second of our romantic cruise

195
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,612
watching you,
assuming that's okay?

196
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:56,313
- Yep. That's what
we're gonna do.

197
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:57,549
- Yeah.

198
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:59,116
- I'll just get rid
of this itinerary.

199
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,952
- No, no, no, no, Ames,
don't put that down.

200
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:03,688
We have to find the hitman
before he finds me.

201
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:05,623
I'm guessing this'll take us
all over the boat.

202
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,125
- Oh, yeah, that's
an ENAC sitch right there.

203
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:09,594
"Every Nook And Cranny."

204
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:13,197
- Perfect. We'll just ENAC
sitch, uh, of this bitch.

205
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,199
- How's it going
with your sister, sir?

206
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:16,768
- Well, last night,
she told me in a great detail

207
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:18,469
about a fight she got into
with her trainer,

208
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,938
whom she accused
of stealing a hairbrush.

209
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:23,975
Now she's on the phone,
screaming at our mother.

210
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,276
- We'll keep her
out of your hair.

211
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:26,878
I'm good
at distracting people.

212
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,580
It's what I do with
my toddlers all day long.

213
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,883
How does she feel
about balloon animals?

214
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,985
- I'm sure she has a complicated
relationship with them.

215
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,820
- Ray!
- Here she comes.

216
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,589
No balloon animals.

217
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,290
- You ain't gonna believe
Mom's take on this.

218
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:41,659
She thinks I'm the one
who should apologize

219
00:07:41,726 --> 00:07:43,260
just 'cause it turns out
the hairbrush

220
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:44,896
ended up being in my car.

221
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:47,264
- Yes, I'd love to discuss your
hairbrush for even more time,

222
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:49,634
but I have some pressing
police matters to attend to.

223
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:52,436
- Look at you.
Always working.

224
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:54,606
What happened
to my fun big brother?

225
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,941
- Fun? I was never fun.
You take that back.

226
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:59,076
- I'm sure she didn't mean
anything by it, sir.

227
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,478
- When we were little, we would
go down in the basement,

228
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:03,014
and he would build us
a fort.

229
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:04,816
We would stay down there
all day.

230
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,352
And Ray would sing these silly
little made-up songs.

231
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,387
- George and Ira Gershwin
did not compose

232
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:11,856
silly, made-up songs.

233
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:15,359
- Uh, Debbie, let me
show you New York, okay?

234
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:17,829
The buildings,
the subway, the bank,

235
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:19,897
the dry cleaner—
I got to run some errands.

236
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:21,532
- Oh, that's
a great idea, Gina.

237
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:23,735
Debbie, I'm so sorry
I won't get a chance

238
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:25,336
to see you much on your visit.

239
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,704
- Uh, no thing
but a chicken wing,

240
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:28,773
'cause I'm gonna be here
for six weeks.

241
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,542
I'ma be all up
in your life, okay?

242
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,046
- [gasps] I got five down.

243
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:37,214
I figured out the theme.
It's boats.

244
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:39,016
- Okay, I get it.

245
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,186
She's smart and lovable;
you're scrappy and lovable;

246
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,455
together you're just
lovable and lovable.

247
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,457
- Okay, so where's
this hitman, Judy?

248
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:48,793
- Look, I don't know
who they sent,

249
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,927
but he's on the boat.

250
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,262
Check out this manifest.

251
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:54,365
Somebody boarded in San Juan
named Henry Coles.

252
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:56,400
- Henry Street
and Coles Street,

253
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,736
that's the corner of your old
chop shop in Brooklyn.

254
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,337
This is an alias.
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:02,373
And my porter buddy checked out
Henry Coles' cabin,

256
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,440
He hasn't been in it yet.

257
00:09:03,474 --> 00:09:04,942
He's hiding somewhere
on this boat

258
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,111
ready to jump out and kill me
at any moment.

259
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:08,680
Probably creepin' around
in my closet.

260
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,715
- Or stowed away in a lifeboat.
- Or hiding in a wall.

261
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:11,949
- Or holed up
in the engine room.

262
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:13,384
- Camouflaged
in the shrubbery.

263
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,686
both: Predator style.

264
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:16,688
- [grunts] No.
We are not having fun.

265
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,023
You will not suck me in
with your wily charms.

266
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:23,160
- Señor Gotaro, un café
con leche, sin azúcar.

267
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:24,228
- Gracias.

268
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:27,799
- Hola, Mr. Gotaro.
Good to see you.

269
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:29,901
Can I talk to Rosa
for a quick sec

270
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,236
about some super serious
police work?

271
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:33,705
[whispering] I know what
you're trying to do.

272
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:35,039
You brought him in here
to butter him up.

273
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,374
- Yeah, and I've been
laying it on...

274
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:38,843
real thick.

275
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:39,911
[static crackles]

276
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,478
Mint?

277
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:44,081
- Okay, but you're
making a big mistake.

278
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,850
Nobody sucks up like a Boyle.

279
00:09:45,883 --> 00:09:48,085
Of course, you knew that already
because you're so smart.

280
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:50,487
I just did it to you.

281
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:52,489
- [grunts]
Fine, little man.

282
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,892
Bring it.
- Okay.

283
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:55,927
Looks like you and I

284
00:09:55,993 --> 00:09:58,395
are in a good,
old-fashioned suck-off.

285
00:09:58,429 --> 00:09:59,897
- Don't call it a suck-off.

286
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,699
- Why not?
Why shouldn't—

287
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,834
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

288
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,269
Totally, yep. Mm-hmm.
Right. Smart. Good.

289
00:10:07,038 --> 00:10:08,706
- You brought your own
shuffleboard stick?

290
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,875
- Mm-hmm.
- They're called tangs.

291
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:12,343
You should be glad
she has her own.

292
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:14,211
You don't want her messing
with another man's tang.

293
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:15,913
- There is no way
they're called tangs.

294
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:17,114
- It's true. They are.

295
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,283
And the disks
are called biscuits.

296
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,584
[biscuit scraping]

297
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:22,720
[whispers] Yes.
- Tangs and biscuits?

298
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,021
That is so dumb.

299
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:26,423
I officially love
shuffleboard.

300
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:28,960
Clear a path!
I'm about to whip my biscuit!

301
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:31,062
Yah!

302
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:32,797
- Whoo.

303
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,432
- About time
you smiled, Jake.

304
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,301
You've been a real
tang in the mud.

305
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,070
- All right.
- Hey, little advice.

306
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:40,437
Amy is great.

307
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:41,739
You want to keep her,

308
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,440
be more receptive
to her interests.

309
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,242
- All right, now you're
taking it too far, Judy.

310
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:48,312
I don't need relationship advice
from my criminal archnemesis.

311
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:49,881
- Look, I just want
to see you two happy.

312
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:51,615
- No. This is just
another one of your lies,

313
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:53,084
just like your fake hitman.

314
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:54,418
- There is a hitman
on this boat.

315
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,587
Henry Coles
is coming to kill me.

316
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,589
- Excuse me?

317
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:00,357
- What?
- You said my name.

318
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,658
I'm Henry Coles.

319
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:02,794
- You're Henry Coles?

320
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,461
- According to
my medical alert bracelet.

321
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,997
- Well, this
is interesting.

322
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,165
This is Henry Coles.
Let's just take a look at that.

323
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,235
Oh, it says,
"Doug Judy is a liar."

324
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:14,005
- Actually,
it says I'm a fall risk.

325
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:17,674
- Okay, you're kind of
ruining my burn here, Henry.

326
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:21,078
I knew it. I knew Henry Coles
was a 90-year old man

327
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:22,679
with type 1 diabetes
and emphysema.

328
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:24,148
Obviously, I didn't know
those specifics,

329
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:25,349
but I knew
you were lying.

330
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:26,517
- So Henry Coles
wasn't the guy.

331
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,584
My bad.

332
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:28,820
There's still somebody
on this boat

333
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:29,821
who wants to kill me.

334
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:30,822
- You're trying
to get away,

335
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:32,223
and it's not
gonna happen.

336
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:33,991
We're spending the rest
of this trip in your cabin.

337
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,259
Amy and I will take
sleep shifts

338
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:36,894
to make sure someone's
always watching you.

339
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:40,531
- Thank you. That makes me
feel super safe.

340
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:41,732
[lock beeps]

341
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,334
And if you want to smush,
I have a sleep mask

342
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,003
and noise canceling
headphones.

343
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,839
- Can't we just lock him

into the ocean,
