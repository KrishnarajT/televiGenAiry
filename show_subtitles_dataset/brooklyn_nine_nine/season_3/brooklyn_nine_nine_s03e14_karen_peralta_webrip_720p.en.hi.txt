00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,242
did you have a nose ring
in high school?

180
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,078
- Yes. Until it got infected
and I almost went blind.

181
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:02,113
Don't tell anyone.

182
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:04,816
- Cool. It's our secret.

183
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:07,652
Just gonna check my email
up high.

184
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:09,320
No new messages.

185
00:06:09,353 --> 00:06:11,022
- Amy, can we focus?

186
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:13,424
What is going on here?
Why is my dad dating my mom?

187
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:14,592
What does he want?

188
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,994
Money, but she's a public school
art teacher.

189
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,963
That doesn't make any sense.
[snaps]

190
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:21,165
Maybe that son of a bitch
wants his picture drawn!

191
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:23,200
- Jake, Karen is a grown woman

192
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,169
with a pretty respectable
credit score.

193
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:26,638
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

194
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:27,939
- Amy, I know that you
have a binder,

195
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,106
but you don't know her
like I do.

196
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,975
She's too trusting
for her own good.

197
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,177
She's fallen for more
Nigerian scams than Scully.

198
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,547
- She's fallen
for 20 Nigerian scams?

199
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:36,714
20?

200
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:38,282
That's insane.

201
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,718
No, she's fallen for 2.
Scully's fallen for 20?

202
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:41,719
- [scoffing]
Yeah.

203
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,154
- Look, all right,
you know what?

204
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,556
This is fine.

205
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:46,057
It's just the same
that it's always been.

206
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:47,458
I have to protect her.

207
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,693
I'm gonna go down there,

208
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,662
and I'm going to express
my concerns to her

209
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,697
in a calm,
rational manner.

210
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,465
[yelling]
What are you doing, Mom?

211
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:55,900
He's evil!

212
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,836
- [gravelly voice] I'm glad
we got these sweet cams.

213
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,071
- What is happening
with your voice?

214
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,873
- This is Body Cam Charles.

215
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,407
I got to sound badass

216
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,777
in case anybody watches
the footage, capisce?

217
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,878
[shrilly]
Aah!

218
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:09,246
Oh, I just spilled soup
on the cam!

219
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,048
- Why do you have soup
on a stakeout?

220
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,884
- Oh, no.
Crap!

221
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,385
Oh, it's not turning back on.

222
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:15,653
Do you think Sarge
is gonna be mad

223
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,321
that I spilled "fuh"
on the cam?

224
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:18,656
- He definitely will
if you say pho like that

225
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:19,757
when you tell him.

226
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,925
- I'm not gonna
mispronounce it.

227
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,059
Not while you're rolling.

228
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,260
- Go get yourself cleaned up!

229
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:24,295
- [groans]

230
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,098
- See anything, Sarge?
- Not yet.

231
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:28,600
Don't know why
I didn't go undercover

232
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:30,067
as someone wearing a scarf.

233
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,403
Terry hates windchill.

234
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:34,005
Wait, here's our guy.

235
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,607
- Got him.

236
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:38,610
- Crap!
I think he made me.

237
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:40,244
He's headed toward
the restaurant!

238
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:41,946
You follow.
I'll cover the back alley!

239
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:44,949
[upbeat music]

240
00:07:44,982 --> 00:07:46,684
[tires squeal]
[horn honks]

241
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:50,955
- Someone's in here!

242
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,926
- [grunts]
Uhh!

243
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,260
Ah!

244
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:58,295
- Rosa?
- Charles.

245
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,332
You're completely naked.

246
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:05,202
- You have the right
to remain silent.

247
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,838
You have the right
to an attorney.

248
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:09,440
- [sighs]

249
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,108
- Where is everyone, Gina?

250
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:13,444
- Perhaps that's
tonight's first puzzle.

251
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,279
I forgot to send
the invitations.

252
00:08:15,346 --> 00:08:17,448
But I was able to rally
the best and brightest

253
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,016
of those available.

254
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:21,653
- Oh, dear God.

255
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:22,920
- Sorry we're late.

256
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:24,555
Turns out the front door
was a push, not a pull.

257
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:25,890
- Well, maybe we should
just reschedule.

258
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:26,891
[doors slam]

259
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,693
[alarm sounding]

260
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,128
- You have three hours
to find the four keys

261
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:32,764
that will prevent
the apocalypse

262
00:08:32,797 --> 00:08:34,198
and release you
from this room.

263
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,233
Your time starts now.

264
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,535
- Well, this is
a sobering reality.

265
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:42,774
- Okay,
I got your favorite cake:

266
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,109
blue.
- I'm not hungry.

267
00:08:45,142 --> 00:08:47,745
It's a figure of speech.
Obviously, I'll have some.

268
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,081
- You know,
I don't think our guest Amy

269
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,684
really wants to
talk about this, Jake.

270
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:54,218
Can we just move on?

271
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:55,920
- Yes.
Maybe we could talk about

272
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,123
someone we all admire:
President Jimmy Carter.

273
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,792
When I think of
the great—

274
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:03,160
- So how serious is it, Hmm?

275
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:04,228
Have you guys kissed?

276
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,697
Has he stayed the night?

277
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:07,799
Has he brought you a chocolate
orange from the airport?

278
00:09:07,832 --> 00:09:09,300
'Cause that's his big move.

279
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,002
- Jake, your mother and I
have been seeing each other

280
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,003
for three months.

281
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:13,004
- Oh, you know what?

282
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:14,839
I oughta throw up
in your face.

283
00:09:14,872 --> 00:09:17,374
- I know that you're angry,

284
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:19,376
but when I was here last year,

285
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,146
you really showed me
what a selfish jerk I was.

286
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,016
You're the reason
that all of this is happening.

287
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:26,718
- Yeah, but I didn't want this.

288
00:09:26,718 --> 00:09:28,720
I just wanted you to
text me a dumb dad joke

289
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,054
every six months.

290
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,488
- I can do that.
Just give me your number.

291
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:33,024
- You didn't save my number?

292
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:34,525
- Now, Jake, look.

293
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,761
I know every mistake
your father has made,

294
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:39,530
and he says
they're all in the past.

295
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:41,899
Now just blow out your candles.

296
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,868
- Okay, great.

297
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:44,936
Great idea, Mom.

298
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,839
I'll blow out
my birthday candles.

299
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:50,207
[inhales deeply]

300
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:52,109
[blows]

301
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:55,012
[whispering]
I wished that you would leave.

302
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:56,547
Damn it, I shouldn't have
said it out loud.

303
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,548
Now it won't come true.

304
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,516
- Okay, we have maps,

305
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,886
a pantry, beds, a desk.

306
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,187
Where should we begin?

307
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,756
Do you have any experience
with puzzles?

308
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:05,723
- Yes.

309
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:06,958
I've never solved one.

310
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,293
- This says we have
three questions.

311
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,694
- No.
- Uh-oh.

312
00:10:10,728 --> 00:10:12,263
- How do we get outta here?
- Can't tell you.

313
00:10:12,296 --> 00:10:13,264
- Really?
- Yes.

314
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,399
- That's enough!

315
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:16,700
Sorry about that.

316
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,202
Can we please have
our questions back?

317
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:19,203
- No.

318
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:20,271
And that's three.

319
00:10:20,304 --> 00:10:21,873
You're done.

320
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:24,742
- Oh, Captain,
how could you?

321
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:27,378
- Hey.

322
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:28,946
You didn't come back down.

323
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,215
I had to talk to your parents
for, like, an hour,

324
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:33,050
and I ran out of stuff
from the binder,

325
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:35,386
and then I did something
really weird.

326
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:39,556
♪ The itsy-bitsy spider
went up the water spout ♪

327
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,925
♪ Down came— ♪

328
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,295
So... do you know where
the nearest train station is?

329
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:46,230
- I know it sucks
that I did that,

330
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,799
but think about how I feel.

331
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:50,001
My stupid parents
are borking each other.

332
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,103
And my mom thinks she knows
all the worst things

333
00:10:52,136 --> 00:10:54,005
that my dad did,
but she has no idea.

334
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,773
She doesn't even know
that he cheated on her

335
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:58,009
with her best friend,
Sheila Bodden.

336
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,010
- Oh, my God.

337
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,344
- Yeah, I saw them.

338
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:03,347
They were in our car
in the garage having sex.

339
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,150
It's the whole reason I can't
have sex in cars in garages.

340
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:08,352
- That's a very specific
sexual hang-up.

341
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:10,587
I mean, has it really
held you back?

342
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:13,390
- Well, are we having sex
in car in a garage right now?

343
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,426
No. So, yeah, big time
it's held me back.

344
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:16,828
I never told her about it

345
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:19,563
'cause I didn't want
to crush her heart, but...

346
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,398
now I have to use it.

347
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,835
I'm gonna tell my dad if he
doesn't do the decent thing

348
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:26,237
and leave my mom again...

349
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,605
I'm dropping the Sheila bomb.

350
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:30,574
- Whoa.

351
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,677
I know this is a really
big deal, but I have to ask.

352
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,579
Did you wear this hat
in high school?

353
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,713
- Amy!

354
00:11:41,752 --> 00:11:43,020
You have to tell my mom
that you need to

355
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:44,388
speak with her in private.
- About what?

356
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:45,722
I barely know her.

357
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:47,859
- Tell her you're plugged up
and you need a laxative.

358
00:11:47,859 --> 00:11:48,860
- What? No!

359
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,127
What?
I'm not gonna say that.

360
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,128
- Okay, here's the plan:

361
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:52,964
I drop the bomb
during charades.

362
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,367
I'll just tell him I know
about Sheila... with my body.

363
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,870
- Um...

364
00:11:58,903 --> 00:12:01,272
Fast, uh, fast—
"Fast and Furious"?

365
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,875
"Magic Mike"?

366
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,276
[mutters]
I don't know...

367
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,643
Uh, "Crying Game"?

368
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,179
I don't know.
- Time.

369
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:09,213
- [groans]
Ah!

370
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,117
both: Oh.

371
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,218
- I—I didn't—
- No, no, no.

372
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:15,552
It's fine.
I—it's—I'm—

373
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,321
- Um, right,
why would you be?

374
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,190
- Yeah, it's not like
I'm always, uh—

375
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:20,191
- [strained]
Naked.

376
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:21,725
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

377
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:24,195
Look, man, no one's ever gonna
see that footage.

378
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,629
The case was cut and dry.

379
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,531
It's not like I'm dying
to tell anyone I saw your...

380
00:12:27,564 --> 00:12:28,532
- Bennie and the Jets.

381
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:29,566
- [chuckles]
Sure.

382
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:30,734
Whatever.

383
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,536
- Hey, I've been looking
for you guys.

384
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,238
I just talked
to our perp's attorney.

385
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,573
He's claiming the drugs
you seized in the bathroom

386
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,242
weren't his.
- What?

387
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:40,244
But we saw him throw them
in the garbage.

388
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:41,378
- Yeah.

389
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:43,414
Normally, it'd be your word
against his,

390
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,317
but lucky for us,
you were wearing body cams!

391
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,319
- Yeah, but the thing
about cameras

392
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:51,388
is that they don't really
tell the full objective truth.

393
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:54,225
Images can be distorted.
People often seem naked.

394
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:55,927
- Boyle, what are you
talking about?

395
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:57,728
- Boyle is fully nude
in the footage.

396
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,396
- [yelling]
Why?

397
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:01,832
- The whole thing?

398
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,067
- [clear throat loudly]
- No, no, no.

399
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,068
Not the whole thing.
Okay.

400
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,169
- [panting]

401
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:06,437
- It doesn't matter
how much humping I do.

402
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,738
He's still not getting it.

403
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,240
- [sighs]
Okay.

404
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:10,641
Well...

405
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:12,676
then this is happening.

406
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,780
Hey, Karen, can I talk to you
for a second in private?

407
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,649
I'm a little plugged up.

408
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:21,252
- Oh, well, say no more.

409
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:24,321
I have an entire cabinet
devoted just to that.

410
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:26,323
- Wow.
TMI, you guys.

411
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:27,324
[chuckles]

412
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:29,126
[mouthing]
Thank you.

413
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,628
- Oh, man,
this is so much fun.

414
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:34,631
Thanks for giving me
a second chance, buddy.

415
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,000
- Second chance?

416
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,301
Are you seriously not getting

417
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,136
what I'm charades-ing down
at you?

418
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,837
That was you and Sheila Bodden

419
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:42,639
humping it up
in the back of our car.

420
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:43,640
- What?
I—

421
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:45,109
- Yeah, that's right.
I saw you.

422
00:13:45,142 --> 00:13:46,643
I saw your weird dad butt,

423
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:49,313
and I saw her aquamarine leotard
bunched up around her ankles!

424
00:13:49,346 --> 00:13:50,547
It scarred me for life.

425
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:52,049
- I'm sorry.
I—I didn't know you saw that.

426
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:54,485
- Yeah, well, I did,
and I never told Mom about it,

427
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:57,221
but I swear to you, I will
unless you leave right now.

428
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:59,456
Should be easy for you since
it's your favorite thing to do

429
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,725
aside from humping it up
with ladies.

430
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,861
- You think I'm way more
sexually active than I am.

431
00:14:04,895 --> 00:14:06,263
I mean, I've only
had sex with, like,

432
00:14:06,297 --> 00:14:07,264
400 women.

433
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:08,265
- What?

434
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,433
400?
Oh, my God.

435
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:10,467
- Is that a lot?

436
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:12,203
I mean, all my friends
are pilots.

437
00:14:12,236 --> 00:14:14,071
I'm on the low end of
average.

438
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:15,206
- [sighs]
- Listen.

439
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:17,041
I don't want
to hurt your mother.

440
00:14:17,074 --> 00:14:20,544
Please... don't tell her
about Sheila.

441
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:22,279
- Fine, I won't,

442
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:25,716
provided you leave right now.

443
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:28,885
Your move, white devil.

444
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,157
- So if I'm correct,
this should contain...

445
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:34,558
key number one!

446
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,393
- Yay.
Open the door.

447
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:37,761
- Oh, we need to find
four keys.

448
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,430
And it took half our time
just to find this one

449
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:41,432
because I had to do it
completely alone.

450
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:42,666
You're all useless.

451
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,568

I've been a little busy

"being the worst."

- What?
