00:00:02,387 --> 00:00:03,780
- Jake, hurry up, I'm starving.

- Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:08,611
I just had to grab
my waaaalleeeet...

4
00:00:08,655 --> 00:00:10,004
- Gentlemen.

5
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,542
- Fine, I was trying something,
and it didn't work!

♪

7
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:48,042
- Okay, before we get going,

8
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:51,001
Sgt. Jeffords has suggested
that it would improve morale

9
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:52,525
if we started the meeting

10
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:53,830
with some consensual
non-work jabber.

11
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:55,658
- I just said it might be nice
if you checked in

12
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:57,573
on the squad's personal lives
every now and then.

13
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:58,879
- Exactly, jabber.
Scully, go.

14
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:00,663
- Well, it was just
a regular morning for me.

15
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:03,579
Woke up again
with my dog's butt on my mouth.

16
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:06,016
- This experiment has failed.
Back to work talk.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,583
Peralta, I have a case for you.

18
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:08,845
- Uh, that's a no-can-do, sir.

19
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:10,760
- Oh. Sorry.

20
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,675
I didn't mean to come across
like a rabble rouser.

21
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,024
We're just simply unavail.

22
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,678
We have a meeting
at a new multi-agency,

23
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,027
multi-state task force.

24
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,812
- It's a double multi.
- It's a multi-multi.

25
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:20,291
- You're better at
everything than I am.

26
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:21,728
- Don't say that.
- It is what it is.

27
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:22,990
- They're taking down
a street racing gang

28
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,557
that's been using
souped-up cars

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,036
to transport drugs
across state lines.

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,604
It's a real-life
"Fast and the Furious" movie.

31
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:30,650
- Don't those movies
glorify lawlessness?

32
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:32,303
- No. They glorify
family and loyalty

33
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,044
and big, hard boobs
on both men and women.

34
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:35,742
- And guess who's heading up
the task force?

35
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:36,873
Sgt. Boomer Maxwell!

36
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:38,614
- Oh!
- Damn!

37
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:40,050
What kind of name is that?

38
00:01:40,094 --> 00:01:42,096
Is he a football player
and/or Rugrat?

39
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,054
- Dude, he's an NYPD legend.

40
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:46,666
I heard he took down three
serial killers in one week.

41
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,319
- I heard he defused a bomb
with his teeth

42
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:49,756
because his hands were tied up.

43
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,845
- I heard he bangs constantly.

44
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:53,063
- Hitchcock,
no chime-ins for you.

45
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,848
- Well, good luck.

46
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,719
I know how competitive
these task forces can be.

47
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:58,634
- Especially this one.
Because Boomer's amazing.

48
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:00,723
- In bed.
- Come on, Hitchcock!

- Oh, hey!
What are you doing down here?

51
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:06,990
- Upstairs bathroom's broken.
I think Scully did it.

52
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:08,818
He says he hasn't been in
the women's bathroom,

53
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,906
but who else would leave
a whole

54
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,647
rotisserie chicken in there?

55
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:12,953
- Did you ask Gina
to submit a work order?

56
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:14,650
- Yes,
but she hasn't done it yet.

57
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:16,652
She views doing her job
as quote unquote optional.

58

- Well, I'm glad it's broken,
'cause it's nice to see you.

59

Now, get in that stall
and kill it in there.

60
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,658
- Sorry. I'm a manager now,

61
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:24,138
so I'm trying to be
more motivational.

62
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,140
- Oh! So it's totally cool
for detectives

63
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:27,968
to come down here
and take dumps in our bathroom?

64
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:30,100
- Excuse me, Officer,
you need to check your tone.

65
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:31,754
- Sorry, Sarge,
but we're all sick

66
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:33,408
of detectives
looking down on us.

67
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:35,671
I bet you don't even know
my name, Rosa Diaz.

68
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:36,933
- Okay, look.

69
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:38,674
I get that there's
always been tension

70
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:40,937
between uniformed officers
and detectives,

71
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:42,939
but Rosa is one
of the good guys.

72
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,680
I'm sure she knows your name.

73
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:45,942
- You clearly just texted her
the answer.

74
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:47,727
- No, she didn't.
Della Avocado.

75
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,077
- It's Alvarado.
- Stupid auto-correct.

76
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,382
- I knew you were still
one of them.

77
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:53,907
We all knew.

78
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:54,951
- Great.

79
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:56,387
Now I'm caught in a turf war

80

between my new squad
and my old squad.

81
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,826
- I know this is a big deal
for you as a manager,

82
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:01,392
but I gotta pee real bad.

83
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:03,046
- Right. Right, right, right.
I believe in you.

84
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,395
Teach that toilet a lesson!

85
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,788
- Oh, my God.

86
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:07,137
These guys are
the best of the best.

87
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:10,837
- I mean, I was,
but then I looked

88
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,142
at Boomer's personnel file.

89
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:14,101
We both started
in the same precinct,

90
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:16,190
we both took down drug gangs
our first year as detectives,

91
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,975
and we've both been referred to
as... El Ganador.

92
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,194
- Oh, that's weird.

93
00:03:20,237 --> 00:03:21,891
I've never heard anyone
calling you that.

94
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,197
- Well, they will soon.
The point is,

95
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,807
I'm basically a young
Boomer Maxwell.

96
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,680
Boomer's not running
the special unit anymore.

97
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:28,898
He shattered both his legs

98
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,813
jumping off
the Chrysler Building

99
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:32,162
onto a passing garbage truck
during a chase.

100
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:33,860
- Damn, that is so cool.

101
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:35,035
- They say
he'll never walk again.

102
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:36,819
- Oh.
Well, that's very sad.

103
00:03:36,863 --> 00:03:37,951
But also still cool.
He's gonna be an Ironside!

104
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:38,995
- Wait,
if Boomer's not doing it,

105
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,693
who's running the task force?

106
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:41,781
- Detective Brett Booth
from 6-3.

107
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:43,739
- Oh!
Cool, cool, cool.

108
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:45,001
- Uh-oh. That was your worried
"cool, cool, cool."

109
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:46,176
Who's Brett Booth?

110
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,135
- We were in the academy
together.

111
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:49,832
During a training exercise,
I shot him with a rubber bullet

112
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:50,833
and somehow it got underneath
his goggles

113
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:52,182
and hit him in the eye.

114
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:53,923
It kind of messed up
his depth perception.

115
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,055
- Oh, but that was
a long time ago.

116
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,186
I'm sure he's totally fine now

117
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,187
and he's forgotten
all about it.

118
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,885
- Well, well, well.

119
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,975
If it isn't Jake Peralta,
my old—

120
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,193
Rogers!

121
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:04,847
It happened again!

122
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:06,893
I told you to keep
the walkways clear!

123
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:09,112
You're gonna regret this,
Peralta!

124
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:12,115
Ah!

125
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,900
- Stupid Brett Booth
not letting us

126
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:15,249
on his task force.

127
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:16,946
- Just because you blinded him
in one eye.

128
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,774
His other one works just fine.

129
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,863
- No, I mean, the water cooler
thing was pretty bad.

130
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:22,212
- Yeah, he can't see.
- You know what, screw this.

131
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:23,997
We don't need a task force
to work the case.

132
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,825
All we have to do is solve it
before Booth is done

133
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:27,043
with his interviews
in two days.

134
00:04:27,087 --> 00:04:28,784
- That's impossible!

135
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:29,916
- You know I hate
the word "impossible"

136
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,526
unless it's
immediately followed

137
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:33,006
by the words
"Ghost" and "Protocol."

138
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,485
- Shh.
- Be advised.

139
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:36,487
We have a shooting
or something

140
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:38,794
going on in Brooklyn Heights.

141
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:40,840
- There's an active shooter
in a hotel in Brooklyn Heights.

142
00:04:40,883 --> 00:04:42,189
- Requesting additional units,
squad dispatch.

143
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:43,756
- Multiple casualties.

144
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,061
ESU is en route,
and nearby officers

145
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,193
are responding to the scene
right now.

146
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,803
- We have people running.

147
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,196
Advising
six or seven shots fired.

148
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,806
- Numerous civilians
coming this way.

149
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,068
- Warwick, 9238,
show me going.

150
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:54,070
- 9238, I have you going.

151
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,159
- Hilbert, 9825,
show me going.

152
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:58,074
- 9825, I have you going.

153
00:04:58,118 --> 00:04:59,815
- "Show me going"
and their badge number.

154
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,251
They're telling dispatch
that they're close by

155
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:03,210
and they're responding.

156
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:04,951
- Diaz, 3118, show me going.

157
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:06,822
Rosa Diaz?

158
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,824
- That's her badge number.

159
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:09,999
Rosa's there.

160
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,265
- So there's limited
information about the situation

161
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,745
in Brooklyn Heights,

162
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:18,181
but I did manage to speak
to a captain at the 9-7,

163
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:19,269
who offered an update.

164
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:22,142
- Two, possibly three.

165
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:23,404
Again, the situation's
still developing,

166
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,145
but as of now,
there are three dead

167
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:27,408
and multiple wounded,
all civilians.

168
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:28,539
- So we're going
up there, right?

169
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:29,540
To help Rosa?

170
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:30,933
- ESU is on the scene,

171
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:31,934
and the 9-7 is locking down
the area.

172
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:33,283
It's already a zoo.

173
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:34,502
They wanted us to
remain on alert

174
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:36,156
but not to respond.

175
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,287
- Yeah, but that's
just a suggestion,

176
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:38,636
like how they tell you to drink

177
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,724
eight cups of water
every month.

178
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:42,162
- A day.
- Sarge, come on.

179
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,946
This is not the time for jokes.
- No, it wasn't a suggestion.

180
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,948
We've been ordered to go
about our business as usual.

181
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:47,384
I know you're all concerned
about Rosa,

182
00:05:47,428 --> 00:05:48,733
but she's not going in alone.

183
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:52,346
She's part of a massive
NYPD response.

184
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,262
I mean, she's a badass.

185
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:56,654
She's the toughest
of all of us.

186
00:05:56,698 --> 00:05:58,221
No offense, guys.

187
00:05:58,265 --> 00:05:59,570
- No, that's accurate.
- Very fair.

188
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:01,746
- I could take her.
What? I'm wily.

189
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,313
- I promise you,
I will keep you updated

190
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:04,575
if I learn anything.

191
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,316
In the meantime,
you all have jobs to do.

192
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,362
Dismissed.

193
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:10,581
- Ames.
She's gonna be okay.

194
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,757
- I know.

195
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,758
I love you.

196
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:15,195
- Love you too.

197
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:16,979
♪

198
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:19,329
- Are you done
trying to get into Amy's pants?

199
00:06:19,373 --> 00:06:21,375
- I'm sorry. I'm freaking out.

200
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:22,680
- Look, I'm worried too,

201
00:06:22,724 --> 00:06:24,508
but spiraling isn't
gonna help anything.

202
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,553
We can't go up there,
so the best thing we can do

203
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:26,641
is try not to think about it.

204
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,514
- Well, it's called
compartmentalizing.

205
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,733
Not to brag, but when you come
from a broken home,

206
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:33,343
you get pretty good at it.

207
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:34,518
It's like,
"Hey, whose bra is that

208
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,998
"in the back seat
of my dad's car?

209
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,608
"I'm sure it just blew in there
on accident.

210
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,219
Anyways, off to third grade!"

211
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:40,394
- I can't.
I dwell on everything.

212
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:41,699
I'm a dweller.
I wake up every morning,

213
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:43,484
I'm worrying about
the Zika virus.

214
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,007
Why is nobody talking
about Zika anymore?

215
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:46,791
There's no way it fixed!

216
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:48,663
- Okay, look. We'll just ignore
what's going on together.

217
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:51,492
Okay? Let's focus on the case.

218
00:06:51,535 --> 00:06:53,798
Let's become... street racers.

219
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:55,757
Okay, Charles.

220
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,019
How do I look?

221
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:59,543
- So cool.
How do I look?

222
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,806
- Uh...
you definitely made a choice.

223
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,373
You almost look like—

224
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,462
Right?
This is exactly what he wears!

225
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:07,812
And the best part is...

226
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:10,815
I can use the kerchief
to start the race!

227
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:13,427
- Well, I wanted this op
to feel normal, and... it does.

228
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,255
This is quintessential Charles.

229
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,387
- Okay. Let's go over
the backstories. I can start.

230
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,736
- Actually, it's maybe better
for me to go first

231
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,824
so you can make
some internal edits

232
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,391
before you say yours out loud.

233
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:22,392
- Perfect. After you.
- Great.

234
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:24,307
My name is Axel Richards.

235
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:26,266
I've been driving stolen cars
since I was six years old.

236
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:27,832
- Wow, that's young.
- Oh, yeah.

237
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:29,660
I had to use a Wiffle Ball bat
to just reach the gas pedal,

238
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:30,661
and I never learned
to use the brakes.

239
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:32,533
- That sounds so dangerous.

240
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,274
- Not if you know
what you're doing.

241
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,753
- Great response.
- Thank you.

242
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:37,538
Anyways, things went south
when I got addicted to drugs

243
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,800
after my best friend died in
an active shooter situation.

244
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,410
Oh, I see what I did there.

245
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:42,064
- Hey.
What are you doing in here?

246
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,327
- Holt's scanner
was making me anxious,

247
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:47,287
so I came in here to listen
to some calming music.

248
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,332
It's me singing the song
I wrote.

249
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:51,421
♪ Subway girl

250
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:54,076
♪ Gettin' all the looks

251
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,644
♪ Holdin' onto your

252
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:59,603
♪ Big pile of books, yeah

253
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,519
- Listen. I was thinking,
Rosa seemed pretty annoyed

254
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:03,868
about the broken toilet
up here,

255
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:05,870
and since she's having
a rough day,

256
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,611
I thought it would be nice

257
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,439
if we got it fixed for her
before she got back.

258
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:10,658
- And you came to me
'cause I'm the only one

259
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,747
who ever gets anything done
around here.

260
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,575
- And because you were supposed
to get it fixed last week,

261
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,098
so it's kind of a
second chance for you.

262
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:17,839
- This is a time of crisis,
so we're supposed to be

263
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:19,754
lifting each other up.

264
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:22,452
Why don't you call that plumber
I've been asking you to call

265
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:24,846
for a few hours now?

266
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:26,717
- All units,
hold your positions.

267
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:29,894
- Uh, last I heard,
they've located one shooter,

268
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:31,635
but they can't get to him.

269
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,333
- Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
realize you were on the phone.

270
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:34,856
- Oh, just on hold.
What's up?

271
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,640
- I just wanted to check in
to see if you were all right.

272
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,382
I couldn't help but notice that
you've flattened your mouse.

273
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:41,602
- Sorry.
I get crushy when I'm nervous.

274
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,343
- If there's anything
you want to talk about,

275
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:44,344
my door is always open.

276
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,606
Metaphorically.

277
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,347
In reality,
I often keep my door closed,

278
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,827
for privacy, security,
climate control—

279
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:51,786
you know what, I never even
should've used a metaphor.

280
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:53,353
I'm better than that.

281
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:54,528
If there's anything
you want to talk about,

282
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:56,486
please do so now.

283
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,967
- There is.

284
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,751
I'm so scared for Rosa.

285
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:02,405
And I realized,
I haven't looked at

286
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:04,712
my life insurance policy
since Ava was born.

287
00:09:04,755 --> 00:09:06,496
I'm on hold with them now.

288
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,368
Terry needs a bulkier plan!

289
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:09,499
- Look, I get
that you're worried

290
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:10,935
about your own mortality.

291
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:13,677
Perhaps this fact
will comfort you.

292
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,810
As an NYPD officer,
you're more likely to be

293
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:18,552
crushed by scaffolding
than to die on the job.

294
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:19,814
- Oh, God.

295
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,685
This is a city of scaffolding!

296
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,513
- No, no, Sergeant,
I was only trying to point out

297
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:25,515
that there are millions
of potential ways to die.

298
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,995
Do you know how common
choking is?

299
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:30,390
- Yeah, so this won't be
a problem.

300
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,956
I can pencil you in tomorrow.

301
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,828
- Oh. Uh, we kind of need you
to fix it

302
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,699
before our friend
gets back today.

303
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,874
- I'm sorry,
it's gonna take a while,

304
00:09:36,918 --> 00:09:37,962
and I have other appointments.

305
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,531
I didn't want to do this,
but our friend is a cop,

306
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,011
and she's caught in a Brooklyn
Heights shooting right now.

307
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:44,534
- Oh!

308
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:45,709
So you think
you're the first people

309
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:47,015
that ever needed a toilet fixed

310
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,538
'cause a loved one's life
was in danger.

311
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:53,195
- You're not.
Welcome to New York.

312
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,198
- That's a grim commentary
on the city we live in.

313
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:59,419
- Refresh. No news.
Refresh. No news.

314
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:00,768
Why is there no news?

315
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:02,509
- Charles, come on.
Compartmentalize, remember?

316
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,685
Try and think happy thoughts
like the Shrek musical.

317
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,556
- Come on, Jake,
you know they shut that down.

318
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,558
The health board said there was
too much mud on the stage!

319
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,691
- Yeah, probably for the best.
All right, that didn't work.

320
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,040
How about this?
Let's clean up our desks.

321
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:13,868
Right? That's always good
for a distraction.

322
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:16,871
Oh, no.
Rosa gave me this notepad.

323
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:18,612
I remember I was all,
"Anyone got a notepad?"

324
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:19,917
And she said, "Yep, here."

325
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,006
- Oh, my God, that's so Rosa.
- I know.

326
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,574
- Okay. So, before you can
change a policy,

327
00:10:24,618 --> 00:10:25,749
I'm gonna have to ask you
a few medical questions,

328
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:26,794
check your vitals.

329
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:28,448
- Great. Just do it fast.

330
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:29,797
Terry knows
tomorrow's not promised.

331
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,756
- Okay. Then let's start
with your blood pressure.

332
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,018
- We can skip this part.

333
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,846
I always clock in
at 130 over 80.

334
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,978
Terry's in tiptop.

335
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:38,762
- Shots fired.
Shots fired!

336
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:41,852
- I don't know.
- Oh, man.

337
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:44,812
- And your BP's at 290.
Oh, 350.

338
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:45,813
You broke the machine.

339
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:47,684
- All right, screw this.

340
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,512
There were shots fired.

341
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:50,600
- I just got off the phone.
There are two officers down.

342
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:51,906
Neither one of them is Diaz.

343
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:53,603
- What, are we supposed to
wait until one is?

344

519
00:17:23,602 --> 00:17:25,734
- Definitely.

520
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:30,565
Also, it's fun to watch you
get destroyed by a toilet.

521
00:17:33,612 --> 00:17:35,439
You know what, I'm trying
to keep this line open,

522
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:37,746
so I don't have time
for your bull crap.

523
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,706
Good-bye, Mom.

524
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:42,490
- I'm so sorry,
how's your penis?

525
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:43,839
- Sore.
How's your penis?

526
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:46,625
- Sore.
- I'm proud of us.

527
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,108
- Still too high.

528
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:53,588
Just to let
some of the blood out?

529
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:55,111
- I'm sorry,
but I can't stay here all day.

530
00:17:55,155 --> 00:17:56,591
I have other things to do.

531
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:59,289
- You a traveling nurse, man.
Don't big-time me.

532
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,857
I'm sorry.
Look, it's been a tough day.

533
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:03,772
- Hey, everyone, I got pizza.

534
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,731
Grab a slice.

535
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:07,210
Probably gonna be
a really long night,

536
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,603
and none of you
have eaten anything.

537
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:10,562
- Peralta,
why are you back so soon?

538
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,825
- Because I wanted
to do something.

539
00:18:12,868 --> 00:18:15,305
Hey, guys.
How're you holding up?

540
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:16,698
- I mean, not great, but I know

541
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:18,221
you really don't want
to talk about it.

542
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,615
- No.
We should talk about it.

543
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,617
I'm really scared for Rosa.

544
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:23,879
- Me too.

545
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,620
And it keeps making me
think about my kids.

546
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:26,926
How do I deal with the fact

547
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:28,536
that every day
I leave for work,

548
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,842
I might not come home?

549
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:31,626
- Man, I don't even know,
Terry.

550
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,541
I don't have kids yet,
but I know you love them.

551
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:37,501
And I feel like that's all you
can really do, right?

552
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:39,329
I mean, now that
I'm getting married,

553
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:40,722
I keep thinking if something
happens to me,

554
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,506
it'll actually affect
someone else.

555
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,639
- I'd get over it eventually,
after a lot of therapy.

556
00:18:44,683 --> 00:18:47,816
- I was more talking about Amy,
but yes, you too, Charles.

557
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,821
- Hey, look at that.

558
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,693
130 over 80.

559
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:55,824
Back to normal.

560
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,565
I can get out of your hair now.

561
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:58,827
- Nice.

562
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,655
Told you, Andrew.

563
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:02,222
Terry's in tiptop.

564
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:06,269
Thanks, Jake.

565
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,532
- Captain.
I know you don't eat pizza,

566
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:10,796
but I figured you'd want
to be included.

567
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,928
- Uh, thank you.

568
00:19:12,972 --> 00:19:15,235
You know what would make
a great movie?

569
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:16,802
One where the hero
sits with his friends

570
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:18,368
and they talk
about their emotions.

571
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:19,674
- I know that you're just
being nice right now,

572
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:20,893
but that would be
a terrible movie.

573
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:21,937
I mean,
what would the poster even be?

574
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:23,243
Just a bunch of people's faces?

575
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:24,723
- Guys.
Guys, guys, guys.

576
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,638
They just took both shooters
into custody.

577
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,291
Officers got injured
in the action.

578
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,641
They don't say how many.

579
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:31,730
- Call Diaz.
Get her cell.

580
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,296
- Damn it.

581
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,733
It's still just going
to voice mail.

582
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,565
- Okay. I don't have the names
of the injured officers,

583
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:42,828
but if Diaz is unharmed,

584
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:43,959
she should be
contacting us shortly.

585
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:45,874
Or, if her phone is dead,

586
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,920
perhaps she'll be walking out
the elevator at any moment.

587
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,274
- Come on, Scully!

588
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,710
- You can't be doing stuff
like that, man!

589
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:56,755
- I was just making
a copy downstairs.

590
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,582
- Yeah, well, next time, think.

591
00:19:58,626 --> 00:19:59,975
- I don't know!

592
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,673
- Okay, Jake.
- Come on, man. Go easy on him.

593
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:03,718
- Diaz!
- Rosa!

594
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:04,980
- You're okay!
Where'd you come from?

595
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:06,721
- Felt like walking,
so I took the stairs.

596
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:07,809
Also, I thought it'd be funny
to mess with you guys.

597
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:09,376
- Rosa, you know I hate pranks.

598
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,725
- You love pranks.
- I do. I really do.

599
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,815
You did it so good.

600
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,730
- Were you guys worried
about me or something?

601
00:20:15,774 --> 00:20:17,253
- No.

602
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,602
Did they shoot at you?

603
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:19,647
Were you in the thick of it?

604
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:20,735
- It's been a really tough day.

605
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:21,867
I just want to get a beer.

606
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,346
I don't feel like
getting into it.

607
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,347
Because the journey

608
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,349
I went on today taught me

609
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,742
that sometimes it's best
to talk about things—

610
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:28,874
- Jake.
- Right. It was a stupid idea.

611
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,832
And Holt told me to do it, so.

612
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,268
Let's just go get a drink
and sit in total silence.

613
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:33,792
- Perfect.
First, I gotta go to the can.

614
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:34,880
- Actually,
you might want to check out

615
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:36,751
the ladies' room up here.

616
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:37,752
Hey, Rosa, it's me,
Gina Linetti.

617
00:20:37,796 --> 00:20:39,014
Welcome back.

618
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:40,755
Me and Amy made
a little surprise for you,

619
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,844
and I think you're gonna
like it very, very much.

620
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,933
Come on, girl.

621
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,848
Ta-da!

622
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:48,807
- You made it sound like
you fixed the toilet.

623
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,373
- Yeah, I thought
maybe Amy would've

624
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,766
pulled something together
in the two minutes

625
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,376
I stepped outside.

626
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,944
- Hey, Tina! Look what I stole
from the Barnes and—

627
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,991
Oh, my God, Rosa!
I'm so happy to see you!

628
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:01,080
- Wait, are you covered
in toilet water?

629
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:03,386
- Yes, big-time.
But this is happening.

630
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,388
- Ugh. Fine.

631
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:06,999
- I feel like I'm lurking.

632
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,000
- Gina, get in here.

633
00:21:08,043 --> 00:21:10,089
- Yay!

634
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,093
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
