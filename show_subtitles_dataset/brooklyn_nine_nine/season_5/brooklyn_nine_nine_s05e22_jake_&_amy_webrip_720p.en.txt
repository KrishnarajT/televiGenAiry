1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:03,788
- I can't believe
this is a rec center.

2
00:00:03,831 --> 00:00:05,529
It looks amazing.
- You look amazing.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:06,747
Foxy as hell.
- Simmer down, Boyle.

4
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:07,922
- No, no, I love it.

5
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,054
Amp it up, Boyle.
- Happy to.

6
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:10,403
Jake, your body's kicking

7
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:11,752
and skin is clear
as a summer day.

8
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:13,276
- Ooh!

9
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:15,582
- Jake.
- Ames, you look beautiful.

10
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:16,714
But when are you
getting your makeup put on?

11
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,542
Y'all, she woke up like this.

12
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,934
- Not now, Jake.
We're in crisis mode.

13
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,414
The cake hasn't arrived yet.

14
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,546
Mason woke up
with the chickenpox,

15
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,764
so we don't have a ring bearer.

16
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,418
Plus, look
what I found on my veil.

17
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:26,941
- Ooh.
- I planned everything

18
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,595
so perfectly,
and now it's all falling apart.

19
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:30,075
- No, it isn't.
Take a deep breath.

20
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:31,511
All right, we got this.

21
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,034
Terry, Rosa, will you please

22
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:34,645
take this veil to a dry cleaner.

23
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:36,299
And if they won't do
a rush job, make them.

24
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:37,735
Use force.

25
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:38,866
- I mean, we're not
gonna abuse our power.

26
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,346
- Of course not.
We're good cops.

27
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,782
I was just exaggerating.

28
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,088
Rosa, I was not exaggerating.

29
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,698
- Great.

30
00:00:44,742 --> 00:00:46,831
- Okay, now for
the ring bearer situation.

31
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,485
This actually might be
a blessing in disguise.

32
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:49,834
I know that he's your nephew,

33
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:51,052
but I wasn't
super jazzed about Mason.

34
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:52,619
- Yeah, he should be cuter.

35
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:53,620
- His face is too small
for his head.

36
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:55,056
He's a "Dick Tracy" villain.

37
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,319
But I have an idea
for a new ring bearer

38
00:00:56,362 --> 00:00:57,624
who is very adorable

39
00:00:57,668 --> 00:00:59,844
and very obedient.
- I would be—

40
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,019
- I'm talking about
Cheddar the dog.

41
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,542
- Yep, right.
- Brilliant.

42
00:01:02,586 --> 00:01:03,978
He loves responsibility.
I'll go pick him up.

43
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,719
- I'm gonna go with Holt.

44
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:07,417
Seems like people are
pairing off for adventures

45
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,983
and we have the best rapport.

46
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,463
Are you crazy?

47
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:11,595
What about my—

48
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,639
Got your meds right here.

49
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:14,380
I brought them just in case

50
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,642
Hitchcock decided
to wear his toupee again.

51
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:16,817
It's very clearly
not human hair.

52
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:18,428
- Human hair
is indistinguishable

53
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,646
from badger fur.

54
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,821
- That is absolutely
not the case.

55
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:22,388
But that reminds me,
you two,

56
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,694
our wedding band
cancelled last minute,

57
00:01:23,737 --> 00:01:24,912
and I need you
to find a replacement.

58
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:26,479
- You can count on us.

59
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:28,089
- Flattop and The Freak.
We always deliver.

60
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,091
- Not in any way, shape or form.

61
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:31,745
But it's a very stressful day
and I thought things would

62
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,356
go better without
Hitchcock and Scully here.

63
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:34,835
- Aw, that's so smart.

64
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,837
- Look, babe, we planned
a great wedding.

65
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:38,404
It's gonna be a perfect day.

66
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,493
- Phone call for you sir.
- Ah, thank you.

67
00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:42,539
That would be the cake guy
saying he has arrived.

68
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:43,844
Hello?
Jake Peralta?

69
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,499
- There's a bomb
at your wedding.

70
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:47,848
It's set to explode at 5:30.

71
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:49,676
Everyone inside will die.

72
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:57,031
- So...
that was not the cake guy.

73
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:07,172
♪

74
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,575
Okay, we called the bomb squad

75
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:19,663
and got everyone
out of the building.

76
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,881
- We should leave.

77
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,143
- Who would do
something like this?

78
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:23,971
- Well, I clearly have
an arch-nemesis.

79
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:24,972
Finally.

80
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:25,973
Must be someone I put away

81
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:27,497
who's hell-bent on revenge.

82
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,846
He's probably gonna
make me choose between

83
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,543
saving the city and
saving the woman I love.

84
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,719
Little does he know,
I can save both.

85
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:35,940
Someone is trying to blow us up.

86
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:37,898
- I'm calm because
there's not really a bomb.

87
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,204
I mean, if you're
trying to kill someone,

88
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:40,727
you don't call and
give them a heads-up.

89
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,555
- So they're just
trying to scare us?

90
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,078
- Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
The bomb squad's on their way.

91
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,124
They'll do a quick sweep,
find nothing and split, and

92
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:48,474
this will just become a funny
story we work into our vows.

93
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,911
"Amy, there was a bomb
at this wedding.

94
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:53,914
Ya butt.
Ya butt is da bomb."

95
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:55,525
- Please don't say that
during the ceremony.

96
00:02:55,568 --> 00:02:56,787
- Is it that you don't like
wordplay or you don't

97
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,528
want me to talk about
your butt at all?

98
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:00,138
Because one of those notes
is really gonna pull a thread.

99
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,227
- How did this guy even
find out about the wedding?

100
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,750
The stupid
engagement announcement

101
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:05,099
Charles put in the paper!

102
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,927
It had the time and location
of the ceremony.

103
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,104
- Amy, be very careful about
throwing around accusations

104
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,236
like that, because
if you're trying to say

105
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,107
I somehow ruined Jake's wedding,

106
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,240
then I'm gonna kill myself!

107
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:17,503
So tread lightly.

108
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,983
- Okay!
Just take it easy, Charles.

109
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:20,811
Nothing is ruined.

110
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:22,813
See?
The bomb squad is already here.

111
00:03:22,856 --> 00:03:24,771
And they brought a robot.

112
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:26,077
This is exactly how I imagined

113
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,600
my wedding would be
when I was a kid.

114
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:28,949
- Well, well, well.

115
00:03:28,993 --> 00:03:31,604
Amy Santiago.
- Amy, look.

116
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,606
Your ex-boyfriend is here
on our wedding day.

117
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,129
Why?
- This is my crew.

118
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,131
Yeah, you called me boring,
so I leveled up my cool.

119
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,569
And now I run the bomb squad.
I also started traveling.

120
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,527
I went to Belgium.
They have the best spaghetti.

121
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,137
- Teddy, let's get everything
out on the table here.

122
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,531
Last time we saw you,
you kind of proposed to Amy.

123
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:46,663
So you're not still
in love with her, right?

124
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,186
- No, I definitely am.

125
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,014
My therapist told me
to stop trying to get over it.

126
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:51,624
- Oh, weird that you wouldn't
hide it even for your own pride.

127
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:53,496
- But seriously, don't worry.
I'm a cop.

128
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,932
I have a job to do, and
I'm gonna do it professionally.

129
00:03:54,975 --> 00:03:56,150
- That's great.
I'm happy to hear that.

130
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,717
- Meaning I will be doing

131
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,066
a super thorough sweeping
of the building.

132
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,198
It's gonna take hours,
so you should

133
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,242
probably just cancel
the wedding.

134
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:02,722
Anyway, congrats you two.

135
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:03,897
- Congrats on the bomb squad.

136
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:05,595
- Charles!
- Right.

137
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:07,814
- So are you bringing
someone to the wedding?

138
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:09,555
- No, I'm taking a break
from dating for a while.

139
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,645
- I'm sick of asking people
how many siblings they have.

140
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:14,255
Oh, is it somewhere
between zero and two?

141
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,170
How fascinating.

142
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,868
- But you never know when you're
gonna find your dream person.

143
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:20,610
Anyone on the street could be
they.

144

"how to talk to
your bisexual friends."

146
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,528
- Yeah.
Look, the point is

you can close yourself off
all you want.

148

175
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:26,371
Oh, no, I left it in the car!

176
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:28,982
It's not my fault.
The driver was so hot.

177
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:30,810
Not for me, for Rosa.

178
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:32,725
She was clearly
flirting with her.

179
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,032
Oh, I know, I'll just call the
company and bring her back here.

180
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:36,816
And then who knows
what'll happen?

181
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,122
- Wait a minute,
did you do this intentionally

182
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,210
so I'd have to
see that girl again?

183
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,081
- No!
That's crazy.

184
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,910
This is Jake and Amy's wedding.
I would never do that.

185
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:46,260
But you gotta admit,
it does seem like

186
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,653
the universe is
pushing you two together.

187
00:05:47,697 --> 00:05:49,002
both: Terry!
- Right, right.

188
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,830
Look, we'll go find the veil.

189
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:52,745
- I can't believe
this is happening.

190
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,791
- Don't worry about them.
Let's go check on Teddy.

191
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,357
I'm sure he's
made a ton of progress.

192
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,663
- Nope.
Haven't even gone in yet.

193
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:59,099
Still putting on the bomb suit.

194
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:00,623
Yeah, my job is super dangerous,

195
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,102
but I like
living life on the edge.

196
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:03,887
Just kind of sexy
if you think about it.

197
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,671
There's no bomb.

198
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,107
If they wanted us dead,
they wouldn't have called first.

199
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:09,066
- It's not always
the bomber who calls.

200
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,676
Maybe he had a young daughter,
found a key to his secret room,

201
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,199
came across some blueprints,
felt guilty,

202
00:06:12,243 --> 00:06:13,374
and wanted to save your life.

203
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:15,246
- Seems unlikely.
- Well, Amy,

204
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,030
in this life, it's sometimes
the unlikeliest outcomes that—

205
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,858
- Feels like you're winding up
to propose again here.

206
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:19,903
- I was.
Good catch.

207
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,644
Amy, would you—
- No!

208
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:22,949
- You still did it.
- All right.

209
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:24,081
Well, this is gonna
take a while,

210
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:25,212
so you have time to reconsider.

211
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,171
Off to do my
super dangerous job.

212
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,870
- I can't handle this.
I need a cigarette.

213
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,698
- I knew that you would,
so I came prepared.

214
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:34,134
Nicotine patches.

215
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,919
You just put it
on your shoulder and—

216
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,703
whoa, stuck it right
on your face, huh?

217
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,139
- I want it as close
to my brain as possible.

218
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:40,706
- That's unsettling.
All right, listen up.

219
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,273
I think I know how to fix this.

220
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:43,883
All we have to do is figure out
who my arch-nemesis is,

221
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,929
track him down and
get him to admit to Teddy

222
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,234
that there's no bomb.

223
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:48,714
We have three hours
to save this wedding.

224
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,281
- That's good.
I love you so much.

225
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:51,804
- I love you too.
Wait.

226
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,328
You're talking to the nicotine,
aren't you?

227
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,069
- I can love two things.

228
00:06:58,245 --> 00:06:59,464
- Look, I was told to drop off

229
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:01,901
one Nakatomi Plaza
wedding cake at 2:15.

230
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,511
- Yeah, but they won't
let us inside the venue,

231
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:05,296
so can you please take it away
and bring it back later?

232
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,428
- Sorry, ma'am, I can't.
I have other deliveries.

233
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:09,517
- Man, it's gonna
melt in the sun.

234
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,084
- Don't worry, Amy,
I'm gonna keep it chilled

235
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:12,738
with my cool breath.

236
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,305
- Oh, my God,
the cake looks amazing!

237
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:15,828
Charles, why are
you spitting on it?

238
00:07:15,872 --> 00:07:17,438
- Because I didn't
ruin your wedding.

239
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:18,875
- Kay.

240
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:20,137
- Were you able to
trace the number

241
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,138
that called in the threat?
- Yes.

242
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:22,835
It was a burner, but

243
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,141
they caught it pinging
off a cell tower in Fort Greene

244
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:26,447
one block away from
the last known address

245
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:27,492
of Frank Gillespie.

246
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,190
- I arrested him
for armed robbery in 2008,

247
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:31,365
and he got out of Rikers
a year ago.

248
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,758
He's got be my arch-nemesis.

249
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,107
He's definitely
obsessed with me.

250
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:37,328
- Well, we didn't have
enough evidence against him

251
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,808
at first, so let's just say
I had to get a little creative.

252
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:41,027
No. Ames.

253
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,942
I went undercover and
became best friends with him.

254
00:07:42,986 --> 00:07:44,378
And then he told me
about his lymphoma,

255
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,164
and we ran a 10K together,
and then I arrested him.

256
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:50,123
He felt so betrayed.
The trial was very emotional.

257
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:51,908
- All right,
let's go talk to him.

258
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,474
That must be our guy.
- Hey, great attitude, Ames.

259
00:07:53,518 --> 00:07:54,780
You're handling this
really well.

260
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:56,173
Ah, there they are.

261
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:57,957
- All right, she
should be here any minute.

262
00:07:58,001 --> 00:08:01,352
Her name is Alicia.
Switch with me.

263
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:03,049
That's your good side.

264
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:05,617
- All right, can we just
focus on finding the veil?

265
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,140
- Really, it's not a big deal.

266
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:08,576
I'm sure it's in her car.

267
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,100
Oh, there she is.

268
00:08:10,143 --> 00:08:12,493
Do you mind if I slyly
mention you're single?

269
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:14,495
- Do not do that.
- You won't even notice.

270
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:15,888
- Hey, you needed
to see me again?

271
00:08:15,932 --> 00:08:17,020
- Rosa's single.

272
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,543
- Ignore him.

273
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,284
We left a dry cleaning bag
in your back seat.

274
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:22,895
- Oh, uh, I didn't see anything,
but you can take a look.

275
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,463
- The veil's not here, Rosa.
We're so screwed!

276
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,334
- Hold on.
Don't freak out.

What the hell are you doing?

281
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:40,173
You were the one that said—

282
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:41,522
- That was before
the veil went missing,

283
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,394

Why is this so heavy?

Teddy won't

- Don't know.

294
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:07,374
They only said "Gina" once, and
it was kind of in the beginning.

I simply want
everyone to focus on

302
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,474
the bride and groom,

303
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:24,043
my lifelong dream, which
I spent decades working towards,

00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:25,392

untethered in this world

308
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:35,054
- Okay, Gillespie's apartment's
right over here.

00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,361
- Oh, this is exciting. We're
gonna catch my arch-nemesis.

310
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:38,928
Do you think he has a shrine of
photos of me

311
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:39,929
with the eyes scratched out?

312
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:41,582
- Let's not rule out

313
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:43,062
the very real possibility
that it's entirely sexual.

314
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:44,237

would be super upsetting

315
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,456

323
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:58,251
He died a year ago.

324
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:00,297
What happened?
- Well, his lymphoma came back.

325
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,734
But really, it was
the loneliness that killed him.

326
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:04,257
Somebody hurt him, and he just

327
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,693
couldn't make friends
after that.

328
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:07,521
- So it seems like
he died because of me.

329
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,610
Just gonna lock that up
in a little box in my brain

330
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:11,003

331
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,439

Dario Moretti,

332
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,180

333
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:15,573
He lives right around here too.

334
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,314
- He hated me.

335
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:20,056
What if this is the work of
my arch

336
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,536
- So you're suggesting
I'm not involved in this at all?

337
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,582
I mean,
you hear yourself, right?

338
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,671
That's a bit of a stretch.
- Yeah, Amy.

339
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:29,282
- Are you actually mad
that someone might not hate you?

340
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,718
- Yeah, I am, Amy!

341
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:32,155
Oh, wow, that's
a bad color on me, isn't it?

342
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,504
All right, fine,
we'll check out your guy

343
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,288
and I'll be totally fine
with it if it's him.

344
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:37,595
Oh, man, you got a whole shrine!

345
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,771
Even the eyes
are all scratched out.

346
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,555
- Babe, when we're married,
we're gonna share everything.

347
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,384
Bank accounts, health insurance,
arch-nemeses.

348
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,560
- Aww, that's nice, Ames,
but you don't have to say that.

349
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,127
Charles, will you put this
picture of me up on the wall?

350
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,128
- Copy that.
You want the eyes scratched out?

351
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,303
- Uh, you know I do.

352
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:54,655
- Lieutenant Wells!
Where is Teddy?

353
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:55,787
- Hi, Jakey.
- Aunt Linda.

354
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,267
What are you doing here?

355
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,268
How'd you get past
the police barricade?

356
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:59,834
- Well, I moved them.

357
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:01,836
Now, I know I was
supposed to come here solo,

358
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,664
but I had to
invite my friend Barb.

359
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,362
She was so down in the dumps.

360
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,624
- Yeah, that's all fine.
Don't worry about it.

361
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,321
Actually, you know what?
That's not fine.

362
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:09,801
Barb can't be here. You
can't just add someone day of.

363
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:12,282
- Teddy, meet Dario.

364
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:13,761
He has a wall
full of Amy photos,

365
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,633
and he's the one
that made the bomb threat.

366
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,330
- And I'm Aunt Linda.

367
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:18,636
- Okay, Aunt Linda,
I love you but you gotta go.

368
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,159
Okay? Thank you.
Give us a moment here.

369
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:21,291
All right, Dario,
tell Lieutenant Wells

370
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:22,466
what you told us.

371
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:24,424
- Okay, I've hated
Detective Santiago

372
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:25,773
since she arrested me,
and then I saw

373
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:27,558
that engagement announcement
in the paper.

374
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:28,689
- But you could have figured out
where the wedding was

375
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:29,690
even without that, right?

376
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,257
- No, I was trying.

377
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,476
I had totally given up, really.

378
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,480
- Anyway, I made the threat,
but there's no bomb.

379
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:38,264
- Just like
I've been saying all along.

380
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:40,310
Now, can we please
go back in the venue?

381
00:11:40,353 --> 00:11:41,702
- First of all, there's
nothing inherently creepy

382
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:42,921
about a wall of Amy photos.

383
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,488
- Uh-huh.
- Secondly,

384
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:45,532
I'm not gonna just
take this guy's word

385
00:11:45,576 --> 00:11:46,925
for it that there's no bomb.

386
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:48,709
He's the one who would know.

387
00:11:48,753 --> 00:11:50,494
- So you think a cop should
just stop what they're doing

388
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,322
as soon as a criminal
tells them they didn't do it?

389
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,672
- Oh, my God! That is
actually a really good point.

390
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,195
- So I only had one passenger

391
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,718
after you,
and he got off here.

392
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:58,937
- I don't know.

393
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:00,373
I mean, he was wearing
some dumb hat.

394
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:01,853
I'm sorry,
I know that's not helpful...

395
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,463
both:
All hats are dumb.

396
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:04,725
- Ha!

397
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:06,466
Is that your laugh?

398
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,555
Also, quit vibing,
and help me solve this.

399
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:10,601
- Sorry, man.
It's what the universe wants.

400
00:12:10,644 --> 00:12:12,690
- Screw the universe.
The universe is a dick.

401
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,387
- Maybe it fell out
when he got out of the car.

402
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:15,693
- Wow, you are so smart.

403
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,174
- Oh, oh, yep, yep, yep.
Here it is.

404
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:20,654
Uh-oh.
It's kind of dirty looking.

405
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,787
But, you know, that's why they
put it in a dry cleaning bag.

406
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,615
I'm sure everything inside
is totally—

407
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,356
Nope.
Soaked in urine.

408
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,227
Damn it, New York.

409
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:33,363
- Kay, you've been staring
at your phone for 45 minutes.

410
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:35,452
Just read the email.

411
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:36,714
- Sir, do you know
how many times

412
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,194
I've not gotten
something that I wanted?

413
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,325
- Zero.

414
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,674
Because I have a trick.

415
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,285
Whatever that email says,

416
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,461
you just act like that's
what you wanted all along.

417
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:45,940
- Well, I can't fake it.
I want this job.

418
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:47,681
For years,
I've worked nights and weekends.

419
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,248
I've sacrificed friendships.

420
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:52,338
I've jeopardized
my relationship with Kevin.

421
00:12:52,382 --> 00:12:54,645
And now...

422
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,734
to find out
if it was all in vain.

423
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,996
- Yeah, let's not check it.

424
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,693
It feels like
there's a lot on the line.

425
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,694
- Agreed.

426
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,695
Let's just grab Cheddar

427
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,696
and go to the wedding.

428
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,742
Where is he?
Cheddar?

429
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,918
Cheddar!

430
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:09,660
Cheddar the dog!

431
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:10,922
Oh, he ate the cake.

432
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:14,404
- Oh, Cheddar,
you furry little pig.

433
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:15,927
- Okay, Amy.

434
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,755
I got through every room
and I cleared them very fast,

435
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,496
because I love you
and I want you to be happy,

436
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:20,714
even if it's with somebody else.

437
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,933
Did that new tactic work?
- No.

438
00:13:21,976 --> 00:13:23,456
- You just called it a tactic.

439
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,805
- Can we get in
the venue or not?

440
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:26,546
- Not quite yet.
There's one more vent

441
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,505
we can't get into,
and our snake cam broke.

442
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:30,811
We got another one on the way.
It'll be here in about 6 hours.

443
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:32,422
No.
We need it now.

444
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:33,814
People are already here.
- I'm sorry.

445
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:34,946
The vent is very tight,
and no one

446
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:35,990
on my team can get into it.

447
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:37,296
I've been doing a lot of Pilates

448
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,602
so I'm pretty huge
at this point.

449
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,473
- I'm going in.

450
00:13:40,517 --> 00:13:41,996
Look, this is all my fault.

451
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,607
I put the announcement
in the paper

452
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,956
and ruined this day.

453
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,349
And now I'm gonna be
the one to fix it.

454
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,611
Get ready, you two.

455
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:48,873
I'm about to save this...

456
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,397
Bomb!
There's a bomb!

457
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:53,356
- Damn it, Dario.
Why'd you say there was no bomb?

458
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,748
- Because I wanted to kill Amy.

459
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,315
- Then why did you
call in the threat?

460
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,664
- I didn't.
My daughter found my hidden room

461
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,013
and discovered some blueprints.

462
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:01,451
Yes, fine, Teddy.
You were right.

463
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:02,800
Now can you please
get the bomb out of the vent

464
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:03,888
and dispose of it somewhere?

465
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:05,281
- Honestly, I wish we could.

466
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:06,412
But it's too dangerous to move.

467
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:07,761
We have to diffuse it on site.

468
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,806
I have to evacuate
this entire block.

469
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:09,807
It's gonna take all night.

470
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,808
- Wait, so you're saying—

471
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:11,809
- Wedding's off.

472
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,464
For real, it's over.

473
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:17,554
- Jakey, what's this that
I hear that there's no rabbi?

474
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:18,685
- Not now, Aunt Linda!

475
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,560
- Okay, so we just finished
processing Moretti.

476
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:24,909
Did you talk to our parents?
- Yeah.

477
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:26,040
They ended up
having dinner together.

478
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,564
It sounded like they had fun.

479
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:28,782
Our dads only got in
one arm-wrestling match.

480
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,088
- Neither.

481
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,089
They both threw out
their shoulders.

482
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,873
What a disaster.

483
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,875
- Yeah.
But, look, I know

484
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,791
it seems like
everything sucks, but

485
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,576
why don't we just
get married tomorrow?

486
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:41,186
You know, we won't have
a venue or a band

487
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,928
or any of our guests,
but we could go to city hall.

488
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,582
- Jake, do you really
want to get married

489
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,627
in the same place people go
to get restraining orders?

490
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:50,413
- Amy Santiago, I would
marry you any time, any place.

491
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,936
I would marry you
in the steaming filth

492
00:14:51,979 --> 00:14:53,067
of the Gowanus Canal.

493
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,852
- Sweet.
But also, gross.

494
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,419
- I would marry you on
the G Train in the summertime

495
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,681
when the air conditioning
is broken.

496
00:14:58,812 --> 00:14:59,813
- I would marry you on top of

497
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,032
the Empire State Building.

498
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:02,033
- Well, that sounds
kind of nice.

499
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:03,077
- During a King Kong attack.

500
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:04,601
- Oh, yeah, that's not good.

501
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,606
Okay.
City hall it is.

502
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,869
- No!
I was eavesdropping.

503
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,653
I'm always eavesdropping.
- I don't like it.

504
00:15:13,697 --> 00:15:15,046
- Look, I didn't spend
the last seven years

505
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:16,613
watching your love ripen,
only to have it

506
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:18,528
sullied by a city hall wedding.

507
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:20,486
You're getting married
right here, right now.

508
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,792
- Come on.

509
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:23,228
Boyle, I don't
even have a dress.

510
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:24,882
- You can wear Gina's.
I'm sure it's white.

511
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:25,970
- There's no way
Gina was gonna wear

512
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,058
a white dress to my wedding.

513
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:28,494
- No, I definitely was.

514
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:29,974
What?
