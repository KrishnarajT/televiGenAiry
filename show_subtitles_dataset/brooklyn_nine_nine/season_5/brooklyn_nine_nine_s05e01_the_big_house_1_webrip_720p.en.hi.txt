Well, I am excited
to join...

339
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:00,536
ISIS.

340
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:04,007
- I can't believe I went
0 for 16.

341
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,509
I got rejected
by my safety gang.

342
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,378
I'm gonna die in here.

343
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:10,013
- Well, there is
one more option,

344
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,714
but it's a long shot.
Remember that guy Romero

345
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:13,716
who you got the cell phone from?
If you got in good

346
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:16,386
with his crew,
nobody would dare touch you.

347
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:18,654
But he is real scary and crazy.

348
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,556
- Okay,
and how anti-Semitic is he?

349
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,460
- Average?
- Then let's give it a shot!

350
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,697
- So, Picante Beef,
I hear you wanna be

351
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,732
part of my crew.
- Not ideally the nickname

352
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:31,467
I would've chosen for myself,
but yes,

353
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,069
I think I could be
of help to you.

354
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:35,138
- Do you know how long
I've been in this prison?

355
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,308
17 years!

356
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,043
- Well, you look great.
- And not once,

357
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,578
in all of that time, Beefy...
- It's just "Beefy" now?

358
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:45,748
- Have I ever seen anything
as disrespectful

359
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:49,319
as a cop coming into my prison

360
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,421
telling me how to eat my soups!

361
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,591
But damn!

362
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,528
Crumbling the noodle on top
gives it an extra

363
00:12:58,561 --> 00:12:59,729
little crispity-snap!

364
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:02,032
I was blown away.
Wasn't I, Tank?

365
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,733
- Hasn't stopped talking
about it.

366
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,002
- Come here, Beef Baby!
- [chuckles]

367
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:10,540
Great.
So, does this mean

368
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,343
that I'm part of the crew?
- Nobody can touch you now.

369
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,545
- Wow, guess all it took
was the ramen tip.

370
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:17,113
- Actually, you gotta do
one more thing for me

371
00:13:17,147 --> 00:13:19,049
to close the deal.
- Absolutely no problem.

372
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:21,051
Actually, I have a great idea
for a ramen dessert.

373
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:24,687
You make it with Jell-O mix.
- I need you to kill a guard.

374
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,090
- [strained] Oh... okay.
Great.

375
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,691
Cool-cool-cool-cool,
cool-cool-cool.

376
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,427
Beef Baby's out for blood.
[laughs]

377
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:32,528
So...

378
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,034
- Okay... this guard
you're gonna kill, Wilson—

379
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,402
- Oh, I'd rather not
know his name.

380
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:41,204
- It's Alan Wilson.
He's got a three-year-old,

381
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,472
Dexter.
They call him Dex.

382
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:44,274
- Cool.
I'm not worried at all

383
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:45,775
about little Dex.
I'm sure he'll be fine.

384
00:13:45,808 --> 00:13:47,310
I mean, I grew up without a dad.
- Yeah?

385
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,079
Me too.
- So did I.

386
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:50,213
- See?
And we're all doing great.

387
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,814
Can I ask what this Wilson did

388
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,349
to deserve this?
- He beat the crap out of me.

389
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,085
- How?
- More importantly, he keeps

390
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,220
interfering
with my business interests.

391
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,488
- But it's about my thing too,
right?

392
00:13:58,521 --> 00:13:59,789
- Of course.

393
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:01,491
[mouths word]

394
00:14:01,524 --> 00:14:04,794
How are you gonna do it?
Shiv him, shank him, stab him?

395
00:14:04,827 --> 00:14:07,130
- Are those different?

396
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,399
- Oh, boy.
Should I be asking

397
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,367
someone else to do this?
- No, no, no, no.

398
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,103
It's fine.
I'm gonna prove myself to you.

399
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:16,072
But what if instead
of killing Wilson,

400
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,607
we get him fired?
That way, you don't have

401
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,142
another man's death
on your conscience.

402
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,410
- Yeah, that doesn't bother me.

403
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,112
- No, of course not.
Why would it?

404
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:23,613
But if we murder him,
there's gonna be

405
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:25,315
an investigation, and that could
bring a lot of heat

406
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,117
down on you, you know?
- I can see that.

407
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,384
But that's not how we usually
do things around here.

408
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,120
- Sure, but you know what else

409
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:31,621
you didn't used to do
around here...

410
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,589
Sprinkle uncooked noodles
on top of your ramen.

411
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,530
- You're right.
You're right.

412
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,632
You've earned the benefit
of the doubt.

413
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,600
You have 24 hours, Beef Baby.

414
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,137
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

415
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,271
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

416
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,405
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

417
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:50,540
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.

418
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,375
- Jake.
- Beef. Baby!

419
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,878
- Beef Baby.

420
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,280
[whispering]
Okay, here's the plan.

421
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,115
Tank said Wilson beats up
inmates,

422
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,550
so all I have to do
is get him to attack me

423
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,385
and then file a complaint
with the prison board.

424
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:04,554
- Sure, but whenever
the bulls attack us—

425
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:07,123
which happens all the time—
the security cameras

426
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,558
are conveniently
not working that day,

427
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,860
so it's just
your word against theirs.

428
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,396
- Well, lucky for me,
I have my own camera.

429
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,498
It's the perfect plan.
Hey, I've never

430
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,133
been beaten up by
a prison guard before.

431
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,568
They don't use that baton,
do they?

432
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,303
- You seem pretty committed
to this plan,

433
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,172
so there's no real benefit
to me answering.

434
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,339
- Sounds good.

435
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:24,707
- So, you painted my apartment?

436
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,177
- Walls in "White Wisp,"
trim in "Honeymilk."

437
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,544
- And you filed my taxes.
- You're getting

438
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,346
your maximum refund.
- And picked up

439
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,215
my abuela at the airport?
- Yes, I went and got her

440
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:34,417
at the Philadelphia
International Airport in...

441
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,252
Pennsylvania.
- And you broke the news to her

442
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,720
about how I got sent to prison
and she'll probably die

443
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,422
before I get out?
- Mm-hmm, had that

444
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:40,890
fun conversation.
- But it was all worth it

445
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:43,526
for you, you poor little
caged bird.

446
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:45,328
- Great, because I have another
favor to ask.

447
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,629
- Another?
- Yeah, I need you

448
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,130
to cancel my cable.

449
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:50,700
- That's it?

450
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:54,470
That's easy.

451
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,172
I've been on the phone
for six hours

452
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,174
and I just wanna cancel
an account.

453
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,475
Yes, you've mentioned
the bundles

454
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:01,344
and I don't want
home phone service.

455
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,679
No, do not transfer me,
Rodrigo—no, no!

456
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,516
No, Rodrigo!

457
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,218
- All right, there's Wilson.

458
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:10,253
I'll go make him mad.
When he attacks me,

459
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:12,188
you film it.
Then afterwards,

460
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,723
we'll meet up in the bathroom.
- Okay, great.

461
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:14,924
What are you gonna do
to get him angry?

462
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,392
- Well, I don't know him,

463
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:17,627
so I'm not sure
what buttons to push,

464
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,529
but I'm sure if I try
enough things,

465
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,198
something will set him off.

466
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,699
Excuse me,
can I ask you a question?

467
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,601
- Get back to your table.
- Yeah, you know, I would,

468
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:27,637
except for...
[grunts]

469
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,472
Oh, my God, that's all it took?
- I told you

470
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,207
to get back to your table!

471
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,709
[thwacking, grunting]

472
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,545
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

473
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,380
What hurts the most is knowing

474
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,781
that prisoners are treated
this way every day

475
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:40,416
in our penal system...
also, he kicked me

476
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,252
in the wiener a bunch.
- Mm.

477
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,653
- Show me the video.
I'll send it to Charles,

478
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:45,555
he'll say he got it anonymously,
and then...

479
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,757
[grunting, shouting]
Oh, my God, that's all it took?

480
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,460
Caleb, is this it?
Did you film yourself

481
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:51,694
the whole time?
- Okay, look, I've been

482
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:53,763
in prison for 15 years.
I'm not good

483
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,631
with new technology.
- [sighs]

484
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,267
- You want somebody
to lure a kid to a park

485
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,602
using a Lycos chatroom,
I'm your man.

486
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:01,504
- Look, just press this button

487
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:04,340
and make it front-facing.
Come on, let's try it again.

488
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:05,775
Hey, Wilson...

489
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:09,512
- [grunts]
- [shouting]

490
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,813
Please tell me you were pointed

491
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,415
in the right direction
that time.

492
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,817
- Yes, but there was
a different issue.

493
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,420
[shouting, grunting]

494
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,290
- Caleb!
You added the fiesta filter?

495
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:22,558
- I'm doing the best I can.
- Tell that to my wiener!

496
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:25,361
- I'm doing the—
- No, don't really—gosh...

497
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,729
[thwacking, screaming]

498
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:29,599
Okay, how'd you
screw it up this time?

499
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,434
- I didn't.
I got everything.

500
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,303
I even zoomed in
for some close-ups.

501
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:35,305
- Oh, thank God.

502
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,373
I was so sure that something
was gonna go wrong.

503
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:38,741
- Hey there, Peralta.

504
00:17:38,774 --> 00:17:42,278
Oh, I'll take that phone now.
- [sighs]

505
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:47,850
- I heard an inmate and a guard
were having a fight,

506
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:49,719
so I go to do
what I normally do:

507
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,887
turn off the security cameras.
- Yup, cool policy.

508
00:17:51,921 --> 00:17:53,689
This place is great.
- And that's when I noticed

509
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:55,958
your cannibal pal
taping the whole fight

510
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,993
with an illegal cell phone.
And what were you planning

511
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,396
on doing with this?
Blackmailing Wilson?

512
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,997
- No, I was trying
to save his life.

513
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,699
- Ah, come on.
- Honestly.

514
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,034
I was ordered by this guy,
Romero.

515
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,769
I don't know his first name.
- Jeff?

516
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,070
- Really?
Romero's first name is Jeff?

517
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,939
- Yeah.
- Anyway, Jeff ordered me

518
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,441
to kill Wilson,
but I convinced him to let

519
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:13,343
your guy live if
I got him fired instead.

520
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,077
- Why do you want him
to lose his job?

521
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,046
He's a good man with a family.
- I mean, he did stomp

522
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,315
on my head a bunch of times.
- Those were warning stomps.

523
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,417
What are you,
part of Romero's crew now?

524
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:23,786
- No, I was trying to get in.
That's what the video was for,

525
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,388
but obviously, it didn't work.
- All right.

526
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,725
I'll fire Wilson.
- Really?

527
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,461
Why?
- Romero's responsible

528
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:33,329
for most of the illegal stuff
that goes on in this prison.

529
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,930
I've always wanted a man
on the inside.

530
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:36,899
- Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

531
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:38,901
The only people less popular
in here than cops are snitches.

532
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,403
- Well, let's be honest,

533
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:41,771
it's not great in here
for trans people.

534
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,105
- That is so true.
- I know.

535
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:45,475
They have a hard time.
- It's a problem.

536
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:47,910
Regardless, I won't snitch,
okay?

537
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,779
It's too dangerous.
I'll find some other way

538
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:50,880
to stay alive.
- All right.

539
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,014
Good luck with that.

to cancel my cable?

It was easy.

The only one that is acting
