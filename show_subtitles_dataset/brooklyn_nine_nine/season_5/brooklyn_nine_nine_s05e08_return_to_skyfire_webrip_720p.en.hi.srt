1
00:00:02,386 --> 00:00:03,387
- Hey, Jake,

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,721
guess who just called me?

3
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:05,822
- The Jerky Boys.
They're back!

4
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:06,890
- No.
What?

5
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,792
No.
- No.

6
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:11,328
- D.C. Parlov.
He's in town for LegendCon,

7
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:12,796
and he has a case for us!

8
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:13,897
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

9
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,332
- Parlov?
Didn't he write

10
00:00:15,366 --> 00:00:16,800
those "Skyfire" books?

11
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,635
I thought he turned out
to be a jerk.

12
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:19,836
- Yeah, but ever since
Jake and I saved his life,

13
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,405
he's actually been very nice.

14
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,906
He even sent me
a Christmas gift.

15
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,743
A full-scale replica
of the sword of Opadoma.

16
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,412
- Unh!
- Why are you so excited?

17
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,381
You don't care
about those stupid books.

18
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:31,782
- I actually did read
all of them in prison.

19
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,116
They are the greatest books
I've ever read,

20
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,685
and I've read "Cujo."

21
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,620
- Jake and I really bonded
over "Skyfire."

22
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,121
- Yeah.
- Watch this.

23
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:39,590
Favorite moment
in the series?

24
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,425
both:
The summoning of Balacastro.

25
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,126
- Second favorite?

26
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,628
both: The Scarlet Feast!
- Third favorite?

27
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:46,430
both:
When you thought Ka'lar

28
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,631
had been swallowed
by the Norolith,

29
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:49,366
but had just switched armor

30
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,767
with Samling the Betrayer

31
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,436
in the battle of Vorcastle.

32
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,937
[laughter]
- Fourth favorite?

33
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,906
- Three was plenty.
So was zero.

34
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:57,674
- Okay, I can see
that you're skeptical, Rosa,

35
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,876
but how about this:
come with us on the case!

36
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,945
I know you think it's dumb,
but "Skyfire" is actually

37
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,947
very smart and dark and adult.

38
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,449
It's not for nerds at all.

39
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,850
Ooh!
On our way there,

40
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:07,884
should we sing
the elvish hunting song?

41
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:09,586
- [laughs]

42
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,721
both: * Sharpen your swords

I wonder if it's as gross
as the books say it is.

- I can never get into

I think the reason
is because it's garbage.

- Real diverse

00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:08,011
And honestly, Wikipedia.

66
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,946
- I always try
to pull from life.

Queen Tiffany, of course,
was named after

68
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:12,883
a lovely hostess that I met

69
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,818
in Bonita Springs
in Florida.

70
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,820
- You know, I've always wanted
to write a book myself,

71
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,022
but all I know about is cops,
and there are literally

72
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,824
no more cop stories to tell.
Zero.

73
00:02:20,857 --> 00:02:21,825
- I've actually been
writing a novel.

00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:23,627
- Wait, what?

75
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,861
You're writing a book?
When? For who?

76
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,530
- For me—for fun.

77
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,998
Look, I'm not trying
to be an author.

78
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,600
I don't even know
how to go about doing that.

79
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,602
- Parlov! You should show it
to Parlov.

80
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:32,636
He could probably
get it published.

81
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:34,805
- No, that's crazy.

82
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:37,541
Like, I'm sure it's bad.
I don't want to be embarrassed.

83
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,009
- Terry,
you are a great husband,

84
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,877
father, detective,
painter, dancer,

85
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,746
and you're so jacked
you have muscles on your back.

86
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,815
- Everyone has back muscles,
Jake.

87
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:46,550
- Nuh-huh, my back looks like
the inside of a spoon.

88
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,851
The point is,
you're great at everything.

89
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:49,653
You're probably great
at writing, too.

90
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:50,854
- I am not showing Parlov
my book, okay?

91
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:53,256
- All right.

92
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:56,527
- Here he comes.
Now just drop it.

93
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,695
- Sorry, I hope that wasn't
too tedious for you.

94
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,531
- It was fascinating,
especially to Terry.

95
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:01,698
He's a writer,
and he wrote a book.

96
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:02,966
Would you read it?
both: Dude!

97
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:04,835
- Sure.
Love to, absolutely.

98
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,269
But listen, there's something
I want you to see.

99
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:07,838
Come with me, guys, all right?

100
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,606
- Jake!
- What?

101
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,241
Terry, you need to believe
in yourself,

102
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,577
like when Morzak answered
the sorceress' riddle!

103
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,811
- She turned him into a tree,
Jake.

104
00:03:14,845 --> 00:03:16,079
- Yeah, a tree that became

105
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,714
the handle of Prominius' axe.

106
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:19,583
- Parlov is so far away
already.

107
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,851
- Yeah, good call.
Let's go after him.

108
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:22,619
- [knocks at door]
Hey.

109
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:23,654
The desk sergeant said
we're hosting

110
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:24,855
a forensic sciences course.

111
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:27,724
- Yes,
taught by Dr. Ronald Yee.

112
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:30,093
- He revolutionized the field
of forensic entomology.

113
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,995
He is a rock star.

114
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:33,930
- Oh, please.
Rock stars wish they were he.

115
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,699
The man can tell how long
a corpse had been decomposing

116
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:37,701
just by studying
the maggots inside.

117
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,002
I'd like to see
Barbra Streisand do that.

118
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:40,036
- I'm not sure
Barbra Streisand

119
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,938
counts as a rock star, sir.

120
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,707
- She sings in English.
That's rock music.

121
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,076
- Well, it sounds interesting.
Can I sign up?

122
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,745
- [sighs]
Yes, you can,

123
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:51,281
but here's the thing:
if we do well at this course,

124
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,883
we receive board certification,

125
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,018
which makes us eligible
to receive a grant

126
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:56,987
to open a field lab
in the precinct,

127
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,022
but...

128
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:02,659
- Eh—but whenever we have
a speaker come in,

129
00:04:02,693 --> 00:04:04,695
you kind of tend to always

130
00:04:04,728 --> 00:04:06,897
derail these things
with personal stories.

131
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,298
- That's how I learn.
I relate course material

132
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,766
to my experiences.

133
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,134
- Subjective learning.

134
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,869
Millennials.

135
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:14,037
- I know it's important,
so I promise,

136
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,639
I won't tell any stories,

137
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,340
though sometimes
they do come in handy.

138
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:18,942
One time,
all the Boyles were in

139
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:20,811
this fungus cavern, and this
massive mushroom comes—

140
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,145
- Charles.
- I am so sorry.

141
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,313
I slipped right into it.

142
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,848
I'll be good.

143
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,717
- This is my room,
right over here.

144
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,151
Listen, I need just a moment
to clean up.

145
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,086
I had a female visitor
in earlier today

146
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,722
dressed as Concubina.

147
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:33,089
She got smears of
green body paint

148
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:34,791
all over everything.

149
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:36,893
Everything.

150
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,631
- He was talking
about his penis.

151
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:41,832
- I know, Jake.
- He pulls, Rosa.

152
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,767
He pulls.
That's all I'm saying.

153
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,701
- I can't believe you told him
about my book.

154
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,737
- I'm sorry, Terry, but now

155
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,804
D.C. Parlov is going to
read what you wrote!

156
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,172
How cool is that?

157
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,807
- He's pretty cool.
- Right?

158
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:52,743
You haven't even told me
what it's about yet.

159
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:54,077
- Well, it's the story
of a Gorgon warrior...

160
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,879
- Awesome.
- Who betrays his bloodline...

161
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:57,681
- How could he?
- To marry a Cloud Princess...

162
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,882
- He did it for love.
- Even though

163
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:00,817
their families are at war.
- No!

164
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:02,085
All right, no more spoilers.
Send it over to me,

165
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:03,887
and I'm gonna stay up
all night reading it.

166
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,355
- It's only 150 pages.
- I'm gonna stay up

167
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,823
all the next three nights
reading it.

168
00:05:06,857 --> 00:05:08,659
- Dr. Yee will be here
any minute,

169
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:09,826
and we need to make
a good impression.

170
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,828
If you need to cough...

171
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,096
cough now.

172
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,898
- [coughing obnoxiously]

173
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:16,900
- My God, what if I hadn't
said anything?

174
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,168
- Don't worry, I got this.

175
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:19,836
Nobody sucks up like a Boyle.

176
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,672
Our scoliosis allows us

177
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:23,674
to bow more deeply
than normal people.

178
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:25,842
- Huh, here's an idea:
Santiago and I will impress him

179
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:27,077
with the depth of our
forensic knowledge,

180
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,680
and you can wow him

181
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:31,982
with your stoic,
silent demeanor.

182
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,717
No stories.
Understood?

183
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,085
- Stoic.
Ah.

184
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,987
- Good morning, everyone.

185
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,655
Thank you for having me
at the Nine-Nine.

186
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,123
Sorry I'm late.
Just had to deal

187
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,725
with some family issues.

188
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,927
Cousins, right?

189
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,796
Okay, before we get technical,

190
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:46,997
let's talk a bit
about the history of blood.

191
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,065
Does anyone here
know any hemophiliacs?

192
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,433
- [whispering]
So many...

193
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:51,968
- Now, they played a vital role

194
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,036
in the development
of modern forensics.

195
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,105
Them and leeches.

196
00:05:55,138 --> 00:05:56,740
- My cousin Torvald
is a hemophiliac,

197
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,709
and his wife is a leech farmer.

198
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:00,243
I say "wife,"
but it's a common-law marriage.

199
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,912
For the longest time,
Boyle wedding ceremonies

200
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,246
were not recognized
in the state.

201
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,148
- Well, here's the situation:

202
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,883
somebody stole my laptop,

203
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,785
which contained
the unpublished manuscript

204
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,921
of book 13 of
"The Skyfire Cycle."

205
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,757
The person left this note.

206
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,425
- "We have your book.

207
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,460
"Pay us $500,000
in the next 24 hours

208
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:19,162
"or we leak it online.

209
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:21,031
The first five chapters
are now up."

210
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:22,933
- They've been downloaded
85,000 times.

211
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,035
- Well, we should probably
go online

212
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,170
and read those chapters in case
there's some clues in there,

213
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:29,439
and also maybe we'll find out
Qwandor's true parentage?

214
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,807
- Oh that's already
been revealed.

215
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,275
- No, it hasn't.
[gasps]

216
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,476
both:
Unless the prophecy of Dorgon

217
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,045
is indeed true!

218
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:36,713
But that would mean—

219
00:06:36,747 --> 00:06:37,781
- You seem pretty calm
for somebody

220
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,915
whose book was just stolen.

221
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,050
- Because I know
who took it.

222
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,752
Landon Lawson.

223
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:43,053
- He was on that panel.
He writes

224
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:45,088
"The Shadowbringer Saga."
It's garbage.

225
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:46,923
- So why would Lawson
want to steal your manuscript?

226
00:06:46,957 --> 00:06:48,124
- We both have books
coming out this fall,

227
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,793
and we have a rather public bet

228
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,194
about whose is going
to sell better.

229
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:52,929
I believe he's leaking
my manuscript online

230
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:54,931
just to hurt my sales.

231
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,466
You should arrest him.
- Well, we're not going to

232
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,968
do anything until we've seen
all the evidence.

233
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,135
- If this book fails,

234
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,804
that's the end of "Skyfire."

235
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,206
- Let's go take
this son of a bitch down!

236
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,809
Mr. Lawson?
NYPD.

237
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,078
- Let me guess: you're here
about the stolen manuscript?

238
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:11,214
- So you admit you did it?
Well, that was easy.

239
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,249
- What? No.
Someone stole my manuscript,

240
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:14,918
and I know who it was:

241
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,953
D.C. Parlov.

242
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:18,855
both: By Zorton's Sword!

243
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,326
- It's the exact same note
Parlov got.

244
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,128
- I don't see why anybody
would want to steal your book.

245
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,030
"The Skyfire Cycle" makes
"The Shadowbringer Saga"

246
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,431
look like
"The BeastWorm Chronicles."

247
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:30,200
- You see, Rosa,
"The BeastWorm Chronicles"

248
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,401
are one of the more
simplistic—

249
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:33,136
- Don't care.
- Yeah.

250
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,305
- You know what?
My books say something, okay?

251
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,207
I was the only one brave enough
to tackle elf molestation.

252
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,876
- Guys, calm down.
You're both victims.

253
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,045
Now, do you have
any enemies in common?

254
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,880
- Let me think about that.
Parlov is my enemy,

255
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,348
but he's also his own enemy,

256
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,250
because he's such a boring
and repetitive writer.

257
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:49,219
He just keeps
killing off characters,

258
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,087
resurrecting them,
and killing 'em off again.

259
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:52,222
- Because of the Chrysalis Orb!

260
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,323
Uh, sorry.

261
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,058
Police officer, on a case.

262
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:56,927
But we will need you
to both generate

263
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,261
actual lists of people
that might want to hurt you.

264
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:00,230
- We have 24 hours
to figure this out,

265
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:01,832
but if we don't, are you
willing to pay the ransom?

266
00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:03,266
- I'd do anything
to get my book back.

267
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,135
I mean, you understand.
You're a writer.

268
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:07,170
- Do you hear that, Terry?
He called you a writer.

269
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:09,305
Terry, did you hear?
Terry?

270
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,907
Well, Terry's broken.
Write up those lists.

271
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,442
We're on the case.

272
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:14,244
- Welcome back.

273
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:15,846
So today, I want to focus on

274
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,413
facial reconstruction.

275
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:19,415
For over a century,
we used plaster casts

276
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:22,052
to help identify decomposed
John and Jane Does.

277
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,354
- We buried my Nana Boyle
at the family farm,

278
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,389
but because of the soil's
high salt content,

279
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,991
she turned into jerky.

280
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,259
Never mind.
Please continue.

281
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:31,161
- Now, I need one person
per group

282
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,395
to have a plaster cast
made of their head.

283
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:36,132
- Uh, will he—or she—
be able to speak?

284
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,200
- Not while the plaster's on,
no.

285
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,368
- I vote Charles.
- Charles.

286
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,370
- I was gonna vote me, too.

287
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,072
I mean, I know the plaster
can dry out your skin,

288
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,506
but as a Boyle,
I'm aggressively moist.

289
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,109
- Oop, you gotta close
that mouth, Boyle.

290
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:47,978
- Shh-shh-shh-shh.

291
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:50,246
Keep still and quiet.

292
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,516
- Have you been here
all night?

293
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,418
- We traded off,
and each slept a few hours

294
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,419
right here in the break room,

295
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,988
but we got a lead.

296
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,422
You know Miles Moorgil?

297
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,491
He wrote
"The Nocturine Quartet" novels.

298
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:03,493
Well,
Moorgil is the only person

299
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:07,297
on both Parlov and Lawson's
lists of potential enemies.

300
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,399
Apparently, they each slept
with his wife.

301
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:12,002
- How do these guys
do so well with women?

302
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,436
- Oh, I'm sorry
they don't live up to

303
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,238
your superficial standards
of male beauty, Rosa.

304
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:16,506
I'm kidding.
It's because they're rich.

305
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:18,541
- Moorgil's here
for the conference.

306
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:20,543
We're gonna go confront him
and get the laptops back.

307
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,913
Then, maybe, we can see if

308
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,380
Parlov read my book yet.

309
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:26,416
- Oh, well, I mean,
it's been less than a day.

310
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,318
Maybe don't get your hopes up.

311
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,986
- Don't worry.
I don't have any expectations.

312
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,387
- Good.
- I'm gonna be at my phone,

313
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:34,024
just in case a publisher calls.
I mean, someone.

314
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:35,926
Yeah.
Whatever.

315
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,260
It's fine.
My hopes are up.

316
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,262
- All right, buddy.

317
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,097
I couldn't sleep last night,
so I started

318
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,066
reading Terry's book,
and it's terrible.

319
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:45,068
I made him show it to Parlov.
He's gonna be humiliated.

320
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,037
- Relax.
How bad could it be?

321
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,571
- So bad, and I'm entertained
by everything.

322
00:09:48,604 --> 00:09:50,440
I once went to a play.

323
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:51,307
- So what are you gonna do
about Parlov?

324
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,076
- I don't know.

325
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:54,077
- Don't know what?
- Uh, how to do...

326
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,146
sex... good.

327
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,048
How much should I be
flapping my arms around?

328
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,082
- Not much.
- Right.

329
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:00,350
Well, that settles that.

330
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,485
I knew that Amy was wrong.
[chuckles]

331
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,987
Anyways, let's get back
on the case, right?

332
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,189
Skyfire Cycle.

333
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,424
- Okay, now that
the plaster's dry,

334
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,126
you'll see why we lubricated
the subject's face

335
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,395
with Vaseline first.

336
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,065
- Oh, no, we forgot the lube.

337
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:17,233
- Charles, can you hear us?

338
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,435
What do we do?

339
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,337
- Doctor?
Uh, what if someone—

340
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,339
no one in this room, mind you—

341
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,109
forgot to lubricate
before applying the plaster?

342
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,577
- Oh, one of my lab techs
made that mistake once.

343
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,445
It becomes impossible
to remove the mask

344
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,247
without literally skinning
the subject alive.

345
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:33,116
It takes five days
for the plaster

346
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:34,317
to slough off
on its own.

347
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,052
- And what became
of the lab tech?

348
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:37,120
- Oh, I fired him.
It was an unacceptable

349
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,089
level of incompetence.

350
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:41,091
- Huh, what a satisfying
conclusion to that story.

351
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:41,591
- Boyle!
- [muffled] Mm.

352
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,359
- A mistake was made

353
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,095
and we can't
remove your mask yet.

354
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,129
We're gonna leave you
in here...

355
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,597
until after the class is over,

356
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,365
because if Dr. Yee sees you
like this,

357
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,534
we can kiss our certification
good-bye.

358
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,635
- [muffled protest]

359
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:54,137
- I'm sorry, Boyle,

360
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,338
but Hitchcock and Scully

361
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:56,572
will be here with you.

362
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:59,509
- [muffled shouting]

363
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,144
- I don't know, Captain.
He seems pretty upset.

364
00:11:01,177 --> 00:11:02,512
- Hold on.
- [muffled] Mm!

365
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,417
- Look how happy
he is now.

366
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,152
- [muffled groaning]

367
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:10,653
- Yes, you're welcome, Boyle.

368
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,422
- I don't understand.

369
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:14,290
Why do you think
I would steal those laptops?

370
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:16,292
- Parlov and Lawson
are your rivals.

371
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,161
You're jealous
of their success.

372
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:19,562
- And of course,
you have a personal motive.

373
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,365
- You hate them
for sleeping with your wife.

374
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:24,300
- What?
They slept with my wife?

375
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,169
- And you didn't know.
[laughs]

376
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:27,270
Well, this is awkward.
We should probably just go.

377
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:28,571
- Jessica!
- She's here.

378
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,340
That's wonderful.
- Yes, sweets?

379
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:31,541
- Did you sleep with

380
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,277
D.C. Parlov and Landon Lawson?

381
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,379
- Uh...
- Why would you do that?

382
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:38,448
You've ruined our marriage.
You've ruined it!

383
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:39,315
- You know, this seems like
a conversation

384
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,583
for just you two,

385
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,118
so—oop,
here comes a child.

386
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:43,219
- Mommy?
Daddy?

387
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,221
Are you getting divorced?

388
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,057
Are they getting divorced?

389
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,392
both: Uh...

390
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:51,161
- Oof.

391
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:52,295
Okay, that was a rough
70 minutes.

392
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,064
- Yeah, but...

393
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:54,564
- That kid looked exactly
like Parlov?

394
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,631
- 100%.

395
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:57,400
both: Oh...

396
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,469
- Anyways,
that was our last lead,

397
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:02,138
so looks like we're back
at the Nil Caverns.

398
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:03,606
- Did you just say
the Nil Caverns?

399
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,341
- Hm?

400
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,543
- Like, from my book?
- Uh, yep.

401
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,445
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I did,
because you told me about them

402
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,414
when you were
explaining the plot.

403
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:12,648
- I didn't, but that's because
I wanted the Nil Caverns

404
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:14,684
to be a surprise.

405
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:16,652
Why didn't you tell me
you read my book, Jake?

406
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,354
- Uh...
- Oh, no.

407
00:12:18,388 --> 00:12:19,355
You hated it.
- What?

408
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:22,092
Terry, no, I didn't hate it.

409
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,393
I liked tons of parts.

410
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:25,095
- Name one.

411
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,596
Name one part you liked, Jake.

412
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:28,098
- The map?

413
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:29,365
- I didn't draw that!

414
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,666
It was a map
of the Chesapeake Bay

415
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,302
with the names
slightly changed!

416
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,171
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

417
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:36,706
You made me show Parlov.

418
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,276
You humiliated me
in front of my hero!

419
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,445
- Sarge, I'm sorry.

420
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:43,513
Look,
I didn't just like the map.

421
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,181
I also liked...

422
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,116
the spaces between the words!

423
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,016
That's not helpful.

424
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,787
- You guys got
a million dollars together

425
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,623
on 24 hours' notice?

426
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:55,325
- Yeah, I had to liquidate
my Bitcoins.

427
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,726
- Oh, really?

428
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,328
I would've thought
you'd be flushed with cash

429
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,462
from the "Skyfire" TV series.

430
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:00,696
Oh, wait, that's right.

431
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,532
The CW passed.

432
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,434
- How's the "Shadowbringer"
film coming along?

433
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,336
Howie Long still playing
both twins?

434
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,371
- All right.
Let's go over the plan.

435
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,140
- Okay, there's a potted tree
on the east side of the lobby.

436
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,707
They said to leave
the briefcase behind that.

437
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:13,676
- If someone grabs it,
Rosa, Peralta, and I

438
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,445
will converge.
We'll be positioned

439
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,313
around the room in disguise.

440
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,649
- It's not gonna work.
I don't own a nerd costume.

441
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:21,851
- Oh, but Rosa,
you are already wearing one.

442
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,654
- You naturally dress
like the female bounty hunter

443
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,789
in every steampunk novel.

444
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:28,658
Look.

445
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:29,859
All you need
are welding goggles.

446
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,627
- Damn it.

447
00:13:31,661 --> 00:13:32,695
I have welding goggles
in the car.

448
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,730
- Shall we to battle?

449
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:37,467
♪ Mask on, mask on

450
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,868
♪ Mask, mask on

451
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,471
♪ Got your mask on, mask on

452
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:44,140
♪ Represent, yeah,
gotta represent ♪

453
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:46,142
- To solve that problem,
we would use

454
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:47,910
fluid dynamic analysis.

455
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,680
- That is exactly right.
Well done.

456
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:52,482
Where's your friend?

457
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,350
Shouldn't he be here
for the plaster removal?

458
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:55,851
- Something came up,
so he had to remove the mask,

459
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,587
which came off quite easily,
and run out.

460
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,422
- It was urgent
police business.

461
00:13:59,455 --> 00:14:00,623
Bunch of kids
are being held hostage,

462
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:01,857
so he had to go
deal with that.

463
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,359
- Oh, well,
if you need to leave

464
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:04,760
to provide him with backup...

465
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:05,861
- No, it's a teachable moment.
- The children

466
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:06,862
can handle themselves.

467
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,164
- Captain Holt?

468
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:09,399
Your husband's on the phone.

469
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,766
He wants to know how long

470
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,469
you're going to kiss
for tonight?

471
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,838
- Would you excuse us
for one moment?

472
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:17,773
- Your husband
didn't really call.

473
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:18,908
I wasn't sure what
gay guys talk about

474
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,443
on the phone.
How'd I do?

475
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:21,844
- Scully, what do you want?

476
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,913
- We were watching Charles,
like you said,

477
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,615
but both of us had to
go to the bathroom really bad.

478
00:14:25,648 --> 00:14:27,417
- Ugh.
Where's Charles?

479
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,418
- We have no idea.

480
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,852
both: What?

481
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,654
- Terry, do you copy?
- I copy.

482
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,489
- Seriously?
You're still mad at me?

483
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:34,857
- All I said was "I copy."

484
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,726
- Yeah, but you had a tone.
Just admit it.

485
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:37,893
- Let it go, Jake.
- No, he's right.

486
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,829
Terry had a tone.

487
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,664
Terry had a big-time tone.
- Don't worry.

488
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:42,932
I bet he hasn't even
read your book yet.

489
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,800
- It's been two hours.
I'm almost

490
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,502
at the front of this line.
I don't even know

491
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:47,603
who I'm waiting
to take a picture with.

492
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,672
"Bran Stark?"
Pass.

493
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,575
- Okay,
he's just the three-eyed raven.

494
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,410
- Here we go, here we go.
We got action.

495
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,478
- He dresses just like you,
Jake.

496
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,679
Is that someone popular?

497
00:14:56,712 --> 00:14:57,680
- Yes, Rosa, it's Ka'lar.

498
00:14:57,713 --> 00:14:58,781
17th of his name, sworn knight

499
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,483
of the Queen's Crown,

500
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:01,817
the Daybreaker,
the rightful heir to—

501
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:04,220
- All right.
You can just say "Ka'lar."

502
00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:05,688
- Uh, then how will you know
which Ka'lar I'm talking about?

503
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,689
It's a very common name
in "Skyfire."

504
00:15:06,722 --> 00:15:08,524
It's like their John.

505
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:09,992
- He's going
for the briefcase.

506
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,961
- Okay, let's go.

507
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,563
- Don't make your move
until you're close to him.

508
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:15,231
There's too many civilians.

509
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:17,700
[tense music]

510
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,969
- Wait, why are there
so many Ka'lars?

511
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,238
- Costume contest
just ended.

512
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:23,773
That's why he waited until now
to pick up the money.

513
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,708
- I lost him.
Which one is it?

514
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:26,809
- It's the one headed toward
the service elevator.

515
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,444
- Hey!
Freeze!

516
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:29,011
NYPD.
Let me see your hands.

517
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:31,514
- What's going on?

518
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,983
- Doesn't have the briefcase.
I got the wrong Ka'lar.

519
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,451
- I have eyes on him.
- Take him down!

520
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:37,453
- [grunts]

521
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:40,623
- Wrong Ka'lar...

522
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:42,858
- Boyle's not
in the interrogation room.

523
00:15:42,892 --> 00:15:44,794
- He couldn't have gotten far.
He can't see.

524
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:46,596
- You can go a long way
on muscle memory alone.

525
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:47,997
One time, I sleepwalked

526
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,499
to the M&M's store
in Times Square.

527
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:49,999
[loud banging]
- Oh, oh!

528
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,768
- Stairwell.

529
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:53,769
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

530
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:54,870
- I'm okay.

531
00:15:54,904 --> 00:15:55,871
It's okay.
[screams]

532
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:57,607
Sorry, stranger.

533
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,874
I just can't see anything
at all,

534
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,776
and it's really scary
being touched.

535
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,645
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

536
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:03,913
Just return me
to the 99th precinct.

537
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,815
- Boyle, it's us.

538
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,683
Where were you going?
Why would you leave

539
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,285
that windowless supply closet
we locked you in?

540
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,721
Ah, yes, hearing it,
I understand why.

541
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,022
- I was trying to get
to the locker room

542
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,757
to steam the mask off
in the shower

543
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,659
so you guys could
still get certified.

544
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:17,827
- Wait.

545
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,962
You were trying to help us?

546
00:16:19,995 --> 00:16:21,664
Even though you'll be stuck
in this mask for five days?

547
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:23,666
- Five days?

548
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,635
Well, I know how important
the course was to you.

549
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,503
- It's not.

550
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:29,305
Not anymore.
- [screams]

551
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,940
I'm so sorry.

552
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,576
I just cannot see at all.

553
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:34,777
- I can't believe it!

554
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,912
Now I'm out $1/2 million!

555
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,714
What am I supposed to do now?

556
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,550
Write another
"Compendium of Beasts"?

557
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,051
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

558
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,888
to find enough interns
to slap that crap together?

559
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,922
God!

560
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:48,758
- Don't worry about him.

561
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,660
At least we got
to stop that thief

562
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,328
from releasing
any more chapters.

563
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:53,963
All we're out is some money,
plus I've got insurance,

564
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:55,531
so I'm going to
get it all back.

565
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:56,532
By the way, Detective Jeffords,

566
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:58,033
while we were waiting,

567
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,669
I had an opportunity
to read your manuscript.

568
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:01,537
- Oh, don't worry about that.

569
00:17:01,571 --> 00:17:03,373
It's a work in progress.

570
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:04,940
Has a lot of changes I—

571
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:06,709
- No, no, no, it was great.
Truly.

572
00:17:06,742 --> 00:17:08,811
Fantastic. I mean,
it was so fresh, you know?

573
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,713
It had a really unique
point of view.

574
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,047
I sent it on
to my publishers.

575
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:13,649
Thank you for allowing me
to read it.

576
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,050
And I want to thank you all

577
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,019
for your hard, hard work
on this case.

578
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:18,621
Appreciate it.

579
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:19,989
- [breathing excitedly]

580
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,724
Ooh, did you hear that?

581
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:22,925
He loved it.

582
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,361
D.C. Parlov loved my writing!

583
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,929
You were wrong!

584
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,098
- And being wrong
never felt so right.

585
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,033
Oh, that sounded cool.
Did I just make up a hit song?

586
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:33,403
♪ Being wrong
never felt so right ♪

587
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,738

00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:36,939
Yep, I was right.
It's a hit.

589
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,841
- I gotta go call Sharon!

590
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:40,643
- All righty.
Well, congratulations, Sarge!

591
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:41,777
And don't forget about us

592
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,646
when you become
a famous author.

593
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,615
Terry's writing sucks.
Parlov is lying to him.

594
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,582
- What?
Why?

595
00:17:46,616 --> 00:17:47,983
- I don't know.

596
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:49,919
He's buttering him up...

597
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,821
because Lawson and Parlov

598
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:53,989
stole their own books!

599
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:55,591

605
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,539
- Why do you think these guys
are in it together?

606
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,106
They hate each other.
They spent an hour

607
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,409
arguing over the name
of the dragon in "The Hobbit."

608
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:14,444
- "Smog."
- "Smowg."

609
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:15,878
- Smog!
- Smowg!

610
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:17,613
- [yelling] Smog!
- [yelling] Smowg!

611
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,582
- It's "Smowg," by the way—

612
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,117
point Lawson—but yes,
they're mortal enemies,

613
00:18:22,151 --> 00:18:23,586
which is why they think
we'll never suspect them

614
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:24,887
of being in cahoots.

615
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,522
Oh, but they cahooted, Rosa.

616
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,991
They cahooted all over us.

617
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,526
- Gross.
Why'd they leak their chapters?

618
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,628
- To get people excited,

619
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:34,830
like when Carly Rae Jepsen
puts out an amazing single,

620
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,098
and you have to wait six weeks
for the album to come out.

621
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:37,667
She's great.
I'm not apologizing.

622
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,569
- So Parlov contacted Terry
because he knows

623
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:41,471
Sarge is a super-fan
and can be manipulated.

624
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:43,473
- Yes, he's been giving Terry
presents since last year.

625
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:44,840
- And Terry's novel gave Parlov

626
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:45,841
another chance
to manipulate him.

627
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,643
Unless...

628
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:49,912
is it possible Parlov actually
likes Sarge's writing?

629
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,914
- Read the first sentence.

630
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,583
- Yep, Parlov did it.
- Very much so.

631
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,585
Gah!
Now I have to tell Sarge

632
00:18:55,618 --> 00:18:57,887
that his fantasy novel stinks.

633
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,556
This is the hardest part
of being a cop.

634
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,658
- Now, there are issues
with RFLP testing,

635
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:04,960
as there are
with every technique, but...

636
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,862
Captain, I thought you said

637
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,598
your friend removed his mask
and left.

638
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,700
- I forgot to lube up his face.

639
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,535
- We failed to listen
to the instructions.

640
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,604
- That is incredibly careless.

641
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,205
- I know, and it means
we won't receive

642
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,940
our certification,
and I'm okay with that.

643
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,975
Unless my honesty—
- No, it's off the table.

644
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:22,011
- And I'm okay with that.

645
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:24,013
- Well, anyway, RFLP testing

646
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:26,015
was designed to localize
genetic disorders, and it—

647
00:19:26,048 --> 00:19:29,018
- Ooh, my cousin Donna
has a genetic disorder

648
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,620
where her lips
were made of cartilage,

649
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,722
meaning her mouth
is technically a beak.

650
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,156
- I don't see how that pertains
to anything—

651
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,025
- No, let him talk.
I want to hear it.

652
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:37,893
Boyle, tell us about
your cousin's beak.

653
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,129
- Well, she runs marathons

654
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:43,032
to raise money for other people
afflicted with "bird-face."

655
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:44,233
There are only two of them.

656
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,067
They're her kids.

657
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,569
- Oh, Sarge!

658
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,603
Funny seeing you here.

659
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:49,939
Oh, that reminds me.

660
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,541
I have to tell you something.
What was it?

661
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:52,975
- Out with it, Peralta.

662
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:54,644
- Okay, fine.
Here it goes.

663
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,746
I think that—
- Parlov hated my book.

664
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,181
He only said he liked it
so I wouldn't figure out

665
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,651
he and Lawson
stole their own manuscripts.

666
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:03,052
- You figured it out.
- Well, I had a gut feeling,

667
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:05,054
so I went digging.

668
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:06,656
I got a warrant
for Parlov's browser history.

669
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,724
He searched
"how to liquidate Bitcoins"

670
00:20:08,758 --> 00:20:10,926
three days before
the laptops were stolen.

671
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,628
- Man, I bet that browser
history was a nightmare, huh?

672
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,196
- Oh, you have no idea.
- Yeah.

673
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:16,198
- Anyway, I questioned them,
and they confessed.

674
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:17,767
- I can't go to prison, okay?

675
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,069
I know I seem tough,
but I'm not.

676
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,571
I went to Bennington.

677
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:22,304
- Ew.
- I'm sorry Parlov

678
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:23,673
didn't like your book.

679
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,274
And I didn't.
And also Rosa.

680
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,176
Why did I add that?
- No, it's okay.

681
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,544
At least I won't waste
any more time

682
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:29,945
trying to be a writer.

683
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,647
- Wait,
let me ask you a question.

684
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,182
Are you a better cop now
than when you started?

685
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:35,618
- Nope.
- Wasn't talking to you.

686
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,987
- Yeah.
I look back at my old cases

687
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,022
and I can't believe how long

688
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:41,156
it took me
to figure things out.

689
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,291
- Yeah, but you worked on it,

690
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,593
and you kept working, and now,

691
00:20:43,626 --> 00:20:45,961
12 to 40 years later—

692
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,597
I don't have a good sense of
your age—

693
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,164
you're a great cop
who got a "gut feeling"

694
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:51,033
and solved a huge case.

695
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,635
- So you think
I should keep writing?

696
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,570
- I mean, you might not
become a huge famous author,

697
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,038
but you'll get better,

698
00:20:56,071 --> 00:20:57,172
and if it makes you happy,

699
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:58,974
it can't be that bad.

700
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,142
Sheryl Crow, she's great.
I won't apologize.

701
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,177
- And who knows?
Claire Essalgorn

702
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:03,579
didn't start writing the first
"Crimson Portal" novel

703
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:06,015
until she was 60.

704
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:07,983
I started reading it because
the character looks like me.

705
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,052
I kept reading it
because it's so good!

706
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,187
- Rosa, you did get hooked,
you big nerd!

707
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,656
- This heroine is my heroin.

708
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,290
- Oh, such a dweebus.
I love it!

709
00:21:15,324 --> 00:21:18,027
- Speaking of which,
Parlov's laptop is in evidence.

710
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,061
Want to go read
the new "Skyfire" book?

711
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:21,063
- Oh, I don't know.

712
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:23,032
I mean, he's such a bad guy.

713
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:24,600
Do we even like his books
anymore?

714
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,736
[chuckles]

715
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:27,737
both:
♪ Sharpen your swords

716
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,204
♪ And string your bows

717
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:30,806
♪ The beasts have gone away

718
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,775
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
