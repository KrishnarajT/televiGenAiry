- Actually, scratch that,
they're here.

This is happening and I need
you to be here with me

and do it for me.

a very bad idea.

comfortable—

my nervous rambling.

I called it fútbol.

But secondly,

They're brides.
They're in love.

516
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,670
Mom, Dad, I know you don't
wanna talk about this

517
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:59,038
but I do.

518
00:16:59,071 --> 00:17:00,172
I might get married to a man—

519
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:01,574
like you so clearly want—

520
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:02,975
and I might not.

521
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:04,544
'Cause this is not a phase.

522
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,879
And I need you
to understand that.

523
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:09,048
I'm bisexual.
- There's no such thing

524
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:10,215
as being bisexual.

525
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:11,751
- Yes, there is.

526
00:17:11,784 --> 00:17:14,654
I know there is
because that's who I am.

527
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,756
I'm attracted to both
men and women.

528
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:18,658
I've known this about myself
for a really long time,

529
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:20,526
and I didn't wanna tell you
because I was afraid

530
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,928
you were gonna react
exactly like you are.

531
00:17:23,796 --> 00:17:27,166
- What do you want us to say?

532
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,835
- That you accept me
for who I am.

533
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:37,309
Wow.

534
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:39,779
Okay, let's go.

535
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:48,087
- Hey. Got you coffee.

536
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,755
- I don't drink coffee.
Just herbal tea.

537
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:51,624
- Oh. That's cool.

538
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:53,025
It only cost me,
like, 18 bucks.

539
00:17:53,058 --> 00:17:54,760
Brooklyn is a nightmare.
- Hey, man, thanks for

540
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:56,195
being there last night.
- Of course.

541
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:58,063
Sorry again about how it all
went down.

542
00:17:58,097 --> 00:17:59,699
- Well, I'm glad
I opened up to them,

543
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:01,567
even if it didn't
change their minds.

544
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:03,603
I finally said
what I wanted to say.

545
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:05,304
It felt right.
- Yeah.

546
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:07,006
Still sucks, though.

547
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,642
- Still sucks.

548
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:10,843
That's weird.
My dad's here.

549
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,311
Hey, do you mind
staying out here

550
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:15,314
with me to talk to him?
- Um, yes, of course.

551
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:16,816
Whatever you need.
- [laughs]

552
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,083
Your face. No, man,
you've done enough.

553
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:19,685
Get out of here.
- Oh, thank God.

554
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,287
Good luck.

555
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,790
Hello.

556
00:18:24,824 --> 00:18:26,191
- What are you doing here?

557
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:27,793
- I wanted to say I'm sorry.

558
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:30,596
I reacted poorly last night.

559
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,332
This is all new to me.
- I know.

560
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:35,868
But it's also not new,
you know.

561
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:37,670
I'm still the same person
I always was.

562
00:18:37,703 --> 00:18:39,171
- Well, I don't feel
I know that person.

563
00:18:39,204 --> 00:18:41,340
- Dad—
- My fault, not yours.

564
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:44,143
I want you to be able
to tell me everything.

565
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:47,079
I can't promise you
I'll understand.

566
00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:49,048
But I'm trying.
I want you to know

567
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,717
that I accept you
for who you are.

568
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:54,987
And I love you very, very much.

569
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,958
- I love you, too.

570
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:05,831
- So have you been
on any dates with women, yet?

571
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:07,199
- Dad, we didn't talk about
my dating life before,

572
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:08,968
we don't need to talk
about it now.

573
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:11,403
- Yeah, good, good.
You're right. [laughs]

574
00:19:11,436 --> 00:19:12,972
- So where's Mom?

575
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:16,108
- Mm—Mom needs
a little more time.

576
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:17,376
- Oof.

577
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:19,979
I guess family game night's
gonna be kinda weird.

578
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,981
- You know what, mijita,
maybe we better

579
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:25,785
put game night on hold
for a little while.

580
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:27,252
- Okay.
- I'm gonna let you

581
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:29,288
get back to work, okay?

582
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:33,893
♪

583
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:35,761
- I expect certain things
from my assistant.

584
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:38,230
Black ink only. No blue.
I'm not a street artist.

585
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:40,099
Also, if you must
knock on my door,

586
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:42,001
limit yourself
to two raps.

587
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:44,136
If I wanted to hear
inane pounding,

588
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,972
I could go see "Stomp."
- He could go see "Stomp."

589
00:19:47,006 --> 00:19:48,741
- Gina.
- Who's this noob?

590
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:50,175
- We had to hire someone
to replace you, Gina,

591
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:51,877
because you quit.
- Well, fire him.

592
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:53,245
'Cause I'm back, baby!

593
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,147
- Really?
- What changed your mind?

594
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,982
Was is the speech that Charles
and I gave you?

595
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,751
- [chuckles] No.
Captain Holt said

596
00:19:58,784 --> 00:20:00,753
he'd give me
a 5% raise if I came back

597
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:02,354
and he's letting me
sit at my desk

598
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,757
and work on my side business
one day a week.

599
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,225
- We never had
that conversation.

600
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:08,327
- We just did, baby.

601
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,062
See ya, man bangs.

602
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,064
- Come, Brent, let's get you
down to HR

603
00:20:12,097 --> 00:20:13,899
before that start paperwork
goes through.

604
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:17,169
Welcome back, Linetti.
- Thanks, man.

605
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:18,203
Ugh!

606
00:20:18,237 --> 00:20:19,839
- All right, look, Gina,
come on.

607
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,440
It's just us now.
Admit it.

608
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:22,808
Amy and I changed your mind.

609
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:24,243
- All right, it was you guys.

610
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:25,911
I actually even
cried a little bit

611
00:20:25,945 --> 00:20:27,246
after you left my apartment.

612
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,081
- Aw.
- Oh! I made Gina Linetti cry?

613
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:31,016
- Hey, calm down.
I had a baby ten weeks ago.

614
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,786
I cried to a carpet cleaner
commercial yesterday.

615
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:35,320
- Gina! Welcome back.

616
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:37,222
It's great to see you.
Hey, what's everybody

617
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:38,924
doing tonight?
- Nothin'. Why?

618
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,325
- There's something
we all need to do.

619
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,061
[knock at door]

620
00:20:42,094 --> 00:20:43,362
- What's going on?
- Family game night!

621
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:45,931
- Don't worry,
I brought "Twister."

622
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:47,366
- Hey.
- Hey, Rosa.

623
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:49,268
- Hey, Rosa. Beer.
- Here goes the snacks.

624
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,203
- Ehh, you know,
in another lifetime,

625
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:53,338
you and I would've made
a hot ass couple.

626
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:56,441
- Agreed.

627
00:20:56,475 --> 00:20:58,343
- Diaz, you should be
very proud of yourself.

628
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,746
I know things aren't exactly
where you wanna be right now,

629
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,348
but, uh, I promise you
they will improve.

630
00:21:03,382 --> 00:21:04,950
- Thank you, Captain.
- Every time

631
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:07,019
someone steps up
and says who they are,

632
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:10,355
the world becomes a better,
more interesting place.

633
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:12,124
So...

634
00:21:12,157 --> 00:21:15,494
thank you.

635
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:18,230
- Hey, do you seriously
only have two wine glasses?

636
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,099
- Yeah. I live alone.
- Well, you're gonna need

637
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:21,533
to get some more, 'cause
there's a lot of us here.

638
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,102
- Thank you
for doing this, man.

639
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:25,070
- Of course. We'll be here
every week.

640
00:21:25,104 --> 00:21:27,873
- Rosa, I broke both your wine
glasses and your fridge door

641
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:29,074
and your bathroom.

642
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:31,143
- Every single week!

643
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:35,147
- Not a doctor. Shh.
