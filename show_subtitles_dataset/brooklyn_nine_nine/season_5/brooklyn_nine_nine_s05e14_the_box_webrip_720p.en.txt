sound a little cooler,

78

So, shall we recap the night

79
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:19,742
that Robert Tupper was murdered
Friday the 22nd?

80
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:20,874
I believe you were
the last person

81
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,440
to see him alive, correct?

82
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,834
- No. I'd imagine whoever
killed him saw him after I did.

83
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,794
- Ooh, nice dodge.
You're quick, like a cat.

84
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:30,231
- Like a dancer.
- Like Great Tiger.

85
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,537
From "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out."

86
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:34,148
He could teleport
around the ring.

87
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:35,366
Most people thought it was
impossible to get past him.

88
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,629
- I beat him every time.

89
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:37,760
You just punch him when
he gets dizzy.

90
00:03:37,804 --> 00:03:39,457
!
I mean, duh.

91
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,416
Everyone knows that.
- Tell us about Friday.

92
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,678
- I had a late afternoon
surgery.

93
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,854
Simple gum graft.
It wrapped around 6:00,

94
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:46,203
and then Robert and I
talked after.

95
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:47,683
- And who else was
in the office?

96
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,076
- Our hygienist
and anesthesiologist

97
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,078
had gone home, and Grace,
who usually locks up,

98
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:53,646
had left early because her
grandson had a school play.

99
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,125
- So it was just
you and Robert.

100
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,823
- That's lucky.

101
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,608
- It wasn't lucky because
there was nothing to witness.

102
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,262
Robert just wanted to talk
about firing

103
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:03,177
one of our office
assistants, Cheryl.

104
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,657
- Yeah.

105
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,962
- Nah.

106
00:04:06,006 --> 00:04:07,181
- Zero other subjects
were mentioned?

107
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,399
- None.
- Not even how gross

108
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:09,531
gum grafts are?

109
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:10,793
- They're really
not that gross.

110
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:11,925
- Liar!
About the gum graft thing,

111
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:13,491
and about the meeting.

112
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:14,971
- We just talked about Cheryl.

113
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,017
- Right. And, of course,
there's no way for me

114
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,540
to check if that's true,
because

115
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,628
because whoever took
Robert's phone

116
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:21,674
wiped all of his calendars.

117
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:24,415
Except... it was all backed up
on his home laptop.

118
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:27,288
Would you like to hear what he
said the meeting was about?

119
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,595
"7:00 p.m.
Talked with Philip about—"

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,640
- Missing meds.

121
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:33,773
Ooh. Did I get that right?

122
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,339
- Uh, yeah.

123
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:37,864
But "missing meds" hardly
sounds like "firing Cheryl,"

124
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,169
so maybe you want to explain—

125
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,518
- He thought Cheryl
was stealing Diazepam.

126
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:41,955
That's why he wanted
to fire her.

127
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,173
Any other questions?

128
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,348
- Uh...

129
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:47,438
Boy, you really thought you
had him with that one, huh?

130
00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:49,440
- Well, I—
- You got so excited for it.

131
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:51,312
Let me guess, you, ah,
practiced that notebook flip?

132
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,009
- Well, yes, obviously.
- I'd like to move on,

133
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:55,838
unless you have any other
big revelations in here.

134
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:58,014
Let's see. "From Gomez:
Dear Morticia,

135
00:04:58,058 --> 00:04:59,624
I feel so happy when
I'm wit' ya."

136
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:01,888
- I was just spit-balling
wedding vows there.

137
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,151
- So you said you and Robert
were partners,

138
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,544
but it was Robert's name
on the business, correct?

139
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:09,373
- Yeah. He started the practice
and then I joined after.

140
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,332
- Uh, Captain, something's
come up in the case.

141
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,203
Can I talk to you outside
for a sec?

142
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,465
What the hell are you
doing in there?

143
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:16,119
You totally undermined me.

144
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:18,774
- I know, and I apologize,
but I'm executing a strategy.

145
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,776
- Oh, really, and what
strategy might that be?

146
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,212
Make Jake feel like an idiot,

147
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,171
or make Jake feel
self-conscious about his

148
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,086
Addams Family-themed
wedding vows rap?

149
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:29,089
- No, I want Philip to
underestimate you and fear me.

150
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:31,047
I'll badger him with my
superior intellect,

151
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,223
while simultaneously
belittling you.

152
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,138
Once Philip dismisses you
as a threat,

153
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:37,445
I'll leave you alone with him,
and he'll let his guard down.

154
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,490
- If I didn't know any better,
I would say you're describing

155
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,101
smart cop/dumb cop.

156
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:42,972
- Look, I thought you had him
on the calendar reveal.

157
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:44,408
- But he was a step ahead.

158
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,323
You got flustered,
and I realized

159
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,586
in the moment we could
use this to our advantage.

160
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,371
- So what do you want me to do,
ask stupid questions?

161
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:52,416
- Stupid questions,
grammatical errors,

162
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,592
lose your train of thought,
just ask him to confess—

163
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:57,117
ooh, relate everything back
to those movies you've seen.

164
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,162
- Kinda seems like a shot at me
about "Die Hard," but okay.

165
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:01,338
- This is not a comment
on you, Peralta.

166
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:02,775
I just want to bring
this guy down.

167
00:06:02,818 --> 00:06:05,212
- Yeah, that's all I want too.

168
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:09,129
And to possibly say,
"You can't handle the tooth."

169
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,044
You know, if it
comes up naturally.

170
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,306
- It won't.
- It might.

171
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,048
- I actually think...
it can't.

172
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,789
So what do you say?

173
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,053
Me want to.

174
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,097
Dumb cop.
- I got that.

175
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,446
- Yeah.
- Well done.

176
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,448
- Mm-hmm.
- So, the night of the murder,

177
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:26,015
you met with Robert
in the surgical suite.

178
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,451
Why there?
Why not your office?

179
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:29,105
- Uh, just preparing for
the next day's surgeries.

180
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:31,107
- Don't you have an assistant
who does that?

181
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:34,067
- I'm a meticulous person.
I'm careful how I do things.

182
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,286
- So careful that you...

183
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,419
I'm sorry, I forgot what
I was gonna say.

184
00:06:38,462 --> 00:06:39,942
Come back to me.

185
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:41,509
- Now, we did a sweep
of the room

186
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:42,815
where you and Robert fought.

187
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:44,425
- Talked.
- Right, talked.

188
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:45,643
The entire room
had been scrubbed.

189
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:47,123
- It had been cleaned.

190
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,472
- It had undergone industrial
sterilization

191
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:51,475
to remove all traces
of blood and DNA.

192
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,868
- It's a surgical suite.

193
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,087
People bleed in there
every day.

194
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,653
We have to sanitize it by law.

195
00:06:55,697 --> 00:06:57,873
- Ooh, I remembered
what I was gonna ask.

196
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,049
Did you kill him?
- No.

197
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:01,659
- Ah! If you had said yes,
I woulda had you!

198
00:07:01,703 --> 00:07:04,227
After you and Robert fought—

199
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:05,315
- Talked.
- You left the office,

200
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,664
but you didn't take your car?

201
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,014
- I went to a bar,
The Scotchman.

202
00:07:08,057 --> 00:07:09,929
I didn't want to drive drunk,
so I took a cab.

203
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,060
- And you didn't
have your phone?

204
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:12,670
- I left it charging
in my office

205
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:14,498
and I didn't realize till I was
already out of the building.

206
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,892
- Oh, man, if I go ten minutes
without looking at my phone,

207
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,894
my pumpkin crop dies
on my little farm.

208
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,330
- This is not the time

209
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,550
for stories about your
digital squash, Peralta.

210
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:24,160
- Fine.
- Talking about your phone.

211
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:25,988
- Why does it matter
that I forgot it?

212
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:27,816
♪

213
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,905
Ohhh, if I had it on me,

214
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,038
you could've seen it
pinging off the cell tower.

215
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:33,430
Doesn't matter.
Didn't have it on me.

216
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:35,650
- So you took a cab
to this bar.

217
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:37,652
Well, we talked to the
employees of the Scotchman.

218
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:40,176
Nobody saw you there.
- Nobody remembers seeing me.

219
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,265
- But let me ask you this—
did you kill him?

220
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:43,919
- Nah. You know,
it's not surprising

221
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,181
nobody remembers seeing me.

222
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:47,140
The bar was extremely
crowded that night,

223
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:48,706
and I spent my whole time
in the corner

224
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,056
talking to this woman, Dana.

225
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,579
- Oh, so you said.

226
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:53,189
But when we ran all
the credit card receipts,

227
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,583
nobody named Dana bought
any drinks that night.

228
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:58,891
- Trust me, Dana wasn't
buying her own drinks.

229
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:00,718
- No.

230
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,198
- Okay.

231
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:04,026
- Hold on.

232
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,549
- I need to deal with this,
Let's take a five.

233
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:08,509
- Or... I could keep this
interview going solo.

234
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:10,815
- Of course. I'm sure
that'll be, um...

235
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,426
pretty helpful.

236
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:16,125
- All right. Where should we
start

237
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,605
- Don't you think maybe
we should just wait

238
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:18,954
till your boss comes back?

239
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,042
- Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

240
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:21,957
Because you're scared.

241
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,393
You know I'm playing hardball,

242
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,221
except for that the balls
are questions.

243
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:26,440
And here they come.

244
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:28,050
What kind of car
did Robert drive?

245
00:08:28,094 --> 00:08:29,399
Also, Dana from the bar,
what color was her hair,

246
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,618
and which night does
the cleaning crew

247
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:32,185
sterilize your office,

248
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,577
and have you ever been up
to where the body was found,

249
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,188
and when you left your phone
at the office,

250
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:36,929
was it plugged into your
computer or an outlet,

251
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:38,539
and did you kill him, and what
did your cab driver look like?

252
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:40,933
- This seems like a huge
waste of time.

253
00:08:40,976 --> 00:08:42,543
But, here you go.

254
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:44,371
Robert drove a Saab,
Dana's hair was blonde,

255
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:46,112
they sterilize on Wednesdays
and Saturdays,

256
00:08:46,155 --> 00:08:47,983
I haven't been to Vernon
in 20 years,

257
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,985
the phone was plugged
into the wall,

258
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,378
no, I didn't kill him,

259
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:52,857
and the cab driver had a beard
and an earring—

260
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:54,555
I sorry I didn't get
his license number.

261
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,253
- Wow.

262
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:58,776
Very impressive.
- Yeah.

263
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,778
- You didn't fall for my
"did you kill him" gambit.

264
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:02,171
- No.

265
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:03,520
- Although it is interesting
that you knew

266
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:05,261
the body was found in Vernon,
New York,

267
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:07,176
when that information hasn't
been released to the public.

268
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,832
♪

269
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,053
- Well, hello, Dolly.

270
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:19,754
- I can't believe you thought
I was the dumb cop.

271
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:21,147
I mean, I've watched
"Planet Earth."

272
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,800
With the British narrator.

273
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:24,628
I can tell you anything
you want to know about

274
00:09:24,672 --> 00:09:27,022
"three-toed slow-ths"

275
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,937
and I got you to say you knew
where the body was found,

276
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,417
which kinda seems like
something

277
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,592
only the murderer
would've known.

278
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:34,073
- Actually...
Robert's wife told me.

279
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:37,337
I've been talking
with her a lot, comforting her.

280
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,686
- We asked her not to share
that info,

281
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,296
and she promised us she didn't.

282
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,255
- Well, she's been distraught.
She might not remember.

283
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:44,779
- Uh-huh. Flimsy. So what
did you mean when you said

284
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:46,824
that you hadn't been
to Vernon in 20 years?

285
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:49,305
- My uncle has a cabin there.
I would visit him as a kid.

286
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:51,264
- Wow. So your uncle
owns a cabin

287
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:53,048
in the town that
the body was found.

288
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,441
That is quite a coincidence.

289
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:56,095
- I haven't been there
for 20 years.

290
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,705
You can call my uncle
if you want.

291
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:59,533
- Oh, we are. So you might
as well just confess now,

292
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:02,101
or we can take our sweet time
like...

293
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,625
the mer-jestic slow-th.

294
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:06,061
Either way, we've got you.

295
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,280
- We don't have him.
- But I just told him

296
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:09,021
we did have him.

297
00:10:09,064 --> 00:10:10,718
- Philip's uncle said he hasn't
been to the cabin in months

298
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:11,849
and he hasn't spoken to Philip
in over a year.

299
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:13,503
- Well, what about
the neighbors?

300
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:14,983
- There's only one other house
off that road

301
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:16,332
and we haven't been able
to contact the owner.

302
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:17,464
- Yeah, but Philip
doesn't know that.

303
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:18,813
He's rattled right now.

304
00:10:18,856 --> 00:10:20,423
We tell him the neighbor
saw him that night,

305
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:21,511
he'll crack for sure.

306
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,209
- No, I want me to lie

307
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:24,253
and for you to stand behind me

308
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:25,559
and say, like, three

309
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,300
oh damn's when I
really get cooking.

310
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:28,736
All right, fine,
two oh-damns.

311
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,912
One oh
- There will be no oh-damns.

312
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:32,870
- But it will be so satisfying
in your deep, powerful voice.

313
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:34,481
- We're not lying.
- It's legal.

314
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:36,004
The Supreme Court said that
we're allowed to lie

315
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:37,527
in an interrogation.

316
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:38,702
I told a perp that I knew
Steph Curry a couple days ago.

317
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:40,182
It had nothing to do
with the case,

318
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:41,662
but I could say it.
- It's a tactical mistake.

319
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,055
You're guessing what
happened that night.

320
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:44,578
But what if Philip never
went to the cabin?

321
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:46,797
- He did. I can feel it here.

322
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:48,408
- No, my gut.

323
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:50,018
- Your gut, or intestines,
is lower.

324
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:51,541
You should point down here,
closer to your pubis.

325
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,326
- I'm good.
- Suppose you're wrong.

326
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,023
Now Philip knows
we have nothing.

327
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,025
There goes our credibility
and our leverage.

328
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:59,506
No, we need a different
strategy,

329
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:01,595
- All right, fine.
How about this—

330
00:11:01,638 --> 00:11:03,379
I convince him I'm unstable.

331
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:04,772
I run in there screaming,

332
00:11:04,815 --> 00:11:06,513
I throw a chair through
the two-sided mirror,

333
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:08,254
glass goes everywhere.
He's like,

334
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:10,343
"If Mad Dog Peralta
will do that,

335
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,084
who knows what else
he's capable of?"

336
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,781
- No offense, but you don't
get angry well.

337
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,913
That's not true.
Remember how angry I got

338
00:11:15,957 --> 00:11:17,350
about how fast Daenerys got
from Dragonstone

339
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:18,351
to north of the Wall?

340
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:19,352
That was intense.

341
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:20,353
- You have a boyish face

342
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:21,397
and a big goofy grin.

343
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:22,529
It's like being yelled at

344
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:24,008
by a children's cereal mascot.

345
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:27,186
- Hey, some of those are scary.
Count Chocula much?

346
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,187
All right, fine,
I see your point.

347
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,623
What do you suggest?

348
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,059
- Let's get all up in
his personal space.

349
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:32,278
Make him feel uncomfortable.
- Okay, fine.

350
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,541
Let's get intimate.

351
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:39,067
So, Philip, you're
hanging out at the bar

352
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,677
with "Dana."

353
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:41,852
How late did you stay?

354
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,419
- I got in the cab around 3:30.

355
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:44,899
- Kinda hard to find
a cab in that neighborhood.

356
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,292
Why not a ride

357
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:47,641
- Didn't have my phone,
remember?

358
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:48,772
- No.

359
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:51,601
- I don't know, I was
watching Taxi TV.

360
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,081
- Fallon highlights.

361
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,909
- Slow-jamming the news.

362
00:11:54,952 --> 00:11:56,693
- Amy Adams.

363
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:58,869
- Famous actress.

364
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:01,611
- Why would you—
- Wow.

365
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,526
you got some old silver
fillings in there.

366
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,180
You probably want
to drill those out,

367
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,573
replace 'em with porcelain.

368
00:12:06,616 --> 00:12:08,227
- Okay, but why—
- And that is some serious

369
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,576
plaque buildup.

370
00:12:09,619 --> 00:12:10,577
- Let's get back to—
- No, no, no.

371
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,100
Open wider. Let me see.

372
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,277
Good God, when is the last time
you had a cleaning?

373
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:16,322
- Damn it!

374
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:17,540
Not only did we not break him,

375
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,151
but now I have to go
to the dentist?

376
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:20,761
- We need a new strategy.

377
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:22,589
And all this dental talk

378
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,808
has given me an idea.

379
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:26,027
- Okay.

380
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,507
We have a few more questions
for you, doctor.

381
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,857
- Doctor. Huh.

382
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,120
It's funny when people
call dentists "doctor."

383
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:33,382
- We are doctors.

384
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:34,644
We do four years
of medical school.

385
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:35,863
- Yeah, but it's called
"dental school."

386
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:37,299
- But we learn about
the entire body.

387
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:39,214
- But if you had cancer, you
wouldn't call a dentist.

388
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,998
- You know it's actually harder
to get into dental school

389
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,304
than medical school.

390
00:12:42,348 --> 00:12:43,827
- Well, because there
are fewer dental schools.

391
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:46,526
Because most people want
to become actual doctors.

392
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:48,267
- That's ridiculous. It's not
like we're college professors

393
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,529
calling ourselves "doctors."

394
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:50,530
- Not the same thing,
my friend.

395
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:52,009
- Well, sure it is.

396
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:53,663
When someone has a heart attack
on a plane,

397
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,012
do they yell out, "Yo,
does anybody here have

398
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:55,839
an Art History PhD?"

399
00:12:55,883 --> 00:12:58,364
- A PhD is a doctorate.

400
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:00,670
It's literally describing
a doctor.

401
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,150
- Maybe let's refocus.
- No!

402
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,499
The problem here is that
medical practitioners

403
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:05,719
have co-opted the word
"doctor."

404
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:06,981
- Okay, Captain—
- I know we live in a world

405
00:13:07,024 --> 00:13:09,070
where anything can
mean anything,

406
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,638
and nobody even cares
about etymolo—

407
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:15,163
Apparently
that's a trigger for me.

408
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:17,339
- Yeah, apparently.

409
00:13:17,383 --> 00:13:19,646
So... now can we lie?

410
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:21,648
- No, no.
But you know what often works?

411
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:24,390
Making him confront
his victim.

412
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,869
♪

413
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:27,610
- Look your dead friend
in the eyes

414
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:29,177
and say his name.

415
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:30,657
- Robert.

416
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,137
- Okay, maybe say
his full name.

417
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:35,139
Robert Tupper.
- His middle name's Henry.

418
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:36,315
- Robert Henry Tupper.

419
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,012
- His wife called him Rob.
Work that in.

420
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:39,448
- Rob Tupper.
- Work it into the full name.

421
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:40,710
- Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

422
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:41,929
- Now say it with a frown
on your face.

423
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:43,365
- Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

424
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:45,454
- Now try not to blink,
so tears come to your eyes.

425
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:46,673
- Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.

426
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:48,022
- Man, this guy is
a good murderer!

427
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,589
- There's got to be
some way to break him.

428
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:52,026
- Wait a minute.
I just had an idea.

429
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:53,201
Two, three, four.

430
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:01,253
Yeah, I really got to stop
trying that. It never works.

431
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:05,822
- Tell us more about
your relationship

432
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,171
with Robert Tupper.

433
00:14:07,215 --> 00:14:08,172
- We've been over this
a thousand times.

434
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,478
We got along well.

435
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:11,306
- So you never fought, at all.
About anything.

436
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,308
- I mean, we worked together.
We disagreed sometimes.

437
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,875
But we had a good
partnership.

438
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:17,051
He never, for instance,
skipped a party

439
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:19,923
so he could micromanage me
as I tried to do my job.

440
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:21,316
That's what's happening
here, right?

441
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,970
That's why you're
wearing the tuxedo?

442
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:24,450
- I skipped the opera,
not a party; it's no big deal.

443
00:14:24,493 --> 00:14:26,060
- Yeah, it's
the Bugs Bunny one.

444
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,453
- And I'm not here
to micromanage anyone.

445
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:29,455
I'm here because I enjoy
interrogating scum.

446
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:31,021
- Scum like you.
- That was implied.

447
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,022
- I just thought we had
a good rhythm going.

448
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,023
- We do.
- I know.

449
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,547
- Okay.
- Okay.

450
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,288
- You don't think the fact
that he skipped the opera

451
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:37,463
has anything to do with
him not believing in you?

452
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,334
He believes in me.

453
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,032
- Okay. Why did he
make you dumb cop?

454
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:43,338
- He didn't make me dumb cop,

455
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,861
not that it's any
of your business.

456
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:46,994
We agreed on it
as a strategy.

457
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:49,518
- Right, but why wasn't
he dumb cop?

458
00:14:49,562 --> 00:14:51,259
- Please. You never would
have bought that.

459
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:52,869
- It's just that, um,

460
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:55,916
between the two of us,
you are more believable as a—

461
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,352
- Yes, dumb.

462
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,789
Uh, the-the dumber of two
smart options.

463
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,443
- Wow. Rough.

464
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:03,010
- All right, that's enough.
You're not interrogating us.

465
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:04,577
We're interrogating you.
- Exactly.

466
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,926
Tell us about that Diazepam.

467
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:07,275
If Cheryl didn't take it,
then who did?

468
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:08,929
Because we're pretty sure
it was you.

469
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:11,018
- Honestly, it could have been
any one of our employees.

470
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,976
They all have access
to the storage room.

471
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,109
You know, it's silly, but,
uh...

472
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:17,285
I trust the people
who work for me.

473
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:18,808
- I'm telling you, Captain Holt
is only in here

474
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:19,983
because I want him here.

475
00:15:20,027 --> 00:15:21,681
So you're in charge?

476
00:15:21,724 --> 00:15:24,771
And all those strategies you've
been coming after me with,

477
00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:25,946
those were all your ideas?

478
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,904
- Right.
The guitar thing was mine.

479
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:30,907
- Well...

480
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:33,040
- Ooh, this is sad.
- Shut up.

481
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:34,781
I just feel bad for you.
- I said shut up.

482
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:37,305
- Your boss thinks you're
an idiot; that can't feel good.

483
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:38,872
- All right, listen,
you son of a bitch,

484
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,090
you think you're
smarter than us?

485
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:41,353
You think you've
gotten away with it?

486
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:43,050
You haven't.
We're gonna find something.

487
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:44,921
One skin cell, one eyelash,

488
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,749
one tiny inconsistency
in your story,

489
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:48,925
and you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in prison.

490
00:15:48,969 --> 00:15:50,884
Everyone who loves you
will leave,

491
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,102
and you will die alone!

492
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:54,148
And at that time,
it will be your head

493
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:56,368
that a bear has sex with!

494
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,417
I'm pretty sure
you're going for angry,

495
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,027
but in my mind,
it just seems like

496
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:06,595
when a Muppet gets upset
and starts going like...

497
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:09,903
I'll show you angry!

498
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,211
Do you feel like
I lost the upper hand?

499
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:15,604
Because I still think
it's about 50/50.

500
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:17,171
- I told you getting angry
wouldn't work.

501
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:18,346
- Well, your brilliant ideas

502
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,782
haven't gotten us
anywhere either.

503
00:16:19,826 --> 00:16:21,175
I'm telling you, the only thing
that's gonna work

504
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:22,437
is lying about the cabin.

505
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,221
- That would be
a huge mistake.

506
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,136
- It'll work.
- No, it will backfire

507
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,573
and jeopardize
the entire case.

508
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:29,401
- Oh, so Philip is right,
you don't trust me at all.

509
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:31,794
- Stop it! You know you're
one of my best detectives.

510
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:33,143
- So let me do this my way.

511
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:35,668
- I did. I let you do it
your way,

512
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,147
and it was a disaster.

513
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:38,453
I had to jump in with
the dumb cop gambit

514
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,846
to rescue the interrogation.

515
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:41,108
- I'm sorry.

516
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:42,414
I know you're frustrated,
Peralta.

517
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:43,415
But the fact is,
we don't have enough.

518
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,807
We may not get a confession.

519
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:46,113
It happens.

520
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,899
You're right.

521
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,466
I'm sorry.

522
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,468
This guy has just really
gotten under my skin.

523
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,339
- Mine too.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom

524
00:16:55,383 --> 00:16:56,689
and try and clear my head.

525
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:59,082
- I think that's a good idea.
- Good.

526
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,957
- Oh, no, Peralta,
what are you doing?

527
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,482
I just got off the phone
with Vernon PD.

528
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,179
Oh, no, no, no.

529
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:10,267
- Your uncle's neighbors
saw you go into the cabin

530
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:11,660
the night of the murder.

531
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:14,097
They ID'd your photo.
I've got you dead to rights.

532
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,577
- Interesting.

533
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:18,188
But, uh, my uncle only has
one neighbor,

534
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:20,190
and I'm pretty sure
he didn't identify me.

535
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,236
Because you were so careful?

536
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,065
- Because he's been
dead three years.

537
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,503
- Well.

538
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,723
I'm friends with Steph Curry.

539
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,072
So...

540
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:36,946
- So, this is how
it looks to me.

541
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,296
You were lying in an attempt
to frame my client.

542
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,776
- No, no, no, no. Look
Even if we were lying

543
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,386
about having a witness—
- Which you are.

544
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,605
The neighbor's dead.

545
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:45,128
- No, it could've
been a squatter

546
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:46,260
or a hunter
or a squatting hunter,

547
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:47,391
not all hunters have homes—

548
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:48,654
- Peralta's point is, legally,

549
00:17:48,697 --> 00:17:50,090
he can say whatever
the hell he wants

550
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,395
in an interrogation.
- True.

551
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,049
But that doesn't
play so well with juries.

552
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:55,399
You screwed up, and my
client's leaving.

553
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:58,011
- No! He can't leave
until I dismiss him.

554
00:17:58,054 --> 00:17:59,578
- You've had him
for ten hours

555
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,144
and 45 minutes.

556
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,929
15 more and we file
a harassment claim.

557
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:05,322
- Great! Then I'll just
keep him for 14 minutes.

558
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:07,673
Just to be childish?

559
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:08,891
- Yuh doy!

560
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:10,719
- I told you not to lie!

561
00:18:10,763 --> 00:18:11,981
What were you thinking?

562
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,505
- I thought it would work.

563
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:15,202
And I wanted to be
the one that got him.

564
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:17,987
Are you that desperate
for everyone to know

565
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:18,988
how great you are?

566
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,163
- It's not about everyone.

567
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:22,035
Okay? It's just...

568
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:23,819
I wanted you to know.

569
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,782
Oh, my God.

570
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,222
I got it!

571
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:36,702
- He's not answering
any questions.

572
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,225
- That's okay.
I have no questions.

573
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:39,879
That's right.
I'm about to monologue, son.

574
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:42,359
- You better make it quick.
You only got eight minutes.

575
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:43,578
- All right, then let me
paint you a picture—

576
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,362
of Philip, a successful
periodontist

577
00:18:45,406 --> 00:18:46,668
that's become addicted
to Diazepam,

578
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:48,670
a sedative I take because
I'm junkie scum.

579
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,542
Also, for real, addiction
is a disease.

580
00:18:50,585 --> 00:18:51,978
I would be super empathetic
if you hadn't murdered a man.

581
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:53,588
- I'll get there.

582
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,198
- So, one day I'm working late
when my boss Robert

583
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:56,373
surprises me.

584
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:57,766
He found out I was
stealing meds—

585
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,420
again, junkie scum—
also again, not your fault.

586
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:00,682
There's a major genetic
component to addiction.

587
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:02,379
He says he's gonna file
a police report.

588
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:03,729
I could lose my license.

589
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:05,513
We fight, and something in me
just snaps,

590
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:07,776
so I grab the first thing I can
find, and I hit him with it.

591
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,256
- You still have
no murder weapon.

592
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,388
- I do now.
Here's a pic I found on Yelp

593
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:12,999
of the surgical suite
six months ago,

594
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:15,044
and here is a shot that our
crime scene photographer

595
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,829
took of the same room two weeks
after the murder.

596
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:18,570
Notice any differences?
- We're not answering that.

597
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,528
- That's all right, I can just
tell you myself.

598
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:22,530
The Yelp shot has six of these
heavy-looking glass awards

599
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:24,576
from the Brooklyn
Periodontics Society

600
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:27,143
in the background, whereas
this shot only has five.

601
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,449
What happened to number six?

602
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:30,016
Murdered Robert with it!
- I didn't.

603
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,974
- You lost all control and you
bludgeoned him to death.

604
00:19:32,018 --> 00:19:34,586
There must have been blood
everywhere, but you got lucky.

605
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:36,588
You were in the surgical
suite; it can be sterilized.

606
00:19:36,631 --> 00:19:38,111
You never would have
gotten away with it

607
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:39,634
in your carpeted office.
- That's not what happened.

608
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,288
- Don't say anything more,
Philip.

609
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:43,246
- And your office manager would
have heard all of the screaming

610
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,683
but she was at her
grandson's play.

611
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,206
Lucky again.
- You're wrong.

612
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,468
- You put Robert's body
into a wheelchair

613
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:48,774
and shoved it in the elevator.

614
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:50,514
It's a miracle there
wasn't blood everywhere.

615
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,081
- That's not true.
- Now you're in the garage

616
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,343
with a corpse.
You panicked

617
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:54,475
and left your phone
in your office,

618
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:55,519
and you don't have
your car keys,

619
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:56,782
but Robert's are in his pocket

620
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:58,174
so you put him
in his car and you take off.

621
00:19:58,218 --> 00:19:59,262
- No.
- You can't believe

622
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:00,437
what you've done.
- No.

623
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:01,743
- Philip.
- You're flustered.

624
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:02,962
You have no GPS, so you
just start driving.

625
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:04,441
- No!
- Philip!

626
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:05,617
- Next thing you know,
you're in the Pine Barrens,

627
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,792
and it hits you:
your uncle's cabin.

628
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:07,836
He has a place there.

629
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,272
You're the luckiest
son of a bitch—

630
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:10,578
- It wasn't luck!
- Yes, it was.

631
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:11,753
You got lucky at every turn!
- No.

632
00:20:11,797 --> 00:20:13,407
I knew exactly
where I was driving,

633
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,409
I left my phone in
the office on purpose,

634
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:16,802
I was in the surgical suite
by design,

635
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:18,455
and I didn't use
some glass award

636
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,457
that any idiot would
clearly see was missing.

637
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,677
I made a rod out
of a special dental polymer,

638
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,636
killed him with it,
then melted it back down.

639
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:28,640
It's already in a patient's
mouth... son!

640
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:33,862
- Oh, damn.

641
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,081
Oh, damn.

642
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:37,039
Oh, damn!

643
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,215
- And that is three oh-damns.

644
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,130
Oh, damn!

645
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,658
Ohhh. Fresh air.

646
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:48,442
Wow, I don't say that a lot.

647
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:51,140
- There's one thing I still
don't understand.

648
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:54,274
Did you know you had
the wrong murder weapon?

649
00:20:54,317 --> 00:20:55,971
- Ah, excellent question, sir.

650
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:58,104
Yes. I spotted the missing
dental award

651
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,279
when I first took the case.

652
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,323
I asked around weeks ago.

653
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:01,498
Turns out a cleaning lady

654
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,891
knocked it over
and shattered it.

655
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:04,110
- Then why did you run in there
like that?

656
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:05,546
- Because in talking to you,

657
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:07,113
I realized what Philip's
worst fear actually was:

658
00:21:07,156 --> 00:21:09,768
that we would think he was just
some dummy that got lucky.

659
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:10,812
- Right.

660
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:12,771
He had planned
the perfect crime.

661
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,251
And it killed him when you said
he was sloppy and impulsive.

662
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:16,818
- He needed us to know
how smart he was.

663
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:19,168
- Right. Like someone else
I know.

664
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,127
- Yup.

665
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,519
Kevin.

666
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:30,092

667
00:21:30,136 --> 00:21:31,746

668
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,053

We're almost late for work.

good morning, sir.

673
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:43,366
