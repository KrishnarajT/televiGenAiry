Constantine's accounts
of the first Punic War

3
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:08,945
in the year 264—
- Ah, yes the first pubic war,

4
00:00:08,979 --> 00:00:10,814
the sexiest of all wars.

5
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:12,515
Hi, Dr. Albrin Einstibe.

6
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:15,151
I have an urgent question
for you about Ancient Greece.

7
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:17,287
Shall we walk?
- Of course, Doctor...

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,889
I feel like you said
Einstibe?

9
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:20,256
- Yes, that's correct,
it's a family name.

10
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,958
- Captain Holt sent me.

11
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:23,760
Just follow my lead.
Your theory is wrong.

12
00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:26,162
The Greeks did not climb out
of the Trojan Horse's butt.

13
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:28,098
Put this on.

14
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:30,100
People will think I'm demented.
Just put it on.

00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:32,302
- Kevin, Dr. Einstibe.
- Ah, professor McGonagall.

00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:36,139
Get in.

Let's discuss how to proceed.

28
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:29,926
- So what you're saying is,
we need to talk about Kevin.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,028
I have no regrets!

30
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:33,396
- Kevin is currently
at the safe house

31
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:35,031
with Captain Holt.
- How long will he

32
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:36,900
have to stay there?
- My friend in the

33
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,401
Organized Crime division says
they've been building a case

34
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:40,904
against Seamus Murphy
for years, and they're close.

35
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:42,906
They think they'll move on him
in the next month or two.

36
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:44,908
- So you're saying,
Kevin can wait?

37
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:46,242
- You know what,

38
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,244
you people are insane.
That was gold.

39
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:51,047
- Okay, two months in a safe
house—that's not impossible.

40
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,382
- It's nothing.
I once stayed in my apartment

41
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:54,284
for 31/2 months straight.
- Was that after

42
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:56,419
they cancelled "Bunheads"?

43
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:58,421
- I don't understand. Why can't
we just put Kevin into WITSEC?

44
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:00,256
- The Murphys have
killed three witnesses

45
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,325
in federal protection.
Captain doesn't wanna risk it.

46
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:04,060
We'll take shifts
staying with Kevin.

47
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:06,062
- No, it should just be me.

48
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:07,197
Look, it's my fault
that Murphy's after Kevin.

49
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,865
Captain Holt bailed me out,

50
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:10,300
and now it's my turn
to bail him out.

51
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,135
Plus we've got this whole
tit for tat thing going,

52
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:13,970
and it's my time to tit.
It's my tit turn.

53
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:15,471
My time to tit is today,
Terry.

54
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:17,273
- You're gonna stay
locked up in a safe house,

55
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:19,142
away from us for two months?
That's going to be brutal.

56
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,344
- You just said it was nothing.
- Brutal for me, Gina.

57
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:23,246
- Relax, I'm still
going to be able

58
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,881
to text and chat with everyone.
It's not like I'm being

59
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:27,250
totally shut off
from the outside world.

60
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:29,085
- Say good-bye
to the outside world.

61
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,453
You're in the safe house now,
so I'll need your phone.

62
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:32,889
- Internet, cellular signals.

63
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,925
They're too easy to trace.

64
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,292
What am I supposed to do
to pass the time?

65
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:38,128
- You could learn
a foreign language.

66
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:39,996
- Go to hell.

67
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,431
- The "no internet rule"
was a shock to me as well.

68
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:43,099
I was hoping
to salvage this time

69
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:44,434
to do research on my new book.

70
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:46,169
But apparently that
will not be possible.

71
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:48,138
- I'm sorry,
it's for your own safety.

72
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:50,140
Here, Peralta, let me give
you a tour of the safe house.

73
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:52,008
This is the living room.

74
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:53,376
- Oh.
- Stop!

75
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:55,178
You're entering
the zone of visibility.

76
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:56,980
Someone could see
you through the windows.

77
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,281
- Why don't we just
close the blinds?

78
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:00,250
That's far too suspicious.

79
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:02,252
Blinds will only
be closed at night.

80
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:05,121
If you must go into the living
room, crawl on your belly.

81
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:08,391
Observe.

82
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:10,393
- Seems a little extreme.

83
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:12,262
- You're right,
it's extreme of me to try

84
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:14,297
to prevent my husband from
being shot in the face.

85
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,332
I'm over-doing it.
Kevin, come in here.

86
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:18,068
Take your bullet.
- No, fine.

87
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,070
We'll stay on our bellies.
- Thank you.

88
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:22,205
This is one of several
designated areas

89
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:23,940
where you can
stand upright during the day.

90
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:26,176
You can move about freely
in this square.

91
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,112
- Wow, so we have
all this room to work in?

92
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:31,247
- Your hand can be seen
from the living room window.

93
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:32,983
You just killed Kevin.
- Raymond—

94
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:34,317
- I can't hear you, Kevin.
You're dead.

95
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,986
He bled out in your lap.

96
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,453
How will you break the news
to me? Let's see.

97
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:39,289
- We don't have to do this.
- Ah, Detective Peralta,

98
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:40,556
how are things
going with Kevin,

99
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,725
the love of my life?
Wait, why are you here

100
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:44,727
at this late hour?
And whose blood is that?

101
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,262
- Okay, I get it.

102
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:48,231
This is devastating.
I'm inconsolable.

103
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,433
And I've killed myself.

104
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:52,102
- Cool, well,
I can see this is

105
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:53,436
gonna be a fun
couple of months.

106
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,305
Okay,
we can't stream anything,

107
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:57,273
but I brought
my DVD collection.

108
00:03:57,307 --> 00:04:00,010
Do you like Nic Cage movies?
- I don't know who that is.

109
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:02,145
- Only the greatest and most
compelling actor of all time.

110
00:04:02,178 --> 00:04:03,513
Describe them.

111
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:05,481
- Okay, well, one of them is

112
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:08,351
the FBI has developed
face-swapping technology.

113
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:10,353
- Not interested.
- There's a whole plane

114
00:04:10,386 --> 00:04:11,754
full of convicts.
- Nope.

115
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:13,456
- On the back of
the original

116
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,525
Declaration of Independence,
there's a hidden treasure map!

117
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:17,327
- Stop.
- But that's the smartest one!

118
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,163
- Oh my God, I'm so glad
Captain Holt finally agreed

119
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:22,065
to let you come visit.
I missed you so much.

120
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:24,200
- Me too.

121
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:28,438
Um... is there a way we
could get a bit more privacy?

122
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:31,441
- Just pretend I'm not here.
God knows I am.

123
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:34,044
- Okay, I think you're actually
going to like this one.

124
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:35,211
Nic Cage is a chemist...

125
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,080
- Interesting, keep going.

126
00:04:37,113 --> 00:04:38,381
- Who has to
break into Alcatraz—

127
00:04:38,414 --> 00:04:40,250
- Absolutely not!

128
00:04:43,186 --> 00:04:44,454
Are there no other actors?

129
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:48,491
- It's Captain Holt.

130
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:52,095
Hello, Captain.
- And... you're both dead.

131
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:53,596
You didn't ask
for the password.

132
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,598
What if I were an assassin

133
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,401
wearing a
hyper

134
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,636
- Or perhaps you employed
"Face/Off" technology.

135
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,138
- I broke down and watched

136
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,140
one of Peralta's action films.

137
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:05,575
I'm lying,
I watched them all,

138
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,077
including one
wherein a man's head

139
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,311
turns into a flaming skull.

140
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,512
- "Ghost Rider",
and "Ghost Rider 2."

141
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:11,214
Both master-pie.

142
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:12,515
- Yes, I need
your help, Raymond.

143
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:14,384
- Luckily, I come
bearing good news.

144
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:16,386
My friend in the
Organized Crime unit

145
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,388
tells me that they're moving
against Murphy tonight.

146
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,591
You mean to say
this could be ending?

147
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,393
Peralta, it's happening.
It's finally happening.

148
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,428
- Call everyone, we'll get a
live feed of the raid

149
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:27,197
and have a viewing party.

150
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,532
"Tie a yellow ribbon
round the old oak tree,

151
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:31,301
'cause this boy's comin' home."

152
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:32,535
- "Con Air".

153
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:34,137
What have I become?

154
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,605
- Oh, yes, people.

155
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:37,473
Actual real people
that aren't Kevin.

156
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:39,509
Hi, I want to touch you.
- Babe, you're being weird.

157
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,344
- Right, sorry.
I forgot how to be human.

158
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:42,612
- Yeah.
- Oh, Charles!

159
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:44,414
- Ah.
- I need to hear your voice,

160
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,581
Tell me what I've been
missing at the nine-nine.

161
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,150
- Ooh, Terry's grandma
got really sick

162
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,618
and had to spend a month
in the hospital.

163
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:50,586
- Oh... that's sad.

164
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,156
I more meant like
funny work anecdotes.

165
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,424
- Ah, Scully sat
on a cherry pie

166
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:55,691
and he didn't notice
for six hours.

167
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,593
The tin stayed on
the whole time.

168
00:05:57,627 --> 00:05:59,429
- Now we're talking.
Did you take a picture?

169
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:00,563
- Honestly, I didn't see it.

170
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:02,165
I was at Terry's
grandma's funeral.

171
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:04,134
- Come on.
- Everyone, quiet down.

172
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,436
The feed is live and the raid
begins in T-minus 60 seconds.

173
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,138
- In one minute, Kevin and I
will finally be able

174
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:09,639
to leave this awful place.

175
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:11,541
- And yet we'll never
be free of the nightmares.

176
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,376
- No, those shall
haunt us for always.

177
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,245
- Whoa, things got
really intense in here, huh?

178
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:16,879
- Oh, yeah, it got dark.
This place is a hell-mouth.

179
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:18,481
- Cool.
- Shh! They're about to move.

180
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:20,250
- Bravo team, stand by.
- I love this.

181
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:21,584
I feel like Ellen
watching her producers

182
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:23,186
go through a haunted house.

183
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,720
- Breach, breach!
- They're in.

184
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:26,722
- There's nobody here.
- Uh-oh, the house is empty!

185
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:28,658
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Where's Seamus?

186
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:30,226
- I don't understand,
what's happening?

187
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,661
- Someone must have
tipped them off.

188
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:33,463
The raid is a bust,
and Murphy's still at large.

189
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:34,630
- So what you're saying is—

190
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:37,267
- Everyone on the ground,
immediately!

191
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,469
- Oh no, I sat in another pie.

192
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:40,670
- Damn it!
Next time, sit on a pie

193
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:42,405
when we can enjoy it,
Scully.

194
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,908
- Organized Crime

195
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:47,843
is hunting for Murphy,
but we can't just sit back

196
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,345
and hope they find him. Diaz,
where are you with your CI?

197
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,247
- They said Seamus'
girlfriend Nikki works in

198
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,316
a hair salon in Bay Ridge.
- Nice, classic mistress job.

199
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:55,218
- Hey, my girlfriend's
a hairdresser!

200
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,619
- And you cheated
on your ex-wife with her.

201
00:06:56,652 --> 00:06:57,787
- Checkmate. Well played.

202
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,389
- Okay, Nikki
won't talk to cops.

203
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:00,923
So we've got to send
someone in as a customer.

204
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:02,758
Get her to open up,
start gossiping.

205
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,926
- Send me.
I'm a gossip surgeon.

206
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,695
I can get
anything out of anyone.

207
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,663
- You can't go undercover,
you're not a cop.

208
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:10,933
'Cause I don't have a badge?

209
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,336
Being a cop is a state of mind.
- It's definitely not.

210
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:14,837
Diaz, the mission is yours.

211
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,173
- Great. I love strangers
touching my head.

212
00:07:17,207 --> 00:07:19,175
- Sorry, you don't
have a choice. Dismissed!

213
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,211
- Actually, Sarge,
I have a lead too.

214
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:22,945
I found the place that
provides shredding services

215
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:25,615
for Murphy's companies.
I subpoenaed those shreds.

216
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:26,882
We can piece them together.

217
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,951
- Smart. How many shreds
are we talking?

218
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:30,220
- A few.

219
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:31,821
- Oh, crap.

220
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,689
- According to Organized Crime,

221
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:35,725
Murphy has gone to ground,
and there are no leads.

222
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:36,959
- Oh, that's great.
If he's on the run,

223
00:07:36,992 --> 00:07:38,761
he probably won't
be worrying about Kevin.

224
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:40,830
- And if you coat yourself
in chum and swim with sharks,

225
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,698
you probably won't be eaten.

226
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:44,900
Said the half-eaten
chum-covered swimmer.

227
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,802
While Murphy is at large,
he's still a threat.

228
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:48,738
- So I'm going
to be stuck here forever,

229
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,306
following these over-the-top
security precautions?

230
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,741
- No.
- Thank God.

231
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:52,942
- The security procedures
are about to become

232
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:54,644
much more over-the-top.

233
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,746
Say good-bye to your one hour
of open window time.

234
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,715
- But sir, the stench.
It needs some way to escape.

235
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:01,351
- I already feel as though
I'm trapped inside of...

236
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:02,752
What are those things
you're always eating?

237
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:03,986
Pizza rolls?
- No. No.

238
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,321
Pizzaritos?
- No. No.

239
00:08:05,355 --> 00:08:06,756
- That's it.

240
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,324
How much longer
will I be forced to live

241
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:10,260
inside this pizza pocket?
- Look, I could tell you

242
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:11,427
that it'll just be
a few more weeks,

243
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,928
but you don't want me
to lie to you.

244
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:14,864
- Raymond, I beg of you.
Give me two hours

245
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:16,732
at the library to work
on my book—just two hours.

246
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,268
It will make
all the difference.

247
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:19,869
- Yeah, I could go with him,
keep him safe.

248
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,338
- No library. Seamus' men
could be lurking in the stacks.

249
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:24,640
- I find that unlikely.
- I understand, but I disagree.

250
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,776
- Well then,
we are in disagreement.

251
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:29,412
You'll have to excuse me.

252
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:34,917
- I'm sorry you had to witness
such a vicious fight.

253
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,321
He said
"you'll have to excuse me"

254
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:40,790
instead of "please excuse me."

255
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:43,293
Might as well have
spit in my face.

256
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:46,896
- Okay, first of all,
Rosa, you look amazing.

257
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,031
Secondly, I made an
appointment at the salon

258
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:50,766
with Nikki, for you,
under the name

259
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,902
Gabriella Fuentes
de San Miguel Estrada.

260
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:54,670
I had fun with the name.
- Clearly.

261
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,372
- Here's the plan.
Gabriella Fuentes

262
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:58,708
de San Miguel Estrada
gossips about her love life.

263
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,410
Then, Nikki opens
up about hers.

264
00:09:00,443 --> 00:09:02,412
- Yeah, this is the problem.
I suck at gossiping.

265
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,447
- Which is why
I brought along a specialist.

266
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,350
Gina will be in your ear
feeding you stories.

267
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:10,486
- I will be basing Gabriella
on my sister's friend, Dana.

268
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,323
Just be warned—
Dana real sloppy.

269
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:16,292
- So, Nikki, I always wanted
to get my hair cut here.

270
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:17,860
Everyone says you're the best.

271
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:21,864
Oh, my God,
I love your earrings.

272
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:24,734
Where did you get
those hoops?

273
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,402
- Mmm, I don't know.

274
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,804
- Oh no, Nikki's not a talker.
We're screwed.

275
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:32,975
- Don't worry angel, Gina's
got this, crackety-crack.

276
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:36,011
Rosa, repeat after me
and don't change a thing.

277
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:39,048
Can I tell you
the craziest story?

278
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,950
One time I was like
so drunk...

279
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,852
- And this meathead
comes up to me.

280
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:44,787
And his body is hot,
but his face is like okay.

281
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,556
So I'm like, what?

282
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:49,359
- And I was like, bitch,
I'm not gonna sleep with you

283
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:51,827
just because you promised
to take me to the Bahamas.

284
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,429
- Take me to the Bahamas first

285
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:55,498
and then we'll see
what happens, okay?

286
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:58,568
- I was only with him
because he drove a Jaguar.

287
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:00,035
- Turns out it was a Mercury

288
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:01,937
with a Thundercat
taped to the hood.

289
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:04,540
- And that relationship
lasted for three months.

290
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:07,410
- I don't know why we broke up.
I guess we just grew apart

291
00:10:07,443 --> 00:10:09,078
when he went
to prison for life.

292
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,447
- I hear that.

293
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:14,417
The guy I'm seeing
is into some shady stuff.

294
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:16,852
- There it is,
the breakthrough.

295
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,120
Follow up, follow up!

296
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:23,092
- That's a funny story,
for next time.

297
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,594
You're all done,
and you look hot, girl.

298
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:26,429
- No, no, she was opening up.

299
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:28,097
Rosa, figure out a way
to stay in that chair.

300
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,867
- Hey, Nikki,
I was just wondering.

301
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:34,370
How do you think
I would look...

302
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:35,871
as a blonde?

303
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,040
- Like a Danielle Steele novel.

304
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:42,144
- Good oranges, nice and dry.
Not at all ripe.

305
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:44,980
- Fascinating.
My orange is beginning to rot.

306
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,416
That happens
when you leave an orange

307
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,117
sitting around
for too long

308
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,019
and refuse to even let that
orange go to a library

309
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:52,021
for two hours so it can feel
like a real orange again.

310
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:54,123
- You know what really
causes an orange to go bad?

311
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,991
Getting shot.
Have you seen what a bullet

312
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,126
does to an orange?

313
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:59,895
- I shot a watermelon once.

314
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,897
It's exactly
what you want it to be.

315
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:03,933
I miss Amy.

316
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:05,601
I assure you, I do not.

317
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:07,437
I'm simply trying
to keep my husband alive.

318
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,504
- Well, you may not
have a husband

319
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:09,939
when all of this is over.

320
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:11,507
- You're not
going to die, Kevin.

321
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,509
- That's not what I meant.

322
00:11:15,845 --> 00:11:18,514
- I'm leaving.
This is an absurd conversation,

323
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:20,450
and you're being ridiculous.

324
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:28,924
- You know what, screw this.
We need a break.

325
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,093
I'm a cop, I can protect us.
We're going to the library.

326
00:11:31,126 --> 00:11:33,496
These two oranges
are stepping out.

327
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:36,398
Oh, damn it, peeling out.
It was right there!

328
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:40,903
- Okay, Captain Holt has
back-to-back meetings

329
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,638
at One Police Plaza today,

330
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:44,139
which means we have
a four-hour window

331
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:45,908
before he checks on any
of the security feeds.

332
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:47,777
But going out into public
is a huge risk,

333
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,712
so maybe let's go over some
self-defense techniques.

334
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:53,849
Usually, you warn somebody
before you do that.

335
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,618
- Raymond told me that
the element of surprise

336
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:57,019
was crucial.

337
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:58,988
So he's a great teacher.
But I will say this.

338
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,856
If you're going
to do a throat punch,

339
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,758
it is key that you say
something cool afterwards

340
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:05,060
like, "choke on that."
- But they're not choking.

341
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,762
They're experiencing
airway trauma.

342
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:08,030
Ooh, how about,

343
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,699
"Better get some
corticosteroids

344
00:12:09,732 --> 00:12:11,066
to treat that
laryngeal fracture."

345
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,702
- Okay, yeah,
that's very informative

346
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:14,069
and quite polite.

347
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:16,105
But maybe add
a "dirtbag" on the end?

348
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:17,673
- But a dirtbag is
a useful part of a vacuum.

349
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:19,709
I don't see how it's an insult.

350
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:21,043
- All right, you know,
puncher's choice.

351
00:12:21,076 --> 00:12:22,778
Moving on, we're going
to need disguises.

352
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:24,747
And since we're going
to a public library,

353
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,181
the best way to fit in
is as...

354
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:27,917
- Scholars.
- Weird perverts.

355
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,652
- Yes, weird perverts
is far better.

356
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:30,920
- Far better.

357

358
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:46,636

on the wifi here?

359
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:49,572
We have much content to stream.

360
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:54,810
- Bam! Solid match.
Okay, I've got three words.

361
00:12:54,844 --> 00:12:57,613
I've got an "and",
I've got an "an" and a "he".

362
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,615
Now, the "he" could be
a part of a "the"

363
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,617
or the end of "Apache."

364
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,654
I don't know why, but I'm
getting a strong "Apache" vibe.

366

Amy, where'd you go?
- Down here.

367

I let the pile take me.

368
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:13,996
I don't know
what I was thinking.

369
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,698
We've been at it for two hours

370
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:17,667
and all we've got
is three words.

371
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,935
- Really two.
Terry's just fooling himself.

372
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:21,704
"Apache's"
a long shot at best.

373
00:13:21,737 --> 00:13:23,072
- Ooh, are you guys
building a nap nest?

374
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:24,840
Mind if we burrow?
- No!

375
00:13:24,874 --> 00:13:26,776
We're piecing together
shredded documents

376
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,711
to find Seamus Murphy.

377
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:29,845
I'm really good
at jigsaw puzzles.

378
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,246
I do them all the time.

379
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,616
It's why my wrist muscles
are so defined.

380
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,651
- No offense, Scully,
but you can't be good or bad

381
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:36,886
at jigsaw puzzles.

382
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,188
It's just putting shapes
together.

383
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:42,091
There's no strategy
or reasoning, or logic—

384
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:45,761
- Look, I got half a page!

385
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:47,697
- He is the one.

386
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,699
- This is great.
There's nobody here.

387
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,634
Everyone cleared out
as soon as we got here.

388
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:53,869
Even that actual pervert
was creeped out by us.

389
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,172
I can feel your heat.

390
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,877
Ooh! No offense, but it feels
so good to breathe air

391
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:03,245
that didn't come
out of your mouth.

392
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:04,980
- None taken.
- Ooh, I know you're working,

393
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,181
but you should probably put

394
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:07,717
something on your screen
perverted

395
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,184
in case someone comes in

396
00:14:09,218 --> 00:14:11,053
like a lady in high heels
stepping on a businessman.

397
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,722
- Sorry, yes,
I meant to do that.

398
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:14,123
I've just gotten so
wrapped up in my research.

399
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:15,891
I've been reading
the most thrilling footnote.

400
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:20,162
What was that?
- I don't know.

401
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:21,997
But don't worry...

402
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:25,167
I'll creep them
right the hell out of here.

403
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,971
Hello... who's
sneaking around back here?

404
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,940
- Bang, you're dead.
And so is Kevin.

405
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:32,207
- Oh, thank God,
it's just you.

406
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,743
Wait, no, this is bad
in a different way.

407
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,779
You brought my husband
to a public place?

408
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:38,247
- He's undercover.
We're perverts, see?

409
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,982
- You're not fooling anyone.

410
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:41,984
Kevin's zipper is up,
for God's sake.

411
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,854
- Wait, I'm confused—how did
you even know we were here?

412
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:47,156
Oh, my God, you sewed a tracker
into my neck, didn't you?

413
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:49,024
- Don't be stupid.

414
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:50,926
The trackers are in your shoes,
underwear, and wallet.

415
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,261
I also braided one
into your hair.

416
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:53,996
In my tangle?

417
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,865
- You put my husband at risk,
and for what?

418
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:57,332
Because you felt
a little cooped up?

419
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,001
- That's not it.
- You could have

420
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:00,936
cost him his life.

421
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,338
I spend every day lying
on the floor of that house

422
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:05,941
talking with Jake
about popular culture.

423
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,077
Do you know what it means
to "clap back", Raymond?

424
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,245
Be-cause-I-do.

425
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,114
- Enough. We have to get back
to the safe house immediately.

426
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:14,950
Let's go. And if you're
gonna be a pervert, Kevin,

427
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:16,719
adjust yourself as you walk.

428
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:18,921
Move some quarters
around in your pocket.

429
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:20,956
- So I used to see
my boyfriend on Friday nights

430
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,792
after his wife
went to bed,

431
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:25,327
but then he left town
a couple of weeks ago.

You're all done here,

But finish

Where'd your

- Rosa, we're so close,
you can't leave.

- Tell her you want a perm.
I want a perm.

439
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:42,144
- A big ol' perm.

440
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:44,113

But the point is,

509
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:26,235
I just couldn't stand
to see you two fall apart.

510
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,037
- Perhaps I should have been
more understanding

511
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,205
of what Kevin
was going through.

512
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,541
I may die here tonight,

513
00:19:32,574 --> 00:19:35,510
and his last memory of me will
be how miserable I made him.

514
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:39,248
- So, Peralta, what do
you have to say for yourself?

515
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:40,950
- The whole NYPD
knows where you are,

516
00:19:40,983 --> 00:19:42,617
and they're coming
for you right now.

517
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:44,553
- Okay, thanks for the tip.

518
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:46,255
Let's kill them both, get out
of here before the cops come.

519
00:19:46,288 --> 00:19:47,923
- Wait, no, no, no,
I was lying about the back-up.

520
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:49,458
I came alone—
title of my sex tape.

521
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:53,062
- Doesn't matter.
You're both gonna die now.

522
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,033
♪

523
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,303
- Better get some
corticosteroids

524
00:20:01,336 --> 00:20:03,138
to treat that
laryngeal fracture.

525
00:20:03,172 --> 00:20:05,540
Sorry, I couldn't bring myself
to call him a dirtbag.

526
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:07,242
A dirtbag is a very useful part

527
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:09,644
of the vacuum cleaner.
Clearly, it's a compliment.

528
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:12,314
- Wow, you guys
are so perfect for each other.

529
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,683
Oh, my garsh!

530
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:18,187
It's all the same.
Nothing has changed.

531
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,589
Except for that.
- This perm saved your life.

532
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:22,992
- And I thank it
for its service.

533
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:25,227
Hello, Captain.
Hello, Kevin.

534
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,196
- So, here's an update
on Seamus.

535
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:29,064
Thanks to our little operation,

536
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:32,201
the FBI was able to roll up
his entire organization.

537
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:34,069
They're saying
it's going to be one of

538
00:20:34,103 --> 00:20:35,737
the most significant RICO
prosecutions they've ever done.

539
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,706
- Amazing.
- It's over now.

540
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:41,176
He can't hurt me or Kevin.
Thank you, for titting my tat.

541
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,978
- Well, thank you
for tatting my tit.

542
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,146
And you know, in a weird way,

543
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,580
I'm going to miss
our little house.

544
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:47,082
- Yes, and in an
even weirder way,

545
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:49,118
I think I might
actually miss you.

546
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:52,554
- And in an even weirder way,
I want you guys to be my dads.

547
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:54,689
- That is weirder.
- Yeah, I got stuff.

548
00:20:54,723 --> 00:20:56,091
- I brought you
your box of DVDs.

549
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,327
- Oh, thank you.

550
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,095
Oh! Forgot about this one.

551
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:02,564
We never watched
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin."

552
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,533
- What the hell
did you just say?

553
00:21:04,566 --> 00:21:07,602
- Say that to my face.

554
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:10,672
- There was a movie
about a mandolin,

555
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:12,341
and you kept it from me
for two months?

556
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:13,775
- Well, I didn't think
it was any good.

557
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,110
It's just some period piece.

558
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:16,278
- Set in Greece.
- Oh, my God.

559
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:18,280
- Based on some dumb book.
Aah!

560
00:21:18,313 --> 00:21:22,084
- Terribly sorry. It has
been a very trying time.

561
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:23,552
- Yeah, next thing, you're
going to say you'd wished

562
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:25,020
we had watched
"Leaving Las Vegas,"

563
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:26,121
a dark, ponderous
reflection on alcoholism

564
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,322
that earned Cage his Oscar.

565
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:30,159
- Aah!

566
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,061
I told you,
the guy's got range!

567
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:36,065
- Not a doctor. Shh.
