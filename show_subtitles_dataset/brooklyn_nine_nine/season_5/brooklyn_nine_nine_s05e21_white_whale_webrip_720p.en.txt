1
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:04,457
- I am so sick of this city.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,719
I go into a coffee shop,

3
00:00:05,762 --> 00:00:07,024
and as soon as everybody sees

4
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:08,461
that I'm a cop,
they stop talking

5
00:00:08,504 --> 00:00:09,853
and they avoid
eye contact with me.

6
00:00:09,897 --> 00:00:11,899
One lady even walked out.

7
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:13,640
I am just so tired
of being treated

8
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:15,163
like the enemy—

9
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:16,730
Your penis is hanging out.

10
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:18,209
- Oh.
Well, that's a relief.

11
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:28,481
♪

12
00:00:38,055 --> 00:00:41,972
- All right, there are
seven days until the wedding,

13
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:43,496
so we are officially
transitioning

14
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:47,674
from the "Month Of"
binder to...

15
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:49,240
"Week Of" binder.
- My goodness.

16
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:50,633
They're getting bigger.
- You should see

17
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:51,678
the honeymoon binder.
- Ooh.

18
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,983
Is there a tab for sex stuff?

19
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:54,550
- Several.
And they're cascading.

20
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:55,812
- Yeah, they are.
- Today's our only day off

21
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,640
before Saturday.
We have 24 hours

22
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:59,294
to accomplish a week's worth
of wedding prep.

23
00:00:59,337 --> 00:01:00,948
This is what getting married
is all about.

24
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,645
- And spending your life
with your soul mate.

25
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,081
- Uh-huh.
Hey, Rosa,

26
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,735
why do you have a picture
of Sergio Mindar up?

27
00:01:05,779 --> 00:01:07,737
- Facial recognition picked
him up at JFK yesterday.

28
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,913
He finally resurfaced
after seven years.

29
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:12,176
- The bane of my existence.

30
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,571
- Bane from "Batman."
, right?

31
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:17,007
Continue.

32
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:18,835
- He's a ruthless killer
who built a meth empire.

33
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,967
We were tracking him for weeks,

34
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,490
but he kept getting away.

35
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:22,839
- Finally, we cornered him
in a warehouse.

36
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,189
Every exist was covered
and he just vanished.

37
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,931
Then he sent us a postcard
from Paraguay a year later

38
00:01:27,975 --> 00:01:30,586
just to taunt us.
It was diabolical.

39
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,327
- Yeah, it was full
of grammar errors...

40
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,851
and other taunts
that normal people care about.

41
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,940
- That was the first time
I was the primary on a case.

42
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:38,681
The fact that I let him
get away still haunts me.

43
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,248
He's been in every dream
I've had

44
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,510
for the last seven years.

45
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:42,729
- Even the one
you told me about

46
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:43,773
where you're
flying on a marshmallow?

47
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:45,079
- Who do you think was riding

48
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:46,689
the jellybean I was chasing?
- Mindar.

49
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,777
- Well, you won't
be haunted any longer

50
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,170
because we're gonna catch him.

51
00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:51,041
Rosa, I'm working
this case with you.

52
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:52,695
Jake, I know we have a ton
of wedding stuff to do, but—

53
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,262
- No, no, no.
You absolutely have to do this.

54
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:56,830
He's your white whale.
He's your Johnny Franzia.

55
00:01:58,527 --> 00:01:59,789
Johnny Franzia?
The guy who's been

56
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,878
tormenting me with
a deck of cards for years?

57
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:04,359
"Looks like deuces are wild,
Peralta"?

58
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:05,665
Seriously?
I feel like I talk

59
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,231
about him constantly,
but it doesn't matter.

60
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:09,233
You definitely have to go.
I'll handle the wedding stuff.

61
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:11,584
It's a lot to get
done in one day.

62
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:12,802
- Absolutely.
You work the case,

63
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,151
and hey, if you guys need
any pointers

64
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:16,110
on a cool high five
or something, I could...

65
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,811
Well, if you need
any suggestions, let me know.

66
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:23,770
- This all looks fine.
- Charles, shh.

67
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:25,075
- I wasn't talking.
- Shh!

68
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,990
Olivia Crawford just
got off the elevator.

69
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:28,426
- My rival for
the commissionership?

70
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,603
She's here right now?
I've got to come up

71
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:32,605
with a confident
opening salvo.

72
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,781
Think, Raymond.
Think.

73
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,304
- Hello, Raymond.
- Olivia.

74
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:38,828
You have a little bit of...

75
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:40,134
goop in your eye.

76
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:41,788
- Oh, thank you.

77
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,224
I'm sorry to barge
in like this,

78
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:44,965
but I have a source
on the nominating committee.

79
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,531
They're making
their recommendation

80
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:48,272
to the mayor at the end
of next week,

81
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:49,970
and it seems that John Kelly

82
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,102
is going to beat out
both of us.

83
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:53,147
- Big shocker.

84
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,931
The straight white man
wins again.

85
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,367
Exactly.
- Amen.

86
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:57,673
- That was my complaint

87
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:59,109
about Owen winning
"Top Chef Junior,"

88
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,633
and you guys all acted
like I was crazy.

89
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:02,809
- Half of the committee
supports John Kelly,

90
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,333
and the other half is divided
between the two of us.

91
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:07,422
- We're splitting the vote.
So for either of us

92
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,729
to have a chance,
one of us needs to step aside.

93
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,034
- Exactly.
You should drop out.

94
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:12,079
- ... is what you said
to yourself

95
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:13,646
in the mirror this morning

96
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:14,864
instead of checking
your eye for goop.

97
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:16,779
And I agree.
You should drop out.

98
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,128
- ... is what you said
to yourself in the mirror

99
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:20,130
this morning while
polishing your head.

100
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:21,654
Don't you think it's time
New York had

101
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:23,177
its first female commissioner?

102
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,831
- What about its first openly
gay commissioner?

103
00:03:24,874 --> 00:03:26,920
- Yes, that would
be vital and important

104
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:28,661
if you weren't
1 million years old.

105
00:03:28,704 --> 00:03:32,577
- You do know that exaggeration
is the "huckster's crutch"?

106
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,536
Also, I come off
quite youthful.

107
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,320
- You just said
"huckster's crutch."

108
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:40,673
Step aside... Grandpa.

109
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:42,936
- Hey, hey, Sarge.

110
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:44,677
Large and in charge
like El DeBarge.

111
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,113
Quick "quesht":

112
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:48,332
how would you like to spend
your day off with me,

113
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:51,161
doing an endless list
of wedding tasks?

114
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:52,728
I can see from your eyes,
you're excited.

115
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:54,338
- No way.
Sharon and the girls are going

116
00:03:54,382 --> 00:03:57,080
on a playdate all day
and I'm going to see a movie

117
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:58,865
for grown-ups.
No talking animals

118
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,736
and tons of cuss words.

119
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,085
- I know cuss words.
Come with me and I'll cuss

120
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,347
at you all day long,
you big piece of crap.

121
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:04,871
- Yeah, that sounds fun,
but I'm gonna

122
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,002
stick with the movie.
- No, no, no.

123
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,351
Please don't do that.
Look...

124
00:04:07,395 --> 00:04:09,049
I promised Amy I could
get everything done,

125
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:11,268
and I definitely can't.
Breaking promises is how

126
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:12,922
marriages end,
not how they start!

127
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:16,012
- I have 143 tasks

128
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,361
to get through
in the next 12 hours.

129
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:18,972
I set a recurring alarm
so I know how fast

130
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,277
I should be moving.

131
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,149
- Not well.
I'm already three tasks behind

132
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,368
and the alarms keep piling up.
It's kind of making me feel

133
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:26,544
a little bit stressed out.
Please help me, Sarge.

134
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:27,632
Please.
Come on, you're, like,

135
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:29,025
the best husband ever.

136
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,592
You're, like, the Tiger Woods
of being a husband.

137
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:32,681
What he was to golf, not what
he was to being a husband.

138
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,031
- Terry's husband game
is flawless.

139
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,294
Okay, I'm in—but you owe me.
- Yes!

140
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:39,514
Anything you want.
Now, let's roll out,

141
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:40,907
you friggin' dick!

142
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,256
- Wait, you don't have
to cuss at me, man.

143
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,910
- No, it's too late.
It's already locked in.

144
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:45,172
- God, looking at
these old files

145
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:46,869
is really bringing back
some memories.

146
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,567
Sergio's evil voice,
his stupid face...

147
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:50,699
- His delicious aroma.

148
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:52,440
Man, I hated
how good he smelled.

149
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,746
- I know.

150
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:55,182
That jerk smelled like
an English garden.

151
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,010
- He almost made me quit
the force, but my God,

152
00:04:57,053 --> 00:04:58,533
I could breathe him in
for days.

153
00:04:58,576 --> 00:04:59,839
- Why do you think
he came back?

154
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,101
- According to
this picture from JFK,

155
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:02,493
he's taking the bus,
so I'm guessing

156
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:04,060
he's out of money in Paraguay.
- Right.

157
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,583
Didn't his number two say
he had to leave a bunch

158
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:07,237
of his cash behind
before he fled?

159
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,586
Hey, look at this.

160
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,067
Sergio's getting on the B15.
That goes to Bed-Stuy

161
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,766
via Garvey Avenue,
where he had...

162
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:15,202
a hideout in an old brownstone.

163
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:16,594
- I don't know.
You think he's dumb enough

164
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:17,900
to go back there?
- Yeah, I do.

165
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:19,075
You know why?

166
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,685
'Cause he forgot
who was on his tail.

167
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:22,035
- Nope, he remembered.

168
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:23,340
- And he used
the wrong "you're"

169
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:25,516
and the wrong "too"!
- Son of a bitch!

170
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,432
Ugh!
Damn it, he still smells great.

171
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:32,959
- How is this guy always
one step ahead of us?

172
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,787
God, I hate him!

173
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,527
- Ow! My noggin!
- Oh, no.

174
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,834
It's happening again.
This is exactly like last time.

175
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:40,705
- No, it's not.
What makes you say that?

176
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,490
- God, I hate him!

177
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:44,057
- Ow! My noggin!

178
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,799
- Okay, fine.
But not everything is the same.

179
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:47,930
- Honestly, the only thing
that's different

180
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:48,975
is Hitchcock's hair.

181
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,498
- Ow! My noggin!

182
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:56,373
Oh, I miss that toupee.
You know it was a reversible?

183
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,332
- No, you know what else
is different?

184
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,161
We're better cops now.
Look, Sergio knew

185
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:02,423
that we knew about
that hideout.

186
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,164
It was listed in his
original arrest warrant.

187
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:05,687
- Right.
We need to find a connection

188
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,558
to him that he doesn't know
that we know about.

189
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:09,082
- Wait.

190
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,431
What about his grandmother?

191
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:12,172
She was the last person
he visited

192
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:13,347
before he fled.
- I don't know.

193
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,957
I'm just not sure we'll be able

194
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,393
to get some old bag to squeal
on her grandson.

195
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:18,482
- Clearly, you've never
seen me with the elderly.

196
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,006
They love me.

197
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:22,269
I can talk about coupons
for days, son.

198
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:26,012
That's right, you're looking
at a senior queen.

199
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:28,231
That's not a widely used term.

200
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:29,711
- Jake, you gotta
pick a napkin.

201
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,365
- The binder said
they should be beige.

202
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,541
I didn't realize there'd
be 45 different shades.

203
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:36,544
"Chanterelle,"desert whimsy,"
"filbert husk"?

204
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:38,328
Words have no more
meaning, Terry.

205
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:40,113
- We're running
out of time, man.

206
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:41,549
You gotta make a call.

207
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:43,159
That's a terrible way
to start off a marriage.

208
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,682
People won't even watch
our first dance.

209
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:46,859
They're gonna be too busy
laughing at the napkins.

210
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:49,470
Okay... maybe I can
narrow it down.

211
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:52,299
Uh, I think I don't like
desert whimsy.

212
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:53,735
- Okay.
- Why did you pause like that

213
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,302
before you said "okay"?
Was that secretly

214
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:56,520
your favorite one?
- Look, you know Amy

215
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:58,131
better than anyone.
You just have to

216
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:00,133
trust your gut.
What is your gut telling you?

217
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:01,612
- That I'm a terrible
napkin chooser

218
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,049
and will therefore be
a horrible spouse.

219
00:07:03,092 --> 00:07:04,833
- That is not your gut.
That is your crazy,

220
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,400
nonsense brain.
Trust me, Jake.

221
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:08,706
You know the right napkin.
Is it this one?

222
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,621
With that crimping?
No way.

223
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:12,580
Oh, my God, what did I just do?
- You listened to your gut!

224
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:14,277
- Yes! I have a gut!
My groom gut!

225
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:16,497
- Every groom has one.
You just had to find yours.

226
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,326
- Okay, I can do this.
Uh, this one's too big.

227
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:21,676
This is too scratchy.
This one is shedding.

228
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:23,634
This one's too rustic.
Am I using that term right?

229
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,462
- Yes, you're doing it!
It is too rustic!

230
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:28,161
- This one.
Classy, but very absorbent.

231
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:30,293
Simple, and it won't clash
with our color scheme.

232
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:31,947
It's perfect!
We'll take it!

233
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:34,384
- Groom gut!
- Groom gut!

234
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:35,951
- Did you hear anything
from Olivia?

235
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:37,561
- She's not gonna step down,
and neither am I.

236
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:39,302
We're at an impasse.
- Okay.

237
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:41,217
Well, Gina and I have been
discussing the situation

238
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,306
and we think we know
what you need to do.

239
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,526
What is that?
- Whisper campaign.

240
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,354
- It's the best way
to bring down an enemy

241
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:49,095
if you don't wanna
get your hands dirty.

242
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:51,401
How do you think I stole
the cheese club presidency

243
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:53,621
away from Bruce?
Whisper.

244
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:55,579
I heard he
thought camembert

245
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:56,667
was goat cheese.

246
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,278
- And how do you think
I got Janet

247
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,149
and her horrible daughter
Dakota to drop out

248
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,717
of baby bongos class?
- Whispers.

249
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,285
- I heard Dakota has
foot and mouth disease.

250
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:07,417
- Sir, you have to give us
permission to do this.

251
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,028
Weaponize our sweet
little mouths.

252
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,160
- Ugh, how are we on
the same side of this?

253
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,293
- This is not a strategy
I'd normally entertain,

254
00:08:13,336 --> 00:08:15,469
however,
challenging Olivia publicly

255
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:18,254
is out of the question, so...
what do you have in mind?

256
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,126
both: Whispers.
- Yes, I know,

257
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:21,692
but what specifically
are the words

258
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:23,042
that you would be whispering?

259
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,565
She lied on her resume.

260
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:27,133
- She's a shoplifter.
- She planted evidence.

261
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:30,832
- She seduced a priest.
- She pads her stats.

262
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,573
- She's sort of stanky,
I heard.

263
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:34,575
- No, no.
I wanna be commissioner

264
00:08:34,618 --> 00:08:38,405
of the NYPD, but I want
to achieve it honorably.

265
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:39,493
There has to be another way.

266
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:40,929
There isn't.

267
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:43,453
Whispers.

268
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:46,500
- So Louise Mindar is
right over there, officers.

269
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,023
- Oh, please don't
call us that.

270
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,546
We're undercover.
- Yeah, we're pretending

271
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,070
we like old people
and don't think they're gross.

272
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,506
- Some of us aren't pretending.

273
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:54,769
I think the elderly
are treasures to society.

274
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:57,380
- Actually, from experience,
she is more right.

275
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:58,860
- You definitely shouldn't
be working here,

276
00:08:58,903 --> 00:09:01,689
but thank you for your help.

277
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:05,040
All right, Rosa, time for
some senior seduction.

278
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:10,350
Hello, Mrs. Mindar.
We're from Sunset for Seniors,

279
00:09:10,393 --> 00:09:11,829
and we're here
to brighten your day.

280
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:14,919
- Oh, she's sick.

281
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:16,182
Appendicitis.

282
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,574
- Oh, Frank's niece
just had that.

283
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:19,576
Hi, I'm Eunice.
- Hi, Eunice.

284
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,187
We're talking to Louise.
- Oh...

285
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,450
- So, I have a really fun
activity for today.

286
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,365
We are going to—

287
00:09:25,408 --> 00:09:26,801
I was wrong.
Frank's niece had

288
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:28,020
a botched uterus.

289
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,543
- Thank you
for that visual, Eunice.

290
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:31,501
- I thought we could do
an oral history project

291
00:09:31,545 --> 00:09:33,895
on your family.
Wouldn't that be a hoot?

292
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,288
- Oh, I guess so.

293
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,377
Well, I was born during
the Depression,

294
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,249
and I had to sleep in a dresser
drawer till I was three.

295
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:41,772
- Yeah, this is more of
a recent history.

296
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:43,600
Like, in the last week or so,
have you had any visits

297
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:45,994
from family?
- I don't have any relatives,

298
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:47,343
except for my grandson,

299
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,215
who I haven't seen
in seven years.

300
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:51,565
Thank you for reminding me
of that.

301
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,132
- Yeah, we all have
family problems.

302
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,568
The question is,
are you going to see him soon?

303
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:57,136
He never calls me.

304
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,441
- My turn.

305
00:09:58,485 --> 00:09:59,529
I was born in
the Depression too,

306
00:09:59,573 --> 00:10:01,531
but we were extremely rich.

307
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:03,577
We had a chambermaid.
- Not now, Eunice.

308
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,883
- Okay, so we are way behind.

309
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:07,798
Picking out napkins took up
a shockingly large part

310
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,583
of the day, which is funny,
because in my regular life,

311
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,541
I don't use napkins ever.
- That's gross,

312
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:14,457
but the good news is,
your groom gut is all fired up.

313
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,590
- She sure is,
and she's hungry for tasks.

314
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:20,202
- I think it's really cool.
- Oh, thanks!

315
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,595
All right, let's
crush this list.

316
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:23,162
Calla lilies?
Do you think I'm planning

317
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:26,121
a funeral?
I want dahlias.

318
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,254
No, no, no.
Brown sprinkles

319
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:29,603
at the ice cream bar?

320
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:30,865
Do you think
I'm planning a funeral?

321
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:32,345
Give me rainbow!

322
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:33,694
Mini lamb shanks?

323
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,174
Do you think
I'm planning a funeral?

324
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,307
Swap 'em out for
some tiny tuna tacos.

325
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:39,917
- Why do you keep saying
the funeral thing?

326
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:41,789
- Because my groom gut
has a catchphrase.

327
00:10:41,832 --> 00:10:43,138
Doy.

328
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:44,705
Hey, Sarge, look at this!

329
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:46,620
I cleared all my alarms.
We're amazing!

330
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:48,274
Should we start a business
where we just become

331
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:50,232
professional choosers?
We could call it...

332
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,842
"Pro-Choice Industries."

333
00:10:51,886 --> 00:10:53,453
- You're right, that name
is needlessly political,

334
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,368
but the business idea is solid.
- No,

335
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:58,110
I'm not talking about that.
All those decisions you made?

336
00:10:58,153 --> 00:10:59,589
You are way over budget.

337
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:03,637
- Oh, no.
My groom gut is a fancy bitch.

338
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,508
- Well, our only lead
turned to crap.

339
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:07,728
- Let me go back in there.
I just need a little more time

340
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:09,556
with Louise.
Did you see Eunice?

341
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,079
She was practically
humping my leg.

342
00:11:11,123 --> 00:11:13,473
- No, dude, it's over.
We lost Sergio.

343
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,475
Oh, God, I just wanna
crush something.

344
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:17,868
- Look, we will find him.
- No, we won't.

345
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,740
I thought I was a better cop
than I was seven years ago,

346
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:21,481
but I'm not.
I'm still the same loser

347
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:25,398
who lost him back then.
Stupid loser!

348
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,008
- That's very wasteful.

349
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:30,490
- Thank you for your wisdom.
Greatest generation.

350
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:32,579
Look, you didn't lose him
back then.

351
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:34,189
- Yes, I did.
I had him cornered

352
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:35,277
and I lost him.
- No.

353
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,757
I lost him.

354
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,194
I'm the one who let him
get away the first time.

355
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:40,761
- When we had him cornered

356
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:42,589
in that warehouse,
you told me to cover the back.

357
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:45,200
I thought I heard something on
the roof and I left my post.

358
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:46,941
You always wondered
how he got away?

359
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:50,336
I let him.
It was my fault.

360
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,426
And I never told you.

361
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:55,689
- Hey, Louise Mindar has
been signed out of the building

362
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:58,213
for a therapy appointment,
but she doesn't do therapy

363
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:00,128
and hasn't left
the premises in years.

364
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:02,174
- Oh, my God, she must
be going to see Sergio.

365
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:03,653
- Maybe.
- Definitely!

366
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:06,352
Rosa, we have a lead!
We finally have a lead!

367
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,049
- Whatever.
I'm not talking to you.

368
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:09,833
Let's go.

369
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:12,009
- That seems like a good thing.
Why isn't she happier?

370
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:14,577
- There's a lot going on
that I can't explain, Ezra!

371
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:16,405
But thank you.
Seriously, you saved the day.

372
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,546
- Look at us.

373
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,069
Following an old lady,

374
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:29,766
about to catch our white whale.

375
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,856
Ah, just another exciting day
for the sleuth sisters.

376
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,294
That's a name
I just came up with.

377
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,470
If you like it, stay silent.

378
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:39,515
Good, I like it too.
That's our name forever.

379
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,995
Oh, that's weird.

380
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:43,084
The nursing home's calling me.
Hello?

381
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:44,520
- Hello, this is Eunice,

382
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,348
the lady from the home
with the chambermaid.

383
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:48,176
- Yes.
- I mentioned Frank's niece's

384
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,744
botched uterus.
- We know who you are, Eunice.

385
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,963
What can I help you with?
- You said to call you

386
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,965
if I saw anything peculiar.

387
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:57,316
- There's a very strange man
in Louise's room,

388
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,969
digging around
while she's away.

389
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:01,276
Isn't that peculiar?

390
00:13:02,538 --> 00:13:04,105
I love the mu—

391
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:05,367
- I bet that's Sergio.

392
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,803
I bet he set up
this whole Louise thing

393
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:08,544
as a distraction to get us
out of the nursing home

394
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,242
because that's where
he stashed his cash

395
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:11,547
before he went to Paraguay.

396
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,375
Damn it, I wish there
was some way to know

397
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,377
if that peculiar man
was Sergio.

398
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,292
- Eunice, what did
the man smell like?

399
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:18,989
- Like an English garden.

400
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:23,385
- Okay, I have a plan
to get us back on budget.

401
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,953
I got my groom gut to agree
to a more basic wine package.

402
00:13:25,996 --> 00:13:28,912
- Basic meaning simple,
or basic meaning "basic"?

403
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,610
- Basic meaning "basic," Terry.

404
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:32,264
We're drinking the wine with
the foot on the label,

405
00:13:32,307 --> 00:13:33,830
but it's a huge savings
and we can make up the rest

406
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:35,571
if we just assemble
the gift bags ourselves.

407
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,007
- Okay, we can do that.

408
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,444
How much work can that
possibly be?

409
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,054
- Here are Amy's instructions.

410
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:42,056
"Place eight Jordan almonds—
two pink, two blue,

411
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:43,840
"two white, and two purple—
at the center

412
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:46,321
"of the organza square.
Draw the corners to a point

413
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,757
"and use
the two-centimeter ribbon

414
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:49,759
to cinch into a mini-bag."
Good lord.

415
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:52,675
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- That's step one... of 38.

416
00:13:52,719 --> 00:13:54,808
- We don't have time for that!
We need help.

417
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,418
We need to hire a team.
- I know,

418
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:57,941
but there's no money
in the budget.

419
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,856
Unless... maybe we could
find people

420
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,337
that were willing to work
for something other than money.

421
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:04,774
Hey, Hitchcock and Scully!
How would you two like

422
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:07,777
to earn some candy almonds?

423
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:09,344
- You got our attention.

424
00:14:09,388 --> 00:14:10,606
- Water bottle.
- Nut assortment.

425
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,042
- Local jam.
- Jake and Amy cookie.

426
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,827
- Cone of pretzels.
- Jordan almonds, and...

427
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,089
- Aspirin
for the morning after.

428
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,570
- Cake pops.
- And cinch and...

429
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,049
Done.
- Blink.

430
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,442
- Mmm.
- Block.

431
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,444
- Sir, Olivia Crawford
is on her way up.

432
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,011
- I know.
I invited her.

433
00:14:24,054 --> 00:14:25,534
- Did you change your mind
about the whispering?

434
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:26,796
'Cause we came up
with some dandies.

435
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,885
I heard she's a day drinker.

436
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:30,626
- I heard she doesn't like me.

437
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,193
I actually did hear that.
Officer Thomas told me.

438
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:33,934
- I told you I wouldn't
be doing that.

439
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,370
I've come up with
a different plan

440
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:37,024
and I've implemented it.
- Raymond.

441
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,026
Hello.

442
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:41,158
You have goop in your eye.
- No, I don't.

443
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:42,812
I rinsed my eyes
before you arrived.

444
00:14:42,856 --> 00:14:44,423
- Fine.
What's this about?

445
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,989
- I wanted to let you know
that I've thought it over,

446
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:48,209
and I've been acting selfishly.

447
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:50,603
I wasn't considering
what's best for this city.

448
00:14:50,646 --> 00:14:52,518
That's why,
before you got here,

449
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:54,258
I sent a letter withdrawing
my name

450
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:55,738
from the commissioners race.

451
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:57,174
both: No!
- You're young and smart

452
00:14:57,218 --> 00:14:58,611
and progressive
and a hell of a lot better

453
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,003
than John Kelly.
I've been waiting

454
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:01,657
my entire career for
a commissioner like you.

455
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,355
- Captain—
- If I have to be

456
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:04,747
the bigger person to open
the doors to change, then—

457
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,358
- I also felt bad.

458
00:15:06,401 --> 00:15:07,663
And I also sent in a letter

459
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,796
withdrawing my name
from contention.

460
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:14,235
- We just made John Kelly
commissioner.

461
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,977
- Not if we get those letters
back before anyone reads them.

462
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,719
- Are you too inexperienced

463
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:21,938
to know that power-walking
is a far more efficient

464
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:23,418
and sustainable method
of hurrying?

465
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:24,680
Burn.

466
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:29,468
Wow!

467
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,078
We're actually gonna
get these gift bags

468
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:33,385
to the venue before they close.
Thank you, Terry.

469
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:34,734
- Don't thank me.

470
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,300
Hitchcock and Scully
did more than I did.

471
00:15:36,344 --> 00:15:37,606
- Yeah, but you had to hold
your hand near their mouths

472
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,086
when you fed them
those almonds.

473
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,827
- And that's scary.
We're like snapping turtles.

474
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,437
- Exactly.
All right, let's get going.

475
00:15:42,481 --> 00:15:43,786
Those chocolates
are gonna melt.

476
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,222
Oop.
Open up.

477
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:46,876
- I gave you the keys.
- Oh, right.

478
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,878
Um... oh, no.
Where did I put them?

479
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:50,750
Let's see.
I had them in my left hand,

480
00:15:50,793 --> 00:15:52,055
and then I went
to open the trunk,

481
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:53,709
so I switched to my right hand.

482
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:55,232
Oh, but then I had to sneeze,
and I thought,

483
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:56,712
"I don't want to sneeze
on these keys."

484
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,497
Dr. Seuss.
Not really, but should be.

485
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,717
"Do not sneeze on my keys.
Do not wheeze on my keys.

486
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:05,329
Do not sneeze on your knees
on my keys, if you please."

487
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:07,157
- Jake, could you please move
along on this thought journey?

488
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,594
- Yeah, right, sorry.
Okay, so then I put them

489
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:11,466
on top of a plastic tub,
which is...

490
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,990
locked inside the car.

491
00:16:14,034 --> 00:16:16,079
The keys are locked
inside the car!

492
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:21,911
- He's gone.
Look at the vent.

493
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:23,478
We were right.
He came back for the cash.

494
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:25,915
- Hi, it's Eunice,
the lady with the chambermaid.

495
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,264
- Yes, Eunice,
we know who you are.

496
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:28,831
- That man is
in the hall right now.

497
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,442
- Ooh.

498
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:31,747
- He's heading
for the back exit!

499
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,099
Look!
There's Sergio.

500
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,840
- Damn it!
He's getting away again.

501
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:39,494
- Not this time, partner.
See you on the ground.

502
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:42,279
- You're mine, Sergio!

503
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:43,890
Ow!

504
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,718
Did he get away?

505
00:16:47,502 --> 00:16:49,722
- Yes.
Very easily.

506
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:54,596
- What the hell
were you thinking?

507
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,989
You're lucky you just
dislocated your knee.

508
00:16:56,032 --> 00:16:57,294
- How do you know
it's dislocated?

509
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:58,600
- I went to med school
for three years.

510
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,123
When?
- That's not the point!

511
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,081
Why did you jump off
the building?

512
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:02,343
- I was trying to make up

513
00:17:02,386 --> 00:17:03,518
for letting him get away
seven years ago.

514
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:04,998
I don't care about that.

515
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,521
You had an instinct.
You followed it

516
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,131
and you were wrong.
That happens to everybody.

517
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:09,524
I care that you lied to me.

518
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,091
- It's just...

519
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,267
we didn't know each other well
back then,

520
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,270
and, to be honest, when I first
got to the Nine-Nine,

521
00:17:16,313 --> 00:17:18,446
I was a little intimidated
by you.

522
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,926
- Good.
Go on.

523
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:21,580
- And then it got more and more
awkward to bring up,

524
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,277
so... I never did.

525
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,931
I just hoped that we'd catch
him eventually

526
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:28,761
and you'd never be tipped off
to the fact that I let him go.

527
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:31,590
Oh!

528
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,113
- What are you doing
with your face and your voice?

529
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:34,462
- I had an epiphany
and I got real excited.

530
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:37,073
I moved my knee
and now I hurt a-real bad.

531
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:38,205
- Okay, breathe
through the pain

532
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:39,206
and tell me what
you figured out.

533
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:40,555
- Someone tipped off Sergio

534
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,035
that the cops were visiting
his grandmother,

535
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:43,471
and there was only one person
that knew we were cops.

536
00:17:43,515 --> 00:17:45,081
That nurse who hates
old people, Ezra.

537
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,300
- Of course.
Never leave your money

538
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:47,693
unprotected.
That's the first thing

539
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,390
I learned in business school.
- You also

540
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:50,739
went to business school?
- Yeah, and I also have

541
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,349
a pilot's license.
Whatever.

542
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:53,612
Point is, now we have
a link to Sergio,

543
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,483
so let's go get him.

544
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:57,441
You're not mad at me anymore?

545
00:17:57,485 --> 00:17:58,965
- No.
You're about to be

546
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,314
real mad at me.

547
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:01,358
- 'Cause I'm gonna reset
your knee.

548
00:18:01,402 --> 00:18:02,534
Look at the bunny.

549
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:03,535
[bones crack,
Amy shouts]

550
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:04,884
- I called the locksmith.

551
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,929
He said an hour.
That means two hours minimum.

552
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:08,844
- We can't wait that long.
Our little cookie faces

553
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:09,976
are already melting.

554
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,499
We look like
a couple of Slimers.

555
00:18:11,543 --> 00:18:13,240
- Yeah, those cookies
are definitely ruined.

556
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:16,243
I'll take them off your hands.
- You're a good person, Scully.

557
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:17,549
This is crazy.

558
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:18,985
Why don't you have
a backup key, Terry?

559
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:21,378
- The dealer tried charging me
an extra $300 for it.

560
00:18:21,422 --> 00:18:22,597
I told him I didn't want it

561
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:25,034
because Terry never loses
his key.

562
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:27,297
- Yeah, but Jake does.
You always have to plan

563
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:28,908
around me.
I'm a part of your life.

564
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:30,474
All right, look.
We only have one option left.

565
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:31,519
You're gonna have
to pick up the car

566
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:32,694
and carry it to the venue.

567
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,304
- Well, how will we get
the bags out?

568
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,610
- Is that seriously
your only problem

569
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,220
with what I just said?
- Pretty much.

570
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:38,700
- This was a test.
These tasks were a way

571
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,180
for me to prove I was gonna
be a good husband,

572
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:41,790
and I failed!
- Jake,

573
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:44,663
being a good husband doesn't
mean you have to pass some test

574
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,839
or do everything right.
Do you have any idea

575
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,580
how often I mess things up?

576
00:18:48,623 --> 00:18:50,190
So you're a bad husband too?
- No.

577
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,626
Definitely not.
You're cutting in too soon

578
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,410
before the point.
- Sorry.

579
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:56,022
- Look, being a good husband
is about caring enough to try.

580
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:57,458
This whole day,
you've been doing

581
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,634
everything possible to
make sure Amy was happy.

582
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:01,549
You keep doing that,
you gonna be okay,

583
00:19:01,593 --> 00:19:03,856
even if you make some mistakes.

584
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:06,075
- You're right.

585
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,860
Thanks, Terry.

586
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,165
Hiyah!

My van!

588

What are you doing?

589
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:14,214
- Whatever it takes
to make Amy happy.

590
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:15,911
You told me to do this.
Now, let's get these gift bags

591
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,739
to the venue!

592
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,785
- Oh, my God!
Why did you do that?

593
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:22,222
- Because I care!
Oh, I feel so good.

594
00:19:22,265 --> 00:19:23,876
- Why'd you break
a second window, fool?

595
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,225
- You know, you're really

596

stepping on
my moment here, Terry.

597
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:27,575
I love Amy Santiago!

- Are we even sure
they're here?

- I messengered mine over.
There are only three

building-wide distributions
a day.

Can you describe the envelope?

611
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:57,605
- It was a white number ten.
It's the same kind you use

612
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:59,041
to send fan mail to yourself.

613
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:01,653

Well done, Olivia.

I withdrew from the race

- Yes, I used e-mail,

623
00:20:21,324 --> 00:20:23,457
because I'm not
a million years old.

624
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,285
Listen, the only reason why
I even made it this far

625
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,896
is because you stood up for me
with the selection committee.
