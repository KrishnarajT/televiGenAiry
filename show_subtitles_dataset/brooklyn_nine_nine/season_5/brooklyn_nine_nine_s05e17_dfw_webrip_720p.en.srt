1
00:00:02,362 --> 00:00:03,711
- So, do you recognize any
of these men?

2
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:04,756
- I was hiding in
the bathroom stall,

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,757
so I didn't see his face.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,454
But I heard him.

5
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:09,369
He was singing along
to the music at the bar.

6
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:11,154
- Do you remember what
he was singing?

7
00:00:11,197 --> 00:00:12,633
- I think it was that song,
"I Want It That Way."

8
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:14,766
- Backstreet Boys.
I'm familiar. Okay.

9
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:17,334
Number one, could you
please sing the opening

10
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:18,509
to "I Want It That Way"?

11
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,252
Okay.

- Yes, I can't believe it's

sex for the first time.

Oh no, I grossly
overcompensated

and now it seems
like we have problems.

37
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,856
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:46,597
- Great. Jake's sister is
flying in from Dallas,

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,902
and we're picking her up
at the airport.

40
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:49,382
- Half-sister.

41
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:50,992
Turns out that my
slutty pilot dad

42
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:53,386
made daughters is several major
airline hubs.

43
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,738
ATL and EWR didn't respond when
I reached out, but DFW is DTM.

Down to meet.
Well, we should get going.

00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,960
Her flight's gonna land soon,
but wish me luck.

46
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:04,832
I'm about to be a brother.

47
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,312
- Captain Holt, I need a—

48
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:07,748
what's going on?

49
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,576
- My doctor said I
should be more active,

50
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,405
but my squash club recently
transitioned to racquetball.

51
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,841
Since I'm not a dope-smoking
hooligan,

52
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,060
I decided to quit.

53
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:16,366
Boyle is teaching me yoga.

54
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,758
- Genevieve got me into it.

55
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:18,977
You can't believe
how many different ways

56
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,501
I can wrap my legs
around her. Six!

57
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:22,981
- Captain, if you wanted
to be healthier,

58
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:24,765
why not come to me?
I'm ripped as hell.

59
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:27,986
- Sarge, health is about
flexibility and peace of mind

60
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:30,815
and bone strength, not
building vanity muscles.

61
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:33,339
I use all of these.

62
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:34,993
Even the large
neck ones?

63
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:36,603
- They help me sleep
upright on airplanes!

64
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:38,475
- Well, there's no reason
to be defensive,

65
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:40,433
just because you don't have
the bone strength of a yogi.

66
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,783
We all have our thing.
You're a muscler,

67
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:44,785
I'm a boner.

68
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,700
- Terry can do yoga.

69
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:48,354
Terry is a yoga beast.

70
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:50,051
Watch. Give me a yoga to do.

71
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,097
- Ah, well, we're in
warrior pose now,

72
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,578
but I suppose for you we can
start in child's pose.

73
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,840
- Terry is not a child!

74
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:58,973
Terry is a warrior.

75
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:00,671
- And...

76
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:04,588
- That didn't sound good.
Are you okay, Jeffords?

77
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,459
- I'm fine.

78
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,461
Now, if you'll excuse me,

79
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:11,029
I'm going to walk out of here
normally

80
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,379
using my trademark tiny steps.

81
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:15,033
Okay?

82
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:21,474
Did the Kanye West cannibalism
story finally break?

83
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:22,823
Is that a thing?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,521
He eats tiny little
bites of people

85
00:03:24,564 --> 00:03:26,392
when he hugs them goodbye.

86
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:28,655
I tipped off Page Six, I don't
know why they're sitting on it.

87
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:29,743
- Just looking on a dating app.

88
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:31,702
Weird. Lame. Gross.

89
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,094
Dumb. Freak. Loser.

90
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:35,053
Perv. Toothy. Mouthy.

91
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:36,837
Well, what happened to Becky?

92
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:38,535
- The girl you were seeing
whose name you wouldn't tell us

93
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:40,101
so we just started
calling her Becky.

94
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:41,886
- Becky and I broke up.
She ate soup too much.

95
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:43,670
- It happened twice.

96
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:45,368
- Okay, well, listen,
you're in luck.

97
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:47,587
Because I have the perfect
girl for you,

98
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:49,067
and I'm actually texting
with her right now.

99
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,025
- No. You are terrible
at setting me up.

100
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,375
Remember that dork, Justin?

101
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:53,680
- He was a tattoo artist,

102
00:03:53,724 --> 00:03:56,030
and he rode a motorcycle.
- A Yamaha.

103
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:57,771
He might as well have picked me
up in a station wagon.

104
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,686
- You know what, men are
difficult because they're all

105
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,428
secretly monsters, but now
that I know you're bi,

106
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:04,517
that changes everything.
I know so many great women.

107
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:05,866
- I'm sorry. I just don't think

108
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,477
this is something
you're good at.

109
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,957
The only thing
I'm not good at is modesty,

110
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,916
because I'm great at it.

111
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,701
- Okay, according
to the flight board,

112
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:16,094
she should be here any minute.

113
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:18,792
I love watching a "TBD"
turn into a gate num.

114
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:21,969
Why do you look like that?
- I'm so nervous.

115
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,667
My hands are shaking and my
butt is hella sweaty.

116
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,582
- I totally understand.

117
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,758
I freaked out when I met my
pen pal from Thailand, Mongkut.

118
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,063
- But everything worked out,
right?

119
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:30,717
You and Mongkut are lifelong
friends now.

120
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,676
- No, Mongkut turned out to be
a 45-year-old prisoner.

121
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,807
It was a really awkward trip.

122
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,069
- That sounds horrible. Amy,

123
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:36,854
what if this is a Mongkut
situation?

124
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,464
- Oh no, that pen pal service
is shut down.

125
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,727
This is your sister.
It's gonna be great.

126
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,077
You just have to relax
and be yourself.

127
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:44,862
- But what if myself isn't
good enough, you know?

128
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,472
What if I'm the Mongkut?

129
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:47,908
- Jake—
- Right. You're right.

130
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:49,693
It's gonna be great.
Just got to stay positive.

131
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:51,172
We're gonna see each other from
across the room,

132
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,131
we'll lock eyes,
I'll say "noice,"

133
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:55,525
she'll say "toit,"
and then six months later,

134
00:04:55,568 --> 00:04:56,569
we'll be on "The Amazing Race"
together.

135
00:04:57,614 --> 00:04:59,790
- Ka—oh, no.

136
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,748
- It's me, Kate.
Give me a hug.

137
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,924
- Stand down, ma'am.
- Back off, dude!

138
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:05,926
That's my brother!
- Oh, no.

139
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,624
It's a Mongkut situation.

140
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:11,497
- So, this is awkward,

141
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,890
but we should probably address

142
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,892
the elephant in the room.
- Right.

143
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,981
Are we doing table apps
or solo apps?

144
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:18,548
- Uh, table apps
and lots of them.

145
00:05:18,591 --> 00:05:20,767
If it is fried,
it must be tried.

146
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:22,769
Johnny Cochran.
- I remember when he said that.

147
00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:24,292
- Jake.
- Right.

148
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:27,165
So, what I actually meant was,

149
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,949
we should probably talk about
the whole

150
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:30,951
handcuffs at the airport thing.

151
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,431
- I know.
I'm so sorry.

152
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:33,824
That was a really bad
first impression.

153
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,303
It's just, I was on the plane

154
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:36,522
and started to get
really nervous

155
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,306
about meeting you
for the first time.

156
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,438
- I was nervous
to meet you too.

157
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,092
My butt got hella sweaty.

158
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:42,876
I told Amy. You can ask her.
- Please don't.

159
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,139
- So I went to the bathroom and
started vaping to calm down.

160
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,838
Then this weird-ass lady comes
up to me, and I'm like,

161
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,883
bitch, you're trying to tell me
your kid doesn't like the smell

162
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:51,537
of cotton candy?

163
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,191
- Right, but the only thing
I don't get

164
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:54,975
is why they would handcuff you
for vaping.

165
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,324
- Because they're the worst!

166
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:57,500
- Yeah, Amy, 'cause they're
the worst.

167
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:59,458
- Also, I slapped a stewardess,

168
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:01,547
real hard.

169
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:02,809
With my fist.

170
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:04,332
- Oh.

171
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:06,596
So they were not the worst.

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,162
- Oh, my God,
are you mad at me?

173
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:11,165
Oh, no, I messed this up.
I am so sorry, Jake.

174
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,167
I really wanted this
trip to go well

175
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:14,821
and was looking forward to
finally having a brother

176
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,388
for the first time.

177
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:18,216
You know what, I'm just—
I think I'm just gonna leave.

178
00:06:19,652 --> 00:06:21,349
It's fine. I get it.

179
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:23,221
It's so crazy that we're
finally meeting each other.

180
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:24,614
So just forget about the plane.
That's ancient history.

181
00:06:24,657 --> 00:06:26,398
- Yes.

182
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:27,617
This trip was about us
getting to know each other,

183
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,444
so let's do that.
- Okay.

184
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:30,576
- What's your favorite scene
in "Die Hard"?

185
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,579
- It's okay. It's okay.

186
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:35,494
Um, when was the last time
you saw your dad?

187
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:38,192
- I mean, I've only ever
met him like nine times.

188
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:40,630
Ten if you count the time he
sent his co-pilot Steve

189
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:42,893
to hang out with me, 'cause
he was too hungover.

190
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,895
- I remember Steve.
He taught me how to shave.

191
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,244
- He taught me how to shave.

192
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:49,073
- Steve was the best.
- Freakin' Steve.

193
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:55,079
- Jeffords, what are you
still doing here?

194
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:56,559
You're clearly injured.
Go home.

195
00:06:56,602 --> 00:06:59,431
- I'm totally fine.
Here. I can prove it.

196
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:10,007
I'm fine. See?

197
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,009
- You can't have thought
that went well for you.

198
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:15,229
- It's okay, Sarge. Just admit
you can't handle yoga.

199
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:16,883
- I can handle it fine.

200
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:18,624
I'm just a little sore from my
real workouts.

201
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:21,671
With weights. Now,
I've got work to do.

202
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:24,064
Oops.

203
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:25,936
Dropped my phone.
You know what?

204
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,459
My contract is up.

205
00:07:27,502 --> 00:07:29,374
It's time for an upgrade
anyway.

206
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:35,467
Scully?

207
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,077
Where's your secret nap room?

208
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,209
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

209
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:40,603
- Help me! Please!

210
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:44,302
- Couch. Space heater.

211
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:46,347
We soundproof for
maximum privacy.

212
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:48,436
And there's sodas and candy
in the mini fridge.

213
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,265
- This room's a little small.
- We had a big nap room,

214
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,920
and you gave it to Gina to pump
breast milk in, remember?

215
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:55,182
- Sorry, Scully.

216
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,531
- You tell anyone
about this place,

217
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:59,317
I will burn your life
to the ground.

218
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,625
Oh, and there's a spray
if you fart.

219
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:04,322
- Okay, that is nothing.

220
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,367
The one parent-teacher
conference my dad went to,

221
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:09,240
he had sex with my teacher
on top of the diorama I made

222
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:10,633
of the first Thanksgiving.

223
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,635
- Oh, no, he ruined
all your hard work.

224
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,332
- Oh, not really, it was just
a bunch of Smurfs on a plate.

225
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,681
- Oh.
- He came to visit once,

226
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:18,466
and hooked up with my mom's
entire book club.

227
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,468
She can't see a copy of
"A Prayer For Owen Meany"

228
00:08:20,512 --> 00:08:21,948
without fully weeping.

229
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:22,993
I don't know what that is.

230
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,472
But enough about our dad.

231
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:25,648
What's going on in your life?
- Honestly,

232
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:26,649
it's been a tough year.

233
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:28,172
I lost my job,

234
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,391
love of my life Kurt
just broke up with me.

235
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:31,654
- Oh, hey, Amy has
seven brothers.

236
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:32,742
Maybe you could date
one of them.

237
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:34,439
- Oh, snap.
I'm down to clown.

238
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,267
Which one has the best body?

239
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,138
- Uhhh...
- Tony.

240
00:08:38,182 --> 00:08:40,010
Right? It's very clearly Tony.

241
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,272
I don't know why she hesitated.

242
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:43,317
Tony got bod.
- Tony it is.

243
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:45,319
Anyway, that's my
boring life in Dallas.

244
00:08:45,363 --> 00:08:47,974
But I'm here now, and I want
to see the real New York.

245
00:08:48,018 --> 00:08:49,236
Let's like—

246
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,629
- Walk across the
Brooklyn Bridge?

247
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:52,152
- Get tanked at the Times
Square Olive Garden.

248
00:08:52,196 --> 00:08:53,676
And get our pictures taken
with a human statue.

249
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,634
- Right.
The real New York.

250
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:58,289
- Whenever you're ready.
- Hey, let me get dinner.

251
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,507
I had like ten more drinks
than you guys.

252
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,161
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:03,729
Wow, that is so sweet,
and totally unneces...

254
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:05,383
what are you doing?
- Life hack.

255
00:09:05,426 --> 00:09:07,211
Hey, there's glass
in my food!

256
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:08,429
- Oh, my God oh my God,
oh my God oh my God—

257
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:10,127
- What kind of restaurant
is this?

258
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:12,738
He told me
to come in here.

259
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:14,653
- Nope. That was me.

260
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:16,742
I've been recording his
voice for the past two years,

261
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,744
and now I have a soundboard
where I can make him say

262
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:21,181
anything I want.
Check it out.

263
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:26,665
- Diaz. I. Need. To. See. You.
In. The. Briefing. Room. Now.

264
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,362
Watch this.

265
00:09:28,406 --> 00:09:30,234
- Milk. Milk. Lemonade.

266
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:33,193
Around. The. Corner.
Fudge. Is. Made.

267
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,586
- That is amazing.

268
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:36,022
- To find you love.

269
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,371
- Ugh.
- Come on!

270
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:39,547
Check it out:
Dannika, 34.

271
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:41,549
The only female trader—
- Pass.

272
00:09:41,593 --> 00:09:43,116
Finance people
are the worst.

273
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,814
- Okay, well, take a gander
at Jessica,

274
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:47,077
professional stuntwoman

275
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,775
just back from a surf trip
in Bali—

276
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:51,559
- Pass. People who surf
never shut up about it.

277
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:53,692
- Kinda true. You know who
doesn't surf? Gabrielle.

278
00:09:53,736 --> 00:09:56,129
- I'm out.
- Come on, Rosa.

279
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:58,218
Give me a shot.
If I mess it up, fine.

280
00:09:58,262 --> 00:09:59,742
I'll drop it, and I'll
never bring it up again.

281
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:01,831
- Fine. One date.
That's all you get.

282
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:04,659
- That's all I need.
- Hey. Diaz.

283
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:07,053
Enjoy. Having. Sexual. Fun.

284
00:10:07,097 --> 00:10:09,403
With. Linetti's.
Lesbian. Friend.

285
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:12,189
Get. Some. Get. Some.
Get. Some.

286
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:15,105
- So, your sister's a bit
of a nightmare.

287
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,237
- I wouldn't say that. I mean,
at most, she's a daymare.

288
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,065
- Those are so much scarier.
- Yeah.

289
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,371
- She put glass
in her food, Jake.

290
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:21,764
She's a con-woman.

291
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:23,113
- Look, she's a survivor.

292
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,592
She's had a really
hard life.

293
00:10:24,636 --> 00:10:26,507
And I thought it bad 'cause I
would only see my dad

294
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:28,248
for like an afternoon
once a year,

295
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,295
but compared to her, I was
a real DJ Tanner. "Full House."

296
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,601
Her dad was always around.
- Yeah, I've seen "Full House."

297
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:36,561
Look, I'm sorry she's
not what you expected.

298
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:37,867
- She is a lot.

299
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,173
But she's my sister.
And she's young,

300
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,784
and she just got out
of a really bad breakup—

301
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:43,524
- Whoo!

302
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:46,092
- She's home.

303
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:48,225
Kate! Are you okay?

304
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,617
Sounds like you're
breaking stuff.

305
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:52,229
- Hey! I'm sorry,
were we being too loud?

306
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,535
- Oh, hey. I'm William.

307
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:55,885
- I thought you just
wanted a picture.

308
00:10:55,928 --> 00:10:59,105
- Oh, we took a lot
of pictures. Get in here!

309
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,281
- Oh, no, he's my brother.
- That doesn't bother me.

310
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:02,543
- Okay, I'm going to bed.

311
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,632
- Okay.

312
00:11:04,676 --> 00:11:06,504
Time to go home.

313
00:11:08,898 --> 00:11:11,465
Oh, no. Terry can't move.

314
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,728
Terry needs help.

315
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:15,861
Hel—

316
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:22,259
- Ugh, there are silver
butt prints everywhere.

317
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:24,870
Why did he need to paint
his butt? He wears pants.

318
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:26,480
- Look, I'm sorry
about all this.

319
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:27,699
I really thought she
was gonna be like me.

320
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:29,266
But scamming restaurants

321
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:30,267
and hooking up with
street performers,

322
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,616
she is 100% my dad.

323
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,183
- Look, it's a two-day trip.

324
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,228
We just need to survive
the next 18 hours.

325
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:37,187
- Sure, sure.
- And, you know, I sat through

326
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,884
a whole place once, so I can
get through anything.

327
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,625
- I took you to that play,
and you said you loved it.

328
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:42,279
- Because I did.
- Well,

329
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:44,542
55 minutes in the shower
and that silver paint

330
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:46,849
will not come off.
- Gross.

331
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:48,807
- Anyway, my astrologer
is always telling me

332
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:50,287
everything happens
for a reason,

333
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,245
and I'm like, then
why did Kurt dump me?

334
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:53,725
But now I know why.

335
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:55,553
So I would leave Dallas
and move to New York

336
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:56,902
to be near you!

337
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:59,339
I mean, that's great,

338
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:00,863
but, you know, it's
so expensive here.

339
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:02,603
- I'll be fine.

340
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:04,301
I got a head full of dreams,
and a pocket full of glass.

341
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:06,956
I'm a New Yorker now.
Fuggedabout it!

342
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:08,871
Yes.

343
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:10,220
Forget about it.

344
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:14,398
- Babe, what are we
gonna do?

345
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,182
My sister cannot move here.

346
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,923
I'll just tell her it's a bad
idea, and she shouldn't do it.

347
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:19,446
Ugh, but I'm the only
family she has.

348
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,795
I don't want to
hurt her feelings

349
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:21,927
and send her into
a downward spiral.

350
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:23,581
- She slept with a tin man,
Jake.

351
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:24,712
I don't think the spiral goes
any further down.

352
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:25,975
- Right. Wait, I've got it.

353
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:27,063
The only reason Kate
wants to move her

354
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:28,760
is because Kurt dumped her,

355
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:30,501
but what if we can get him
to take her back?

356
00:12:30,544 --> 00:12:32,068
Then she would definitely
want to stay in Dallas!

357
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,505
- Ooh, that's smart, but what
if he's a rational person

358
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,072
and he doesn't want to be
with her anymore?

359
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:37,856
- Not a problem.
I found his Facebook page.

360
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,684
He just posted a black and
white photo of a dead flower

361
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:40,859
with the hashtags "my heart,"
"Kate forever"

362
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,600
and "love is dead."

363
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:44,558
He misses her for some reason.
- Amy, this is it.

364
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:45,951
He clearly already wants
to get back together.

365
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,692
All we have to do is convince
him to fly here.

366
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,215
- Jake, this might work.
- Yes!

367
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,956
But are we actually
gonna do this?

368
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,784
Are we really going to fly
a man to New York City

369
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:54,525
just to ensure that my new
sister doesn't move here?

370
00:12:54,568 --> 00:12:55,830
- Hey, Amy, do you have
a morning-after pill

371
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:58,181
I could bomb?
I will get you back.

372
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,661
- Use. My. Miles.

373
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:02,533
- Boyle, have you seen
Sergeant Jeffords?

374
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:05,666
- Oh, do you mean
Sore

375
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,972
- He didn't make it home
last night, Boyle.

376
00:13:07,016 --> 00:13:08,974
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
- You should be.

377
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:10,758
He could be in grave danger,

378
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,151
and you just flippantly
called him Sore-gent.

379
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:14,023
- Oh, my God. I'm the worst.
Who does that?

380
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,633
- Well, his car's still here,

381
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:16,808
so I don't think he ever
left the building.

382
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:18,157
He's probably fine.

383
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,942
Then why did you
make me feel so bad?

384
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:21,247
- To teach you a lesson about

385
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,206
about the destructive power
of wordplay.

386
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,643
Now, where could he be?

387
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:32,128
We haven't even done
the "Sex and the City" tour.

388
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,868
Oh, my gosh, I am such a

389
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:35,827
"that one who fell through
the sidewalk hole."

390
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,134
- Yeah, you totally are.
We're just so excited

391
00:13:38,177 --> 00:13:39,831
you're moving here,
we thought,

392
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:42,007
why not go straight home
and celebrate at exactly 8:00?

393
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:43,617
- Kate.

394
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,968
The Kurt?
! Oh, my God,

395
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:47,665
what are the chances?

396
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,232
- Kate, you didn't tell us
how handsome Kurt is.

397
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:50,755
I love your...

398
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:52,061
jean shorts.

399
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:54,106
- Babe, breaking up with you

400
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,239
was the biggest
mistake of my life.

401
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,545
Oh, my God,
he flew all the way

402
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,157
to New York to tell me that.
That's so romantic.

403
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,854
- It's beautiful, really.

404
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:04,160
- You're not even allowed
to leave the state.

405
00:14:05,857 --> 00:14:07,032
- You think I'm gonna let my
skank parole officer

406
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:08,251
stand in the way
of true love?

407
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:09,643
- Kurt!

408
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:12,995
- He seems like a cool guy.

409
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:14,300
- Jeffords isn't in
the evidence locker.

410
00:14:14,344 --> 00:14:16,041
- He's not in the file room,
either.

411
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:17,869
I mean, there's nowhere
left to hide. I'm worried.

412
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:21,090
- Actually, I think
I know where he is.

413
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:23,788
I could take you there, but you
need to wear blindfolds.

414
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:25,224
both: No.
- Okay.

415
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:27,183
I guess he'll just die in
Supply Closet F, then.

416
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:28,575
- He's in Supply Closet F!

417
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,055
- Great work.

418
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:32,840
- I'm sorry. I feel so stupid.

419
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,800
- Oh, it's okay.
They tricked you somehow.

420
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:38,237
I still love you, buddy.

421
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,155
- Oh, thank God, you found me!

422
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,070
- Charles was right.
I couldn't handle yoga.

423
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:46,724
- Well, we're here to help.

424
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,073
I'll get a couple officers
to help lift you up.

425
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:50,597
- No need.
I can handle this.

426
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,077
- Charles, there's no way
you can lift me.

427
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:54,210
- Yoga's given me great
bone strength, Terry.

428
00:14:54,253 --> 00:14:56,560
So get ready...

429
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:58,562
you're about to enter
the bone zone.

430
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,216
- Not a thing.
- Shhh.

00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:17,711
- Rosa, I want to introduce you
to my friend Trishelle.

437
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:19,104
- Hi.
- Sparks.

438
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:21,106
Well, I'm gonna take off.
You two have fun.

439
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,195
- Get. Some.

440
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:24,892
- I made a mobile version.

441
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:27,373
- I'll have a margarita.

442
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,071
But, like, a skinny margarita.

443
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:32,813
So, like, tequila, lime,
and a tiny splash of agave.

444
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:35,120
- Mm. I refuse to order that.
- You don't have to.

445
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:37,079
I heard her.
What do you want?

446
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:38,384
- Just take your
cheapest whisky

447
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:39,951
and pour it into your
nearest glass.

448
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:41,387
- That's a drink.
- So, with this diet

449
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:44,956
that I'm on, you can eat
anything that's clear.

450
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,089
- Mm.
- Like rice noodles,

451
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:48,394
pineapple gummi bears...

452
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:50,309
- So Kurt and I talked,

453
00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:53,791
and I'm sorry, Jake, I know
I said I'd stay in New York,

454
00:15:53,834 --> 00:15:55,749
but I can't give up
on this guy.

455
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:57,621
Especially not after he
flew out here for me.

456
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,666
- Well, sounds like the
universe just really wants you

457
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,711
to be in Dallas.

458
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:01,755
But on a personal note,

459
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,843
it is such a bummer.

460
00:16:02,887 --> 00:16:04,149
- I just missed her so much.

461
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:05,629
And so do the kids.

462
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,284
- Kurt has six.

463
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:11,417
- The state.
- Oh, fun.

464
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:13,811
We're getting to know Kurt.

465
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:16,118
- Ooh, hey, sorry, the door
was unlocked,

466
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:17,336
so I opened it.
Is Kate here?

467
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,946
- Oh, hey.

468
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,687
I think I left my wallet
in your couch bed.

469
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:21,993
Uh, have you seen it?

470
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:23,734
It's silver.

471
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:24,822
- That's William.

472
00:16:24,865 --> 00:16:26,693
He is a human statue I know.

473
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:27,999
- Yeah, it's not really a
good time right now, William.

474
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,305
We don't have your wallet. Bye.

475
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:31,829
- Did you have sex with
this silver man?

476
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:33,700
Did you cheat on me?
- We were broken up.

477
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,050
And you cheated on me like
ten times when we were dating.

478
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,661
- 'Cause you were sad
all the time.

479
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:39,663
- 'Cause my mom died.
- OH, no.

480
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:41,186
- In March.
- That's so recent.

481
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,188
- Fine. I'm sorry, Kurt.
I'm sorry.

482
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:45,103
No, don't apologize
to this guy.

483
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:47,018
He's a dick.

484
00:16:47,061 --> 00:16:48,324
- You're not good enough
for my sister.

485
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:50,195
I didn't realize
you were this tall.

486
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:52,197
Kurt. She's not going
anywhere with you.

487
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,330
Take your jean shorts
and the butt that's in them

488
00:16:54,373 --> 00:16:56,114
and get out of my apartment.

489
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,855
You're
the one who flew me out here

490
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,465
and begged me to bring her
back to Dallas.

491
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,075
- Just—
- Kate!

492
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:03,817
- Tsk.

493
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,732
- You begged him
to get rid of me?

494
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,038
- Uh...

495
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,301
- Hey!

496
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:12,130
Found my wallet.

497
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:26,275
Thanks, guys.

498
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:28,233
Have a blessed day.

499
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:34,979
- So he was a robot man.

500
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:39,462
- So you were trying
to get rid of me.

501
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,246
Yeah, kinda.

502
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,769
But I also just told off Kurt
for being a jerk to you,

503
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,467
so who's to say which thing
we should focus on?

504
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,208
Anyways, let's go to Olive
Garden and get tanked.

505
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:48,688
- No, I won't, because
that place is for family.

506
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:49,733
- Ah, that stings.

507
00:17:49,776 --> 00:17:51,561
Look, we're still family.

508
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:52,823
I just didn't think you
should be moving to New York.

509
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:54,651
The whole plan seemed
a little—

510
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:55,826
how do I put this delicately—

511
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:56,870
psychotic.

512
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:57,871
- I didn't ask you to be a part

513
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:58,872
of my life, Jake.

514
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,222
You asked me.

515
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:01,832
I was perfectly happy
in Dallas

516
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,400
with no dad and a dead mom,

517
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:06,532
being walked all over
by Kurt and his kids.

518
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:07,838
- That doesn't sound like
a great situation.

519
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,535
!

520
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:11,711
Which is why when I got
a call out of the blue

521
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:13,583
that I had a brother who
wanted to meet me,

522
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,498
I got a little excited.
I'm so sorry.

523
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,848
- I was excited too, but we
don't know each other.

524
00:18:17,891 --> 00:18:19,458
You shouldn't move here
just for me.

525
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:20,851
- Don't worry.
I'm going back to Dallas.

526
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:22,896
You won't ever have
to see me again.

527
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,942
Until, that is,
I'm on "The Voice,"

528
00:18:24,985 --> 00:18:29,947
at point, you'll see me...
♪ Everywhere!

529
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,254
- Oh.

530
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:35,518
Well, good, because that
is the last time you get it,

531
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:42,568
♪ For freeeeeeee!

532
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,877
- She's gonna do bad
on "The Voice."

533
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,622
- Worst date I've ever been on.
- Oh, no, that sucks.

534
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,624
Then why are you coming in
to work so late?

535
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,366
It's almost like you
spent the night somewhere.

536
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:59,716
I don't know, like,
maybe the bartender's?

537
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,239
How do you know that?

538
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:03,328
- Because Aubrey is my friend,

539
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:05,548
and she was the real set-up
all along.

540
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,376
- No, no, no, no, no.

541
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,552
- Yes, I knew you'd reject
whoever I put in front of you.

542
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:11,945
I mean, Trishelle
was just a decoy.

543
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:16,428
And you fell for it hook, line,
and skinny margarita.

544
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:18,387
- Nicely done.
Aubrey is great.

545
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,649
We're going to dinner
again tonight.

546
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,346
- Whoo!
- I owe you an apology.

547
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,565
You're a great matchmaker.

548
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:23,914
- Thank you.
And you know what?

549
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:26,046
I'm just glad that you
found the courage

550
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,744
to tell me how great I am.

551
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:29,049
It means so much.

552
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:31,748
- Whatever.
- Have a fun night.

553
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,576
- This is not on us.

554
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,838
I mean, it was crazy for her
to think moving to New York

555
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:35,926
was a good idea, right?

556
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:37,754
- Yes, it was unrealistic.

557
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:40,322
Just like Mongkut thinking
a ten-year-old American girl

558
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:43,629
would pay his bail and help him
seek vengeance on his brother.

559
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,370
- You know, when I'm not
distracted by this,

560
00:19:45,414 --> 00:19:46,458
I'd really love to hear
the full Mongkut story.

561
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:47,764
- It gets dark.
- Yup.

562
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,896
- Look, your sister
is a lot to take.

563
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,376
You shouldn't feel bad

564
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,856
that you don't want
her around constantly.

565
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,292
I mean, we can
have a relationship

566
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:55,989
and still live in
separate cities.

567
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:57,600
I'd love to see her, like,

568
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:59,515
once a year for an afternoon,

569
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:01,343
or...

570
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:02,822
Oh, crap.

571
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,824
Oh, something
just dawned on you.

572
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:07,087
- Yeah, I got to go
to the airport.

573
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:11,962
- This is ridiculous.
Listen, the choice is yours.

574
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:14,660
Lawsuit, or upgrade me
to business class.

575
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:16,706
Ball's in your court, pal!
- Hey!

576
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,838
Kate, officers,
what's going on here?

577
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,797
- This woman said she cut her
hand on a ticketing kiosk,

578
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,929
but somebody saw her pull out
a bag of glass.

579
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,931
- That's my healing glass,
and legally,

580
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:27,064
you can't ask about it.
What kind of airport is this?

581
00:20:27,107 --> 00:20:29,371
- Okay, I'm with the NYPD.
I got it from here.

582
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:31,373
Thanks, guys.

583
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,983
- To apologize.

584
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,985
Look, I was trying
to get rid of you.

585
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,596
Because you're a little bit
of a mess, kinda like dad.

586
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,338
- Oh, I'm definitely a mess.
- But I was being like dad too.

587
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:41,731
I was trying to have
a relationship with you,

588
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,428
completely on my own terms.

589
00:20:43,472 --> 00:20:45,082
And we both know from
personal experience,

590
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,084
that's a really crappy way
to treat a family member.

591
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,694
- It is.

592
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:51,044
Thank you for
saying that, Jake.

593
00:20:51,088 --> 00:20:53,830
And yes, I accept your
invitation to move in with you.

594
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:56,441
- Oh. Um...
- I'm joking.

595
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,661
I'm going back to Dallas.
Don't worry.

596
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:00,924
But maybe we can keep in touch.

597
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,143
- I would really like that.

598
00:21:03,187 --> 00:21:04,449
Man, I was worried you were

599
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:06,146
never gonna want
to see me again.

600
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,061
The way you
stood up for me with Kurt,

601
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:10,847
you're a great big brother.

602
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,850
And I have so many
other enemies.

603
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:15,547
You're gonna be real busy.
- Oh.

604
00:21:15,591 --> 00:21:17,723
- Anyway, I should go.
My plane's leaving.

605
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:20,509
Come here.

606
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:23,555
- Noice.
- Toit.

607
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,123
- All right, sis,
have a safe flight.

608
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:29,431
No vaping.
- ♪ No promises!

609
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:30,954
- She is bad at singing.

610
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:34,087
- Not a doctor. Shh.
