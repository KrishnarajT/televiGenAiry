00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,463
We love "Finding Bigfoot."

174
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,065
- It's our favorite show.
- Yeah.

175
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,300
- I mean, why haven't they
caught him yet, right?

176
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,235
- Totally.

177
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:24,037
I mean, he's so big.
You'd think it'd be easy.

178
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,305
- Yeah.
- Yes.

179
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:27,507
- Oh, my God, I'm feeling
a real connection here.

180
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,574
Should we hang out sometime,

181
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,010
or am I being crazy?

182
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:31,411
- You're not being crazy, Kyle.

183
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:32,578
♪

184
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,747
- How do you know my name?

185
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,382
- Because we're so connected.

186
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,318
- [laughing]
Oh!

187
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,086
Yes!
- What?

188
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,390
- So, this is my pad.

189
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,525
TV room,
recording studio

190
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,060
where I lay down my raps.

191
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:49,662
And this is where
the magic happens.

192
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,131
It's where I practice
doing magic.

193
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:52,632
- Oh, so literally, then.

194
00:05:52,665 --> 00:05:54,467
Love all the lamps.
- Thanks.

195
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,402
I accidentally ordered
100 lamps instead of one.

196
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,738
They only give you, like,
a six-month return window, so.

197
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:00,340
You get it.
- Totally.

198
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:01,341
Man, this place is huge.

199
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:02,608
How do you afford it?

200
00:06:02,642 --> 00:06:05,045
Do you have, like, a great job
or family money?

201
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:07,347
- Yeah, lots of it, I'm part
of the Murphy crime family.

202
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,681
both: Oh.
- Aw, damn it.

203
00:06:08,714 --> 00:06:10,783
I am not supposed to say that.

204
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,685
We're not a crime family, okay?

205
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:15,688
We're a cream family.
- Dude, it's fine.

206
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:18,791
Honestly, we're also
involved in... cream.

207
00:06:18,824 --> 00:06:21,027
- Organized cream.
- Cool, cool.

208
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,529
- Hey, just checking—
you guys mean crime, right?

209
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,365
- Yes.
- Okay, good, right, go on.

210
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:27,467
- Well, we're actually looking
for some work right now.

211
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,135
We just got into town
from Miami.

212
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,037
- Where we didn't sleep
with the same prostitute.

213
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,706
- Yes, anyways, do you think
your family needs any help?

214
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,675
Any big jobs coming up?
- Uh, wouldn't know.

215
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,110
They don't tell me anything.
They're mad at me.

216
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:37,977
- What?
Why?

217
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,712
- I used to drive
for my uncle Seamus.

218
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:41,147
One day, he had this big
cream meeting—

219
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,715
- We don't have to keep
doing that.

220
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,384
- Okay, cool.
He was torturing some guy.

221
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,452
Anyway, I was waiting
in his favorite car,

222
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:47,720
a white 1980 Rolls-Royce,

223
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,455
but he was taking forever,

224
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:52,058
so I decided to go catch
a matinee of "Suicide Squad."

225
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:53,659
- And he was pissed
that you drove off in the car?

226
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,395
- No, obviously I left
the Rolls there

227
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:56,662
with the keys in the ignition
in case he needed it,

228
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:58,064
but guess what happened?

229
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:00,200
both: It got stolen.
- Oh, my God.

230
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,735
How'd you guys know?
- We're just connected, Kyle.

231
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:05,405
- [chuckles] Team Bigfoot.
both: Team Bigfoot!

232
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,840
- Anyway, they kicked me out of
the family business for good.

233
00:07:07,873 --> 00:07:12,078
Apparently, I'm a "liability"
and "worthless" and "Kyle."

234
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,747
The last one is just my name,
but you should hear their tone.

235
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,483
- So, you don't know
about anything

236
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:18,651
that's going down at all?

237
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:20,186
- No, but if you know anyone

238
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,155
who's looking to buy a lamp
for really cheap,

239
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:22,922
I know a guy.

240
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:24,757
- Oh, Kyle.
- Yeah, that's it.

241
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,192
That's how they say it.

242
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,560
- [sighs]

243
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:28,828
This is taking forever.

244
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:30,763
Can't you just forge
the signatures?

245
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:33,099
- I'm a notary, Rosa.

246
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,634
You can't say stuff like that
around me.

247
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,136
I could lose my stamp
over that.

248
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:37,770
- I've never met anyone
who cares so much

249
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:39,439
about stupid bureaucracy.

250
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:40,873
- Bureaucracy is not stupid.

251
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,208
It's elegant.

252
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:44,577
It's a beautiful puzzle

253
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,878
waiting to be cracked.

254
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:49,549
Every rule, every form
has its purpose.

255
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,517
It all fits together,

256
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,119
and when the puzzle is solved

257
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,455
and you take a step back
and see the big picture,

258
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:58,558
it's like staring into
the face of God.

259
00:07:58,591 --> 00:07:59,692
- Hey.

260
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:01,827
We moved up a spot.
- Oh.

261
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,464
- You seem like a real nerd.

262
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,533
- Hello, Muriel.

263
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,868
Another day in paradise?

264
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,770
- She actually means that.
Please don't be offended.

265
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:11,904
- Great.
What do you want?

266
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:13,673
- To apply
for a block party permit.

267
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,475
Here is form 1290.

268
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,777
- Oh, wait, you trying to get
a permit for this Friday?

269
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,811
You would need—

270
00:08:18,844 --> 00:08:20,580
- 1290-B expedited request

271
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:23,683
and a 1021-J adjustment waiver

272
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:26,819
and a sweet, sweet
P-28-P supplemental.

273
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:28,854
- Right.
There's just one problem.

274
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:31,857
- What? No.
I did absolutely everything.

275
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,826
- The 1021-J
has to be submitted

276
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,561
with an approved 1290.

277
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:40,533
- But I'm submitting the 1021-J
to get the 1290 approved.

278
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:42,835
That doesn't make any sense.
- I guess it doesn't.

279
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:45,705
- Okay.
Okay, okay.

280
00:08:45,738 --> 00:08:48,608
This is just a puzzle,
and I can figure it out.

281
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,710
To get an approved 1290,

282
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,845
I need an approved 1021-J,

283
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:55,181
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

284
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,217
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J,

285
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,219
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

286
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:01,221
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J,

287
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,822
which I can't get without
an approved 1290,

288
00:09:02,855 --> 00:09:04,724
which I can't get
without an approved 1021-J—

289
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,292
- Okay.
She's in a loop.

290
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:07,960
You broke her brain.
I'm gonna take her out of here.

291
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:09,529
- Which I can't get
without an approved 1290,

292
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:10,896
which I can't get without...

293
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,866
- Sarge, Hitchcock and I
just uncovered something huge.

294
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:15,301
- You solved a crime?
- What?

295
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,237
That's insane, no.
It's about our nap room.

296
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,771
- Guess how long
Gina's been pumping for?

297
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,606
- I don't want to—
- The last hour.

298
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,741
- Now, everyone knows
Gina's using

299
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:23,243
a Nodella Harmony Breastpump

300
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:24,644
with 2-Phase
Expression Technology

301
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:26,279
for faster milk expression.

302
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:27,980
- You shouldn't know so much
about breastpumps, Hitchcock.

303
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:29,315
- Well,
you should know more about

304
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,883
what's going on
in your precinct.

305
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,852
- Given the Nodella's
exceptional flow,

306
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:34,620
there's no way she needs
to be pumping

307
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:35,988
more than 20 minutes
a side.

308
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:37,957
- Wow, you didn't even
say "breast."

309
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,759
- Yeah,
because I'm not a child.

310
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,294
I need my afternoon nap.

311
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,563
- Okay, what are you guys
trying to say?

312
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:44,897
- Come with us.

313
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,766
- Where's Gina?

314
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,801
- She just left the pump
running and disappeared.

315
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:52,272
You got played so hard.
- You cuck.

316
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:54,874
- So, did you make contact
with Murphy's weak link?

317
00:09:54,907 --> 00:09:56,342
Diane Keaton's brother-in-law?
- Yes.

318
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,010
We're real tight,
but unfortunately,

319
00:09:58,043 --> 00:09:59,945
he's such a weak link, his
family won't tell him anything.

320
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,614
- So... that's it, then.

321
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:03,249
We have no idea what
Murphy's really up to?

322
00:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,885
I can't morally give him
that permit, so it's over.

323
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:07,587
- Wait.
We still have time.

324
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,755
Maybe there's a way to get Kyle
back in with his family.

325
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,257
Like, what if...

326
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,825
- Ooh,
Jake's wheels are turning.

327
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,026
Your brain baby is crowning.

328
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:15,795
- Boyle, please.
That's disgusting.

329
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,797
- No, it's helping.
I am having a brain baby.

330
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,799
- Then push, man, push.
- Breathe.

331
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:21,000
- You can do this.

332
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,002
You are so strong.
- Ah, got it!

333
00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:25,037
Kyle's uncle cut him off
because of that stolen car,

334
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,772
right, but what if
we could find that car

335
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,341
and have Kyle
give it back to him?

336
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:29,875
- Then all is forgiven.
Kyle's back in the family.

337
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,611
- Right, but how
do we find that car?

338
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,045
- We just did a big sweep
of Brooklyn chop shops.

339
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:34,814
Maybe Seamus's car
is one of them.

340
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,282

00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,883
- Ugh. I know.
I'm sorry, I went home.

512
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,719
I was missing Iggy
and I wanted to see her.

513
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:16,088
- Oh, well,
you could've just told me.

514
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:17,823
- Yeah, but I was embarrassed.

515
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:20,325
I thought I'd be as incredible
at being a working mom

516
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,861
as I am at everything else
I do:

517
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:25,364
dancing, public speaking,
capoeira, ghost hunting...

518
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:27,066
- You don't have to keep
listing things you're good at.

519
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:29,702
- Earring-making,
cabinet renovation.

520
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,904
But juggling things is hard.

521
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,674
I feel like a failure.
I feel like a Coulier.

522
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,375
- No, you're not a Coulier,
Gina.

523
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:38,978
Look,
being a working parent is hard.

524
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,746
When my twins were born,
I made Sharon

525
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,382
keep the phone on all day
just so I could listen to them.

526
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:47,086
One month,
I used 25,000 minutes.

527
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,821
I'm sorry.

528
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,023
I just realized I told you it
sucks and there's no solution.

529
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:52,692
- That's okay.

530
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:53,859
It's kind of nice
to hear this kind of thing

531
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:57,663
from another parent,
so... thank you.

532
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,899
You know, I don't even think
Dave Coulier juggles.

533
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:01,767
- I Googled it.
He doesn't.

534
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,804

That sounds like
professional music to you?

542

- All music after Mahler
sounds exactly like that.

Now, how do we expect Kyle
to transfer the bug to Seamus?

544

bottle of whiskey

to give to his uncle as a gift.

Oops.

- What was that?
- He broke the bottle.

552
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,171
He Fredo'd it.

553
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:40,773
- Oh, so you didn't plan
for everything?

554
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,441
You forgot to
idiot-proof the bottle.

555
00:17:42,474 --> 00:17:44,476
- Well, perhaps you want
to idiot-proof your criticism,

556
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:46,879
because I got him a backup
bottle with a backup bug.

557
00:17:46,912 --> 00:17:48,781
- It's a good thing
I had another one.

562
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,488
I also put a bug in the keys.

563
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,057

568
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:07,099
These are for you.

Hey, welcome back
to the family, huh?

We got a lot
of catching up to do.

572

Well done.
Thank you both.

We reunited a family.

You wish.

here's what we found out

00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:27,486
from the bug that we placed.

579
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,054
Seamus is planning on

580
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,355
stealing $20 million
in bearer bonds

581
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:32,191
from an armored truck.
As we speak,

582
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,026
the block party
is in full swing.

583
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:35,327
- Oh, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Here you go.

584
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,196
- Turns out,
he only wanted a permit

585
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:38,964
so the street would be
closed down,

586
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:40,065
forcing the armored truck
to divert

587
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,366
down a narrow abandoned alley.

588
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,168
- It's the perfect place
for an ambush,

589
00:18:43,202 --> 00:18:44,236
but we changed
the truck's schedule,

590
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,071
so they hadn't picked up
the bonds yet.

591
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:47,406
- Hey,
there's nothing in here.

592
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:49,041
- That truck is as empty

593
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:52,111
as Jackson Browne's
running surface.

594
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:54,046
Empty?
"Running on Empty"?

like it—Charles?

597
00:18:57,182 --> 00:18:58,818
- Don't make me do this, Jake.
- Whatever.

598
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,252
The point is,
the truck is empty.

599
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,087
- So we did it—I can't believe
it's all wrapped up.

600
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,188
- Do you even know what we did?
- No.

601
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:05,290
Just feeling out how close
we were to calling it a day.

602
00:19:05,324 --> 00:19:07,059
- Soon, Scully.
Now that Captain Holt

603
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,327
has repaid his debt
without compromising

604
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,095
his stupid moral compass,
the only thing left

605
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:11,363
is for him
to get his tape back,

606
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:13,365
which should be happening
right about... now.

607
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:14,499
- Oh.

608
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,135
- Your block party's
going well.

609
00:19:16,168 --> 00:19:17,536

as I hoped it would be,

610
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:20,806
but, um, you lived up
to your end of the bargain, so.

611
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,808

- As am I.

00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:31,283
Good day.

What's wrong?

620
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:38,523
- Why do you always assume
something's wrong

621
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:39,859
when I come in here?

622
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:40,860
Couldn't I be bringing you
good news?

623
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:42,027
- Are you?
- No.

624
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,395
Something's terribly wrong.

625
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:45,130
It's Seamus.
- What do you mean?

626
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:46,866
Forensics confirmed
the tape he made of me

627
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:47,867
was never copied.
We're in the clear.

628
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,234
- It's not about that.

629
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,402
I was checking our bug,
and I overheard him

630
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:53,238
talking about what went wrong
with the armored car heist.

631
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:54,539
He's pinning the blame on—

632
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:57,176
- Kyle.
It has to be him.

633
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,044
Everything was going great
until he suddenly reappeared

635
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,147
I bet that dum-dum
ran his mouth,

636
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:05,484
and that is the last time
he screws over this family.

637
00:20:05,517 --> 00:20:06,886
He's gonna pay.

638
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:08,420
- Did he say
what he would do to him?

639
00:20:08,453 --> 00:20:10,555
- No, they ran over a huge
pothole and then complained

640
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:12,357
about de Blasio
for the next hour.

641
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:13,558

they're gonna
do something bad to Kyle.

00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:18,530
They might just lightly beat
him up, so we could do nothing.

We could take the loophole.
