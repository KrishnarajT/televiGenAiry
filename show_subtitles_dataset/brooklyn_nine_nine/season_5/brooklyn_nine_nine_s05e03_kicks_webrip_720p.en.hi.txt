176
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,721
Cold.

177
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,855
I'm so confused.

178
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:22,923
both: They shared the flan!

179
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,658
- Okay, but...

180
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,892
That seems like
a bit of a stretch.

181
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,728
- Nope.
When it comes to cheating,

182
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,763
you gotta pay attention
to all the signs.

183
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,097
During my year abroad in Japan,

184
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,699
I learned that the hard way.

185
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:33,800
[in Japanese]
Chiaki...

186
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,379
There was no Japanese tea sock.

187
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,981
But there was a Japanese man.

188
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,816
I wasted a year on Chiaki.

189
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,151
- So, what should I do?

190
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,352
- Maybe don't jump
to conclusions.

191
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,787
- No! Interrogate him!

192
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,756
Follow the flan, Rosa.

193
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,990
Follow the flan.

194
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,091
- Right.

195
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,826
Follow the flan.

196
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,995
- Guess what
I'm holding behind my back?

197
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,830
- Before we begin,

198
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,699
what are the parameters
of the guessing game?

199
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,933
How many guesses do I get?
Is there a time limit?

200
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,669
- Forget it.
You ruin everything.

201
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,770
It's the police code
and ethics manual.

202
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,104
Chapter four. Page 83.

203
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,405
- You should not have told me.

204
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,840
I never would've guessed it.

205
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,175
Now I've won.

206
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,010
- This.
This is what I've missed.

207
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,379
- It clearly states that
I can get off of desk duty if

208
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,381
I pass a field evaluation
performed by a member

209
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,717
of the Municipal Police
Training Council.

210
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,752
That's right.
It's a loophole.

211
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,887
Loophole high five.

212
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,221
- [gasps] Loop—
- Hole.

213
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,857
- Loop—
- Hole!

214
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,225
- Enough. This is
highly inappropriate.

215
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,127
Did you also see
where it states,

216
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,130
"If you fail the evaluation,
you will be suspended"?

217
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,732
I would have to take
your gun and badge.

218
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,233
- I'm not worried about that.

219
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,968
I swear to my personal Lord
and Savior, Steph Curry,

220
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,436
I'm ready.

221
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,438
- I think you're rushing.
It's a bad idea.

222
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,841
- Doesn't matter. I'm allowed
to demand my own evaluation.

223
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,242
- Yes, but as your
commanding officer,

224
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,679
I choose the evaluator.
And I choose...

225
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:53,680
Me.

226
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:54,981
- Wait. What?

227
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,883
- I'm a qualified member
of the MPTC.

228
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:57,884
I'll administer it.

229
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,686
- All right. Fine.

230
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,987
I'll pass your dumb evaluation

231
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,789
and crack this case.
Bring it on.

232
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,157
- I will.
- Good.

233
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,192
- Good.
- You're good. But I'm better.

234
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:07,894
And I'm gonna ace this thing
before you can even—

235
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,029
Oh, wait, wait,
what are you writing down?

236
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,463
Sir? What are you writing down?

237
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,165
Charles...
[whispers] What's he writing?

238
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,167
- Write something good.
- Write something good.

239
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,737
We're just gonna leave.
Just stop writing.

240
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,938
Just stop writing.
- Stop writing.

241
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,172
- Unless it's good.
- No.

242
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,206
- Is it good?
- Is it good?

243
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,441
We're gonna go. Sir?

244
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,475
- Write something good.

245
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,777
- Write something good.

246
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,115
- It looks like the perp
knew what he was after.

247
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,751
All he took was a shipment
of thousand dollar

248
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,754
limited edition Weezies
designed by Little Wayne.

249
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,121
- Oh, it's Lil.

250
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,322
- Oh, like Lillian.
- No.

251
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,724
- Lillian Wayne. Okay.

252
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,459
- Okay.

253
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,195
Captain, I hope you're
wearing your evaluating pants,

254
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,496
'cause I'm about to put on
a crime solving clinic.

255
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,198
- I am wearing
my evaluating pants.

256
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,466
- What? 'Cause I was just—

257
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,234
Wait, what are
evaluating pants?

258
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,803
- They have a deep bottom
pocket for my notepad,

259
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,238
and they don't crease,
which is a must,

260
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,474
given how much
I squat during an evaluation.

261
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,310
- Mmkay, well there were
no witnesses to the crime,

262
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,245
which is weird since there was
a long line of sneaker-heads

263
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,214
right outside the window,
and you're actually squatting.

264
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,482
- Just, uh, ignore me.

265
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,450
Unless you can't.

266
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,352
- It's not a problem.
I love ignoring you.

267
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,854
Don't write that down.
But continuing with the case,

268
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,222
There were no signs
of forced entry.

269
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,456
- Hm.
- No fingerprints.

270
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,125
- Hmm.
- And no DNA evidence.

271
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,359
- Hmm.
- Okay, I can't ignore you.

272
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,095
What are you writing
down there?

273
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,362
- Probably that
you're crushing it, Jake,

274
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:17,530
because you are crushing it.

275
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,232
- Are you trying
to squat a peek?

276
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,801
- Of course I'm trying
to squat a peek,

277
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,769
but I also might be
solving the case.

278
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,270
Charles, come take a look at
this—there's a security camera

279
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,139
across the street
we didn't see before.

280
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,174
I have a feeling our answers
are in that footage.

281
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,776
Squat five.
- [grunts]

282
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,311
- Too far.
- I'll move closer.

283
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,346
- Still too far.
- A little closer.

284
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,781
- Getting closer.
- There we go.

285
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,550
[both grunting
and straining]

286
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,852
- [satisfied sigh]
- Worth it.

287
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,322
- I followed the flan.

288
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,257
I confronted Pimento about
La Palapa and he lied to me.

289
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,392
- [speaking Japanese]

290
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,294
- He denied ever even
hearing about the restaurant.

291
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:50,196
- Hmm, that is strange.
- And this morning,

292
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,798
he left the house
in clean clothes.

293
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,233
He never does that.
- Never?

294
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,534
- You need to follow him.

295
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,969
Catch him with his spoon
in the flan.

296
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,871
- That's exactly
what I was thinking.

297
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,339
I need to check out
a full surveillance kit.

298
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,573
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

299
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,508
That's against the rules.
Sarge?

300
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,577
- There are no rules when
it comes to cheating, Amy.

301
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,279
- I totally agree.

302
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,148
But unfortunately,
the NYPD does not.

303
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,350
I can't lend you department
equipment for personal use.

304
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,585
But there may be a work-around.
Hitchcock!

305
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,855
You have any surveillance
equipment Rosa can borrow?

306
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,489
- You mean my creep kit?

307
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,859
No prob.
Got another one in the car.

308
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,261
- See, Amy? That's what
a real friend looks like.

309
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,898
- Okay.
Security footage came in.

310
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,867
Let's see what we got.

311
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,501
- Probably a huge break.

312
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,236
- Well, let's not put too much
pressure on it. [laughs]

313
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,005
- You're right.
It's probably a dead end.

314
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,339
- Also not helpful.
- Let's just watch the footage.

315
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,975
- Yes. Great. All right, so,

316
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,277
here we have the camped-out
line of sneaker-heads.

317
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,578
Not much going on
around midnight.

318
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,213
Let's just fast-forward.
- It's okay.

319
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,581
- Still pretty calm
at around 1:00 a.m.

320
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,483
- That's all right.
- Fast forward.

321
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,251
And also looking a little bit
slow around 3:00 a.m.

322
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,954
- So, basically
it shows nothing.

323
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,890
- Or...

324
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,324
Does it show everything?

325
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,926
- Ooh!
[pencil clattering]

326
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,861
- Sorry not sorry.
It was just a stupid pencil.

327
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,496
- It was a gift
from my deceased father.

328
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,564
- A pencil?
Your dad gave pretty bad gifts.

329
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,366
[laughs]

330
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,902
Although on the other hand,
all my dad ever gave me

331
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,369
was abandonment issues,
so, potato-tomato.

332
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,371
But look at this.
Right around 4:00 a.m.,

333
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,873
the line moves down.

334
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,409
Everyone except
for that blue pup tent,

335
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,311
which is interesting.

336
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,013
- Oh, my boy's got a hunch.

337
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,514
He's got bunches of hunches.

338
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,316
- I think they didn't move down

339
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,483
because they didn't care
about their place in line.

340
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,219
I believe all they cared about

341
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,654
was the placement
of their tent, which was...

342
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,991
Right over this manhole cover.

343
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,328
And I wonder
what's behind this.

344
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,662
Hayouken!

345
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,364
Oh, look.

346
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,999
It's the sneaker store
stock room.

347
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,301
- Whoa.
How does he do it, folks?

348
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,636
- It was a team effort, Boyle.

349
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,071
Humble five?
- You know it.

350
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,006
both: Uh, I couldn't possibly.

351
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,507
- Of course
we still have no idea

352
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,009
who was in the blue pup tent.

353
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,544
- You know what?
There is no pleasing you.

354
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,379
- That is accurate.

355
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,981
[phone buzzing]

356
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,350
- [sighs]
What do you want?

357
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,584
- Hey.
- Hi, Rosa.

358
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,419
- How's the Pimento
stake out going?

359
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,255
Has he done anything
suspicious yet?

360
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,023
- No.
Just regular Pimento stuff.

361
00:10:57,057 --> 00:11:00,293
- [screaming hysterically]

362
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,530
- Ugh. It's like
he's going all norm-core

363
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,366
to through me off the scent.

364
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,601
- Or maybe it could be
Pimento wasn't cheating on you.

365
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,470
- What? You sound like
a real Amy right now.

366
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,072
- Hey.
- I know,

367
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,074
but even a broken Amy
can be right twice a day.

368
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,942
- Hey!

369
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,011
- We went to lunch at La Palapa
and we shared the flan.

370
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,312
- Oh, so you two
are boning now?

371
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,580
both: No!

372
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,548
- The flan's huge.
Everyone shares it.

373
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,517
The restaurant tells you to.
- Hmm.

374
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,719
- Maybe it's time to put
the creep kit away, Rosa.

375
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,421
- Wait.

376
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:29,522
Pimento just walked up
to a woman.

377
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,690
- A female woman?

378
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,659
Rosa, is it a female woman?

379
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,660
- They just kissed.

380
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,029
- Oh, no.

381
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,497
I'm so sorry, Rosa.

382
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,598
- Whatever.

383
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,533
Hope you enjoyed the flan.

384
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:44,004
- So, what's this about
a giant flan?

385
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,539
- The manager at the store
recognized the pup tent

386
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,574
from two previous
sneaker launches.

387
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,477
And he ID'd the owner
as one Morris Richman.

388
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,547
- Who just so happens
to work for Con Ed,

389
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,382
on underground
electrical wires.

390
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:00,453
- He also just so happens
to live a-right a-here.

391
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,155
[knocking]

392
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,090
You might wanna squat for this,
Mr. Evaluator.

393
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,659
- I decide when
the squatting is necessary.

394
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,332
This was my choice.

395
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,534
- Can I help you?
- NYPD.

396
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,701
Are you Morris Richman?

397
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,103
- Yes.
- And are those

398
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,171
Weezies?

399
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:19,705
- Yes.

400
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,507
- Well done, Peralta.
- Thank you.

401
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,610
But it wasn't me.
It was Steph...

402
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,679
Working through me.
[smooches]

403
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,414
- What is going on?

404
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,050
- Oh, he's been evaluating me.

405
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,617
It's been up and down,
but this is a clear win.

406
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,419
Oh, sorry, you mean
what's going on with you?

407
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,021
You're under arrest
for grand larceny.

408
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,356
- I didn't do anything.

409
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,458
Is this about the Weezies?

410
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,759
A friend gave them to me.

411
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:42,128
I'm innocent.
Come on, man, I'm innocent.

412
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,596
- Sure you are, buddy.

413
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,731
We all know you did it.

414
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,103
[gasps]

415
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,205
[knocking]
Charles!

416
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,374
We arrested the wrong guy.
- What?

417
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,709
- Morris Richman didn't do it.
We have to fix this right now.

418
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,378
- [sighs]

419
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,479
- I'll wait for you
to not be naked.

420
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,183
- This is really bad, Charles.

421
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,317
- Jake, can you please
spiral a little quieter?

422
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,152
Nikolaj is still asleep

423
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,453
and if he hears two men
arguing in the next room,

424
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,122
he might think
he's getting sold again.

425
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,756
- Aww, man,
his backstory is so sad.

426
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,292
- I know.
- Look.

427
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,094
I don't know how I screwed
this up, I mean,

428
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,062
maybe Holt got in my head
with all of his squatting.

429
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,397
- It was a powerful image.
- I think I rushed this all

430
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,165
so I could pass the evaluation.
Bottom line,

431
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,266
we arrested the wrong guy.

432
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,834
- What about the pup tent?

433
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,536
And the manhole?
And he was wearing Weezies.

434
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,338
- Maybe his friend gave them
to him just like he said.

435
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,772
- [sighs]
- We have no physical evidence

436
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,274
tying him to the stock room.

437
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,442
Plus, where are the rest
of the sneakers?

438
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,843
- [sighing]
Okay. So,

439
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,445
do we tell Captain Holt?

440
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,214
- No. Then he'll fail me
and I'll get suspended.

441
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,082
We gotta solve this on our own.

442
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:39,185
And I think I know how.
I found a lead on the dark web.

443
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,087
- Nice. The dark web.

444
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,555
It's the only place
you can buy quality bat meat.

445
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,225
- Mm. Gross.
Anyways, I posted a message

446
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,094
looking for Weezies and
I got pointed to MizzBK-Sneaks.

447
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,529
She put this pic up yesterday.

448
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,431
- Ah.
Those are our stolen shoes.

449
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,865
But who's MizzBK-Sneaks?

450
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,800
- Her name is Jenny McFadden.

451
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,170
She moves her merch out of the
back of a bodega on Willoughby.

452
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,804
- Cool, cool, cool, cool.
All right, one problem.

453
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,506
If we go to the bodega
looking like detectives,

454
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,841
we'll spook her.

455
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,243
- Right you are,
Charles my chum.

456
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,377
But we won't
look like detectives.

457
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,479
I brought all my best sneakers.

458
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,381
Get your fat,
sweaty feet ready.

459
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,815
- Yeah.

460
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,817
- We're gonna look
flippity-dippity-fly.

461
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,320
- Hey. So, you doing okay?

462
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,355
[loud clang]

463
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,123
- Not really.

464
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,358
I waited outside
that restaurant for two hours

465
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,525
and he never came out.

466
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,526
Cantaloupe?

467
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,594
- I'm good. Amy?

468
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,329
- Also good. Also good.

469
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,131
- I spent the whole night
riding my bike,

470
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,167
just thinking and riding,
riding and thinking.

471
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,568
Also, I drank some water
from the stream.

472
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,503
- And what did you figure out?

473
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,238
- I'm gonna dump his ass.
He should be here any minute.

474
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,506
- Oh, you're gonna do it
at work. That's great.

475
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,275
- There you are.

476
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,409
Babe, I've been
looking for you all night.

477
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,311
You didn't come home.

478
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,879
- 'Cause I knew if I did,
I would stab you in the face.

479
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,248
- Oh, Terry, we have
the thing in the other room.

480
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,849
- Mm-hmm.
- Phone...

481
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
- Yeah. Meeting. Uh, work.
Friend lunch. Yep.

482
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,289
- So is this
a sexy stab in the face?

483
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,923
Or an angry stab in the face?

484
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,825
[knife clatters]
- Don't play dumb with me.

485
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,660
I know about your mistress.
I know about La Palapa.

486
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,329
I know about the flan.

487
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,497
- Babe, wait.
- Oh, I've been waiting.

488
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,532
I waited all night to do this.

489
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,900
We're done. It's over.

490
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,303
- What? No.
[groans]

491
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,337
[sighs]

492
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,905
I don't have a mistress.

493
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,308
That woman's name
is Señora Reyes.

494
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,575
She's my Spanish teacher.

495
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:11,277
- Oh, please.
- No, I'm serious.

496
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,578
The only reason
we were even at La Palapa

497
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,314
was so I can practice
ordering in Spanish.

498
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,548
Ah—by the way...

499
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,452
[speaking Spanish]

500
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,453
- It did?

501
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,556
- [speaking Spanish]

502
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,861
- Oh, my God.

503
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,530
Oh, my God.

504
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,932
Adrian, I'm so sorry.
You must be so mad at me.

505
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,600
- What? No, of course
I'm not mad at you.

506
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,337
Are you kidding? Jealousy's,
like, the hottest emotion.

507
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,404
Let's do this.

508
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,505
- Okay, let's do it.

509
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,308
- [groans]

510
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,244
- All right. This guy
looks like the gatekeeper.

511
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,578
Just follow my lead.
- Okay.

512
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,282
[clears throat]
- Hey, how are ya?

513
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,451
Just grabbing a couple things.

514
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:55,355
- Ham puffs, a single tampon,
and a hot rod magazine?

515
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,956
- Know how we do.
- Ahh.

516
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,558
[both laugh]

517
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,593
- Hey, listen, we're looking
to score some kicks.

518
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,594
You know
where we can find some?

519
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,429
- Yeah. The mall.

520
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,332
- The mall. What do we look
like, Jay and Silent Bob?

521
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,402
[all laugh]

522
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,338
- Actually, yeah.

523
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,706
- Fair enough.

524
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,341
- Look, we're friends
with Jenny McFadden.

525
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,478
- Okay.
Well, if that's true,

526
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,713
tell me what her
favorite shoe is.

527
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,215
- Old school Impala All-Stars.

528
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,986
- Okay. I'll go get her.
- Great.

529
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,688
I can't believe that worked.

530
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,590
I just guessed the coolest shoe
I knew and I was right.

531
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,591
Nope, he's running away.

532
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,393
[crashes]

533
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,961
- Ugh, these shoes
are so uncomfortable!

534
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,530
- They're dress sneakers,

535
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,964
you're not supposed
to run in them.

536
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,467
Freeze!

537
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,503
NYPD. Let me see your hands.

538
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,271
- [sighs]
I didn't do anything.

539
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,639
- Then why were you running?

540
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,740
- I didn't want any trouble.
I have two priors.

541
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,375
- Where is Jenny McFadden?

542
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:50,943
- There is no Jenny McFadden.

543
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,778
That's a cover for the dude
who steals the shoes.

544
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,480
His name is Morris Richman.

545
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,349
- Oh, no.

546
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,717
No, no, no, no, no.
- Why are you freaking out?

547
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,784
- This is great.
You were right all along.

548
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,520
It was Morris Richman.

549
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,621
You'll definitely pass
your evaluation now.

550
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,689
- Yeah, the only thing is...

551
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,592
- You let Morris Richman go?

552
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,596
- Single tampon?

553
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,834
- I am in shock, Peralta.

554
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,669
I can't believe
you released Morris Richman.

555
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,937
We have evidence.

556
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,905
- Great evidence
that Jake found.

557
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,941
- Exactly, which makes it even
worse that he let him go.

558
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,976
- That's not fair. I was trying
to help, but he tricked me.

559
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,011
- You blew this case.
You bungled your evaluation,

560
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,681
and you never retrieved
my father's pencil.

561
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,316
- Sir, I am happy
to get you a new pencil.

562
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,651
- It won't be the same.
And now you're just

563
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,018
standing here, mum as a mouse.

564
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,687
Have you nothing to say
for yourself?

565
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,622
- I can explain.
- Of course he can.

566
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,758
My boy's got bunches
of explunches. Hit 'em, Jake.

567
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,793
- I'm not ready to be back.

568
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,628
You should suspend me.
- What?

569
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,765
- Look,
when we arrested Richman

570
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,401
and he said he didn't do it,
I just—

571
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,002
I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

572
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,637
I mean, what if he was
telling the truth?

573
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,972
What if he was innocent

574
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,040
and I was putting
an innocent man in jail?

575
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,909
It's just...

576
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,044
Feels a lot harder for me
to put another human being

577
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,647
in prison after
experiencing it myself.

578
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,015
It's really horrible.

579
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,717
Look, I wanted
to be back in the field,

580
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,118
because I wanted
to be the old me,

581
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:09,822
but the truth is,
I'm not the old me yet.

582
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,090
Maybe I never will be.

583
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,628
Anyways, I'm gonna
go cry in the bathroom.

584
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,663
Peace out, homies.
[laughs]

585
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,802
- Hey. What's going on?

586
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,370
I thought
everything worked out.

587
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,705
Is there a reason
you're still upset?

588
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,072
- What makes you
think I'm upset?

589
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,008
- The giant hole
you carved into the table.

590
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,843
- Oops. Didn't notice.

591
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,446
There. Fixed it.

592
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,114
- Look, I get it.

593
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,782
You feel guilty about
accusing him of cheating.

594
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,818
That's on me.

595
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,421
I encouraged you because of all
my unresolved Chiaki issues.

596
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,056
[speaking Japanese]

597
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,125
- No, it's not that,
it's just—

598
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,060
Last night, when I ended
things with Adrian,

599
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,396
I had this huge feeling
of relief.

600
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,931
It's the first time in
a long time

601
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,399
that I felt like myself again.

602
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,067
- Oh, Rosa.

603
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,702
- I think I got so worked up
about him cheating on me

604
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,170
because I wanted it to be true.

605
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,072
I needed an excuse
to end things.

606
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,042
And now
I don't know what to do.

607
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,110
- I think
you do know what to do.

608
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,813
- Thanks, Amy.

609
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,449
[knife clatters]

610
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,118
- I have no idea
what she's gonna do

611
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,854
but that's the safest way
to give Rosa advice.

612
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,021
- Yep.

613
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,058
- Packing your desk.

614
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,826
That's a major downer.

615
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,528
- Yeah, so why
are you smiling like that?

616
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,929
- We found Morris Richman.

617
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,698
- Nuh-uh, Jake found him.

618
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,433
- We talked about this, Boyle.

619
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:28,768
We agreed that if you
couldn't keep it together,

620
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:29,769
you couldn't be a part of this.

621
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,870
- I'll be good.

622
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,138
- We went through
your case file,

623
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,907
and everything
we needed was there.

624
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,176
Richman's aliases,
his known associates,

625
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,745
and an address in Queens
that he used as a safe house.

626
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,013
The 2-7 just picked him up.

627
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,014
- Tell him the other stuff.
Tell him.

628
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,082
Tell him now.

629
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,750
Yeah. I can't be here.

630
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,988
- When you demanded
to be put back on the field,

631
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,723
I worried
that you were being flippant

632
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,458
about your time in prison.

633
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,860
I thought you would
be reckless, but I was wrong.

634
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,463
Prison has made you
more cautious.

635
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:00,199
- Yeah, but what if
I'm too cautious now?

636
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,067
I mean, I used to see
everything as black and white,

637
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,470
and now,
it's looking real gray to me.

638
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,172
- I wish every cop had a voice
in their head asking,

639
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,041
what if he's innocent?

640
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,143
You see it as weakness,
but it means you're growing.

641
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,579
It makes you
a better detective.

642
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,014
So, you passed your evaluation.

643
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,482
You can go back in the field.

644
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:18,117
- Oh.

645
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,485
[laughs]

646
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,053
Wow.

647
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,822
Thank you for passing me.

648
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:24,156
But I actually feel like

649
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,526
I need a little bit
more time to readjust.

650
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,894
I think I should ride the desk
for a few more weeks.

651
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,031
- I respect that.

652
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,535
- Okay, Charles,
you can come hug us now.

653
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,902
We know you're still there.

654
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,504
- I never left.
- Ugh!

655
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,905
- Thank you for understanding.

656
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,040
- Yeah.

657
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,042
- Oh. Look.

658
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,044
- Oh, boy.

659
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,047
- Here's your blood back.
- Mm.

660
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,950
Well, in that case,

661
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,818
I guess you should have
your blood back too.

662
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,587
- What? How did you get this?

663
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,121
- You know, I might want
a couple minutes up here alone.

664
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,824
Just to kinda process this,
you know.

665
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,226
- Of course.

666
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,563
[smooches]

667
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,532
[door creaks]

668
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,067
- [deep sigh]

669
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,536
- So, how'd it go?

670
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,937
- It actually went
surprisingly well—

671
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,906
[loud bang]
- [screaming]

672
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,209
[sobbing]

673
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,812
No! Rosa!

674
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,915
[wailing hysterically]

675
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,118
- Honestly, this is the best
I could've asked for.

676
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,220
- Not a doctor. Shh.
