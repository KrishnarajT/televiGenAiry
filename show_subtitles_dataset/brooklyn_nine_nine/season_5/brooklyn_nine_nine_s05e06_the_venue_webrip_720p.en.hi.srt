00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,464
- Yeah, about that...

178
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,199
- Wait, what's wrong?
Something's wrong.

179
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,467
That's the look my mom gave me
right before

180
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,202
she told me that my dad left.

181
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,171
Oh, God, did my dad leave
my mom again?

182
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,405
How do you know my mom and dad?
- You know, I'm so sorry.

183
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,606
There must have been a mix-up.

184
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,475
Someone just contacted
my manager

185
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,344
and booked the venue
before you got here.

186
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,379
- But we had an oral agreement.

187
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,249
You said we had until
the end of the day—EOD.

188
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,484
It's not EOD.
The D hasn't E'd.

189
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,353
It won't be E'd for ages!

190
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,288
- I'm sorry.
It's out of my hands, you know?

191
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,223
Someone just swooped in
and got it.

192
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,259
- Wait.
Susan—Susan!

193
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,627
- [gasping] Who?
Who would do that?

194
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,529
- Amy, we had something great
in the palm of our hands,

195
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,198
and then someone swooped in
at the last minute

196
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,532
and stole it?

197
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,134
There's only one person
who would do that.

198
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,103
- No.
But... it couldn't be!

199
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,204
- Ah, but it is.

200
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,205
[metal guitar riff]

201
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,273
both: The Vulture!

202
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,075
- [cackling]
Suckers.

203
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,310
- Oh, no.
Our nups have been un-toitened.

204
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,611
We've got loose nups.

205
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,149
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

206
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,517
What's your game here,
Vulture, huh?

207
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,785
Why are you renting our venue?

208
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,220
- Why do you think, meat farts?

209
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,821
I'm getting married.
- Really?

210
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,523
You once told me that marriage
is for women and gays.

211
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,092
- And that the only thing
you're married to

212
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,293
is banging married chicks.

213
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,494
- Yeah, and I meant it all.

214
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,430
But love?
Love hath changed me.

215
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,732
- No it hathn't.
You just vultured our venue.

216
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,267
- Yeah, but I did it for love.

217
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,169
My fiancée,
she means everything to me.

218
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,270
You know,
she's hot like a chick,

219
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,771
she's smart like a guy.

220
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,273
Just talking to her
gives me a Harrelson.

221
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,308
- Harrelson?
- Woody.

222
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,842
- Ew.
- Yeah.

223
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,411
Look, I know I've become
that gross, sappy guy,

224
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,512
but dude, she's the first chick
I ever wanted

225
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,846
to hang out with post-bang.

226
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,115
- I can't believe a real person

227
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,282
has agreed to marry you.

228
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:57,417
- Oh, my lady's real,
all right.

229
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,219
Her name is Jean Munhroe,

230
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,154
and we complete the living hell
out of each other...

231
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,422
sometimes twice a night.

232
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:03,789
[both groan]
[cell phone twangs]

233
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,158
Hey, you know what?

234
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,526
I need to handle this
right now.

235
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,361
Look, I know how hard it is
to find a venue.

236
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,829
But if it could happen for me,
it could happen for you.

237
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,197
- It happened for you

238
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,298
because it did happen for us.

239
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,499
- Chins up, dingdongs.

240
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,301
I'm trying to be happy
over here.

241
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,436
- Ugh.
- [scoffs]

242
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,138
- Jake, what are we gonna do?

243
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,106
We already gave deposits
to all our vendors.

244
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,374
- We're gonna get
this place back.

245
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,775
- How?
The Vulture's not gonna budge.

246
00:07:22,808 --> 00:07:23,876
- Yeah, maybe, but he does

247
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,179
have a weak spot: his woman.

248
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,448
Not that women are weak.
Just, she's our best shot,

249
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,116
and she happens to be a woman.
- Totally.

250
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,851
Let's go talk to
that spineless skank.

251
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,453
- Yeah.

252
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,888
- Why do we even have
police horses anymore?

253
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:38,191
We have motorcycles now.
They're faster, cooler.

254
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,792
They also don't get boners
in the background

255
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,794
of every photo
of you and the mayor.

256
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,363
- What do you mean?
A horse is a perfect partner.

257
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,331
Tough, scary,
and they don't show you

258
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:48,301
30 pictures of their kid
dressed as Wario for Halloween.

259
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,469
I'm not talking about Nikolaj.

260
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,903
- I literally just showed you

261
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:52,305
those pictures
five minutes ago.

262
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,906
- Really?
I don't remember that.

263
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:54,907
- Hmm.
[horse chuffs]

264
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,878
[tense music]

265
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,147
NYPD!
Hands where we can see 'em!

266
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,482
- Step away from Peanut Butter.

267
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,916
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on?

268
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,818
You guys thought
you could catch me?

269
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,488
[lighter clicks]

270
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,489
[horse neighs]

271
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,856
- [grunts]

272
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,292
I'll head him off.

273
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,227
- Fine,
I'll get the dumb horse.

274
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,361
[grunts]

275
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,630
All right.
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

276
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,332
[strains]
Come on, you idiot!

277
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,301
[grunting]

278
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,302
Run!

279
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,869
Ugh, you dumb horse.

280
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:24,904
Ha!

281
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,306
[horse whinnies]

282
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,507
[screaming]
Peanut Butter!

283
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,211
[screaming]

284
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,412
[horse whinnying]

285
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,280
Stop!
Peanut Butter, stop!

286
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,581
Stop!
- Boyle!

287
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,517
Just let go!

288
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,652
- Okay, we have to force
the She-Vulture,

289
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,287
Jean Munhroe, to give us
our venue back,

290
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,655
so put on your game face,

291
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,390
'cause we're about to
stare down the devil.

292
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,458
- Devil can't stare
if the devil's got

293
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,526
tears in her eyes

294
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,593
and blood in her ears.

295
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,961
- Oh, I love your intensity.

296
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:50,330
All right,
this is where she works.

297
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,631
"The Zenith Fund."

298
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,466
Ulch, it even sounds evil.

299
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,934
- Of course it is.
She's marrying the Vulture.

300
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,369
Everything about her is evil.

301
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,271
- Time to enter
the den of bastards

302
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,539
who deserve to die.

303
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,676
All right, snake,
show your face—it's a charity.

304
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,411
Amy, it's a charity.

305
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,447
- Look at this:
"Jean, your selflessness

306
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,581
"puts us all to shame.

307
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,483
Humbled, Michelle Obama."

308
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,952
both: Damn, Jean.

309
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,687
- Hi.
Can I help you?

310
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,357
- Uh, yes.
We're looking for Jean Munhroe.

311
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,425
We know her fiancé.
- Oh, I'm Jean.

312
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,461
Are you Jake and Amy?

313
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,962
Keith has told me
all about you.

314
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,630
He says you guys are the best.
- Really?

315
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,300
Keith says that?
- [laughing] Yeah—oh, Janice?

316
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,469
That village needs rice.
Double the last shipment.

317
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:32,305
Just take the overage
out of my paycheck.

318
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,707
So, what brings you guys
to the Zenith Fund?

319
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,543
- Uh... actually,
something super important—

320
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,245
[cell phone vibrates]
- Oh, I am so sorry.

321
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,281
I've gotta take this.
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,283
- What do you mean,
"roadblock"?

323
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,684
Do I have to fly down there
and talk to the rebels myself?

324
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,486
Just get the rice
to those kids.

325
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,988
Asante sana, Rafiki.

326
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,423
Sorry about that.

327
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,991
- Wow, your job sounds
very intense.

328
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,726
- No, no, no, it's nothing
compared to what

329
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,595
these children go through
on a daily basis.

330
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,930
It really puts things
in perspective.

331
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:58,998
- Right.
- So,

332
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,500
what was the important thing

333
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,534
you came down here
to talk about?

334
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,304
- Uh... the kids.

335
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,472
And the rice.
- And...

336
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:10,009
putting the rice...
in the kids.

337
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,646
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we have two new donors!

338
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,747
[applause and bell ringing]

339
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,015
- Yay!

340
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,517
- Ooh, there's a bell.

341
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,018
- Oh!
- [laughs]

342
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,555
[in southern accent]
Do y'all have an ATM?

343
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,958
- Sir, can I get $350
in petty cash?

344
00:10:25,991 --> 00:10:27,360
I need to throw
an ice cream party

345
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,628
for Teri-with-an-I,
make sure

346
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,596
there's no hard feelings.
- Why?

347
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,365
She gets it was
a misunderstanding.

348
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,066
She's a Teri,
and you're a Terrance who,

349
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,601
even though he's not a child,

350
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,537
still goes by a nickname
ending in a Y.

351
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,005
- I mean,
don't people call you Ray?

352
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,407
- How dare you.

353
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,775
- Sir, I don't want any tension

354
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,411
between the squad
and the uniformed officers.

355
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,712
I'm just thinking
about the precinct.

356
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,514
- You're lying.

357
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,082
You're upset because
Teri-with-an-I called you

358
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:51,517
arrogant, and you have

359
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,985
a pathological need
to be liked.

360
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:55,054
- What?
No, I don't.

361
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,789
I just happen to be
a great person

362
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,658
who's naturally beloved
by all—

363
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,526
despite my personal
ambivalence.

364
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,528
- Well, if that's true,
then you won't mind

365
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,796
walking across the bullpen

366
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,432
without saying hello
to anybody.

367
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,700
- [scoffs]
No problem.

368
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,535
- No nods allowed.

369
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,636
- What?

370
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,338
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

371
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,806
You're a busy sergeant.

372
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,040
They can't always expect you
to be friendly.

373
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,075
[inhales deeply]

374
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,777
Time to go to frown town.

375
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,645
Let's do this, Jeffords.

376
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,813
- Hey, Sarge.
- Bill!

377
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,415
[laughs]
What up, man?

378
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,683
[dramatic music]

379
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,717
You were right.

380
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,786
Terry loves to be loved!

381
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,622
Hey, Monica!
Hey, Dough. [laughs]

382
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,425
Ooh, who wants a nod?
[laughs]

383
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,827
- Hey.
Any luck finding a new venue

384
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,662
that's available on May 15th?
- Yeah.

385
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,798
May 15, 2026.
- [sighs]

386
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,433
- Please tell me the vendors
are giving us back

387
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,701
our deposits.
- Yes.

388
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,403
One of them.
The photographer.

389
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,737
Provided that you
hang out with him,

390
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,105
so how do you feel about
spending the weekend

391
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,373
on his houseboat in Yonkers?

392
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,574
- Ugh, Jake.

393
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,842
Forget the perfect wedding.

394
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,511
We're screwed.
- I know.

395
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,712
- I can't believe
that saint of a woman

396
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,113
is actually marrying
the Vulture.

397
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,781
- [sighs]
Maybe he's changed.

398
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,849
- How is that even possible?
- I don't know.

399
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,384
Nothing makes sense anymore.

400
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,452
The Vulture's not the Vulture,

401
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,786
good is bad, up is down,

402
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,121
there's a young pope,
winter has come.

403
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,389
That reminds me:
I ordered

404
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,457
some premium cable channels.

405
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,592
[cell phone twangs]

406
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,561
- Hitchcock?
What was that sound?

407
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,463
- I just got an alert
from my hookup app.

408
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,365
I'm about to boink
with a local single in my area.

409
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,768
- Ames.
- Jake.

410
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,869
- Ames.
- Jake!

411
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,771
- Ames!
- Jake!

412
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,105
- Up is up, down is down,
the Vulture still boinks!

413
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,607
[cell phone twangs]

414
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,576
- I need to handle this
right now.

415
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,144
- I can't believe that bastard
is cheating on nice Jean.

416
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,612
- We have to save her.
We have to break them up.

417
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,514
- For nice Jean!
- And the starving kids.

418
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:30,082
- And Michelle Obama.
- And a little side benefit:

419
00:12:30,115 --> 00:12:32,084
if we break them up,
we get our venue back.

420
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:33,619
- Yes, but the main reason
is to save a wonderful person

421
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,887
from making a horrible mistake.

422
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,589
- Of course.
That's obviously the point.

423
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,890
The venue is just secondary.

424
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,158
- What venue?
We're great people.

425
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,561
- Hey, Jake.

426
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,662
- See?

427
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,533
- Okay, so the Vulture
is cheating on Jean Munhroe,

428
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,168
which totally tracks, because
he is the epitome of awful.

429
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,636
- Ooh, nice use of "epitome."
- Thanks, babe.

430
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,204
My question is,
why pretend to change?

431
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:53,639
I mean, why get married at all?

432
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,207
- I'll tell you why.

433
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,510
Because Jean's dad
is worth $100 million,

434
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,944
and she's his only heir.

435
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,212
- Then why did she need
our $1,000?

436
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,915
I mean, I'm so happy
we gave the money

437
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,450
so the kids could have rice
and et cetera.

438
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,951
- So, how do we break them up?
- Simple.

439
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,587
We catfish him
with Hitchcock's hookup app.

440
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,889
Then, when he takes the bait,
we make him end things

441
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,691
with Jean respectfully
and gently.

442
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,225
- Perfect.
She hurts for a bit,

443
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:14,694
but she eventually moves on,

444
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,995
and she finds
a much better man.

445
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,563
- Yes.
And as a distant,

446
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:18,664
secondary benefit,
we get the mansion back.

447
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,032
- Agreed.
Okay.

448
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,034
So, let's create a temptress

449
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,969
that will boink-match with him.
- Yeah.

450
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,238
- What's the sexiest name?
- Valerie.

451
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:28,541
- That was fast.
Do you know a Valerie?

452
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,542
- [chuckling]
No.

453
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,711
I wish.

454
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,479
[clears throat]
All right, she's 19,

455
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,915
from Daytona, and her job
is "spray tannist."

456
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,717
- Ugh, "tannist."
Not a real word.

457
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,718
It's perfect.
- Yeah.

458
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,219
- Okay, she's into

459
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,522
spring break, bong rips,
slurping shots,

460
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,256
and crop tops that say
"little cutie."

461
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,258
- Noice.
- She is not into...

462
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,194
nerds, wearing pants,
needy guys, monogamy,

463
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,196
or feminism,
and her quote is,

464
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,132
"Whatever happened
to 'Girls Gone Wild'?"

465
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,935
- [chuckles] This Valerie
sounds like a real pill.

466
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,603
[chuckles, clears throat]

467
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,039
- Okay.
Let's see who our matches are.

468
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,107
- Here we go.

469
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,609
- [clears throat]
- Uh-huh.

470
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,110
Gross, mm-hmm.

471
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,012
Oh, Hitchcock.

472
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,049
I mean, "Dave, age 28"?

473
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,617
- Ugh.
- Come on.

474
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,052
- Oh!
- Gotcha.

475
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,587
- There he is.
All right.

476
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,589
And so begins
the delicate dance.

477
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,624
We begin with a simple hello.

478
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,292
And then we wait, so as
not to seem too aggressive—

479
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,727
No, he sent us a picture
of his penis!

480
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,228
- [gasps]
[computer twanging]

481
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,964
- Oh, God,
he just sent 15 more.

482
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,131
- Oh, God, it's horrible.
But it's wonderful.

483
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,767
We're gonna save Jean!

484
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,001
- Yes, and we're gonna
get the mansion back!

485
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,269
- Oh, no.

486
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,270
- Yeah, he put a
little hat on it.

487
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,304
- Ugh.

488
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,039
- Hey, there you are.

489
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,775
You okay?
- Yeah, no burns.

490
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,977
The doctor said I was lucky
my body was so damp.

491
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,612
- So why did it take so long?
- Well, the EMT spent

492
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,013
loads of time on Peanut Butter.

493
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,114
But you know what?

494
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,315
I don't care, because I saved

495
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:45,050
that dumb horse,
so I'm the hero.

496
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,052
And this time,
when I get my medal,

497
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,654
my whole face will be
in the picture.

498
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:49,722
- You haven't seen "The Post,"
have you?

499
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,090
- What?
No.

500
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,558
Why?
- Somebody was walking

501
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:53,559
by the fire
and took a picture

502
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,994
on their cell phone.

503
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,662
- What?
That's not what happened.

504
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,130
I saved him.

505
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,632
- That's not how
they're reporting it.

506
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,667
- No, look.
"Daily News" got it right.

507
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,068
Yeah.

508
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,571
"Hero Cop Saves
Helpless Buffoon."

509
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,641
Oh, no.
Am I the buffoon?

510
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,209
- Uh-oh, dropped your phone.
Now we'll never know.

511
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,611
- [sighs]
Wait.

512
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,078
There was a dash cam
in the car.

513
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,780
We have footage
of what really happened!

514
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,649
- Brass already called.
They don't want us releasing

515
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,150
that footage.
A hero horse is good PR

516
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,252
for the department.
Hey, man, uh...

517
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:21,587
Peanut Butter's going
on "Ellen."

518
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,356
- "Ellen"?
That's my dream!

519
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,293
[sighs] Now he gets to dance
with DJ tWitch!

520
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,295
- What's going on here?

521
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,832
- I'm throwing Teri-with-an-I's
party with my own money.

522
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,700
I didn't know her favorite
kind of ice cream,

523
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,301
so I printed a photo of her
and showed it

524
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,804
to all the ice cream places
within 30 blocks.

525
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,205
Nobody recognized her,

526
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,374
so I got every flavor—
200 pints.

527
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:43,709
- This is the greatest day
of my life.

528
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,044
- Have you considered

529
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,712
this Teri-with-an-I might not

530
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,114
be an ice cream person?
- I did think that.

531
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,382
That's why there's
a taco bar coming.

532
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:52,217
- Yes.
- Plus barbecue.

533
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,753
- Yes.
- Plus a popcorn guy.

534
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,220
- [laughing] Yes.
- Plus vegan options.

535
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,288
- Why?
- Sergeant,

536
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,057
you've become unhinged.

537
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,224
There's always gonna
be people in this world

538
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,259
who don't like you.

539
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,661
That's a fact of life.

540
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:02,662
- I hear you, sir.

541
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:03,863
But I hate the feeling

542
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,197
of people being mad at me.

543
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,866
- So what?

544
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,768
I was voted least friendly
in high school,

545
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,135
and here I am,
a police captain.

546
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,137
Do you know what Mr. Popularity

547
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,139
Vincent Mondale is doing
these days?

548
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,275
He's a sociologist,
for God's sake.

549
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,177
Sociologist, Terry.

550
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,879
- I'm sorry,
but I gotta do this.

551
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,381
- Okay, but just know...

552
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,416
if you go through
with this party,

553
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:25,851
I will like you less.

554
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,888
[dramatic music]

555
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,656
- Hello, Vulture.
Got a minute?

556
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,157
Doesn't matter.
We don't care.

557
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,859
- Let me guess.
You guys are here to cry

558
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,294
about the wedding venue
that I stole from you

559
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,162
fair and square, right?
- No.

560
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,164
Actually, we wanna talk to you
about some other things.

561
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,834
Like spring break,
slurping shots,

562
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,435
and hating pants.

563
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:45,705
- Wait a second,
why does that sound familiar?

564
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,340
- I don't know.
Maybe you should ask... Valerie.

565
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:50,843
Yeah, that's right.
We catfished you.

566
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,377
- Boom.
- You're Valerie?

567
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,913
Ah, I can't believe
I actually wasted

568
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,848
my sweet dong snaps
on you bozos.

569
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,718
- All right,
here's how this is gonna go.

570
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,352
You are gonna break up
with Jean,

571
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:01,687
because we all know you're just

572
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,222
marrying her for her money.

573
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,790
- You're gonna do it nicely
and respectfully,

574
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,325
and you're gonna make
a generous donation

575
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,459
to her charity.
- Nice touch, Ames.

576
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:08,828
- You guys got it all wrong.

577
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,929
I don't care that she's rich.

578
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,930
Look, I love her.

579
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,464
I just got spooked.

580
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:13,833
You put a vulture into a cage,
and...

581
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,367
[squawks]
It freaks out.

582
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,936
- Actually, vultures do
very well in captivity

583
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,371
and they mate for life.
- Research burn.

584
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,206
- All right, look.
I'm deleting the app

585
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,341
from my phone
as we speak, okay?

586
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,376
Come on.
Jean's over 30.

587
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,945
No amount of money
in the entire world

588
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,346
could make me marry
a woman that old.

589
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,214
But love can.
And will.

590
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,349
- You have two options.

591
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,784
Either you break up with her...

592
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,753
- Or we send her
the penis pics—

593
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,288
even the one next to the—
I'm guessing, a mini soda can?

594
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,790
- Nah, it was regular size.
- Really?

595
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,159
- Oh, Jean's here.
So what's it gonna be?

596
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,895
You gonna tell her,
or do we have to?

597
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,329
- I've changed.
- Nope.

598
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,798
- I won't do it again.
- Nope.

599
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,332
- [groans]
I'll give you the venue.

600
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,234
- Oh.
- What's that?

601
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,736
- I'll give you the venue
if you don't say anything,

602
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,271
but if you do,
I'm gonna keep it.

603
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,272
Even if she and I break up,
all right?

604
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,373
I love her.

605
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,976
I promise you this.

606
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,243
both: Deal.
- Okay.

607
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,879
Now just act normal, please.

608
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,747
- Oh, wow.
What a surprise.

609
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,515
My donors.
- Hello, Jean Munhroe!

610
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:04,950
- Nice to see you,
Jean Munhroe!

611
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,121
- You all looked so intense
when I got here.

612
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,255
What were you talking about?

613
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,256
- Crime scene.
- Soup.

614
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,958
Uh—soup crime scene.

615
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,259
The Chowder Killer's
back at it again.

616
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,061
- Oh, I haven't heard of him.

617
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,130
- Yeah, well, he just moved
to Manhattan...

618
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,999
from New England.

619
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,201
- You guys are so lucky
to all work together.

620
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,404
Oh, my gosh,
what is Keith like at work?

621
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,807
- Aw, Keith?
Our Keith?

622
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,108
- [chuckles dully]
- Well, he's a real crack-up,

623
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,275
I'll tell you that for free.

624
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,177
We have so many inside jokes.

625
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,412
- So many inside jokes.
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,180
- Hey, guys—potato salad?

627
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,817
[all laughing]

628
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,284
- You wouldn't understand.
It's from work.

629
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,953
- Oh, my gosh,
you guys are so crazy.

630
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,855
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

631
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,156
- So how did you two meet?

632
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,091
- Oh, someone stole
from my charity,

633
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
and another detective was
working on the case so hard

634
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,029
for months,
and Keith came in,

635
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,264
and solved it right away.

636
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,966
Swooped in like an eagle.

637
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,968
- That's why my nickname's
the Eagle.

638
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,302
Right, guys?
- Yep.

639
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,172
Everyone calls him...

640
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,907
[struggling]
The Eagle.

641
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,342
- So, when did you
decide to propose?

642
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,412
- Oh—ah, well, we were
just hanging out one night,

643
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:11,016
and I looked over at Amy
and it hit me.

644
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,186
She's incredible
and my best friend,

645
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,288
and I just knew
in that moment...

646
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,990
I wanted to spend
my life with her.

647
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,158
- I know what you mean.

648
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,993
Keith and I are the same way.

649
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,196
It is so nice to finally find
someone I can trust.

650
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,131
[both groaning]
- Oh, boy.

651
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,900
- I can't do this.
- Yeah, it's bad.

652
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,202
- Jean, we have to
show you something.

653
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,938
- No!
- A penis? Why?

654
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,874
- Yep,
should've explained it first.

655
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,075
- Reese Witherspoon
is optioning

656
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,342
the Peanut Butter story?

657
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,344
What?
- Forget that dumb horse.

658
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,880
Have you seen this?

659
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,950
- "Exclusive Dash Cam
Footage Reveals

660
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,086
Hero Cop Saved
Sergeant Peanut Butter."

661
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,188
I don't understand.
How'd they get this?

662
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,355
- Somebody must have leaked it.

663
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,991
Perfect partner isn't a horse.

664
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,292
The perfect partner
is somebody who,

665
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,027
no matter how much
they hate you,

666
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,128
would run through a fire
to save your life.

667
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,496
- Aw.
Thank you, Rosa.

668
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,132
- You're welcome.
All right, come with me.

669
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,134
We're going to Shaw's.

670
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,236
- Whoa, all this is for me?
- Yep.

671
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,238
You saved Peanut Butter,
even though he's a dick.

672
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,174
- He is a dick.
- To Charles Boyle, everybody!

673
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,076
all: To Charles Boyle!

674
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,078
- Thanks, guys.

675
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,014
- So, Terry, you decided
not to throw a party

676
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,949
for Teri-with-an-I?
- You were right.

677
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,483
Why bother trying
to win over a stranger

678
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,120
when I can make someone
I care about happy instead?

679
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,422
- Well, for the record,
Jeffords...

680
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,291
I like you a lot
and I always have.

681
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,128
- All right.
Whatever.

682
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,395
- I taught him well.

683
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,464
- Who am I kidding?
Terry needs a hug!

684
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,533
[laughing]
- Mm?

685
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,201
[upbeat music]

686
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,103
- Hey, I'm still
a little shaken up.

687
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,272
We did the right thing, right?
- Yes, definitely.

688
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,506
She's way better off
without him.

689
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,375
- And she let him know it.

690
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,509
- Yeah, for a human angel,
girl could throw down.

691
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,245
- I hate wasting rice...

692
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,380
but I hate you more!

693
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,249
- She may be the coolest woman
I've ever met.

694
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,151
- Yeah.
- So, what's up

695
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,252
with the wedding?
Do we need to find a new venue?

696
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,519
- Actually, we found a place

697
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,121
that's available
on the same date.

698
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,422
- Ooh, is it another mansion?

699
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,958
- No, it is not.

700
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,092
- Listen up, everybody!

701
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,460
We are getting married

702
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,528
in a public rec center!
- Super cheap!

703
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,397
- On a basketball court!
- Squeak-squeak!

704
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,399
- With one working bathroom!
- Ladies gotta wait!

705
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,968
- And it's in
deep Staten Island.

706
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,203
- Destination wedding, y'all!

707
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,504
But the point is,

708
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,339
these nuptials are still
gonna be...

709
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,008
mad toit.

710
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,276
I would marry you
in a dumpster.

711
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,378
- Aww, I would marry you
in a dumpster.

712
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,346
- Dudes, the Vulture's throwing

713
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,516
an all-girl pudding wrestling
party in a mansion in May!

714
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,087
It's the only important thing
happening that day!

715
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,388
- After party?
- Fits our budget.

716
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,392
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
