- Yeah.

2

No matter what we do,
he just won't leave.

3
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:07,504
- The problem is you're
thinking like detectives.

4
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:08,810
- No, I'm definitely not.
- When you should

5
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:11,334
be thinking like a bird.

6
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:14,250
This is Operation:
Saving Private Pigeon.

7
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:16,339
On my mark, I will
turn on this fan,

8
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:18,602
gently startling our bird
due east,

9
00:00:18,646 --> 00:00:20,474
into the file box canyon,
where he will

10
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,737
encounter Charles holding
two pot lids.

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,391
He'll bang them together,

12
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:26,393
forcing Private Pigeon
into the ceiling there

13
00:00:26,436 --> 00:00:27,698
and out of the ceiling there,

14
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:29,744
where he will be greeted
by scary Rosa

15
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:31,441
holding a scary picture
of an owl.

16
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:32,921
Now he's playing our game.

17
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:35,402
He'll veer left,
into an upside down garbage can

18
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:36,881
propped up by a hockey stick

19
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,535
and connected to a string
that Gina is holding.

20
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,841
She pulls it, he is trapped,

21
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:41,538
and Terry releases him
outside.

22
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:43,975
- Terry hates birds.
- Okay, little friend.

23
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:46,282
Let's get you home
to mama.

24

It comes with both
the amino acid reducer

No. I only signed up

I'm not selling NutriBoom.
It's clearly a pyramid scheme.

37
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:34,417
- First off, it's not
a pyramid scheme.

38
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,071
It's a conical-tiered
multi-flow-through

This is written in

- They do it that way
so you can't read it.

- Well, I did read it
and I'm canceling the contract.

What—whatever,
I'm not accepting the shipment.

50
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:55,960
- Jake, piece of advice:
just give up.

51
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,832
It's the Boyle way.
It's why our family crest

your shipment's downstairs.
- Great.

Whatever gets you onboard.

Let's go.
- For the honeymoon

61

- All right.

- You look dope.
- You won't be abusing

00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:03,207
They're pretty scary.
I mean, no one's seen

175
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:04,861
the CEO's wife in years.

176
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,297
People think
she's been murdered.

177
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,647
- That's just a rumor.
All right, here's the plan:

178
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,952
we infiltrate
their headquarters

179
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,214
and get their
financial records.

180
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:12,042
But how do we get in, you ask?

181
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:14,088
By attending today's meeting
of President's Club

182
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,742
Admiral Level NutriMasters

183
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,221
at the NutriTower Life Base.
- I don't know,

184
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,788
they know we're cops,
we can't just walk in.

185
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:20,268
- Correct.
We can't walk right in,

186
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,052
but we know someone
who's a high-level

187
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:23,576
NutriBoom distributor who can.

188
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:25,229
And he look exactly like you.

189
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:26,796
- Hey, guys.
- I don't know.

190
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,971
You really think
it'll work?

191
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:29,233
- Charles, it has to.

192
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:31,714
It's for our honeymoon.

193
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,629
You said "our."

194
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:36,545
- Okay, the meeting

195
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:37,633
at NutriBoom HQ
starts in two hours.

196
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:39,287
Charles, you're going as Bill

197
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,941
and I'm going as one of
your NutriCruits.

198
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,377
Bill, did you bring
those things I asked for?

199
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,378
- Yep, all of my belongings
that you'll need

200
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:45,032
are in this suitcase.

201
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:49,123
Is your cell phone in here?

202
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,211
- No.
I'm sure

203
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:51,604
it's not a sex toy.

204
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,127
All right, these people
really know Bill,

205
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,476
so you're gonna have to
become him.

206
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,043
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

207
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:57,522
but Bill, tell us all
about yourself.

208
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:00,308
- Let's start with
my whole family history.

209
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,136
I was abandoned
at a playground as an infant.

210
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:03,703
And here I am.

211
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:05,313
- Oh. That was the whole thing.

212
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:07,315
Well, sad. But easier
than remembering

213
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:08,316
a bunch of names.

214
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,709
Okay, tell us more.

215
00:07:09,752 --> 00:07:11,667
- Now, here's a list of all
the nicknames I go by.

216
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,496
Big Bill, Big Eric, Big Drew,
Big Dave, Super Thick—

217
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:16,367
- Just write them
all down for us.

218
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,587
- And that's why the number
of belly buttons I have is...

219
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,067
- Two.
- One.

220
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,286
- Zero.
both: Ahh.

221
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,679
both: Hello.

222
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,159
both: Hello.

223
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,508
both: Hello.

224
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:29,250
both: Hello.
- Hello.

225
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:30,338
- That's it.
Okay, now let's work

226
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,514
on your wink.

227
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:34,255
Almost. Now think,

228
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:38,694
only you and I know
our naughty little secret.

229
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:40,304
Mmm-hmm.

230
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:42,089
- Okay, I think Boyle's ready.

231
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,220
- That's a no-go, Amigo.

232
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:44,526
If you really wanna
pass as me,

233
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,745
you're gonna need to learn
my patented

234
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:47,485
neck massage technique.

235
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:48,704
- I think I've learned enough.
- Yeah, I don't

236
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:49,705
really see that coming up.

237
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:51,533
Thanks for your help, Bill.

238
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,317
- So how did your
first briefing go, Sergeant?

239
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:55,189
Did you give the squad
a simple goal?

240
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,278
- Mm-hmm. Revamping
the filing system.

241
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:59,323
- Mm, smart.
Sounds very easy.

242
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:00,498
- Mm.
- I assume it's been

243
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:01,630
a success?

244
00:08:01,674 --> 00:08:03,806
Yes. It's been...

245
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,460
all types of successes.

246
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:08,071
Rousing, resounding...

247
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,073
smashing.

248
00:08:10,117 --> 00:08:13,250
- Oh, it's good to hear.
Remember, failure...

249
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,382
is for failures.

250
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:15,600
- Good thing I'm not a failure.

251
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,561
Guys, I lied. My briefing
was a total failure.

252
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:21,302
- But you told Captain Holt
it went great

253
00:08:21,345 --> 00:08:22,477
in such a normal way.

254
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,174
- I'm a terrible manager.

255
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:26,568
I've got this super eager
know-it-all on my squad

256
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:28,570
who keeps derailing
me with all his ideas

257
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:29,789
and I can't get
anything done.

258
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:31,529
- Aww, you got an Amy.

259
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:32,748
- Oh, she's got an Amy.
- It's pretty normal.

260
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,228
- Yeah, she got one of her,
right?

261
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:35,446
Like a pet. Takes one
to know one,

262
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,753
I guess.
- No, he is not an Amy.

263
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:39,450
I am nothing like Gary.

264
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:41,061
- Uhh, first of all,
Gary and Amy

265
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,106
are the exact same name.
- Let me ask you this:

266
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,108
did he already send you
nine follow-up emails

267
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,241
about the briefing?
- No.

268
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:48,808
It was 30.
- You got an Amy.

269
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:51,767
- Guys, I think I would know
if my Gary was an Amy.

270
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:54,422
Hey, Gary. What you reading?
- The new issue

271
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:55,771
of "Stationary Monthly."

272
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:58,339
- Yeah, I have an Amy.

273
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:03,779
- Yes, it's me, Bill. Hello.

274
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:05,346
- You seem different.
- Nope.

275
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:06,739
I'm still the same old
Bill Hummertrout

276
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:08,784
who grew up in Bean Station,
Tennessee

277
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,394
and shaves his armpits.

278
00:09:10,438 --> 00:09:11,831
Anyway, meet the new recruit
I signed up.

279
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:13,484
Boom, boom!

280
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,399
- Boom, boom. My name
is Barry St. Barry.

281
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:18,272
And I can't wait to get inside
and unlock my NutriFuture.

282
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,664
Let me—let me in! Let me in!

283
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:21,144
I love your energy. Boom, boom!

284
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:23,581
- I love your energy.
Boom, boom!

285
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,149
- Okay, get up there.

286
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:28,369
- Man, everybody here
is so creepy.

287
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,893
- Yeah. Is that
Hitchcock and Scully?

288
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,374
- Boom, boom, Bill!
- Boom, boom!

289
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:34,549
- Yeah, that tracks.

290
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:36,290
All right, let's get a move on.

291
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,639
The longer I stay here,
the more horrified I get.

292
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:38,901
- I know. Have you seen
all these posters

293
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,208
of David Stovelman's wife,
Debby?

294
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,210
- "I'm happy healthy
and alive."

295
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:45,342
Oh, Debbie dead.
- Debbie real dead.

296
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,691
All right, Bill said that
the offices

297
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,171
are behind that roped-off area.

298
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:49,694
We're gonna
need a distraction.

299
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,435
- Well, if I know cults,
this meeting will start

300
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,481
with an insanely over-the-top
nonsense video.

301
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:54,874
- Huh.
- Hello, Admirals.

302
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,658
Please turn your eyes
to the monitors

303
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:58,442
for a special hello
from NutriBoom elite,

304
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,443
Jay Chandrasekhar.

305
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:01,358
- Boom, boom, everybody!

306
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:03,360
all: Boom, boom, Jay!

307
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:04,666
- And there's our distraction.
- When I first met

308
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:06,407
Docter David Stovelman,

309
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,888
I had no idea my amino acids
could be so high

310
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:11,325
or so low.

311
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,848
- Ugh, guys.

312
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,894
Gary is killing
my productivity.

313
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:17,505
Terry, how did you used to deal
with having an Amy?

314
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:19,681
- I didn't have to do anything.
You've always been great.

315
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:21,422
- Cut the crap, Terry.
I'm drowning.

316
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:23,511
- Fine. When you got
too difficult to deal with,

317
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:24,860
I'd pull rank.

318
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:27,254
- No. Not even once.

319
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:28,777
- Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

320
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,213
- Well, you could always
just wait for Gary

321
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:31,824
to find his Jake
and then eventually,

322
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:33,869
over time, they'll each become
10% easier to deal with.

323
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:35,392
- Gary will never find love.

324
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,785
He is unlovable.

325
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,439
Gina, what do I do?
- No, I don't know

326
00:10:38,482 --> 00:10:39,962
how to deal with an Amy.

327
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,965
But there is this girl Wanda
in my Mommy & Me class.

328
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,881
She's such a pill.
She's so into her baby

329
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,883
and not into the other babies
and it's like,

330
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,363
oh, cool, well, congrats.

331
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:50,712
Your baby rolled over early.

332
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:52,366
Like, who cares?
- I don't have time

333
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,716
for this, Gina,
- And that is how

334
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,370
you deal with an Amy.

335
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:57,980
You talk about something
she's not interested in

336
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,766
until she walks away.
- Ohh, brilliant.

337
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,638
Stupid cult.

338
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:05,858
They labeled their financial
records "financial records."

339
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:08,469
Dummies.

340
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:10,253
Uh-oh, Jake.
We got a NutriBoomer

341
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:11,602
approaching at 12:00.

342
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:12,995
- The file just started
downloading.

343
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,475
How much time do we have?
- I don't know,

344
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:15,476
but he's a polka dotter.
- Polka Dotter—

345
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,694
what does that mean?

346
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:18,218
- Of the eight types of
walkers?

347
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,567
Polka dotters, drivers,
arm swingers,

348
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,916
stompers—
you don't know about this?

349
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,309
- Nobody does, Charles.
You clearly

350
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:23,397
just read
some weird blog post.

351
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,398
- First of all, Popmango.com

352
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,399
is not a weird blog.

353
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:26,443
It's infotainment.

354
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:27,749
Secondly, polka dot walkers

355
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:29,533
take short strides
on their toes.

356
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:30,795
- I don't wanna learn
about polka dotters right now.

357
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:31,796
Just get out there
and stall him.

358
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,797
- But—gah!

359
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:34,538
Hello, bud. Boom, boom.

360
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:36,236
- Boom, boom. Bill.

361
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,454
What are you doing back here?

362
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:38,934
This floor's closed
on the weekend.

363
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,805
- You know me,
just gotta stretch my legs.

364
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:42,459
I'm really sore
from Pilates.

365
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,939
- But NutriBoom doesn't
allow Pilates.

366
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,636
It's a pseudoscience.

367
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,726
- Right, no. Pilates
is the name of my

368
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,424
most recent sexual partner.

369
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:51,555
Boom, boom!

370
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,427
- Boom, boom.
You seem off, man.

371
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,342
Your voice is different,
you're not sucking on

372
00:11:55,385 --> 00:11:57,648
your signature lollipop.
- Right.

373
00:11:57,692 --> 00:11:59,912
I guess I just woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

374
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,435
- Since when do you
sleep in a bed?

375
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:02,653
Why are you being so weird?

376
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:04,481
What are you doing back here?

377
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,266
- I know what's going on.

378
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,485
You're fishing for one of
my patented neck massages,

379
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:10,313
aren't you?

380
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:12,576
- There's the Bill I know.
- Present and accounted for.

381
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,884
Now turn around
and gimme me that neck.

382
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:18,843
- You're not gonna
do it from the front?

383
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:21,934
- Well, of course. I mean,
that's how I do it.

384
00:12:24,414 --> 00:12:26,982
- Oh, that's the good stuff.
Boom, boom.

385
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:28,375
- Boom, boom.

386
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,812
♪

387
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,426
- I got the files.

388
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,993
I told you it would work.

389
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:41,692
Wait, what's wrong?
- They formed a line, Jake.

390
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:43,607
They formed a line.

391
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,611
- Ugh, no evidence
of wrongdoing

392
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:48,961
in any of these files.

393
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:50,266
Credit where credit is due,

394
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,876
NutriBoom is good
at criminal activity.

395
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,748
- Well, they're terrible
at making shakes.

396
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,271
The only
listed ingredient

397
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,882
is "foreign substance."
- And the flavor is called

398
00:12:57,926 --> 00:12:59,710
"Almost Cherry."

399
00:12:59,754 --> 00:13:01,277
And I can't stop drinking it.

400
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,279
- This is interesting.
There's a major transaction

401
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:04,933
on June 10th.
- My dad's birthday!

402
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:06,282
- You really think
that's what I thought

403
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,936
was interesting about it?
- I don't know.

404
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,807
- It's a payment for
100 grand to ScepterCore.

405
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,809
- Isn't that one of
those black ops security firms

406
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:13,420
that ex
- Yes, it is.

407
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:15,117
And on June 10th—
- My dad's birthday.

408
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,292
- Are you just trying to get me
to remember

409
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,077
your dad's birthday now?
- I mean,

410
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,078
it wouldn't kill you to call.
- We don't have time

411
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,427
to talk about this.

412
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,124
Your dad's birthday
is the same day

413
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,386
that Debbie Stovelman
went missing last year.

414
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,040
I bet the payment
is a paper trail

415
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:27,129
for the hit Stovelman
took out on his wife.

416
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,870
This just became a murder case.

417
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:30,872
- Maybe, but it's not enough
to open an investigation.

418
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:32,917
- Right, but it is enough
to make Stovelman nervous.

419
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:34,832
We just have to get to him.
- Oh, no.

420
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,182
Do I have to go
as Bill again?

421
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,400
- No, don't worry.
He isn't big enough

422
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:39,054
to earn face time
with the founder.

423
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:41,143
We have to take this
to the highest level.

424
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,972
both: Jay Chandrasekhar!

425
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:45,408
- Hey, Gina.
Thanks for nothin'!

426
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:47,715
- Oh, you're welcome.
- I said, for nothin'.

427
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,978
Your boring story didn't work.

428
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:53,068
So my friend Wanda,
she just loves the oceans.

429
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,984
The Pacific, the Atlantic,
the Indian—

430
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:58,987
- Ooh, ooh! What is her take
on straits?

431
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,902
Because I love the Bering.

432
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:03,252
- We talked about
bodies of water for hours.

433
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:06,038
- Damn, the Force is strong
with this Amy.

434
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:07,256
- Look, I wasn't
gonna tell you this,

435
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,997
but you should just do
what I used to do

436
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,694
when I needed to escape you.

437
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:12,348
- Literally escape you.
Always be on the move.

438
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:13,871
Never be static.
Like a shark.

439
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,134
That way he can't
catch your attention.

440
00:14:15,177 --> 00:14:17,353
- That's right!
That is what we did.

441
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:19,094
- Mm-hmm.

442
00:14:19,138 --> 00:14:21,096
Okay, but Rosa,
how did you—

443
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,012
Rosa? W-where did she—

444
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:27,233
Damn, you guys are good.

445
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:29,191
- There he is. How did you know
he'd be at this coffee shop?

446
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,498
- "US Weekly." He's pictured
here all the time.

447
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,065
- He's coming out.
All right, look,

448
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:34,240
this guy is into NutriBoom
pretty deep.

449
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:35,328
But if we apply
enough pressure,

450
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:36,416
we may get him to crack.

451
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,504
- Copy that.

452
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:39,027
Hi, excuse me.

453
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:40,507
Mr. Chandrasekhar,
we wanted to talk to you

454
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,117
about NutriBoom.
- All right!

455
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:44,076
Boom, boom, guys.
both: Boom, boom!

456
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:46,165
- We're with the NYPD.

457
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,731
You guys have to save me.

458
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,037
Can you get me out?

459
00:14:49,081 --> 00:14:50,212
- NutriBoom is
a scam and a cult.

460
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,387
They've ruined my life.

461
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:52,997
You look so happy
in the videos.

462
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,173
- You'd pretend to be
happy too

463
00:14:54,216 --> 00:14:55,391
if you knew what
they did to me.

464
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:56,740
- Yeah.

465
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:58,133
Ohh.
- Look,

466
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,482
we have reason to believe
David Stovelman

467
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:00,875
murdered his wife, Debbie.

468
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:02,137
- Yeah, duh!
- All right, Jay.

469
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:03,791
Try to remain calm, here.
- Sorry.

470
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,140
I'm just so scarred.
- Right,

471
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:06,750
from the nard torture.

472
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,317
Look, we have evidence
that could tie David

473
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,102
to his wife's death,
but we need your help

474
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:11,103
to get to him.
- Yeah, I'll do

475
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:12,408
whatever you want.

476
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:13,975
You have no idea
how terrible they are.

477
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:15,411
- Trust me, I do.
They took ten grand from me.

478
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,152
- Boo-hoo,
they kidnapped my dog.

479
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,849
- Okay, well, no need
to compare stakes.

480
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:20,460
Although I doubt your dog
cost $10,000.

481
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,114
- You can't put
a price on life.

482
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:23,115
- You're absolutely right.
Thank you so much

483
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:24,942
for your help, sir.

484
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,161
- Aah!

485
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:27,249
- I need to tell you something.

486
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,946
- Great. Can't wait to hear it.

487
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,426
First, could you pass
that thing over there?

488
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,126
- Sure, yes.
Oh, what thing? I don't—

489
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,431
Sergeant?

490
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,564
Sergeant!
- Oh, hey.

491
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:45,224
Sergeant?

492
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,230
Okay.

493
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:55,451
Let's finally get
these shelves up.

494
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,932
Goes perfect.

495
00:15:57,975 --> 00:15:59,977
Ohh! Oh, no.

496
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:01,979
- Oh, there you are.

497
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:04,199
I was trying to tell you
not to use that wall.

498
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,941
It has water damage.

499
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:08,551
- Noted.

500
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:11,424
- So Stovelman will pick up Jay
and take him to lunch.

501
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,208
We trail them, and then
when they get comfortable,

502
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,123
ambush 'em with the intel
about his wife.

503
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,821
- Wow. I can't believe we're
working a sting operation

504
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:19,214
with a celebrity.
- I know.

505
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,476
I feel like we're in
"Oceans 11."

506
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,999
- You're such a Clooney.

507
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,479
Ooh, and I'm Elliot Gould.
- Wow.

508
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:26,265
Just skipped right over
Pitt and Damon, huh?

509
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,962
- I've been good!
- Oh, no!

510
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,007
Those are NutriCore guys.
- They're taking Jay!

511
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:32,358
It's not a pick up.
It's a throw in.

512
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:33,924
- Hey, Bill.

513
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,317
Boom, boom!
- No boom, boom.

514
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,450
I am not Bill.
- Look, we're with the NYPD.

515
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:40,148
We saw two NutriCore thugs
kidnap Jay and bring him here.

516
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,150
Now where is he?
- Bill, you're a cop!

517
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:44,196
- No, I am not Bill!
- If you don't cooperate,

518
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,023
we'll consider you an accessory
to this crime.

519
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,286
- I don't know what
you mean by crime.

520
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:48,591
Jay's just voluntarily
hanging out with

521
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,463
some nutrition
specialists in the basement.

522
00:16:50,506 --> 00:16:52,247
You can see for yourself if
you'd like, Bill.

523
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,901
- I will see for myself,
but I am not Bill.

524
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:55,207
- Good one, Bill.
- Oh!

525
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,599
- Get out of here.

526
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:59,428
- Jay! Oh, my God.
- Boom, boom, guys!

527
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:01,343
We saw them take you.
Are you okay?

528
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:05,391
Oh, the van thing?
- Yeah, Jay. The van thing.

529
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:07,131
- Those are just my friends
from NutriBoom.

530
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:08,916
They were worried about
my amino acid levels,

531
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,526
so they rushed me straight here
to give me more

532
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,962
or less of them.
- Why are you

533
00:17:12,006 --> 00:17:12,963
talking like that?

534
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:14,269
What did they do to you?

535
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:15,314
- Oh, I see.

536
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:16,315
They gave you back your dog.

537
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,230
- No, they found my dog.

538
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:20,188
He was wandering around a park
for a year.

539
00:17:20,232 --> 00:17:22,103
- Come on, man.
Pull it together.

540
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:23,409
These people are evil,
remember?

541
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,149
David Stovelman
murdered his wife.

542
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:29,415
both: Debbie Stovelman.
- Boom, boom.

543
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,982
- She is happy,
healthy and alive.

544
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,726
- Hey, Captain.
Just wanted to say

545
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,206
sorry about
the hole in the wall.

546
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,642
I've already called
maintenance.

547
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:40,904
- God, you're good.

548
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:42,471
You saw right through me.

549
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,256
I failed as a manager.
I couldn't deal

550
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,954
with this overeager officer
who kept pestering me.

551
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:48,738
- Ohh, you have an—
both: Amy.

552
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:50,914
- Yes, I know. We've been
through it a lot today.

553
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,525
- Well, you should've
come to me.

554
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:53,787
I know exactly what it's like
to be you.

555
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,356
- No, I never had your level
of insecurity.

556
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,966
I was referring to
managing an Amy.

557
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:00,707
- Of course.
Well, I'm not sure

558
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,838
there's anything left to try.

559
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:03,318
No matter what I did,

560
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:04,798
he just kept interrupting me

561
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,365
with all his own ideas.

562
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:07,583
- I don't know.

563
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:09,324
I didn't listen to them.

564
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:10,586
Damn.

565
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,935
Did you just solve it
that easily?

566
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:13,720
- Yes, I did. You see,
managing Amy

567
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:15,635
is not a chore,
it's a pleasure.

568
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,985
Because an Amy is a tool.

569
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:19,639
- Yes, you're a massive tool.

570
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,380
You're useful and valuable.

571
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:23,817
Sure, an Amy can be
intimidating sometimes

572
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,558
because they have
such strong ideas.

573
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:27,690
But you should always listen
to an Amy

574
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:29,823
because they will only
make you better.

575
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:34,001
At least, that's my experience.

576
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:36,525
- Thank you, sir.

577
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:38,048
- Jay, would you
please excuse us.

578
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:39,789
I believe there's
a brand new motorcycle

579
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,269
with your name on it upstairs.

580
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:42,836
- You guys are the best.

581
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,577
- Thanks for bringing
my dog back.

582
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,274
He looks almost
exactly the same.

583
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:48,276
- Come on.
- Boom, boom, Jake.

584
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,930
Boom, boom, Charles.
- Boom, boom, Jay.

585
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:52,498
I thought you were murdered.

586
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,803
- I was never dead.
- Then what was

587
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,631
that 100k payment
to ScepterCore for?

588
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:57,546
- It was to get you
off the grid.

589
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,374
Because the Feds were
investigating you.

590
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:01,289
- You can't indict someone
who doesn't exist.

591
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,551
- So you're still working
for NutriBoom?

592
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:05,380
I am NutriBoom.

593
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:08,340
Look, your annoying little
crusade is wasting my time.

594
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:10,559
I want you to leave me
and my company alone.

595
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:12,431
- Not gonna happen.
Now we know you're alive

596
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:13,736
and I bet the Feds
would be interested

597
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,781
in knowing that, too.
- Maybe,

598
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:15,956
but the fact remains,

599
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,479
I haven't committed
any crimes...

600
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,741
that anyone can prove.

601
00:19:18,785 --> 00:19:20,569
So you can try
your luck with the Feds.

602
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:21,918
Or you can get
your money back and go on

603
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:23,398
that expensive honeymoon.

604
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:24,704
- How do you know
about my honeymoon?

605
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,532
- I know everything.

606
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:30,579
Because you don't know about
my big ass moral compass.

607
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:33,103
- Damn!

608
00:19:33,147 --> 00:19:37,412
- I'm going to the Feds,
and you're going down.

609
00:19:37,456 --> 00:19:38,805
Also, can you tell us
how to get out of here?

610
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:41,111
This place is a real maze.

611
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:43,679
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

612
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:44,941
- Of course.
Nothing I like more

613
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:46,378
than one-on-one time
with my boss.

614
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:47,988
- Wow, it's like
staring in a mirror.

615
00:19:49,468 --> 00:19:51,121
Listen, I wanna apologize.

616
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:54,473
I ignored your ideas
and that was a mistake.

617
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:56,083
Please, tell me
your suggestions

618
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,519
for the filing system.
- It's actually

619
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,869
five suggestions
and 23 sub suggestions.

620
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:01,697
And I—
- After the briefing.

621
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:04,483
- Ohh. Copy that.

622
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:06,006
- All right, listen up, squad.

623
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,703
We had increased
criminal activity

624
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:09,009
in the park last night,
so we'll be

625
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,663
doubling our patrols
there today.

626
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:14,057
After the meeting,
I will be handing out new...

627
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,109
assignments.

628
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:24,677
Oh, my God, I did it.

629
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,156
- The Feds said our intel
could help them

630
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,767
maybe take down Stovelman
someday,

631
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,073
but they didn't sound hopeful.
- Well, I'm glad

632
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:31,510
you did the right thing.

633
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:32,989
Even though it means
we now have no money

634
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,556
for a decent honeymoon?
- It's hard not to

635
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,036
say a really corny thing
right now

636
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,864
about how every day's
a honeymoon with you.

637
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:40,127
- Aww. Although, technically,
you did you just say it.

638
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,523
Which is very
embarrassing for you.

639
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:46,002
- Jake, don't freak out.

640
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,483
There's a really creepy guy
spying on us.

641
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:49,876
- Oh, no, no, no.

642
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,573
That's just Phil
from NutraBoom.

643
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,183
He'll be intimidating us
from now on.

644
00:20:53,227 --> 00:20:55,925
There's an evil corporation
hell-bent on destroying us.

645
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:58,450
Hi, Phil! Boom, boom!

646
00:20:58,493 --> 00:20:59,799
Say, "Boom, boom," darling.

647
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,017
- Boom, boom.

648
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:05,061
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
