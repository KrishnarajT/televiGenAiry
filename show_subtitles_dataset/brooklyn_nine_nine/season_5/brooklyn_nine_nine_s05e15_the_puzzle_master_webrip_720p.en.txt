1
00:00:00,822 --> 00:00:02,127
- Santiago, your test results

2
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:03,215
from the sergeant's
exam have arrived.

3
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:05,000
- Ooh, everybody make room.

4
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,132
Amy needs adequate space
to do her signature dork dance.

5
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:08,786
- I don't know if there's
going to be a dork dance.

6
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,266
I mean, look how small
that envelope is.

7
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:11,789
That's not a big,
good news envelope.

8
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,399
That's a little,
bad news envelope.

9
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:15,575
That's nuts.
Sarge, tell her envelope size

10
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,403
doesn't matter.
- If I'm being honest,

11
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:19,057
I got a much bigger envelope.
- Oh, God.

12
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:20,319
- Unhelpful, Terry.
Very unhelpful.

13
00:00:20,363 --> 00:00:21,886
- Mine was bigger, too.
- Okay.

14
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,105
I just won't ever open it.

15
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,410
That way,
I'll never get rejected.

16
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,064
- Fine, I'll open it.
- No!

17
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:27,239
- Oh, whoa!

18
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:28,284
- Do it harder.

19
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:29,807
- I opened it.

20
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,070
You passed.
Oh, my God.

21
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,376
I'm going to be a sergeant.

22
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:34,507
- You're going
to be a sergeant!

23
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,161
- Yes!

24
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:38,424
♪ Oh, no, it's happening.

25
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:40,252
Whoo!

26
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:43,038
, yeah!
- That's my future wife!

27
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,561
So...

28
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:54,789
♪

29
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:07,540
Amy Santiago,
put down that melon,

30
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,847
for you are about
to feast your eyes

31
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:12,937
on one of the most delicious
cases in the NYPD.

32
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:14,852
I don't like the
personality I've chosen here.

33
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:16,549
- I do. You sound like
Caesar Flickerman

34
00:01:16,593 --> 00:01:18,943
welcoming new "Hunger Games"
tributes to the Quarter Quell.

35
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:20,292
- In one week,

36
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:21,641
you will officially
become a sergeant.

37
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:22,991
Which means this case
will be the last one

38
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:24,122
we ever work together
as detectives,

39
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,428
so it has to be perfect.

40
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,605
I present to you
a serial arson case.

41
00:01:28,648 --> 00:01:30,563
- Mm-hmm.
- And the fires seem to be

42
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:33,218
connected to the
Saturday crossword puzzle.

43
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:34,437
- Mama like.
- Two different buildings,

44
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,917
two consecutive Saturdays,

45
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,396
and a puzzle left
at each crime scene,

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,659
and a note was sent
to the puzzle's author,

47
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:43,272
Mr. Melvin Stermley.

48
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,317
He's the best in the game!

49
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:47,276
He made a puzzle once
where all the answers

50
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,495
were just the word "puzzle"
in different languages.

51
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:53,499
In Estonian, it was moistatus.
- Yeah, well, your moistatus

52
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:55,327
is about to be hecka moist—

53
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:57,025
don't call HR,
we are getting married—

54
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,504
because Melvin Stermley
is coming in

55
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:01,594
to help us with the case!
- Sha-wing!

56
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:04,293
- Hey, I was going through your
calendar for some reason.

57
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:06,686
- It's your job.
- Right.

58
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,559
Anyhoobs, I wanted to remind
you about the commissioner

59
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,083
candidate meet and greet,
and your presentation

60
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:13,519
to the selection committee.

61
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:15,086
Being that I am
your campaign manager—

62
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,696
- You are not.
- I did a little sleuthing

63
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,090
on your rivals.
You want me to spill the beans?

64
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:21,005
- Why would you ever
intentionally spill beans?

65
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,399
They're one of nature's most
densely packed protein sources,

66
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:26,097
and they remain
unsullied by flavor.

67
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:28,056
- Okay, forget it,
I'll just mosey on out.

68
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,101
- Fine, fine,
tell me everything.

69
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:32,930
- All right, have a seat.
It's Gina time.

70
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:35,019
Say hello to your compe-tish.

71
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:38,936
Bryan McCann, John Kelly,
and John Kelly.

72
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,460
Yes, that's right,
there are two John Kellys.

73
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:43,419
- How are these
not the same man?

74
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:46,335
- You should see their wives.
Or should I say, wife.

75
00:02:46,378 --> 00:02:48,293
- Good God, do you know what
their speeches are about?

76
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:49,599
- I do.

77
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:51,253
"Staying the course."

78
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,732
"Maintaining the course," and

79
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:55,083
"Blazing a path
to a new future."

80
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:57,041
I'm kidding, it's
"Remaining on the course."

81
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:58,390
- Unbelievable,
none of these men

82
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:00,566
have any interest
in advancing the NYPD.

83
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,394
- That's right,
because they're dinosaurs.

84
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,222
But do you know
what kills dinosaurs?

85
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,310
- No.

86
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:07,051
You-steroids.

87
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:10,228
You are going
to kill these dinosaurs.

88
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:13,014
- Hey, hey dum-dum.
What are you thinking?

89
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,711
Introducing Amy
to her celebrity crush?

90
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:16,582
Are you insane?
- Relax, Charles.

91
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:18,584
It's not a crush, it's her
nerdy crossword puzzling hero.

92
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,238
I mean, the guy's
got to be a massive dork.

93
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:22,110
His name is Melvin Stermley,
for God's sake.

94
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:24,590
- Jake, he's here.
Come meet Melvin.

95
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:27,724
- Hey, you can call me Vin.

96
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,774
- Whoa, is this
a new detective car?

97
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:36,776
- It sure is,
I put in the paperwork

98
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,128
18 months ago, and got lucky.
They fast tracked it!

99
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:44,088
Say hello to the Nine-Nine's
brand new, fully loaded,

100
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,395
sweet-as-hell
crime-crusher on wheels!

101
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:48,005
- Holy crap, it has
a heads-up display

102
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,094
with built-in
license plate reader.

103
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:51,791
- Who cares.
It's got two burrito holders.

104
00:03:51,835 --> 00:03:53,271
- Those are
cup holders, Scully.

105
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,403
Then what am I supposed

106
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:56,144
to use my thighs for, genius?

107
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:58,059
- Wait, who are you assigning
this car to, Sarge?

108
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:00,104
- Um, I was actually thinking
I'd get this one.

109
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:01,714
- You suck.

110
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,629
- Whoa, the heater
in my detective car

111
00:04:03,673 --> 00:04:06,154
hasn't worked in two years.
I don't have enough body fat

112
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:07,590
to keep warm,
Terry's sick of shivering.

113
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,287
- Okay, just seems
a little selfish

114
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,549
to keep it for yourself
when your detectives,

115
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:12,073
who you took
an oath to protect,

116
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:13,683
are stuck driving
their crappy old cars.

117
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:16,251
- Mine's the oldest.
- I've never felt so abandoned.

118
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:18,644
And I was actually abandoned.
They found me in a swamp.

119
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:20,777
- Fine.
We'll do a drawing for it.

120
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,692
But until then,
no one touches it.

121
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:24,259
- Oops, too late.

122
00:04:24,302 --> 00:04:26,130
I left a ranch handprint
on the windshield.

123
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:27,566
- Okay,
so here are your puzzles

124
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,307
from the days
the arsonist set the fire.

125
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:31,135
- This is really good,
Amy, thanks.

126
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:34,138
- Hey, so Vin, just curious.
Would you say you have

127
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:36,140
the typical physique
of a puzzle maker, or?

128
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,794
- Well, each puzzle only pays
a couple hundred bucks,

129
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,361
so I mostly
make my money modeling.

130
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,189
Primarily swimwear.
- Yeah, I hear that.

131
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:42,494
I could do that too, but I
make pretty good money here,

132
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:44,061
so I don't really need to.

133
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:45,628
Anyways, let's
talk about the case.

134
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:48,109
- So here's the letter that
the arsonist sent to Vin.

135
00:04:48,152 --> 00:04:51,068
"Your clues I discombobulate
to teach you to conjugate,

136
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:54,158
the fool who fails to validate
will watch as I conflagrate."

137
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,291
- It seems like he's using my
crossword to tell me something.

138
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:59,555
- Oh, maybe we should look
at anagrams of the answers.

139
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,644
- That's really good,
"o nasty amiga!"

140
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:05,561
- He re-arranged the letters
of "Amy Santiago."

141
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:08,564
He anagrammed me!
Vin, do Jake Peralta.

142
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:10,348
- I doubt that's even possible.
- Eat a jerk, pal.

143
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:12,263
- What, no one's
ever said that phrase.

144
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:14,265
- I really think this anagram
approach makes a lot of sense.

145
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:15,614
Let's do it.

146
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:17,225
I'll take even clues,
you take odds.

147
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:20,358
- Great, and I will take
everyone's coffee order.

148
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:22,143
That's equally helpful.
- I don't drink coffee.

149
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:24,449
But I'd love a kombucha.
- Great, I'll just...

150
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,147
walk to the kombucha store.

151
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,367
- Yeah, of course.

152
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,195
You can't wear
a coat over a tank,

153
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,806
You're not Ryan Gosling.

154
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,852
- No, not at all.
I mean, I am a little surprised

155
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:38,246
that somebody named Melvin
is so bodacious,

156
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,378
but I feel that jealousy
is an ugly emotion.

157
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:41,771
- That you are feeling.
- And I'm just glad

158
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:43,381
that Amy is spending
some time with her hero.

159
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,817
- Who is super hot.
- Charles, let it go.

160
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,210
- And smart.
- I'm serious, stop.

161
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:49,735
- And hilarious.

162
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,607
- Eat a jerk, pal!

163
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,351
Vin, I see
you're still coatless.

164
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:57,830
- I run hot, like a wolf.
- Oh, I see.

165
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,484
- I wonder if
the word "conjugate"

166
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:00,833
in the arsonist's letter
means we should focus on

167
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,488
the verb answers.
- Cool, I love verbs.

168
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:06,012
Second favorite part of speech.
both: After prepositions.

169
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:07,884
, yeah,
words are cool.

170
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:09,668
But maybe we should
switch gears a bit,

171
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:11,583
and get back to some good
old-fashioned police work.

172
00:06:11,627 --> 00:06:13,150
- Well, whoever's setting

173
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:14,804
these fires is clearly trying
to humiliate Vin.

174
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:16,545
You know, make a puzzle
he can't solve.

175
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:18,373
So maybe we should focus
on people that don't like you.

176
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:19,896
- Jake has a point
about motive.

177
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,506
Maybe another puzzler
wants to take you down.

178
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,378
- Well, if you're
looking for a puzzle head,

179
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:25,554
I'm hosting a crossword night
at the Turnkey Bar tonight.

180
00:06:25,597 --> 00:06:27,164
- Oh, I've always
wanted to go there.

181
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,384
That place is
a total puzz-hang.

182
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:31,690
- Ah, gross, all right,
so we'll go undercover,

183
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:33,692
chat some people up, and see
if we can't find our arsonist.

184
00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:35,651
- Good idea.
- Oh, Amy likes my plan.

185
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:39,959
Great, so Vin, why don't we
just get this coat back on you,

186
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:42,440
and I'll help you
get out of the door, here.

187
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:44,834
And we'll see you tonight,
okay, bye!

188
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:47,010
The best.

189
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,751
- Yeah!

190
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:51,188
- Wow, the competition
looks even older in person.

191
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,147
What do you think these
dinosaurs are talking about?

192
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,887
Where to find "Matlock" reruns?

193
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,411
- Be professional, Gina.

194
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:57,890
Like the homecare nurses

195
00:06:57,934 --> 00:06:59,631
who will tuck them
into bed tonight.

196
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:02,547
- Oh, hello, John.
- Raymond.

197
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:03,809
- I just want to say
what an honor it is

198
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:04,984
to be up for the same job

199
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:07,900
as a man with your...
experience.

200
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:10,468
- Thank you.

201
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:12,905
- I paused suggestively
before I said "experience,"

202
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:14,951
so he would know
it wasn't really a compliment.

203
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:17,562
I invented the pause.

204
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:19,912
- Raymond Holt,
I'm Captain Olivia Crawford.

205
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm the new candidate
for commissioner.

206
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,221
- Yeah, I replaced
the other candidate.

207
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:26,441
He retired to spend more time
with his grandchildren.

208
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:28,617
Anyway, I just wanted to say
what a privilege it is

209
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,230
to be up for the same job
as a man with your... tenure.

210
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:36,233
- Oh, damn, she paused, dude.
- In error, I am certain.

211
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:37,626
Olivia, I may be
older than you,

212
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,018
but I am not some dinosaur

213
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:40,759
intent on maintaining
the status quo.

214
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:43,762
For example, I would add
a social media officer

215
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:45,982
to every precinct.
- Interesting.

216
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:48,245
I plan on eliminating
precincts all together.

217
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:50,595
That's not how we do things.

218
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,120
- That's exactly what
both John Kellys said.

219
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:57,080
- Oh no, she's the asteroid.

220
00:07:57,123 --> 00:08:00,039
- And I don't want to say
you're a dinosaur, but...

221
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,867
You're a dinosaur.

222
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,653
- Wow, a whole crowd
full of puzzlers.

223
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,568
Gotta be honest,
I'm a little disappointed

224
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,265
no one's wearing a green suit
covered in question marks.

225
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:10,049
- That guy has
crossword puzzle pants.

226
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:13,139
Does that scratch your itch?
- Very much so, thanks.

227
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:14,271
All right, we should
probably start talking

228
00:08:14,315 --> 00:08:16,055
to people in line.

229
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:17,796
Pardon me there,
fellow puzzler.

230
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,624
What do you think of
Melvin Stermley?

231
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:21,278
- Uh, you mean
my future husband?

232
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,151
- And his face,
body, and brain—and body.

233
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:26,283
Honestly,
Vin makes all other men

234
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:28,154
seem really
stupid and ugly.

235
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:29,547
- Okay, well,
thank you for your

236
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:31,245
very candid and hurtful input.

237
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:33,856
- You must solve
one of Vin's puzzles to enter.

238
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,814
Rearrange the letters
of this phrase

239
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:37,773
to reveal a place in the world.

240
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,734
- Oh, come on, there's no place
with that many letters in it.

241
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:44,649
I mean, most places
are, like, four letters.

242
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:48,000
You know, park, mall, dump—
- United Arab Emirates!

243
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:50,046
- You may enter.

244
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:52,178
- Uh, you must each
answer a puzzle.

245
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:54,093
- Oh... great.

246
00:08:54,137 --> 00:08:56,052
- Unscramble the letters
in this phrase

247
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:58,968
to reveal the name of a film
based on a classic novel.

248
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:01,840
- Okay.
- "Sad anus loser, I go in"

249
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:02,885
- You know,
I feel like these puzzles

250
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:04,321
are actually very pointed.

251
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,062
Forget it, I got this.

252
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:08,064
Uh, A, R, uh...

253
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,110
Puzzle solved.

254
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,025
♪

255
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:19,989
Who's the anus loser now?

256
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:22,296
It's still me.

257
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:25,124
- Okay, one of us
is about to get access

258
00:09:25,168 --> 00:09:28,345
to the best detective car ever,
and everyone else

259
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,347
will go back
to driving junk cars

260
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,001
for the rest
of your junk lives.

261
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:33,829
- Damn, Sarge,
that took a dark turn.

262
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:35,700
- I want seat warmers.
I want them bad.

263
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:37,136
- I need this car too.

264
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,182
I'm sick of riding my
Vespa to work every day.

265
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:41,053
- Well, being on the seat
behind you is no picnic either.

266
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,882
- All right, here it goes.

267
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:47,712
What?

268
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,976
Oh, my God, it says "Terry."
I won!

269
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,631
♪ Terry got a car,
Terry got a car ♪

270
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:54,980
- No way. You cheated.

271
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:56,982
I didn't cheat.

272
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,071
- I bet every slip in there
says Terry.

273
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:02,771
- He filled it
full of fake people.

274
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:05,077
Who the hell is Norm?
- That's Scully's first name.

275
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,905
- Stop being sore losers.

276
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:08,254
I won fair and square.

277
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:09,908
- No, you won
unfair and un-square,

278
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:11,997
and I'm going to prove it.
- And if we can't,

279
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,782
we'll plant it.
- No.

280
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,044
- Charles, I need your help.
What's the best way

281
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:16,785
to dry out a pant leg that's

282
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,700
been soaked in toilet water?
- Wait 28 minutes.

283
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,615
Trust me, that's how long it
takes for toilet pants to dry.

284
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:22,181
- Well, I can't
just be standing around

285
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:24,140
for half an hour while
Amy chats it up with Vin.

286
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:27,404
- Ah, so it's not toilet water.
You're drenched in jealousy.

287
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,406
- I told you before,
jealousy is an ugly emotion

288
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,713
that I don't feel.
Besides, Amy picked my plan

289
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,323
to come here.
Why would I be jealous of Vin?

290
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,282
- Because of his body, and
face, and brain—and body.

291
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:37,936
- Why does everybody
say "body" twice?

292
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,416
Oh, hang on a second.

293
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,113
Somebody's coming
- Vin is on fire tonight.

294
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:43,028
He's phenomenal.
- No wonder the Saturday

295
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:44,987
crossword replaced
Sam with him.

296
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,293
Sam must be pissed.
- I heard the only place

297
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,426
that buys his puzzles now
is "Parade" magazine.

298
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,689
- The hardest clue
he had in his last one

299
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,822
was a five-letter
word for a game

300
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,346
popular in nursing homes.
- Bingo.

301
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,956
I figured out
who the arsonist is.

302
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,958
It's this guy named Sam.
He's a puzzle maker.

303
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:01,656
And Vin took his job.

304
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:02,961
Oh, he's not the arsonist.

305
00:11:03,005 --> 00:11:04,310
He's been out of town
for weeks.

306
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:05,355
And he's one of
my closest friends.

307
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,878
He let me stay on his couch

308
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:08,314
when Anna Kournikova
and I broke up.

309
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:10,447
Well, I mean,
she never won a major, so.

310
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:12,449
All right, fine, if I'm so
wrong, what did you guys find?

311
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:14,059
- Both fires were located

312
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:15,757
at the intersection
of numbered streets.

313
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,323
If you match those
intersections with the same

314
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,456
intersections of the
numbered clues in the puzzles,

315
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,153
you get the letters "MA".

316
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:22,459
- We think the arsonist
is spelling his name.

317
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:23,982
We can build
a puzzle around that,

318
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,767
and catch him
setting his next fire.

319
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,117
- But we have a suspect
with a crystal clear motive.

320
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,685
I think we need to solve this
like cops, not puzzlers.

321
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:32,338
- I hear you, Jake.
But people who make crosswords

322
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:33,949
love hiding their names
in their puzzles.

323
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,429
It's our version
of a self portrait.

324
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:36,952
All right, you know what?

325
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:38,997
Amy, it's your last case,
you decide.

326
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,738
Should we go with
Vin's wacky little plan,

327
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,871
or should we go
with Sam Jepson,

328
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:45,482
my exceptionally solid lead?
- I see where you're

329
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:48,137
coming from, Jake,
but this is Vin's world,

330
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,182
and I think we should
go with his strategy.

331
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,097
Sound good?
- Yeah.

332
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,796
Yeah, sounds great.
- Okay, great.

333
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,233
Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

334
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:59,931
Oh, no, ugly emotion.

335
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:03,935
- Okay, so we think the
arsonist is using the fires

336
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,547
to spell out his name.
The most common third letter

337
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,679
in names that start with "MA"
are L for Malcolm,

338
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,681
X for Max, R for Mark,
and T for Matthew.

339
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:13,162
- Or his name is Sam,
and he's spelling it backwards.

340
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:14,642
- Uh-huh.

341
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:17,079
Let's just stick
with the LXRT plan.

342
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:18,689
- Copy that.
- Vin designed today's puzzle

343
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,517
using only one
of each of those letters.

344
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,127
Isn't that the craziest
thing you've ever seen?

345
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:23,694
- I don't know, I mean,
remember that time

346
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:25,522
we investigated the
disappearance of Mrs. Jackson,

347
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:27,437
and it turned out her
parrot ate her, bones and all?

348
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,439
That was pretty crazy.
- That was crazy.

349
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,136
- Yeah.

350
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,703
- So tonight, we'll stake
out the intersections

351
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:35,184
that correspond to where
the L, X, R, and T are

352
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:37,621
in Vin's puzzle, and hopefully
catch the arsonist in the act.

353
00:12:37,665 --> 00:12:41,059
I'll take the MAT corner,
you take the MAR corner,

354
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:43,540
and we'll have patrolman
take the MAL and MAX.

355
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,324
Cool?
- Yep, very cool.

356
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:47,239
- Okay, great, I'll get
the surveillance equipment.

357
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:49,677
- Shame.

358
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,548
Shame, shame, shame.

359
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,115
I can't believe
you're doing Vin's plan.

360
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:54,551
I'm only doing it

361
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:55,639
because someone else
is going to do my plan.

362
00:12:55,683 --> 00:12:57,075
- You.

363
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,381
- Oh.
- While I'm busy watching

364
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:00,035
nothing happen
on my stupid corner,

365
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,123
you're going to
stake out Sam's apartment.

366
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,428
Then when he sets a fire,

367
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:03,995
Vin is going
to look like a dummy.

368
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,997
- That's right,
use the jealousy, Jake.

369
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,130
It will give you
unimaginable power.

370
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:11,133
- Yes, yes, I can feel it
coursing through my veins.

371
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:12,221
Oh, my hand cramped.
- Oh.

372
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:13,570
- Oh, it's stuck in a claw.

373
00:13:13,614 --> 00:13:15,267
It's a claw now.
- Oh.

374
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:17,748
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

375
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,663
You're snacking?
This is from the guy

376
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:21,491
who told me that
eating finger foods

377
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,188
was the one true
sign of depression?

378
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:24,668
- Then watch me chew, Gina.

379
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:27,105
I'm a creature of the past.
I'm a dinosaur.

380
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:29,630
- No, you are not, you're
the best man for the job.

381
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:31,501
And I think you know what
you have to do to get it.

382
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,156
- Believe in myself
and give a great presentation?

383
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,375
- Not even close.
That's the head

384
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,117
of the committee over there,
gorging on crab cakes.

385
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,728
Just go up to him
and sabotage Olivia.

386
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:42,643
- Um...

387
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:44,166
I don't think I can do that.
- Well, you can't really be

388
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,342
the best commissioner
the NYPD has ever had

389
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:49,171
if you're not the commissioner.

390
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:53,175
- Right.
You're right, I want this.

391
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:56,047
And I will do
good things for the city.

392
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:58,354
- Yes, you will.
Now, get over there,

393
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:02,488
and crap all
over Olivia's ideas.

394
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:05,666
- Patrick, nice to see you.
- Hello, Raymond.

395
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,668
- Mm.

396
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,670
- I've been thinking recently
about how vital

397
00:14:09,713 --> 00:14:12,368
the existence of
precincts is to the NYPD.

398
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:14,675
- Oh, you spoke to Crawford.

399
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:16,764
She's very forward thinking,
isn't she?

400
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:18,679
- I suppose you
could call it that.

401
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:20,463
I mean, I wouldn't, but—

402
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,597
- Ray, you don't need
to worry about her.

403
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,210
Between you and me, we had to
nominate a girl for PR reasons.

404
00:14:28,253 --> 00:14:30,081
There's no way the NYPD

405
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,649
is ready for
a female commissioner.

406
00:14:32,693 --> 00:14:35,130
- Oh.
- Hey.

407
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,740
Grab a crab cake
before we start.

408
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:39,308
Real crab, big chunks.

409
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,400
- Okay, no one saw Sarge
do anything suspicious

410
00:14:44,443 --> 00:14:46,228
on the day of the drawing.
We got nothing.

411
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,795
- Speak for yourself, sister.
We found a smoking gun.

412
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:48,796
Play it, Hitchcock.

413
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,580
- Voila.
- Bah-boom.

414
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:52,234
- What, I don't see anything.
- Focus on the butt.

415
00:14:52,277 --> 00:14:53,888
The butt don't lie.
- He squeezed his cheeks

416
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:57,805
before he opened the slip.
He knew his name was on it.

417
00:14:57,848 --> 00:14:59,676
- It was a pre-emptive
celebration clench.

418
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,896
- I don't know, we need better
proof than a butt clench

419
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:04,333
to take down Terry.

420
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:07,597
I cheated. I wanted that car,
and I took it.

421
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,252
And it's killing me.
I couldn't sleep all night.

422
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:12,210
I just kept
hearing the blinker.

423
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:15,213
You-cheat,
you-cheat, you-cheat.

424
00:15:15,257 --> 00:15:17,476
Here are the keys.
Take the damn car.

425
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,653
Terry doesn't deserve it.

426
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:22,307
- And that is why
I became a cop.

427
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:26,616
- Hey, Charles, nothing's
happening on my MAR corner.

428
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,358
Any movement at Sam's place?
- No, I did, however, see a

429
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,708
cool-looking dude in a ponytail
on a Razor scooter.

430
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:33,579
I have to admit,
I like the look.

431
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,799
- Is it possible I'm wrong,
and Sam is out of town?

432
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:37,671
Vin's plan is actually
kind of smart.

433
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:40,499
- Jake, I have eyes on Sam.
- Yes, suck it, Vin.

434
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,197
My judgment is clear,
and I am a genius.

435
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,502
Charles, I'll be right there.

436
00:15:43,546 --> 00:15:45,287
- But enough
about the crab cakes.

437
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,246
Our first presentation tonight

438
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,292
will be from
the 99th precinct's

439
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:52,163
Captain Raymond Holt.
Raymond?

440
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:57,734
- Let me begin
with a hilarious joke.

441
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:00,258
I'm surprised I was on the
short list for commissioner.

442
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:03,479
After all, I am six feet tall.

443
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:06,612
Actually, what I have to say
tonight is no laughing matter.

444
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:08,745
I was just told by a member
of the selection committee

445
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:10,486
that they have no intention

446
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:12,749
of ever choosing
a woman to run the NYPD.

447
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:14,533
I suppose I should have
been relieved,

448
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:16,971
because Captain Crawford
is a damn qualified candidate.

449
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:18,842
But as someone who has
been denied opportunity

450
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:21,236
because of who I am,

451
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,673
I cannot stand by and watch
it happen to someone else.

452
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,589
So, I will be
reserving my presentation

453
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,809
for a selection committee
that will judge

454
00:16:28,852 --> 00:16:30,767
all of the candidates fairly.

455
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:32,726
And let's be honest.

456
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,815
The crab cakes were only so-so.

457
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:37,339
Thank you.

458
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:39,341
- All right, talk to me,
what's happening?

459
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:41,822
What's Sammy up to?
- Well, he just sat down

460
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:43,911
on the plaza.
- Okay, he's opening up

461
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:47,349
his backpack and pulling out
what appears to be a thermos.

462
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:49,830
Possibly containing some sort
of accelerant-like gasoline.

463
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:51,614
- Yup.
- No, he's eating it

464
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:53,529
with a spoon.
It's soup, he's eating soup.

465
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,618
- Well, maybe he's fueling up
for a night of starting fires.

466
00:16:55,661 --> 00:16:57,446
- He just pulled out a lighter!

467
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,231
Nope, it's not a lighter.
It's a bumblebee PEZ dispenser.

468
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:01,711
- Hmm.
- Ooh, he's making

469
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:03,495
a phone call.
Quick, get the parabolic mic.

470
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,411
- Mom, I did something bad.

471
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:08,239
- Yeah, you set some fires.

472
00:17:08,283 --> 00:17:10,720
- I proposed to Gretchen,
and she said no.

473
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,854
- So you set some fires.
- So, I left Myrtle Beach.

474
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:15,681
- Two weeks ago,
and then you set some fires.

475
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:17,771
- No, I got back home today.

476
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:19,729
Yeah, all my fish were dead.

477
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,035
- Okay, so Sam didn't do it.

478
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:22,558
I should probably
get back to my corner.

479
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:23,820
Just for the record,

480
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:25,343
just because
I was wrong about Sam,

481
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:27,606
does not mean
that Vin was right.

482
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,088
Well, this is disappointing.

483
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,700
- I can't believe
you left your post.

484
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:36,137
What, the plan wasn't yours,

485
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,834
so you didn't think
it was worth following?

486
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:39,836
Well, because of
your juvenile behavior,

487
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,751
one of our city's finest...

488
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,232
abandoned lard factories
is now burned to the ground.

489
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,625
- My gut told me that Sam
Jepson was setting the fires.

490
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,062
Although I now realize
his actual life

491
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:49,846
is much sadder than that
of a serial arsonist.

492
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,674
- But we agreed
to do Vin's plan.

493
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,241
Vin is not a cop.

494
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:54,851
Why do you keep siding
with him instead of me?

495
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:56,592
Oh, let me guess,
because he was right,

496
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:57,898
and the building was on fire,
and he's perfect?

497
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,643
- All right,
I didn't want to say anything

498
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,863
because it's a gross emotion,
but yes, I am a little bit

499
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:09,474
jealous of the
super smart supermodel.

500
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:11,041
This was our
last case together.

501
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:12,956
And you and him have
been joined at the hip.

502
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,045
Or in his case,
that super sexy V muscle

503
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,655
that I don't
understand how to tone.

504
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:18,527
- He told me, it's a
lot of bicycle crunches.

505
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:21,791
That's crazy,
you would just fall right off.

506
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,925
- Babe, you have no reason
to be jealous of him.

507
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:26,883
I just...

508
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,798
I don't want you
to wake up one day

509
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:32,106
and with that you were with
someone as smart as you are.

510
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:33,890
- I am with someone
as smart as I am.

511
00:18:33,934 --> 00:18:34,935
You.

512
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:36,806
You're a brilliant detective.

513
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,634
I love the way you think.

514
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:40,636
That's why I want to marry you.

515
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:44,292
- Marry me.

516
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,642
Marry.
Oh, my God, look.

517
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,905
The arsonist spelled MAR,
but they were going to spell

518
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:51,212
M-A-R-R-Y!
Or...

519
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,822
- Conjugate.
Conjugate means marry!

520
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,563
- Yes, and who
wants to marry Vin?

521
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:56,565
both: The lady from the bar!

522
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,959
Hey, puzzle chick,
unscramble this.

523
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:01,875
You're going to "ailj."

524
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,225
- All right, Sarge.
The car is yours.

525
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,009
Why?

526
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:08,229
I don't deserve that car.
- I don't know about that.

527
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,578
I went back
and watched the tapes

528
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:10,666
to figure out how you did it.

529
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,189
Right before the drawing,

530
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,887
you got a peanut butter cup
out of the freezer.

531
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,845
The thing is, you don't
eat sugar past 4:00 p.m.

532
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,151
- Could have been a cheat day.

533
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,848
- Oh, it was
definitely a cheat day.

534
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:19,980
You froze your slip of paper,

535
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:21,633
so that when
you pulled the name,

536
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,200
all you had to do
was find the cold one.

537
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:24,810
- So.

538
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:25,986
You thought the way I cheated

539
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:27,770
was so cool,
you gave me the car?

540
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:29,293
- Yeah, but also while
I was watching those tapes,

541
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:30,947
I noticed all the nice crap
you do for people.

542
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,340
You got Gina
a cushion for her chair.

543
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,211
You let Charles
show you 130 pictures

544
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:35,865
of Nikolaj brushing his teeth.

545
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,649
You Heimlich'd Scully twice.

546
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,087
On the same peanut.
- I also solved a murder.

547
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,611
- Yeah, we all solve murders,
but you,

548
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:44,352
you let Hitchcock borrow
a pair of your socks,

549
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:46,136
because his
somehow disintegrated.

550
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,964
Anyway, I'm sorry I guilted you
in the first place.

551
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:50,358
You deserve that car.
- Thanks, Diaz.

552
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:53,100
How did you get Hitchcock
and Scully to agree to this?

553
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:55,319
- I washed their car and
told them it was a new one.

554
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:56,668
They're napping
in it right now.

555
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:59,019
- Smart!

556
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:01,760
- Hello, Captain Holt.
- Ah, Captain Crawford.

557
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:03,110
To what do I owe the pleasure?

558
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:04,938
- Captain Crawford
is here to see you.

559
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:07,244
- Thank you, Gina.

560
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:10,595
- So, it would seem that
we have become frenemies.

561
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:13,033
Do you know what that means?
- Are you trying to imply

562
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:14,817
that I'm too old to
understand a portmanteau?

563
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,647
I am not, but I am
too dignified to use one.

564
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,997
Friend-enemy.
- I just wanted to thank you,

565
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,173
for your brave speech.
The mayor's office has replaced

566
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:26,307
the selection committee
with a less biased one, so.

567
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,309
Feel free to start
calling me commissioner now.

568
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,919
- The only time
I plan on calling you

569
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,181
is to hear you concede.

570
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:32,748
- It's going to be
hard to hear anything

571
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,228
once I've crushed you
into a fine powder.

572
00:20:34,271 --> 00:20:37,361
- A fine powder that will
choke you until you die.

573
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:40,190
May the better candidate win.

574
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:41,713
- She will.

575
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:46,762
- Captain Crawford left.

576
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:47,981
- So, we brought her
in this morning,

577
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:49,634
and she confessed immediately.

578
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:52,333
- Hi, Vin, I love you!
Did you see my fires?

579
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,943
- Turned out,
she was writing something.

580
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,164
Specifically, "marry me,
or else I will kill you.

581
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:58,904
Yours forever,
Helen Gorbelson."

582
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:01,820
- Wow, that's so many fires.
- So many fires.

583
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:04,127
- Thank you for catching her.
With a brilliant puzzling mind

584
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:06,086
like yours on the case,
it was only a matter of time.

585
00:21:06,129 --> 00:21:07,652
- Actually, Jake solved it.

586
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:08,740
He's kind of
a genius with this stuff.

587
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,133
- Oh, thank you, then.

588
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:11,265
- Couldn't have done it
without your help.

589
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:13,006
- So I guess that's that.

590
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:14,094
I should probably run
if I'm going to make it

591
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:16,052
to the Javits Center by four.

592
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:18,098
They're making a mold of me for
the upcoming Bodies Exhibit.

593
00:21:18,141 --> 00:21:20,752
- As they should,
your body is great.

594
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,232
And that's okay.
- Thanks, man.

595
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,886
You should join me
for a puzzle night sometime.

596
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:25,322
- Oh.
- No!

597
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,107
Jake is taken.
He already has a friend.

598
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,891
Hang out offer declined.

599
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,762
Now let's strut your
centerfold ass out of here.

600
00:21:30,806 --> 00:21:32,025
- Fremulon.

601
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:34,157
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
