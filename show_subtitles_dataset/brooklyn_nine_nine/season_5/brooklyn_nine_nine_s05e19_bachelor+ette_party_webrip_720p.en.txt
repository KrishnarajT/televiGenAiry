1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,537
Here comes the bachelor,

2
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:06,757
all dressed in my nice jacket
I only wear for special events.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,715
- Oh, you're already on fire.
- Thank you, my friend.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,717
And gentlemen,
welcome to my bachelor party.

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,632
This is the elite party squad.

6
00:00:12,676 --> 00:00:14,591
That is, assuming the captain
is ready to let loose?

7
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,201
I don't think so.

8
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:18,072
I want you guys to think of me
as one of the boys.

9
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:21,249
So tonight I'll be swapping
out my captain's hat for my...

10
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:23,600
Kangol hat.
Call me Raymond.

11
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:25,210
- Okay, Raymond in
the Kangol hat, I will

12
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:26,864
definitely call you Raymond,
Raymond in the Kangol hat.

13
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:28,387
This is the best night
of my life.

14
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:29,432
- Mine too.
Sharon gave me permission

15
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:30,563
to get ♪ wasted.

16
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:31,999
She's even putting a pasta pot

17
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:33,871
next to the bed in case I hurl.
- Smart.

18
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,916
I'm definitely putting a pasta
pot on our wedding registry.

19
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,918
Charles, tell us everything
we're doing tonight.

20
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:39,572
- Well, that could
take a long time.

21
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:41,705
I've been planning this
bachelor party for ten years.

22
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:43,315
- But I met Amy eight years ago.

23
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:44,403
- What does she
have to do with this?

24
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:45,622
JK.
I'm happy for you both.

25
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:48,146
No, no, tonight is about

26
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:50,365
creating a bond
that will last forever.

27
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:52,803
Tonight is about
The Batch Boys.

28
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,282
- Eh, we can
brainstorm the name later.

29
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:56,850
- No, we can't because I already
made fanny packs.

30
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,330
- Ah, well, that settles that.

31
00:00:58,373 --> 00:00:59,592
- This, uh, clearly says
"Bach Boys."

32
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:01,028
- No, it's "batch."

33
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:02,813
You know, like
the beginning of "bachelor."

34
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,205
I've been working on this
for ten years—don't ruin it!

35
00:01:04,249 --> 00:01:06,730
- Okay, so let's fanny up,
Batch Boys,

36
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:08,209
because it's time to party.

37
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:09,428
- Whoop whoop!

38
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:10,690
- Yes.

39
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:12,736
Whoop whoop,
Raymond in the Kangol.

40
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:14,564
Let's go.

41
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,835
♪

42
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,803
- I'm so excited for tonight.

43
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,806
Thank you to my best friend,
Kylie, for organizing this.

44
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,982
And thank you for coming,
ladies

45
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:43,244
and gentlemen.

46
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:44,550
- I still don't get
why you guys are here.

47
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:45,986
- Well, as I understand it, Amy

48
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,597
lost some sort of bet with Jake.
- It's true.

49
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,207
In hindsight,
we should probably stop

50
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,165
making major decisions
through bets and competitions.

51
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,906
- More importantly, why
are you guys dressed like that?

52
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,560
You look like
you're on "Empire."

53
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:56,693
- That's what we were going for.
Drip drop.

54
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,781
- We brought you a little gift.

55
00:01:57,824 --> 00:01:59,260
I had to guess on cup size.

56
00:01:59,304 --> 00:02:00,784
- Just gonna burn that for you.
- Thank you.

57
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:05,658
Tonight, until
the stroke of midnight,

58
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:08,531
I will not make fun of you
in any way at all,

59
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:09,532
no matter what.

60
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:10,663
- That is so sweet.

61
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:12,491
And my gift to you

62
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:15,581
is a cray-cray night
of funky fun!

63
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,453
- I fear I've already made
the biggest mistake of my life.

64
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:20,586
So, Kylie.

65
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,153
What's the first event
of the night?

66
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:24,372
- I thought we'd start
by discussing the etymology

67
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,200
of the word "bachelorette."

68
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:27,550
- Whoo-whoo!

69
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:28,812
- Or we could just play
"Never Have I Ever."

70
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:30,030
- I'll start.

71
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:31,162
Never have I ever

72
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,165
flashed a bartender
to get a free drink.

73
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:36,471
- You guys know how
the game works, right?

74
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:38,343
You drink if you have done it.

75
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:40,171
- Oh.
We understand.

76
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:44,697
- Okay, Batch Boys, the
festivities official begin now.

77
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:46,612
Let's just grab a couple cabs
or—

78
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,006
oh, my God.
What do we have here?

79
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,703
- Damn!

80
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,313
Nice work on the limo, Charles.

81
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:53,663
What—

82
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,664
What just happened?

83
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,317
- Well, that was weird.

84
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,667
A suspicious bag.

85
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,798
Maybe we should
see what's in it?

86
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,191
- Ooh.
- A mystery bag.

87
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:02,193
I hope it's got
those light-up necklaces.

88
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:04,021
People love seeing large groups
of drunk men wearing those.

89
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,240
- Nope.
It's a bunch of school supplies.

90
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:08,678
Is this gonna be one of
those scavenger hunts, Boyle?

91
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,375
'Cause that pasta pot
isn't filling itself.

92
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:12,507
- Come on, Terry.
Let's just see what the plan is.

93
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,726
Charles, what are we doing?

94
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,293
- I don't know
anything about it.

95
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:17,991
But why don't we take
this map and this sextant

96
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:20,341
and chart a course
to the restaurant?

97
00:03:20,385 --> 00:03:21,908
- Title of your sex-tant tape.

98
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,170
- Ah, did not work at all,

99
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:24,607
but I love that
you attempted it.

100
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,738
Title of your sex-tant tape.

101
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:26,913
All right, let's go!

102
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,349
- Never have I ever

103
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:31,483
had sex in the back of a car.

104
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,267
- No way.
Everyone's done that?

105
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,878
- Yeah.
Except for you.

106
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,575
- Kylie, you're telling me you
had sex in the back of a car?

107
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:37,968
- Actually, it was a school bus,

108
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,839
on the way back from Model U.N.

109
00:03:39,883 --> 00:03:41,058
with Myanmar.

110
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,668
- It's like I don't
even know you.

111
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:44,017
- Look, we've done
like nine rounds of this,

112
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,236
and you haven't drunk once.

113
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,454
Maybe we should
play something else

114
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:47,978
that actually gets you drunk.

115
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:49,240
I love you, dude, but you
haven't had the craziest life.

116
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:51,155
- That's not true.
I've done stuff.

117
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:53,331
Just say ones that
are a little less wild.

118
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:56,464
- Uh, never have I ever
made a turn without signaling.

119
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,772
- Okay, a turn is a big deal.

120
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,469
It's not like you said,
never have I ever

121
00:04:01,513 --> 00:04:02,949
changed lanes without signaling.

122
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,691
- Never have I ever
changed lanes without signaling.

123
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:07,562
- You guys are insane!

124
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:09,129
- Never have I ever

125
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:11,479
accepted the terms and
conditions without reading them.

126
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:12,785
- It's too risky.

127
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:14,439
- Left a movie
without watching the credits.

128
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:15,962
- Those people worked hard.

129
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,270
- Used more than the recommended
amount of conditioner.

130
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:22,099
- They make the conditioner.
They know what they're doing.

131
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:23,578
- This is lame.
Let's play something else.

132
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,189
- No.
No-no-no, okay.

133
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:26,538
Never have I ever

134
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:29,062
had a one-night stand
with a guy from a band.

135
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:30,977
Whoops!
Yes, I have!

136
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,502
- Whoa, I am V impressed, Amy.
V impressed.

137
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:35,982
- In fact, Kylie,

138
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,680
it was the lead singer
of your wedding band.

139
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:39,159
Boom!
That's right.

140
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:40,552
I'm a wild girl!

141
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,336
Watch out, Madonna.

142
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:45,209
I told Jake that
you really liked that band

143
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,602
and he booked it for
your wedding as a surprise.

144
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,041
Surprise!

145
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:53,826
- So, according to this map,

146
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,699
the restaurant should be
right here.

147
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:58,526
But it's just an
old abandoned building.

148
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,703
- That's odd.
Unless...

149
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:03,183
You don't think
when the sun sets that

150
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:06,404
certain letters on that graffiti
wall will be illuminated

151
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:07,710
by a shaft of light?

152
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:09,015
- I don't think that.

153
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,408
We've been at
this bachelor party

154
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,453
for over an hour,
wandering around aimlessly

155
00:05:12,497 --> 00:05:15,021
and we haven't done
one bachelor party thing!

156
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,720
- Well, Terry, if you'd like,
I could share a lewd story.

157
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:19,547
Kevin got me quite horny
this morning.

158
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:20,723
Oh, see?

159
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:22,768
- Come on, guys.
I'm hungry!

160
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:24,552
- Oh, you're in luck;
the fanny pack

161
00:05:24,596 --> 00:05:26,119
is filled with granola.

162
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:29,209
- Mmm!
Loose granola.

163
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:31,777
- I don't want fanny granola!

164
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,431
I want steaks and whiskey!

165
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:35,172
Is this whole night
just gonna be puzzles?

166
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,261
- Good question.
Perhaps that's something

167
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,828
the limo can answer!

168
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,220
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, the limo's back!

169
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:42,048
We finally get to
ride in the limo.

170
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,702
Nope. The limo is not for us.
This is something else.

171
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:45,095
- Oh, no, I'm being kidnapped!

172
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:48,881
- We have your friend!
Your mission is to find him!

173
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,754
It is.
Write that down for later.

174
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,538
Oh!
I'll see you in six hours.

175
00:05:54,844 --> 00:05:57,411
Joe, let us
get in the limo, please!

176
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,152
Terry's so hungry!

177
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:00,414
No!

178
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:05,158
- Okay, let's not get
discouraged just because—

179
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:06,594
- We've been doing this
for 93 minutes

180
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:08,422
and we haven't figured out
one damn clue.

181
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:09,946
- That's why I said
to not get discouraged.

182
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:12,513
All right, what about book two?
Maybe it's a code.

183
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:13,906
All we have to do is decipher

184
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,603
this list of thousands
of random numbers.

185
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:18,345
- Huh, I wonder if
one of them is... 6

186
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:19,825
- Pretty sure he means 69,
but I'm so hungry

187
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:21,522
I can't even appreciate
horndog Raymond.

188
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:23,263
- I say we bail
on the scavenger hunt.

189
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:24,961
There's a restaurant
one block away that

190
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,876
rolls meat to you on a cart.

191
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,921
- Charles would be so upset
if we bailed.

192
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,227
- But what if
Charles never knew?

193
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,576
If we can figure out
where he's going to be

194
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,012
at the end of the night,
we don't have to do

195
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:34,840
any of his dumb puzzles.
- Right.

196
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:36,276
Instead, we can spend
the next six hours

197
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,625
eating and drinking and

198
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,584
talking about
how we lost our V cards.

199
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:41,281
- And then we show up
at the final location

200
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:42,935
and pretend we did
the stupid hunt.

201
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:44,763
- Yeah-yeah...
- Interesting.

202
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:46,547
All right, I'm not saying
I'm on board with this

203
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,506
'cause it's a little bit cruel,
but hypothetically,

204
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,116
if we were to cheat—
- Got it.

205
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,465
I hacked his email.

206
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:53,467
His password's
really easy to guess.

207
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,860
"Dianne Wiest."

208
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:56,166
- And look here.

209
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,037
There's a receipt
for a party boat rental

210
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,604
and also a cake delivery

211
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:01,432
to a dock down in Bergen Beach.

212
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,129
That's got to be
where this night ends.

213
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,522
- All right, fine.

214
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,480
We will stop and get
one tiny, little snack

215
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:08,221
just to recharge
our brains and bods,

216
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:10,223
but under no circumstances
will we

217
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:12,965
do any bachelor partying
without Charles.

218
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:14,793
Whoo!
I'm getting married!

219
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:17,274
This is my bachelor party!

220
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:18,536
- You guys, I can't have

221
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,886
some rando one-night stand
at my wedding.

222
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,148
- I'm on the band's website.

223
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,802
Not to tease you, but

224
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:26,500
just so we all have
the complete information.

225
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:28,720
Which one is he?
- Constantine Kane.

226
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,635
- Yes.

227
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:31,810
I see.

228
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:33,246
- Why don't you
just cancel the band?

229
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,682
- If I cancel, I'll have to

230
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:37,076
tell Jake why,
and I don't want to do that.

231
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,209
- Well, it says he's playing
a solo show in Bed-Stuy tonight.

232
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,688
We can just go down there
and ask him

233
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:42,212
to pull out of the wedding.
- I don't know.

234
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,388
Tonight was supposed to be
about us bonding,

235
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,520
and instead, it's just
starting to be about some dude.

236
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:48,653
- No, it's about your
bachelorettes having your back.

237
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:50,002
- But I wanted
tonight to be fun.

238
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:51,177
- And it will be.

239
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,918
We're having
a drunken adventure!

240
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,225
♪

241
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,096
Okay.
Yeah. Let's do it.

242
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,229
- Yay!
Bachelorette adventure!

243
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,579
- Kylie, you should talk less.

244
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,711
Sorry, I have to
direct it somewhere.

245
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:05,191
- Nice to meet you,
by the way.

246
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,584
- Hey guys,
if you're running out,

247
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,194
I'm just gonna
take Hitchcock to the hospital.

248
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:10,718
- He drank a lot during
"Never Have I Ever."

249
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,198
We're gonna
get his stomach pumped,

250
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,244
try to get
ahead of this thing.

251
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:15,680
- That meat was good.

252
00:08:15,723 --> 00:08:17,160
You know what we should order?

253
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:18,378
More meat.

254
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:19,945
- Yeah, we should.

255
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,033
We're "The Steak Studs!"

256
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:22,817
- The Steak Studs!

257
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:23,775
No-no-no—wait!

258
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:25,559
Charles already gave us a name.

259
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,735
And that is the only one
we're gonna use.

260
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:29,694
Steak Studs! Steak Studs!

261
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:31,391
Steak Studs! Steak Studs!

262
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:32,740
- Wait-wait.
- Steak Studs...

263
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:34,090
- It's Charles.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

264
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,091
What do we do?
What do we do?

265
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:36,222
- Everyone, calm down.

266
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,441
It'll be fine.
I have an idea.

267
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:40,531
Why is everyone looking at me?

268
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:42,533
- You just said you had an idea,
then you stopped talking.

269
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:44,448
- Oh, my goodness.
I'm very intoxicated.

270
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,797
- Oh, he's FaceTiming me,
you guys.

271
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,929
What do I do?

272
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:48,191
He can't know
we're at the restaurant.

273
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:49,279
I need a neutral background.

274
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:50,367
- I'm a neutral background!

275
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,282
I'm huge!
- Yes. Genius.

276
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:55,111
- Let me put on my jacket.
Okay.

277
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:56,503
Hey, best man.

278
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:58,549
- Jake!
Oh, I'm so scared.

279
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:01,117
The kidnappers
have me tied up and—

280
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,901
W

281
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:05,208
- I don't want to say, in case
the kidnappers are listening.

282
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:06,992
- Smart.
But please hurry.

283
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:09,342
They're torturing me like
James Bond in "Casino Royale."

284
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:11,954
It's all groin stuff!
Oh, my God.

285
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:14,434
Save me!
Save—

286
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,394
That was close.

287
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,483
So...

288
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,180
should we order another round?

289
00:09:21,224 --> 00:09:23,791
- ♪ And that's why I cry

290
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:27,056
♪ Every time I eat
my pecan pie ♪

291
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:31,974
♪ A la mode

292
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:34,672
- Yeah, Constantine!
- Thank you.

293
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:35,542
Namaste.

294
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:36,804
- Look, in my defense,

295
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:38,415
he didn't used to
have that man bun.

296
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,894
It was just a ponytail.

297
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:41,635
- I'm just gonna
write some of my thoughts down

298
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,637
just to let them out,
so I don't explode.

299
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:47,467
- Okay, look, no matter how lame
that dude's man purse is,

300
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,643
Amy Santiago still
had a one-night stand.

301
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,341
To Amy!
all: Amy!

302
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:52,995
- Yeah.

303
00:09:53,038 --> 00:09:56,911
- Actually, it technically
wasn't just one night.

304
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:57,912
- Explain.

305
00:09:57,956 --> 00:09:59,001
- Well, he caught me

306
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:00,567
trying to sneak out
the next morning,

307
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:02,482
and then he started crying,

308
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:04,049
so I hugged him, and

309
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:05,833
while we were hugging, um,

310
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:08,880
his mom FaceTimed, and he
introduced me as his girlfriend.

311
00:10:08,923 --> 00:10:10,447
- Okay, so then
right after the call,

312
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,622
you broke up with him,
ended it.

313
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:13,537
- Uhh...
- How long were you with

314
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,973
crying wedding

315
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:17,149
- Not that long.
I doubt he even remembers me.

316
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:18,498
- Oh, my God.
Amy Santiago.

317
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,109
Ladies and gentlemen,

318
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,502
the love of my life is here.

319
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:24,504
- Three months.
We dated for three months.

320
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:26,854
All right.
This is the boat.

321
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:29,161
Now, Charles has to think
we're totally sober

322
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:30,467
and we solved his puzzle.

323
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,034
So we good?
- Yep, I'm drunk as hell!

324
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:34,036
- That's not what I asked.
- Don't worry about me.

325
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,038
I've seen you do enough of
these harebrained schemes

326
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:37,082
to know how to play along.

327
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:38,388
If Charles asks what's wrong,

328
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:41,608
I'll just
put on a quaint smile and say,

329
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,349
"Nothing."

330
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,003
- Amazing.
That is actually perfect.

331
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,787
All right, now let's hold on
to each other for balance

332
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:49,051
like three
totally sober grown men.

333
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:51,140
Come here.

334
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,316
And here we go.

335
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:56,188
Oh, yeah, we're nailing this.

336
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:58,756
Hello?
Charles?

337
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,105
[Lionel Richie's
"All Night Long" plays]

338
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,412
- Surprise!
Welcome to the party, pal!

339
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:04,849
- Wow!
This is amazing!

340
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:06,938
- Yeah!
Now we get to the best part.

341
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,200
Steaks and shots!

342
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:10,724
- Ohh, more meat and alcohol.

343
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:12,378
What does that mean?

344
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,164
Uhh...

345
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,079
Nothing?

346
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,043
- Uh-huh.

347
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:27,915
- So there is one question
about the scavenger hunt

348
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,134
you have to answer.

349
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,789
Was he everything
you thought he'd be?

350
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:32,877
- Yes.

351
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,140
He was everything
I thought he'd be.

352
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:38,361
Never before has a person so
perfectly met my expectations.

353
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:39,579
- I know!

354
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:41,538
Isn't Reginald VelJohnson
the best?

355
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,453
From "Die Hard"?

356
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:46,412
Sergeant Powell was
a part of my bachelor party?

357
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,806
Is what I said upon meeting him.

358
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,416
I'm just still
emotional about it.

359
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,592
I can't believe
you pulled that off!

360
00:11:52,636 --> 00:11:54,159
Yeah, I did.

361
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:55,465
I have one more
surprise for you.

362
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,207
If I could have your eyes, ears,

363
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,165
and emotional cores...

364
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:03,560
I'd like to take you all
on a journey.

365
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:05,170
- Wow, you got a lot of
photos of my birth.

366
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,129
- Your mom didn't have any pics,
so I had to call the hospital.

367
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:08,260
- Ah.
- Jake Peralta.

368
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,567
My partner.
My best friend.

369
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,656
My brother.
My idol.

370
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,659
The one man who has never
let me down.

371
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,487
- Oh, that's very kind.

372
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,837
- Tonight had to be the biggest,

373
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,969
most special
bachelor party ever.

374
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:25,234
It had to be
extraordinary because you,

375
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,714
my friend,
are no ordinary man.

376
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:33,198

We just didn't have
the heart to tell you.

That cost $800.

Turtle Bug.

- I feel like
the fact that you just

called me that
means you don't.

If I make fun of Constantine

413
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,052
does that count
as making fun of you?

414
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,358
- Yes.
- Okay.

415
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:48,273
Can I make fun of you?
- I'd rather you didn't.

416
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:50,275
- Well, I have to remove myself
from this situation.

417
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:53,060
- Look, I want to talk to you
about a gig you have coming up.

418
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:54,845
Jake Peralta booked it.
- Yeah.

419
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:56,281
Your wedding.

420
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:58,109
If you knew that,
then why did you take it?

421
00:13:58,152 --> 00:13:59,415
- I wrote you a love song.

422
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,764
I'm gonna sing it,
and I'm gonna win you back.

423
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,635
Then we're gonna be
on "The Today Show."

424
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,942
- I love Hoda.
- Yeah, no.

425
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,117
No, we will not.

426
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,771
This is what's
gonna happen, okay?

427
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,251
You're gonna call Jake,

428
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:10,774
tell him something came up,

429
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,123
and you have to cancel the gig.

430
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,994
- Not happening.
I'm gonna get on that stage.

431
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:15,866
And I'm gonna play
"Amy Come Back."

432
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:17,955
- Fine.
I'm gonna tell Jake everything.

433
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,610
I'm cancelling your band.
Boom.

434
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:23,439
- Okay!
That'll just cost you $15,000.

435
00:14:24,788 --> 00:14:25,963
- Well, when I heard
it was your wedding,

436
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:27,747
I knew your fiancé would cancel

437
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,141
when he found out about us,
so...

438
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:32,448
I put in a huge kill fee.

439
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:35,015
- Yeah, he never even noticed.

440
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:37,714
- He didn't read
the terms and conditions.

441
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:40,325
- Look, Charles,
I'm sorry that we cheated,

442
00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:41,631
but your puzzle was too hard.

443
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,459
- Oh, don't give me that excuse.

444
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:44,764
I worked hard on this night!

445
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,157
And it all led up to this moment

446
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,160
where everyone gives you
$3,200 in gold coins!

447
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:51,336
- Again, is the gold coin thing
based on something I said?

448
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,295
- You're 24 karat gold!

449
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,035
- Yeah, right, okay.
- You guys are the worst.

450
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,211
- You're right, and
we shouldn't have lied to you.

451
00:14:57,255 --> 00:14:58,865
But all of this, the puzzle,

452
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:00,954
it's what you wanted, not me.

453
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:02,739
I just wanted
to hang out with my friends.

454
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:04,828
- Well, don't let me stop you.

455
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,351
You can hang out with
your friends all you want,

456
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:07,483
because I'm leaving.

457
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:08,484
- Charles!

458
00:15:10,355 --> 00:15:11,835
Come on, slideshow.

459
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:16,535
- Boyle isn't picking up,
and I called Genevieve.

460
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:18,407
She doesn't know where he is.
- Wait.

461
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,626
I bet Charles is looking for the
coins he hid all over the city.

462
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,019
They were so expensive.

463
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:23,847
Also, why does he keep saying
I'm 24 karat gold?

464
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,109
- No idea.
- Makes zero sense.

465
00:15:25,152 --> 00:15:26,371
- We'll have to
figure it out later.

466
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:27,938
In the meantime,
we gotta find those coins.

467
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:29,287
- Yes, but how do we figure out
where they are?

468
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:30,680
- All we have to do is solve

469
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,856
the entire six-hour
scavenger hunt immediately.

470
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:34,814
Raymond, toss me that sextant.

471
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:36,338
Guys, we can do this!

472
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:38,122
We cannot do this.

473
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,471
We're way too drunk.

474
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:40,777
But there has to be
someone that knows

475
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,778
where those coins are, right?

476
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,040
- Charles.

477
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,476
Charles would know.
- Brilliant!

478
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,348
We just have to find Charles,
but where might he be?

479
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:47,784
- He's probably digging up
the gold coins.

480
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,612
But who would know
where the gold coins are?

481
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:51,353
- Charles!
Charles knows where they are.

482
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:53,267
But where is he—
no, wait we're stuck in a loop.

483
00:15:53,311 --> 00:15:55,139
We're super drunk
and we're in a loop.

484
00:15:55,182 --> 00:15:57,184
We need to find someone
who isn't Charles

485
00:15:57,228 --> 00:15:58,708
who knows where the coins are.

486
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,408
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

487
00:16:03,452 --> 00:16:05,018
It's Reginald VelJohnson.

488
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:06,411
Who are you?
- I'm Jake Peralta.

489
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:07,717
You were part of
my bachelor party tonight.

490
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,283
- Oh, you're the jerk
who didn't show.

491
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:13,026
- He knows who I am.

492
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,117
- Okay, so I need to
come up with 15 grand

493
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:20,686
or my father/daughter dance is
going to be performed by that.

494
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,427
- Wrong. You're forgetting
the most obvious option.

495
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:23,863
Steal the contract
and destroy it.

496
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:26,213
I can't do that.

497
00:16:26,257 --> 00:16:28,041
You were right,
I'm a boring square

498
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:32,306
who's never actually had
a crazy, stranger bone session.

499
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,439
Gina, your looks are
just as hurtful as your words.

500
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,702
- I'm sorry.
I can only control so much.

501
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,530
I shouldn't have come back.
- Okay. Look.

502
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:40,184
You don't have to steal it.
We will.

503
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:41,446
Right?
- Hell yeah.

504
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,839
- You guys don't
have to do this.

505
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,231
- We told you.
We're your bridesmaids.

506
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:45,624
We have your back.
Okay.

507
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:47,321
I think if we distract him,
I can sneak in

508
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:48,758
and take the contract
out of his man purse.

509
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:51,587
He saw all of us with Amy.

510
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,066
- Not all of us.

511
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,285

512

I've heard that name.

00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,263
Where is it?

521
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:18,265
Why are there
so many scarves in here?

522
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:21,530
- [imitates bird screeching,

523
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,183
- I see him, Gina.
Thank you.

524
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:25,577
- Look, Sergeant Powell,

525
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:27,187
oh, I'm sorry, is it okay
if I call you by

526
00:17:27,231 --> 00:17:28,275
your character name
from "Die Hard"?

527
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,668
- No.
- Okay.

528
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,540
Look, Reginald, do you know
why Charles hired you?

529
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,846
Because I love "Die Hard"
more than any other movie,

530
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,847
and I loved you in it.

531
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:36,153
- For the record,

532
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:37,589
I loved you
from "Family Matters."

533
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,939
Carl Winslow made me
want to become a cop.

534
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:41,245
- Come on, Terry,
you already have

535
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:42,376
like six other reasons
you became a cop.

536
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,639
This is not your moment.

537
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,292
And for the record,
that's the first time

538
00:17:45,336 --> 00:17:46,685
I've ever heard him
even mention "Family Matters."

539
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:48,513
- Look, it's late.
Please leave.

540
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:51,168
- Come on. Look—
my best friend is out there.

541
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:52,909
And you're the only one
who knows where he is.

542
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:54,563
So, as much as
I hate to do this,

543
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,739
you're gonna tell us
where those coins are hidden,

544
00:17:56,782 --> 00:17:57,653
or you're gonna regret it.

545
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,046
- Stay here all night,

546
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,091
making this sound:

547
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,314
- Fine, fine.

548
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:08,751
I'll tell you where he is.
- Yes.

549
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:09,969
Thank you so much.

550
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,318
Also, we're gonna
need you to take us there,

551
00:18:11,362 --> 00:18:12,929
'cause we're all
too drunk to drive.

552
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:15,584
- You thought you could
distract me with a record deal?

553
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,543
Please,
I'm already represented,

554
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:19,413
by my mom.

555
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:20,806
- God, you're a turd.

556
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,199
- Well, this turd

557
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:24,157
is your best friend's
future husband.

558
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,681
- Doink!
- Hey, wait, no!

559
00:18:25,724 --> 00:18:27,639
Give that back to me!
- I'm wild!

560
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:30,773
- Keep going! Keep going!

561
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:33,384
- He's gaining on you.
- Not for long.

562
00:18:33,427 --> 00:18:35,517
Free shots for everyone!

563
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,171
- Turtle Bug!

564
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,218
- Whoo!

565
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:42,524
Buh-bye, Connie!

566
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,743
Tell your mother
I said I never loved you,

567
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:47,441
and that your whole family
is a bunch of friggin—

568
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:52,011
- Oh.

569
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:54,057
- Whoo, I broke a rule!

570
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:57,800
- Never have I ever
slept with a guy,

571
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,758
broken his heart,
hired him to play at my wedding,

572
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,543
stolen a legally binding
contract from him,

573
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,501
jumped on a bar
and dumped booze on everyone,

574
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:05,634
fallen off the bar, probably
given myself a concussion...

575
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,026
and a permanent scar.

576
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,202
- I have ever!

577
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:11,553
- Well, it is officially
after midnight,

578
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:13,990
so I can now
say whatever I want.

579
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,165
- Uh-oh.

580
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,688
- Tonight was awesome,

581
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,690
and I loved hanging out
with your dorks.

582
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:20,692
- Aww, yeah.

583
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,390
You know, the word "dork"

584
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:25,610
is actually a Celtic word
meaning "lungfish."

585
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:27,786
- Kylie, I'm trying so hard.

586
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,396
- This is where he
told me to wait for you.

587
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,789
- Oh, my God.
This is the corner where

588
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,313
John McClane met Zeus Carver
in "Die Hard 3."

589
00:19:33,357 --> 00:19:35,272
Oh, Charles.
Yes, you're here.

590
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:37,013
How did you find me?

591
00:19:37,056 --> 00:19:38,057
Did you solve the puzzle?

592
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:39,276
- No, they didn't.

593
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,320
They cheated again.

594
00:19:40,364 --> 00:19:41,670
- Reginald.

595
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,584
Hey man, look.

596
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:43,976
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

597
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,065
- No, I'm the one
who should apologize.

598
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,545
I overdid it tonight.

599
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,503
I wanted everything
to be perfect, because

600
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:52,071
it's our last big night
before you get married.

601
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:53,769
I guess I was a little worried

602
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,205
things were gonna
change between us.

603
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:58,077
- Oh, Charles.
Come on.

604
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:00,036
Of course,
things are gonna change.

605
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,428
I'm getting married.

606
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:03,605
I mean, didn't you make me
less of a priority

607
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:08,305
when you and Genevieve
got together?

608
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:09,915
- Yes.

609
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,178
I mean, no matter what,
we'll always be best friends.

610
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:13,702
- Hey, you know why

611
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,312
I didn't like
your scavenger hunt?

612
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:16,748
- 'Cause it was stupid
and overcomplicated.

613
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,836
- And way too long.

614
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,533
- There was no food.
- Or drinks.

615
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:20,622
- This is not
a group conversation, guys.

616
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:21,753
- Well, you could have stood

617
00:20:21,797 --> 00:20:22,972
a little farther
away from us then.

618
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,190
- Point taken.

619
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:25,583
I didn't like it because

620
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:27,629
you got kidnapped
right at the beginning.

621
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:29,326
You were gone for six hours.

622
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:33,156
I wanted to spend
my bachelor party with you.

623
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:35,549
I can't believe you pissed off

624
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:37,377
Reginald VelJohnson
just to find me.

625
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:38,814
- Oh, please.
He'll get over it.

626
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:41,512
- No, I won't.
You've made an enemy for life.

627
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:43,296
And I'm telling Bruce Willis
you suck.

628
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:49,259
That's fine.
I'm fine with that.

629
00:20:49,302 --> 00:20:51,217
It's good.
What's important is that

630
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:52,915
we made up, my best friend.

631
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,960
Not Bruce Willis.

632
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,092
- To Jake and Amy!

633
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:57,484
all: To Jake and Amy!

634
00:20:57,528 --> 00:20:59,748
To us!

635
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,793
- Hey, so I need to
tell you something.

636
00:21:01,837 --> 00:21:04,448
I had to cancel
the wedding band,

637
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:06,798
because I kind of dated
one of the dudes in it.

638
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:08,234
- Yeah, I know.
Man bun.

639
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:09,845
He left me a very long message

640
00:21:09,888 --> 00:21:11,977
with a lot of details.
- Oh, no.

641
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,805
- He seems like
a really passionate guy.

642
00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:15,285
- I'm never gonna
live this down.

643
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:16,808
- No, you are not.

644
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:18,331
- I'm just kidding.
I'll never bring it up again.

645
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,724
- Thank you.
You're the sweetest.

646
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,248
I love you.
- I love you too, Turtle Bug.

647
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,467
- Oh, my...
- Yeah.

648
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,164
- Uh, do I still
need to be here?

649
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,557
- Yes, Reginald.

650
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,212
We're all toasted
and we need rides home!

651
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,301
It's Reginald VelJohnson!

652
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:33,259
Not a doctor.
Shh.

653
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:34,783
- Fremulon.
