00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:59,279
- Lucky.

174
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:00,881
- So why don't you both
come back tomorrow

175
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:02,115
and we can start
working this together?

176
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:03,984
And, who knows,
if you find the guy,

177
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:06,519
I got an open spot
on my squad.

178
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:07,954
Maybe one of you could fill it.

179
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:10,090
- Or maybe one of us
could fill it.

180
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:11,958
- Excuse me?
- What you said—better.

181
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,094
Rosa, leave now?

182
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:15,796
This is amazing.

183
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,130
I've always wanted to be
on that squad.

184
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:18,832
- Me too. Working with her
would be insane.

185
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:20,300
- What do we do?

186
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,002
I mean, there's only one spot
and the two of us,

187
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,904
unless one of us
wanted to back off

188
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:26,106
because the other said it first.
That seems fair.

189
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,908
- Look, none of this matters
if we don't find Ocampo.

190
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:29,509
Let's just do our jobs,

191
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,111
and Hawkins will do
whatever she's gonna do.

192
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:32,779
Doesn't have to be
a competition, right?

193
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:34,848
- Right. Right?
- Right.

194
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:37,818
Right?
- Right.

195
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,853
both: Right.

196
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:44,424
- So based on
these phone records,

197
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:45,826
we think Ocampo
is definitely still in Brooklyn.

198
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,460
Unrelated question:
Is it true

199
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:49,162
you still have a bullet
lodged in your hip

200
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:50,463
from your shootout with
the Canarsie Killer?

201
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:52,132
- No.
- Darn.

202
00:06:52,165 --> 00:06:53,333
- It's in my jaw.
- Yes.

203
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:55,135
- This is nice work, guys.

204
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:57,103
Who figured out
he was cloning his credit card?

205
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:58,404
- Oh, uh, couldn't tell you.
- I don't know.

206
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:00,140
Can't remember.
- Yeah, can't recall.

207
00:07:00,173 --> 00:07:01,374
- We don't really keep score.

208
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:03,176
- Yeah, we're super
non-competitive.

209
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:05,211
- Great.
So what's our next move?

210
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:07,180
How do we find this guy?

211
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,448
- I say we tap
his brother's phone.

212
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:10,283
They're tight.
He'll definitely call.

213
00:07:10,316 --> 00:07:11,885
- Jake, you agree?

214
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:13,286
- Yes, I think
that's a great idea.

215
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,221
Fully support that.
Totally love it.

216
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:16,923
The one thing
I will say, though,

217
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:19,225
is, it could take us a while
to get a warrant.

218
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,927
And we know
he's hard up for cash,

219
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,428
and we also know
that's his primary buyer,

220
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:24,931
so we could see
what this guy knows.

221
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:27,367
- Both smart suggestions.
I say we do...

222
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,204
Peralta's.
- Yes.

223
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:33,306
[fake groan]
Sorry, it's—muscle spasm.

224
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,308
- Whatever.

225
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:36,910
- Diaz, you ride?

226
00:07:36,943 --> 00:07:39,212
- Yeah, I got a supercharged R1.
- Engine?

227
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:41,214
- 4-stroke, in-line four
with dual overhead cams.

228
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:42,949
- Wow, that's a lot of bike.

229
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:45,919
I ride a custom-6
L-capacity superbike.

230
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,854
- What is that?
Like, 180 horses?

231
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:49,956
- 210.
Purrs like a puma in heat.

232
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,391
- I also ride motorcycles.

233
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:52,959
- Oh, yeah?
What do you ride?

234
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:54,961
- Oh, it's in the shop
right now.

235
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,429
Yeah, the torque felt low,

236
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:58,498
so I was like,
"Bro, we gots to up the torque."

237
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:00,466
We all know how it is.

238
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,368
Anyways, I could talk about
my steel horse all darn day.

239
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:05,338
We got work to do.
[chuckles] Rosa.

240
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:08,174
- Sarge, Hitchcock and Scully
are out of control.

241
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,976
They got into a fight
over the ranch dressing,

242
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,411
and now it's everywhere.

243
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:13,880
- [grunts]
- I figured it out, Boyle.

244
00:08:13,914 --> 00:08:15,448
They've been acting
like kids,

245
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:17,483
so I'm gonna
treat 'em like kids.

246
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:20,453
- Ooh, Daddy's gonna dish out
some Daddy discipline.

247
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,388
As a fellow daddy, I approve.

248
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:24,257
- Stop saying "daddy."
- You got it, Papa Bear.

249
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,259
- Hmm, I actually
kinda like that one.

250
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,994
Makes me feel strong.

251
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:29,896
Anyway, I'm gonna take away
something they love

252
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,264
until they stop fighting.

253
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:32,899
- Papa Bear punishment.
Daddy like!

254
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:36,002
- Boyle!
You two, up now!

255
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:38,905
I'm taking away the thing
you love most in the world.

00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,441
You'll get your chairs back

to each other.

259
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:45,011

I'm sorry...

00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,547

Nah, haven't seen him
in months.

271
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:07,934
I don't know how to reach him.
- Okay.

272
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:09,502
Then I guess we'll just set up
surveillance here full-time.

273
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:12,305
I'm sure your shady customers
will love that.

- Oh, well, I—
- Tell me where he is.

275
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,543
I'm gonna count to three.
There will not be a four.

276
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:19,512
- Okay, fine,
he was here this morning,

277
00:09:19,545 --> 00:09:21,514
but I didn't buy anything.

278
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,516
Here, he left this number
in case I change my mind.

279
00:09:23,549 --> 00:09:25,551
- Uh, thank you.

280
00:09:25,585 --> 00:09:28,554
Here you go, Lieutenant.
- "There will not be a four."

281

"Die Hard." Nice.

282

- You like "Die Hard"?
- Best movie ever.

283
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,060
- Best franchise ever.

284
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:36,062
I even have the Justin Long one
on Blu-ray.

285
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,964
- I saw the fifth one
in the theaters.

286
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:39,399
- So did I! Wait, there was
only one other person there.

287
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:41,067
Was that you?
- Atlantic Avenue?

288
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:42,502
- No, but that would've been
a cool coincidence.

289
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:45,005
- I also like "Die Hard."

290
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:47,240
- Really, Rosa?
What's your favorite part?

291
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:48,374
- The shootouts.
- Interesting.

292
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:50,410
Vague and interesting.

293
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:52,045
But it's funny
'cause I always thought

294
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:54,080
your favorite movies
were made by Nancy Meyers.

295
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:55,481
- Seriously?
- What? No.

296
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:57,383
I hate that crap.
- Really?

297
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,519
So you hate the one starring
Diane Keaton and John Wick?

00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:01,454
What was it called again?
- I don't know.

- "Something's Gotta Give."

- I got ya.

- Can I get a trace on
this number right away, please?

302
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,063
- No need.
We know where Ocampo is.

303
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:11,597
We got the warrant
for Diaz's tap.

304
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:13,099
He called his brother
and arranged a meet-up.

305

It's about to go down.

306

my idea worked after all.

307
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:17,303
- Did it, though?
- Yes, it did.

308
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:19,105
Nice job, Diaz.

309
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:20,640
Come on, suit up, everyone.
We gotta go right away.

310
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:22,442
- Sounds good.
Maybe we should take our bikes.

311
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:24,544
- Cool idea, but is it
the best move tactically?

312
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:26,346
- Yes, it is. That way,
we can slip through traffic.

313
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,014
- Totally.
However, as mentioned,

314
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:30,383
my hog is up
in the torque shop,

315
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,386
just getting...
torqued up the hog,

316
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,122

just share one car over there.

inconvenience Floppy Foot.

- Sure he wouldn't mind.
- Right.

Even so, it's not like
we have his keys.

00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:45,098
Uh, look at that.
- Let's go.

511
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,749
- Hey.

512
00:17:43,783 --> 00:17:44,984
Before we take Ocampo
over to the Slaughterhouse,

513
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:47,086
I just wanted to
make sure you were okay,

514
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,022
'cause you are sharpening
that knife very intensely.

515
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:51,724
- Makes me feel better.

516
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:53,659
- I'm the same way
with "MAD" magazine

517
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,661
and "Cracked" magazine.
Ah, they're both so good.

518
00:17:55,695 --> 00:17:57,029
Tough to pick.
I mean, "MAD" is the original,

519
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:58,898
but "Cracked"--[laughs]
They've always got a take.

520
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:01,100
- Okay, I'm done.
Let's go.

521
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:02,902
- Wait.

522
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,169
Look, I know it sucks
there's only one spot,

523
00:18:04,203 --> 00:18:06,872
but working for Hawkins
is my dream.

524
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:08,774
I mean, she takes down the
biggest criminals in the city.

525
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:10,676
- I get it.
Dude, it's just,

526
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,177
our captain's a man,
our sergeant's a man.

527
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:15,014
Every superior officer
I've ever had has been a man.

528
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:16,882
It just seemed cool
to work for a badass woman

529
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,851
like Hawkins for once,
but whatever, I'm good.

530
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,188
Also, I spiked your gum
with caffeine.

531
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,924
- How?

532
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,160
- Face it, Charles,

533
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:29,795
we couldn't
make 'em get along.

534
00:18:29,829 --> 00:18:31,063
We failed as parents.

535
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:33,032
- Why did I think
I knew what I was doing?

536
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:35,034
Poor Nikolaj.
His life is ruined.

537
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,803
- My God, you two are fools.

538
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:40,840
[laughs]

539
00:18:42,207 --> 00:18:44,944
Your folly was in
treating them as children.

540
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:47,813
- Of course, we should've been
treating 'em like adults.

541
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:49,181
- No, wrong again.

542
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:50,950
They're not children.
They're not adults.

543
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:54,086
They're animals—
filthy, wild animals—

544
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,855
and they need to be
treated accordingly.

545
00:18:55,888 --> 00:18:57,990
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it right now!

546
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:00,059
- But he won't let me—
- [shouts indistinctly]

547
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:02,828
- [growls]
- [whimpers]

548
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:07,733
- You two gonna be friends now?
No? Okay, fine, yeah.

549
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,736
Who wants a cookie?
Ah, let me hear you apologize.

550
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,005
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, better apology, please.

551
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:15,074
- I'm sorry for neglecting
our friendship.

552
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:16,909
You're my best friend.
- Your turn.

553
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:18,978
- Well, I'm sorry too.
You're my best friend.

554
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:20,813
- Good boys!

555
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:22,915
Stay.
Stay, stay.

556
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:24,750
Eat it!

557
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:27,987
God, I'm gonna make
a great dad someday.

558
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,755
[upbeat music]

559
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,791
- You got Ocampo?
- Oh, yeah,

560
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:33,859
and you'll never guess
where we found him.

561
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:36,128
In the bathroom...
not going.

562
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:38,130
He was hiding.
I ruined the story.

563
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:40,866
- Did he give you any info about
the Golden Gang bank robbers?

564
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,134
- No, we thought
we'd leave that to you.

565
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,969
- Well, I appreciate that.

566
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:46,205
So who found him?

567
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:48,107
Who's gonna join my squad?
- Jake.

568
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,242
- Thank you, Rosa,
for introducing me.

569
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:52,211
Yes, I am Jake,
and I'm announcing that

570
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:54,914
the person joining your
task force is Detective Diaz.

571
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:56,949
- What? No, you found him.

572
00:19:56,982 --> 00:19:57,983
- Because you said
we should split up.

573
00:19:58,017 --> 00:19:59,218
It was the correct call.

574
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:01,020
- Yeah, but you brought him in.
You won.

575
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,254
- Agree to disagree.
I say you won.

576
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,023
- I think you won.
- I say you won.

577
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:05,891
- Dude, you clearly won—
- Shut up!

578
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:08,127
You've got each other's backs.
I like that.

579
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,963
Loyalty is the most
important thing to me,

580
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:12,898
so I tell you
what I'm gonna do.

581
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:14,900
How about I'm gonna put you
both on the task force?

582
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,803
- Oh, okay, whatever.
- That works, I guess.

583
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,271
- It's fine idea.
Not that we really cared.

584
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:21,040
- I wasn't really listening.
What are we talking about?

585
00:20:21,073 --> 00:20:23,943
Ah! We got it!
- Ah! [laughing]

586
00:20:23,976 --> 00:20:26,879
Wait a minute. Are we hugging?
Have we ever done this before?

587
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:28,247
- No, and if you tell anyone,
I'll slit your throat.

588
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,049
- Oh.
- Thank you so much, Jake.

589
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:31,917
- Please.
I'm just glad you finally

590
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,185
get to work for a woman
as badass as you are.

591
00:20:33,218 --> 00:20:35,287
And as a man,
I'd like to apologize

592
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,089
for my gender's history—
- Don't ruin it.

593
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:38,257
- Okay.
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink

594
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,192
that doesn't have
any pills in it.

595
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:41,927
- Sounds good, but I wish
you hadn't mentioned liquid.

596
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:43,162
Now I have to pee.
I promise you

597
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:44,897
I will never drink water
ever again.

598
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,066
- Thank God.
- It's the worst. BRB.

599
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:53,272
♪

600
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:55,174
- Did you tell 'em anything?

601
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:58,277
- No, they have no idea
what's really going on.

602
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,145
- Pretty.

603
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,147
See how much you can
get me for these, hmm?

604
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:05,117
Try not to get caught
this time.

605
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,086
- Oh, no.

606
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:09,021
She dirty.

607
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,257
- Not a doctor. Shh.
