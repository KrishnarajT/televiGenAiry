got me these suspenders,

speak like this, Sergeant.

52

I like it.

Doesn't matter.

00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,477

Pssh.

Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down.

with the windows?

124
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:57,231
Jake, tell them to stop.

125
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:58,599
- But playing with the windows
is fun.

126
00:03:58,632 --> 00:03:59,433
- Jake.
- And...

127
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:01,168
it could spark
a lifelong interest

128
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:02,269
in mechanical engineering.

129
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:04,605
But sure. If you want,
I'll tell these young girls

130

is a good fit for them.

I think we rocked it.

135

that was so easy.

137
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,420

- Where the hell is Moo Moo?

145
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:34,135
- Oh, no. I think Terry
has a child named Moo Moo,

146
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:35,269
and we forgot to pick her up.

147
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:36,370
- It's not a baby, Jake.

It's Cagney's blankie.

She calls it that because
it has a little cow head.

She said
she had it in the minivan.

all: Up. Down. Up. Down.
Up. Down. Up. Down.

154

- Never let 'em
play with the windows.

00:04:48,915 --> 00:04:50,451
That's Parenting 101.

156
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:52,519
And Santiago, I can't believe
you didn't stop it.

157
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:53,420
- I'm sorry, sir.

158
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:55,256
I knew it was wrong,
and I did nothing,

159
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,490
which is ultimately worse.

160
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:58,325
- Cagney can't sleep
without Moo Moo,

161
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,694
and if Cagney doesn't sleep,
then Lacey doesn't sleep,

162
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,529
and if Cagney and Lacey
don't sleep—

163
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:03,630
- Terry doesn't sleep.

164
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:05,166
- No. Jake doesn't live.

165
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,032
- Oh, my God.
- Where did you start

166
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,668
letting them play
with the windows?

167
00:05:07,701 --> 00:05:10,171
- Uh, on Eighth.
It was close to the house.

168
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:10,971
- It better be.

169
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:12,273
The sitter leaves
in ten minutes,

170
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:13,707

I need!

171
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,143
- Okay.
So sorry about this, Sarge.

172
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:17,311
Oh, and one more thing.

173
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:22,183
I love you.

174
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:24,251
- I love you too, Jake.

00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,861
but it's the right move.

348
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,129
- Holt's gonna eat him
for breakfast.

349
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:39,800
- Maldack has no idea
what's about to hit him.

350
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:43,670
- I'm not gonna submit this.

351
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:45,138
- What? Why not?

352
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:47,073
- Because
I think it's a mistake.

353
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:49,075
♪

354
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,180
- Hey, Sarge?
Everything okay?

355
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:58,184
Only ask 'cause you haven't
moved in the last 58 minutes.

356
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:00,153
- He doesn't want me
to file the complaint.

357
00:11:00,186 --> 00:11:02,155
- Well, of course
Officer Maldack doesn't want you

358
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:03,256
to file the complaint.

359
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,124
He's the one
being complained about.

360
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:05,859
I just realized
you meant Captain Holt.

361
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:06,960
- Yeah.
- What?

362
00:11:06,993 --> 00:11:08,261
Did you mess up the grammar

363
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,563
or something?
- Did you dangle a participle?

364
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:11,998
Ugh, Terry,
Holt hates a dangler.

365
00:11:12,032 --> 00:11:14,200
- Grammar was fine.

366
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:16,202
He said he thought
filing it was a mistake.

367
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:17,871
- Wow. Well, look.

368
00:11:17,904 --> 00:11:20,006
Captain Holt cares about you
more than anything.

369
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,975
I'm sure he's got a good reason.

370
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:23,276
Maybe you should go talk to him
about it, you know?

371
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,945
Go to his house.

372
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:27,180
- Yeah. That's a good idea.
I'm gonna do that.

373
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:28,649
- And while
you're talking to him,

374
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:30,551
Jake and Amy can babysit
your kids.

375
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,586
Unless they're too busy
making babies of their own.

376
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:35,622
Shaka-daka-dow.
- Get out of us.

377
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:38,291
But yes, we are happy
to look after the kids again.

378
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:40,894
- Thanks, guys.
I appreciate your support.

379
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,128
Now, I'm gonna go find out

380
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:45,231
what the hell is going on
with Captain Holt.

381
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,902
- Are you two sure
you should be babysitting?

382
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,070
You seemed real freaked
when you called me last night.

383
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:52,639
- Yes, but then we figured out
how to be good parents.

384
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,140
TV and cake.

385
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:56,242
- TV and cake were my parents.

386
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:58,679
[chuckles]

387
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:00,681
- It's okay.

388
00:12:03,216 --> 00:12:04,284
- Sergeant Jeffords.

389
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:05,285
- That's right.

390
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,553
It's me, Sergeant Jeffords,

391
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:07,320
from the precinct.

392
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:09,022
I'm the guy whose damn complaint

393
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:09,990
you don't want to submit,

394
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:13,059
and I can't think
of one damn reason why!

395
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,260
- Everyone.

396
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:16,229
This is Sergeant Jeffords.

397
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,265
- Hi!

398
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:21,301
I'm sorry for interrupting
your dinner party.

399
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:22,769
- No problem at all.
This is important.

400
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:24,337
Also,
Kevin's friend Margo is here,

401
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,306
and she's a real class-A drip.

402
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,175
- Sir, I can't get why you don't
want me to file the complaint.

403
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,678
I thought you of all people
would support me.

404
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:33,714
- First of all, let me say,
what that officer did to you

405
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:36,349
was wrong, deeply wrong,
and I'm furious about it.

406
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:38,284
- Okay.
So why don't you back me up?

407
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:40,353
- Because that complaint
could backfire.

408
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,188
Cops who blow the whistle
on other cops

409
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:43,957
almost always face a backlash,

410
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,026
just like people
who socialize with Margo

411
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,961
invariably hear about
her trip to Scottsdale.

412
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,362
- You're real worked up
about Margo.

413
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:50,764
- Sorry.

414
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:52,365
She's horrible.

415
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,267
Listen, I don't want to see
your career derailed

416
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,368
because you were besmirched

417
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,137
for reporting
on another officer.

418
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,238
- But what he did was wrong.

419
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:59,973
He should be besmirched!

420
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:00,841
- Yes,
but is that besmirching worth

421
00:13:00,874 --> 00:13:02,208
the greater besmirching
of your career?

422
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:03,777
You have to balance
besmirchings.

423
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,245
There's politics to being a cop.

424
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:06,980
- But I wasn't harassed
for being a cop.

425
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:08,715
I was harassed as a black man.

426
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:09,783
- I'm not saying do nothing.

427
00:13:09,816 --> 00:13:11,818
I'm saying
the most powerful action

428
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:13,720
you can take
is to rise through the ranks

429
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,388
so that you can make
large-scale changes.

430
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,223
I've had to pick my battles,

431
00:13:17,257 --> 00:13:18,725
and it hasn't always been easy,

432
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,293
but now I have my own precinct,

433
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:22,295
a precinct whose officers
would never do to you

434
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:23,730
what Officer Maldack did.

435
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:25,732
- I understand
what you're saying, but—

436
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,068
- Shh.

437
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,170
I hear Margo's squeaky shoes
in the hallway.

438
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:33,640
One guess as to where in Arizona
she brought them. Scottsdale.

439
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,308
- Oh. Ray.
There you are.

440
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:37,343
I'm about to start
my Scottsdale slideshow.

441
00:13:37,377 --> 00:13:38,411
It has all the highlights.

442
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:41,014
- There are no highlights
in Scottsdale, Margo.

443
00:13:41,047 --> 00:13:43,116
- That's what you think,
Raymond.

444
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,653
[breathing loudly]

445
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,756
- Okay, we got
chocolate-chocolate,

446
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,092
chocolate-vanilla,
and my personal favorite,

447
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,727
a bowl full of cake batter.

448
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,262
- And loads o' movies.
- Eh?

449
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:57,664
- We don't want to do that.

450
00:13:57,698 --> 00:13:59,099
- Uh, maybe you didn't

451
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,100
hear us correctly.

452
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,101
We've got cake.

453
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:02,102
We've got movies.

454
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:03,737
It's time to party!

455
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,138
- Is being black bad?
- We're black.

456
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:08,174
Are we gonna get in trouble
like Daddy?

457
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:10,443
- Jake, can I talk to you
for a second?

458
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:11,211
- Yes, please.

459
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:13,113
- We have a problem.
- I know.

460
00:14:13,146 --> 00:14:14,414
What kind of kids
don't want to eat cake?

461
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:16,416
Should we call Child Services
on Terry?

462
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:17,884
- Jake, I think
we have to face the music

463
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:19,385
and talk to them for real.

464
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,421
- I know.
You're right.

465
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:23,423
But I'm gonna munch the cake
batter while we do it.

466
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:24,691
If you don't
eat the raw egg fast,

467
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:27,293
it makes you even more sick.

468
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,095
- Never mind, let's go.
- Okay.

469
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,363
- Okay, girls.

470
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:31,431
There's something
called prejudice,

471
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:34,367
which comes from the Latin words
"pre," or "before,"

472
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,436
and "judicium,"
which means "to judge."

473
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:37,437
Are you with me so far?

474
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,405
both: No.
- No.

475
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,474
- Okay. Um,

476
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,376
you know how it's tougher
in this world to be a woman?

477
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:44,811
both: It is?

478
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:46,212
- No. No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

479
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:48,114
- Then I don't want to be
a woman.

480
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,382
- Me neither.
- You don't have to be

481
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:50,483
if that's who you are—
you know what?

482
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:51,918
That's a whole other
conversation.

483
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:53,820
Uh...
[sighs]

484
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:54,821
Okay. Here we go.

485
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,890
A cop did a bad thing

486
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,158
and tried to get your daddy
in trouble,

487
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,893
but your daddy didn't do
anything wrong.

488
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:02,362
- Because Daddy's black?

489
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:03,363
- Yeah.

490
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:04,865
- That's scary.

491
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:05,899
- It is scary.

492
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:08,468
But that cop was wrong,
and what he did was bad.

493
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,470
- And the most important thing
is your daddy's okay,

494
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:11,571
and he's not in trouble,

495
00:15:11,604 --> 00:15:13,907
and he loves you both
more than anything in the world.

496
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,209
- Okay?
both: Okay.

497
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:17,443
- Yeah. Okay.

498
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:19,913
Well, that wasn't so bad.

499
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:23,283
Well, if you guys have any other
questions, we're here for you.

500
00:15:23,316 --> 00:15:25,351
- What's an orgasm?
- Come on!

501
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:26,419
- Terry, I know you're upset,

502
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:27,487
but this is
the right thing to do.

503
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,756
You're this close
to the City Council position,

504
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,291
and that's just the beginning.

505
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:33,493
It would be a shame
to jeopardize that.

506
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:35,328
- Look, I get
that the guys in our precinct

507
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:36,329
wouldn't profile me,

508
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,430
but it still happened

509
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,365
only one precinct over.

510
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,134
- Which is why you need to keep
pushing forward in your career,

511
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:42,769
so that you can
change the system.

512
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:44,437
Terry, you're a great cop.

513
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,439
You could become
a chief or higher.

514
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:49,175
- How long will it take
to make change that way?

515
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,178
Maldack is on the street now.

516
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,546
You know why I became a cop?

517
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,547
- Please share.

518
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,949
- Because when I was a kid,

519
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:57,918
I always wanted
to be a superhero.

520
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,353
- Stop it!
Stop bothering little Terry!

521
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:03,389
- Or what?
- Or I will defeat you!

522
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:09,462
♪

523
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,232
Whoa.

524
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:15,836
- I wanted to help people
like that cop helped me.

525
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,403
But right now,

526
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:19,439
I don't feel like a superhero.

527
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:21,541
I feel the opposite.

528
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:23,810
When I got stopped
the other day,

529
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,979
I wasn't a cop.

530
00:16:26,012 --> 00:16:28,181
I wasn't a guy
who lived in a neighborhood

531
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,216
looking
for his daughter's toy.

532
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,855
I was a black man,
a dangerous black man.

533
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:39,459
That's all he could see:
a threat.

534
00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:42,528
And I couldn't stop thinking
about my daughters.

535
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:43,830
And their future.

536
00:16:43,864 --> 00:16:45,565
And how years from now,

537
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:47,968
they could be walking
down the street,

538
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,369
looking
for their kids' Moo Moo,

539
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,872
and get stopped by a bad cop.

540
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,874
And they probably won't
get to play the police card

541
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:56,943
to get out of trouble.

542
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,912
I don't like that thought,

543
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:01,014
and I'm gonna do something
about it.

544
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,483
So I don't care
if it might hurt my career.

545
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:05,518
I'm filing that report.

546
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:09,822
Even if I have to go
over your head to do it.

547
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,427
- Kind of seemed
like you were gonna

548
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,629
get up and leave
after saying all that.

549
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,598
- I was,
but I think I hear Margo.

550
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:24,004
- Thanks for babysitting
last night.

551
00:17:24,037 --> 00:17:25,405
The girls told me
what you talked about,

552
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:26,572
and it couldn't have been easy.

553
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:27,373
- I'm sorry I told them

554
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,075
orgasms was another word
for oranges.

555
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,610
I panicked.

556
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:31,611
- Yeah, it did make it awkward

557
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,880
when they asked for orgasm juice
this morning,

558
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,615
but I was more talking
about the other stuff.

559
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:37,517
- Yeah. We didn't really know
what to say.

560
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,052
At one point,
I'm pretty sure I sang

561
00:17:39,085 --> 00:17:40,954
all of En Vogue's
"Free Your Mind."

562
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:43,089
- Well, they had fun,
and you made 'em feel safe.

563
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:43,990
You did good.

564
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:46,960
Oh. They made you
a "thank you" card.

565
00:17:46,993 --> 00:17:47,928
- Aww.

566
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:50,130
Pretty sure
my nose isn't quite this big,

567
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:52,132
especially with all
the racial sensitivity talk,

568
00:17:52,165 --> 00:17:53,399
but I appreciate the effort.

569
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,001
- Sergeant Jeffords.

570
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:57,103
A moment of your time, please.

571
00:17:58,538 --> 00:17:59,906
I came to a realization

572
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,007
after you stormed out
last night.

573
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,043
- I wouldn't say I stormed out.

574
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:05,445
I shook hands with both you
and Kevin before I left.

575
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,113
- And Kevin and I agreed
that you squeezed

576
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:09,115
significantly tighter
than necessary.

577
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:10,650
- I guess I was
a little worked up.

578
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:12,085
- With good reason.

579
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:14,054
I thought a lot
about our conversation.

580
00:18:14,087 --> 00:18:15,521
When I was a young
police officer

581
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:17,457
and things like this
would happen to me,

582
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,458
I felt very alone.

583
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:22,128
I wanted to call out
every bad cop I encountered,

584
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:24,230
and there were a lot,
but as a black gay man,

585
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:27,500
I never had a superior
who was on my side,

586
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:29,169
so the advice I offered you,

587
00:18:29,202 --> 00:18:32,438
that came from a different place
at a different time.

588
00:18:32,472 --> 00:18:35,641
I put all my energy
towards rising to a rank

589
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:37,143
where I could make a difference.

590
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:43,449
Well, I'm there now,
and I realize

591
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:45,418
that if I don't
back you up on this,

592
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,620
I would be betraying
the very thing

593
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:50,023
that I worked so hard for,

594
00:18:50,056 --> 00:18:51,657
so I filed the complaint.

595
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:54,160
- I appreciate that, Captain.

596
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:58,664
- Are you still upset?
- No. Not at all.

597
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:00,066
- You should consider
modifying your handshake.

598
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,701
It's sending the wrong message.

599
00:19:01,734 --> 00:19:03,503
- Copy that.

600
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:06,039
- Whew. I am so glad
we don't have to do

601
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:07,173
any more babysitting
for a while.

602
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:09,242
- I know.
It was so stressful.

603
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:10,643
- So stressful.

604
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:13,213
But, like, actually
kind of rewarding too.

605
00:19:13,246 --> 00:19:16,149
- Shaping young minds like that
felt so powerful.

606
00:19:16,182 --> 00:19:18,051
- Yeah.
- But, like, so exhausting.

607
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:20,053
- Oh, yeah. Can you imagine
doing that every night?

608
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:20,920
Forget it.

609
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,056
But also, their little shoes
are so cute.

610
00:19:23,089 --> 00:19:24,157
They're like little circles.

611
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,059
- I know,
and everything they hold

612
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:28,528
looks so big
because their hands are so tiny.

613
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:31,064
- Yeah, and they have to hold
a cup of water with both hands

614
00:19:31,097 --> 00:19:32,165
'cause they're so weak.
- I know!

615
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:33,199
- Whoo-whee!

616
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,700
That's what I'm talking about!

617
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,669
both: Boyle.
- Lucky for you,

618
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,271
Amy, I am an unlicensed doula.

619
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:39,772
I've delivered three
of my cousins

620
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,707
and one of my uncles—
long story.

621
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:43,709
- Go away!
- Yes, Papa.

622
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,178
♪

623
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:46,679
- Please close the blinds.

624
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:49,215
We're about to violate several
departmental regulations.

625
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:51,117
- Ho, ho!
All right!

626
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,285
- It's been a very long week,

627
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:54,020
and as of right now,

628
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:55,521
we're both off duty.

629
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:56,656
I think we've earned a drink.

630
00:19:56,689 --> 00:19:59,059
- I can get behind that.

631
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:01,527
- I heard from City Council
about the liaison position.

632
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:03,129
- Is that right?

633
00:20:03,163 --> 00:20:04,130
- You didn't get it.

634
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:05,731
- Oh.

635
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:08,201
Oh, this is a sad drink.

636
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:10,036
Was it the complaint?

637
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,572
- We'll never know for sure,
but, uh, I think it's likely.

638
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:15,275
However, this is
not a sad drink.

639
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:16,642
We're celebrating

640
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:21,247
to doing the right thing.

641
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:24,184
- I don't know.

642
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,719
Maybe we shouldn't have
filed the complaint.

643
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:29,722
Maybe I could've done more
if I had gotten the liaison job.

644
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:30,790
- Maybe.

645
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:32,225
But one thing's for certain.

646
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:33,226
Maldack will think twice

647
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:36,096
before making another bad stop
like that again.

648
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,663
That's a win.

649
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:39,665
- Yeah.

650
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:41,601
It's tough.

651
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,169
- It is.

652
00:20:44,837 --> 00:20:46,239
So if Sharon's
still out of town,

653
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:48,174
who's, uh, looking out
for Cagney and Lacey?

654
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,144
both: [screaming]

655
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:53,213
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
