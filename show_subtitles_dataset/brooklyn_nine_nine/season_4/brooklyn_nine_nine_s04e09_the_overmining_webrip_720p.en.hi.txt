00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:56,737
figure out who Flaco is and
then you take him down.

166
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,872
- Oh, come on, Jake.

167
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:01,775
I'll just screw it up
like I screw up everything else.

168
00:07:01,808 --> 00:07:03,043
- No, you won't,
because I will be there

169
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:05,646
to help you, but don't worry,
you'll still get all the credit.

170
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,682
Listen to me, C.J., we're gonna
get you the hell out of here.

171
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,684
- Are you sugarcoating
this for me?

172
00:07:10,717 --> 00:07:11,952
- I most certainly am not.

173
00:07:11,985 --> 00:07:14,621
- Whoo, that's gonna
leave a mark.

174
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:15,656
- Ahh.

175
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:19,893
- So, Captain, I've been
thinking about this whole

176
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:23,063
missing backpack thing,
and what if we find Flaco

177
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:25,098
and take him down?
- Oh, are you trying to solve

178
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:26,833
C.J.'s case behind his back
to embarrass him?

179
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,235
- No, not at all.
In fact, I think C.J.

180
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:32,038
should come along.
I just realized how important

181
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:34,841
my duty as a police officer
is to me, you know?

182
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,778
The sacred oath I took.
Your speech really inspired me.

183
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,045
- Well, it was one of
my better ones.

184
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,847
Felt really good
as I was saying it.

185
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,983
- Yeah.
- So what's the plan, son?

186
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:45,351
- Well, Dad, we don't know
where Flaco is, but I have

187
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:48,121
a C.I. who says he's got an
agreement with Marco Severino.

188
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:50,857
- So you think we should pose
as drug dealers looking for

189
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,093
a new heroin supplier
and get Severino

190
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:54,861
to hook us up with Flaco.
And you think

191
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:57,030
C.J. can handle this mission.
- I know he's inexperienced,

192
00:07:57,063 --> 00:07:58,131
but he's a creative guy.

193
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,833
I think he'd be great
undercover.

194
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:04,838
- Okay, muchachos, let's roll up
on these muchachos.

195
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:07,273
- Great start, and I love
your double use of "muchachos."

196
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:10,010
- Hey, it's C.J.,
by the way.

197
00:08:10,043 --> 00:08:14,915
[machine whirring]
- Oooh, that's a nice lam job.

198
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:16,883
This one goes on the blog.
[shutter clicks]

199
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,084
- [clears throat]

200
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:20,053
- Hey, Sarge, what up, bro?

201
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:22,022
- "What up, bro?"
You're laminating

202
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:24,024
in here, aren't you?
- I'm sorry.

203
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:25,091
I just love it so much.

204
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,161
- It's okay, I'm used to it.
No one listens to me.

205
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:31,264
I'm a lousy sergeant.
- What? No, don't say that.

206
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:34,034
Why would you say that?
- If I tell you something,

207
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,836
you promise not to
tell anyone else?

208
00:08:35,869 --> 00:08:37,804
- Of course.
- You know how I took

209
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,339
the lieutenant's exam last week?
- Uh-huh.

210
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:41,174
- I just found out
I didn't pass.

211
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:45,178
- Oh, no, but you shouldn't
feel bad, only like 10%

212
00:08:45,211 --> 00:08:46,847
of people pass on the first try.

213
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,281
- I know, and I'm all exhausted

214
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:50,884
because of the night shift,
plus my bathroom break

215
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:53,153
during the test took a little
longer than anticipated.

216
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:55,155
- May I use the restroom,
please?

217
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:58,324
[creak]
Uh-oh, nothing to see here.

218
00:08:58,358 --> 00:09:01,094
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Little desk.

219
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:04,931
- That's why they say
"it's test time, so diaper up."

220
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:05,999
They say that,
I've never said that.

221
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,134
I've never worn a diaper during
test. Who would wear

222
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:09,903
a diaper during a test?
That's ridiculous, I mean—

223
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:13,039
- Santiago.
- Sorry, look, don't give up

224
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:15,341
on the green initiative.
You're a great sergeant.

225
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,143
You'll get everyone on board.
- Not Gina.

226
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:20,947
- Yes, Gina. You can handle her.
You can do this.

227
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:23,083
Sarge, it's test time.

228
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:25,085
- Diaper up.

229
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:27,353
- Thank you for coming along
with me on this manhunt.

230
00:09:27,387 --> 00:09:29,189
I needed your help.
- No problem,

231
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:31,091
who are we looking for?
- He's a one-armed smuggler

232
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:33,426
from the dunes of Tunisia.
He goes by the name

233
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,062
of Señor Riff Raff.
- You're taking me

234
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,964
to that foot massage place.
- I am taking you

235
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:40,200
to the foot massage place.
I made that whole thing up.

236
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,835
- Shocking.
- Look, the night shift

237
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:43,369
hasn't been easy on any of us.

238
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:45,105
Let me make it slightly better

239
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:46,406
by paying a
strong-handed woman

240
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:49,175
to literally milk
the stress from your feet.

241
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,244
- Just shut up, I'll do it once.
- [gasps]

242
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,979
Yes!
- As long as you promise

243
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:55,448
to never ever talk about
foot milk again.

244
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,384
- Deal, you're gonna love it.
- I guarantee you, I won't.

245
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:02,222
both: Mmm.

246
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:05,025
- All right, that's
Severino's restaurant.

247
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:07,894
My C.I. says he's in there.
- Whoo, I'm pumped. I'm ready.

248
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:10,363
- Um, just out of curiosity,
how—how scared are you guys?

249
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:13,399
- Not at all. How about you?
- I'm terrified,

250
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,600
but, you know,
I just keep telling myself,

251
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:17,037
worst comes to worst, just
start shooting things, you know?

252
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,872
- I think it might be better
if you stayed in the van.

253
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,106
- Wait, are you
trying to sideline me?

254
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,274
- Yes.
- Oh, thank God.

255
00:10:21,307 --> 00:10:23,209
[laughs]
- But just because you're

256
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:24,344
in the van doesn't mean
you're not an important

257
00:10:24,377 --> 00:10:26,046
part of the mission.
Your job will be

258
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,047
to keep an eye on
the restaurant.

259
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,149
And, if anybody suspicious
walks in, you just—

260
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:30,450
- Run everybody over
with the van and then

261
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:32,052
back up if
they're still moving.

262
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:33,253
- Don't try and guess
where I'm going with it.

263
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:35,288
You keep an eye on the door.
If anyone suspicious walks in,

264
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,290
let us know in our ear pieces.
- Oh, I could

265
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:39,125
do that, absolutely.
You know, actually I saw

266
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,095
those ear pieces on "Ellen."
One time, Justin Bieber was on,

267
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:44,297
and he was supposed to be, like,
a security guard, only—

268
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,166
- C.J., I'm loving the story,
but we gotta go in.

269
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:47,333
- I'll finish later.
- TBC.

270
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,237
- Thanks for hand-laminating,
Santiago.

271
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:56,309
- Of course, if you ask me,
saving energy is trending.

272
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:59,412
Oh, Gina, didn't see you there.
- Gina, did you shut off

273
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:02,382
your space heater yet?
- Space heater...

274
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:04,417
Doesn't ring any bells.
- Jacinta.

275
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,186
- Oh, no, she's still
going strong.

276
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:10,323
- I will take that thing away
from you by force, if necessary.

277
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:13,459
- Well, come and get it.
- Seriously?

278
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:17,030
The heater's under your skirt?
- Maybe. You can't prove that.

279
00:11:17,063 --> 00:11:19,165
- Yeah, I can.
There's a cord running under it,

280
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:23,036
and I think you may be on fire.
- Mm, so?

281
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:26,206
- What do you mean "so"?
- I'm not giving up Jacinta.

282
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:30,043
- You are on fire, Gina.
You do not have the upper hand

283
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:33,346
in this situation.
- I always have the upper hand.

284
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,548
- Not when there's flames
shooting out of your butt!

285
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:39,052
- Especially when there's flames
shooting out of my butt.

286
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:45,258
[smoke detector beeping]

287
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,461
- Damn it.

288
00:11:48,494 --> 00:11:51,564
[hissing]

289
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:54,434
How the hell
did I lose that one?

290
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,370
- Hey, you Severino?
- Who wants to know?

291
00:11:57,403 --> 00:12:00,106
- I'm Cal, this is Billy.
We used to buy from Rosario,

292
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,574
but he got busted by the feds,
and we're looking for

293
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:03,977
a new hookup.
- Guys, we got company.

294
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,112
There's a lady with a dog,
and a man with a ponytail.

295
00:12:06,146 --> 00:12:09,049
Another lady with a dog,
two dogs back to back, guys.

296
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:11,117
Is that fishy?
- I knew Rosario.

297
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:12,352
- Seems fishy to me...
- So how's come...

298
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:15,121
- There's a lot of dogs out—
- I never heard of you?

299
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:16,189
- Well, you can ask
Rosario's guys about us.

300
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:17,290
- They're right
on top of each other.

301
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:19,392
If you think it's weird, just
cough once for yes,

302
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:20,626
twice for no.
- I didn't come here

303
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,163
to be accused of something.
We can buy from somebody else.

304
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:24,530
- Jake, I need an answer,
why is nobody coughing?

305
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:26,432
- [stammering]
Hold up, I got a right to know

306
00:12:26,466 --> 00:12:28,401
who I might be in business with.
- I need an answer on

307
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,570
the dog thing, is it weird?
Can somebody cough?

308
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:31,737
- [coughs]

309
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,039
- Whose cough was that?
Was that you, Jake?

310
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:36,009
If it was you, cough twice,
if it was somebody else,

311
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,210
cough three times.
- [coughs]

312
00:12:37,243 --> 00:12:40,246
Sorry, bad allergy day,
pollen count is off the charts.

313
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,149
- Pollen count, oh, man, how
do you come up with that stuff?

314
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:45,285
- So what's your territory?
- But that's why you guys are

315
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:47,220
in there, and I'm out here.
- We don't sell on the streets.

316
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:48,421
We have loyal buyers
that come to us.

317
00:12:48,454 --> 00:12:49,689
- On the mic, you know...
- And we need quality product,

318
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:52,225
our customers are discerning.
- Check one, check two, check,

319
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:55,161
check, DJ C.J. on the mic.
- I got a guy that could get

320
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,263
you the best dope in the city.
- You know, I actually did DJ

321
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:58,498
my sister's wedding.
- But it ain't gonna be cheap.

322
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,300
- It did not turn out well.
Apparently, there's such a thing

323
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,402
as too much Smash Mouth.
- I'm sorry, you think we wanna

324
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:04,070
deal with complete strangers?
- God, sometimes I look at my

325
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:05,305
sister, and I'm like...
- I mean, we gotta

326
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:06,606
cover our own asses.
- She's got two kids,

327
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,341
beautiful house, and I'm like...
- How do we know

328
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:09,675
this guy's even legit?
- C.J., what have you

329
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,077
done with your life?
- Shut up!

330
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:12,078
- Stop talking!
- Ahh!

331
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:13,079
- Shut up, now!
- Oh, my God.

332
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:13,980
- Shut up, C.J.

333
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:14,981
- Oh, whoa, whoa,
what are you, cops?

334
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:16,116
- Yes, obviously we're cops.
Put your hands up.

335
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,318
- Whoa, who said we were cops?
We haven't gotten any

336
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:21,187
information we needed yet.
Jake, you're blowing it, man.

337
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,189
- Stop talking!

338
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:29,262
- Crime scene investigators
combed every inch

339
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:30,463
of Severino's restaurant,
no drugs.

340
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:32,298
- Well, we can't hold him much
longer, and he's not talking.

341
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:34,334
The interrogation
did not exactly go well.

342
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,601
You're gonna tell us
who Flaco is, and you're

343
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:37,470
gonna tell us right now.
[crash]

344
00:13:37,503 --> 00:13:39,739
- Oh, that was crazy.

345
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,441
- Well, there's one
bit of good news.

346
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,609
The last call on Severino's
phone was to a contact

347
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:45,678
we believe to be Flaco.
We've tracked his location

348
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:48,381
to a warehouse by the water.
We're gonna storm the place.

349
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:51,351
- Great, I'll go get C.J.
- Why? Why are you

350
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:53,319
so determined to make
him a part of this?

351
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,355
- No reason.
- If you actually cared

352
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,323
about your sacred oath,
you'd see that he's

353
00:13:57,357 --> 00:13:59,359
a risk to the case.
- [laughs]

354
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:03,763
- Oh, my speech didn't actually
inspire you, did it?

355
00:14:03,796 --> 00:14:06,399
- Ugh, all right,
here's the truth.

356
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,634
If we catch Flaco,
and C.J. gets credit for it,

357
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:11,237
he's gonna transfer
out of the Nine-Nine.

358
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:12,505
- That's what this is all about?
You're still trying

359
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:14,407
to undermine the man?
- What? No!

360
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,476
The opposite, if anything.
I want to see him succeed.

361
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:19,079
I'm trying to overmine him.
- Oh, you know I hate it

362
00:14:19,112 --> 00:14:20,680
when you make up words, Peralta.
- Are you still mad at me

363
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:22,382
for saying "snaccident"?
- Yes, very.

364
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:23,516
- Please, just
let him come along.

365
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:24,517
- No.
- Just so his name

366
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,718
is on the arrest report.
- No.

367
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,420
- I'll put him
in a car a block away.

368
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:31,557
- Fine.
At least tell me what it was

369
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,359
about my speech that
didn't work for you.

370
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:35,061
- [sighs]
Oh, man, if I had to

371
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:37,063
boil it down to one thing
and really pinpoint it,

372
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:39,365
I guess I would just
say it's, uh, ya boring.

373
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,401
But still
let him come? Great.

374
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:43,703
[hissing]
- What is all this?

375
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:46,639
- Oh, hey, Sarge.
I'm growing tropical plants now

376
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:49,442
in the warmth
of my three space heaters.

377
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:51,377
It's getting a little hot
though, wouldn't you say?

378
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,812
[hissing]
Ugh, oh, yeah.

379
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:56,316
Probably also turn on my
portable air conditioning unit.

380
00:14:56,349 --> 00:14:57,417
Boop.
- You're not gonna

381
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,620
beat me, Gina.
This is my last stand.

382
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:04,757
- My whole life is last stands.
- Gina, can I talk to you

383
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,359
for a second?
- Yeah, what's up?

384
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,330
Let me guess, you and Jake
are having problems;

385
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:11,531
you want me to
teach you how to kiss?

386
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:13,466
- What? No, stop that.
- Oh.

387
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:15,368
- I know how I kiss,
I've read books.

388
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:16,836
This is about Terry.
You can't tell

389
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:18,838
anyone else this, but—
- He failed his

390
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:20,640
lieutenant's exam.
- How do you know that?

391
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:22,308
- Let's just say
my little birds

392
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:24,710
are everywhere
collecting whispers.

393
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:26,546
He left the letter
on his desk, and I read it.

394
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,648
- Okay, but if you know
he's depressed, then why

395
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:30,383
are you being so hard on him?
- Don't worry,

396
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,485
I got this.
Just clear the lane

397
00:15:32,518 --> 00:15:36,456
and let Gina do her thing.
- What? Ugh.

398
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:39,325
[rattling]
Gina? You locked me in.

399
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:41,327
- Going to lunch.

400
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,729
- Gina, you know
I'm very claustrophobic.

401
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:46,632
- Everybody ready?
Where's C.J.?

402
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,135
- Parked a block away
on Winthrop, as promised.

403
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:50,470
Don't worry,
he's not going anywhere.

404
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:52,138
I downloaded an app
on his phone that makes

405
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:54,574
your words sound like burps.
- Smart, really smart.

406
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,476
- Yeah.
- Here we go, on three,

407
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:59,479
two, one.
[crash]

408
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:02,415
- NYPD, on the ground.
- On the ground!

409
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:05,485
- Flaco, run!
- That's Flaco.

410
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:07,820
[exclaiming]
[slam]

411
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:10,423
[exclaiming]

412
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:11,891
It's locked, go back.

413
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:15,127
- [panting]

414
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:18,898
[crash]
[panting]

415
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:21,201
[smack]
[grunts]

416
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:24,737
- Oh, sorry.
- C.J., that's Flaco.

417
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,206
You got him.
- Yeah!

418
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,208
- He's out cold,
how'd you do it?

419
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:29,909
- No, no, wait.
Let me guess.

420
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,377
- You opened your
car door into him.

421
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:32,545
- Yep.
- He never saw it coming.

422
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:33,713
- Yep.
- And neither did you.

423
00:16:33,746 --> 00:16:35,215
It was a total accident;
you were getting out

424
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:36,816
of your car to go pee.
- No!

425
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:38,684
There was a spider in the car,
and I panicked.

426
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:40,386
- Damn it, how did I
not guess that?

427
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,388
- You gotta see this spider.
It's gigantic.

428
00:16:42,422 --> 00:16:45,391
[bubbling]
- Charles, this is amazing.

429
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,860
- I know, when's the last time
you cried like that?

430
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:49,962
- Huh? You cried?
- Damn right, I did.

431
00:16:49,995 --> 00:16:52,965
- Oh, guess we gotta get back
to the Nine-Nine.

432
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:55,735
- Let's not be hasty.
Neither of us have any

433
00:16:55,768 --> 00:17:00,640
open cases right now,
so should we tell the ladies

434
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:02,708
we're ready for round two?
- Let's do it,

435
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:05,611
you insatiable little minx.
- I'll go get 'em.

436
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:06,679
- Mmm.

437
00:17:08,448 --> 00:17:12,452
[dramatic music]
[whirring]

438
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:13,886
- Charles, this place
is a front,

439
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,821
money laundering or something.
- We gotta get out

440
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:17,223
of here right now.

441
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,090
- I just got off the phone

442
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,226
with One Police Plaza.
They're thrilled.

443
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,994
Captain Stentley,
you got your transfer.

444
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:23,229
- Whoo!
- I'm not transferring.

445
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,830
- What, why?
- The whole reason

446
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:26,432
I wanted to transfer
in the first place

447
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:28,501
is because I didn't feel like
I could do this job,

448
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:31,571
but the mission tonight,
me taking down Flaco...

449
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:33,439
- More the door than you.
- It just showed me

450
00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:35,908
that I can do this,
and now I feel like

451
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:36,976
I really do belong here.

452
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:40,446
So thank you, guys, for—

453
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,914
for making me
believe in myself again.

454
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:45,451
- Oh.
- Come here.

455
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:46,552
- That's gonna leave a mark.

456
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:49,989
- I can't believe this.

457
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:51,657
Not only are we still
stuck on the night shift,

458
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:53,959
but now we have to
watch C.J. get a medal.

459
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:56,362
Why are there so many reporters?
Even "The Times" is here.

460
00:17:56,396 --> 00:17:58,664
- Wait, really?
Who'd they send?

461
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:02,335
Wilson, Palmer, Schneier,
Levine, Rogers, Tyler, Baker,

462
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:04,637
Correal, Bromwich,
Robbins, Schmidt?

463
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,739
- Stop saying reporters' names.
How do you know so many names?

464
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:08,908
- They're the only real
rock stars we have left.

465
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,175
- Okay.
- Hello, we're here today

466
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:13,679
to honor Captain Jason Stentley,
who single-handedly brought down

467
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,548
a major drug ring.
[applause]

468
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:17,550
And so it is my pleasure
to bestow upon him

469
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:20,019
the Medal of Honor.
Captain Stentley.

470
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:22,522
- Oh, bestow me, baby.

471
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,590
Ahh, wow,

472
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:27,059
that's a lot of people.
Uh...

473
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,629
Baba Booey, Cornholio.

474
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:31,964
[laughs]

475
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:34,534
That's it for my prepared
remarks.

476
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,368
Any questions?

477
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,403
- Will taking down
one drug dealer make

478
00:18:37,437 --> 00:18:39,339
a big difference in the
overall level of drugs

479
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:41,374
moving into the city?
- No idea, next?

480
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:42,542
- What's your philosophy
for dealing with

481
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:44,344
international narcotic
supply chains?

482
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:45,745
- Didn't understand
the question, next.

483
00:18:45,778 --> 00:18:48,414
- Why was Flaco targeted
for this operation?

484
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:50,783
- Okay, there's a question
I can answer.

485
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:55,388
- Well, it all started because
I lost a huge bag of cocaine,

486
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:57,390
so I totally biffed it,
you know, but—

487
00:18:57,423 --> 00:18:58,591
- Thank you, thank you, Captain.
- Oh, oh.

488
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:01,661
- That—That is... That's plenty.
- That was a train wreck.

489
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:03,729
- Yes, he never should have been
put in that position.

490
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:06,432
Whoever recommended him
for the medal and called

491
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:10,002
all those reporters
really messed up.

492
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:12,071
- Wait, what are you saying?
- Oh, nothing.

493
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:16,576
It just seems as if C.J.
has been... overmined.

494
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:17,777
- You did this?
- I did.

495
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,046
- And you used my made-up word.
- I hated it, "overmined."

496
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,416
What have I become?
Was this whole thing

497
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:25,685
even worth it?
- It was no snaccident.

498
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:30,590
- So the foot massage place
reported $7 million

499
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,124
in profit last year.
To make that much,

500
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:35,595
they'd have to massage 100 feet
an hour, 24 hours a day,

501
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:37,697
7 days a week
for the entire year.

502
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,098
- Damn it, we have to
shut them down.

503
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:41,634
- Wait.
Let's not be hasty about this.

504
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:43,636
Let's think this through.
We wanna be smart about this.

505
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:46,038
- Right, I mean, what if we
bust them tonight,

506
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:48,408
and then tomorrow
I'm chasing a murderer,

507
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:49,809
and I'm about to get him,
and my foot cramps up?

508
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:51,577
- Due to lack of massaging.
- And then the murderer

509
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:53,579
gets away.
- Know who he kills next?

510
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:54,780
The mayor.
- Oh, my God, the city

511
00:19:54,814 --> 00:19:55,715
has no mayor now.
- It's chaos.

512
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:57,650
Rioting, looting,
panic in the streets.

513
00:19:57,683 --> 00:19:58,718
- They gotta call in
the National Guard, there's

514
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:01,421
tanks rolling down 5th Avenue,
declaring martial law.

515
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:02,588
- It's insane.
All because we shut down

516
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:05,057
the foot massage place...
- That was doing God's work.

517
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,759
What were we thinking.
- So it's agreed:

518
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,562
we let them stay open
for the sake of the city.

519
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:10,830
- For the sake of the city.

520
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:14,534
- We have to do
our stupid jobs, don't we?

521
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,836
- Yeah, let me get
my stupid gun.

522
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:19,071
- NYPD, get down on the
comfortable matted floor.

523
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:20,706
- Put your magical hands
where we can see them.

524
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,708
- You're under arrest for
ruining something perfect.

525
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:23,709
- And money laundering.

526
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:24,844
- Yes, money laundering,
whatever.

527
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:28,514
- Gina, I've been thinking
a lot about how you refuse

528
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:30,416
to give up Jacinta.
- That's right.

529
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,552
She's never leaving.
- I know, which is why

530
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:34,520
I decided to do
the only fair thing.

531
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:37,657
Space heaters for everyone.
- So what? That sounds great.

532
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,693
- Everyone.
- Whoo-whee,

533
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:43,529
it's toasty in here.
- You're gonna be

534
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:44,797
looking at that all night long.

535
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,898
Whoop, I think he's

536
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:49,802
about to eat a hoagie.
Is that mayonnaise or sweat?

537
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:52,738
- Ugh, fine, I give up.
You can take Jacinta.

538
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:54,674
- Really? And the other
two space heaters, too?

539
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:56,676
- [sighs]
All of them, you win.

540
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:59,211
- I win?
I won.

541
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:01,681
Amy, I won!
- You did it, Sarge.

542
00:21:01,714 --> 00:21:02,915
You're gonna get
our power usage down.

543
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:06,752
- I don't care about that crap.
I took down Gina Linetti.

544
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:10,790
I did the impossible.
Terry is back on top.

545
00:21:10,823 --> 00:21:13,926
Diaper up! What!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

546
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:17,497
Captain Jason Stentley has been
transferred from active duty

547
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,699
effective immediately.
Captain Raymond Holt

548
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:23,235
will be taking his place,
and, yes, he's taking

549
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:24,604
all of us with him.
- You mean—

550
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:26,839
- Yes, Amy.
We're back on the day shift!

551
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:29,609
- Nine-Nine!
all: Nine-Nine!

552
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:31,677
♪ Come on and party tonight!

553
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:32,878
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
