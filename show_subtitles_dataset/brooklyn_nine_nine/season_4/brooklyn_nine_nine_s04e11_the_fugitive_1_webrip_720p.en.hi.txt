Doesn't matter. Either way,
you screwed up big time.

151
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:13,704
of a Kenyan human rights
activist, Abdala,

152
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:17,341
and I realized he and I
are the only two people

153
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:19,443
that can save the world.

154
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:20,744
I'm so excited.

155
00:05:23,847 --> 00:05:26,049

there are only two witnesses

156

to the crash to see something.

One's on his way here already.

00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,488
His name is Marshawn Lynch.

It just says here

- Retired.

164

We're not getting anything
out of him.

165
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:42,533
He's always getting fined for
refusing to talk to the press.

Ugh, he's kind of
one of my heroes.

and it may take a while,

but I'm sure we'll get him
to open up.

169

you just can't open.

175
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:03,520
my mama used to make this, uh,

176
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:05,356
she used to call it
"fo' cheese."

177
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:06,890
What y'all call it?
Y'all call it "four"?

178
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:09,460
How come they never make
quesadillas with sausage?

179
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,595
You throw some tomato sauce
in there

180
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:13,497
and call it a pizza-dilla—
what you think?

181
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,765
- What is going on?

182
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,833
- This one time,
I tried to wait up all night

183
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:18,535
to catch Santa Claus, right?

184
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:19,470
You know how they tell you

185
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,104
you got to put the cookies
and the milk out?

186
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:22,606
I don't really be
telling nobody this,

187
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,541
but I like to sleep
with the fan on,

188
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:25,942
even when it's chilly outside.

189
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:27,511
All about that white noise,
baby.

190
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:29,946
- Stop.
Stop talking, Marshawn Lynch.

191
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,549
Did you see anything
after the van crashed?

192
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,418
Yes or no?

193
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,720
- Nope. Like I told you,
I was just eating my quesadilla.

194
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:38,855
Have I talked to y'all
about my pizza-dilla invention?

195
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,693
- Yes, well, I have
other matters to attend to.

196
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:46,497
So, Detective Diaz,
just take down everything

197
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,931
Mr. Lynch has to say.

198
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:49,566
- Captain—
[door shuts]

199
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:53,637
- You think he'll let me
shoot his gun?

200
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,372
- Jake, look.

201
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:56,440
You think it's our guys?

202
00:06:56,473 --> 00:06:57,641
- Maybe.
But this is New York,

203
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:00,477
so there's a very strong chance
it's just "city blood."

204
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,349
NYPD! Freeze!
- Freeze!

205
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:11,688
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the precinct

206
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:15,792
escaped convict number one!

207
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:16,760
Terry, where's the music?
That was the cue.

208
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,862
- I didn't have that Queen song
on my phone.

209
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:20,864
I wasn't gonna pay $1.99 for it.

210
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:22,666
- Nice work, man. You can
put your perp in holding

211
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:23,800
with the other three convicts.

212
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:24,935
- Wait. Other three?
- Yeah.

213
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:26,570
Santiago and Boyle
brought them in.

214
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,572
- That's right.
It's three to one.

215
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:30,407
Guess you won't be needing this
anymore

216
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,842
since you'll be moving in
with me.

217
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,577
- My towel.
- Yeah, your towel.

218
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:39,516
Why won't it burn?

219
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,951
- Because it never fully dries.

220
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,386
The towel lives,
and so do we!

221
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:45,856
- Hey, Santiago,
how did you guys

222
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:46,957
catch three perps so quickly?

223
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,492
They weren't even close
to each other.

224
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,461
- Given the magnitude
of the situation,

225
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:53,530
we were given full access to any
and all department resources.

226
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:56,166
That's right.
We took a little trip

227
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,002
down to the tactical supply
armory.

228
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:00,437
- No, you did not!

229
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:02,138
- Thermal imaging, baby.

230
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:03,574
- Thermal imaging baby?

231
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,141
- Very handy
in fugitive hunting.

232
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,877
- Also...

233
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,780
I got this Flo-Tech
performance polo

234
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:11,615
with moisture-wicking
technology.

235
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:12,849
Kept me dry all morning.

236
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,952
And a dry is a smart boy.

237
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:17,821
- Ugh, he keeps saying that.

238
00:08:17,854 --> 00:08:19,155
Charles, you've gotten
negative reactions

239
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:20,591
from everyone who's heard it.

240
00:08:20,624 --> 00:08:21,825
- I needed to see
what Jake thought.

241
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:23,494
- Oh, I hated it.
- Really?

242
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,530
- Anyway, gentlemen, we are off
to catch some more convicts.

243
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,198
Two more, and we win.

244
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:29,199
- Huh, just two?

245
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:30,567
[scoffs]
No sweat.

246
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:31,902
Literally.

247
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:34,137
- Get out of here. Take those
glass cutters with you.

248
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,907
- Oh, these lil' ol' things?

249
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,808
Tsst.
- What?

250
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,010
- Why'd you put your finger
in the middle?

251
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:42,045
- Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
I was wondering if you could

252
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:43,514
answer some questions
about the car accident

253
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:44,581
you witnessed this morning.

254
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:47,851
- [speaking foreign language}

255
00:08:47,884 --> 00:08:49,019
- What's she trying to tell us?
- I don't know.

256
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:50,487
Probably
"Never meet your heroes,

257
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:51,922
'cause they're gonna turn out
to be friendly."

258
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:52,956
- You need to get over this

259
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,925
Marshawn Lynch situation
real quick.

260
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,092
Now, we just have to
figure out

261
00:08:57,227 --> 00:08:57,961
what language she's speaking
so we can find a translator.

262
00:08:58,228 --> 00:08:59,563
Here, ma'am.

263
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:02,533
Take a look
at this map of the world.

264
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:04,568
- You just keep one of those
on you?

265
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,537
- Of course. In case
I ever need to prove my point

266
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,538
in an argument.

267
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:09,840
Laos.
- Fine!

268
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:11,842
- Oh, it was better
than fine.

269
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,143
It was Laos.

270
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:15,546
- Mm.
- So, where are you from?

271
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:17,914
- Where did you grow up?

272
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:22,285
- [speaking slowly]
Where were you born?

273
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:23,520
- What are you miming there,
sir?

274
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:24,955
- A child tying his tie.

275
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,558
Uh-huh. I'm trying to do
a simple Half Windsor

276
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:29,125
so she knows I'm a baby.

277
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:32,963
Look at this.
See how basic this knot is?

278
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:35,231
- I love
these thermal goggles.

279
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:37,233
- Amy, listen to me
very carefully.

280
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,035
If you and Jake are thinking
of trying,

281
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:40,704
you are ovulating like crazy
right now.

282
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:43,106
- You take that helmet off
before I knock it off.

283
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,308
- What? Your basal temperature
is off the charts.

284
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,643
This is a good thing.

285
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:47,911
- [whispers] Boyle!

286
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:52,716
NYPD! Get down!

287
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,084
- Freeze!

288
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:58,589
Aah! The room's hot.
I'm blowing out.

289
00:09:58,622 --> 00:09:59,990
- This way. Come on.

290
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:05,061
Oh, come on! Where did you guys
even come from?

291
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:07,263
[horn honks]
- Your nightmares.

292
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:10,266
Hey, Amy, allow me to introduce
you to Big Bertha.

293
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,169
- Okay, I guess I'm not worth
introducing to your truck.

294
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:17,173
- That's right, y'all.
We went to Homeland Security.

295
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:20,043
Yep, this beauty comes fully
equipped with thermal imaging,

296
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:22,045
a satellite link-up,
and she plugs in

297
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:23,714
to every surveillance camera
in the city.

298
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,582
- And she's also got
a holding cell,

299
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,183
which is big enough
for three perps.

300
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:29,953
Jake, counting this guy,
how many perps have we caught

301
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:31,588
and placed
in the three-perp perp cell?

302
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:33,023
- Well, Sarge,
we've placed three perps

303
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:33,890
in the three-perp perp cell.

304
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,592
- So, the three-perp perp cell's
full?

305
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:36,693
- Full of three perps
is the three-perp perp cell.

306
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,029
- Okay, stop saying "perps"
and "cell" and "three."

307
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:40,697
- You sound irritated.
What's the score now?

308
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:43,266
Are you guys still ahead?
Let me just check.

309
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:45,235
Oh, drone!
Little help?

310
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,203
[drone buzzing]

311
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:50,273
Yeah, I can't read that score.
What does it say?

312
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,709
Anyway, I'm sure you're tracking
whatever the score is.

313
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,344
All right, thank you, drone.
That'll be all.

314
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:58,214
Whoop!
Didn't see the tree there.

315
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:00,984
Big Bertha has a drone.
That's what's important.

316
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,288
- What are you trying
to tell us?

317
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,990
Is this some kind of a clue?

318
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:08,258
- [speaking foreign language]

319
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,393
- Draw better.
We have no idea what this is.

320
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:13,029
- I think it's a cookie.
- No. It's a pizza.

321
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,398
[together]
[gasp] It's a cookie pizza!

322
00:11:15,431 --> 00:11:17,300
- Another case solved.

323
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,969
- No. Detectives, we—

324
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:21,037
- Shh shh shh.
Let them go.

325
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:25,341
- She's taking us somewhere.
This is good. This is good.

326
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,143
We're gonna crack this, Diaz.

327
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,279
- [speaking foreign language]

328
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:32,382
- Nope. She just needed
to take a dump.

329
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:34,217
- Okay, satellite images showed

330
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,152
one of the two remaining
convicts entered this building.

331
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:38,354
If we catch him, that's five.
I win the bet.

332
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:40,123
Amy moves in with me.
I lord it over her.

333
00:11:40,156 --> 00:11:41,391
She's miserable.
We live happily ever after.

334
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:42,693
It's fool-proof.

335
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:44,227
- There's got to be 30 floors
in this building.

336
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:45,996
It'll take forever
to sweep the whole place.

337
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,297
- Nuh-uh. We can use Big Bertha

338
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:48,531
to tap into the security
cameras.

339
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:51,702
[whirring, beeping]

340
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:54,237
Ohh.
- [laughing]

341
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,273
- Okay. This room is clear,
but check that closet.

342
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:59,409
Man, this is like playing
the coolest video game ever.

343
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,111
My character is Terry.

344
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:03,046
- It's locked.

00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:48,091
Why did you stop?

518
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,259
- I'm done. You win.

519
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,626
- W-what?

520
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:52,728
- I love you. I want to move in
to your apartment.

521
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:54,064
- Really?

522
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:55,265
I love you too.

523
00:17:55,298 --> 00:17:56,732
- Oh, my God,
what a beautiful moment.

524
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:59,135
And, you guys,
Amy's ovulating as we speak!

525
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:00,336
- What?
- Charles!

526
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:02,338
- All right, head to the back.
You're going to jail.

527
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,143
- Hey.

528
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:09,645
I don't get it. Why did you
decide to let me win?

529
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,747
- I don't know.
When we were back there

530
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:13,249
racing through
the Miranda Rights,

531
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:14,750
I just looked over at you
and thought,

532
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:16,286
"You're awesome.

533
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,720
And you're good
at doing things."

534
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:21,291
I mean, sure, I'll miss towel,
but your happiness is worth

535
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:23,159
way more than winning
some stupid bet.

536
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,064
- Are you sure about this?
- Oh, yeah.

537
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:30,333
Your apartment is better than
mine in every way imaginable.

538
00:18:30,366 --> 00:18:31,401
You want to know
what my first thought was

539
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,635
when we dropped into the sewer?

540
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:33,669
"Smells like home."

541
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:34,737
- He's lying, Amy.

542
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:36,606
His first thought was
about the Ninja Turtles.

543
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,208
- Come on, Terry.
We were in a sewer.

544
00:18:39,008 --> 00:18:40,110
He's gon'sta think
about the Turtles.

545
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:41,311
- Yeah, I'm gon'sta, Terry.

546
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:43,179
Quit being such a Malfoy.
- Yeah, Terry.

547
00:18:43,213 --> 00:18:45,181
- Guys, we have a problem.

548
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:46,316
He's not our convict.

549
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:47,850
- What?
The guy in the orange jumpsuit

550
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:49,852
that we found hiding
in the sewer is not our convict?

551
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,221
- He's our van driver.

552
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:52,622
- A man came to me last week.

553
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:54,857
He told me I had to help
Gessilnick escape from jail.

554
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,392
He had pictures of my family.

555
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,760
He said he'd kill them
if I didn't help.

556
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,230
So, I crashed the van,
and Gessilnick took my clothes.

557
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:01,764
- But then where's the guy
we thought was the van driver?

558
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:04,167
- He vanished.
George Gessilnick,

559
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,868
posing as a Department
of Corrections driver,

560
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,170
was taken to the hospital,

561
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:08,471
where he escaped some hours
later.

562
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:10,273
He's highly dangerous,
probably armed,

563
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:11,407
and could be anywhere.

564
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,443
Detective Diaz has
some background information

565
00:19:13,476 --> 00:19:14,444
to help in the search.

566
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,246
- So this is one scary dude.

567
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,480
We don't have
a complete rap sheet on him

568
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:18,881
because he's had
so many aliases,

569
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:21,217
but we know he's killed
at least five people.

570
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:22,752
He's been in the system
since he was 11.

571
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:25,755
That's when he stole $4,000
from his foster family

572
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:27,690
and burned their house down.

573
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:30,793
- Wait a minute.
This is the foster family?

574
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:32,162
- Yeah. Why?
- Did you see

575
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:33,763
who the brother is?

576
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:35,265
I need to get a message
to somebody.

577
00:19:36,532 --> 00:19:37,767
This is very important. Tell him
Jake Peralta wants to see him.

578
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:39,835
I'm not after him.
I just need his help.

579
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:45,408
Hello?

580
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,243
I followed all your rules.

581
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:50,513
I'm unarmed.
I'm not wearing a wire.

582
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:52,782
I came alone. There's no backup.

583
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,820
Come on, man. I need your help
to take down your brother.

584
00:20:01,857 --> 00:20:04,260
Doug Judy.
The Pontiac Bandit.

585
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:05,261
- Hey, baby.

586
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:06,362
Nice legs.

587
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:07,497
Why are you in your boxers?

588
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,765
- So you would know
I'm not wearing a wire.

589
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,334
Your buddy Scott
said I had to.

590
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,403
- Oh, that makes sense.
Scott's a perv.

591
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:15,805
Hey, Scott,
wherever you're watching from,

592
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:16,906
go home!

593
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,508
- Sorry, man.
[footsteps receding]

594
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,775
- So, what's so important?

595
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:21,511
- I'm looking
for your foster brother, George.

596
00:20:22,278 --> 00:20:23,413
- Hate the guy.
Stole from my mom,

597
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:24,480
burned our house down.

598
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,781
Worst of all, he ran off

599
00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:28,318
with my LP of Phil Collins'
"No Jacket Required."

600
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,419
It's my favorite album.

601
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:30,553
Haven't heard it in 20 years.

602
00:20:30,586 --> 00:20:32,555
- I mean,
can't you just stream it?

603
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:35,391
- Can't do that to Phil.
"Sussudio" demands vinyl.

604
00:20:35,425 --> 00:20:37,393
- Right. Vinyl and whatnot.
Okay, well,

605
00:20:37,427 --> 00:20:39,829
George is a murderer now
and he just escaped from prison.

606
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:41,531
We think he might be trying
to flee the country.

607
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:42,498
- You want me to help you
catch him?

608
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,300
Like when X-men teamed up
with Magneto

609
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:45,268
to stop Apocalypse.

610
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:47,303
- I heard that one was bad.
- Wasn't great.

611
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,205
- I still want to see it though.
- I'd watch it again.

612
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,506
- So, does that mean you're in?
- Course I am.

613
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,209
Damn, it feels good
to be on the same team for once.

614
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,778
A cop and a criminal working
together. [gasps]

615
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,447
We need a theme song.

616
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,250
♪ The Pontiac Bandit
and Jake the cop ♪

617
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:01,517
- Oh!
♪ Taking down crooks

618
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,219
♪ In the streets
where they live ♪

619
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:05,521
♪ Flirting with girls
who are hot for the badge ♪

620
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,391
♪ There's a talking police dog
that helps them solve crime ♪

621
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:12,328
- You gave him full immunity?
Are you insane?

622
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,796
- You told me to cut a deal.

623
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:17,233
- I thought you'd maybe drop
charges on one or two felonies.

624
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,502
But do you know how many crimes
we're forgiving?

625
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:21,304
Six—
- That's not so bad.

626
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:23,005
- Hundred!
- Oh, that's way more.

627
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:24,540
- "Grand theft auto.
Grand theft auto.

628
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,476
Grand theft auto.
Dog fraud."

629
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:28,344
- I sold a guy a fake Pekinese.

630
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:29,545
'Twas a cat.

631
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,582
- You will not win me over
with your use of "'twas."

632
00:21:32,615 --> 00:21:34,317
- 'Twasn't trying to.
- [snorts]

633
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,352
- You're clearly friends
with this man,

634
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:38,454
and you've lost
your objectivity, Peralta.

635
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,356
- Or have you lost
your objectivity?

636
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,357
What are you doing?

637
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:42,258
- My bad.
I thought we were leaving.

638
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:44,527
- No. I'm just
making a point here. Sit down.

639
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:46,228
Look, sir.
There's a triple-murderer

640
00:21:47,297 --> 00:21:48,230
loose in Brooklyn, and it's
our job to bring him in,

641
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:50,300
even if that means forgiving
a guy who stole some cars,

642
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:52,368
and, yes,
sold a few cats as dogs.

643
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:53,235
- More than a few.

644
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:54,637
Weird how many people
fell for that.

645
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,306
- Plus, his deal is conditional.

646
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:57,573
If Judy doesn't lead us
to his brother,

647
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,808
he doesn't get immunity.

648
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:00,643
- Look, Cap,
I want to see George behind bars

649
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:01,644
as much as you do.

650
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,045
I hate my brother.

651
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:04,314
- You can relate to that,
right, sir?

652
00:22:04,347 --> 00:22:05,415
Remember how furious you got

653
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,450
that time your sister ended
an email with "thx"

654
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:08,451
instead of "thanks"?

655
00:22:08,484 --> 00:22:09,852
- Why would you bring that up?

656
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:10,986
- It seemed pertinent.
- Fine.

657
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,455
Let's see where this leads.

658
00:22:12,488 --> 00:22:13,423
Dismissed.

659
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,058
- So we don't know
if anybody helped George Judy

660
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:17,327
escape from this hospital.

661
00:22:18,361 --> 00:22:19,028
Security cameras show him
entering this courtyard,

662
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,330
but never coming back out.

663
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:21,331
The dude just vanished.

664
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:23,599
- Ugh. Terry hates hospitals.

665
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,600
They reek of death.

666
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,935
- Ahem.

667
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:27,937
- Oh, not you, ma'am.

668
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,905
You reek of life.

669
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:33,543
Maybe he went up the wall

670
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:34,844
like this.

671
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:37,647
[grunts]

672
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,915
Never mind.
It's not possible.

673
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:41,551
- You sure?

674
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:44,554
[dramatic music]

675
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:47,056
- Damn, Rosa!
How did you do that?

676
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:48,458
- I have a dark past.

677
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:54,096
[cheers and applause]

678
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,565
Now you know my deepest shame.

679
00:22:55,598 --> 00:22:57,567
- Cool.
Well, now that I saw you do it,

680
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,301
I get how to do it too.

681
00:23:02,037 --> 00:23:04,974
[grunts]
- Ooh, damn, Terry.

682
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,709
- Hey, guys.
Guess what.

683
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:08,978
To thank you for being
such good friends,

684
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:10,980
I picked up a big old basket
of muffins.

685
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:11,914
Follow me.

686
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:14,417
- Come on!
- I got all kinds of muffins!

687
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,652
Blueberry muffins,
poppy seed muffins,

688
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,455
banana nut muffins,
chocolate chip—

689
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:21,991
ooh, wait,
there are no muffins.

690
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:22,858
- What's happening now?

691
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:25,027
- How's it feel
being lied to, Huh?

692
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,363
- I mean, I'm okay.
I wasn't really that invested

693
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:28,431
in the muffins.
- I was.

694
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:29,999
- You guys thought you could
keep a secret from me?

695
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:31,534
Well, I know everything.

696
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:34,036
Hitchcock left his phone
in the bathroom again,

697
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:35,638
and guess what I found on it.

698
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:37,540
- I needed the cash.
I didn't know they'd be filming.

699
00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:40,476
- Text chains.
Dozens of text chains.

700
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,445
And I'm not on any of them.

701
00:23:42,478 --> 00:23:44,079
Take a look at this board.

702
00:23:44,113 --> 00:23:47,750
There's an Amy-Gina-Terry-
Hitchcock-Rosa-Jake chain.

703
00:23:47,783 --> 00:23:51,587
There's a Hitchcock-Terry-
Amy-Rosa Chain.

704
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,990
There's even a Hitchcock-Gina-
Scully chain.

705
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:56,258
I mean, what the hell
happens on that?

706
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:59,028
- Well, we mostly just exchange
"Game of Thrones" theories.

707
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:01,030
- The little guy is gonna
marry a dragon.

708
00:24:01,063 --> 00:24:02,031
- We think.

709
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:03,633
- Well, one thing's for sure:

710
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,735
Charles Boyle...

711
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:07,102
is off the chains.

712
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:08,103
- I'm sorry.

713
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:10,940
We only excluded
you because you're kind of...

714
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:12,074
an over-texter.

715
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:14,076
- Over-texter?
That's not even a thing.

716
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:15,978
- Oh really? So you don't
remember the time

717
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:19,081
you sent 97 unanswered texts
in a five-minute span?

718
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:21,183
- My phone vibrated itself
off the desk.

719
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:22,985
I think it was
committing suicide.

720
00:24:23,018 --> 00:24:25,054
- It's okay. This isn't the
first time I've been left out.

721
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:27,990
At camp,
nobody would be friends with me.

722
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:29,258
I had to hang out
with the lunch ladies.

723
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:33,663
After summer ended, they never
replied to any of my letters.

724
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:35,197
- Oh, this is really sad.

725
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,166
There's just no muffins at all.

726
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:39,001
- Kaboom!
- What's this?

727
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,202
- That is the art auction

728
00:24:40,235 --> 00:24:42,472
that George Judy will be robbing
tonight.

729
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:44,173
- Why is it so sticky?
- I was eating sour straws.

730
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:46,208
It's crazy that's what you're
choosing to focus on.

731
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,543
Doug Judy came through for us.

732
00:24:47,577 --> 00:24:48,678
- That's what George is after:

733
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,146
a bejeweled egg
worth $20 million.

734
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,516
- That's a nice egg, but how
do you know he'll be there?

735
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:55,585
- Doug's boy Parker said
he kept asking about the place.

736
00:24:55,618 --> 00:24:57,119
- And what does this Parker do?

737
00:24:57,152 --> 00:24:58,721
- You know, I don't know.
I can't really recall.

738
00:24:58,754 --> 00:25:00,089
Some sort of auto-industry
professional.

739
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:01,724
Maybe, like, a car thief
or some such whatnot.

740
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:04,594
- Oh, I see. So the only thing
we have to go on is

741
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:06,529
the word of one
of your criminal friends?

742
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:08,130
- Criminals?
That's how you see us?

743
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:11,200
Is it a crime to steal bread
to feed your family?

744
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:13,836
Or to sell some weed
so you can buy video games?

745
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:16,238
Or to steal video games
because you smoked all that weed

746
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:18,508
you were supposed to sell?
- Yes, all of those are crimes.

747
00:25:18,541 --> 00:25:21,110
- Damn. Even the bread one?
- Especially the bread one.

748
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:23,546
But since this is the only lead
you have,

749
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:24,313
go do something with it.

750
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:26,081
- Oh, we'll go do something
with it.

751
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:29,018
We'll go do something
with the hell out of it.

752
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:31,253
♪ Woop-woop
that's the sound of da police ♪

753
00:25:31,286 --> 00:25:33,756

755
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,260
- No, no, no.

756
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:39,261
He's not a cop.

757
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:41,130
He can't be wearing
any of this.

758
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:42,197
- It's just a windbreaker.

759
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:44,099
It's not like I gave him
a badge and a gun.

760
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:46,235
Uh, he has both of those things.
- It's not loaded.

761
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:48,604
I just want to cock it
and say a cool cop catch phrase.

762
00:25:48,638 --> 00:25:49,772
[cocks gun]

763
00:25:50,806 --> 00:25:52,575
New York's finest
just got a whole lot finer.

764
00:25:52,608 --> 00:25:53,776
- Give me that.
- [whimpers]

765
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:55,277
- I'm putting myself
on this case.

766
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,212
- All right, Captain.

767
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:59,782
Looks like New York's finest
just got a whole lot—

768
00:25:59,815 --> 00:26:01,250
- Let's go!
- All right.

♪ Woop-woop

770
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:07,857
- Whoo.
Okay.

771
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,259
How do I look? Like I'm about to
buy a bunch of expensive art?

772
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:12,194
- Hell, yeah.
And not just paintings either.

773
00:26:12,227 --> 00:26:14,630
You look statue rich.

774
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:16,131
- I didn't know
we'd have to valet.

775
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,633
Perhaps I shouldn't
have brought Gertie.

776
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:18,734
- Who's Gertie?
- [chuckles]

777
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,003
That foxy little she-devil
we just drove here in.

778
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:22,705
- Gertie? No, man.

779
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:24,874
A car's gotta have a sexy name,
like Brooke,

780
00:26:24,907 --> 00:26:27,109
or Tiffany, or Sandra,
or Candice.

781
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:29,845
- Yeah, or Suzie, or Dana,
or Karen.

782
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,947
Oh, no, wait.
That's my mom's name.

783
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:33,849
Why did I say my mom's name?
- Ugh.

784
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,719
The sight of another man inside
her makes me sick.

785
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:39,021
- Yeah. I dislike
this conversation very much.

786
00:26:39,054 --> 00:26:40,923
- Treat her gently!

787
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:42,858
- You know that's not
a nice car, right?

788
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,059
- Say that again.

789
00:26:44,093 --> 00:26:45,227
- Damn, Cap. Be cool.

790
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,030
- Say that again.

791
00:26:49,198 --> 00:26:51,734
That's what I thought.

792
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:52,768
I'll be in the venue.

793
00:26:54,069 --> 00:26:56,105
- Come on, Boyle.
- What's this about?

794
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:57,940
Look, if you're leading me
to some sort

795
00:26:57,973 --> 00:27:00,710
of big surprise apology
where everyone's there

796
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:03,045
and you all want me to join
your stupid text chains,

797
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:04,246
I am 100% in.

798
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,882
These last 24 hours
have just been hell.

799
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,318
Oh, it's just my former lover.
Hello, sister.

800
00:27:09,351 --> 00:27:11,887
- Ugh, I hate when you say
those things back-to-back.

801
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,689
Here.
- You took my phone?

802
00:27:13,723 --> 00:27:15,725
- Yeah. I had to delete
your GIF keyboard

803
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:18,027
and your three
"Property Brothers" emoji apps.

804
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,929
- Wait. Did you delete them
because...

805
00:27:19,962 --> 00:27:21,931
- Yeah.
You're on the office text chain.

806
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:23,833
- Are you serious?
This is amazing.

807
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:25,200
- Yeah, well I was totally
against it,

808
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:27,937
but Amy felt bad
because you seemed so pathetic.

809
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,938
- Don't say that.
- It worked!

810
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,105
- I mean,
your little camp story.

811
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,141
was the saddest childhood
memory I've ever heard,

812
00:27:33,142 --> 00:27:34,109
and I've listened to Amy
talking about attending

813
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,145
"the crossing guard's jamboree."

814
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:38,113
- That was fun!
We were directing traffic

815
00:27:38,147 --> 00:27:39,248
in the hotel hallways.

816
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:40,950
People were freaking out.

817
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:42,785
- Mm-hmm. Just don't make us
regret this.

818
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:43,886
- I won't.
I swear I won't.

819
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,956
I gotta tell my dad.

820
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:48,290
- I know you weren't
on board with this,

821
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:50,092
but look how happy
we made him.

822
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,994
And at no cost to our...
[phone chimes] oh.

823
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,896
- And here it comes.
- No.

824
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:56,031
That was just one...
[phone chimes] uh-oh.

825
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,867
[phone chiming repeatedly]
I bet he's just getting it

826
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,168
out of his system.
- Oh, yeah.

827
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:00,970
I'm sure he'll be brief.

828
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:03,138
- Apparently the Tsar of Russia
gave that bejeweled egg

829
00:28:03,172 --> 00:28:04,740
to his girlfriend
as a present.

830
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:06,842
I've never gotten a
bejeweled anything. Stupid Amy.

831
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,745
- Well, I highly doubt our
murderer is gonna show up here.

832
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,280
- Doug Judy said he's be here,
and I believe him.

833
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:13,983
- Cap,
got some hors d'oeuvres.

834
00:28:14,016 --> 00:28:15,818
I don't know what you like,
so I guessed:

835
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:17,386
the radishes they put
on the side for decoration?

836
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,989
- Mmm, thank you.
Cut into a flower?

837
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:21,190
Where are we,
Las Vegas?

838
00:28:21,223 --> 00:28:22,925
- Guys, look over there
by the hallway.

839
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:23,959
See the woman in the red?

840
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,061
I think that's my brother's
girlfriend, Fran.

841
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,997
I don't want her
to recognize me.

842
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,965
Does she have a scar
on her left cheek?

843
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,867
- Maybe.
What's the shape of the scar?

844
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:33,402
- Just a general slash shape.
- Oh, darn.

845
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:35,104
I've been reading a lot
of "Harry Potter" lately,

846
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:36,271
and I was hoping
for something more fun.

847
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:38,007
Okay, I'll head towards her.

848
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,177
You go around back in case
she makes a break for it.

849
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,946
She's on the move.

850
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:45,347
Excuse me, ma'am.
Oh.

851
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,317
No, please stop.
- Freeze. NYPD.

852
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,920
- What's going on?
- No scar. It's not Fran.

853
00:28:50,953 --> 00:28:52,187
- Then why was she running?

854
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:54,289
- Because a strange guy started

00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:57,111
I bought it at a used car lot
for, like, $600.

1186
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:59,180
This is not a nice vehicle.
- Yeah, it's not.

1187
00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:01,049
- And by the way,
her name's not Gertie.

1188
00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:03,518
It's Sexarella.

1189
00:41:03,552 --> 00:41:07,188
- Hello, Sexarella.

1190
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:09,591
- So, what's next for you,
Doug Judy?

1191
00:41:09,624 --> 00:41:11,159
- I'm turning over
a new leaf.

1192
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:12,761
Gonna live that honest life.

1193
00:41:12,794 --> 00:41:14,529
Maybe open up a bakery,

1194
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:16,598
buy a little house,
invest in my retirement.

1195
00:41:16,631 --> 00:41:17,832
- You're gonna go back
to stealing cars immediately,

1196
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,200
aren't you?
- That's very much on the table.

1197
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:21,169
Yeah.
- And when you do...

1198
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:22,637
I'll be there to stop you.
- No, you won't.

1199
00:41:22,671 --> 00:41:24,138
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

1200
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:25,840
- Yes, I will.
- I'm gonna miss you, man.

1201
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:28,643
- I'm gonna miss you, brother.
- Good-bye, little Fievel.

1202
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:30,645
- Good-bye, Papa.

1203
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:33,648
[both grunting]

1204
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:34,716
- Cool. All right, peace out.
- Uh-huh.

1205
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:36,818
- It was good to see you.
- Good to see you, man.

1206
00:41:36,851 --> 00:41:38,853
- Hey, you guys,
I thought of a funny response

1207
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,522
to Terry's text from earlier.

1208
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:41,723
Would you mind taking a look
before I hit send?

1209
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,092
- Charles, you've trained
for this moment, okay?

1210
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,627
We trust you.
Just send it.

1211
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,464
Come here.
Good job.

1212
00:41:49,498 --> 00:41:51,800
- All right, I'm gonna do it.
- Mm-hmm.

1213
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,235
[phone chimes]

1214
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:56,437
- Way to go, Cha—

1215
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:01,876
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

1216
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,845
- Fremulon.
