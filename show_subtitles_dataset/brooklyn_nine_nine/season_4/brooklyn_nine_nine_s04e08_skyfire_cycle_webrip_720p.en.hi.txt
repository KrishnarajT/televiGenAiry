There are three doors,

You pick a door.

The prize is behind
one of two doors.

150

It's a 50/50 chance
either way.

151
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:27,070
- It's 2/3 if you switch,
1/3 if you don't.

152
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:28,939
The probability locks in
when you make the choice.

166

Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing

167

so scared I almost left,

168
00:05:57,934 --> 00:06:00,170
but I stayed.
I worked up my courage,

169
00:06:00,203 --> 00:06:02,105
I walked over to him
and I introduced myself,

170
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:04,040
and you know what
he said to me?

171
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:05,075
- "Hey."

172
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,979
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!

173
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:11,748

00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,216
Come on, you're braver
than this.

175
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:16,086
Just tell him how meaningful
the note he wrote you was.

176
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,854
People love knowing that they
changed someone's life.

177
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:18,989
I mean, why do you think
I'm doing this for you?

178
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:20,090
This isn't about me.

179
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:21,157
- No.

180
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:22,726
That was 30 years ago.

181
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,227
He won't remember,
and I'll feel silly.

182
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,129
- Well, we're
about to find out.

183
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,263
Parlov just walked in.

184
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:28,999
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

185
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:30,667
- All right,
just breathe.

186
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,268
Stop fanning your armpits
like that.

187
00:06:32,302 --> 00:06:33,236
Oh, good Lord!
Keep fanning them!

188
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,671
Keep fanning them!
- Oh.

189
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,409
- Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.

190
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,177
- Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious

191
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,445
about why my case
got reassigned.

192
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:43,446
Is there some problem?

193
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,415
- Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted

194
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:47,183
New York's best detective
on it.

195
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:50,887
Allow me to introduce
Mister Sergeant Terry Jeffords.

196
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,325
[chuckles]
Sarge?

197
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:56,259
- [meek voice] Hi.

198
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,328
- Uh-oh. Terry,
you want to come out here

199
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,096
and help me take
Mr. Parlov's statement?

200
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,133
[chuckles]

201
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,935
He usually stands
much taller than that.

202
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:06,737
Anyway, tell us
about these death threats

203
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,438
you've been getting. Any idea
who might be sending them?

204
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,173
- Well, I'm pretty sure
that it had to be a fan.

205
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:11,775
I've had a little bit
of a backlash

206
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,476
from some of my younger
male readers

207
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:14,510
ever since I revealed
the fact

208
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:17,480
that Qwandor the dragon
is actually a female.

209
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:19,349
- I would think teen boys
would love a lady dragon,

210
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:21,317
Did you give her
big, scaly boobs, or—

211
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,418
I don't know,
you're the writer.

212
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:24,154
- Qwandor is not
a sexual being.

213
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:27,323
- For she is the ender
of bloodlines.

214
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:30,727
All mortals tremble
before her wrath.

215
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:33,363
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.

216
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:35,498
Whoever wrote this
has got nothing on me.

217
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,433
- Uh, he's not a killer.
[laughs]

218
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:38,434
Tell him
about the inscription.

219
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:41,371
- You probably don't remember,
but 30 years ago,

220
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:44,207
I wrote you a letter telling you
how lonely and sad I was,

221
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,842
and you sent me a book
with the inscription,

222
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:49,379
"We all write our own stories,"
and it changed my life.

223
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:51,347
- I do remember you.
- You do?

224
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:54,818
- I do indeed, and I'm delighted
you made something of yourself.

225
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:57,353
As the Cloud Rock says—

226
00:07:57,387 --> 00:07:59,856
both: "You found yourself
in your struggle."

227
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,757
- Wow.

228
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,959
both: "The truth is
what you came for,

229
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:06,262
and you found it
within your strife."

230
00:08:06,296 --> 00:08:07,864
- Well, that was cool.

231
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:10,366
both: "Be brave for Tolgan."
- There's more.

232
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,438
both: "Tolgan the last,
Tolgan the first, Tolgan."

233
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:17,273
- "Tolgan."

234
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:18,108
Is it over?

235
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,177
- Yes.
This is the best day of my life.

236
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:22,178
- You have three kids,
Terry.

237
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:23,246
- I said what I said!

238
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,280
- All right.

239
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,249
- [laughs]

240
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,018
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!

241
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,019
- Up high.

242
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,020
- Down low.

243
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:31,087
both:
Butts! Butts! Butts!

244
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:33,556
- Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?

245
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:34,557
- Oh.
both: Mervyn's.

246
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,526
- Oh.
[both laughing]

247
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,528
- Gina, get your rear
over here.

248
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,196
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.

249
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:42,265
- Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.

250
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,334
- Yeah, I just wanted
to get to know Sam better,

251
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,402
and talk about
the upcoming vacation.

252
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:47,437
I got him his favorite—

253
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,240
egg salad on white,
bowl of cottage cheese...

254
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:52,308
both:
Hard boiled egg on the side.

255
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:53,343
- Oh, no.

256
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:54,477
- Oh, yes.

257
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,348
Turns out Sam here also thinks
we should go to Aruba.

258
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,916
- N—I know
it sounds crazy,

259
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,253
but the Caribbean might be
more fun than Iowa.

260
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:04,821
- In what universe?

261
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:06,556
- I'd tell you to pack
sunscreen, but—

262
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,359
Mm, looks like
you already got burned.

263
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:10,593
- Uh-oh, did I?

264
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,029
'Cause my skin still tastes
pretty raw.

265
00:09:13,063 --> 00:09:14,464
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.

266
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:15,899
- 13-2, Iowa.

267
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:19,335
- For now,
but I have a whole day

268
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:21,972
of Boyle cousins scheduled,
starting with Bobby Boyle

269
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:25,041
at 3:00
for afternoon eggs.

270
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:27,477
- You think you can
pick us off one-by-one?

271
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,946
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.

272
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,982
Boyles are very weak
as individuals.

273
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:34,617
But, together,
we're unbreakable.

274
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,352
I'm calling a council
of the cousins!

275
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:39,355
- [groans] I'm scared!
Just kidding. Come on, Sam.

276
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:40,556
- Sam, stay.

277
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,558
- Sam, come. [whistles]
- Sam, stay.

278
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:43,626
- Come on, Sam.

279
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:45,495
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.

280
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:46,997
Come on.
- Stay.

281
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,531
- Come.
- [clicks tongue] Stay.

282
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:50,867
- All right,
let's get on this case.

283
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:52,335
I can't let my hero die.

284
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:55,071
- Great. Parlov is in town
for a reading of his new book,

285
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:57,607
"The Skyfire Cycle:
A Bridge to Jarcata."

286
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,044
- Ah, ah. It's actually
pronounced "Jarca-a."

287
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:02,879
All the T's in "Skyfire"
are silent.

288
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:04,380
- This book sounds
impossible to read.

289
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:05,481
- [laughs]
I know, right?

290
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,417
- Okay. All the death threats
were sent from New York,

291
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,085
so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike

292
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:10,053
at the book reading
tomorrow night.

293
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,888
- And he's probably
camped out on the street

294
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:13,123
with the other fan boys.

295
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:14,524
They've been lined up
for three days.

296
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:16,626
- To listen to an old man
read a story?

297
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,593
I will never understand
this world.

298
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:19,495
- You once took a train
to Toronto to get

299
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:21,397
a Canadian VHS copy
of "Die Hard."

300
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:22,966
- There was a rumor it was
better sound quality.

301
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:24,134
Get a grip, Terry.

302
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,903
- We just need a way to compare
the fans' handwriting

303
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:29,005
to the death threats.

304
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,141
Oh!
We get them to sign a petition

305
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:32,608
to make Qwandor the dragon
a male.

306
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:34,444
- Ooh, "smorf."

307
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:36,346
But are we going to fit in there
dressed like this?

308
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,581
- No.
No, we're not.

309
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:39,682
[Bone Crusher's "Never Scared']

310
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,417
♪ Yeah

311
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:44,020
♪ So I'm outside of da club

312
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:48,124
♪ And you think
I'm a punk ♪

313
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:52,128
- Sign our petition to make
Qwandor the dragon a male!

314
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,964
- There are already
enough girl characters.

315
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:55,631
We don't need a third!

316
00:10:58,134 --> 00:10:59,135
- Good evening, sir.

317
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:00,536
- No, it's not.
I haven't slept,

318
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,505
because I've been
going over that stupid problem.

319
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,540
Now I finally understand
Kevin's side.

320
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:06,009
- Cool, so it's all better

321
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,443
and I never have to hear
about math again?

322
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:08,378
- Quite the opposite.

323
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:11,014
I know better than ever
how incorrect he is.

324
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,482
- Probability doesn't kick in.

325
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:14,450
Do I have to teach you
college level statistics?

326
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:15,551
- I don't know,
do I have to teach you

327
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:16,552
high school statistics?

328
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:18,588
- Do I have to teach you
eighth grade statistics?

329
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:20,590
- Do I have to teach you
seventh grade statistics?

330
00:11:20,623 --> 00:11:21,757
- Do I have to teach you—

331
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,693
Now, if you'll excuse me,
detectives, I need to leave him

332
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:27,063
a snide voicemail
about kindergarten statistics.

333
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:28,731
- [sighs]

334
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:31,501
Okay, we have got to explain
this thing to Captain Holt

335
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,136
to save
their relationship.

336
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,204
And you laughed at me
when I went

337
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,139
to that
weekend-long math conference.

338
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:37,407
- 'Cause you called it
"funky cats

339
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,574
and their feisty stats."

340
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:40,610
- That was the name!
It was so cool.

341
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:42,512
- It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.

342
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:44,214
They haven't seen each other
because of the night shift.

343
00:11:44,247 --> 00:11:45,081
They just need to bone.

344
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:48,451
- What? Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!

345
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:50,120
I mean—[chuckles]
That's not what I think.

346
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:52,022
Captain Dad is just my boss.
- Wow.

347
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:55,025
- Never mind, I'm teaching
father the math!

348
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:57,127
Whatever, Rosa.

349
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,294
- To be honest, Terry,
I'm feeling

350
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:00,130
a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword,

351
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:02,098
and I'm wearing what,
a potato sack?

352
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:03,633
- You're my noble squire.

353
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,468
You should be thankful
for that burlap,

354
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:07,403
it's hiding your terrible
failed castration.

355
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:08,538
- Oh, my God,
I hate these books.

356
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:11,041
- Are you the guys passing out
the Qwandor petition?

357
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:12,508
- Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.

358
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:14,044
- You bet they do.

359
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:16,246
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just

360
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,648
that women aren't
strong enough to be dragons.

361
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,750
Now, handeth me
yon "petish."

362
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,552
- Okay.

363
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:23,486
"Petish" handeth yon'd.

364
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,122
- This is a start,
but if you really want

365
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:28,524
Parlov to hear you,

366
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:30,626
you're gonna have to send
a message in blood.

367
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,731
- I think we've got
a suspect.

368
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:36,732
Let's ride.

369
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:39,535
Whoa, that's very heavy.
[grunts]

370
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,604
Halitosis Frodo's got to be
our guy, right?

371
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,638
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:45,208
"A message in blood"
is a reference to book one.

373
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:46,742
Page 843.

374
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:49,679
After Wendivil betrayed
Prince Clevang, murdered him,

375
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:51,781
and used his blood to write
letters to his children.

376
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,749
- Do you talk about this stuff
with Sharon?

377
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:54,784
- No. She hates it.

378
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:55,651
- Yeah, makes sense.

379
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:57,753
- Uh, This writing
doesn't match up.

380
00:12:57,787 --> 00:12:59,189
I'm gonna send it
to the lab anyway.

381
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:00,656
- Yeah, I don't think
that's necessary.

382
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,491
- Why not?

383
00:13:01,524 --> 00:13:04,660
- Because I just found
a perfect match.

384
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:07,730
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.

385
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:09,499
- Terry did not
see that coming.

386
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:15,171
- And that is a perfect match.

387
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:16,339
- This is crazy.

388
00:13:16,372 --> 00:13:18,608
Why would Parlov
send himself a death threat?

389
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,643
- For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.

390
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,178
His book is on
the best-seller list

391
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:23,279
for the first time in years.

392
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:24,614
- Parlov doesn't need
any help.

393
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:26,549
He's already famous, rich.

394
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:27,650
He's got more babes
than he can handle.

395
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,385
- Come on, that guy?

396
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,287
Now you're just lying
to prove a point.

397
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,256
- He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.

398
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:35,225
- Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.

399
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,227
It can be disappointing
to meet your hero.

400
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,428
I mean, just like me
and Patrick Ewing.

401
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:41,364
- You said that went great.
- I lied. It was a disaster.

402
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,499
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing,
my name is Jake Per—

403
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,235
Oh, no!
- Wha—

404
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:47,370
Hey!
- You're my favorite player.

405
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:50,240
- You pantsing Patrick Ewing
has nothing to do with this.

406
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:52,508
- It doesn't? Oh, my God,
why did I share that story?

407
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,345
- There is no way Parlov
sent himself that death threat.

408
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:57,247
Look, we are gonna
go to his hotel,

409
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,382
we're gonna talk to him,
and he'll have an explanation.

410
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:01,384
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!

411
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,486
I'm sorry, I thought
you were gonna disagree.

412
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,289
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.

413
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:08,191
- [sighs, blows raspberries]

414
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:10,193
- Is everything okay,
Santiago?

415
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:13,196
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?

416
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,431
- Actually...

417
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:17,633
it's behind one of these
three doors.

418
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,235
Why don't you pick one?

419
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:21,504
- Are you trying
to Monty Hall me?

420
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:23,239
It's unbelievable.

421
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:25,508
I don't need Monty Hall
ruining my place of work

422
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,178
when Monty Hall has already
ruined my home life.

423
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:30,213
- Come on, sir, the math thing
isn't the problem.

424
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:31,547
Night shift's keeping you
and Kevin apart.

425
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:33,283
You two just need to bone.
- [chuckles nervously]

426
00:14:33,316 --> 00:14:35,285
- What did you say?
- Don't say it again.

427
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:37,353
- I said you two need to bone.
- [whimpers]

428
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:42,292
- How... dare you,
Detective Diaz.

429
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:44,627
I am your superior officer!

430
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,429
[shouting]
Bone!

431
00:14:46,462 --> 00:14:48,264
[sternly] What happens
in my bedroom, Detective,

432
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:50,266
is none of your business.

433
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,534
[shouting]
Bone?

434
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:54,337
[calmly] Don't ever speak to me
like that again.

435
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:58,641
- Why did you do that?

436
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:00,443
- Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.

437
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:01,677
Problem solved.

438
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:05,648
- The council of the cousins.

439
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:08,651
- Look at them.
It's like a Beige of Pigs.

440
00:15:08,684 --> 00:15:10,486
- Gina, you seem rattled.

441
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,854
You don't normally make puns.

442
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:14,324
- That's a pun?
On what?

443
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:16,592
Listen, Charles,
I'm gonna sway the council.

444
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:19,429
So give up now unless you enjoy
being humiliated

445
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,863
in front of your family.
- Oh,

446
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,665
you think I'd be embarrassed
in front of them?

447
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:26,536
In front of Don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.

448
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:29,605
And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.

449
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,541
- Hello, cousins.

450
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:33,343
Bobby, Brendan, Bill,

451
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:35,478
Bernard, boy Corey,
girl Corey.

452
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:40,283
Papa Boyle once said:
"Stay in the middle.

453
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:41,717
"That's where it's safe.

454
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:43,253
"That's where we thrive.

455
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:45,355
That's... Iowa."

456
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:48,358
- Charles will tell you
believe that Aruba

457
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:51,861
isn't for the Boyles,
but picture this:

458
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:55,265
one long banana boat
with the 15 of us on it,

459
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:57,300
holding each other
by the waist,

460
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,370
having the time
of our damn lives.

461
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:02,605
- Do we really wanna go where
"Pirates of the Caribbean"

462
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:03,906
took place?
- Yes!

463
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,276
[cheers and applause]
- No!

464
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:07,710
That movie gave us
nightmares for moths!

465
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:09,445
[crowd groans]

466
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,581
- Y'all know I got y'all
aqua socks!

467
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:14,417
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.

468
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,388
- In conclusion,
Boyles are nothing if not loyal.

469
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:21,891
Loyal to our favorite brand
of peanut butter, Mr. Nuts.

470
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:25,661
Loyal to each other
and loyal to Iowa.

471
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:28,298
I love you.
all: I love you.

472
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:31,867
- I'm Gina Linetti,
and I approve this message.

473
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:33,869
[laughs]
I love you.

474
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:35,605
all: I love you.

475
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:39,509
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.

476
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,611
I think we'll sleep on it
and we'll vote in the morning.

477
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:43,679
Council adjourned.

478
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:45,915
I love you.
all: I love you.

479
00:16:45,948 --> 00:16:47,350
[knocking at the door]

480
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:49,785
- Hey.

481
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:50,786
- What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry,

482
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,754
I'm a little busy
right now.

483
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:53,789
I've some female companions
over, you know.

484
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:54,857
- Oh, really?
What are they,

485
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,627
like, some nerdy sci-fi fans,
or—

486
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,462
Good Lord!

487
00:16:59,495 --> 00:17:00,663
I don't know
what I'm looking at.

488
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:04,334
- I told you, man, he pulls.
He pu-u-ulls.

489
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:05,901
- Okay, stop saying "pulls."

490
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:07,703
Mr. Parlov, we have to
talk to you.

491
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:09,705
- Now, we're not accusing you
of anything.

492
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:11,441
We just want to ask
a few questions.

493
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:13,343
You know,
we're probably wrong.

494
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:14,877
We should just go.
- Sarge, no.

495
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,911
God, you're strong!

496
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:17,713
Mr. Parlov,
did you send yourself

497
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:19,349
those death threats
for publicity?

498
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:20,350
- Are you kidding me?

499
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,717
I have no need
for publicity.

500
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:22,918
- The handwriting
in the death threats

501
00:17:22,952 --> 00:17:24,587
matches perfectly
with the inscription

502
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,621
you wrote to Terry.

503
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:26,689
- Yeah, tell you
the truth,

504
00:17:26,722 --> 00:17:29,692
I didn't actually
write this inscription myself.

505
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:30,693
both: What?

506
00:17:30,726 --> 00:17:31,794
- Come on, you guys, grow up.

507
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,763
You think I have time
to answer each letter I get

508
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:35,631
from every sad little
fat kid that writes me?

509
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:36,966
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants,

510
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,868
precisely for that
sort of crap.

511
00:17:38,901 --> 00:17:39,902
- But you said
you remembered me.

512
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,804
- Because you were the cop
assigned to my case.

513
00:17:41,837 --> 00:17:43,739
Look, I didn't want to
piss you off.

514
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,841
The man you're looking for,
he's my ex-assistant.

515
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,610
His name is Edmund Grail.

516
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:48,611
The guy hates me.

517
00:17:48,644 --> 00:17:49,645
I slept with his wife,

518
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,813
so naturally,
I had to fire him.

519
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:51,981
- Yeah,
that's a cool story.

520
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:53,849
- After that, I got sort of
involved with his sister.

521
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:55,485
It was kind of hot—
- Please stop talking.

522
00:17:55,518 --> 00:17:56,586
- Fine.

523
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,988
I have a little bit of research
to attend to myself,

524
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:00,623
if you understand
what I'm talking about.

525
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:01,824
- Enjoy having sex

526
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:04,394
with three gorgeous women
in cosplay.

527
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:07,597
Well, that went terribly.

528
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,731
I'm so sorry.

529
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:10,032
Do you need a moment alone

530
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,501
or you want to
talk about it or—

531
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:12,968
[pages rip]

532
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:14,003
Yep yep.
That works, too.

533
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:17,873
- Hey, good news.

534
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:19,675
I found the address of
Parlov's old assistant.

535
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:20,943
I'm gonna go over there
and question him.

536
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,945
You want to come?

537
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,146
Maybe he won't open the door

538
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,548
and you'll have to
kick it down.

539
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:26,849
That always cheers you up.

540
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:28,584
- I don't feel like
kicking down doors.

541
00:18:28,618 --> 00:18:30,052
- What about running
really fast through a wall,

542
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,687
leaving a perfect outline
of your body?

543
00:18:31,721 --> 00:18:32,888
- Like a cartoon?

544
00:18:32,922 --> 00:18:34,089
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

545
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:35,658
I'm just gonna sit here
and think about

546
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:38,027
how the words I lived by
my entire life

547
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,429
are a big fat lie.

548
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:41,397
- Look, Sarge,
I understand what it's like

549
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,933
to have a hero who doesn't act
the way you want him to.

550
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:45,935
- It's not gonna be about
Patrick Ewing again, is it?

551
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:47,437
- No, and it's not about
John Starks, either,

552
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,571
who I also pantsed.

553
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,105
- How many Knicks
have you pantsed?

554
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:53,108
- Including coaches, five,
but that's not the point.

555
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:55,578
The hero
I was talking about is you.

556
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:59,148
You're a great cop and dad
and husband and boss.

557
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,451
And also, you always smell
just a little bit like vanilla.

558
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:02,918
- That's my soap.

559
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:03,986
I got it at Lush.

560
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,055
- You're who I want to be
when I grow up, Terry.

561
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:07,690
And you should know
that some dumb inscription

562
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:10,025
in some stupid book
isn't what made you who you are.

563
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:12,027
And it bums me out
that you can't see that.

564
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:14,129
Now, I'm gonna go
get this bad guy,

565
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:16,599
because that's what
you taught me to do.

566
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,570
Also what was the name
of the soap store again?

567
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:21,704
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.

568
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:24,674
- Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.

569
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:26,141
- Well, it was a real hard
decision,

570
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:27,610
but ultimately we decided

571
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:28,944
the Boyles
are going to Aruba!

572
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:30,946
[both gasp quietly]

573
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,715
- All right, Sam, well,
I'm happy to hear that.

574
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:34,584
I think the sun's gonna be
really good

575
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:36,051
for everyone's psoriasis.

576
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:37,987
- We're all so excited.

577
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,055
All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.

578
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:41,557
- Whoops.
Lost you.

579
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:43,626
It was almost too easy.

580
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:46,161
I'm like the Temple Grandin
of herding Boyles.

581
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:47,530
- Yes, you are.

582
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,164
- What?
Why are you smiling?

583
00:19:49,198 --> 00:19:50,666
I don't get it.
I won.

584
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,934
- Did you?

585
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,036
You were so busy trying to beat
the Boyles, you became one.

586
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:56,038
You learned about
our likes and dislikes,

587
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,740
our allergies
and our phobias.

588
00:19:57,773 --> 00:20:00,142
You even bought cousin Sherman
a scrunchy for his ponytail.

589
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:01,644
- Yeah, so I could win.

590
00:20:01,677 --> 00:20:02,645
- And you did win...

591
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:05,080
a plot in
the family cemetery.

592
00:20:05,114 --> 00:20:06,482
All of us together

593
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:08,117
lying in a grave
for eternity!

594
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,519
- "Grave" singular?

595
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:11,521
Charles, "grave" singular?

596
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:13,188
- Oh, Captain,
I know you don't want to

597
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:15,591
talk about Monty Hall,
but I did contact a math—

598
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,493
- No need, Santiago.
It's all good.

599
00:20:17,527 --> 00:20:18,528
- So the fight with Kevin
is over?

600
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:19,361
- Yep.

601
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:20,630
- Because you
understand the math now?

602
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:21,631
- Nope.

603
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:22,632
- Because you guys—
- Yep.

604
00:20:22,665 --> 00:20:24,967
- Knew it.

605
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,769
See, what happened is,
your dads had sex.

606
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:28,037
- Okay, Rosa.

607
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,539
[knock at door]

608
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:32,141
- Edmund Grail?

609
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:33,543
- Who wants to know?

610
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:34,577
- NYPD.

611
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,811
I need to ask you
a few questions

612
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:37,046
about DC Parlov.

613
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,180
- Oh, okay.

614
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:39,615
Let me just
undo the chain.

615
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,620
[faint clattering]

616
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,790
- Son of a bitch.

617
00:20:52,227 --> 00:20:53,696
Freeze!

618
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:54,764
- [grunts]

619
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:59,034
- Taste the might of Ka'Lar!

620
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:00,536
Get him out of here.

621
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:03,739
- Nice work, Sarge.

622
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:04,740
- You were right.

623
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:06,709
Who cares about Parlov?

624
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:08,110
We write our own stories.

625
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,580
So welcome
to the Terry Chronicles.

626
00:21:10,613 --> 00:21:11,647
Book One:

627
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:13,716
The Arrest of Edmund Grail.

628
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:15,217
- Followed by Book Two:

629
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,119
The Ravishing of Sharon.

630
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,253
I am so sorry.

631
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:19,655
I'm just pumped
that you showed up.

632
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:20,823
- I couldn't let you down.

633
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:23,292
- And that is why
you are my hero.

634
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,194
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.

635
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:26,562
Oop—
[grunts]

636
00:21:26,596 --> 00:21:27,697
Oh, no!

637
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,231
It happened again!

638
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:31,601
It happened again, Terry!
