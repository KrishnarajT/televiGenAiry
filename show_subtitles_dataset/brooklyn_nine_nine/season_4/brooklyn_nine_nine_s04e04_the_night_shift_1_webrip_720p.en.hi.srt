177
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:34,895
- I got it.
- Got it.

178
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:35,962
- What do we got?

179
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:39,233
- Back window's broken,
two sets of sneaker prints,

180
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:42,569
alarm went off at 11:43,
and security arrived at 11:46.

181
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:43,670
Perps were already gone.

182
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:46,573
- Okay, I'm thinking classic us.

183
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,708
I'm thinking old times.

184
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:48,575
I'm thinking...

185
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:51,412
[together]
Rigity-rigity-role playas!

186
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:53,380
- Yes, okay,
I'm Jacques Guillaume,

187
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:54,581
and you are Henri Renault.

188
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,650
We are cat burglars
on vacation from France.

189
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:59,553
- I love it—although Henri
went to an elite international

190
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:01,255
school, so he does not
speak with an accent.

191
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:03,257
- Wow, nice, way to
flesh out the characters.

192
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,292
- Thank you, okay,
so I break the back window,

193
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:06,460
make my way over
to the jewelry case.

194
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,662
Meanwhile, you're standing
lookout by the front door...

195
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:11,232
- Oui, oui.

196
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:12,633
- Smoking a cigarette.

197
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,767
Check it: ash.

198
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,202
- [French accent]
Ooh la la.

199
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:17,971
Okay, so I am smoking.

200
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:18,905
- What are you doing?

201
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,442
- Oh, Jacques rolls
his own cigarettes,

202
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,610
a habit he picked up from
a prostitute in Marseille,

203
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,746
but that is not all
he picked up.

204
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,248
- Why do all your
characters get STDs?

205
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:28,549
- [normal voice]
Because they're living life!

206
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:31,285
- All right, so I go
to the first case—smash—

207
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:32,286
steal a bunch of watches.

208
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,721
Move over to the second
case—smash—bracelets.

209
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:36,390
But then, we hear
a sound, and...

210
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:38,692
- I yell, "Les gendarmes!
Ils sont ici!"

211
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:39,893
- And I know what that means
because I'm French,

212
00:06:39,926 --> 00:06:41,628
but I ask you to repeat it in
English, just to be sure.

213
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:42,729
- Police are here.

214
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:44,698
- Yes, we gotta get outta here,
so we turn to leave,

215
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:46,567
you flick your cigarette.

216
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,769
Using the cane, using
the cane, this is awesome.

217
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:51,638
[gasps]
Voila! Zee butt.

218
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,274
- I thought Henri didn't
have an accent.

219
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:54,675
- It comes out
when he gets excited.

220
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,277
Great news, everyone.

221
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,512
We just got our first lead
on our first case

222
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:01,014
on my first night back,
proving once and for all

223
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,517
that absolutely
nothing has changed.

224
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,751
[grunts]

225
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:06,787
- Yeah, this opens in
instead of out now.

226
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,854
They switched it a month ago.

227
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:10,557
- Yeah, so the door changed,
sure, but that's it.

228
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:14,661
- Well, we have got
ourselves a case and

229
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:15,729
a key piece of evidence.

230
00:07:15,762 --> 00:07:17,698
We should be wrapping
this thing up in no time.

231
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,566
- As long as we do it
before sunup.

232
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,735
As soon as the shift is over,
I kind of have to get home.

233
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:22,736
- But we're gonna work until
it's done, right?

234
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:23,904
I mean, that's how we do it.

235
00:07:23,937 --> 00:07:26,473
- Yeah, I just like to be home
as soon as Nikolaj wakes up

236
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:27,641
so I can make him breakfast.

237
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:30,644
- Sure, yeah, not a problem—
we'll be home by sunup.

238
00:07:30,677 --> 00:07:33,680
Just like a couple of sexy
"Twilight" vampires.

239
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:34,715
[as Dracula]
I am Robert Pattinson.

240
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:36,550
I vant to turn into a bat.

241
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,584
[normal voice]
I've never seen the movies.

242
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:39,386
- No, me neither—they're
an insult to the books.

243
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,387
- Okay.

244
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:41,755
Crank up the tunes, Boyle.

245
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:43,590
The Night Boys
need an anthem.

246
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:45,592
Something dark,
something tough, something—

247
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:46,727
- I already got it.

248
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,763
[Lionel Richie's
"All Night Long" playing]

249
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:50,731
- You know what?

250
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,065
I'm into it.

251
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,601
The night shift
won't slow us down.

252
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:56,537
- Why is this going so slow?
Where is everyone?

253
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,704
- Well, it is 3:00 a.m.

254
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,340
It's a pretty bare-bones crew.

255
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:00,374
- Hi, can I help you?

256
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:01,207
Are you lost?

257
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,076
Can I get you
something—coffee, tea?

258
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,077
- You know what—
we're in a bit of a hurry.

259
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,379
Can you run this DNA for us?

260
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:06,313
- Well, of course.

261
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:08,715
Sorry, not many people
stopping by at night.

262
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:11,418
Sometimes it makes you like—
[blows raspberry]

263
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:12,653
[squelching]
Right?

264
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:13,654
both: Uh-huh.

265
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:14,655
- I'll be back in a sec.

266
00:08:14,688 --> 00:08:15,589
- Cool.

267
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:19,092
Yikes... not exactly
the A-team at this hour.

268
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,694
- "A-Team," are you guys
talking "A-Team"?

269
00:08:20,727 --> 00:08:22,529
I love that show—
I could download it.

270
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:23,530
We should binge it.

271
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:24,798
This is gonna be fun.

272
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,868
- Yep, totally excited to watch
five full seasons of television

273
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:30,904
with you, but could you actually
run the DNA for us first?

274
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:32,806
- It kind of feels like you're
prioritizing work

275
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:33,807
over our friendship.

276
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,108
- Because I barely know you?

277
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:37,811
- Fine, message received.

278
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:40,647
[upbeat music]

279
00:08:40,681 --> 00:08:42,583
- Oh, welcome back
from your third

280
00:08:42,616 --> 00:08:43,750
massive break of the night.

281
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:46,086
- Thanks.
- I was being sarcastic.

282
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,821
Where do you keep going?
- Not saying.

283
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:48,789
- Tell me, Diaz.
- Nope.

284
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:49,956
- Come on, tell me.
- Not talking about it.

285
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,758
- Tell me, tell me, tell me,
tell me, tell me, tell me—

286
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,427
- Fine.

287
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,862
I was in the bathroom.
I'm having stomach problems.

288
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:56,863
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

289
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:58,565
- Sorry.
- It's real bad—

290
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,700
- No, that's all right.
- You should've been there.

291
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:00,734
- I don't have to hear it.
- It was like a massacre.

292
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:01,568
- No, you can—please stop.
- Multiple flush.

293
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,804
- Please stop.
- Attention, squad.

294
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,506
Everyone, gather 'round.

295
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,841
I've been researching ways
to raise morale, and I found

296
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:09,843
an interesting article
in a scientific journal.

297
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:13,847
- Oh, was it from "The American
Journal of No One Cares"?

298
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,718
- According to a recent study,
the physical act of smiling

299
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:18,785
can improve your mood.

300
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,353
I suggest we give it a shot.

301
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,123
Eh?

302
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:24,491
Now you all try.

303
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,130
Big smiles, bigger, bigger!

304
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:31,798
Great, now we just
have to stay like this

305
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:32,866
for the next two hours.

306
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,468
Can you feel it working?

307
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:35,736
- I don't have any enamel
on my teeth,

308
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:37,438
so the cold air is excruciating.

309
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:39,573
- Maybe if you brushed your
teeth once in a while,

310
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:40,741
this wouldn't be a problem.

311
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:42,409
- I do brush my teeth.

312
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,545
They're decaying
from acid reflux.

313
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:45,746
You're embarrassing yourself.

314
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:46,747
[Australian accent]
- Crikey.

315
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,848
- You're not Australian, Gina.

316
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,783
- Get stuffed, ya drongo.

317
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:51,985
- Guys, seriously,
too much exposure to air,

318
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:53,687
and they will turn to dust.

319
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,490
- This isn't working out as well
as I'd hoped.

320
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:57,891
Time for the next level:

321
00:09:57,924 --> 00:10:00,827
forced laughing.

322
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,897
[laughs]

323
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,801
- Well, that lab tech
took a long time.

324
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,169
- Once we agreed to go to
his birthday party,

325
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:10,136
he was actually pretty fast.

326
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,773
But, most importantly,
we got a DNA match.

327
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:16,843
We're looking for...
Dave Smith.

328
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,178
Sounds like a real
piece of crap.

329
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,145
- You said it.

330
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:20,947
Now we just gotta
pull his files from records.

331
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:23,517
- Yep, then we bust him,
and we'll be done with plenty

332
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,785
of time before Nikolaj wakes up.

333
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,186
- [correcting]
Nikolaj.

334
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,821
- Hm?
Nikolaj, yeah, I said it.

335
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:29,490
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

336
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:30,791
- Not even close.
Nikolaj.

337
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,559
- Nikolaj.
- Almost—Nikolaj.

338
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:33,727
- Nikolaj—I feel
like I'm saying it.

339
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,861
You know what—
it doesn't matter.

340
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,563

- Can't—system's down.

They do maintenance at night.

attempted tickling.

- Right, tickling.

Look, uh, Charles, this guy's
a real... doodyhead, all right?

He tickled once—
he may tickle again.

He might be tickling
as we speak.

just crazy enough to work?

I love that you have a son—
it's not messing everything up.

you've had a challenging night,

00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:13,747

and small talk about how

445
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,116
some of us are big lying liars
who lie all the time

446
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:18,084
like a bunch of liars, Rosa.

447
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:20,887
- I don't think that's good
party convo.

448
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:25,859
Uh, maybe we should just name
our favorite sailing knot.

449
00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:27,894
I'll start.

[upbeat Sousa march]

Why is no one

I specifically requested it.

Gina, why aren't you dancing?

460
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:51,351
- I can't. I'm in the middle
of a feud with

the "that's not a knife" guy

He's being a real bitch.

463
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:58,925
- Fine, I guess I'll just...
stop the party.

464
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,860

it ever started.

465
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,161
- Enough.

466
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:02,863
I tried to make this fun.

467
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:05,431
I even learned
what Skrillex was.

Sorry you're all miserable,
but guess what.

469
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,468
So am I.

470
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:10,804
I'm exhausted all the time,

Just go home.

474
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:24,450
- Hey, I saw you earlier.

475
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:25,952
You weren't in the bathroom.

476
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:28,822
You were on a park bench
playing on your phone.

477
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:31,357
Yeah, you left me to do
everything while I thought

478
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:32,959
you were pooping.

479
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:36,096
I wish you were pooping.
I wish to God.

480
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,131
- I'm sorry.

don't know what to do.

This feels wrong.

three weeks ago.

485
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:49,776
Pimento should've been
back by now.

486
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,778
We had plans to meet on
that park bench once

487
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:53,980
the coast was clear,
but he hasn't shown up.

488
00:15:54,014 --> 00:15:57,017
- Maybe he's deep undercover, or
he doesn't remember who he is,

489
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,018
or maybe he's dead.

490
00:15:58,051 --> 00:15:59,986
- Wow, thanks.

491
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,221
You're right,
my fiancé's a total weirdo

492
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:02,789
who's probably dead.

493
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:05,091
I'll just give up on him
and go do my paperwork.

494
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,995
- No, Diaz, wait—maybe he's
just really, really injured.

495
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,230
Come on, Amy.

496
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:14,534
- All right,
Fiske, Jones, Thompkins...

00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,938
[gasps]
Smith.

498
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:19,139
Smith.

499
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,842
Whoa, hey, NYPD, freeze!

500
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:22,876
Slow down!
This isn't fair!

501
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:24,945
I have a cane.

502
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:25,946
[panting]

503
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:28,882
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

504
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:31,017
NYPD.

505
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:33,119
NYPD—I need to
commandeer this vehicle.

506
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:35,155
- It's a crossover.

507
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:37,223
It's a crossover SUV,
and you can't have it.

508
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:38,959
- I'm a cop—can you please
get out of the car?

509
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:42,028
- No, this Schmidt's mom's car,
and I'm more scared of her

510
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:43,897
than I am of some two-bit thug.

511
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,465
- I'm not a thug—I'm police.

512
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:47,000
- Okay, then name one law.

513
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,101
- Don't kill people.

514
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,070
- That's on me—
I set the bar too low.

515
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:51,271
- Look, can you please
just get out?

516
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,907
- Okay, you can drive,
but I'm not getting out.

517
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,841
- Right.
- Also, I have the seat warmer

518
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,877
on—I don't just have
a really hot butt.

519
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,179
- Doesn't matter to me—
a perp is getting away.

520
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:00,981
Oh, it's very hot.

521
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:02,048
[car screeches]

522
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:04,150
- I can't believe
this is happening.

523
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:05,886
Thanks a lot, New York.

524
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,921
You know what, if your city's
so great, then how come

525
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,189
it's not the state capital?

526
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,224
- What—who cares about
the state's capital?

527
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:13,593
This is the concrete jungle
where dreams are made of.

528
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,061
That doesn't sound right—
where dreams are made of?

529
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:16,562
- I don't know—
you tell me.

530
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,631
It's your dumb city.
- It's grammatically odd.

531
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:20,300
Whatever, I'm sure wherever
you're from has strange songs

532
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,302
written about it, too.
- Los Angeles?

533
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,170
- Damn it, all the songs
there are so good.

534
00:17:24,204 --> 00:17:25,972
[yells]

535
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:26,940
[grunts]

536
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:29,209
- Hey, watch my soup.

537
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:31,878
- I'm chasing a criminal.
Your soup is not important.

538
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:34,047
- You took an oath
to serve and protect.

539
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,081
That applies to my soup.

540
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,983
- You know that's not
what the oath is about.

541
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,284
You're making a point
you don't even believe in.

542
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:40,520
- Garbage truck!
[both screaming]

543
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:43,990
[tires screeching
and glass breaking]

544
00:17:44,024 --> 00:17:44,991
- Oh.
- Damn it!

545
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:45,992
He got away.

546
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:47,093
- Well, I spilled my soup.

547
00:17:47,127 --> 00:17:48,528
You tell me which is worse.

548
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,997
- My thing.
Very clearly my thing.

549
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:55,435
- Captain Holt,
can we talk to you?

550
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:56,569
- What is the meaning of this?

551
00:17:56,602 --> 00:17:58,538
Am I the subject of a punking?

552
00:17:58,571 --> 00:18:01,908
- It's a beginning-of-work
hang.

553
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:03,576
- And why are you all
in such good moods?

554
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:05,678
- Because you told us that
you're miserable, too.

555
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,080
And that means
you'll fight to get us off

556
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:09,115
the night shift, right?

557
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:11,584
- Well, here's what I have to
say about that: the night shift

558
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:14,988
stinks—stinks like a butt.
And I will do everything

559
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:17,958
in my power to make sure
we get back to the day shift.

560
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,225
What are we standing around for?

561
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:23,063
Put some Sousa on already.
I want to get wild.

562
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:25,631
- Well, well, well,
if it isn't one of

563
00:18:25,665 --> 00:18:26,732
the world-famous Night Bros.

564
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:30,036
- It's the Night Boys, and—
why did I correct you?

565
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,237
I would've preferred "Bros."

566
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,605
- Did you solve
your case yet?

567
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:34,274
- No.
- Night shift, am I right?

568
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:35,608
You remind me of me.

569
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:36,876
- It's not
the night shift, okay?

570
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,980
I found the perp, and I would've
taken him down, but I'm hobbled,

571
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:41,714
and I didn't have a partner
because ever since Boyle

572
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:42,882
had a son, that's all
he can focus on.

573
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,619
- Whoa, hey, are you angry at
Boyle for having a kid?

574
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:49,289
- No, I'm just mad because
I'm working the night shift,

575
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:51,291
and I have to use a cane,
and, yes, the one thing I could

576
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,126
always count on no matter what—
Boyle being there for me—

577
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:54,127
is also gone.

578
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,296
- What do you say we let
day shift Lohank take

579
00:18:56,329 --> 00:18:58,198
a crack at this?
- [sighs]

580
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:00,733
- I'm gonna put a little
something up in the old hopper.

581
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,035
You tell me if it vibes
with you.

582
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:03,103
- That's so gross.

583
00:19:03,136 --> 00:19:05,972
- Life moves forwards,
not backwards, and things

584
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:07,974
will never be as they were.

585
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:11,511
And you can be angry about that,
or you can embrace the fact

586
00:19:11,544 --> 00:19:13,980
that your best friend
now has a son.

587
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:15,115
How cool is that, amigo?

588
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:17,317
- Ugh, "amigo."

589
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,987
All right, fine, yes, I'll admit
it, it is pretty cool.

590
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:23,123
Boyle's wanted it
for a very long time.

591
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:24,757
I guess I haven't actually spent
that much time with Nikolaj yet.

592
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,891
[correcting]
- Nikolaj.

593
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,727
- Man, am I seriously
about to take emotional advice

594
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,995
from Lohank?

595
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:31,064
- You know you want to,
compadre.

596
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,601
Go to him.

597
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:38,204
- Hey, I'm really sorry.

598
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,240
I shouldn't have said that
about Pimento.

599
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:41,774
I'm sure he's gonna come back.

600
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,609
- I'm not even
thinking about it anymore.

601
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:44,877
That wasn't even me crying
in the bathroom earlier—

602
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,147
that was someone else with these
same boots, but now she's gone.

603
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,683
- Look, when Jake was in witness
protection, and I didn't know

604
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:52,385
when he was ever coming back,
you were always there

605
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:54,054
when I needed to vent.

606
00:19:54,087 --> 00:19:57,057
So I'll do your paperwork,
and if you ever want company

607
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,724
on that bench, I'm there.

608
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:01,227
- Thanks... I would advise
against it though—if he does

609
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:04,297
come back, things are gonna get
real raunchy, real fast, like,

610
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,366
do a lot of licking, that's
probably indecent exposure—

611
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:07,600
I don't want to get—
- Okay, got it.

612
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:10,070
You know what—I'll just start
with this stack right here.

613
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,072
Thanks, Rosa, okay, good talk.

614
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:13,339
[knocking]

615
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,109
- Hey, what's up?

616
00:20:16,142 --> 00:20:17,310
I can't work the case
tonight.

617
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:18,811
Nikolaj's allergies
are acting up,

618
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,146
and now the dog seems to be
allergic to him.

619
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,681
It's this whole thing.

620
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:22,482
Did you find Smith?

621
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,717
- No, uh,
he actually got away.

622
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,719
- Sorry, man.
- Ah, it's all right.

623
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:28,621
It's the day shift's
problem now.

624
00:20:28,654 --> 00:20:30,356
- Whatever happened to
working until it's done?

625
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,195
- Honestly... Lohank kind of
talked some sense into me.

626
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:38,798
- Lohank?
- Yeah, it was so gross,

627
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:41,601
but I want to apologize.
- For what?

628
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:43,203
- Well, I kept talking about
how I wanted everything

629
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:46,439
to go back to normal,
but if that actually happened,

630
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:47,740
this little guy
wouldn't be here.

631
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:48,741
Or is he big?

632
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:50,210
I don't know what size
kids are supposed to be,

633
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:51,844
or anything about kids, really.

634
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,380
I think maybe that's part of
the problem—it doesn't matter.

635
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:55,815
I got a present for Nikolaj.

636
00:20:56,782 --> 00:20:59,285
- Thanks, Jake.
Come on in, give it to him.

637
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,187
- Niko.
- Hey, little man.

638
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:03,123
- [gasps]
A garbage truck!

639
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:04,757
- You wanna know something cool?

640
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,760
A truck just like this
almost killed me today.

641
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:08,561
- [clears throat]

642
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:10,830
- Uh, kissed me,
almost kissed me.

643
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:13,333
Anyway, let's get some trash in
this thing—am I right?

644
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,667
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom!

645
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,470
- You're silly.
- Yep, I am silly.

646
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:19,472
- Oh, my God,
this is a dream come true.

647
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:21,141
I gotta get my phone—
I gotta film this.

648
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:22,142
Oh, but then I'll miss it.

649
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:23,309
Oh, but I want it forever.

650
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:24,744
Agh, but I should
stay in the moment.

651
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:25,545
Ah, but then I'll forget.

652
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:27,180
Oh, my God,
this is a nightmare.

653
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,750
- Not a doctor, shh.
