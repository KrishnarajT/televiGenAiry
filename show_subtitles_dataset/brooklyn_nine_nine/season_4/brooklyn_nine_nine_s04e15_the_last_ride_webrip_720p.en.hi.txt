1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:02,303
- Attention, squad.

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,271
Here's where we stand
vis-à-vis whether or not

3
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:07,741
the precinct will be
shut down.

4
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,310
The precinct will be shut down.

5
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,511
- What?
- No!

6
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,246
- But I thought the official
hearing wasn't until tonight.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,614
Amy's friend at HQ
heard that maybe

8
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,282
the Seven-Four was getting
shut down instead.

9
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,551
- There's no way that's true.
Amy doesn't have a friend.

10
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,685
- I do so!

11
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,487
Although, I only see her
at work events,

12
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,389
and we only talk through email.

13
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:23,657
Oh, God, she's just a colleague.

14
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,260
- Santiago's work acquaintance
is correct.

15
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:27,661
Tonight at 7:00
the committee is choosing

16
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,363
between us and the Seven-Four,

17
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,665
although the Seven-Four
has a significant advantage.

18
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,401
They house
an elite gang task force.

19
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,502
- Well, this is on you, sir.

20
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,271
I begged you for a task force,

21
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,240
but no, you wouldn't give me
funding for

22
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,742
Strike-Team Thunder-Kill Alpha,
colon, Hard Target.

23
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,244
- You never told me
what it was for.

24
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:45,246
- It's a strike team that...

25
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:48,482
kills thunder and puts its
colon on hard targets.

26
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,350
- They're gonna split us up

27
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,351
and send us all
to different precincts.

28
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,586
This is the last time
I'm gonna stand up here

29
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,787
and look at you guys.

30
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,490
Hitchcock,
close your damn legs!

31
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,325
- No!
This isn't over yet.

32
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,426
Sure, maybe we don't have

33
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,396
Strike-Team Thunder-Kill Alpha,
colon, Hard Target,

34
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,497
but we're the Nine-Nine.

35
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,532
We have Rosa and Charles,

36
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,669
Gina, Amy and Terry,
and Carl!

37
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:09,470
- It's Mark.
- Sorry.

38
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,671
I was just trying
to include someone

39
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,672
from outside
the inner circle.

40
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,006
- There's an inner circle?

41
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,008
- The point is
we're not rolling over.

42
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,578
We're gonna solve a huge case
before the hearing tonight,

43
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,980
and then the NYPD cannot
shut us down.

44
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,816
So come on, Captain,
give me something big and juicy.

45
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:23,650
What do you got?

46
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,586
- A ten-year-old
had his bike stolen.

47
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,321
- We are S'd in the B.

48
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:30,324
[upbeat music]

49
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:37,398
♪

50
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,477
- Hi-do-ho there,
Charlie old boy.

51
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,745
Come have a seat.

52
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,814
- Beanbags?
But these are happy seats.

53
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,616
Why are you happy?

54
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,018
Oh, my God, you figured out
how to save the precinct.

55
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,653
[gasps]
You got a juicy case.

56
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,754
You juiced this mama.

57
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,456
- Nope, same unjuicy case.

58
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,325
New juicer attitude.

59
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,493
The way I see it,
if this is to be our last ride

60
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,629
then let us go out
in a blaze of glory.

61
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,596
- Ooh.
- Charles, think about

62
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,298
anything you ever
wanted to do on a case.

63
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,299
We're doing it today.

64
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,400
- Oh, hence the beanbags.

65
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,035
- Hence is right,
and also hence

66
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,803
we're gonna drive around
in the coolest undercover car

67
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,505
in the impound lot.

68
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,073
- Herbie from
"Herbie Fully Loaded."

69
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,375
- What? No.

70
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:23,377
You really think "Herbie Fully
Loaded" was on the impound lot?

71
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,045
- Without a doubt.
- Well, anyway, it's a Mustang.

72
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,347
It's got a stripe
down the middle.

73
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,448
- Like Herbie.
- Okay.

74
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,351
- One question, can we wear
matching leather jackets?

75
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,752
- Oh, man, I don't know
if we're gonna have time

76
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,420
to pull something
like that together!

77
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,488
What?

78
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,622
- Blaze of glory!

79
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,758
- Blaze of glory.

80
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,793
- You're not giving us
any new cases?

81
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,629
There's nothing to work on.

82
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,798
Damn it!
So this is how it ends.

83
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,901
- Well, every ending is
a new beginning.

84
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,404
[chuckles] Another great
Gina Linetti entrance.

85
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,773
You better savor these
while you still can, sarge.

86
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,107
- Gina, I am not in the mood.

87
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,876
How are you so unaffected
by all this?

88
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,811
- Because I have
already moved on.

89
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,714
I'm devoting my energy
to my new project, Ginazon.

90
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,385
It's a one-stop online portal
for my legions of followers.

91
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:07,554
Speaking of whom,
what's up G-Hive?

92
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,855
It's Queen Gee.

93
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:09,723
I'm bored at work,

94
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,893
so I'm gonna prank
all my coworkers.

95
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,929
- That sounds like a bad idea
for an already crappy day.

96
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,798
- Fine, sarge.
I won't do it.

97
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,567
I will do it,
so you can count this

98
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,869
as my first prank I guess,
unofficially.

99
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,906
- Hey, Diaz, HQ isn't giving us
any new cases

100
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,441
because we might shut down.

101
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,575
You have anything?

102
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,377
- No, sorry, I got nothing.
- Oh, man!

103
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,647
I am one arrest away from
the all-time precinct record.

104
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,482
Two more solves woulda
put me over the top.

105
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,817
- So? Nothing wrong
with second place.

106
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,485
- Name one silver medalist.

107
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,487
- Michelle Kwan.
- She fell, Rosa.

108
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,688
She fell so much!

109
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,689
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,625
- Besides, it's not about
me wanting the record.

111
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,527
It's about who currently has it.

112
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,528
Hitchcock.

113
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,729
both: Hitchcock?

114
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:49,630
- How is that possible?

115
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,732
- He's been here 20 years
longer than me,

116
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:54,601
and New York City in the '80s
was basically "The Purge."

117
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,737
- I always knew I was
the best cop in the Nine-Nine,

118
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,606
and now there's proof.

119
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,543
Oh, man!
My pasghetti!

120
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,578
- We're getting you that record.

121
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,513
- Hey, can I talk
to the captain?

122
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,581
- Ugh, he's on the phone.

123
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:08,915
Do you want a coffee
while you wait?

124
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,751
They made me an extra one
on accident.

125
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,653
- Oh, sure.

126
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,855
Thank you.

127
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,658
Oh, my God!
What is that?

128
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,494
- Cement!
You just drank cement!

129
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,629
Guys, check back in
to see if she dies.

130
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,197
Ugh!
[choking]

131
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,633
You're not really gonna die
probably, okay?

132
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,635
Just a little honey
for the G-Hive.

133
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,472
Also you can talk to Holt.
He is not on the phone.

134
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:32,739
- What is happening?

135
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,409
- It's a little something I call
two pranks for the price of one!

136
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,579
- [gasps]

137
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,913
- Santiago, I'm on the phone.

138
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,648
Gina: Triple prank!

139
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,684
- I'm so sorry, sir.
I can come back later.

140
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:45,452
- No, it's too late.
The call is ruined.

141
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,654
Good-bye, dear.
What do you want?

142
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,523
- Well, since there's
a good chance

143
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,757
that things are coming
to an end,

144
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,659
I just wanted to say thank you

145
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,227
for everything
that you've taught me.

146
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,863
I know you may not see yourself
as my mentor, but—

147
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,965
- Of course I do. I've been
mentoring you all this time.

148
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,635
- What?

149
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,572
- This is day 1,282
of a nine-year mentorship

150
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,773
I had mapped out for you.

151
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,476
Under ordinary circumstances
I wouldn't reveal this to you

152
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,811
until day 3,300.

153
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,212
- It was real.

154
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,814
There was a binder.

155
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,482
- Not anymore.

156
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,517
- No!

157
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,784
You can still mentor me
if we don't work together.

158
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,052
We could meet for breakfast
every day.

159
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,521
You could teach me over eggs.

160
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,655
- Eggs for breakfast?

161
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,689
You're further behind
than I thought.

162
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,491
- Ah!
No, look, okay.

163
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,693
There are ten hours left, sir.

164
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:30,230
If you talk fast enough,
you can teach me everything.

165
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,533
- Interesting.
Okay.

166
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,700
You'll have to take notes.

167
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,868
Do you think you can keep up?

168
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,237
- Let's just say I was president
of the Stenographer's Club

169
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,905
in high school for a reason.

170
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,942
- Was the reason because
you were the only member?

171
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,544
- Yes.

172
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,278
- This is so cool!

173
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,713
I feel like we're
in a cologne ad.

174
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,615
- Oh, yeah, check this out.

175
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:49,850
Whoop!
- Yeah!

176
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,586
Cleaning your teeth in public
like you just don't give a what.

177
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,821
- No, it's like a cool toothpick
like Stallone in "Cobra."

178
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,756
- Eh, lateral move.

179
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,858
Hey, I know this is just
a stolen bike case,

180
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,992
but you know what
we should do?

181
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,294
Stand back-to-back
with our guns drawn

182
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,929
while we're surrounded
by bad guys.

183
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,064
- You know what I call that.

184
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,632
The man sprinkler.
- Bullet tornado.

185
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,432
- Yep, bullet tornado.

186
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,634
- What was yours?
I didn't hear it.

187
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,902
- Same as you.
Bullet tornado.

188
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,737
The important thing is we don't
have to talk about it anymore

189
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,005
'cause we both said
the same excellent name.

190
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,006
- Ah.
- Wait a minute, Boyle.

191
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,007
Is this our bike?

192
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,542
- Green grips, orange pegs.

193
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,943
I think it is.

194
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,011
[rock music]

195
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,980
[tires squeal]

196
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,882
NYPD!
Hands on your head!

197
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,750
- Hood slide.

198
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,752
Congratulations, punk.

199
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:28,789
Charles, tell him what he won.

200
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,624
You're supposed to tell him
he's won an all-expenses-paid,

201
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,992
luxury trip to hell.
We rehearsed this.

202
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,094
- I'm sorry, I know.
It just hit me that it's over.

203
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,762
I wanted the case
to last longer.

204
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,764
- Come on,
it's not necessarily over.

205
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,800
I mean, this guy could still
make a break for it

206
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,968
or take me hostage or...

207
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,904
have a huge bag of heroin.

208
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,572
- Oh, my God,
it's not over yet.

209
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,007
This just became
a giant drug case.

210
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,909
- We can save the Nine-Nine.
- We can save the Nine-Nine!

211
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,877
- This man is our savior.
- And he looks like Jesus.

212
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,145
- Yeah, he looks like
a hunky Jesus.

213
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:52,979
- Yeah!

214
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,848
- Thanks for the heroin,
Hunky Jesus.

215
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,285
- How'd the interrogation go?
- Awesome.

216
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,321
I got to do something
that I always wanted to do.

217
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,223
You make me sick.

218
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,292
Hee-ya!

219
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,261
He was actually really helpful.
I feel bad.

220
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,363
Anyways, turns out he works
for a dealer named Dom,

221
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,332
who supplies half
the heroin in the city.

222
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,700
If we take him down,

223
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,168
there's no way they close
the Nine-Nine.

224
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,637
- But the hearing's
in six hours.

225
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,104
How do we get the Dom?

226
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:20,206
- Apparently he uses
BMX riders to move his product,

227
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,042
and as it turns out
when I was a kid

228
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,944
I was a vert fiend.

229
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,345
- That's great news.
Please explain that.

230
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,246
- That means I rode BMX.
- Ah.

231
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,314
- So we get our perp
to text this Dom guy,

232
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,083
tell him to hire me
to move his product.

233
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,052
Then I show up,
grind a bunch of gnarly rails.

234
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,687
I'm talking real fluffy ones.

235
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,188
- Radical. I bet you're
an awesome fluffer.

236
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,256
- No.
- I bet you fluffed

237
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,991
those other riders right out
of their biker shorts.

238
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:38,992
- Charles—
- I can picture you

239
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,061
as a teenager fluffing
all of New York City.

240
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,062
- Charles, stop talking.

241
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,363
Fluffing has
a different meaning.

242
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,165
So I get the job,
we take down Dom,

243
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,367
precinct's saved,
then I do an ice pick 360

244
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,335
on the podium
at the press conference.

245
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,337
- Awesome.
One question.

246
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,639
Do you still
know how to ride?

247
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,107
- Come on, riding a bike,

248
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,676
it's like riding a bike.

249
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,710
Wheelie.
No.

250
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,044
Wheelie.
No.

251
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,079
Boyle, it's 'cause
you're watching.

252
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,080
- Okay.

253
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,081
- [grunts]
One more try.

254
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,082
[grunts]
One more try.

255
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,083
[grunts]
One more try.

256
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,084
[grunts]
One more try.

257
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,085
[grunts]
One more try.

258
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,086
- Did you do it?

259
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,387
- Hey, sarge, check it out.

260
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,689
Hitchcock got a tattoo.

261
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,691
- Mr. Nine-Nine.

262
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,359
- Why are you putting
a gun in your mouth?

263
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,095
- I'm blowing smoke
off the barrel.

264
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,029
It's cool.

265
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,231
- The barrel is fully
inside your mouth.

266
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,066
You're clearly about
to kill yourself.

267
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,002
- You're just jealous 'cause
he's got the arrest record

268
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,103
and you don't.

269
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,971
- Yeah, suck on this.
Click, pow!

270
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,072
[blows]

271
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,408
- You pulled the trigger, man!
That was a suicide!

272
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,343
- Sarge, I got a case for you.

273
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,345
Guy had his phone stolen
at a bar last night.

274
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,379
- All right!

275
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,447
- It's not that big a deal.

276
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,782
I just need to file
a police report

277
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,050
for my insurance company.

278
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,120
- No, it is a major injustice,
and we're gonna set it right.

279
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,322
- It was a crappy old phone.
I'd rather just get a new one.

280
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,390
- We're the police
and we're here to help you.

281
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,992
So shut your damn mouth.

282
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,093
Now tell us what
he looked like.

283
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,094
- I only saw his back.

284
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,229
Uh, he had a blue hoodie on.

285
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,264
- Whoo!
We got a lead!

286
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,100
[laughs]

287
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:57,003
♪ Ah, you just drank cement

288
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,739
♪ You just drank cement

289
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,340
- Dom just texted.

290
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,175
The meet-up spot
is ten minutes away.

291
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,309
- This is so awesome.

292
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,278
When I was a kid, I said I
wanted to be a BMX detective,

293
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,212
and they laughed at me.

294
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,314
Well, who's laughing now,
Kenny Yarborough?

295
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,083
Kenny actually opened up
a chain of salad places.

296
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,117
He's doing quite well
for himself.

297
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,052
- Oh.
- Yeah.

298
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:15,388
- Hey, what if they can tell
you're amazing

299
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,457
but a little rusty
and therefore kinda bad?

300
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,160
- Not to worry,
BMX is 99% attitude.

301
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,262
So here's the plan,
my name is Tyler Omaha,

302
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,864
born and raised in So-Cal.

303
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,697
Point me to a quarter pipe

304
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,100
and I'm gonna tail-whip
for days, bro.

305
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,369
- And I'm your roller-skating
sidekick, Chip Rockets.

306
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,437
- Welcome aboard, Chip Rockets.
- Thank you.

307
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,405
- And you're married
to the roller skates?

308
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,274
- A hundred percent.
- Roller skates it is.

309
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,176
- Right.

310
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,410
- Just 'cause you're only
gonna be in the car.

311
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:38,812
- A hundred percent, Jake.
- Chip Rockets!

312
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,513
- Chip Rockets.

313
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,883
- Sorry, dude, we don't need
any new riders.

314
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,484
- You know, I used to be pro,

315
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,286
but they said my antics
were too gnar.

316
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,888
Kicked me off the circuit.
- For what?

317
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,789
- You know,
peeing on the track,

318
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,791
having sex during races,
being hella gnar.

319
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,358
You get it, we all have
gyros on our bikes.

320
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,195
The point is I can cut
your delivery times in half.

321
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,130
- Seriously, in half?
I think you're full of it.

322
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,331
I don't think
you could even beat Bodie,

323
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,332
and he's my worst guy.

324
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,233
- Your worst guy?

325
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,202
Come on, I could take
any of these posers.

326
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,105
- Fine, then race Derek.

327
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,272
- Nah, I don't wanna
trouble Derek.

328
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,273
Let's just stick with Bodie.

329
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,274
First thought, best thought,
right?

330
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,409
Let's do this.

331
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,911
- It should take 70 seconds

332
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,512
for you to fully gauge
someone's character.

333
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,847
Here's what to look for.

334
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,916
Grammar, posture,
scent, attire,

335
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,218
level of perspiration,
type of shirt collar.

336
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,219
- What's the best type
of shirt collar?

337
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,120
- English Spread, obviously,

338
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,122
but let's hold the questions
until the end.

339
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,824
When people say, "Good morning,"
they mean, "Hello."

340
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,326
When people say, "How are you?"
they mean, "Hello."

341
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,828
When people say, "What's up?"

342
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,330
they mean, "I am a person
not worth talking to."

343
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,465
There are two acceptable
sleep positions.

344
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,334
On back, toes up, arms crossed,

345
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,837
or on back, toes up,
arms at the side.

346
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,304
Do not trust

00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,520
- Whoa, Dom's one of the biggest
dealers in New York.

521
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,522
Whoever their supplier is
is gonna be huge.

522
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,558
We gotta wait.
- But that's two hours from now.

523
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,427
We'll miss the hearing.
Let's just arrest Dom.

524
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,329
- We'd be getting
a major player off the streets.

525
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,331
I mean, isn't that the job?

526
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,467
- So what are you saying?

527
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,304
- I'm saying the Nine-Nine's
gonna get shut down.

528
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,438
- Damn it!

529
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,440
- I know, it sucks,
but it's the right thing to do.

530
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,409
- No, not that, they're making
fun of Chip Rockets now.

531
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,443
- These drug dealers
are so mean.

532
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,511
- Right!

533
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,450
but it's a big bust,

534
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,819
and at least we're going out
in a blaze of glory.

535
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,622
- Yeah. It feels more like
a blaze of crap.

536
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,792
- Ah, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna get a new partner.

537
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,627
His name's gonna be
Heath or Ryan.

538
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,729
He's gonna know everything
about "Die Hard,"

539
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,364
and he's gonna be super cool.

540
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,632
Jean jacket cool.

541
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,901
- Yeah, yeah,
you could be right.

542
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,803
And hey, you'll get
a cool, new partner too, right?

543
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,638
- Eh.
- He'll love fine dining

544
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,806
and musical theater

545
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,709
and hearing about every
explicit detail of your sex life

546
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,511
over and over and over.

547
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,512
- Just like you.

548
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,813
- Yeah, yeah, just like me.

549
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,548
- Yes, you're right.
It's gonna be fine.

550
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,817
I'm gonna be totally fine
without you.

551
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,686
I'm gonna check the distance
on the warehouse there.

552
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,687
- Copy.

553
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,856
- Yep, the building
hasn't moved.

554
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:08,894
It's still.1524 kilometers—
[groans]--away.

555
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,663
- Wait, are you just
holding up the binoculars

556
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,664
so I can't see you cry?

557
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,932
- [voice cracking] No!

558
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,900
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

559
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,035
Come to think of it,

560
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,939
I'm gonna double-check
our building distance as well.

561
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,707
Mm-hmm.

562
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,747
- I see you filming, Linetti.

563
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,449
What's in the yogurt?
- Normal stuff.

564
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,417
Nothing you'd use
to make a sidewalk with.

565
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,454
- Attention squad, I just got
word from Peralta and Boyle.

566
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,222
- Did they make their bust?
They save the precinct?

567
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,524
- No, they decided to try
to bring in a bigger fish.

568
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,525
They're not gonna
make the hearing.

569
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,560
- [sighs]

570
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,694
- So Jake's doing
the right thing

571
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,763
instead of the selfish thing?

572
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,897
You did this to him.

573
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,732
- Look, I know we all want
this precinct to survive,

574
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:47,967
but I'm proud of them.

575
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,836
Loyalty to your friends and
fellow officers is important,

576
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,640
but more important is our
loyalty to this city

577
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:55,808
and its citizens.

578
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,977
So I guess what
I'm trying to say is

579
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,846
let's go get drunk.

580
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,582
- [voice cracking]
See anything?

581
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:05,251
- [voice cracking]
Nope. You?

582
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,787
- No, I just love these
binoculars so much.

583
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,489
I don't wanna put them down,
you know?

584
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,990
- Oh, man,
when this case is over,

585
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,725
I'm gonna miss
these binoculars.

586
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,460
- Me too.

587
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,262
[knocking]

588
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,463
- It's almost 8;30.

589
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,564
We're gonna get into position.

590
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,665
- Okay, thanks, Marv.

591
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:20,633
- Are you guys crying?

592
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,903
- I said thanks, Marv!
That means move on.

593
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,908
[both clearing throat]

594
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,713
- I'm sorry that our last case
wasn't our best case ever.

595
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:36,282
- No, don't say that.

596
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,017
Every case with you
is the best case ever.

597
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,720
- Oh.

598
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:43,623
- Now come on, we still have
a drug dealer to bust, right?

599
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:44,724
You know what that means.

600
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:45,758
- Bullet tornado!
- Man sprinkler!

601
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,060
Bullet tornado,
that's what I said both times.

602
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,962
Okay, Marv,
go, go, go, go, go!

603
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,733
- NYPD! Down!
Everybody, down!

604
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,801
- Hey.

605
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,637
Congratulations
on getting the record.

606
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,938
- What are you talking about?

607
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,706
I came up short.

608
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,842
Hitchcock beat me.

609
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,043
What are all these?

610
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,545
- B&E I worked last year.

611
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,513
You noticed a clue I missed.

612
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:08,748
Arson I solved last summer.

613
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,851
You gave me advice on how to
break the guy in interrogation.

614
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,753
Blackmail from '09.

615
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:14,954
You said the nanny did it,

616
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,523
and guess what,
the nanny did it.

617
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,658
- I don't understand.

618
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,892
- You didn't just work
your own cases.

619
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,027
You helped me and Jake

620
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,262
and Charles and Amy.

621
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,632
There are hundreds of cases
that wouldn't have been solved

622
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,633
without you.

623
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,801
You add all that up,

624
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,069
that's a record nobody's
ever gonna touch.

625
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,071
Congratulations,
Mr. Nine-Nine.

626
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,839
- Thanks, Diaz.

627
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:38,010
- Hey, guys, sorry we couldn't,
you know, save the precinct.

628
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,045
- Nothing to be sorry about.

629
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,382
Your moral compass
is on fire right now.

630
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,983
- Okay, forget I said anything.
This is better.

631
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,818
- At least we had
an awesome bust.

632
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,387
- Yeah, we went back-to-back.

633
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,089
Oh, man, we must look so cool.

634
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,624
- You finally did
the man sprinkler.

635
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,092
- What?
I never called it that.

636
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,794
- Attention, squad.

637
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,696
I just got off the phone
with One Police Plaza.

638
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,997
The hearing is over,
and here's where we stand

639
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,566
vis-à-vis the precinct
being shut down.

640
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,935
The precinct
will not be shut down.

641
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,003
- Oh!
- Yeah!

642
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,971
- They decided to shut down
the Seven-Four instead.

643
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,673
- Wait, I don't understand.

644
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,709
- Apparently the community
came to our aid.

645
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,110
There was a swell
of online support

646
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,113
orchestrated by an organization
called "Gina-zone."

647
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,916
- I think you mean Ginazon.

648
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,685
I was behind the bar
the whole time.

649
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,654
Another great
Gina Linetti entrance.

650
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,723
- I told you,
you can't be back here.

651
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,591
- And I told you,
I already am.

652
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,659
- What did you do?

653
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,793
- I was live-streaming a prank

654
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,094
when Captain Holt
made his big speech

655
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,930
about how you did
the right thing for the city.

656
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:31,897
I guess people were moved.

657
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,799
They were like,
"What can we do to help?"

658
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,435
And I said, "Call
the commissioner's office."

659
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,036
- The G-Hive is real.

660
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,739
I can't believe you did it.
Gina, you're a legend.

661
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,441
To the Nine-Nine!

662
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,643
all: Nine-Nine!

663
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,815
[all groaning]
- Y'all just drank cement!

664
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,886
- Santiago,
the precinct's been saved.

665
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,887
Why are you so glum?

666
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,722
- Because our mentorship
is over.

667
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,458
I blew it all in one day.

668
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,025
- Yes, volume one
of our mentorship.

669
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,961
- There's more volumes?
- Of course.

670
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,997
You think I could fit it all
in one binder?

671
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,199
- Okay, good.

672
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,300
- You don't seem very excited.

673
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,771
- Oh, I was just adhering
to section 7, page 145.

674
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,773
"No emotional displays
in the workplace."

675
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,041
- Excellent.
I taught you well.

676
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,043
- Now if you'll excuse me,

677
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,779
I have some work to do

678
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,847
on the roof.

679
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,755
[wild cheering]

680
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,791
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
