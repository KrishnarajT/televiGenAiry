1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,904
- People have come from
all over the city to mourn.

2
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,872
The grief is palpable.

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:06,873
But the lights
from these candles

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,809
have never shone brighter.

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,812
Pizza Rat, dead tonight
at the age of four.

6
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:12,679
Kit.

7
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:13,880
- All right, Haley,
thank you for that.

8
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,882
I think it's gonna be a long,
sad night for all of us, huh?

9
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,651
- 2017 strikes again.

10
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,551
- Indeed it does.

11
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,654
In other news,
we are just days away now

12
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,590
from the start of a trial
for NYPD detectives

13
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,358
Jake Peralta and Rosa Diaz.

14
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:26,860
They were arrested
two months ago

15
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,762
for a whole string
of bank robberies.

16
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,830
- The pair are currently
out on bail

17
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,734
but, if convicted,
face up to 15 years in prison.

18
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,902
- Yeah, Anna, these disgraced
detectives were apprehended

19
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,805
after a months-long
investigation by hero cop

20
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,340
Lieutenant Melanie Hawkins.

21
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,675
- They're guilty.

22
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,343
Super duper guilty.

23
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,646
- While there is little
to no public information

24
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,881
about Detective Diaz,
Channel 12

25
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,116
has learned
this isn't the first time

26
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,719
Peralta has been
on the wrong side of the law.

27
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,921
We just uncovered
cell phone footage

28
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,123
from a Criss Angel magic show.

29
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,759
- I just want to know
how he did it.

30
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,360
He's a mind freak!

31
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,695
A mind freak!

32
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,698
[upbeat music]

33
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:11,772
â™ª

34
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,884
- Okay,
update on our trial prep.

35
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,852
This is our lawyer,
Samuel Miller,

36
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,854
who, in many ways,
is in charge of our defense.

37
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:28,689
- In every way.

38
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:29,455
- Well, "many"
is part of "every."

39
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,857
I'm facing
15 years in prison.

40
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,758
Just let me have this.

41
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,861
- Okay. So, prosecution's
case is strong.

42
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,897
You two were caught red-handed
robbing a bank

43
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,733
by one of the NYPD's
most esteemed detectives

44
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,668
in front of
two dozen eyewitnesses.

45
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,436
- Right, but
can't Captain Holt just testify

46
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:44,738
he knew you were trying to

47
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,006
take down Hawkins
from the inside?

48
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,073
- Unfortunately, no.

49
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,875
Legally you can't testify
for your best friend.

50
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:49,976
- That's not a law.
- No?

51
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,077
Sam?
- Not a law.

52
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,813
- Well, point is, he didn't deny
we're best friends.

53
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,747
- The investigation
was off the books.

54
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,882
There's no evidence
proving it even existed.

55
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,450
- Doesn't matter anyway.
We don't need your testimony,

56
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,753
because we have...
the meat fork.

57
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,754
- What?

58
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,022
- Our two-pronged defense.

59
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,190
Not unlike a fork you would use
to flip a steak on a grill.

60
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:04,991
It's a meat fork!

61
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,760
Sam, explain
the meat fork to them.

62
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,461
- Again, "meat fork" is fun,

63
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:09,730
but under no
circumstances should

64
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:10,731
anyone say that in court.

65
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,765
- We have it if we need it.

66
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,766
Tell them
about the first prong.

67
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,034
- We have airtight alibis

68
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,836
for the other three
bank robberies

69
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,203
you all are accused of.

70
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,839
- Yes, I pulled time sheets,
witness statements,

71
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:19,773
and security footage.

72
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,274
We can show that
both of you weren't present

73
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,710
at any of the
other robberies, except...

74
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,979
March 12th.
Still not sure where Rosa was.

75
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:26,780
- And you never will be.

76
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,448
- Okay, reminder:
privacy is cool,

77
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,315
but if you don't tell us,

78
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,752
we're gonna go to jail
for a long time.

79
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,019
- Fine.

80
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,487
I was at
a "La La Land" sing-along.

81
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,789
- [laughs]
- Really?

82
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,923
- What's that?
- Enough.

83
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,792
Just move on to the next prong.
- Yep.

84
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,027
- Prosecution claims
you stole $26 million,

85
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,029
but they can't trace
that money to you in any way.

86
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,231
- Yeah, I have negative $73
in my bank account.

87
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,166
Ba-boom!

88
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,500
- I'm somehow embarrassed
and proud of you

89
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,501
at the same time.

90
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:49,870
- Yeah, that's my sweet spot.

91
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:50,670
- Okay, so
that's where we stand.

92
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,238
Are there any questions
or comments?

93
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,907
- Yes, there's something
I'd like to say.

94
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:55,876
Don't lose.

95
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,978
- Thought that was
gonna be longer.

96
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,813
- I loved it.
- It was perfect.

97
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,482
- Hey, Boyle.
How you doing there, bud?

98
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,250
- I'm fine. I'm great.

99
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,451
- Well, I hear your mouth
say that,

100
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,954
but the rest of your head
is telling a different story.

101
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,522
Feels like the stress
of the upcoming trial

102
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,423
is starting to get to you.

103
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,258
- Oh, is this about
my hair turning white?

104
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,894
- Yes, definitely.

105
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,929
- It's not just
the head hair.

106
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,898
It's all of it.

107
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,033
All. Of. It.

108
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:20,934
- I get it.

109
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,068
- It's like an Eagles concert
down there.

110
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:22,869
Nothing but whites.

111
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,971
- Understood.
You got white pubes.

112
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,539
There's no need
to stress out.

113
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:27,941
The lawyer's very confident.

114
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:28,875
- Not good enough.

115
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,510
I need to do everything I can
to save Jake.

116
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,278
- Charles,
you're falling apart.

117
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,980
And that's not
helping anyone.

118
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,281
You need to get your
crap in order.

119
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:40,987
- Okay, you're right.
I'll take a nap.

120
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,890
I'll eat.
I'll dye my pubes.

121
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:44,925
- You can dye all your hair.

122
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,560
- No.
There's no time.

123
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:50,330
- Hey. Big day.
How you feeling?

124
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,264
- Good. Good.

125
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,866
I was just working on
my innocent face.

126
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,000
Check it out.

127
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,568
"I'm a nice boy."

128
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,569
- Oh, no.
I don't think that's doing

129
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:57,804
what you want it to at all.

130
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,572
- Oh.
Well, it doesn't matter,

131
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:00,874
because my normal face
is my innocent face,

132
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,774
because I'm innocent.

133
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,010
- I know.
I just hope the jury knows too.

134
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,111
Should we talk about
what happens

135
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,847
if they somehow
find you guilty?

136
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,848
- That's not happening.

137
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:08,748
But what we should talk about

138
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,916
is how we're gonna celebrate
when I win.

139
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,919
I'm thinking we take a trip
to Paris or London, Rome,

140
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:13,954
anywhere Jason Bourne

141
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,121
has driven a car
down some stairs.

142
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,090
- Paris sounds fun.
Or we could just go

143
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,391
somewhere we could
actually afford.

144
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,392
- Oh, we can afford it.

145
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,894
Don't forget I robbed a bank.

146
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,063
I'm sitting
on $26 million, baby!

147
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,064
- Excuse me?

148
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,065
- Oh!
He's just kidding.

149
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,066
- Yeah, I'm innocent.

150
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,167
You'll see when
we get in there.

151
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,369
Nice talking to you,
Judge.

152
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,904
- [sighs]
Okay, you ready?

153
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,105
- Yeah.

154
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,075
- I love you.

155
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,910
- I know.
Han Solo.

156
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,011
Love you too.

157
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,813
- You got this.

158
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,917
- You got this.

159
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,151
- You got this.

160
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,988
- Charles, you'reâ€”
- In a wheelchair, yep.

161
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,956
My back gave out
when I was dyeing my pubes.

162
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,424
I was only halfway done.

163
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,926
I'm like Cruella de Vil
down there.

164
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,960
- Okay, well,

165
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,996
I need to go be
on trial for bank robbery now,

166
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,163
so maybe we can
talk about this later?

167
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,199
- Oh, right.
Good luck.

168
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,200
- Good luck to you.

169
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,367
- About theâ€”
- Yes.

170
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,635
- Thank you.

171
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:03,937
- Okay.

172
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,207
- Psst!
[whispers] Hey, Jake.

173
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,208
I got you.
Don't worry about it.

174
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,375
- Really? How?

175
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,945
- Among my many,
many, many skills,

176
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,213
I'm fluent in face.

177
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,647
I can tell you
what the jury's thinking

178
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,548
at any given moment.

179
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,118
I see an eyebrow twitch,
I'm like, "Oh."

180
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,086
If their cheek
has a certain tension,

181
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,654
okay, that leads me
a different way.

182
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:22,822
Watch this.

183
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:26,026
Scully, you're wondering
if anyone can smell your fart.

184
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,461
The answer,
my brother, is yes.

185
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,662
- She's a witch.

186
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,097
- What'd I tell you, boy?
Trust me.

187
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,999
I got you.
- Okay.

188
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:33,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

189
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,069
I like your
stupid courtroom clothes.

190
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:36,970
- Thanks.

191
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,204
I like your
stupid courtroom clothes.

192
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,406
- Thank you.

193
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,075
You know, if you had asked me
back at the Academy

194
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,977
where I wanted to be
in 12 years,

195
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,145
I definitely would have said
right here.

196
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,980
- Same.

197
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:47,981
- Great.

198
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,115
So it all worked out.

199
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,416
End of story.

200
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,153
- All rise for the honorable
Judge Marinovich.

201
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,921
- Please.
You may be seated.

202
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:55,855
Court is in session.

203
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,457
- Now, Miss Crunder,
you were in the bank

204
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,691
at the time of the holdup.

205
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:00,126
Did you see the robbers' faces?

206
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,127
- Plain as day.

207
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,128
They're sitting right there.

208
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,063
- Let the record show,

209
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,231
she's pointing at Jake Peralta
and Rosa Diaz.

210
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,700
- Okay, the jurors found that
super compelling.

211
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,002
Just an update.

212
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,170
- Thanks, Gina.

213
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,038
- So, like, you're not
making a good first impression.

214
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,039
- Right.
Thank you.

215
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,040
- No doubt.

216
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,241
- [sighs]

217
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,477
- Hey. Don't worry.
We got this.

218
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,344
We still have our alibis.

219
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,213
We weren't at
the first three robberies.

220
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,148
- Sure, they weren't
at the first three robberies.

221
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,984
But that's just so they'd
have airtight alibis.

222
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:24,817
- Uh-oh.

223
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,019
- They were only
at the last robbery

224
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,020
'cause we were short
on manpower.

225
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,454
Our other two guys
disappeared.

226
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,956
I think those bastards
killed them.

227
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,957
- Come on.
- What?

228
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,158
- Objection.
Conjecture!

229
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,060
- Sustained.
Sorry, you say it.

230
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:34,961
- Sustained.

231
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:35,828
- We both sounded
equally authoritative.

232
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:37,463
- Prong one's
not looking so great.

233
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,099
- Well, that's why we have
a second prong.

234
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,200
They can't tie us
to the money.

235
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,036
- Just this morning,
my team uncovered

236
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,737
two accounts
from the Cayman Islands

237
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,173
controlled by Diaz and Peralta

238
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:51,044
containing $26 million
between them.

239
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,178
- [scoffs]
It's okay.

240
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,513
She has no proof.

241
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,481
- These are
the original applications

242
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,518
for the accounts
signed by Diaz and Peralta.

243
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,486
This is the affidavit
from the bank manager

244
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,123
identifying them
as the owners of the account,

245
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,992
and these are the deposit slips
for the entire amount.

246
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:06,993
- Oh, no.
Rosa,

247
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,028
we don't have
any more prongs.

248
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,029
We're prongless.

249
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,163
- Oh, and
one more thing.

250
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,197
They're guilty.

251
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,198
- No, we are not.

252
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,200
- Please don't address
the jury, Mr. Peralta.

253
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,136
- Butâ€”butâ€”but...

254
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,338
- One more "but,"
and you will be in contempt.

255
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,772
- [quietly] "One more 'but'
and you're contempt,"

256
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:21,107
name of your sex tape.

257
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,676
- Okay, I know
this looks bad.

258
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,012
But it also looked bad
for Liam Neeson in "The Grey."

259
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,780
- He got torn up by wolves
in that movie.

260
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:28,781
- That's how it ends?

261
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:29,682
Oh, man.
That is depressing.

262
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,684
Why would someone
make a movie about that?

263
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,752
- Okay, here's how
the jury's feeling

264
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,354
from left to right, L to R:

265
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,789
not a fan of Jake,
not of a fan of Rosa,

266
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,691
not a fan of me,
bathroom incidentâ€”

267
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,193
- We get it.
They all hate us.

268
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,127
- In toto, yes.

269
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,196
- Some good news.
I spoke to the judge,

270
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,765
and he's giving us an extra day
to review the new evidence.

271
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,100
- What are they gonna find
in one day?

272
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,102
Face it, man,
we are going to jail.

273
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,104
We might as well start hiding
razor blades under our tongues.

274
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,373
Here.
You can have one of mine.

275
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,740
- How long has that
been in there?

276
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,875
- Since grade school.
- Yeah, that checks out.

277
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,643
- No one's going to jail.
We're gonna work this case,

278
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,711
and we're gonna
find something.

279
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,579
You're not gonna sit back

280
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,381
and resign yourselves
to your fates.

281
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,248
You're gonna take action.

282
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,417
Now, Hawkins can
destroy your alibis

283
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,119
and put money
in your accountsâ€”

284
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,053
- Wait, sir.

285
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,055
I think Hawkins just made
her first mistake.

286
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,056
- What are you
talking about?

287
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,956
- Well, the money that
she put into our accounts

288
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,426
didn't just appear
out of thin air, right?

289
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,395
- Right. It was transferred
in from somewhere.

290
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,829
We just have to trace it
back to its source.

291
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,664
- Which would be
Lieutenant Hawkins.

292
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,832
But those are
offshore accounts.

293
00:08:19,865 --> 00:08:20,833
We can't subpoena them.

294
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,135
- So we need to break in
to the bank's computers.

295
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,136
We need a hacker.

296
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,137
- Does anyone know a hacker?

297
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,138
- Boyle does.

298
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,406
- I'm Boyle!

299
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,141
I get to help!

300
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,175
Oh, my God.

301
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,444
I can feel my legs again.

302
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,647
I can walk.

303
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,149
- Yes!
It's a miracle kind of.

304
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,683
See?
When the Nine-Nine

305
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,651
puts our brains together,
we can achieve anything.

306
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,820
Hey, we should team up
and rob banks for real!

307
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,156
- You should stop talking
in the hallway.

308
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,158
- Yep, copy that.
Nice to see you.

309
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,159
[clears throat]
Okay, Boyle,

310
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,127
tell us about your hacker.

311
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,828
- Okay, he goes by the handle
"Pandemic,"

312
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,763
and there's not a network
he can't crack.

313
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,165
He's a phantom, a ghost.

314
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,467
And only I know
where to find him.

315
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,835
- Welcome to Hey, Hey,
It's Wednesday's!

316
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,837
where it's never
the weekend.

317
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,672
Be right with ya.

318
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,207
- Are you sure about this
hacker, Charles?

319
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,775
I'm not getting a strong
"Mr. Robot" vibe

320
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,576
from this place.

321
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,477
- Yeah, that's because
the only thing

322
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,447
Pandemic loves more
than hackin' computers

323
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,882
is hackin' into
a big old fried onion.

324
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:10,783
Oh, there he is.

325
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,154
- Hey guys, welcome
to the Quarantine.

326
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,721
Help yourselves to
some potstickers.

327
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:16,589
Best eaten when hot.

328
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,224
- No thanks.
Here are the account numbers

329
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,825
for the bank where
the money showed up.

330
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,261
Now, we're in a real hurry.

331
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,795
You think you can trace it
back to its source?

332
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,497
- Are you questioning
my abilities?

333
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,532
Watch this.
What's your name?

334
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,701
- Why do you needâ€”
- Terrence Vincent Jeffords.

335
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,902
- Wait.
What's happening?

336
00:09:29,935 --> 00:09:30,903
- You're getting hacked,
bro.

337
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:31,904
That's what's happening.

338
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,739
- Don't do that.
- I'm in your home computer.

339
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,740
- You are? Get out.

340
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,909
- You got a lot of songs
by Natalie Imbruglia.

341
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,878
- Uh, I bought those
back in the '90s.

342
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,712
- Nope.
Downloaded on Thursday.

343
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,748
Okay, now watch
the Pandemic spread.

344
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,285
There's a document in here
that looks to be fan fiction

345
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,919
for the show
"Madam Secretary."

346
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:48,288
- Oh, Sarge,
I didn't know

347
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,223
you were a fan of the Madam.

348
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,791
- The show leaves Terry
wanting more.

349
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,293
I'm just filling in the gaps!

350
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,827
Now get to hacking.

351
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,497
- Guys,
I think I found something.

352
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,431
- Is it my heart medicine?

353
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,300
My doctor said that
if I miss even one dose,

354
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,534
I could have a massive stroâ€”

355
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,303
- No, Scully,
this is important.

356
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,837
I was going through
the arrest reports

357
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,506
filed by everyone
in Hawkins' squad.

358
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,507
- We already
went over these.

359
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,509
- Right, but there was
one guy we didn't flag

360
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,843
because he was never
the arresting officer:

361
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,512
Detective Matthew Langdon.

362
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,946
I think something went down
between him and Hawkins.

363
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:15,748
- Well, he had a stellar
14-year career

364
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,849
Before joining
Hawkins's squad.

365
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,820
Then, three months later,
he quit the force entirely.

366
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,755
- He didn't just quit.
He disappeared.

367
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,224
No tax records.
No known address.

368
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,192
His wife filed
a missing persons report.

369
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,761
But after doing
some incredible sleuthing,

370
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,330
I think I figured out
where he is.

371
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,764
Ames,
how would you like to take

372
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,266
a romantic trip
to the town of...

373
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,567
"Horseditch, Pennsylvania"?

374
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,568
- Ooh.

375
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,602
The Paris of the mud belt?

376
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,603
Oui, oui.

377
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,838
- [laughs]
Wee-wee.

378
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:39,839
Anyway, it's huge stakes.

379
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:40,873
We should get going.

380
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,242
- Good luck.

381
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,509
Has anyone seen Diaz?

382
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:44,910
She's supposed be looking into
the first two bank robberies.

383
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,279
- I saw her
outside the courthouse.

384
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,281
She gave me her jacket

385
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,815
and her motorcycle helmet.

386
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,551
- Why would she give you
her favorite jacket?

387
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,386
- Because I'm a rebel,
and we're in love.

388
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,620
Doi.

389
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,823
[knock at door]

390
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,225
- Diaz,
I've been calling you.

391
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,293
Why weren't you
answering your phone?

392
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,361
- Don't have it.

393
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:01,994
I charged it and stuck
it on a truck headed west.

394
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:03,062
- What's with the suitcase?

395
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:03,996
- Going to Malaysia.
- You're going to Malaysia?

396
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,831
- No, the suitcase
is going to Malaysia.

397
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,632
I'm getting on a bus
to Florida.

398
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,433
- What's in Florida?

399
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,834
- Airport.
I'm flying to Argentina.

400
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,303
- This is very complicated.
- Thank you.

401
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,170
Adrian has a ranch in the Andes

402
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,272
where he goes
when he's on the run.

403
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,974
He's already there,
getting rid of the scorpions.

404
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,842
Or adding more scorpions.

405
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,411
I don't know.
The reception was real bad.

406
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,845
- Diaz, I know you're scared,

407
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,913
but things are
starting to turn around.

408
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,315
We're on the money trail,

409
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,816
and we just found a new lead.

410
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,950
- With all due respect, sir,

411
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,287
both you and I know that
none of that is gonna pan out.

412
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,954
And you said yourself
I should take action.

413
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,856
So I am, in Argentina,

414
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,392
surrounded by scorpions.

415
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,593
Or not surrounded
by scorpions.

416
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,594
I'll find out when
I get there.

417
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,362
- Look.
I know you're innocent,

418
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,331
but fleeing the country
is a crime.

419
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,832
I could arrest you right here.

420
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,233
- Do it then.

421
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,637
I didn't think so.

422
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,308
The mortgage is paid off.

423
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,609
You can give the place
to whoever you want.

424
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,710
I don't care.

425
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,880
Actually, I do care.

426
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,682
Don't give it to Hitchcock.

427
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,354
- I'll have the Mid-Week
Potato Leak soup,

428
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,855
and he'll have a
"There's Work Tomorrow

429
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,757
So Be Cool Frozen Margarita."

430
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,859
- Who are you?

431
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,027
- You can call me Nightmare.

432
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,296
But for check writing purposes,
it's Jennifer Huggins.

433
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,631
- The bank's encryption
turned out to be

434
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,965
more secure than I thought,

435
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:13,766
so I had to bring in a friend.

436
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,035
- Just tell us
if this is impossible.

437
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,002
We don't have
a lot of time to waste,

438
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,639
and we've been here, like,
five hours already.

439
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,874
- Huh. You don't think
I can do this?

440
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,042
Is it because I'm a woman?

441
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,976
- No, no, I didn't say that.

442
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,878
- I think women are amazing.
- Thank you.

443
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,046
And now I'm about to
hack your world

444
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,681
into pieces, old man.

445
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,582
That'll show you.

446
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:30,983
- No. Just do the thing
with the bank.

447
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,652
That'll show me.
- Whoa.

448
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,987
Looks like someone
was a catalog model in Japan.

449
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,656
- Whoa!
Those boots.

450
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,690
That slicker.

451
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,325
The no pants.

452
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,394
Who's the target audience
for these pics, Sarge?

453
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,728
- I was a starving student.

454
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,897
Terry needed the yen!

455
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,066
- Babe, are you sure
we're in the right place?

456
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,901
This looks like
where they shot "The Village."

457
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,470
- Amy, don't say things
like that.

458
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,937
You're gonna scare me.
You know that.

459
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,474
I think Langdon's wife's
been secretly visiting him.

460
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,742
She posted a photo in March
of a snowstorm,

461
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,678
but there was no snow
in New York.

462
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,681
The picture was geotagged
right...

463
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,915
here.

464
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,717
- "Flaxton Hill Farms."

465
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,019
- Check it out.
There's a car in the driveway.

466
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,454
Somebody's home.

467
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,024
- Matthew Langdon?
Are you there?

468
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,527
We'd like to talk to you
about Melanie Hawkins.

469
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,929
[gun cocks]
Whoa!

470
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,930
Don't shoot!

471
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,799
But seriously, don't.
Don't shoot.

472
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,406
- If I were you, I'd turn around
and start walking.

473
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,675
Because in about three seconds,
I'm gonna start shooting.

474
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,544
[gun cocks]
- Oh, God. He did the gun cock.

475
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,378
This is escalating
much too quickly,

476
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,579
and three seconds
is not enough timeâ€”

477
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,680
- Jakeâ€”
- Right, focus. Sorry.

478
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,682
Sir, we know you
worked with Hawkins.

479
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,683
- Did she send you here?

480
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:38,684
- No.
- No.

481
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:40,019
- We're not with her.

482
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,421
We're like
the opposite of that.

483
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,422
She set me and my friend up.

484
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,423
We could go to jail.

485
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,024
- Why should I believe you?

486
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,092
- Look, if you let me slowly
reach into my jacket pocket,

487
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,528
there's an article
open on my phone

488
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,431
that will explain everything.

489
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:54,434
- That's a video
of a monkey humping a frog.

490
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,435
- [scoffs]
- What?

491
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:56,702
Oh. [laughs]
That's my bad.

492
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:58,704
It was a long ride up here,
and I got bored.

493
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,440
Here.
Close that tab.

494
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,441
That's the article.

495
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,442
- Hawkins ran you
out of New York

496
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,476
and took away your life.

497
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,045
If you help us, maybe we
can help you get it back.

498
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,113
- Fine. I'll talk to you,

499
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,583
but you gotta follow me;
I gotta go feed the hogs.

500
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,584
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna feed them?

501
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,585
Is it us?

502
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,586
- Corn.

503
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,587
- Hmm, corn.

504
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,722
Maize, as there was
at the first Thanksgiving.

505
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:17,723
- Jake.
- Right.

506
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:18,724
- Let's go talk.

507
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,426
- All right, guys.

508
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,427
Let's order a round
of "Hey, Hey,

509
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,162
It's Light Beer, Light Beer"
and get into it.

510
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,163
- Um, who is this guy?

511
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,131
- These offshore banks
are incredibly secure,

512
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,733
so we needed more manpower.

513
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,469
- But what makes you think
that he would beâ€”

514
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,604
- Charles, don't talk.

515
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,705
Do not challenge

516
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,475
this very capable gentleman
in any way.

517
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,476
Just let him get to work.

518
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,710
- Okay, thanks.

519
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,745
- So you understand we're not
questioning your ability at all.

520
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,780
- Of course not.

521
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,748
But I don't know you guys,
so just to be safe,

522
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,485
I did dig up some dirt on you
to use as blackmail

523
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,752
in case things go south.

524
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:48,120
- On both of us?

525
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:48,954
- Just Terry Jeffords.
- Yup.

526
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,223
- Or should I say
Sir-Dance-Alot?

527
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,492
- Oh, come on!

528
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:53,559
Turn the volume up!

529
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,462
Mommy can't hear us
in Da Bassment.

530
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,498
- Oof.
That's embarrassing.

531
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,734
Sarge, you gotta scrub-a-dub-dub
that profile.

532
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,504
- Oof.
It's pungent out here.

533
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,671
It's so weird how food
smells so good

534
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,206
but farms smell so bad.

535
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,241
- Yeah, I think that
every day.

536
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,743
- So... Hawkins?

537
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,646
- I caught her taking payoffs
from a gang leader.

538
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,481
When I confronted her about it,

539
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,783
she said I could disappear
or she'd kill me.

540
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,184
- I see why you chose
pig farming.

541
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,219
It's better than death.

542
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,654
- Not during the spring thaw.

543
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,689
- Why? Does it smell
even worse somehow?

544
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,591
- I was talking
about the noises.

545
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,192
It's pig mating season.

546
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:29,529
- What does that sound like,
a bunch of wet bagpipes?

547
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,630
- That's exactly it.

548
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,765
- Oh. Nailed it.
- Hey. Yeah.

549
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:33,465
- The worst part
about it is,

550
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,668
I had to
leave my wife behind.

551
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,538
If Hawkins knew
we were still together,

552
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,805
I'm afraid she'll kill her.

553
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,240
- If you testify to this
in court,

554
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,510
it would back up everything
Jake and Rosa are saying.

555
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,645
It could sway the jury.

556
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,780
You could take Hawkins down
and get your life back.

557
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:52,217
- I've tangled with her enough
to know that she always wins.

558
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,519
So it's a no.

559
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,287
- Come on.
You're our last chance.

560
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,656
- I can't help you.

561
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,257
That's final.

562
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,659
- Oh, my God.

563
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,598
- Is this seat taken?

564
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,800
You really gonna
do this, Diaz?

565
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,569
- My name
is Rachel Weinstein.

566
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,704
I am a graduate student
on sabbatical to study birds

567
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,639
at the University
of Buenos Aires.

568
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,807
- You know,
Cornell has a far better

569
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,308
ornithology department,

570
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,177
and it's right here in New York.

571
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,812
- Cornell has accused me
of robbing a bank

572
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,847
and is gonna send me to jail
for 15 years.

573
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:22,848
- I guess we're dropping
the metaphor.

574
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:23,649
- I don't know
why you're here.

575
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:24,850
You're not gonna
change my mind.

576
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,819
- I know.

577
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,287
I just wanted
to say good-bye.

578
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,321
- Okay. Good-bye.

579
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:30,255
- I hope you know
your family's gonna miss you.

580
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,858
- I don't care.
I barely speak to them.

581
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:35,260
- I was talking about
the Nine-Nine.

582
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,296
Be safe,
Rachel Weinstein.

583
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,769
- I guess now we have to
actually talk about

584
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,738
what happens
if the jury finds me guilty.

585
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,272
- They still might not.

586
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,608
We could still go to Paris.

587
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,275
- Forget Paris.

588
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,777
Billy Crystal.
Nailed it.

589
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:52,778
- I'll wait for you.

590
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:53,879
And I'll keep fighting for you

591
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:56,281
and so will everyone
at the Nine-Nine.

592
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,585
We'll do whatever it takes.

593
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,220
I love you.

594
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,321
- I love you.

595
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,689
- Okay.

596
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,290
Let's go back to New York.
- [sighs]

597
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,358
[engine turns over]
- You can choose the music.

598
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,227
- Just put on
anything by Enya.

599
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,596
No, not anything.
"Orinoco Flow." On repeat.

600
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,897
- Okay.
[loud tapping]

601
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:12,965
- Wait.

602
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,636
I'm coming with you.

603
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,237
- You are?
You'll testify?

604
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,905
- Hawkins has cost
me and my wife

605
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,807
too many years of happiness.

606
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,909
I'm not gonna let her
do the same to you.

607
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,778
- Thank you so much.

608
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,846
- Well, I'm gonna grab my stuff,

609
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,781
and I'll get a few CDs.

610
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,282
Hope you like Enya.

611
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,316
- [gasps]

612
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,953
Matthew Langdon,
you and I are vibing so hard!

613
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,926
- Where are Jake and Rosa?

614
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,927
- I don't know.

615
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,728
I'm getting worried,

616
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,929
because the jury's
getting restless,

617
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,130
especially juror number 4.

618
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,866
She'd rather be
in Lake Havasu

619
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,100
with her new boyfriend,
Derek.

620
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,168
I didn't get that
from her face.

621
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,804
I was eavesdropping
by the vending machine, soâ€”

622
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,172
- I just got a text
from Peralta.

623
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,940
He's a few minutes away.
- And Diaz?

624
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,709
- Perhaps a bit more
than a few minutes away.

625
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,043
I think there's a chanceâ€”
- I'm here!

626
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,144
Sorry, traffic was
a nightmare

627
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,113
coming back
from Philadelphia...

628
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,048
cheesesteak restaurant.

629
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,717
They do breakfast.
It checks out.

630
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,151
- Okay.

631
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,022
- So what happened?

632
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,124
- I guess I wasn't ready
to say good-bye to my family.

633
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,994
- Good.

634
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,096
Neither were we.

635
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,164
- Now what I'm picking up on
is just a genuine moment

636
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,067
of friendship
and respect.

637
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,136
And now I'm feeling like

638
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,071
you wish I would stop
analyzing you

639
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,940
'cause I'm ruining
the moment.

640
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,175
But you guys
are so cute.

641
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,176
I love you.

642
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,113
- All rise for the honorable
Judge Marinovich.

643
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,081
- Please, be seated.
The court is in session.

644
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,917
Counselor, where is Mr. Peralta?

645
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,084
- Objection!

646
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,087
[Enya's "Orinoco Flow" playing]

647
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:49,194
â™ª

648
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,963
[gavel bangs]
- Mr. Peralta,

649
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,065
what is the meaning of this?

650
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,200
- Your Honor, I'd like to call
a surprise witness.

651
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,769
- You're not an attorney.

652
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,038
- Right.
Sam, call a surprise witness.

653
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,906
- Okay.
Uh...

654
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,075
We'd like to call
a surprise witness.

655
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,010
- The jury's like,
"Oh, snap, a twist."

656
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,045
Like, they love twists.

657
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,080
Any great trial has a twist.

658
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,114
- I'm getting worried.

659
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:09,982
We're running out of time.

660
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,017
- It's fine.
This place is open 24-5.

661
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,786
Only closed on weekends.

662
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,054
- Such a strange theme
for a restaurant.

663
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,789
- Agreed.
But that's not what I meant.

664
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,090
Did you guys
find anything yet?

665
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,992
- Yes.
Terry made a sizable purchase

666
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,027
at an Etsy store
that sells anklets for men.

667
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,063
- [laughs]
- Sharon thinks they're sexy.

668
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,065
Oh, come on!
Focus on the case, man.

669
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,232
- Hey, hey, hey!
I'm in!

670
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,068
- Can you state your name
for the record?

671
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,970
- My name is Matthew Langdon.

672
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,938
- Mr. Langdon, do you know
Melanie Hawkins?

673
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:37,843
- Yes. I worked for her
for three months in 2010.

674
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,044
- And you are a retired...
- [mouthing words]

675
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,180
- NYPD detective, correct?
- [mouthing words]

676
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,815
- Yes, I served for 14 years.
[both mouthing words]

677
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,916
- Gotcha!

678
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,852
Sorry.

679
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,087
Proceed.

680
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,088
- The money
that was deposited

681
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,089
was routed through
five banks.

682
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,124
Now, I can't link it to Hawkins,

683
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,827
but the original transfer
came from this shell corp.

684
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,095
- Huh.
Doesn't ring a bell.

685
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,229
- I'll text the squad,

686
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,931
see if anyone recognizes it.

687
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,233
"Flaxton Hill Holdings."

688
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,968
[phone buzzes]

689
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,904
- "Flaxton Hill"?

690
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:05,938
Oh, no.

691
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,173
Flaxton Hill Farms.

692
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,308
Jake! Jake! Jake!

693
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,175
This was a mistake.

694
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,844
We have to get Langdon
off the stand now.

695
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,778
- What?
Why?

696
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,013
- And how would you describe
the Lieutenant?

697
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,014
- He works for Hawkins.

698
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,849
He put the money
in the accounts.

699
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,983
- Oh, no.

700
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,018
- Melanie Hawkins

701
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,954
was the most honorable cop
I ever worked with.

702
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,123
And the only reason
that I'm here

703
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,291
is because of that man,
Jake Peralta.

704
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:31,864
He offered me $300,000 to lie
and say that she set 'em up.

705
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,066
[jury gasping]

706
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,068
- Okay, okay, this is bad.
This is really bad.

707
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,871
But just remember,
we are not going to jail.

708
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,873
We didn't do it.
We're innocent.

709
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,874
- Guilty.

710
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,108
[all gasping]
On all charges.

711
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,209
[all murmuring]

712
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,310
- Oh.

713
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,046
Guilty.

714
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,147
Very cool.

715
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,016
Cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

716
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,086
[repeating "cool" rapidly]

717
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,023
[continues repeating "cool"
rapidly]

718
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,091
Cool.

719
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,262
- Fremulon.

720
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,330
- Not a doctor.
Shh!
