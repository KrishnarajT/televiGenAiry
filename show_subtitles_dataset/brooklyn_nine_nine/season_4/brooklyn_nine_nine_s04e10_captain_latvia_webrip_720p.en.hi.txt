when I saw you
standing over there

514
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,384
in your underwear?

515
00:17:58,418 --> 00:17:59,819
- That my butt is like
a sexy piece of drywall?

516
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,621
- What?
No, eww.

517
00:18:01,654 --> 00:18:03,723
- You guys gonna be much longer?
It's Christmas Eve.

518
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:04,990
- Just give us one sec, Marv.

519
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,659
No, what I realized is,
the best gift

520
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,828
you can give Nikolaj
is not Captain Latvia.

521
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,830
- What?
- It's you, being there

522
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:13,566
with him, alive.
- But I promised him...

523
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,567
- Yeah, but you
also promised him

524
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,436
you were gonna be his father.
- I'm worried

525
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,838
we're gonna lose tactical.
- Back off, Marv, we get it.

526
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,540
- Come on, Marvin.
- Look, we can handle this

527
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:22,808
without you—just go home.
- Thanks, Jake.

528
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:24,710
And I'm sorry I said
you'll never be a dad.

529
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,912
You will be, and you can
make it happen tonight.

530
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:29,549
Just go to Amy and make sure
afterwards that she holds

531
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:30,416
her knees to her chest
for at least—

532
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,817
- All right,
I think I'm good on this.

533
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:33,819
- Okay.
- Yeah.

534
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:35,020
[sighs]

535
00:18:35,054 --> 00:18:37,022
[tense music]

536
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:38,991
All right, Marv,

537
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:39,992
be honest with me.

538
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:41,461
What do you think of this shirt?

539
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:42,662
- It's a little inappropriate.

540
00:18:42,695 --> 00:18:43,996
- I knew it.
All right,

541
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,831
let's just go on three.
Ready?

542
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,901
One, two, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

543
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:51,070
- Once again,
the MTA has bested us.

544
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:53,539
We should never have trusted
a Hoboken drunk.

545
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:57,843
- "Hamilton" was amazing!

546
00:18:57,877 --> 00:18:59,712
How is no one talking about
this musical?

547
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:01,547
It's so good.

548
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:05,651
Wow, you guys look more upset
than Aaron Burr, sir.

549
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:06,886
That's from the musical
"Hamilton,"

550
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:08,721
which I just discovered,
basically.

551
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,122
- We lost the caroling
competition.

552
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:11,657
- And now we hate singing.

553
00:19:11,691 --> 00:19:13,593
- Almost as much as
we hate the MTA.

554
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:15,127
- Yeah, so we should prank call
their tip line

555
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,962
with a series of
well-crafted insults.

556
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:19,599
- We should toilet paper
their houses.

557
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:22,034
- With rocks.
- Come on, guys.

558
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,837
Getting back at people isn't
what Christmas is all about.

559
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,839
It's about being together,
as a family.

560
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:29,642
So you can plot your petty
revenge, but I, for one,

561
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:32,645
am gonna carol my heart out.

562
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:33,879
- I'm sorry, I didn't hear
a word you just said.

563
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:36,582
That stain on your pants looks
exactly like Bryan Cranston.

564
00:19:36,616 --> 00:19:38,083
- That's who it is.
- Ooh, that's right.

565
00:19:38,117 --> 00:19:39,084
- Yeah, been staring at it
for an hour.

566
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:40,085
- That's it.
- Oh.

567
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,054
[knocking]

568
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:44,757
- Hey.
- Jake, what happened?

569
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,125
- Well, we arrested 12 guys,

570
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:48,027
confiscated 35
automatic weapons,

571
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,629
and I found Captain Latvia.

572
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:50,630
- You did?
Oh, my God!

573
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:53,633
- Uh, melted.
I found him extremely melted.

574
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,700
And grotesque.
Probably should've

575
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:57,703
strung that together faster.
- Well, that's okay.

576
00:19:57,737 --> 00:19:59,639
You taught me that Christmas
isn't about presents.

577
00:19:59,672 --> 00:20:01,774
- No, forget all that crap.
Presents rule.

578
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:04,777
Here, give him this.
From you.

579
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,780
- It's a police man,
just like you, Papa.

580
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:09,582
This is the
coolest present ever.

581
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,684
"I'm Detective Papa,
and I'm going to go

582
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:14,654
to the Farmers Market.
I hope they have aged Gouda."

583
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:17,189
- Oh, my God,
I'm melting.

584
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:19,091
I'm literally
turning into a puddle.

585
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:20,125
Genevieve, hold me.

586
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,127
- I got you, babe.

587
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:25,998
Oh, honey, that flat ass is
perched right on top of my ute.

588
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:27,166
- I'm gonna pretend
none of that was said

589
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,601
for the sake of the child.

590

- Cool, so you're just
out here caroling solo?

597
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,622
- Yeah,
I guess you could say that.

598
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:51,824
- No, you can't.
He's not solo.

599
