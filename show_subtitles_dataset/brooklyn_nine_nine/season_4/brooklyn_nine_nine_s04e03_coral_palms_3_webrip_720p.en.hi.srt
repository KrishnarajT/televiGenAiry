- What?
- I'm done.

180
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,162
I've sewn myself up.

181
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,930
- Huh.
- You did great, buddy.

182
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:55,331
I'm proud of you.
- [exhales]

183
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:57,734
I can't believe I did it.

184
00:05:57,768 --> 00:05:59,035
I'm so strong.

185
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,937
- Ooh, we're crossing
into Virginia.

186
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:03,506
Fun fact: Virginia is not
technically a state,

187
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,808
but a commonwealth.

188
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:05,675
- Oof, poor Jake.

189
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,744
- Uhh, this might be
the Ambies speaking,

190
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:10,013
but this in-flight movie sucks.

191
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:12,182
- So, uh, you already
moved the twins

192
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:13,984
onto a booster seat, huh?

193
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:15,018
Aren't they a little
young for that?

194
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,019
- They're four.

195
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:17,120
- Nikolaj is four,

196
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:18,288
but we're sticking
with the car seat

197
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:20,290
as long as possible,
but you know me—

198
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:21,892
I'm a "safety at all costs"
kind of dad.

199
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:22,725
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,094
- Sarge, I need to go
to the bathroom.

201
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:25,361
- We just stopped for gas.

202
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:26,362
I asked you if you had to go.

203
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,330
- I didn't have to then.

204
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:30,233
- So does this van have
side-impact airbags?

205
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:31,234
- Not in the back.

206
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,936
- Oh. Interesting.

207
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:34,037
No judgment here.

208
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,305
- Sarge, I have to pee now too.

209
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:37,774
- Seriously?
You, Diaz?

210
00:06:37,808 --> 00:06:39,843
Look, I'll turn off
at the next exit, okay?

211
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:40,944
- I have to pee really badly.

212
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:42,145
- Hot.

213
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:43,346
- What?
- Hitchcock!

214
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,981
- Guys, enough!
- Sarge—

215
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:46,382
- Yeah, I know!
You got to pee, I got it!

216
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,051
- No, brake lights!
- Oh, crap.

217
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:49,953
- Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!

218
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:50,987
[crunch]

219
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,124
- Did you get breakfast?

220
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:57,027
- I tried, but I got recognized.

221
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,062
- Do I know you
from somewhere?

222
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:01,231
- Do you watch a lot
of pornography?

223
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:03,834
'Cause I'm in most of it.

224
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:06,002
- Oh, boy.
What if you were followed?

225
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:07,270
I don't think it's safe
to stay here.

226
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,271
- Where are we gonna go?

227
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,240
[heavy bang]

228
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:11,942
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!

229
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:12,809
Do we have any weapons?

230
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:13,810
- I have the pipe
we pulled out of me.

231
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:16,279
- I would sooner surrender
than go anywhere near

232
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,881
your gooey body pipe.

233
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:20,150
Oh, no, I'm gonna do it.

234
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:22,052
[whimpering]

235
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:24,120
Oh!
- Jake?

236
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:25,421
- Amy—
[rasping]

237
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:26,890
It's so good to see you.

238
00:07:26,923 --> 00:07:27,924
[wheezing]

239
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:33,163
- Thank you guys
so much for coming.

240
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:34,297
I can't wait to catch up
with all of you

241
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,298
when this is done.

242
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:36,366
- My dad died, and—

243
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:38,168
- Again, when this is done,
Hitchcock.

244
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,502
Gina, you look like
a fresh wizard,

245
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:40,971
and I love it.

246
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:42,973
So we know that Figgis
is in Coral Palms,

247
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,007
but we don't know where he is,

248
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,142
and we don't know how many
guys he's got with him.

249
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:48,411
The plan is to lure them into
the Fun Zone and ambush them.

250
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:50,914
Any questions?
- Yes, did you miss us?

251
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:52,883
Quick follow-up: did you ever
look up at the moon

252
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,517
and wonder if I was
looking at it too?

253
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,186
- Yes.
- Knew it.

254
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:57,988
- All right, once we get
to the Fun Zone,

255
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,890
I'll fill everyone in
on the mission details.

256
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:01,124
You guys come with me.

257
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:02,458
Captain, you stay here and rest.

258
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:04,427
- What?
I don't need to rest.

259
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,062
I'm in peak condition.

260
00:08:06,096 --> 00:08:07,097
- All right, then stand up.

261
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,098
- Easy.

262
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,399

[grunts]

265
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:14,404
I love standing up.

266
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:15,471
- Yeah, you're staying here.

267
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:18,041
- Aw, Captain,
don't worry, okay?

268
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,276
My sleeping pills
are doing their job,

269
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,279
and I can stay here
and take care of you, okay?

270
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:25,081
Terry, I'm gonna
need your gun.

271
00:08:25,115 --> 00:08:26,082
- That's not happening.

272
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:27,417
- All right, I'll use my own.

273
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,152
Oops-a-daisy.

274
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:31,154
- That is adorable.
Where did you get that?

275
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:32,956
- Vending machine
at a rest stop.

276
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:35,458
- Give me that.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.

277
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:38,161
And stay on your phone for
logistical support as planned.

278
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:39,429
Now come on, guys,
let's get ready.

279
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:45,168
- Hey, we never really
got a chance to say hi.

280
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,970
- Yeah. Hi.

281
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:48,204
- Hi.

282
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:50,073
- Oh, my God, everyone,

283
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:51,174
Jake and Amy are going to kiss

284
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:52,976
for the first time
in six months.

285
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,978
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.

286
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:57,247
- So everyone's just
gonna watch us?

287
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,349
- Yes!
Now get to it, you lovebirds.

288
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:03,086
Here we go.

289
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,120
- Come on, man.

290
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:05,388
- How did you get there so fast?

291
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,423
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.

292
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:09,459
- Welcome to the Fun Zone.

293
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:11,327
I know the manager, and he's
agreed to shut the place down

294
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:13,396
for the day, so there won't
be any civilians around.

295
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:14,397
- Smart.

296
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,498
You put up all these fake signs

297
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:17,067
about a major
health code violation.

298
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,334
- No, those are actually
always there—

299
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:20,570
something about lead being in
the air and water and ground.

300
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,338
Anyways, you all have
your assignments.

301
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:23,974
Let's plan an ambush.

Nine-Nine!
all: Nine-Nine!

303
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:27,343
- Chills, you guys.

00:09:27,377 --> 00:09:29,512
Literally, chills.

[video call dings]

306
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,415

It's your papa.

something bad has
happened to me.

310
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:39,422
But I want you to know
that I love you very much.

311
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,992
- You want to stop filming
yourself and help me with

312
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:43,226
these many items I'm carrying?

313
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:45,628
- Sorry, I was making
a video for my son.

314
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,298
You know, in case
I never see him again.

315
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,533
Do you not do that
for your kids?

316
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:52,102
- Of course I do.

317
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,504
I make those kind of videos
all the time.

318
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:58,074
You know, in fact, I was about
to do one right now.

Hey—hey, girls.

It's me, Daddy.

But I want you to know that
I love you now and forever.

I mean, no.

Just concentrate on Figgis,
and we'll figure this out later.

maybe we should talk,
