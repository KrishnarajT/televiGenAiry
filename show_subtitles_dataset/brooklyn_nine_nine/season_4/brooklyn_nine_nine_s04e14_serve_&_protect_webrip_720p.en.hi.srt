1
00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:02,666
- All right everyone,
as you know,

2
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:05,702
the NYPD intends to shutter
one precinct in Brooklyn.

3
00:00:05,736 --> 00:00:07,471
I'll be evaluating
the Nine-Nine

4
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:10,507
and sending my findings
to the Deputy Commissioner.

5
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,209
Are there any questions?

6
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:14,711
- Yeah, Veronica, are you
sure you're the best person

7
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,981
for that job, given
our, um, you know...

8
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:19,983
- Sexual past.
- Thank you, Detective Boyle.

9
00:00:20,016 --> 00:00:21,718
- Sergeant Jeffords,
don't be silly.

10
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:24,421
I won't let the fact that you
and I have a history together

11
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:25,689
affect the decision
I have to make

12
00:00:25,722 --> 00:00:27,624
in any way whatsoever.

13
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:28,892
- Well that's certainly
good to hear.

14
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:32,429
- I mean, sure, it took me years
of intense therapy to get over

15
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:34,431
and it's given me
a fear of intimacy

16
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:37,701
that has affected
every subsequent relationship,

17
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:41,572
but there's no reason
I can't remain unbiased.

18
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,006
- The way you just said that
makes it seem

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,508
like you actually are biased.

20
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:48,445
- [menacingly]
I have no idea what you mean.

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,315
That is all.

22
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:52,749
- Okay, the plan is clear.

23
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:55,319
Sarge, you divorce Sharon,
abandon your children,

24
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:56,420
get back together
with that monster.

25
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:58,489
The precinct is saved.
- I'm not leaving my family.

26
00:00:58,522 --> 00:00:59,823

You didn't even consider it!

Ah, screw this.

Not again!

What is going on here?

33
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:30,321
- Stupid printer won't print out
my stupid resume

34
00:01:30,354 --> 00:01:33,023
which means I can't send it
to any decent stupid precincts

Be a good cop, do your job,
things'll work out.

45
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,375
- Yep, just this morning,
I found this old bag

46
00:01:51,408 --> 00:01:53,710
on the street
and it has a cupcake inside.

47
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:56,079

Involving one
Ms. Cassie Sinclair.

00:02:00,684 --> 00:02:01,885
- From "Serve & Protect"?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:03,720
- That is my favorite cop show.
- Yeah.

52
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:05,756
Apparently her laptop was stolen
and it had...

53
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,424
"sensitive materials" on it.

00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:08,692
You know what that's code for...

- Bank account numbers.
- Nudies!

I'm not a pervert.

The point is, Gloomy Gus,

00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:14,565
not everything is terrible.
- Maybe you're right.

59
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:15,666
Maybe life isn't
a miserable, unending,

60
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,734
maggot-filled pile of crap.
- Yeah, there you go.

61
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:19,670
Let's go find some nudies
or bank account numbers—

62
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:20,671
both would be helpful.

63
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:23,440
- Guys, we gotta do something
about Veronica.

64
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:24,641
She's really out to get us.

65
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:26,843
- We just need to find out
what horrible thing Terry did

66
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:29,580
to this woman so he can
apologize and make it right.

67
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:31,915
- I've been wracking my brain.
I can't think of anything.

68
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:34,385
- Did you cheat on her?
- No! I would never do that.

69
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:35,552
- Did you date
one of her friends

70
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:36,820
right after you broke up?
- Uh-uh.

71
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:39,656
I cut off ties with
all our mutual friends.

Even Tommy.
Terry loved Tommy!

73
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,760
Tommy turned Terry on to tennis.

74
00:02:43,794 --> 00:02:44,895
- Well, you did
something to her.

75
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:47,764
We'll just have to get Veronica
to tell us what it was.

00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:49,132
It's time for
a little girl talk.

77
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:50,667
- You really think
you can handle girl talk?

78
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,669
- Relax. I got this.

79
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:56,607
Hey Veronica.
It's time for some girl talk.

81
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,445
- Excuse me?

82
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:03,480
- Didn't work.
What else we got?

83
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:06,883
- Hey! Huh?

84
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:09,786
- Whoa, this is dope.
- Dope it right.

85
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,688
Welcome to the dream factory.
- Hey, man.

86
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:13,390
We gotta be cool, all right?

87
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,459
I know you have some fantasy
about being a movie star.

88
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:16,860
- I don't fantasize
about being a movie star.

89
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:18,729
I fantasize about meeting one.

90
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:20,897
And being invited to a party
at George Clooney's villa,

91
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:24,601
where he pranks me and then
we prank Matt Damon together

92
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:26,637
and then Damon's like
"Peralta, you got the goods.

93
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,971
You're gonna be the star
of my next movie."

94
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:29,606
Wait, maybe I do
want to be a movie star.

95
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,607
- Heads up. Here she comes.
- Okay.

96
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,443
- Hey.
- Ms. Sinclair.

97
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:33,810
I'm Detective Diaz.
This is Detective Peralta.

98
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:35,812
- Oh, I like the way
you wear your badge.

99
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:37,681
Can I steal that?
- Absolutely.

100
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:39,916
Oh, hey, here's another little
nugget for you, if you'd like.

101
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,619
[clears throat] Thanks
for coming down to the precinct.

102
00:03:42,653 --> 00:03:45,889
Oh, and one more thing...
I'm a cop.

103
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,792
- Wouldn't the person
already know that

104
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,194
if they were at the precinct?
- No, it works.

105
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,830
So you had your laptop stolen?
- Yeah, last night.

106
00:03:53,864 --> 00:03:56,500
Someone broke into my trailer,
jimmied the lock.

107
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,201
I found out this morning
from the second A.D.

108
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:59,903
- Ah, A.D.,
Announcing Department.

109
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:01,538
- Assistant Director.
- Oh, that's even better.

110
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,574
- Hey, hi, Cassie, who's this?

111
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:05,776
- Well, this is Peralta
and Diaz, from the NYPD.

112
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:07,644
They're here about the laptop.
- Oh.

113
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:09,913
I didn't think you were gonna
involve the cops in this,

114
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:12,015
but well, that's okay,
here they are.

115
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:14,718
I'm Gary Lurmax.
I'm the Executive Producer.

116
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,620
- Your name comes up at the end
of every episode

117
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:18,989
with that parrot that says:
"Talk to my lawyer!"

118
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:21,858
- Well, that's actually Walter,
my pet African grey.

119
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:23,927
- Ah, so cool.
Anyways, we're real cops.

120
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,596
Should we look
at the crime scene?

121
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:27,964
- Captain, can we talk?

122
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:30,801
- Boyle, you know my feelings
about bathroom conversations.

123
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:32,636
Steadfastly against.

124
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,738
- I know; I just don't want
Veronica to overhear.

125
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:35,939
I know what she's going through.

126
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,741
I've been broken up with
six times.

127
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:38,875
- Really? Only six?

128
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:40,677
- Yep. Oh wait.

129
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,245
Does it count
if they end the relationship

130
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:43,647
but still want to be friends?

131
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,616
- Yes.
- Oh, then 210.

132
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:46,483
My point is, I'm worried

133
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:48,785
that Veronica
will never forgive Terry.

134
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:50,954
Is there anyone above her
that you can appeal to?

135
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:52,923
- She reports
to Deputy Commissioner Grayson.

136
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,558
I've already tried
to set up a meeting with him.

137
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:56,693
He's on vacation
with his family in the Poconos.

138
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:59,062
- Okay, so maybe we find out
where he's staying

139
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:01,965
and just happen to run into him
and accidental strike up

140
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:03,767
a little convo
about the Nine-Nine.

141
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,768
- That seems rather underhanded.

142
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,503
- Desperate times call for
Desperate Housewives.

143
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:07,804
- What?
- Measures. I said measures.

144
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:09,740
Frankly, sir,
I know it's not protocol,

145
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:11,675
but we don't have
any other option.

146
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,545
- Yes. Good point.
It's not protocol.

147
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:15,546
But it just might work.

148
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,914
You know, Boyle,
you're a bad influence on me.

149
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:20,717
- [gasps] I've never been
a bad influence on anyone!

150
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,586
Should I bring
my leather jacket?

151
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:24,821
It's ankle-length and fitted.

152
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:27,591
I won't bring it;
it's too nice.

153
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:29,526
- Well, I always keep my laptop
in this bag,

154
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,827
but this morning, it was gone.

155
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:33,597
- Nine times out of ten, in a
case like this, it's a stalker.

156
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,098
Whoever jimmied the lock didn't
know what they were doing.

157
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:36,066
- I concur.

158
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:40,937
This was a real hack job.
Hi, Mark Devereaux.

159
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:42,839
- He plays Detective
Cole Tracker on the show.

160
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:44,908
- Yeah, he does.
And if I know Cole Tracker,

161
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,777
the next thing
you're going to say is...

162
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,579
[together]
So what's it gonna be:

163
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:50,614
rock, paper, scissors...

164
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:51,815
or gun?

165
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,050
- You watch the show.
I like that.

166
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,753
So get me up to speed.

167
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:58,021
Who's been in here
since the incident?

168
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,623
- What's he doing?
- Ohh.

169
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:01,057
I think he must be one
of those actors who has to

170
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,258
stay in character all the time.

171
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:04,595
I heard Dustin Hoffman did this
on the set of "Tootsie"

172
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:05,862
and everyone hated it.
- On, no.

173
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:07,330
He just thinks he's a detective

174
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:09,666
because he's been playing one
for 15 years.

175
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,802
- I can hear you.
- Ah, look at that time.

176
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:14,971
They need you on set, Cassie.
I'll walk you over.

177
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:18,642
- Ooh, has anyone noticed
this crumb?

178
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:20,777
Might wanna bag that.
Send it to the boys at the lab.

179
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:21,945
Well, what have we here?

180
00:06:21,978 --> 00:06:23,914
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't touch that.

181
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:24,915
- Isn't this the case
the laptop was in?

182
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:27,784
- Yes, but in real life,
when we handle evidence,

183
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:28,852
we gotta wear gloves.

184
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:30,353
- I never wear gloves
on the show.

185
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:32,856
Fans love to see my fingers.

186
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,659
Almost as much as they love
seeing my feet.

187
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:36,727
Google it.

188
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,894
- Nah.
- Nah.

189
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:39,996
Check it out.
Devereaux gave me his card

190
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,132
and said, "Call me if you can
think of anything else."

191
00:06:42,165 --> 00:06:43,667
Just like on the show!

192
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,135
- Does he know
we're the real cops?

193
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:47,804
- I don't think so.
- Hey, guys.

194
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:50,607
You know, you two have
a really compelling dynamic.

195
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,909
Would you ever consider being
Consulting Producers

196
00:06:52,943 --> 00:06:54,010
for the show?
- Absolutely!

197
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:56,112
What does that mean?
- Well, we pay you to come in

198
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:57,914
in your off hours,
talk to the writers,

199
00:06:57,948 --> 00:06:59,082
tell them your stories,

200
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,751
lend the show
a little authenticity.

201
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:02,352
- Wow, I can't believe I've been
talking to people for free

202
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:03,687
all these years like an idiot!

203
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,955
- Great.
I'll run it by the studio.

204
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:06,957
- He's gonna run it
by the studio, Rosa.

205
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,859
I told you, if we're good cops,
you do your job,

206
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:09,960
things will work out
and they do.

207
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:11,695
- I don't know, man.
Something's weird.

208
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:13,830
I think the job offer is bogus.
He's trying to buy us off.

209
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:15,932
- Look, I don't know about you,
but I can't be bought off.

210
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:18,134
And it's gonna take a hell of
a lot more than some job offer

211
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:20,370
to make me compromise
the integrity of the badge.

212
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:22,773
- Hey, Jake, catering send over
some chicken fingers.

213
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:23,840
- Oh!

214
00:07:26,877 --> 00:07:28,111
- What is wrong with you?

215
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:30,080
We're working a case we'll
definitely gonna solve,

216
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:31,281
we're hanging out
with cool people,

217
00:07:31,314 --> 00:07:33,183
Don't ruin this with
all your Rosa-ness.

218
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:34,217
- Think about it.

219
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,418
That producer guy
didn't want us here at all.

220
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,688
And then after watching us work
for, like, two seconds,

221
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:39,990
he offers us a job?
It doesn't make sense.

222
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:42,325
- That's just how
show biz works, you rube!

223
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:43,894
- Listen to yourself.

224
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:44,961
You're letting all of this
cloud your judgment.

225
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,262
- I love clouds; they keep
the sun away on hot days.

226
00:07:46,296 --> 00:07:47,864
- He doesn't want us
to solve this crime,

227
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:49,900
so he's buying us off.
It's shady.

228
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,868
- I love the shade; it keeps
the sun away on hot days.

229
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:53,069
Besides, he's a rich guy—

230
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:54,337
what's his motive
for stealing a laptop?

231
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,407
- Leverage. He and Cassie have
been fighting over her contract.

232
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,342
It's been all over the news.
- The trades.

233
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,011
They call them
"the trades" here.

234
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:03,914
We read those in our trailers
after we wrap

235
00:08:03,947 --> 00:08:05,882
and before we go home.

236
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,084
Fun fact: stars use the word
"home" too.

237
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:10,220
They're just like us.
- That job offer wasn't real.

238
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:13,323
None of this is real.
- Yes, it is!

239
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:14,424
All right?

240
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:18,194
I know Hollywood
and I know what's real!

241
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:21,031
For example, this door is fake.
Not a real door.

242
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:23,066
It's a "doorn't."
As in "doorn't open this."

243
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,235
And doorn't ruin
my dreams!

244
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,169
- Okay, Sarge, we just want

245
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:28,438
to walk through your breakup
step by step.

246
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:30,306
That doesn't mean we think
you did anything wrong.

247
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,043
[hand thuds]
- Start talking, butthead!

248
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:36,346
- I didn't do anything!
I respect women. I'm a feminist.

249
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:38,348
I believe women should be
on all the money.

250
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:41,351
I wanna pay for a sandwich
with a $10 Ellen DeGeneres.

251
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:44,187
- Maybe you hurt Veronica's
feelings without meaning to?

252
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,356
- Nope.
I planned the perfect breakup.

253
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:48,992
We got dinner
at a mid-range restaurant—

254
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,293
nice enough to show I care,

255
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:52,996
but not so nice she thought
a proposal was coming.

256
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:55,065
I even got her
a classy breakup present,

257
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:57,467
plus a gift receipt, in case
she wanted to exchange it.

258
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,270
And I said just the right words.

259
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:02,072
You deserve the world.

260
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:04,174
You deserve someone
that can make you happy

261
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,943
and it is the greatest
displeasure of my life

262
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:09,045
that I cannot be that man.

263
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,947
- Thank you, Terrence.

264
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,149
[cheers and applause]

265
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:16,019
- I'm not saying you're lying,
Mr. Jeffers,

266
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,954
but if that's how things
went down,

267
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:20,957
why is Veronica so angry,
you stupid liar?

268
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,425
- I don't know!
- You don't know.

269
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,094
Well, we could stay here
all night

270
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,495
until your story starts
making sense.

271
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:27,097
- I want to
figure this out, too,

272
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,098
but I have to go home
eventually.

273
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:31,167
- You think anyone cares
about your damned plans?

274
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,303
I know I don't.
Do you care, Amy?

275
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:35,538
- No, I don't.

276
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:38,441
- Okay, so remember, this is
Deputy Commissioner Grayson

277
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:40,176
and his smoking hot wife.

278
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,377
You'll recognize her
because she looks

279
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:43,113
like an older Patti LuPone.

280
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:45,015
- And you're sure this is
the floor they're staying on?

281
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:48,018
- Yes, I called his secretary
and pretended to be his mother.

282
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:51,421
Or, should I say,
"The Lady Grayson."

283
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:53,023
- Very sly.
- It's a little trick

284
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:55,158
I picked up from
the original bad boy...

285
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:56,526
[door opens]
a Mr. Bugs Bunny.

286
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,029
- Commissioner Grayson,
is that you?

287
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:00,797
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

288
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,265
- Raymond Holt.
Captain of the Nine-Nine.

289
00:10:02,298 --> 00:10:05,235
What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm on vacation. You?

290
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:06,302
- Vacation.
- Vacation.

291
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:07,437
- Vacation.
- Vacation.

292
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,207
- While we're on
the subject of things...

293
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:12,408
are you by any chance
in charge

294
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:13,844
of the Brooklyn precinct
contraction?

295
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:15,245
- I don't want
to talk about that.

296
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:17,447
If you have an issue,
bring it up with your auditor.

297
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,283
- Well our auditor is actually—
- Listen, fellas.

298
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:24,154
If you think you're helping your
precinct's cause, you're not.

299
00:10:24,187 --> 00:10:26,322
- Hey, sexy.
You ready to go?

300
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:29,826
- Oh, that's my goddaughter.

301
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,261
- What?

302
00:10:31,294 --> 00:10:33,163
- So Grayson's a philanderer.

303
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:34,564
What's that gotta do
with the price of onions?

304
00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:36,867
- I don't know, sir.
This could be an opportunity.

305
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,369
I mean, WWBD, right?

306
00:10:39,402 --> 00:10:40,370
What Would Bugs Do?

307
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,272
- Good question.
What would Bugs do?

308
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:44,274
- Bugs would blackmail Grayson.

309
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:47,177
- Then I, sir, am no Bugs.

310
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,111
I won't break the law.

311
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:50,213
- I'm not saying blackmail him
blackmail him.

312
00:10:50,246 --> 00:10:52,315
We just insinuate
that we know what's going on

313
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:54,384
and let him fill in the blanks.

314
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:58,288
- Oh, so it's like...
he blackmails himself?

315
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:00,056
- Uh-huh, you just go up
to him and say,

316
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,193
"Commissioner Grayson,
how's your... wife?"

317
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:04,427
- Commissioner Grayson,
how's your wife?

318
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,462
- No, that just sounds like you
really wanna know how she is.

319
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:09,499
Insinuate—maybe add a pause
before "wife."

320
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:12,268
- Commissioner Grayson,
how's your...

321
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:16,206
wife?

322
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,340
- Too long.
- Fouled hit.

323
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:19,509
Ugh, this is not my strong suit.
- No, no, sir, sir, sir.

324
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,511
You're doing great.
Just forget the pause.

325
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,546
Use your eyebrows—
like this.

326
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,516
How's your...
"pump, pump, pump" wife.

327
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:28,484
- How's your...
pump, pump, pump wife.

328
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:30,553
- Eh, it was a little bit better
in my head.

329
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:34,357
Try this. How's your...
"pump" wife "pump, pump."

330
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,625
- End on a double pump?

331
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:37,293
That's risky.
He'll see right through me.

332
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:38,428
How about...

333
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:41,631
"Pump, pump"
how's your..."pump"?

334
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:43,566
- You forgot to say wife.
- Ah, good note.

335
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,534
- How 'bout this?

336
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:49,305
How's your..."pump" wife
"pump" Grayson "pump"?

337
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,573
- That's the one.

338
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:53,176
- I really don't think anyone
in the crew would've done it.

339
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:54,410
We're like a family.

340
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:56,646
- Yes, and as someone who's
about to marry into that family,

341
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,648
so to speak, I tend
to agree with you, Sarah.

342
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,383
It seems highly unlikely
anyone from the crew

343
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,285
or producers would be involved.

344
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:04,254
- Hey, Sarah,
what's the status

345
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:06,256
on the toilet seat heater
for my trailer?

346
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:07,657
It's day four of cold
butt cheeks going on over here.

347
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,659
- I'm sorry, but this
is official police business.

348
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:12,662
- Putting the screws to her?
I got this.

349
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:17,267
Sarah. You're a P.A.
What do you make a year?

350
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,634
Two, three hundred
thousand dollars?

351
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:19,702
- 30.

352
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:21,137
- 30 hundred thousand dollars
a year?

353
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:22,939
- 30 thousand.
- Oh. Ooh.

354
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,708
And yet Cassie Sinclair
pulls down millions

355
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:26,642
sitting on her butt

356
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:28,478
while you bust your hump
running her errands.

357
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,146
I bet that makes you angry,

358
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,415
angry enough
to steal her laptop?

359
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:33,549
My gut says yes.

360
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,286
- Okay, that's enough.
- You're right.

361
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:37,087
She's not gonna talk.

362
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,689
Sometimes I wonder
why I do this job.

363
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:42,158
- You don't.

364
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:44,961
Okay, what about the
Executive Producer, Gary Lurmax?

365
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:46,496
Do you know where he was
on the night of the robbery?

366
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:48,698
- He's normally in his office
after wrap.

367
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:51,001
Although, last night he did
ask me to tell him

368
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,302
when Cassie left her trailer.

369
00:12:52,335 --> 00:12:54,470
- Hm, interesting.

370
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:57,240
- Or completely useless.
No way to know for sure.

371
00:12:57,273 --> 00:13:00,310
Sarah, one more question.
Those donuts, are they...

372
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:01,577
- They're all free.
- Okay, great.

373
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,613
- Yeah, I wanted to make sure
Cassie was out of her trailer

374
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,981
because we were running behind,

375
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:06,449
and we needed
to make our day.

376
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:08,318
- Is that normally
an Executive Producer's job?

377
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:09,619
- Well, I'm trying
to be more hands on—

378
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:12,022
network pressure, overages.
- Overages, sure.

379
00:13:12,055 --> 00:13:13,456
I get those on my cell phone.

380
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,458
- You know, it's been great
watching you work.

381
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:16,759
Could I introduce you
to the writers?

382
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,694
It'd just take
a couple of minutes, tops.

383
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:20,596
They're very awkward.

384
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,298
They can't talk
much longer than that.

385
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:23,533
- Lead the way, hombre.

386
00:13:23,566 --> 00:13:24,534
Hey, if you name
a character after me,

387
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:27,337
that could be his catch phrase.
- I love that.

388
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,405
- Thank you, Gare Bear.
- I'll go grab 'em.

389
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:32,342
- Great.
- Hey, man.

390
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,544
Focus up.
We have a case to work.

391
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,711
- That's why we gotta
meet the writers.

392
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:36,746
I mean, one of them
probably did it.

393
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,214
You heard Gary—
they're awkward.

394
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:39,349
They're probably
all perverts.

395
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:40,350
- Jake, wake up.

396
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,418
You're being manipulated
by our prime suspect.

397
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:44,487
- He's not our prime suspect,
all right?

398
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,557
He's subprime at best.
[laughs]

399
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,459
Subprime mortgage crisis
reference.

400
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:50,760
[clears throat]
The point is,

401
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,495
you just have to
think the worst of everyone

402
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:54,064
because that's how you see life.
It's sad.

403
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:55,765
- You're sad
and you're being a bad cop.

404
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:57,567
- All right, I know you're just
trying to hurt my feelings,

405
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,502
but I'm in such a good mood
about all of this

406
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:00,770
that there's literally
nothing you can say

407
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:01,837
that'll bring me down.

408
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:04,340
- "Lead the way, hombre"
is a terrible catchphrase.

409
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:06,809
- [scoffs]

410
00:14:06,842 --> 00:14:09,079
Nice try trying to hurt
my feelings 'cause you didn't.

411
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:17,320
- Looks like they left
housekeeping one hell of a tip.

412
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:19,822
A finger tip.

413
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:22,325
And that's how I would lift up
a bloody finger with my pen.

414
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:24,060
- That is great.

415
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:26,096
Oh, in this episode,
the perp is a cannibal.

416
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:27,630
Should I aim
away from his stomach

417
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:28,831
so I don't taint the evidence?

418
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:29,765
- Yeah, that's definitely

419
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,135
how I take down a cannibal
when I do it.

420
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:33,736
- Right.
[indistinct chatter]

421
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,570
- What are you doing?

422
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:36,206
- Talking to Cassie
and the writers,

423
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,807
who, b-t-dubs,
all have alibis.

424
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,343
Also, Gary said that the studio
approved us as producers.

425
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:42,812
I'm having my agent
look over the paperwork.

426
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,347
Okay, fine,
I don't have an agent.

427
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,848
I'm using
my parents' divorce attorney.

428
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:47,350
He's my uncle.
He was disbarred.

429
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:49,319
- Well, while you were
off in fantasy land,

430
00:14:49,352 --> 00:14:51,187
I solved the case.

431
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:54,390
- Wait a minute, Rosa!

432
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:56,192
- Security camera
across from Cassie's trailer

433
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:59,129
caught this yesterday.
- Gare Bear took the laptop?

434
00:14:59,162 --> 00:15:02,232
Come on. No one could've
seen this coming.

435
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:05,335
Except for you.
You saw it coming, obviously.

436
00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:08,638
- Hey there, bud.

437
00:15:08,671 --> 00:15:11,107
We've been going for a while—
you feeling hungry?

438
00:15:11,141 --> 00:15:13,876
- Starving, thanks.
Oh, come on!

439
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,246
- You get a yogurt
when I get the truth.

440
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,880
- Oh God, it's in the grout.

441
00:15:17,913 --> 00:15:19,382
It's gonna smell in here
forever.

442
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:21,484
- I told you,
I did everything right.

443
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:24,354
I even gave Veronica plenty
of time after her mom's death.

444
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,788
- Wait, what does that mean?

445
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:28,391
- I was gonna break up with her,
but then her mom passed,

446
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:31,261
so, like a gentleman,
I waited.

447
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:32,462
That way she wouldn't
have to deal with

448
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:33,896
too much pain all at once.

449
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,665
- How long did you wait,
Jeffords?

450
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:37,367
- I don't know, a year,
year and a half.

451
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,468
- Sarge!
- Seriously?

452
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,803
- What?
I was being considerate.

453
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:43,739
Believe me, she had her fun
for those 18 months.

454
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:45,208
Terry puts out.
- All right.

455
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:48,211
- Also, there's no way
she even knows I waited.

456
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:49,679
- The gift you bought her,
did you buy it

457
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:51,314
when you first wanted
to break up with her

458
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:52,682
or when you finally did it?

459
00:15:52,715 --> 00:15:56,219
- The first time!
But why would that matter—

460
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,155
the gift receipt.

461
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,790
- They all break eventually.

462
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:03,326
Get him out of my sight.

463
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:07,430
- Ah, Commissioner Grayson.

464
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:10,800
- Captain Holt, I told you,
I'm not going to get involved.

465
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,235
- I know.

466
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:14,304
I just wanted to say...
to you...

467
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:17,307
- What's wrong with your face?
Do I need to call a doctor?

468
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,242
- No, I'm clearly trying
to communicate...

469
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,711
- Captain! There you are.

470
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:24,447
We have an... emergency.
- I'm taking care of it.

471
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,948
- Okay, I don't know
what this is.

472
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:28,351
But I'm going to leave.

473
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:30,453
- [sighs]
Why did you stop me?

474
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:32,188
I was making progress.
- I know, sir.

475
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,856
But I have to say something.

476
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:36,859
I love the Nine-Nine.
And the main reason why is you.

477
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:37,960
- Not Jake.

478
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,028
- Yes, clearly,
it's mostly Jake.

479
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:42,232
But it's also you
and the standard that you've set

480
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:44,367
for us with
your unwavering morals.

481
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,868
I'd rather we split up

482
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:49,405
than stay together
and compromise who we are.

483
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:52,208
- Well, thank you, Boyle.
You're right.

484
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:54,377
No matter what happens,
we'll feel better knowing

485
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,346
we didn't resort to blackmail.

486
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:58,348
- I agree.
From now on,

487
00:16:58,381 --> 00:17:02,252
the only black male I want
anything to do with is you.

488
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,321
- That was incredibly
inappropriate.

489
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:06,422
- I know, but
I had thought of it

490
00:17:06,456 --> 00:17:08,424
and I was so proud,
I just had to say it out loud.

491
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,859
- Let's just go.
- Great.

492
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:12,895
- What's going on?
You can't just come in here.

493
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:14,430
- We have a warrant.
- Boom!

494
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,432
And that's a real one,
not a prop.

495
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:17,900
Or have you forgotten
the difference?

496
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,502
Even when it comes to people?
- What?

497
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:22,372
- "People" is me.
You used me like a prop.

498
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:24,006
I thought it was pretty clear.
Rosa got it.

499
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,242
- Nope.
- Detectives, you don't know

500
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:27,377
what you're talking about.

501
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,978
- Found it.
- Oh, look at that.

502
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:31,981
Security cam caught you
breaking into Cassie's trailer

503
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:33,048
and walking off
with this backpack.

504

You know what, you Hollywood
types make me sick.

- Detective...
- For the record,

506
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:38,254
your show stinks.

507
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,356
I've watched over 200 episode
of it and I've never liked one.

- Happy to.

the look on your face

when I pull out Cassie's compu—
just a bunch of pills.

511

- Cassie has
a painkiller problem.

512
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:51,934
The show tries
to protect her from herself.

513
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:53,836
That's why I was surprised
she called the cops,

514
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:55,505
but thanks for busting in here

515
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:58,941

how much you hate my show.

516

- And scene.

517
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:03,279
That was a great example
of a cop making a mistake.

for my first day of work.

520

- No, you can forget
about the job.

521
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:09,452
- But you're still gonna name
a character after me?

522
00:18:11,487 --> 00:18:13,489
- Well, I think
we figured out her size:

523
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:18,461
34 Double Dead.

524

Peralta saying that perfect pun.

didn't work out.

Do you wanna head back
and do some more interviews?

shut down

repossessed, I'll be all alone

we won't be friends anymore

not be friends.

I thought Mark said

his character never wears gloves
on the show.

that does ring a bell.

- Oh, I'm aware.

you never wore gloves

Cassie's laptop bag.

- A double Tracker.

562
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:37,540
- You wanted us
to see you holding the bag

563
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:38,774

were already on it.

two years,

but there's already talk
of her getting a spin-off.

567

You were gonna post
her personal photos

- Ridiculous.

I've never been more insulted
in my life.

Your theory is outrageous.

And what's more,
it's just a theory.
