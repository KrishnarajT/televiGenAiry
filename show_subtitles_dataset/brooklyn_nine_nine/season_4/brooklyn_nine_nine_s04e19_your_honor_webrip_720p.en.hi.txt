I got nothing.
We got an ETA on facilities?

perfect the way it is.

124
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:10,444
It's so comfortable
and relaxed.

125
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:12,479
I can put my butt or feet
on any surface in there.

126
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,915

which is why we're fixing it.

127
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:17,684
I'm open to any and all
suggestions.

00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:31,465

135
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:32,966
- Why would Iris and Amanda

Open concept,

00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,507
Two great ideas.
Let's keep 'em coming.

140
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,609

144
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:50,484
What's wrong with you?

145
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:53,620
- I blew a huge opportunity
to work a case with Holt's mom.

146
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:55,489
- Oh, yeah,
I didn't need an answer.

147
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,190
"What's wrong"
is a rhetorical question.

148
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,526
Anyway, I don't have time
for your sob story, okay?

149
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,861
I blew a tire
on the way here,

150
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:02,629
so I have to call
a tow truck.

151
00:05:02,663 --> 00:05:04,498
- A tow truck? What?

152
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:05,699
You don't know
how to change a tire?

153
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:07,501
I am so disappointed.

00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,536
That is a life skill
that every woman should have.

155
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,672
- Condescending and untrue.

156
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:13,640
Why would I do something myself

157
00:05:13,674 --> 00:05:15,776
if I could pay
someone else to do it?

158
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:17,644
It's a gig economy, Amy.

159
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:19,780
- Gina, it feels so empowering

160
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:23,450
to use your own hands
to change a tire.

161
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:24,651
- Phone, call me a tow truck.

162
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:25,752
- No, phone, no!

163
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:27,554
Look, Gina, don't call
a tow truck, okay?

164
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,690
I will teach you
how to change a tire.

00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:31,558
You'll be so happy I did.

166
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,528

but on one condition.

00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:35,862
You buy me lunch.

168
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,998
- What?
No, I'm doing you a favor.

169
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:39,132

170
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:40,934

Just let me teach you, please.

00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,002
I need a win today.

172
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:45,038

they broke through this window,

00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,040
rifled through the drawers,
and then noticed...

174
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:48,141
[gasps]

175
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:50,911
this adorbs photo of tiny Holt
with a tiny bow tie

176
00:05:50,944 --> 00:05:52,513
holding a tiny toy.

177
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:53,914
- That was
his first slide rule.

178
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:56,216
He carried it with him
all over preschool.

179
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,485
- And then I learned to do
trigonometric functions

180
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,253
in my head,
like a big boy.

181
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:01,955
Let's continue
with the investigation.

182
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,590
- Copy that.
The alarm company said

183
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,225
the break-in happened
around 7:30.

184
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:06,760
Most people are home
at that time.

185
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,061
Is there anyone who knew
you'd be out?

186
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:10,631
- The people who were
with me at wine club.

187
00:06:10,664 --> 00:06:12,933
Oh my, I just remembered,
Carol Spitzheim's house

188
00:06:12,966 --> 00:06:14,801
was broken into
several months ago,

189
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:15,969
also during wine club.

190
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:16,903
- Interesting.

191
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,605
The odds of that happening
coincidentally

192
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,706
are vanishingly small.

193
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,041
- I would say infinitesimally.

194
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:22,909
- Yes, and I would say
teenily-weenily.

195
00:06:22,943 --> 00:06:23,777
We all know words.

196
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,846
So sounds like we should
go undercover

197
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,714
to the next wine club meeting
and scope it out.

198
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:28,715
You think you can get us in?

199
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:29,816
- I think I can arrange that.

200
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,851
There's one tonight.

201
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:31,952
- Great.
Final question.

202
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:33,854
Is this little Raymond's
macaroni art?

203
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:35,889
- No, that's
a macaroni infographic

204
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:37,724
he made about
educational spending

205
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:39,059
during the Johnson
administration.

206
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:41,895
- Oh, of course it is.
I love it.

207
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:43,296
- Detective Peralta,
can I speak to you

208
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,598
in my childhood bedroom?

209
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:45,732
- Oh, my God, yes.

210
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:47,968
Wait,
this isn't your bedroom.

211
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:49,603
- No, it's a regular room.

212
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:51,071
- You tricked me.
- That's right.

213
00:06:51,104 --> 00:06:53,540
My childhood bedroom
is for good detectives

214
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:54,875
who aren't embarrassing
themselves.

215
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,009
- It is?
- I know you're having fun,

216
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,078
but enough is enough with
the prying personal questions.

217
00:06:58,111 --> 00:06:59,646
You're annoying my mother.

218
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,815
- Are you blind?
We're vibing like crazy.

219
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:03,684
- I assure you,
my mother's not a vibrator.

220
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:04,685
- Definitely not
what that's short for.

221
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:07,588
- I know her very well,
and she would never, uh,

222
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:10,323
connect with someone
such as yourself, no offense.

223
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:11,224
- Rude.
- I'm sorry.

224
00:07:11,257 --> 00:07:13,860
What I mean is she and I
are very similar.

225
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:15,662
- Hurtful.
- All I'm saying is

226
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,564
she's not interested
in skateboards

227
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:18,732
and soft-water drinks.

228
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:19,666
- I happen to think
you're wrong.

229
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,301
I think she and I
make a wonderful pair,

230
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:22,703
and we're already
becoming friends.

231
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:23,970
- Now that is humor.

232
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:25,806
- Is everything all right?

233
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,941
- Yes, we're all done in here,
Your Honor.

234
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:28,942
- "Your Honor"?

235
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,343
Don't be so formal.

236
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:31,645
Call me Laverne.

237
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,614
- Oh.
Okay, Laverne.

238
00:07:33,647 --> 00:07:35,348
You got it, Laverne.

239
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:36,950
Laverne.

240
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:40,186
- Well, I know we're
undercover, but I gotta say

241
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,322
I'm dying to get
a little tipsy at wine club

242
00:07:42,355 --> 00:07:45,091
and just dish
with my new BFF Laverne.

243
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,793
- Hmm, it's cute
you think that.

244
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:47,928
My mother doesn't dish.

245
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:49,062
It's one of her
better qualities.

246
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:51,932
And you know who else
she told to call her Laverne?

247
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:54,801
The mailman.
The substitute mailman.

248
00:07:54,835 --> 00:07:56,002
- Hello.
I'm Judge Holt.

249
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,237
- It's nice to meet you.

250
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,072
I'm Tyrone Beverton,

251
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,874
a Bordeaux enthusiast
who sometimes dabbles

252
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:02,609
in the Burgundies,
if forced.

253
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:05,245
- And I'm Tank Hendricks.
Moms love me.

254
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:08,281
- Oh, strange detail.
But believable.

255
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:12,619
Oh, Daniella, these are
two prospective members,

256
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:13,887
Tyrone and Tank.

257
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,355
Tyrone likes Bordeauxs,

258
00:08:15,388 --> 00:08:17,858
and Tank is beloved by mothers.
- Yes.

259
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,093
- Great. Could I get your info
for our database?

260
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,129
- Absolutely.
I live at 100 Charming Avenue.

261
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:25,999
And Tyrone here
is at 3282nd Street,

262
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:28,101
right next to
Ya Burnt Pizza.

263
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,903
- Great.
Enjoy your tasting.

264
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:31,838
- Thanks.

265
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:34,207
- 100 Charming Avenue?
- It's a real place.

266
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,209
I looked it up,
specifically to make you mad.

267
00:08:36,242 --> 00:08:38,178
Okay, I'm gonna go find
and catch our perp.

268
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:39,880
Love you, bye.

269
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:40,881
- [sighs]

270
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:43,984
- And that is that.

271
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,986
- We have Shui'd the Feng
out of this place.

272
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:46,987
- It's beautiful.

273
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,889
Are we better at this
than our regular jobs?

274
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,090
- Unquestionably.

275
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,992
We should start our own
home renovation show.

276
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:53,059
- I can see the poster.

277
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:54,995
I'm on Terry's shoulders
screwing in a light bulb,

278
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:57,130
and Rosa stands by a ladder
looking up at us like,

279
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,232
"Oh, boy, what did I
get myself into?"

280
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:01,702
- I love that idea.
- Sign me up.

281
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:02,869
[laughter]

282
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,905
- Shame.
- Shame, shame.

283
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:06,372
- What is happening?

284
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:08,975
- You guys messed up.
You messed up big time!

285
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,143
- And worst of all,
you're standing here

286
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,344
applauding yourselves for it.

287
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,079
Shame.
- Are you blind?

288
00:09:13,113 --> 00:09:14,981
This place looks amazing.

289
00:09:15,015 --> 00:09:16,182
It looks like
a Swedish airport.

290
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:17,383
Everyone's gonna love it.

291
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:18,985
- Just keep telling
yourselves that.

292
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,054
Shame.
- Shame.

293
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:23,389
- Well, everyone
I talked to checked out.

294
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:24,691
Any luck on your end?
- None.

295
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:27,293
Unfortunately we're surrounded
by stupid law-abiding citizens.

296
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:28,695
- Check out this guy
at the bar.

297
00:09:28,729 --> 00:09:30,296
He's furtively looking
at my mother.

298
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,233
- Well, let's see
what he has to say for himself.

299
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,468
Hi, there.
I'm Tank, this is Tyrone.

300
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,370
He's the son
of a close friend of mine.

301
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,172
- Anyway, we're new members.

302
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,974
- George Kenderson.

303
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,976
I'm fairly new
to the club as well.

304
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,045
- How'd you hear about it?

305
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,013
- I, um...

306
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:48,081
I didn't.

307
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:49,249
- You didn't hear about it?

308
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:50,917
That seems rather odd.

309
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:53,253
- Does it?
- Mm-hmm.

310
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:55,355
- I'm sorry,
I gotta leave now.

311
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:58,158
I've got some work to do.
Good-bye.

312
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,259
- When it comes to George,

313
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:02,495
I'm getting hints of guilty
with undertones of lying.

314
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:06,132
- Oh, yeah, and a strong bouquet
of "up to no good."

315
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,435
- [chuckles]
Wine terms.

316
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:12,038
- And then you release the jack.

317
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:13,473
And voila.

318
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:15,375
Tire changed.

319
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,110
Don't you feel empowered?

320
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:19,112
- Yes, there's nothing
more empowering

321
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,981
than getting
a condescending colleague

322
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,482
to do a menial task for you.

323
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:23,483
- What are you talking about?

324
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:25,218
- I'm talking about
how you just changed my tire

325
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,187
while I sat here watching
a 20-minute video

326
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,055
of a monkey
getting its hair combed.

327
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:30,991
- But you were paying attention.

328
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:32,759
You laughed at my joke.
- Did I?

329
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:35,796
- I like to call this
the jack of all trades.

330
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,397
- Silly monkey!

331
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,232
Oh, this monkey.

332
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,500
- So you really didn't
learn anything?

333
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:42,368
- No, but I hope you did.

334
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:43,469
Can't school Gina.

335
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:46,172
Gina schools you.
Class dismissed.

336
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:49,409
- Hello, Laverne.

337
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,144
We're not undercover anymore,

338
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:52,512
so I'm no longer
your acquaintance Tank.

339
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:54,447
I'm back to being your
close personal friend Jake.

340
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,116
- Okay.
- We have a lead.

341
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:57,350
George Kenderson.

342
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:59,119
We ran his name
through the system.

343
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:01,321
He got a parking ticket outside
your apartment last week.

344
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,156
We think he was
casing your place.

345
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:05,025
- Oh, my.
That is shocking.

346
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:06,359
I am shocked right now.

347
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:07,460
- And I am enraged.

348
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:09,529
We are shocked and enraged.

349
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:11,264
- Yes, and we're
all showing it.

350
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:12,799
- I'll get the car.
Stay with my mother.

351
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,035
I've never seen her
this shocked before.

352
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,140
- Jake, I need to tell you
something in confidence.

353
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:22,408
- [gasps] It's happening.
It's dish time. Okay.

354
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,377
- George Kenderson
did not rob me.

355
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,312
He was not casing
my apartment.

356
00:11:26,346 --> 00:11:28,581
- How do you know?
- He was with me that night.

357
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,117
- Doing what?
Oh, doing you.

358
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:32,285
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

359
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:34,387
I mean, way to go.
I'm sex positive.

360
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,521
I don't know what to say.

361
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:38,324
- George and I have been
in a relationship for two years.

362
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:41,161
Raymond doesn't know.
Please don't tell him.

363
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:43,563
I'm asking you as a friend.

364
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:46,399
- As a friend.

365
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,068
Copy that.

366
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,469
- Buckle up.

367
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:51,537
That car belongs
to our lead suspect,

368
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:52,605
George Kenderson.

369
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:53,874
- Lead suspect?

370
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:55,575
Is that how we left it?

371
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:57,510
I remember saying,
it can't be Kenderson.

372
00:11:57,543 --> 00:11:59,345
Remember, we made up
that little song.

Kenderson is not the one ♪

back to the draw— ♪

375
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,319
- Oh, Kenderson is on the move.
- Oh, great.

376
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:07,520
- There's something so devious

377
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:09,322
about taking advantage
of wine lovers.

378
00:12:09,355 --> 00:12:11,858
But there won't be any wine
where you're headed, George.

379
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:14,227
Unless you make it
in a toilet.

380
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,529
Toilet wine.
Let's bring him in, Peralta.

00:12:17,563 --> 00:12:19,199
- Well, wait. Not yet.
- Why?

383
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,600

00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,936
Mm.
- What are you doing?

386
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:26,339
Forensics says his prints were
all over my mothers' apartment.

387
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:27,340
- Eh.

00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:32,478
Nope, nope, nope.

390
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:34,447
- Enough!
He robbed my mother.

391
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,449
- No, he didn't.

392
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:38,084
He's her lover.

393
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:40,153
He's your mother lover.
He's lovering your mother.

394
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:42,122
- What?
That's not true.

395
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:43,323
- Yes, it is.

396
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:45,225
- I would know if she
were seeing someone.

397
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:46,559
- She told me last night.

398
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:48,929
They've been together
for two years.

399
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:49,963
- I see.

400
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:53,333
- And she asked me
not to say anything to you.

401
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,436
- I see.

402
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:59,539
- So are you upset
or just processing

403
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,507
or just stopping
in the middle of nowhere

404
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,409
and getting out of the car?
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

Stop honking!
He's going through something!

- Hello, sir.
How was your walk?

408
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,186
- Long and brisk.
- Wonderful.

409
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:14,921
You left me in the car,
took the keys with you.

410
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:16,089
It's still there.
Doesn't matter.

411
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:17,190
Look, I know it
must have been upsetting

412
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:20,360
to find out about
your mom's, mm,

No.
Doinking.

416
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,698
Ah, it's too similar
to boinking.

417
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:27,367
I'm looking for the words.

418
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,504

Eh, let's just go with

- Yes, I was caught off guard,
but I'm fine now.

421
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:38,044
- Really?
- Yes.

422
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,479
And don't worry,
I understand.

423
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:41,514
She didn't want me to know,
and I will behave

424
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,649
in a completely
professional manner.

425
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:46,652
- Great.
'Cause she's in your office.

- Oh, wonderful.
Let's go talk about the case.

427
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:50,523
- Wow, you are
taking this so well.

428
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:51,591
- Laverne Kinnebrew Holt,

429
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:53,526
you're under arrest
for obstruction of justice.

430
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,327
both: What?

431
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,529
- I know you're sleeping
with George.

432
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:57,397
- Oh, come on, man.

433
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,532
- Raymond, I can tell
that you're upset.

434
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:01,968
- I am because you withheld
information from this detective

435
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:04,070
about an ongoing
police investigation.

436
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,739
- All right, I don't think this
is actually about police stuff.

437
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:08,641
Maybe we should all
just take a deep breath

438
00:14:08,674 --> 00:14:11,177
and consider
not arresting our moms.

439
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:13,579
- Fine.
You're unarrested, mother.

440
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:14,747
And Detective Peralta,

441
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,682
since you two
are such good friends,

442
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:19,085
why don't you handle
the case on your own?

443
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,054
Good day.

444
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,222
- Captain.

445
00:14:22,255 --> 00:14:24,557
- Hey.
What is going on in the kitchen?

446
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,992
It's insanely packed.

447
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:27,460
- They're all
just taking a break.

448
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,695
Why is nobody breaking
in the new break room?

449
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:31,764
- 'Cause it's a giant turd.
- It's the worst.

450
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:34,434
It's unusable.
You guys don't even like it.

451
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,002
- Yes, we do.
- Really?

452
00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:38,471
You like those new stools,
huh, Charles?

453
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,140
- Oh.

454
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:41,207
Oh.

455
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:42,442
There we go.

456
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:44,077
- And, Rosa,
how was your snack?

457
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,545
- [groans]

00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:48,081
[yelling]

459
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:49,582
- You know what really
chafes my crack?

460
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:51,117
We spent years
crafting that break room

461
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,553
into something special,
something comfortable.

462
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:55,121
- A place with so many stains

463
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,756
that the new ones
just blended in.

464
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:59,192
- Where the couch cushions
were so worn down,

465
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:02,128
they comforted all butts,
large or small,

466
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,629
flat or juicy.

467
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:04,730
- Juicy?
- Gross.

468
00:15:04,764 --> 00:15:05,665
- We built a masterpiece,

469
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,667
and you amateurs
flushed it down the toilet.

Skir-plash.

471
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,470

a flushing sound?

00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,677
- Hello, Gina.
- Ugh!

475
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,246
I knew a truck carrying
Khloe Kardashian jeans

476
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,615
didn't overturn
in the parking garage.

477
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:24,284
- The only thin
that's overturned

478
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:27,620
is your decision to not
learn how to fix a tire.

479
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:29,522
- Why won't you let this go?

480
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,524
- My parents wanted me to learn
how to change a tire,

481
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,226
and I thought
it was a waste of time.

482
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:35,095
Like any other
16-year-old girl,

483
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:37,230
all I wanted to do
was sit in my room alone

484
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:39,165
reading books on U.S. history.

485
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,602
- Ugh, every story about
your childhood makes me so sad.

486
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,537
- Then one day
on the way to math camp...

487
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,272
- Oh, sad.
- Our tire blew out,

488
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:48,141
and my mother
made me fix it.

489
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:49,775
She said I should
never be dependent

490
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,644
on anyone for anything.

491
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:53,546
And neither should you.

492
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,780
So we're not gonna leave here

493
00:15:54,814 --> 00:15:57,083
until you learn
how to fix this.

494
00:15:57,117 --> 00:15:58,151
- Oh!

495
00:15:58,184 --> 00:15:59,185
Oh, damn.

496
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,553
Power play.

497
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,155
And very moving speech.

498
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:03,789
- Thank you.
- One little thing though.

499
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:05,158
That's not my car.

500
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:08,194
That's my car.
Same make, same model,

501
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,363
but you just slashed
a random stranger's tire.

502
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:12,665
Oopsie!

503
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:14,200
- Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

504
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,202
- Ah, hey, Captain.

505
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:17,770
Whoa, look at that map work.

506
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:19,272
Sick as heck.

507
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:21,874
- Oh an attempt at flattery.
Well, it won't work.

508
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:24,144
This was Boyle's map,
and it was adequate at best.

509
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:26,279
- Okay, I called
some precincts,

510
00:16:26,312 --> 00:16:28,114
and it turns out that
while we were at wine club,

511
00:16:28,148 --> 00:16:29,682
there was
an attempted break-in

512
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:31,851
at 100 Charming Avenue.

513
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:33,819
- Oh, yes, the address
you used at the wine club

514
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:35,221
specifically to make me mad.

515
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,156
- Well, I wouldn't
put it that way.

516
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,158
- You put it that way
last night, verbatim.

517
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:40,126
- And I totally regret that now,
and I hope that we can move on,

518
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,694
but the point is
the only person

519
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,829
who heard me use
that address was...

520
00:16:43,863 --> 00:16:45,731

The mailing list lady
from the wine club.

522
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,269
She would give the addresses
to her husband, Tommy—

523
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:51,371
Hi, Tommy—and he would
break into the houses

524
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:54,240
while the occupants
were out sipping vino.

525
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,309
- Okay, case closed.

526
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:57,777
- Great. So you want
to call your mother?

527
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,245
Tell her we solved it?
- No need.

528
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,282
You can tell Laverne
the whole story over brunch.

529
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:04,150

530
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:07,687
- All right, sir, I'm sorry
that I got in the middle

531
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,322
of your family business,
but I'm afraid

532
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:11,324
I have to get
in the middle of it again.

533
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:13,159
Look, I don't talk
about this a lot,

534
00:17:13,193 --> 00:17:14,527
but I actually have had
a difficult relationship

535
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,628
with one of my parents.

536
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:17,530
- Yes, your father.
You talk about it obsessively.

537
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:19,332
- Well, I wouldn't say
obsessively.

538
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:20,500
I mean, sure,
there are times

539
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,701
where I wish he was
there for me more but—

540
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,269
- Peralta.
- Right. Sorry, you.

541
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:24,904
Look, in my experience
the best thing to do

542
00:17:24,937 --> 00:17:26,939
in these types of situations
is just talk about it.

543
00:17:26,972 --> 00:17:29,642
- That's not the relationship
my mother and I have.

544
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,444
We're not open like that.

545
00:17:31,477 --> 00:17:32,445
- Really?
Because you're open with me.

546
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:35,248
- Only because you ask me
annoying, intrusive,

547
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:36,549
personal questions
all the time.

548
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:38,384

You need to do that.

551
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:43,356
- Oh, yes,
that would be awesome.

552
00:17:43,389 --> 00:17:44,490
- Well, it's not gonna happen.

553
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:47,693
Alas, we are not
cowabunga people.

554

Dismissed.

555
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:52,965
- Once again,
I am so sorry about your tire.

556
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:56,436
Just accidentally
slashed it with my knife.

557
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,404
- How does that happen
accidentally?

558
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:00,373
- It's very common.
I should know, I'm a cop.

559
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:02,375
Anyway, I will pay
for the damage.

560
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:04,544
- Wait, what's happening?
My tire is fine.

561
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:07,213
- It is?
It is!

562
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:08,714
Of course it is.

00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,714
I replaced that plebe's flat
with one of my tires.

578
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,249
- You changed a tire!

579
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:45,418
You were listening to me.
- Not at all.

580
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,420
I watched a video online
on how to do it.

581
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:50,723
But I will give you this,
it was really empowering.

582
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,293

such an impressive job,

583

especially for
your first time.

584
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,662
- Oh, no, I had
a bunch of practice.

585
00:18:56,696 --> 00:18:58,598
I actually used
your car for that.

586
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:00,300
Thank you so much.

00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,001
- Oh.

588
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:04,337
You still changed a tire.

Counting this as a win.

590
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:09,809

about the break room.

- Nuh doy.

592
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,045
- Nobody liked it,
and it wasn't functional.

593
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:14,146
- Double nuh doy.

594
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:16,015

everything back the way it was.

595

We want your seal of approval.

596
00:19:18,618 --> 00:19:20,019
- Oh, we'll be
the judge of that.

597
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,555

we're asking for.

hit it, it turned to dust.
