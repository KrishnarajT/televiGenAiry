00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:50,790
- Ah.
- You know, squat 400

340
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:53,259
On the bench push fitness
and whatnot.

341
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:54,460
What's up?
- I need my laptop.

342
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:56,429
I wanna practice my speech
with the new colors beforehand

343
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,030
So i'm not alarmed
when they pop up.

344
00:11:58,063 --> 00:12:00,433
- Right, right.
Um, i know that terry

345
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:02,001
Definitely did do that work,

346
00:12:02,034 --> 00:12:03,436
So i'll just go grab 'em.
- Okay.

347
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:06,272
- Uh, you wait here.
You can't come in because...

348
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:07,473
Amy's naked

349
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:11,577
And she's embarrassed
of her weird body.

350
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:13,846
Terry.
Terry.

351
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,048
Terry. Terry.
- [groans]

352
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:17,850
Why's my tongue so big?

353
00:12:17,883 --> 00:12:19,285
- Because you're a big person.

354
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,486
Holt is here.
He wants his presentation.

355
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,988
- The presentation!
I didn't do it.

356
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,057
Okay,
i just need to add color.

357
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,825
It'll only take two minutes.

358
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,593
Stall him.
- Okay, no problem.

359
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,462
I'm definitely got two minutes
worth of stall material.

360
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:32,064
Okay, sarge will be right out.

361
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:35,000
In the mean time,
why don't you and i just chat,

362
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:38,371
You know,
for a couple minutes about...

363
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:40,906
Brumpst.

364
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,342
- Brumpst?

365
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,977
- Hold on.

366
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,312
I couldn't stall him,
he's too good,

367
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:47,079
It's not my fault.

368
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:48,414
Where are you
on the presentation?

369
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:49,549
- Jake, holt's laptop
isn't here.

370
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:50,850
It's gone.

371
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:55,788
- Where are you on my graphs?
The presentation is

372
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,690
In 90 minutes.
- I'm definitely all done,

373
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:00,092
But i'm worried, if you're going
up against jeffrey,

374
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,694
Will color be enough?

375
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,096
I was thinking,
slide transitions.

376
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:05,765
- Oh, good grief.

377
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:07,700
Very well.
You may add cross dissolves.

378
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:10,670
But so help me god, jeffords,
if i see even one star wipe—

379
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,838
- I just need a half an hour.
- Perhaps i should supervise.

380
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:14,707
- No, you should
clear your head.

381
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,709
Work out.
Rosa was just headed to the gym.

382
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:19,412
She'll keep you there.
Be right back.

383
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:20,846
Rosa, i need you
to workout with holt

384
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,114
For the next half hour.
Cool?

385
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:24,417
- [groans]
- Great.

386
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,486
I'll get your sneakers.

387
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,721
- This is invigorating,
isn't it?

388
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:31,857
- [groans]

389
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:34,594
- I can't believe you lost
the captain's laptop.

390
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,128
You were kind of
out of control last night.

391
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:37,663
- I was not.

392
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:39,799
Although, pretty sure
my ribs are broken,

393
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,834
And i think i'm wearing
a pillowcase i cut holes in

394
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:44,404
As a shirt.
- We have to think.

395
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:46,439
Does anyone remember having
the laptop?

396
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:48,941
- Wait, we all left the room
and went somewhere

397
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:50,943
And i didn't want
to leave the computer behind

398
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:53,379
With so many strangers,
so i took it!

399
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:54,447
- Yes, charles, you're a genius.

400
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,617
All right, we gotta split up
and search the hotel.

401
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,786
Wait a minute.
Why is my shoe all wet?

402
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,887
The pool!

403
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,490
- Damn it.
No sign of the laptop.

404
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:05,891
What were we doing here?

405
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:08,628
- Look, there's jake's shirt.
It looks burnt.

406
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:10,830
- Because i was on fire.
Hence the pillow shirt.

407
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:11,897
It's all coming back to me.

408
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:14,934
I'm a human torch!

409
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:17,537
Nope, it was just
that one memory.

410
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,704
This was a dead end.
- [sighs]

411
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:19,872
- I remember
why you were on fire.

412
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,474
The state troopers
brought fireworks.

413
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:22,775
- Yes.
We're unraveling the mystery.

414
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,610
It's like we're detectives.
- We are detectives.

415
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,512
- Right.
Another thing we remembered.

416
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,013
This is going great.

417
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:29,715
- Oh, raymond.

418
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,517
Of course you have beaten me
to the gym.

419
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,886
You live life right.
It's amazing.

420
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,721
- Workout your legs, jeffrey.
Not your mouth.

421
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:38,524
- [chuckles]
you are hilarious.

422
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,860
I am so psyched for your
presentation to the board.

423
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,862
I'm sure it's gonna be amazing.
- I'm gonna crush you

424
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:44,730
Like a can
of diet seltzer water.

425
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:48,668
- I don't doubt it.
Well, i'm off to do some squats.

426
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:49,935
- Dumbass.

427
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,236
[playful dramatic music]

428
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,607
- Okay, so this is definitely
where we set off the fireworks,

429
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,908
But still no laptop.

430
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,810
- How did i catch on fire?

431
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:00,813
- Oh, no,
i just remembered something.

432
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:02,682
Terry feels bad.

433
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:05,518
[crash]
what the hell was that?

434
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:07,920
[firework whizzes]
- [grunts]

435
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,689
Ah!

436
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:11,491
- Ah!

437
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:12,958
- Hence the chest pain,

438
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,560
But what was that loud crash?

439
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:15,961
- I think that
might have been me.

440
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:19,499
See you in hell, partner.

441
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:20,700
[crash]

442
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:21,901
- You killed her?

443
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,836
- Her?
Oh, my god, it was a her.

444
00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:25,871
You were replacing amy, not me.

445
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:28,541
What have i done?
- Wait, the robot has a camera.

446
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:30,042
Maybe she saw
who took the laptop.

447
00:15:30,075 --> 00:15:31,977
There's the laptop bag.
- You think you're

448
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:34,079
So much better than me.

449
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:36,582
You're right.
- I'm just gonna fast forward.

450
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:37,983
- Oh, hey, robot.

451
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:40,085
I got something really cool
to show you on the balcony.

452
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,955
I think you're
really gonna like it.

453
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:43,923
Oh, you're heavy.

454
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:46,726
- Fast forward.
- Did you guys see that?

455
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,528
He put the bag down
behind the plant.

456
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,862
- Let's go.

457
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:52,097
Is it there?
Is it there?

458
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:53,933
- It's here!
- We did it!

459
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:56,702
We found the bag!
[all laugh]

460
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:58,771
Oh, wait, hungover.
No spinning.

461
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,072
No spinning.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

462
00:16:00,105 --> 00:16:02,742
- [sighs, exhales]
i'm good.

463
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:03,909
[gags]
- Oh, hey, hey!

464
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,811
- Oh, scully.

465
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:07,012
You bummed about cindy

466
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,114
Or you just feel at home
in a body bag?

467
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:10,883
- We use the same
medicated powder.

468
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,618
I could smell it.

469
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:15,120
She's my soul mate, amy.
- So she doesn't like you.

470
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,590
It happens.
I mean, not to me,

471
00:16:17,623 --> 00:16:20,025
But not everyone has
my combination

472
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:23,095
Of elegance and charm
and grace and poise,

473
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,898
And then just gif-Ability.
Some would say "jif,"

474
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,767
But then some would
also say "syrup."

475
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,135
- Wait, what if we could
give scully our personalities?

476
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:32,037
- [gasps]
he would love that.

477
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:33,839
- We could talk to him
through an earpiece

478
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,041
And tell him what to say.
- Okay,

479
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:37,810
But can we attach
a string to it?

480
00:16:37,843 --> 00:16:39,912
Last time i wore an earpiece,
it fell in.

481
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,814
- How you doing, scully?
- Nervous.

482
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,983
I can feel my legs.
That never happens.

483
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:45,918
Something's wrong.
- Okay, just go up to her

484
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:46,852
And repeat what we say.

485
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:48,954
- [quietly] i wasn't gonna—
- Hi, there.

486
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:50,089
- Scully, hey.

487
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,958
Both: cindy, there's something
i want to say to you.

488
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:54,727
- The moment i first saw you...

489
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,928
- You took my breath away.

490
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:57,763
Both: whenever i'm around you...

491
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,064
- My heart beats faster.

492
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,299
I know you're
going home today...

493
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:02,768
Both: but i couldn't let you
leave without asking you out.

494
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:03,936
- Cindy shatz...
- Cindy shatz...

495
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:06,939
- Can i buy you a drink?
- Can i buy you a drink?

496
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:08,674
[indistinct chatter]

497
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,975
- No, i'm sorry.

498
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,877
I'm not interested.

499
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:14,079
- What?
- No.

500
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:16,716
- Guys, earpiece fell in.

501
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:18,017
- What on earth
took you so long?

502
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,852
- Yeah, where the frigging hell
were you?

503
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,086
- I was trying
to get the colors right,

504
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,287
But in the end,

505
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:24,990
I decided to just go with
your original black and white.

506
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:26,959
- It's probably even
one color too many.

507
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:30,062
Anyways, in you go.
[sighs]

508
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:31,697
Looking good, diaz.

509
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:33,098
- Bite me.
- Okay.

510
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:34,867
- Uh, hello,
i'm captain raymond holt,

511
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,802
And if i have the pleasure
of joining your board,

512
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:38,037
Here are some of the things
that i would do.

513
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,739
- See?
It all worked out.

514
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:42,708
We threw a wild party with
absolutely zero consequences.

515
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,844
[audience murmuring]
- Jake, something's wrong.

516
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,979
- Oh, um...

517
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:49,715
Oh, i don't know how that
got in there or what it is.

518
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:51,984
Um, i'll just, uh—next slide.
[projector clicks]

519
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:54,186
Well, that's strange.
Next slide.

520
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,689
Next.
Next.

521
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,724
Oh, i see what's happening here.

522
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:01,126
Uh, due to an issue
with the internet cloud,

523
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,762
You are seeing
a series of pictures

524
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:04,830
That have nothing to do with me

525
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:06,832
Or the 99th precinct.

526
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:09,068
- I don't get it.
Who even took these pictures?

527
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:10,002
- I did.

528
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,638
You guys should really be
a lot more careful

529
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:14,239
About leaving laptops
lying around.

530
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:15,741
[camera clicks]

531
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,910
For next year.
[chuckles]

532
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,178
- Consequences.

533
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:25,651
- My, oh, my.
Boyle, can you even tell me

534
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:26,786
What is happening
in this picture?

535
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,154
- Uh, that's me doing
a jean-Claude van damme split

536
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:30,656
Between two beds.

537
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,057
I had to wear my underwear
for flexibility.

538
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:34,827
- Mm-Hmm, and, uh, santiago?

539
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,195
- I believe that
is me throwing up

540
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:38,430
Into a pillow case.
- Uh-Oh.

541
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,132
- You have all embarrassed
the precinct.

542
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:42,034
Now when people think
of the nine-Nine,

543
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,435
They'll think of, um...

544
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:46,772
Oh, detective diaz filling
an iron with tequila.

545
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:47,940
- So i could make tequila steam.

546
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:49,942
- I can quite believe
i'm gonna say this,

547
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:53,012
But i'm sorry i even came
to rochester.

548
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,716
[door opens and closes]
- [whimpers]

549
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:57,883
- Hey, it's all right, scully.

550
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,051
We'll find a way
to make it up to him.

551
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:00,853
- Ah, it's not about him, jake.

552
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:04,056
I'm just sad because
i'm an unlovable sack of fungus,

553
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:05,691
And i'm gonna be alone forever.

554
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:07,426
- Oh, um...

555
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:09,461
Hey, there's
probably someone out there for—

556
00:19:09,494 --> 00:19:10,996
- We got this.
- Oh, thank god.

557
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,133
- Wow, pint of milk
on the rocks.

558
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,201
Real scully move.
- Can i help you?

559
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,870
- Hi, we're friends of scully's,

560
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:20,105
And we're not sure
why you rejected him?

561
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,041
- Now, we know
scully's not perfect,

562
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:24,076
His hands smell like clams,
and, yeah,

563
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,879
Over 75% of his body has died,
and—

564
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,447
- Gina, you can stop
listing things.

565
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,750
- Point is,
he's a good guy.

566
00:19:30,783 --> 00:19:31,751
You should give him a chance.

567
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:35,020
- I know, when i first meet him,
i was intrigued,

568
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:37,122
But then mr. Confident
showed up,

569
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:38,423
I'm not interested in that.

570
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:41,060
Confident people
are mean and selfish.

571
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:44,129
- Wait, you liked
awkward scully?

572
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:44,964
Giraffe-Heart scully?

573
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:47,800
- Oh, my god,
he has a giraffe heart?

574
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,202
Aww, i bet it pushes
on his organs.

575
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:52,171
- [laughs awkwardly]

576
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,173
We'll be back in five minutes.
Wait right here.

577
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:56,075
Bartender,
can you top off her milk?

578
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,077
[playful music]

579
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,812
- Hey.
- Hey.

580
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:01,146
- You wanna hear a joke?
- Okay.

581
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,082
- I don't know any jokes.
I should go.

582
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:06,752
- Oh, that's okay.
I don't know any jokes either.

583
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:08,921
- I slept in a body bag
last night.

584
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:11,090
- [exhales]

585
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:15,928
- Whoa.
- They're so cute.

586
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,230
Oh, no, scully, don't put
your finger in her mouth.

587
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:21,266
Oh, she likes it.

588
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:27,072
- Captain, i'm sorry
that things got out of hand,

589
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:29,108
But you can still be
on the board.

590
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:31,276
I read 85 pages
of the convention bylaws,

591
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,145
And—
- That was unnecessary.

592
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:35,147
I don't wanna be on the board.
- But i read bylaws.

593
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,281
- I wanna show you
a picture from last night

594
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:37,883
That really upset me.
- Okay,

595
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,518
But in my defense,
rosa bet me 50 cents

596
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,552
That i couldn't drink
all that shampoo.

597
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:43,088
- That's not what i wanted to—
you drank shampoo?

598
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:44,223
- What?
No.

599
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:46,191
You're the one farting bubbles.

600
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:47,960
- This is what i wanted
to show you.

601
00:20:47,993 --> 00:20:49,228
Do you know
what disappoints me most

602
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:51,496
About this about this picture?
That i'm not in it.

603
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,232
I can't remember the last time

604
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:56,001
I saw the nine-Nine so happy,

605
00:20:56,035 --> 00:20:57,837
And i wasn't there.
- 'cause you were working

606
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,104
On your presentation
to get us a win.

607
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:01,340
- Yeah, well,
it wasn't a real win.

608
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:04,243
I wish i had been in that photo.
- I know,

609
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:07,279
And i'm sorry you didn't
have more fun this weekend.

610
00:21:07,312 --> 00:21:09,281
But it's not over,

611
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:11,350
And we are still in rochester.

612
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:12,818
- What are you saying?

613
00:21:12,852 --> 00:21:14,519
- I think you know
what i'm saying.

614
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:16,221
- What a thermometer.

615
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:19,258
Look at the mercury reservoir
on that mamacita.

616
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,962
Oh, peralta, this is amazing.
I'm floating on air.

617
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:25,097
- Hey, everybody,
get in for a picture.

618
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,966
Excuse me, sir.
Can you take a picture of us?

619
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,133
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

620
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,970
- Everybody say
daniel gabriel fahrenheit.

621
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:33,305
[together]
daniel gabriel fahrenheit.

622
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:37,376
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
