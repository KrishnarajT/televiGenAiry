- Ladies and gentlemen,
we are gathered here today

00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,861
to answer and age-old question.

3
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:07,198
- Right, what's Amy's deal?
She single?

4
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:08,632
- No, we're dating.
Come on.

5
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:09,666
The question is:

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,734
Who here does
the best impression

7
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,369
of Captain Raymond Holt?

8
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:13,570
You'll be judged on voice,

00:00:13,604 --> 00:00:15,706
body language,
and overall lack of flair.

10
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:17,641
Everyone will perform
the same scenario:

00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:19,376
Captain Holt
eating a marshmallow

12
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,677
for the very first time.

Let the Holt-off begin!

14
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:26,650
- What is this glutinous
monstrosity before me?

15
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:28,519
- The sugar in this
is quite sweet.

16
00:00:28,552 --> 00:00:32,523
- Ooh, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm-hmm-hmm!

17
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:33,524
- That's your Holt impression?

18
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:34,591
- I can hear him doing that.

19
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:37,261

Care for one?

And now, on a personal note,

00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:19,736
I have some thoughts
about Beyoncé's "Lemonade"

with a British accent?

- I felt like
doing the Cuban accent

they're huge homophobes

has a certain dignity.

00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,110
Oh, you are an evil ge—"

174
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:56,580
This—this I could
get on board for.

175
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:57,581
- Hmm.
- Only problem is,

176
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:59,583
PI license is like, two grand.

177
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:00,851
- I could lend you the money.

178
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:02,653
Think of it as an investment

179
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:04,120
from someone
who believes in you.

180
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:06,056
- Wow, thanks, Captain.
That means every—

181
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:09,726
Whoa, hang on, you carry
a check book with you?

182
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,595
- 'Course, you never know when
you're gonna need groceries.

183
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:12,963
- So cool.

184
00:06:12,996 --> 00:06:14,097
[beeping]
- Where are you?

185
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,966
- Picking up Amy's dad
at the airport.

186
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:17,934
- Ooh, that's a strong move.

187
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,135
Have you successfully
changed everything

188
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,704
about yourself as planned?

189
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:21,672
- Oh, yeah, you wouldn't
recognize me.

190
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:24,107
I'm wearing a sweater,
I bought new shoes,

191
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,109
I put something on my face
called "moisturizer."

192
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:27,811
It's amazing.
- Did you clean your car?

193
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:28,979
- I did, but it didn't
really take,

194
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:31,014
so I just rented a new one,
but here's the best part:

195
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,016
I printed out a sign
especially for him using

196
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,886
his favorite font, Garamond.

197
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,053
- Who has a favorite font?

198
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,790
- The Santiagos do.
All of them.

199
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:41,758
Oh, here he comes.
Gotta go, bye.

200
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:42,993
Hey, Mr. Santiago.

201
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,928
I am Jake Peralta,
Amy's boyfriend.

202
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:46,763
- Jake,
nice to finally meet you.

203
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:47,998
- You too.
- Ah, look at that.

204
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:49,833
You're a Garamond man, huh?

205
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:52,035
- Of course, what other font
would I use, Cambria?

206
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,904
[laughter]

207
00:06:53,937 --> 00:06:56,940
- Amy said you were a crack up,
but I had no idea.

208
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:58,742
- Oh, it's working.
- What?

209
00:06:58,775 --> 00:06:59,910
- Excuse me?
Shall we?

210
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:00,977
Let me get your bag.
- Sure.

211
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,216
- The two hunks have arrived.

212
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:08,719
- Hi.

213
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,120
So glad to have you here, Dad.

214
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:12,055
- Happy to be here, tiger.

215
00:07:12,088 --> 00:07:13,924
- How was your flight?
- Oh, good, good, you know,

216
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:16,259
I did "The Times" crossword.
- Oh, great puzzle to do, right?

217
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,695
- Oh, my God, 17 down?
- Oh, I know,

218
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,064
what about 16 across?
- What about 34 across?

219
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,766
- Oh, what about 45 down?

220
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,034
both: What about 20 across?

221
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:25,702
[laughter]

222
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,870
- I also did it.
- Yeah.

223
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:29,840
- So Jake and I had a great
conversation on the way here.

224
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,908
You didn't tell me he was so
interested in mutual funds.

225
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:32,876
- Uh...

226
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:35,111
- Yeah, ugh,
Amy is so bored of hearing me

227
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:38,815
talk about allocation,
asset mix, attribution analysis.

228
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,717
These are just terms
I throw around all the time.

229
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,885
- In alphabetical order.

230
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:43,086
- Well, that's just
how my brain works.

231
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,821
I mean, how would you list
financial terms,

232
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:46,757
in random order?
What are you, crazy?

233
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,191
- He's got a point.
I like this guy.

234
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:49,826
- [laughs]
Yeah.

235
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,962
Oh!
Captain Holt.

236
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:53,029
This is my dad.

237
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:54,097
- Captain,
heard a lot about you.

238
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,031
- And I you.

239
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:55,732
Do you mind passing me
those crab puffs?

240
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,901
- Oh, certainly.
There you go.

241
00:07:57,934 --> 00:07:58,902
- Thank you.

242
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:00,070
- Yeah.

243
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:04,274
- That was everything.

244
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:05,408
- Yeah, pretty big night:

245
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:08,011
the three most important men
in your life under one roof.

246
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,179
- Well, Will Shorts isn't here.

247
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:11,147
- Oh.
Burn on Holt... probably.

248
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,448
That's the one
you were talking about.

249
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,118
- The Cairn Terrier
is intelligent and inquisitive

250
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:15,952
with a bold personality.

251
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:18,121
- [chuckles]
"A bold personality."

252
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,756
We know what that's code for:

253
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,924
you're the bitch.

254
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:23,760
- Pimento is back.
How's the dog show going?

255
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,961
- Well,
it's not without its drama.

256
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,930
Whoever groomed the Irish Setter
might want to think about

257
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:27,931
blowing his brains out.

258
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:30,133
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
how's that Wire Fox Terrier?

259
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,002
Still in the lead?
- In the lead?

260
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:34,404
I doubt she even wins her group.
- What?

261
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:38,074
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,
don't say that!

262
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:40,143
What?
She's not gonna win?

263
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:43,980
Ooh, I bet the check you gave me
on the Wire Fox Terrier to win.

264
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:44,981
- Why would you do that?

265
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:47,283
That money was to help you
get a PI license.

266
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,119
- Yeah, but I wanted to
pay you back fast.

267
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:51,087
You made it sound like
the terrier was a sure thing.

268
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:52,322
You said she was majestic.

269
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:53,890
- They're all majestic.

270
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:56,026
This is a nationally-televised
dog show.

271
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:56,993
This is the big time.

272
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:58,895
Listen, mister,
I didn't give you that money

273
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:00,263
so you could throw it away.
I want it back.

274
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:01,965
We're gonna
pay your bookie a visit.

275
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:02,966
- What?
- And so help me God,

276
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,335
you better hope I don't miss
the "in memoriam."

277
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:07,103
- If it's dead dogs
you wanna see,

278
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:09,405
I know where to get my hands on
dozens of them.

279
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,207
- All right, choo-choo!

280
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:13,343
Here comes the veggie train,
leaving the station.

281
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,178
Next stop, a healthy body.

282
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,814
- Terry has kids.
Just carrots for me.

283
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,149
I don't eat celery,
hate the stuff.

284
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:20,216
- Oh, that's funny.
Me too.

285
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,885
- Really?
Get out of town.

286
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:23,053
Even though everybody says...

287
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:24,888
both: They're basically
the same thing.

288
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:25,922
[chuckling]

289
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:28,058
- I'm gonna go get a refill.
Do you want something?

290
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:29,826
- Oh, uh, you know,
if they have it,

291
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,294
maybe, like,
a dry Riesling?

292
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,163
- Excellent choice.
- Thank you.

293
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:35,465
They definitely have it.
I brought it.

294
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:38,334
- Wow, you are really
pulling this off.

295
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:41,171
- I know, all this research
is actually gonna work.

296
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:42,372
Should I prepare for things
all the time?

297
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:43,907
- Yeah.
- Nah, that's crazy.

298
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,341
- Look, I can't believe
you memorized

299
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,943
that whole, huge binder.

300
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,111
- Oh, I didn't.
I brought it with me

301
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:49,913
and hid it out on the stoop.

302
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:51,147
- So do you have
a favorite watchmaker?

303
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:55,018
- I do, but I actually have to
run to the bathroom real quick.

304
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,153
[seedy music]

305

Watches...

00:09:58,188 --> 00:09:59,155
Gotcha.

307
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:00,857
I guess if I had to pick
one watch,

308
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,092
it would be NOMOS Glashutte.

309
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,094
It's a German company
based in Saxony.

310
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:05,328
Speaking of which,
I think I just dropped

311
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,097
a bit of a Glashutte
in the baño.

312
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,198
Steer clear.

313
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:10,066
The only downside is,
I've told him I have to pee

314
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,401
so much he thinks I have a UTI.

315
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:13,336
I wonder if he's ever had a UTI.

316
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:14,905
You know what,
I'm gonna sneak outside

317
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:17,240
and get the 411 on the UTI.
BRB.

You looking for this?

- What?
Oh, no.

322

Pretty cool, huh?

I feel like Dexter.
I think.

I never actually saw the show.

327
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,161
Billboard gave me nightmares.

- Charles, are you crazy?

329
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:43,199
No, I don't want to watch
a living animal die

330
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:44,400
and then consume its flesh.

331
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:46,102
- How is this different
than eating a turkey

332
00:10:46,136 --> 00:10:46,970
that's been killed in a factory?

333
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,338
- Because I don't
have to see that.

334
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:50,240
It's called
living in denial, you moron.

335

- Gina, I know it seems cruel,
but it's a swift death.

One painless chop
removes the head.

- I mean, that doesn't
sound so bad.

338

corpse only flops around

00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:10,393
- Go ahead,
cut Nikolaj's throat.

345
00:11:10,426 --> 00:11:12,328
- Sorry, Gina,
but we need a turkey,

346
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:14,064
and you're
the only one complaining.

347
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:16,332
- I don't like it either.
It's not a fair fight.

348
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,168
Give the bird a gun,
then see what happens.

349
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,235
Sarge, this must
bother you too.

350
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:22,172
- Yeah, but eating
a big drumstick on Thanksgiving

351
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:23,206
makes Terry feel like a king.

352
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,041
- Sorry,
but it's five against two.

353
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,310
- Wait, you assume Hitchcock
and I want to eat that turkey?

354
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:29,045
- Yeah...?
- Thank you.

355
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,047
- Charles,
do what you need to do.

356
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,082
- Copy that.

357
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:34,184
- Uh-uh, no, hold up.

358
00:11:34,217 --> 00:11:36,086
Rosa, get the bird.
- On it.

359
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:39,522
- I'll stand here and sacrifice
my life to Charles's bloodlust.

360
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,224
- I'm not gonna kill you, Gina.

361
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:44,127
- Huh, then you already lost.

362
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,961
- No, where are you going?

363
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:47,097
Hey, you can run,
but you can't hide.

364
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,465
The apartment will run red
with the blood of Nikolaj.

365
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,500
- Please stop calling him that.

366
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:54,905
- So, uh, what are you
doing out here?

367
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:57,540
- Sneaking a cigarette.
I just can't quit.

368
00:11:57,573 --> 00:11:59,876
But you knew that, didn't you?
Page 136.

369
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,078
- What is that strange book
you're holding?

370
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:03,446
I've never seen it before.

371
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,482
- "Jake Peralta's Guide to
Tricking Amy's Dad."

372
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:07,583
- What?
Who put that there?

373
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:08,718
Why did I use
a title page?

374
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:11,621
- Relax, Jake, it's okay.
Actually, I'm quite impressed.

375
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:12,989
- You are?
- Yeah, you did a ton

376
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,624
of research here.
You made a binder.

377
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:15,558
This is real Santiago stuff.

378
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:18,628
- Yeah, I-I guess it is.
I even used tabs.

379
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:19,429
- The good ones.
- Yes.

380
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:20,496
There are good and bad types
of tabs.

381
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,465
That's something we all know.
- I can't believe

382
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:24,600
you did all this.
You've got my family tree,

383
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:27,437
all of my case files,
lot of photos.

384
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,371
- Yes, and might I add,

385
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:30,673
your ponytail in the 90s
puts Amy's to shame.

386
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,008
- They used to call me
"The Lion."

387
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,443
- Wow, cool nickname.

388
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:35,178
They call me "The Barracuda."

389
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:37,047
Well, I call me that.
I'm hoping it catches on.

390
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,214
- I was wondering
what you thought about

391
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:40,550
one of my cases...

392
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,052
First Essex Bank Heist.

393
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,553
- Yes, I read that one.

394
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:45,455
They got robbed the day before
their grand opening.

395
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,257
- I never solved that one.

396
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,059
That bothered me for 20 years.

397
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:51,027
But I see that you wrote
a note here that says,

398
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,229
"Contractor did it,
so obvious."

399
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:54,564
- Oh, what?

400
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,266
Well, you know us millennials,

401
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:57,633
we're always exaggerating.

402
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:58,634
But what I think
happened there is,

403
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:00,570
is that I was reading that file,
and I noticed

404
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:02,672
that the contractor,
Russo, was the, um—

405
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,975
- Obvious?
- Obvious suspect, but only

406
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:06,009
in the sense that he was
the only one who could've

407
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,610
possibly done it 'cause
he had the blueprint.

408
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:10,113
- I talked to Russo.
He had an alibi.

409
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:11,681
- Of course, of course.

410
00:13:11,714 --> 00:13:14,050
But, you know, the name of the
company was "Russo and Sons,"

411
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:18,288
so... I figure probably, maybe,
definitely the sons did it.

412
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:20,523
Maybe. Probably.
For sure.

413
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:22,692
- Sons?
Oh, my God, the sons.

414
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:24,060
I think you might be
on to something.

415
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,061
- Really?
- I don't know

416
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,496
how I missed that.

417
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:27,697
I bet they still live
here in New York.

418
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,165
We should go
talk to them right now.

419
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,267
I mean, if that would be okay.

420
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:32,068
- "Okay," are you kidding me?

421
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,736
I would love to work
a case with you.

422
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:34,670
That's amazing.

423
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:37,607
Looks like The Lion is
gonna roar again.

424
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,742
And the Barracuda is gonna...

425
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:41,577
- What?

426
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:43,313
- [fluttering]

427
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:44,614
Anyway, you get it, let's go.

428
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:45,648
[knocking]

429
00:13:46,716 --> 00:13:48,251
- Your bookie lives
in a college dorm?

430
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,619
- He's a freshman.
They don't let them

431
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:52,522
live off-campus first year.
Doi.

432
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:55,225
- Hey, Adrian, come on in.
Happy Thanksgiving, man.

433
00:13:55,258 --> 00:13:56,559
- Can it, Alan.

434
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:58,561
Listen, I need the money back,

435
00:13:58,594 --> 00:13:59,562
and I need it back now.

436
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:00,763
- Aw, geez, I'm sorry.

437
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,632
I can't do that.
I placed the bet online.

438
00:14:02,665 --> 00:14:03,733
It's not like I can cancel it.

439
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:05,335
- You just placed the bet
online?

440
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:06,669
- Yeah.
He could've done it himself.

441
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:07,770
It's really easy.

442
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,739
I kept telling him there's
no need for bookies anymore.

443
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:11,707
- No, no, no, I don't mess
with computers, okay?

444
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,610
Ever since I died of dysentery
on the Oregon Trail, I was like,

445
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:16,646
no thank you.
I'm done with this.

446
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,148
- Okay, look, the money's
already in the Caribbean.

447
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:19,149
There's nothing I can do.

448
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:20,650
- Looks like we're going

449
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:22,118
to the Caribbean.

450
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,655
[imitates guitar riff]

451
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:27,357
- You do know we're not
going to the Caribbean, right?

452
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,126
- I didn't know that.
That is a bummer.

453
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,694
- [grunts]
Come on, guys.

454
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:33,596
It's getting late.
Open the door.

455
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:35,598
- Not until you promise
to let this little turkey

456
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:37,600
live out the rest
of his life with Rosa.

457
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:39,102
- What?
Why can't it live with you?

458
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:40,136
- I'm an ideas man.

459
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,272
- All right, that's it.
You've left me no choice.

460
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,674
[exciting music]

461
00:14:44,707 --> 00:14:46,576
There we go.

462
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:48,078
Thanks.

463
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:49,245
Now give us the bird.

464
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,147
- Gladly.
Whoop, whoop—

465
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,282
- Not that bird.

466
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:53,616
- Don't take another step.

467
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,118
- This ends now.

468
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,586
I am so sorry, girl.

469
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:58,421
Great party, but uh-uh.

470
00:14:58,454 --> 00:14:59,655
All right, here it is.

471
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:01,691
Be free, noble bird.

472
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:04,694
Be free, fly away.
Fly to freedom.

473
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,296
- Gina, turkeys can't fly.

474
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:07,130
['Jaws" theme]
- [gasps]

475
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:08,631
Why is he looking at me
like that?

476
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:10,233
[chattering]

477
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:11,434
- Nobody make
any sudden moves.

478
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,369
- Yeah, and those talons
are super sharp, huh?

479
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:15,438
- That thing's
a freaking dinosaur.

480
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,441
[all screaming]

481
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:21,444
[dramatic music]

482
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:23,213
[thud]
[turkey squawks]

483
00:15:23,246 --> 00:15:25,848
- So, where were you
the day the bank was robbed?

484
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,850
- I don't understand, Dad.
What's going on?

485
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,420
- Well, honey, this man...
- The Barracuda.

486
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,622
- Wants to talk to me
about something that happened

487
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:35,225
20 years ago,
and as I said to that man—

488
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:36,692
- The Lion.
[hisses]

489
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:39,095
- 20 years ago,
I was in Pittsburgh

490
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,630
at a softball tournament.

491
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:41,697
- Oh, Pittsburgh, interesting.

492
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:42,698
Home of the Bengals.

493
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:43,566
- Home of the Steelers.

494
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,335
- No, this is
the home of the stealers.

495
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:46,469
I set you up perfectly for that.

496
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,638
While you were busy
establishing an alibi,

497
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,740
your sons were back in Brooklyn
robbing the bank.

498
00:15:50,773 --> 00:15:52,342
- But we were at
the softball tournament too.

499
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,377
- Oh, convenient you say that
now when you have no proof.

500
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,878
- Didn't you guys
bring back a trophy?

501
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,380
- A trophy's not really proof.

502
00:15:57,413 --> 00:15:59,715
- We also have a framed
photograph of the team,

503
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:02,685
a videotape of the whole event,
39 eye-witnesses,

504
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:04,454
a newspaper article about it,

505
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:06,289
and security footage
from the gas stations

506
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:08,291
we stopped at on the way
to and from Pittsburgh.

507
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,293
- Okay, I gotta say,
it seems a little weird

508
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:11,827
you're so prepared
for these questions.

509
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:12,895
- No, it's not.

510
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:15,198
My brother and I had to gather
all that information

511
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:16,766
20 years ago
when we got accused of

512
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,501
the exact same stuff by him.

513
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:19,902
- Say what now?

514
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,472
