1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,258
Five, four, three, two, and step.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,529
And step, and knees around the world.

3
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:07,832
Great form, Captain.

4
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:09,734
Your calves are looking toit.

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,503
Peralta, what're you
doing at Razzmatazz?

6
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:13,406
We needed to talk somewhere
outside the precinct.

7
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:14,675
Diaz? You are here too.

8
00:00:14,742 --> 00:00:16,411
- Great.
- Yeah.

9
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:19,648
Sir, we've discovered that
Lieutenant Hawkins is dirty.

10
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:22,652
Her squad isn't investigating
the Golden Gang bank robbers,

11
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,956
they are the robbers.

12
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,659
- Knees up in the back.
- Sorry, Brenda.

13
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,028
If Hawkins is robbing banks,

14
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:28,730
why did she invite you
onto her task force?

15
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:31,868
And squat and hold and work those quads.

16
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:33,570
We were working on a case
that could have exposed her.

17
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:34,739
This way she can keep tabs on us.

18
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:37,309
Turn it. Get down.

19
00:00:37,377 --> 00:00:38,811
God, why is this so hard for me?

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,582
- Do I even have quads?
- And twirl.

21
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,319
Normally, I'd say we'd report
this to Internal Affairs...

22
00:00:44,387 --> 00:00:46,722
- And twirl back.
- But Hawkins is one of

23
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,659
the most revered detectives in the NYPD.

24
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:52,097
- And hula hands.
- If you're gonna go after her,

25
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:53,932
you'd better have the
proof to back it up.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,835
Well, then I guess that only
leaves us with one option.

27
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:57,838
And now wag those tails.

28
00:00:57,906 --> 00:01:00,008
Find out everything we
can about the squad.

29
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:01,944
And take her down from the inside.

30
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:04,748
- Keep wagging back there.
- I am wagging, Brenda.

31
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:26,780
Morning, Lieutenant Hawkins.

32
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:29,717
Hey, have you ever considered
going by Lady Hawk?

33
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,754
Pretty sweet flick. Matty Broderick,

34
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:34,157
Shelly Pfeiffer, Alf Molina.

35
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:35,893
Not to be confused with Alf, Alf.

36
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:37,463
- We all love him.
- What do you want?

37
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,964
We ran background checks
on all the employees

38
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,166
of the three banks that were hit.

39
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,602
- Nothing interesting.
- Run checks

40
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,003
on all the family members.

41
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:44,406
Or we could get to
know each other better

42
00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:45,740
and join you in the field.

43
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:47,443
Or you could run a background check.

44
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:49,113
Lieutenant, the manager
of the Capital Trust Bank

45
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,748
- in Fort Greene is here.
- Oh, yeah.

46
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,083
- Was that bank even hit?
- We brought him in

47
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:53,752
because we think it might
be the next target.

48
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,787
Is that standard procedure?

49
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:56,656
You ask a lot of questions.

50
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,595
She really doesn't. One
time I broke my arm,

51
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:00,929
and she didn't even
ask me what happened,

52
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:04,602
and it was a really funny story.

53
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,605
Wow, now nobody's asking what happened?

54
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:07,839
This is insane.

55
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:10,176
Okay, I should be back in an hour.

56
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:11,979
If my desk phone rings, just ignore it.

57
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:14,015
- I don't answer it anyway.
- You shouldn't tell me

58
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,951
- stuff like that.
- Where's Gina going?

59
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,821
That's, like, the third time
she's taken off this week.

60
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,022
She has a doctor's appointment.

61
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,458
You know what that's code for.

62
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:21,826
She's taking a nap in the furnace room.

63
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:23,228
Is that what you do?

64
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:24,964
Because you really
should go to the doctor.

65
00:02:25,032 --> 00:02:26,466
When you breathe it sounds
like someone's shaking

66
00:02:26,535 --> 00:02:28,736
- a bag of quarters.
- You're right.

67
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:30,805
I'll go to the doctor right now.

68
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:32,808
Sarge, you think Gina will be okay?

69
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:35,045
She says the doctor's can't be
sure, but they're optimistic.

70
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,851
Apparently, she has something
called Ansel-Elgort Syndrome.

71
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:38,984
- Oh, poor Gina.
- Oh, my God.

72
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:40,654
Oh, you fools.

73
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:43,224
That's not a disease.
Ansel Elgort's an actor.

74
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:44,993
Did none of you see "The
Fault in Our Stars"?

75
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,261
No. Why did you?

76
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,164
Teenage romance, dying chick,

77
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:49,567
oxygen mask.

78
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:51,836
Checks all my boxes.

79
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:53,773
So what's really going on with Gina?

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,776
Wait. You don't think...

81
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,511
That she hates work and
doesn't wanna be here?

82
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,181
- Yeah, I do think.
- No, that she's pregnant.

83
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,917
It all makes sense now.

84
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:03,920
Last week, I brought in
unpasteurized boar's milk

85
00:03:03,988 --> 00:03:05,223
and she refused to drink any.

86
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,192
Not a real convincing argument, Boyle.

87
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,061
No, I think Charles might be right.

88
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:10,897
Yesterday, I asked her
to go for a drink,

89
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:13,033
and she said, "That
sounds like a nightmare."

90
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:14,102
- Oh, Amy.
- Okay.

91
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,537
Just give me this, please.

92
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:16,739
I'd feel so much better about my self

93
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:18,040
if it was because she was pregnant.

94
00:03:18,108 --> 00:03:21,613
Oh, my God, look what
Gina was working on.

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,816
"Volcano,"Tibia,"JerHonor,"

96
00:03:23,883 --> 00:03:26,286
"Concretius,"The Enigma."
Oh, she's lost her mind.

97
00:03:26,354 --> 00:03:28,656
No, look at what the file is called.

98
00:03:28,724 --> 00:03:30,292
BabyNames. doc.

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,895
You guys, Gina's gonna have a baby.

100
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,000
We're clear.

101
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,569
What was wrong with the step class?

102
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:38,938
Too public. Couldn't take the risk.

103
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:41,575
Also, one of us yarfed all
over himself after the class.

104
00:03:41,643 --> 00:03:43,611
Yeah, and it doesn't matter
which one of us he was.

105
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,347
So what kind of dirt did
you dig up on Hawkins?

106
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,851
Nothing concrete, but we think
we know their next target:

107
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:49,619
Capital Trust Bank, Fort Greene Branch.

108
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,990
As part of our investigation
into the Golden Gang,

109
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:54,827
she managed to get alarm
schematics and blueprints.

110
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:56,697
It's the perfect cover. She's so smooth.

111
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,332
Oh, yeah, she's a smooth criminal.

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,001
MJ, RIP.

113
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,771
The problem is, we're not
in her inner circle.

114
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:04,374
She barely talks to us, and
I've been super charming.

115
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:06,277
So...

116
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:09,648
what you binging these days?

117
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,984
What? Everyone's binging these days.

118
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:12,353
It's how we consume content.

119
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:14,288
We need to find out a
way to earn her trust.

120
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:16,826
Normally, I'd say work hard,
prove you're good cops,

121
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,795
but she doesn't want
good cops around her.

122
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:21,031
Oh, dip. That's right, Captain.

123
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,400
She doesn't want good cops around her.

124
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:24,303
We're just gonna have to convince her

125
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:26,406
- that we're dirty.
- How do you plan to do that?

126
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,976
With the help of the
sketchiest dude we know.

127
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:30,713
I am so honored you guys thought of me.

128
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,903
You're not gonna regret this.

129
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:36,353
So, Adrian...

130
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:37,962
Working from home, hum? What
happened to the office?

131
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,113
Couldn't afford the rent.

132
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:40,427
I'll be honest with you guys,

133
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:42,634
this PI thing is not going great.

134
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,237
Got a couple of bad reviews online,

135
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:45,539
and that pretty much tanked me.

136
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:47,742
I mean, what does "weird
energy" even mean?

137
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,344
- Am I right?
- Well, my guess is that

138
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,348
people find you somewhat
threatening and erratic.

139
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,552
Okay, yeah. That tracks.

140
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:56,754
But jokes on them 'cause
I'm having tons of fun

141
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:59,024
with all this free time.
Catching up on reading,

142
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:00,727
going for walks. It's great.

143
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:02,663
The other day, I walked
all the way to Maryland.

144
00:05:02,731 --> 00:05:04,331
- Gorgeous.
- Well, listen,

145
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,367
- we need your help.
- Great, who are we killing?

146
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:08,504
I won't do kids. That's a rule.

147
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:10,774
But that rule is negotiable
if the kids a dick.

148
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,375
No, babe, we don't want
you to kill anyone.

149
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:13,611
- What? Really?
- No.

150
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,179
We need to make Lieutenant Hawkins think

151
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:16,515
that Diaz and Peralta are dirty.

152
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,350
When you went undercover in the mob,

153
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,719
how did you convince them
you could be trusted?

154
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,422
Easy. You just take one of their guys

155
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,590
and beat him to a pulp in front of them.

156
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,192
Well, that's all well and good,

157
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,427
but we're not actually dirty.

158
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:26,796
We can't just beat somebody up.

159
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:29,433
What if that someone
gave you permission?

160
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:31,034
Babe, do you want us to beat you up?

161
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:33,772
Ugh, yes, please.
Anything to feel alive.

162
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,708
I was lying before about
enjoying walking.

163
00:05:35,776 --> 00:05:37,244
It sucks,

164
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:39,546
and Maryland is a giant pile of garbage.

165
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:42,116
Okay, so we beat the
crap out of my fiancé.

166
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,619
- And you're okay with this?
- Yeah.

167
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:45,622
- I just want him to be happy.
- Aww.

168
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,159
You guys are a weird couple,
but it appears we have a plan.

169
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:49,660
Okay, here are the ground rules:

170
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:51,730
You can punch me, kick me, pull my hair,

171
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:54,233
I am a-ok being stabbed,

172
00:05:54,301 --> 00:05:56,837
biting and scratching are on the table,

173
00:05:56,905 --> 00:06:00,074
- you can use fire.
- These are the ground rules?

174
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,144
Is there anything off limits?

175
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:03,679
Damn, man.

176
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:05,582
You got something really
sick you wanna do, huh?

177
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,351
Oh, you little pervert.

178
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,488
All right, I like it. Don't tell me.

179
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:12,158
Surprise me. Ooh, this is gonna be fun.

180
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:14,093
Now remember,

181
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:16,363
if she's expecting, she'll
tell us when she's ready.

182
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:18,099
I don't know how she
could keep this from me.

183
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,868
I'm her brother. I mean,
when Genevieve and I

184
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:21,804
knew we were going to adopt,
I told her immediately.

185
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:23,707
- You told everyone.
- Put your hands up,

186
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,543
and start clapping for me

187
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:28,814
'cause I'm gonna be a daddy.

188
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:30,449
Aww, thank you.

189
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,385
You're gonna need to hold your horses

190
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:34,288
and respect Gina's privacy.

191
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:35,890
Fine, I will.

192
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:38,460
What the hell? Is she drinking coffee?

193
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:41,331
Boyle, no.

194
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:43,801
- What're you doing, you psycho?
- What're you doing?

195
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:45,303
You shouldn't be drinking caffeine.

196
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,304
That can stunt the growth of your ba...

197
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,477
- No, no, no, no.
- By, your baby.

198
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:52,246
Excuse me? What are you trying to say?

199
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,681
Nothing. We don't think your pregnant.

200
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,384
Sharon's pregnant. Uh, that's not true.

201
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:56,752
God, I hope it's not true.

202
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,755
What if Sharon's pregnant?

203
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:00,658
Well, it would appear you've
figured out my little secret.

204
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,827
We don't know no secret. You be crazy.

205
00:07:02,895 --> 00:07:05,697
I always talk like this. Down in Kokomo.

206
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,333
Mm-kay. It's fine.

207
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,570
You might as well know. I am with child.

208
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,840
- Congratulations.
- Yes, I'm gonna be an uncle.

209
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:13,375
I'm gonna be an uncle. All right,

210
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:14,610
someone take a picture
of me kissing her belly.

211
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,580
- Negative, get out.
- Okay, fine,

212
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:17,714
but you have to tell us everything.

213
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:19,617
How do you feel? When are you due?

214
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:21,352
Oh, my God, I don't even
know who the father is.

215
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,888
- Who's the father?
- Who's the father?

216
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,959
Well, let's just say he's
a destroyer of worlds,

217
00:07:26,027 --> 00:07:29,864
- and I am his moon and stars.
- Amazing.

218
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,934
I still need his name, phone
number, and shirt size.

219
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,304
I have a fun group
Halloween costume idea.

220
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,940
I won't tell you what it is.

221
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:37,942
It's "Three Men and a
Baby." You're Guttenberg.

222
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,545
Right, well, I would love
to give you that info,

223
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:43,884
but there's one little problem.

224
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:45,719
I signed a non-disclosure agreement,

225
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:47,989
which bars me from
revealing his identity.

226
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,559
Wait, is he famous.

227
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:53,563
- Is it Batali?
- Charles, she can't say.

228
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:55,733
- Is it Batali?
- Legally, I cannot say.

229
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:58,637
I'm so sorry, guys, but
I can give you a hint,

230
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,907
He real famous.

231
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:02,943
Ooh, y'all are agog.

232
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:06,848
Textbook agog. Come on,
fetus, let's bounce.

233
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,452
- This way, D-bag.
- Get your pig hands off me.

234
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,821
- You pigs!
- Hey, who's this?

235
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:12,522
Now who's asking a lot of questions.

236
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,425
Ooh, schnoops.

237
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:16,595
You said that to her before and
then she flipped it on you.

238
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,032
You got flipped on, son.

239
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,834
What did I do? I didn't
do anything wrong.

240
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:22,036
Really? 'Cause you haven't paid us

241
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:23,772
in a week.

242
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,941
Oh, God, I swear. I'll
get you the money.

243
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,610
I just need a little more...

244
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:29,546
Oh, my God, you really punched me.

245
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:31,615
Oh, my God, that hurt.

246
00:08:31,684 --> 00:08:33,018
- Are you okay?
- What?

247
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:34,487
Yeah, this is my character.
I'm a coward.

248
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:35,955
Come on. Give me everything you got.

249
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:37,791
Oh.

250
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:39,326
Where's our money?

251
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,496
Oh, my kidneys.

252
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,465
Oh, I'm pretty sure I'm
bleeding internally.

253
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:45,802
- Oh, God.
- Get up.

254
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,905
I am so sorry.

255
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,306
Why? It's going great.

256
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:50,509
Punch me really hard in the stomach.

257
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:51,977
Oh, okay.

258
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,480
I think you broke my ribs.

259
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:57,985
Ah, you're really hurting me.
Please, stop hurting me.

260
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:01,390
What are you doing? I
said stop hurting me.

261
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,825
What? I thought you were in character.

262
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:04,061
No, no, I don't have health insurance.

263
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,495
- This could bankrupt me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

264
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:06,864
I'm just very confused. Come on.

265
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,568
Get us the money by Friday

266
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,603
or I'll break more than your ribs.

267
00:09:11,671 --> 00:09:14,507
Jake.

268
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:17,379
We're being watched? Uh-oh.

269
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:20,783
How many times have I smacked you

270
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,951
- in your face?
- Lost count.

271
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,687
And you still have no fear of me.

272
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:24,788
I'm trying to read your womb vibe.

273
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,524
Exactly. Knock it off.

274
00:09:26,592 --> 00:09:27,959
The daddy's your Property
Brother, isn't he?

275
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,728
- It's a Property Baby.
- Charles, you know

276
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:30,964
I legally can't answer.

277
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:32,532
Do you want me to have my baby in jail?

278
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,968
All right, no more questions.
Only statements.

279
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:35,870
You are glowing.

280
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:37,873
Brother to sister, you've
never looked sexier.

281
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:39,542
Come on, man.

282
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,977
Uh, you guys, I would
love to stay and chat

283
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:43,547
about my unborn king or queen,

284
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:45,817
but I just got a text from...

285
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,386
redacted,

286
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,122
and he wants to take me
to a fancy lunch at...

287
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,724
redacted,

288
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,094
so I gotta get outta
here, but you know what?

289
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:55,731
I'll be back at redacted o'clock.

290
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,738
Bye.

291
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:03,909
Okay, so she's going to meet
the father of her child,

292
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:06,746
- and it is break time...
- And you better believe

293
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,482
- that we're gonna follow her.
- Yes.

294
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,151
The only celebrity I've
ever seen in real life

295
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:11,653
was Paul Shaffer.

296
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:14,023
- It was exhilarating.
- I bet.

297
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:16,660
Be careful. Don't let her see us.

298
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,862
Then you should have got a
disguise like me, idiots.

299
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,532
Why do you even own that?

300
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,668
I was banned from Wing Sluts
for using too much sauce,

301
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,604
so I got it to sneak past the hostess.

302
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:25,872
So far it has not worked.

303
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,776
Wait, look. There's no fancy lunch.

304
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:31,480
There's no fancy guy. She lied to us.

305
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,150
"Redacted" my ass.

306
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,619
What's up?

307
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,188
So not sure if Paxton told you,

308
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:39,057
but we brought a perp in earlier.

309
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,526
Good-looking guy, weird energy.

310
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:41,694
Yeah, did you get anything?

311
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:43,062
He didn't know jack,

312
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:44,965
but we surprisingly noticed

313
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,534
that there was a camera in the room.

314
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:47,802
And we really need that footage.

315
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,004
- Why?
- Let's just say,

316
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:50,806
in the course of questioning him,

317
00:10:50,874 --> 00:10:53,143
he may have accidentally fallen down

318
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:54,879
- a couple of times.
- He's real clumsy.

319
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,815
If the wrong person saw that tape,

320
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:58,817
they might get the wrong idea.

321
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:02,256
You know, I saw the tape,
and it was shocking

322
00:11:02,324 --> 00:11:04,659
how clumsy that guy actually was.

323
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:07,730
- Right?
- And the funny thing is,

324
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:09,832
I meant to save the file,

325
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,236
but I deleted it by accident.

326
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:13,671
Guess we're all a little clumsy.

327
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,939
Yes, indeed.

328
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,875
I stepped on my omelet this morning.

329
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,012
Not pertinent, let's continue
with our covert conversation.

330
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,282
You know, a bunch of us are
going out drinking tonight.

331
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,619
- You wanna come?
- You know it.

332
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,587
But I should probably warn you,

333
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:27,023
me and Rosa go pretty hard.

334
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,691
Great. Bring some coke.

335
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,094
Oh, so you mean, hard, hard.

336
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:31,763
- Hmm.
- Okay, sweet.

337
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:33,131
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
sweet, sweet, sweet,

338
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:35,034
sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.

339
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:38,526
Cocaine. Coc-a-ina.

340
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:39,737
- No.
- No?

341
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,658
What happened to Hawkins,

342
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,610
did she take the bait
like a stupid fish?

343
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:45,846
Yeah, she invited us to go
out with her gang tonight.

344
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,010
- Nice.
- Speaking of which, Captain,

345
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,380
any luck getting coke out of evidence?

346
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:52,986
One bag of primo blow,
as is the parlance.

347
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:55,122
I still have reservations
about this plan.

348
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,992
Perhaps you could say
your dealer ran out

349
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,862
or he's summering in Nantucket.

350
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:00,898
No, this is perfect. If she gets wasted,

351
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:02,334
maybe she'll get sloppy
and start talking.

352
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,503
Plus, I mean, I can teach you guys

353
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:06,206
how to fake take real drugs like a pro.

354
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:08,009
I used to do it all the
time when I was undercover.

355
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,246
All you gotta do is close your
nostril when you go down.

356
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,148
Watch this.

357
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:14,385
Oh, nope. I didn't do it that time.

358
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:15,921
I got a full snout full. Whoo.

359
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:18,057
Okay, no,
let me just try again.

360
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,560
I'm a little rusty. All you gotta do,

361
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:21,329
just close the old nost-a-roni, and...

362
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:23,332
Oh, boy, I got more than time.

363
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,168
Oh.

364
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:27,405
Whoa, where did you get this?

365
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:28,941
- Adrian, that's enough.
- Oh.

366
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,243
We can make fake cocaine for ourselves

367
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:32,380
- out of vitamin B powder.
- Ooh, vitamin B.

368
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:34,449
- The second-best vitamin.
- Guys, I'm telling you.

369
00:12:34,517 --> 00:12:36,219
The fake snorting can work. Watch.

370
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:37,354
Oh.

371
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,361
Oh, I got so much that time.

372
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,598
Whoa, ooh, anybody wanna listen
to Jamiroquai right now?

373
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,036
Okay, I'm just gonna move this
away from your nose holes.

374
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:48,638
Well, you two should get going.

375
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,541
If Hawkins tells you anything,
text me right away.

376
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:52,044
I'll stay here and watch Adrian.

377
00:12:52,111 --> 00:12:53,645
Who's Adrian? Yeah, all right!

378
00:12:53,713 --> 00:12:55,315
Hey, any of you guys play an instrument?

379
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:56,951
You know, I play a
little bit of bouzouki.

380
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,286
Anybody else play an ancient
stringed instrument?

381
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:00,056
No? You guys wanna go to the beach?

382
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:01,223
It's a beautiful day. Just
maybe, like, get out there.

383
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,960
Throw the disc around. Right?

384
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,395
Hey, have you ever been to the
Statue of Liberty, Captain?

385
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:06,065
Have you? Have you been inside?

386
00:13:06,132 --> 00:13:07,934
Like, under the skirt?
Like, what's up there?

387
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:09,570
Did they build a... You
know what I'm saying?

388
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:11,006
Oh, guys, watch this. I'm gonna juggle.

389
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:14,077
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

390
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:16,114
Admit it, Gina. There was no celebrity.

391
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,949
There was no fancy lunch at redacted.

392
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:19,685
Well, that's strange
because I remember eating

393
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:22,256
lobster-fed beef. It's the best kind.

394
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:25,127
The cows live by the sea
and they eat only lobster.

395
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,365
- We know you're lying.
- I am offended.

396
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,202
- Nay, outraged that...
- We saw you eating cheese pizza

397
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,338
- all alone.
- Oh, okay, then you caught me.

398
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,108
Gina, what is really going on?

399
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:36,111
- Immaculate conception?
- No.

400
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:38,047
Why did you make all that stuff up?

401
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:39,616
Because I value my privacy,

402
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,386
and it's like you guys are
always in my business,

403
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,489
- specifically Charles.
- Look, it's just that

404
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm your brother and I love
you, and I'm invested,

405
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:47,395
but if that's what you really want,

406
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,364
then I'll leave you alone.

407
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,535
Ugh, fine.

408
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:53,671
I'll tell you who the baby's father is,

409
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:57,477
- but you have to be chill.
- I will be so chill.

410
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,747
The baby daddy is a Boyle cousin.

411
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:01,583
It's a Boyle!

412
00:14:01,651 --> 00:14:03,086
Whoo!

413
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:05,256
Ugh, this place smells like...

414
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:06,658
Regret? Failure?

415
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,228
- Ketchup.
- Hey, Diaz, Peralta.

416
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:11,331
- Over here.
- What's up, Lieutenant?

417
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,734
Cell phones in the bag.

418
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,336
- Why?
- It's standard procedure.

419
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:16,106
We don't like having phones at parties.

420
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:18,576
Right, it's like, "Look up
from your screens people.

421
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:20,546
"You're missing out on
the best app there is.

422
00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:22,348
- Real life."
- Well, you see, we're gonna be

423
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,585
doing a lot of drugs and we're cops,

424
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:25,787
so we don't want our pictures taken.

425
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:27,590
Yeah, your reason's better.

426
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,693
- Here you go.
- All right, then.

427
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:33,232
- Here we go.
- Let's get sloppy.

428
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,382
I like it.

429
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,054
You guys, I found out why Gina lied

430
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:49,124
about the non-disclosure agreement.

431
00:14:49,191 --> 00:14:50,559
Because of how invasive
and crazy you are?

432
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:52,729
Oh, Terry, you gullible little rube.

433
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:55,099
It's because of which cousin it is.

434
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,436
That's right. I found
out which Boyle seed

435
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:58,638
did the deed.

436
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,242
The father is Milton.

437
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,613
Who's Milton? We're not
a part of your family.

438
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,281
He's a total loser.

439
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,452
I mean, of all the Boyle's to bang,

440
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,255
why bang Milton Boyle?

441
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,158
- He's that bad?
- "He's that bad?"

442
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:14,295
Wow, Terry, you are a rube.
Milton's a troll.

443
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:16,766
Okay, look. We have to be supportive.

444
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,602
- Gina is our friend.
- Ugh.

445
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,805
Oh, my God, he's here.
You guys try not to puke

446
00:15:20,873 --> 00:15:22,275
all over yourselves when you see him.

447
00:15:22,342 --> 00:15:24,378
- Hi, Milton.
- Oh, hey, Charles.

448
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:26,347
- He's a Boyle?
- Right?

449
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,317
Don't look at his weird face.
You'll make him feel bad.

450
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,220
Hey, uh, have you seen Gina?

451
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:31,389
You mean ever?

452
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,292
Get more specific, Milton.

453
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,626
Milty!

454
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:36,196
Hey!

455
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:37,331
Mmm.

456
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,800
What're you doing here?

457
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:40,570
Thought I would take my warrior goddess

458
00:15:40,637 --> 00:15:42,873
- out to a surprise dinner.
- Oh, is the surprise

459
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,375
that you can afford dinner

460
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,810
since you dropped out of high school?

461
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,313
I left after junior year

462
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,381
to be a professional snowboarder.

463
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:50,184
- Oh.
- And now he owns

464
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:53,723
a winter apparel company that
donates snow to the poor.

465
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,759
- Water.
- You're so amazing.

466
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:58,330
You're so amazing.

467
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:02,236
Oh, they're dancing now.

468
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,738
Are you guys doing the Lambada?

469
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:05,674
Hmm, I guess we are.

470
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:08,412
I hadn't noticed. Sometimes
we just do that.

471
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,249
Aww, you guys make a cute couple.

472
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:13,353
You're welcome. Now enjoy
watching us leave.

473
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,289
Hey, I had a great idea for a baby name.

474
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:16,958
- What is it?
- If it's a girl,

475
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,861
how about "The Enigma"?

476
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:20,464
Oh, my God, I already thought of that,

477
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:22,300
and then if it's a boy,
it could just be...

478
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:24,971
"The Enigmo."

479
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,306
Bye, Charles. I love you.

480
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:28,376
Bye, Milton. I love you too.

481
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,279
Come on, Charles, you have to admit,

482
00:16:30,346 --> 00:16:31,714
they're perfect for each other.

483
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,317
Yeah, I guess I'm happy for her.

484
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,654
Let's just hope the baby
doesn't get his looks.

485
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:38,492
- What a dweeb.
- Nah, bro, he's hot.

486
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:42,398
Oh, wow, that's good stuff.

487
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:44,401
- Who's your guy?
- Actually, it's a woman.

488
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:47,004
Women can be drug
dealers too #ImWithHer.

489
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,907
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.

490
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,510
Not to be snobby,

491
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,613
but I got my own stash. It's the bomb.

492
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:54,316
Smuggled this vial in on a plane.

493
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,687
Stuck it right up my butt.

494
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:57,754
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

495
00:16:57,822 --> 00:16:59,023
I'm good with the non-butt coke.

496
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,627
Suit yourself.

497
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:04,765
Bartender made me my favorite drink.

498
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,369
- It's called a bottle of whiskey.
- I like your style.

499
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:08,604
You know, when I first met you two,

500
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:09,707
I thought you were pretty uptight.

501
00:17:09,774 --> 00:17:11,309
More like down loose.

502
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:12,711
That's nothing.

503
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:13,946
Hey, about the interrogation room.

504
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:15,349
Don't even worry about it.

505
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,783
Sometimes you gotta do stuff.

506
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:19,488
Me and my crew, sometimes
we gotta do stuff too.

507
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:20,857
Understood, and hey, look,

508
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:22,893
if you ever need help doing stuff,

509
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:24,796
- maybe keep us in mind.
- I will.

510
00:17:24,864 --> 00:17:27,400
Enough business, huh?

511
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,805
Yeah!

512
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:35,980
Yeah.

513
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,492
Wakey, wakey. Rise and shine.

514
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,528
- It's go time.
- Go time?

515
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,364
- What time go time?
- I said I'd keep you in mind.

516
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:49,367
Remember? Well, we got a job.

517
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,003
- What job?
- We're robbing a bank.

518
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,339
We always party the night before.

519
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:53,941
It keeps us loose.

520
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:56,011
Here are your masks.

521
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,615
Oh, great. Awesome.

522
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,918
Obviously, we're on board.
Just one thing,

523
00:18:00,986 --> 00:18:03,021
if Rosa doesn't eat
breakfast, she's a real bear.

524
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,857
Plus, I should go home, take a shower,

525
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,095
and gots to watch my
"Michael and Kelly."

526
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:08,697
We go now.

527
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:10,700
Sure, totally. Groban's
filling in anyway.

528
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:11,902
Let's go rob a bank.

529
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:16,955
All right, when we get there

530
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:18,938
we're going in hard, and
we're going in fast.

531
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:20,475
Paxton and I will take the vaults

532
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,578
'cause we know how to use the tools,

533
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:22,881
You two are on crowd control.

534
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,452
Make it clear you're in charge

535
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,289
or things could get messy.
Any questions?

536
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:27,391
- A million.
- No time.

537
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:29,062
Follow our lead.

538
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,100
Hey, what do we do?

539
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:33,005
We can't call for backup.
We gave 'em our phones.

540
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:35,410
We don't have our phones,
but we have a phone.

541
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:36,813
I picked it up at the bar last night.

542
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,820
Oh, my God, you have to tell
me more about your blues band,

543
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:41,089
and you guys are all accountants?

544
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:42,593
That's so fun.

545
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:44,631
I cannot figure you out, but I love it.

546
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:45,800
All right, let me text Holt.

547
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:47,504
This is Jake.

548
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:50,010
Robbing Fort Greene Branch right now.

549
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:52,549
Bring backup. Hurry.

550
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,688
Siren emoji, white hands clapping emoji,

551
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:55,856
brown hands clapping emoji.

552
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,026
- Just send it.
- Okay.

553
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,496
I just received a text from Peralta.

554
00:18:58,564 --> 00:18:59,900
I need everyone in full tactical gear

555
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,539
in three minutes. Move, move, move!

556
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:12,428
Okay, who says what? I'll
do the "everybody down"

557
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:13,597
- if no one's taken that.
- Shh.

558
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:15,936
Right, got it.

559
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:18,709
Everybody down!

560
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,881
I called that. Everybody down!

561
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:22,418
It's not as good. They're already down.

562
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:23,587
Palms on the floor! I
wanna see your hands!

563
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:25,057
I also wanna see your hands!

564
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,928
You're taking all the good lines.

565
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:28,766
Look alive, squad. We
don't have much time.

566
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,937
If anything happens to Jake,
I'll never forgive myself.

567
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:33,476
My last words to him were,
"No, you're the man."

568
00:19:33,544 --> 00:19:34,946
That actually sounds pretty nice, Boyle.

569
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,583
Nice isn't good enough, Sarge.

570
00:19:37,954 --> 00:19:39,257
Okay, everyone, be cool,

571
00:19:39,324 --> 00:19:41,462
and nobody's getting hurt.

572
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,631
They're almost done with the vaults.

573
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:43,834
When is the squad gonna get here?

574
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:48,076
- Peralta, cops.
- Yes.

575
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:50,482
I mean, oh, no, what a bummer.

576
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,587
The police. But still, maybe a lesson

577
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:54,826
for all of us that crime doesn't pay.

578
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,596
We go in the front door, we
use the wedge formation.

579
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:58,200
- On my command.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait,

580
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,605
wait, wait, wait for me!
I'm here, I'm here.

581
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:02,945
Okay, I followed you here
all the way on my bike.

582
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:04,849
- We were going very fast.
- I know.

583
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,221
I'm still pretty coked up.
Let's do this, Nine-Nine!

584
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,292
You are not a police officer.
You're not part of this mission.

585
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,029
Right, okay.

586
00:20:11,097 --> 00:20:13,568
Well, I'm just gonna go in
this bank and cash a check.

587
00:20:13,636 --> 00:20:15,306
Whatever happens happens. Am I right?

588
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:19,014
Let's do this!

589
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,052
NYPD, hands up, weapons down!

590
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,923
- Put 'em down, now!
- Masks off!

591
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:25,028
- Let's see your hands.
- Great work, boys.

592
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:27,100
We're cops.

593
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,372
- Wait, where's Captain Holt?
- Who's Captain Holt?

594
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:31,342
- I don't know a Captain Holt.
- What?

595
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,347
NYPD, put down your weapons!

596
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:35,084
- Oh!
- What the hell?

597
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:37,256
- What is happening?
- We're at the wrong bank.

598
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:41,132
I'm crashing.

599
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,402
We're NYPD officers.

600
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:44,072
This is an undercover operation.

601
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,077
That's a lie, Peralta.

602
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,948
You're the Golden Gang.

603
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:50,754
We've been onto you for weeks,
but we finally got you.

604
00:20:50,822 --> 00:20:52,391
Hawkins? How did you get over there?

605
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,162
- Who are they?
- You tell me.

606
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:55,732
They're your crew.

607
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,904
They got us, Jake. It's over.

608
00:20:57,972 --> 00:20:59,407
I've never seen them before.

609
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:02,314
- What is going on?
- Good job, everyone.

610
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:05,321
We finally got the Golden Gang.

611
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,994
I can't believe you thought
you were gonna take me down.

612
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:09,831
You are not gonna get away with this.

613
00:21:09,898 --> 00:21:11,802
Oh, I already did,

614
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,110
and Captain Holt won't be able
to get you out of this one.

615
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,848
Get them out of my sight.

616
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:18,685
Dirty cops make me sick!

617
00:21:18,753 --> 00:21:21,224
They make me sick! I'm the sick one!

618
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,362
She's dirty! I'm clean!

619
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,866
I'm a clean boy!
