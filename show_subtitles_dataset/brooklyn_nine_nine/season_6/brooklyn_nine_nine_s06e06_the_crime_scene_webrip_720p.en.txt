1
00:00:06,544 --> 00:00:08,807
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,548
The coffee guy was—
- Assaulting your head?

3
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:12,419
What is going on up there?
- Is it bad?

4
00:00:12,463 --> 00:00:14,160
- Before I answer
that question,

5
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:15,640
do you currently have
a knife on you?

6
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,032
- Yeah, several.
- Then I love it.

7
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:18,773
It really... is hair.
It's bad, Rosa.

8
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:20,471
You look like Edna
from "The Incredibles."

9
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:21,950
I'm sorry, don't stab me.

10
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:23,604
- My girlfriend Jocelyn's
been practicing

11
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,171
a bunch of different hairstyles
on me.

12
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:26,607
She's in cosmetology school.

13
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,696
- Is she... passing?
- Honestly, I don't know.

14
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,176
- Well, let's get into
this murder.

15
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:32,787
I'm hoping it's a dope one.

16
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:36,312
Mamma mia.
That's a bloody pizza pie.

17
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:37,488
- No, it's okay.

18
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:38,750
I can say that.
I'm half Italian.

19
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,752
- That's not the problem
I had with it.

20
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,797
- Detectives. The vacuum
was running when we got here.

21
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:44,451
Smeared blood
across the entire apartment.

22
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:45,626
- Is this dope enough for you?

23
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,975
- I mean,
it's a bloody robot, Rosa.

24
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,499
It's clearly a good start,
but it's gonna take

25
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:49,848
more than that
to be certified as dope.

26
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,458
Who's the vic?
- Name is Andrew Adams.

27
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:52,720
- Kind of a boring name.
Not dope.

28
00:00:52,764 --> 00:00:54,026
- He's an investigative
reporter.

29
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:55,506
- Dope.
What was he investigating?

30
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:56,811
- Chicken farming.

31
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:58,117
- Sharp turn away
from dopeness,

32
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,727
but who found the body?

33
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:01,686
- His boss called the cops
when he didn't show up to work,

34
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,078
so he was found
by Officer Darrell.

35
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:04,950
- Officer Darrell? You are
seriously undoping this.

36
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:06,734
You got anything else
for me? Jen?

37
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:08,736
- The apartment was locked
from the inside.

38
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,172
- Mysterious. Dope.

39
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,696
- And the alarm system
was still armed.

40
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,132
- Dope, dope, dope, dope.
So hard to solve.

41
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:15,003
- Any surveillance cameras?
- Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:16,527
Tons of 'em. We checked 'em.
- It's too easy.

43
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,876
- But no one was seen
going in or out.

44
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,399
So whoever did this
was a ghost.

45
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:20,661
- Yes! A ghost!

46
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,622
Oh! I officially declare
this case... dope!

47
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,036
Whoo! I love the first
walkthrough of a crime scene.

48
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,690
It's kind of like arriving
at summer camp,

49
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,257
except the lake
is full of blood

50
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,606
and your bunk mate is dead.

51
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,303
I think I might be bad
at metaphors.

52
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,175
- So after Adams comes home
from work,

53
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,655
the only person
who even approaches

54
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,091
his doorway
is this delivery guy?

55
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:00,701
- Yeah, but he never enters
the apartment.

56
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,485
- Hey, Rosa. Check it out.
Triple digies!

57
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:04,879
There's so much evidence,
we hit triple digies.

58
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:06,707
- Cool.
- Cool indeed.

59
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,143
But you know what's not cool?

60
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:09,971
Our vic ordered his dinner
from House of Lettuce.

61
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:12,060
There's no way this guy knew
he was gonna die.

62
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,236
No one would want lettuce
as their last meal.

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,238
For example, my last meal...

64
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,240
is gon'st to be Sour Straws.

65
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:19,590
- You just keep those
in your pocket?

66
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:20,895
- We face death every day.

67
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,680
I gotta be prepared to go out
on my own terms.

68
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:24,029
- I can't even think
about eating.

69
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:26,031
Smells like the brim
of Scully's hat in here.

70
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:28,642
- That's the heat wave.
It sped up body decomp.

71
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:30,601
I guess you could say
this mystery

72
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:32,254
is straight outta decomp...

73
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:33,255
ton.

74
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,475
- No. Who are you?

75
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,607
- I'm Franco McCoy.

76
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,825
I'm running CSI and forensics.

77
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,435
You two must be detectives.

78
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,959
I can tell because you look
pretty buttoned up.

79
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:42,656
- We're both wearing
leather jackets.

80
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,875
And I won this hoodie
for eating a big pizza.

81
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:45,354
- Just do me a favor.

82
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:47,226
Don't turn into a star humper
around me or my squad,

83
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:49,010
because they make TV shows
about us sometimes.

84
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:50,664
- What? They make shows
about us all the time.

85
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,274
- Name one.
- "Law and Order."

86
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:53,624
- Never heard of it.
- "NYPD Blue."

87
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,755
- Nope.
- "Miami Vice."

88
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,887
- Nah.
- "Hill Street Blues."

89
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,192
- Pass.
- "The Wire."

90
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:58,411
- Sounds dumb.
- "Rizzoli & Isles."

91
00:02:58,454 --> 00:02:59,804
- Okay. That's a good one.

92
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,283
- All right, if the heat
is causing the smell,

93
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:02,763
why don't we just turn on
the air conditioning—

94
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,112
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That kind of air flow

95
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:05,723
is gonna kick up
all kinds of dust particles.

96
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,115
That AC stays off,
which means the odor in here?

97
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,813
Only gonna get worse.
Pro tip: plug your noses.

98
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,728
Had this little bad boy
custom-made 3-D printed

99
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:12,643
to fit these sweet nosters.

100
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,557
- Are you trying
to abbreviate "nostrils"?

101
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,734
- In CSI, we don't try.

102
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,954
We do, son.

103
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:23,175
- Okay. Well, it's been
sort of okay meeting you.

104
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:25,177
We're gonna turn our backs
and ignore you now.

105
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:29,050
- Hey, Jake.
You know what it's time for?

106
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,269
- I sure do.

107
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:32,053
both: Jake and Rosa's
first impressions.

108
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:33,664
- Cast-off pattern
on the far wall

109
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:34,969
suggests upward
knife slices. Jake?

110
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,188
- Wounds on the vic's back
means

111
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:37,798
he didn't see
the killer coming. Rosa?

112
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,365
- Laptop, wallet, keys
all in plain sight.

113
00:03:39,408 --> 00:03:40,583
No sign of forced entry.

114
00:03:40,627 --> 00:03:41,802
Doesn't connote
a robbery. Jake?

115
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,108
- But it does connote
that our killer

116
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,675
was waiting for Adams
in the apartment.

117
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:45,763
Did I just use the word
"connote" correctly?

118
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:46,764
- You did.
- Great.

119
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:48,287
Will you text that to Amy?

120
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,767
I don't want to say what using
good vocabulary gets me.

121
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,942
- Okay.
- Sexual intercourse.

122
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,334
- Gross.
- What? We're adults.

123
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:54,510
- I'm his mother!
Let me in!

124
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:55,816
- Rock-paper-scissors

125
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,513
for who has to talk
to the vic's mom.

126
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,124
- Deal.

127
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,473
It's a game of chance.
How do you always win?

128
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:01,953
- You always pick paper.

129
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:04,303
- That is not true.
Here, go again.

130
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:05,391
One more time.

131
00:04:05,434 --> 00:04:07,654
All right, one more time.

132
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:09,177
One more time.
One more time.

133
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,702
One more time.

134
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:13,225
All right, one more time.

135
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:14,705
One more time.

136
00:04:14,748 --> 00:04:16,881
God, this reverse psychology
is a bust!

137
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,752
Ma'am? I'm Detective Peralta.

138
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:20,711
This is Detective Diaz.

139
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:22,016
I'm so sorry for your loss.

140
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,539
- Please tell me
whatever you can.

141
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,845
Nobody will tell me anything.

142
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,151
- I really wish that I could,

143
00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:27,674
but we're just starting
our investigation.

144
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,632
Now, is there anyone
you can think of

145
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:31,069
that would want to hurt
your son?

146
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:32,723
- No! Everybody loved Andrew.

147
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:33,985
I don't know why this happened!

148
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:35,726
Please, you have to find
who did this.

149
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,162
- We're doing everything
we can.

150
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:39,294
- Promise me
you'll find who did this.

151
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:41,906
- Ma'am, we can't promise—
- Promise me!

152
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,821
Andrew was my whole world.

153
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:45,823
I'm a single mom.

154
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:49,783
- I promise you.
- Wow.

155
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:51,219
You really are an idiot.

156
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:52,220
- Um, exsqueeze me?

157
00:04:52,264 --> 00:04:53,874
- Did you really just promise

158
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,310
a victim's family member
we would solve a crime?

159
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:57,573
- Oh, come on.
I was just consoling her.

160
00:04:57,617 --> 00:05:00,054
- No. It was a full-on promise,
and it wasn't just her.

161
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,621
- Yes, Betty.

162
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:03,275
I promise I will find
your friend's son's killer.

163
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:04,885
Yes, you can put
your husband on.

164
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,408
I'll promise him too.

165
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:08,062
Okay, well, what's his number
at work, then?

166
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:09,585
Do you have a pen?

167
00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:10,978
- You broke the number one rule

168
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,893
of dealing with
a victim's family member.

169
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,112
What were you thinking?
- I don't know.

170
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:15,940
She reminded me
of my mom, okay?

171
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,419
A single mother
crying in the hallway?

172
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:19,160
Those are some of my best
childhood memories.

173
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:20,466
- Jake.
- What, is that bad?

174
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:21,815
- Dude, you never
make a promise,

175
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,295
because if we don't solve this,

176
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:24,949
you've given her false hope,
and that is way worse.

177
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,167
- Normally, I would totally
agree with you,

178
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:27,995
but we're going to solve
this case.

179
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:30,041
We have so much evidence.
We hit triple digies!

180
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:32,608
We'll interview his friends
and neighbors and coworkers.

181
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:34,262
Come on.
We got this!

182
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:35,786
We're Jake and Rosa!
- And also Franco.

183
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,135
- You're not a part
of this, Franco.

184
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:37,918
- Your loss.

185
00:05:40,616 --> 00:05:42,053
- My goodness.

186
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:43,837
Did Mother Gothel finally
let you out of the tower

187
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:45,447
to see the lanterns that fly
for your birthday?

188
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,232
- What?
- It was a "Tangled" burn.

189
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,842
Charles and I watched it
for bros night.

190
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:49,930
- Cool. No, Jocelyn's learning

191
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,105
how to weave in
hair extensions.

192
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:52,367
She wanted me to look nice

193
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,152
'cause I'm meeting
her parents tonight.

194
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,676
- Wow. Moving fast.
Meetin' each other's parents.

195
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,460
- Yeah. Well, I'm meeting hers.

196
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:00,158
I still haven't talked
to my mom since coming out,

197
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,769
so... it's kind of a bummer.

198
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:03,944
I don't really want to talk
about this.

199
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,467
Can we find a segue?

200
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,121
- What? You can't just say
"let's find a segue."

201
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:08,557
- I just did.
- Okay.

202
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,994
- I talked to the neighbors.

203
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,256
Our vic had a party
three nights before the murder.

204
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:12,735
I talked to everyone
on the guest list.

205
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:13,736
They all have alibis,
so I got nothing.

206
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,129
How did your interviews go?

207
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,304
- Not great. I talked
to his coworkers,

208
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:17,479
friends, and family.

209
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:18,654
No one had a motive.
Everyone loved him.

210
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,482
The dumb jerk. RIP.

211
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:21,919
- Did you promise any of them
that you'd find the killer?

212
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:23,790
Yes, his aunt.

213
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,052
She also reminded me of my mom.

214
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:26,532
Her name was Karen!

215
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,186
- Jake!
- Look, it's gonna be fine.

216
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,665
This apartment is full
of forensic evidence.

217
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,493
There is no way that CSI
hasn't found something.

218
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:33,365
I have never been more
confident in my entire—

219
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:34,975
I can taste
the smell.

220
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,977
Ugh. You shouldn't be able
to taste smells.

221
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,326
- That's the heat
cookin' the blood rot

222
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,024
right out of the floorboards.

223
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,678
Set scent to simmer.

224
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:43,897
Serve over rice.

225
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,725
- Well... I hated that.

226
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:47,292
- Just so you know, Franco,

227
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:48,902
we're not responding positively
to you as a person.

228
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:50,686
- Yeah. Maybe just give us
an update on the labs.

229
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,514
- Copy that. The victim
was stabbed 30 times.

230
00:06:52,558 --> 00:06:54,865
Coroner puts time of death
between 6:00 p.m.

231
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:56,518
and 7:30 p.m. Sunday night.

232
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:57,911
- Okay, and how many
DNA matches did you find?

233
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:59,086
- None.
- What about hair?

234
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,522
- Zero.
- Fingerprints?

235
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,350
- Zilcharoni. I have
no matches of anything

236
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:04,352
on any criminal databases
whatsoever.

237
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:06,006
- Still feeling good
about your promise, Jake?

238
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,921
- Still feeling good
about that haircut, Cousin It?

239
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,880
Franco, how did you guys
not find anything?

240
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,272
You had 15 people in here.

241
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,534
First of all,

242
00:07:12,578 --> 00:07:13,753
you sound so ignorant
right now.

243
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,102
I had 14 guys here.

244
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:16,364
Like I'd ever get approval
for 15 guys.

245
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:17,713
That's insane.

246
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:19,324
Second of all, don't worry,
Detective Kitty Cat.

247
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,065
I got one droplet of milk
nestled at the top

248
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,675
of CSI's teat, so pucker up.

249
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:24,198
- Just talk normal.

250
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:26,984
- We tested the blood.

251
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:29,725
This splatter here
belongs to the victim,

252
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,162
this to a second individual,

253
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:32,903
and that to a third.

254
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:34,078
- Oh, hells, yes.

255
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,296
We might have some perp blood
in here.

256
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,341
This is huge!

257
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:38,386
Rosa, we are gonna solve
this case.

258
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,040
- What're you doing?
- Texting my mom.

259
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,476
I mean, the vic's mom.

260
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,956
I know that it's bad
that I said "my mom."

261
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,436
- It's bad
that you're texting her.

262
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,351
- I know!

263
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:52,835
- Ah. Good morning, Rosa.

264
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,185
I see you're still going out
with Edward Scissorhands.

265
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:55,882
- You seem particularly chipper
this morning.

266
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,710
- Indeed I am,
because I finally tracked down

267
00:07:57,753 --> 00:07:59,190
the guy who delivered our vic
his final meal

268
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:00,713
and, in so doing,
maybe saw the other two guys

269
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:02,323
who bled all over
this apartment.

270
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:03,846
- We don't know there were
three people in this apartment.

271
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,936
- Peralta. Diaz.
Special delivery.

272
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:07,111
Delivery guy.

273
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,764
- Wow, Franco,
you're really getting lazy.

274
00:08:08,808 --> 00:08:10,810
- You're lazy.
- Even lazier.

275
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:12,725
Hello, sir. We'd like to ask
you a couple of questions.

276
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:14,031
- Okay, look, I ate
a couple fries out of the bag,

277
00:08:14,074 --> 00:08:15,554
but everybody does that.

278
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:17,295
- That's not why you're here.
- Oh, snap.

279
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:18,470
Is this about weed?

280
00:08:18,513 --> 00:08:20,254
- Should it be?
- No?

281
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:21,952
- You delivered food to the guy
in this apartment at 6:40 p.m.

282
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:24,215
on Sunday, and within the hour,
he was murdered.

283
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:26,043
- What? How?
That's horrible!

284
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:27,566
- Don't worry.

285
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:29,481
We're definitely gonna catch
the guy who did it, I promise.

286
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:30,786
- Stop promising people.
- Not.

287
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,266
- Did you see anything
suspicious?

288
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,746
- No. But I didn't go inside.

289
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,356
The guy came to the door.
I just gave him the food.

290
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,228
- And did you see or hear
anyone else in the apartment?

291
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:38,664
- No, just that one guy.

292
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:41,493
He ordered, uh, three
beetroot zucchini wraps.

293
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:42,798
- Three.
Three disgusting wraps.

294
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:43,974
Three disgusting bloodstains.
I knew it.

295
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:45,714
There were three people
in there.

296
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,020
- Will you be willing
to go inside and let us know

297
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:48,979
if anything looks different
to you?

298
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:50,806
- Yeah. Sure, that's fine.
I don't care.

299
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,895
Why would you
show this to me?

300
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:55,637
Oh, I'm too high to see this.
There's blood on the fish!

301
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,117
On the fish!

302
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,858
- I always forget
how weirdly numb

303
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,642
to horrific things we are.

304
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,035
Do you think it affects
our souls

305
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,515
and the relationships
we build with others?

306
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:04,864
- Oh, for sure.
- Oh.

307
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:05,996
- You must have seen something.

308
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,823
You delivered the food at 6:40,

309
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,477
and sometime before 7:30,
Adams was stabbed to death.

310
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:10,913
- Stop saying "stabbed"!

311
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,002
What I saw in there
forever changed me.

312
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:13,525
My heart is still pounding.

313
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:14,830
- Wait.

314
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:16,310
Adams was wearing
a smart watch, right?

315
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:17,485
Those things track
your heart rate.

316
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:18,921
If we look at his phone,
we can see

317
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:21,402
the exact moment that his heart
stopped beating.

318
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:24,188
Here we go. Activities app.

319
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,580
And... boom.

320
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:27,147
His heart rate dropped to zero
at exactly 6:03.

321
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,062
- The food wasn't even ordered
until 6:16, which means—

322
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:30,672
both: The killer ordered
the food!

323
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:32,674
- Oh, God.
Did I talk to a murderer?

324
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:34,154
- Jake, this guy saw the perp.

325
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,634
We have to get him in front
of a sketch artist.

326
00:09:35,677 --> 00:09:36,852
- Oh, yeah.
I'm feeling it now, Rosa.

327
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:38,724
At this time tomorrow,
we're gonna know

328
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,421
exactly what our killer
looks like.

329
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:42,597
- We have no idea
what our killer looks like.

330
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:43,946
- Well, that's not
totally true.

331
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,687
We now know that the killer
might look like

332
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:48,125
Seth Myers, Winona Ryder,
or Bilbo Baggins.

333
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:49,865
- The delivery guy
kept starting over.

334
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:52,520
Apparently, he's always high.
I'm sorry, man.

335
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:53,913
Our big break
turned into nothing.

336
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:55,219
- Detectives.
- Ah! Captain.

337
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,481
Did you come down here
to take a look

338
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:57,786
at the two best detectives

339
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,223
you've ever worked with
in action?

340
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,572
- The two best detectives
I've ever worked with

341
00:10:00,615 --> 00:10:01,964
are Montez and Dillman.

342
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:03,357
- Oh. You never
mentioned them before.

343
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,750
- They were excellent.

344
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:06,099
I'm here because Major Crimes
wants this case.

345
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:07,622
I was hoping to tell them
you have some leads.

346
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,190
I overheard you mention
a Bill Bo-Baggins.

347
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,626
Should we bring him in?

348
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,714
- Well, as much as I would
love to meet him,

349
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,064
he is not a suspect.

350
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:15,978
- Okay, so who is?
- At this time?

351
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:17,371
No one.

352
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:19,982
But... we are currently
investigating no leads.

353
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:21,375
- So you have nothing.
- Not nothing.

354
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,029
Jake made a new best friend.
The vic's mom.

355
00:10:23,073 --> 00:10:24,509
He promised her
he'd solve the case.

356
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:25,945
- That's a rookie mistake.
- Okay.

357
00:10:25,988 --> 00:10:28,339
Fine. So maybe I'm not
Montana and Dilbert.

358
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:29,905
- Montez and Dillman!

359
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:31,864
And they would've remembered
your name after one mention.

360
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:33,692
- Because we're memorable,
and they're not.

361
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:35,085
Turned it around.

362
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:36,564
- Nope.
- All right, look, Captain.

363
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:38,131
Rosa and I are gonna solve
this case.

364
00:10:38,175 --> 00:10:40,002
The answer is in this room.
We just have to focus

365
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:41,830
and let the room speak to us,
isn't that right, room?

366
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,136
- When you talk to the room,

367
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,703
I lose even more confidence
in you.

368
00:10:44,746 --> 00:10:46,226
- Why? Oh, wait, I see it.
All right.

369
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,010
Can you please just buy us
some more time anyway?

370
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:49,708
Sir, I feel like
we've earned this.

371
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,145
- Fine. Work fast.
- You got it.

372
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:53,929
Okay. Let's look at the scene
like we're seeing it

373
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:55,192
for the first time
with fresh eyes.

374
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:56,497
Vic was face down.

375
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,890
- Cast-off splatter suggests
upward knife slices.

376
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:59,109
- No signs of forced entry.

377
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:00,806
Laptop, wallet, keys
were all there.

378
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,155
both: Doesn't connote
a robbery.

379
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:03,678
- Wait a minute.
Have we said this already?

380
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:05,071
Are we just having the exact
same conversation?

381
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,551
- Yep.
- Cool. Moving on.

382
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:08,205
Windows and doors locked
from the inside.

383
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:09,684
Nobody in or out.

384
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:11,991
Think, think, think... oh!

385
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:13,906
The upstairs neighbor
and his best friend

386
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,777
drilled through the ceiling,
murdered Adams,

387
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:18,171
bleed all over the apartment,
then climbed back up

388
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,955
and sealed the hole
behind them!

389
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:21,522
- Negative, we would have found
construction debris

390
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,045
and microscopic paint fibers.

391
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,743
The only thing
that needs patching...

392
00:11:24,786 --> 00:11:27,311
is that theory.

393
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,834
- Okay. New idea.

394
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:30,183
We're gonna get inside
the mind of the killer.

395
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:32,751
We eat the veggie wraps.

396
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:34,492
Here we go.

397
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:36,711
Oh, this sick bastard.

398
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:39,453
Oh, man.
This is one twisted mother.

399
00:11:39,497 --> 00:11:41,107
Oh, the beets are raw.

400
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,978
This guy is demented, Rosa!

401
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:44,502
Okay. All we have to do
is figure out

402
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:46,156
what kind of person can walk
by cameras without being seen.

403
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:47,635
Someone camouflaged as a wall.
- Unlikely.

404
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,941
- Harry Potter
and his invisibility cloak.

405
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:50,247
- Not a real person.
- Babadook.

406
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,204
- Doesn't exist.

407
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:52,466
- What about
a Looper situation?

408
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,815
- It's not a Looper situation.

409
00:11:53,859 --> 00:11:54,903
- It could totally be
a Looper situation!

410
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,035
- It's not a Looper situation.

411
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:57,123
- This is my
least favorite hair!

412
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,864
Oh, my God, Rosa, come here.

413
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:00,996
Look at the blood spatter.

414
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,955
Do you see what I see?
- Uh, blood.

415
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:05,218
- In the exact shape
of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

416
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:08,830
Pec, pec, delt, delt.
Big Samoan tattoo.

417
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:10,919
Rosa. I think I just made
a connection.

418
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,052
The number three is everywhere.

419
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:14,923
Three people.
Three types of blood.

420
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,492
And guess what the tax was
on the veggie wraps?

421
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:20,102
Three dollars.

422
00:12:20,146 --> 00:12:24,019
And 19¢, but if you ignore
the 19, then it's three!

423
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:25,499
- Okay. You've lost your mind.
- What? Who told you that?

424
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:26,848
Was it room?

425
00:12:26,892 --> 00:12:28,546
- No. It's the fact
that you think

426
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:30,243
the room has a voice and also
you're working in your boxers!

427
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:33,028
- To beat the heat, Rosa!
To beat the heat!

428
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:34,204
If we can't turn on the AC,

429
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:35,683
that's not crazy,
it's just smart.

430
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:37,729
- Jake. I gave the case
to Major Crimes.

431
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:40,210
- What? You can't do that.
I promised Luan!

432
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:41,733
- Yeah, and now
you can't let it go.

433
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,735
The scene's yours, guys.

434
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:45,563
I'm sorry, Jake.
It's over.

435
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,695
- Okay, Rosa, fine!
I'll leave.

436
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:48,957
Come on, room!

437
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:53,223
- You left your pants.
- I don't care!

438
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,186
- Hey, Jake.
- Ah!

439
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,492
Hello, Rosa,
my coworker and friend.

440
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:02,797
- Look, I know you're mad
at me,

441
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:04,146
but I only gave away that case
to help you.

442
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,583
You were acting like a lunatic.

443
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,019
- Don't even worry about it.
You were totally right.

444
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:08,673
I was in way too deep,
and honestly,

445
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:10,327
I feel so free
not having to work

446
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,024
that case anymore,
so thank you.

447
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:15,027
- Cool, you're welcome.
What's up with all the ketchup?

448
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,202
- Thank you for asking, Rosa.

449
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:17,638
It's for my hot dog.

450
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:19,118
Anyways, this has been
a great chat,

451
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,902
but I better get back
to my hot dog.

452
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:26,212
- Oh, wow.
- Ah! Hey!

453
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:27,518
Rosa, guess what?

454
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:29,084
There was no hot dog.

455
00:13:29,128 --> 00:13:30,521
Who's the lunatic now?

456
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:31,957
- Still you, Jake.
- Yeah, right!

457
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,698
There's nothing crazy
about this, sister.

458
00:13:33,741 --> 00:13:36,527
It's the crime scene:
stove, kitchen island,

459
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,355
blood, and of course, the body.

460
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:39,747
Hi, Rosa.

461
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,618
I'm the body.

462
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:42,097
- Shh. Stay in character!

463
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:44,230
- Roger that.
- Let's get that blood on you.

464
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:45,753
You gave away my case,
but guess what?

465
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:47,146
I spent two months
in that apartment.

466
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:48,539
I can recreate it in my sleep.

467
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:50,236
- Have you slept?
- No.

468
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,759
- What the hell is going on
in here?

469
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,370
- Jake's gone insane
because he promised

470
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,067
the victim's mom
he'd solve her son's murder.

471
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,460
- Seriously?

472
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,375
You never promise
a victim's relative anything.

473
00:13:58,418 --> 00:14:00,115
- Oh, please.
Classic Terry.

474
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,987
Mr. Emotionless.
Sgt. Cold Heart.

475
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,249
The man who bleeds ice.

476
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:04,468
- I don't think
that rings true.

477
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,773
- No?
- Clean it up and get out.

478
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:06,818
You've lost your mind.

479
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:07,993
- What? That's not true!

480
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,342
Charles, tell him.

481
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:10,996
- Well, actually,
he does have a point.

482
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,563
- Really?
Oh, man, wow.

483
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:14,739
I guess it really does take
your closest friends

484
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:16,958
to make you realize
that you have crap friends

485
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:20,527
that are idiots
and are dumb and idiots!

486
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:22,964
I'm solving this.

487
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:24,357
- Hey, we heard
there's a hot dog in here.

488
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,924
- No. Jake lied for no reason.

489
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,752
- That son of a bitch!

490
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:32,757
- Oh, hey, babe.

491
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,107
- Ugh!
It's me, Jake!

492
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,283
I'm just working!
What is wrong with you?

493
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:38,632
- What are you doing?
Why do you have a knife?

494
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,504
Why am I covered
in red Post-its?

495
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,419
- That's blood.
You're the corpse.

496
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:43,898
Jake, who is that?

497
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:45,204
- Franco McCoy. CSI.

498
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,510
- He's helping me
with the case.

499
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,511
- For the record,
I think it's weird

500
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,512
that I'm here too.

501
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,904
- Both of you, get out!

502
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:50,905
- Yeah, sounds good.

503
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:51,906
- Sorry to wake you.

504
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,951
Sweet dreams.

505
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:54,561
- Come on.

506
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,564
Okay, so, no one went in,
no one came out.

507
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,131
The lab confirmed
that the surveillance footage

508
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:01,002
wasn't tampered with.

509
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:03,701
So what happened in there,
Olive Rosa?

510
00:15:03,744 --> 00:15:05,442
- I don't know.
- Ah! You can talk.

511
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:06,617
Oh. Rosa.

512
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,227
It's just you.

513
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,316
I thought I was really going
crazy for a second there.

514
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,144
It was just person Rosa.

515
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:13,711
- You look like crap.

516
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,277
- You look like a freshman
at an all-women's college.

517
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,409
- I don't think you're in
a position

518
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:17,541
to be offering criticism
right now.

519
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,499
- More than fair.

520
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,066
- I'm worried about you, man.

521
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:22,894
- Yeah. I can't figure it out.

522
00:15:22,937 --> 00:15:24,548
- Then you gotta let it go.
- I can't do that either.

523
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,245
- Look, I know you want
to help this woman,

524
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:27,507
but there are other cases.

525
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,856
There are other people
that need your help,

526
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,642
and right now,
you're not helping anyone.

527
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:32,947
You gotta tell her it's over.

528
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:35,341
- I don't know
if I can do that.

529
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:36,821
- Then I'll go with you.

530
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:39,345
I forced you to be there
when I came out to my parents.

531
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,304
I owe you.

532
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,655
- All right.

533
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:46,526
We've exhausted every lead,

534
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,789
We have checked every alibi,

535
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,009
and we have followed
every last piece of forensics,

536
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:54,404
so I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

537
00:15:57,232 --> 00:16:01,585
I can't find your son's killer.

538
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:02,803
- I understand.

539
00:16:02,847 --> 00:16:04,631
Thank you for trying
as hard as you did.

540
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:06,198
I really hoped you'd find him.

541
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,200
- Well, don't lose hope,
because Major Crimes

542
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:10,463
is on the case as we speak,
and they're very—

543
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:11,856
- Oh, they already
contacted me.

544
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,249
Because it's been so long
without any new leads,

545
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:16,469
they've labeled it a cold case.

546
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:19,211
They said I shouldn't
hold out hope.

547
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:20,995
I'm sorry.

548
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,650
It's not you.

549
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:25,609
I just can't stop
feeling guilty.

550
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,307
Andrew and I were not
on the best of terms.

551
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,700
We had this huge fight,

552
00:16:29,743 --> 00:16:32,703
and we hadn't spoken
in almost a year.

553
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:35,923
I just wish I could've made it
right when I had the chance.

554
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:38,099
- I'm very sorry to hear that,
but I'm sure—

555
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,492
- We're gonna find
your son's killer.

556
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:40,841
- What?

557
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:42,713
- Jake and I are jumping back
on the case.

558
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:44,845
We'll make sure your son
gets the justice he deserves.

559
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:46,456
I promise.

560
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:47,500
- Thank you.

561
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:55,508
- Rosa?

562
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:58,206
- She just reminds me
of my mom.

563
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,512
- Oh, boy.

564
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,866
- So, we gonna talk about
what happened back there?

565
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,477
I haven't seen someone cry
that much

566
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,087
since Charles heard they were
remaking "First Wives Club."

567
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,480
- It sort of bothers me
that my mom

568
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:11,698
hasn't talked to me
since I came out.

569
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,004
- Why don't you just give her
a call?

570
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:14,048
- Because I shouldn't have to.

571
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:15,528
It's her issue, not mine.

572
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,312
I mean, I'm glad I came out
to her, it's just,

573
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:18,792
it's taking her way longer
to come around

574
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:19,793
than I thought it would.

575
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,534
It sucks.

576
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:23,362
That's weird.
The police tape's already gone.

577
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:25,016
- Oh, yeah, Major Crimes
released the scene yesterday.

578
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:26,452
But I'm sure
they haven't had time

579
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,628
to clean up the evidence...

580
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,152
- Oh, man, they emptied
the place out.

581
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:32,371
Nothing left in here.

582
00:17:32,414 --> 00:17:34,155
I can't believe
this is how it ends.

583
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:36,070
- Yeah. Is it weird
that I miss the smell?

584
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,639
Wait a minute,
do you hear that?

585
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,336
I've spent 600 hours
in this room,

586
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,555
and I have never heard
that sound.

587
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,774
- It's because
the air conditioning's

588
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:44,992
never been turned on.

589
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:46,777
It's coming from that vent.

590
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,216
- I don't see anything.

591
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:54,567
Wait, there's a bend.

592
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:56,569
Oh, my God.

593
00:17:56,613 --> 00:18:00,007
There's food and water in here!

594
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:01,835
Rosa. We never saw the killer
leave this apartment

595
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:03,402
because he never left.

596
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:04,795
- But he couldn't have survived
in there for months.

597
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:05,970
That's insane.

598
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:07,319
- He wasn't back there
for months.

599
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:08,581
He just waited for the body
to be discovered

600
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,148
and then snuck out
sometime after that.

601
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,323
- But this place was crawling
with cops.

602
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:12,454
- Which is exactly
what he wanted.

603
00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:13,543
He snuck out
dressed like a cop.

604
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:14,805
- Even if he had a uniform,

605
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:16,589
somebody would've
recognized him.

606
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:17,938
- Not if his face was covered.
- By a hazmat suit.

607
00:18:17,982 --> 00:18:19,461
The CSI guys!

608
00:18:19,505 --> 00:18:20,680
Franco said he had 14 techs,
but didn't you count 15?

609
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,726
- I did count 15!
My math was right!

610
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,249
Suck it, Mrs. Skanga!

611
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:25,598
She was my Algebra II teacher.

612
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:27,339
She threw a protractor
at my head.

613
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:28,775
- She sucks.
- She sucked!

614
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:30,429
Actually, she was very sweet.
She believed in me.

615
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:32,300
- Oh.
- Yeah.

616
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,954
- Here's the security footage.

617
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:36,304
It's rated G for Gonna Get Got.

618
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,916
- Less is more, Franco.
Play the tape.

619
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,005
- Okay, so there's us arriving.

620
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:42,354
Oh, man, is that how I walk?

621
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:43,790
- Yes.
- Should I change how I walk?

622
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,487
- Yes.
- All right. Wait. Go back.

623
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:46,967
- Jake, we don't have time
to fix your walk.

624
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,534
It's gonna take a lot of work,
and we're very busy.

625
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:50,144
- No. Look.
Look at this guy.

626
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:52,799
All the other techs are wearing
booties, but he's not.

627
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:54,366
- Follow that guy.

628
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:59,327
Where's the footage from
the bodega across the street?

629
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,156
- We have that?
That is so crazy.

630
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,854
We are under surveillance
at all times.

631
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:05,812
I'm sure it's fine and it won't
backfire and ruin society.

632
00:19:05,856 --> 00:19:07,814
Zoom in on his face.

633
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,642
- That man's not CSI.

634
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:10,512
- No, Franco.

635
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,993
But he is about to say...

636
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:14,604
CS-Bye.

637
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:17,171
Yeah-ow!

638
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:19,347
- Respect, Jake.
Respect.

639
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:23,482
- Okay, Rosa.

640
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:24,831
You know what it's time for.
- I do.

641
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,311
both: Jake and Rosa's
final impressions.

642
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:27,355
- Your client's a hit man.

643
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,748
He snuck into the apartment

644
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,010
during a party
several nights earlier,

645
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:31,272
hid in the vent for three days,

646
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,057
then emerged
and murdered Adams. Jake?

647
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,667
- He then spilled bags of blood

648
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:36,277
that he stole from a blood bank
all over the floor

649
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:37,844
and turned on
the victim's vacuum cleaner

650
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:39,846
to make the crime scene
as messy as possible. Rosa?

651
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,631
- The messy scene meant
there'd be extra crime techs,

652
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,458
allowing your client
to sneak out in a hazmat suit,

653
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:44,851
which records show
he bought online.

654
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:46,418
- Two weeks before the crime
was committed.

655
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,028
My only question is,

656
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:49,203
who was behind all this?

657
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:50,944
- I was hired
by a chicken farmer.

658
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:52,293
- Okay. Dopeness taking
a late hit here,

659
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:53,817
but we still got you.

660
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,558
See you at the sentencing,
peace, and we're out.

661
00:19:56,602 --> 00:19:57,690
- He's pleading guilty.

662
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:58,996
- Oh, thank God.

663
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,562
But why did he kill Andrew?

664
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:02,129
Was he doing something bad?

665
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:03,391
- Not at all.

666
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,566
He was about to publish
an exposé

667
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,916
on a large-scale poultry farm

668
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:07,961
whose owner was bribing
an FDA regulator.

669
00:20:08,005 --> 00:20:09,528
He put a hit out on your son.

670
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:10,964
- Well, is anybody
going after him?

671
00:20:11,008 --> 00:20:13,314
- If they're not, then I will.
I promise you.

672
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,840
- Come here.
- Oh.

673
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:19,581
- Why are
you promising her?

674
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,583
- I can't
help myself!

675
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,411
- Good-bye, detectives.

676
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,849
- Take care.

677
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,764
I gotta say, we would not
have solved that case

678
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,591
if you hadn't gotten involved
emotionally.

679
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:31,724
Think we'd be better cops
if we did that all the time?

680
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:33,030
- Absolutely not, never again.

681
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:34,248
- Yeah, it was
a total nightmare.

682
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:35,728
You want to get
a celebratory drink?

683
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,251
- I would, but I'm actually
meeting somebody.

684
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:38,557
- Is it Jocelyn?
Do I get to meet Jocelyn?

685
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,601
Oh, God, is she gonna try
and cut my hair?

686
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:40,951
- No. It's my mom.

687
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:42,300
I waited too long
for her to come around

688
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:43,344
and call me, so I called her.

689
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:45,259
- That is so great.

690
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:46,826
Oh, no.
Is she meeting you here?

691
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,262
Am I about to get caught
in the middle

692
00:20:48,306 --> 00:20:49,611
of all your weird awkwardness
again?

693
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:52,614
- Hello, Jake.
- Ah! Hello, Mrs. Diaz!

694
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:56,314
America's favorite mother!

695
00:20:59,317 --> 00:21:00,797
- So?

696
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,102
- So.

697
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:03,713
- So...

698
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:04,496
Rosa's bi.

699
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:05,802
- Yes, Jake, I remember.

700
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:07,455
- Cool. Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool...

701
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,544
- You don't have to stay, man.
- Great. Thanks.

702
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,243
- It's really good to see you,
Rosalita.

703
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:16,029
- It's good to see you too.

704
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:17,901
- What did you do to your hair?
- Mom!

705
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,293
- No, no, no,
it's very cute, mija.

706
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:22,427
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

707
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,690
- Fremulon.
