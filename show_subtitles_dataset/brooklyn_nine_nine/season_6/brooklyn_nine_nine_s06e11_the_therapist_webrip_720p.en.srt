1
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:08,365
- Bottles.

2
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,454
Boyle.
Bullpen.

3
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:11,542
- What are you—
- Buh-buh-buh.

4
00:00:11,586 --> 00:00:13,979
Bottles, Boyle, bullpen.

5
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:14,763
Bowling.

6
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,895
Behold, Brooklyn buddies,

7
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:18,854
Boyle bullpen bottle bowling.

8
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,943
- Beautiful.
- Be brave, bro.

9
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:21,987
Be brave.

10
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,249
Bowl!

11
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:30,953
- Bam!
- Bull's-eye!

12
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:31,954
- Booyah!

13
00:00:31,997 --> 00:00:35,479
- Babushka!

14
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:40,092
all: Babushka!

15
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:01,592
- Jakey, I've got a hot case
for you.

16
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:02,811
- Ooh, hit me.

17
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,856
- Okay, Susan Buckley
was reported missing

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,468
by her psychiatrist,
Dr. William Tate.

19
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,165
He thinks
that her husband James

20
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,514
may have had a mental break

21
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:11,733
and done something terrible
to her.

22
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,212
- Ooh, that is a hot case.

23
00:01:13,256 --> 00:01:15,606
Missing woman, psycho husband,
creepy shrink.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,999
- Dr. Tate was actually
quite a nice man.

25
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:18,740
- Yeah, but you know,
he's a psychiatrist,

26
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:20,785
so he's automatically a creep.
I've seen movies.

27
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:22,221
They all turn into
super sophisticated,

28
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:23,614
Chianti-loving cannibals.

29
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:25,050
- Wait, have you never been
to therapy?

30
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,574
- No. Don't need it.
- Not even after the time

31
00:01:26,617 --> 00:01:28,053
your wife shot you?
- Nope.

32
00:01:28,097 --> 00:01:29,533
- What about when you were held
at gunpoint

33
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:30,969
and had to write
your own suicide note?

34
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:32,754
- Oh, that was crazy.
I forgot about that.

35
00:01:32,797 --> 00:01:34,190
- Or when you were falsely
accused of bank robbery

36
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:35,713
and went to prison?
- Was that a big deal?

37
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:37,106
- You joined a gang
and tried meth!

38
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:38,716
- I didn't want to be
anyone's bitch.

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,501
Look, it sounds like
these things affected you

40
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:41,850
more than they affected me.
Maybe you should go to therapy.

41
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,547
- I do.
Terry needs a safe space

42
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,157
to process his emotions.

43
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:47,508
- I go twice a week.
Couples counseling with my dad,

44
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,335
and then a solo sesh
with Dr. Tyler.

45
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:52,687
- Okay, unlike Kooky Charles
and Tearful Terry,

46
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,297
I am healthy
and don't need therapy.

47
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,342
- I hear that.
I don't go to therapy either.

48
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:58,910
Jake and I are like
two penises in a pod.

49
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:00,521
- Damn it, Hitchcock,
we talked about this.

50
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:01,913
It never helps
when you back me up.

51
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:04,394
Let's just go, Charles.

52
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:06,004
- Come in, Diaz.

53
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:08,485
- How'd you know it was me?
- The restrained knock.

54
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,660
Everyone else in this office

55
00:02:09,704 --> 00:02:11,183
plays my door
like it's a marimba.

56
00:02:11,227 --> 00:02:13,577
The other day,
Jeffords gave it three taps

57
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:15,448
and two raps.
- Was he drunk?

58
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:16,885
- One can only assume.
- Mm.

59
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,800
- Anyway, I wanted to invite
you and Jocelyn

60
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:20,453
to dinner at my house
this weekend.

61
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:23,239
Kevin will be making
his famous rice.

62
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:24,545
- Thank you for the invite,
but I'm not really

63
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:25,763
having people meet Jocelyn yet.

64
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:27,330
I'm still feeling things out
with her.

65
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:29,854
- But Boyle says you brought
Jocelyn to Shaw's last week.

66
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:32,117
- That was unplanned.
- Sure, but now that the squad

67
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:33,858
has all met her,
surely you can't object

68
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:35,338
to her having some rice
with Kevin and me?

69
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,689
- Okay, it's just that
you can be a bit... judgmental.

70
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:40,038
- What a stupid thing to say.

71
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:41,779
Name one time
when I have been judgmental.

72
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:43,607
- Okay.
- What a stupid thing to say.

73
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,740
Oh, I see.
Mere seconds ago.

74
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:47,350
- Sir, Jocelyn is not like us.

75
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:48,699
She has feelings.
- Huh.

76
00:02:48,743 --> 00:02:50,527
Are you positive
this is the woman for you?

77
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:51,746
- That is exactly
the type of thing

78
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,530
I don't want you to say
in front of her.

79
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:56,272
Sorry.
It's not gonna happen.

80
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:00,755
- Kevin, they're not coming.

81
00:03:00,798 --> 00:03:03,148
Yes, I know you've already
started soaking the rice.

82
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:05,890
Couldn't we just eat it
ourselves?

83
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:09,633
I understand you purchased
four portions of rice.

84
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:12,723
Yes, that's a great idea.

85
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:14,986
We'll eat the extra rice
for breakfast.

86
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,337
I love you, as well.

87
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,339
- Hey, Sarge,
a package was delivered

88
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:23,168
to my desk downstairs,
addressed to the 99th Precinct,

89
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:26,084
attention: Sergeant,
but it's not for me.

90
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:27,129
It's a book.

91
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,347
- Sounds like something
you'd order.

92
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,914
- "How to Please Your Wife:

93
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:32,613
100 Tips to Take Your Sex Life
from Blah to Ahhhh."

94
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:34,397
- Yeah.
That's not mine.

95
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,705
- It also shipped with
two gallons of protein powder.

96
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:40,142
- Well, I get my protein
from real food.

97
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:43,058
22 meals a day,
1 every 40 minutes.

98
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,800
- It's not a big deal, okay?
Just take the book.

99
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:47,453
I promise I won't tell anyone.

100
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:50,413
- Hey, Sarge,
I heard you need some sex tips.

101
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:52,241
- Except for the people
I already told.

102
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:54,678
- Here's the big one:
just lie flat on your back.

103
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:56,941
Women love to do all the work.
- Ugh.

104
00:03:56,985 --> 00:04:00,162
- That's very incorrect,
and I don't need sex tips!

105
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,207
- Okay, we'll just
leave the book here,

106
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:05,254
and whoever did order it can
take it when nobody's looking.

107
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,298
- It's not mine!

108
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:08,474
Terry doesn't order books
online.

109
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:10,476
He supports local bookstores.

110
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,043
They're dying, Amy!

111
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:14,480
- Oh, that guy looks like
he's wearing a skin mask

112
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:16,700
over his own face,
so I'm guessing it's Dr. Tate.

113
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:18,093
- He has a normal man's face,
Jake.

114
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:20,008
- Yes, he does have
a normal man's face,

115
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,662
stretched out
over his own face,

116
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:22,793
because he is a Hannibal.

117
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:24,839
Hi there.
Dr. Tate, I presume.

118
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,231
- Yes. Hi, nice to meet you.

119
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,842
Uh, which one of you is
in charge?

120
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:29,713
- Let the mind games begin.
- Excuse me?

121
00:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,236
- Sorry,
I am Detective Peralta.

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,151
This is Detective Boyle.
He's in charge.

123
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:35,327
- Dr. Tate, have you heard
anything from Mrs. Buckley?

124
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:37,416
- No, I haven't,
and I'm quite worried.

125
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,766
I received a frantic,

126
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:41,116
disturbing call
from James yesterday.

127
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,292
He was afraid
he'd done something horrible.

128
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:44,902
I asked him where he was,

129
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:47,339
and he said he was in the park
near the Zen garden.

130
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:50,168
I suspected he was just
experiencing delusions,

131
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:52,388
but when they didn't show up
for therapy today,

132
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:53,432
I became very concerned.

133
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:54,651
- So you think he killed her

134
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:55,870
and dumped her body
in the park?

135
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:57,088
- Sounds like
couples counseling

136
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,655
is going really great
for them.

137
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,701
- Sorry, my partner
doesn't believe in therapy.

138
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:02,746
- Oh, that's fine.
It's hard for some people.

139
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,487
- Title of your sex tape.

140
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,577
- Are you normally so cavalier
around murder investigations?

141
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,449
- Yes, we see a lot of darkness
in our line of work,

142
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:12,408
and humor is one
of our coping mechanisms.

143
00:05:12,451 --> 00:05:14,279
It's self-preservation
through disassociation.

144
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:15,324
- What the?

145
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:16,499
- It's something
I've been working on

146
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,414
with my therapist.

147
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:20,068
- Well, I act like this

148
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,723
because I'm cool and fun and
people like being around me.

149
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:24,725
- I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to trigger you.

150
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:25,813
- Okay, Doc,
you're not in your office.

151
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:27,031
You don't have to use words

152
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,467
like "triggered"
or "in denial."

153
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,818
- I didn't say "in denial."
Are you in denial?

154
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:33,342
- No, I am not,
and before you say anything,

155
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:35,126
I don't want to sleep
with my mom either.

156
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,954
- Now, why would you
bring that up unprompted?

157
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:38,216
- What? You prompted it.

158
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,783
- Jake, there's a body
over here.

159
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:41,002
- Oh, thank God.

160
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,568
I mean, "Oh, no, death."

161
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:45,267
I mean—I don't want to sleep
with my mom, okay?

162
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,445
- I know this is the wrong
takeaway from this case board,

163
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:50,751
but I really love the new yarn
you're using.

164
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,013
- There are sparkles in it.
- I noticed.

165
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:53,405
- Okay, so let's go over
what we got.

166
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,756
No witnesses, no weapon.
Bruising indicates a struggle.

167
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,540
- No conclusive DNA found
at the scene

168
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,063
other than from the three of us
who found the body.

169
00:05:59,107 --> 00:06:01,587
- And our chief suspect,
James Buckley, has disappeared.

170
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,372
- But he has no motive,
no criminal record,

171
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:04,765
and according
to his credit card statement,

172
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,592
had just purchased
two sombreros.

173
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:07,768
Kind of weird
to give someone a sombrero

174
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,421
when you're about to
murder them.

175
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:10,901
- Well, both sombreros
could have been for him.

176
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,424
It's always good
to have a backup sombrero.

177
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:13,556
- Please stop pronouncing it
like that.

178
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:14,731
- What, pronouncing sombreros

179
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,298
like sombrero?
- Yes.

180
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:17,342
Fine, if you want me

181
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:18,561
to pronounce it the wrong way.

182
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:20,302
Look, I think James
is a good suspect.

183
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:21,782
We have Dr. Tate's notebooks,

184
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:23,566
and they specifically mention
that he's been having

185
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:25,220
violent fantasies
for the last few months.

186
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:27,570
- And you want us to just
blindly trust Dr. Tate?

187
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:29,572
He's a creepy therapist.
They all are.

188
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,487
What kind of profession
requires a couch?

189
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,358
- Lots of them.
My cousin Pam has a couch

190
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:35,404
in his bird store.
Would you call that creepy?

191
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:37,449
- Yes!
Decidedly so.

192
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:39,190
- You always get upset
when I bring up Pam.

193
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:41,671
- Whatever. Can we please just
go check out James' apartment?

194
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:42,803
- Mm-hmm.

195
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,591
- Hello, gentlemen.
How is your day going?

196
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,854
- Great. I just woke up
from my morning nap.

197
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:53,030
I mean, my...
morning nap.

198
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:55,859
- It's fine.
It's good to be rested at work.

199
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:59,123
- Okay. Are you trying to prove
that you can be nonjudgmental?

200
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,690
- Rosa, I didn't see you there.

201
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:03,736
I was just having a friendly
chat with my employees.

202
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,043
So, uh, boys, tell me, what are
you doing this weekend?

203
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:09,264
- Well, we're going to a sauce
launch party at Wing Slutz.

204
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:11,570
- Sounds like a neat
cultural event.

205
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:13,442
- They're introducing
a new dairy-based sauce

206
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:15,879
called Cream Dream.

207
00:07:15,923 --> 00:07:17,141
- Mmm.

208
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:18,926
- And everyone who comes
gets a free bucket.

209
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:20,275
You want to know
what that's called?

210
00:07:20,318 --> 00:07:21,711
- Of course I do.
- No, you don't.

211
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:23,408
None of us do.
You proved your point.

212
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:25,236
If you want to meet Jocelyn
so bad, you can.

213
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,542
You win.

214
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:27,717
- Okay, well,
that's Friday night.

215
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,414
Now, every Saturday morning,

216
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:30,676
we go to the public baths.

217
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,330
- I get it.
You lead colorful lives.

218
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:34,202
Let's end this, shall we?

219
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,508
- Okay, so the neighbors say
they haven't seen or heard

220
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,641
any activity in
the Buckleys' apartment, and...

221
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:39,947
What is he doing here?

222
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,644
- If we find James
and he's unstable,

223
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:42,950
Dr. Tate could talk him down.

224
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:44,342
- Hello, Peralta.
- Plus, on the ride over,

225
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,866
he gave me a quickie.
- A what?

226
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,606
- A quick therapy session.
We talked about so much.

227
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,912
Did you know
that I have a tendency

228
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,653
to be unconsciously sexual?
- Yes.

229
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:51,654
- It's a real tough nut
to bust.

230
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:53,134
- Oh, you're doing it again.

231
00:07:53,177 --> 00:07:54,613
- Oh, okay, I think I hear it.

232
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:55,963
- You think you hear it?
- Mm-hmm.

233
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:58,052
- Whatever,
let's just do this, okay?

234
00:07:58,095 --> 00:07:59,749
NYPD, open up.

235
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,883
That's weird.

236
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,493
The door's unlocked.
- That's too bad.

237
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:05,755
I love watching you
pound one out.

238
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:07,496
- Charles.
- What? That was sexual?

239
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,801
Which part?
- All of the parts!

240
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:10,151
All right, you stay here.

241
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:11,152
Charles, we're going in.

242
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:17,854
Bedroom's clear.
- The kitchen's clear.

243
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,160
Did you see anything
suspicious?

244
00:08:19,203 --> 00:08:20,422
- Nothing, except for these

245
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:22,859
laughing Jesus paintings
everywhere.

246
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,687
Why is he in front of a tepee?
- I don't know.

247
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,645
The one in the kitchen has him
at the last supper,

248
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,604
but all the apostles
are McDonald's characters.

249
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,084
- Which one's Judas?
both: The Hamburglar.

250
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,955
- Knew it as soon as I asked.
You check the bathroom?

251
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,565
- No, where is it?
- It's right over there.

252
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:37,613
- Clear.
- Cool.

253
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:38,875
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Well, Dr. Tate,

254
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,616
we will meet you
back at the car.

255
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,835
We just want to check some
things out for one more minute.

256
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,315
Did you notice that?
- The painting in the bathroom

257
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:45,708
of Jesus standing over a vent

258
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,144
with his robe blowing up
like Marilyn Monroe?

259
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:49,799
- No.
Dr. Tate is the killer.

260
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:51,366
- Hey, Santiago.
- Hey.

261
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,890
- Can you help me put up
these flyers around the office?

262
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,370
- Mm-hmm.

263
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,067
"Lost sex book.
Delivered by accident

264
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,374
to Sergeant Jeffords,
who doesn't need it."

265
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:00,505
Terry, come on.

266
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:02,029
Nobody cares
about your sex life.

267
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:03,204
Just take the book home.

268
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,730
Take someone else's book home?

269
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:09,775
That's stealing and mail fraud.

270
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:12,039
I can't believe
you would even suggest that.

271
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,344
- Look, I think it's so great

272
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:14,389
that you've been married
so long

273
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,043
and want to keep it fresh.

274
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:18,828
I hope Jake does that for me if
our sex life ever takes a dip.

275
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,656
- Dip?
Oh, there is no dip.

276
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:22,875
Just ask Sharon.
- Oh, no, please.

277
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,703
I don't want to do that.
That's not necessary.

278
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:27,184
It's okay. I believe you.
- Hey, hon.

279
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:30,274
Yeah, could you tell Amy
how good I am in bed?

280
00:09:30,318 --> 00:09:32,015
Because I'm a sex machine who—

281
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,322
oh, on speaker?

282
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,368
Oh, hey, girls.
How was school?

283
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,935
- Why do you think
Dr. Tate's the murderer?

284
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,284
- He already knew
where the bathroom was.

285
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:41,807
He's clearly been here before.

286
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:44,114
- Well, he probably just
guessed, because it's obvious.

287
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:45,550
- This is New York.

288
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:46,899
It's never obvious
where the bathroom is.

289
00:09:46,943 --> 00:09:48,423
I once had an apartment
where the toilet

290
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:49,772
was literally
in the refrigerator.

291
00:09:49,815 --> 00:09:51,817
I bet he was sleeping
with Susan.

292
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,645
Therapists are always having
affairs with their patients.

293
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,082
- That's not true.
- Oh, really?

294
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,822
Tell that to the ten minutes
of "Bikini Shrink"

295
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:58,911
I watched on Cinemax
when I was 13.

296
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,609
Dr. Juggs was insatiable.

297
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:02,654
- James was ill.
We have months of notes

298
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:04,091
saying he was
increasingly unstable.

299
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,049
- First of all,
people with mental illness

300
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:07,833
are much more likely to be the
victims than the perpetrators.

301
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:09,618
I heard that on NPR
when I was in the room

302
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:11,098
while Amy was listening to NPR.
- Ah.

303
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,796
- And second, I bet
Dr. Tate's notes are fake.

304
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,015
I mean, you know what was
in Dr. Juggs' notes?

305
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,886
- What?
- Stick figures doing it.

306
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,280
- What does that prove?
- I don't know, but it was hot.

307
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,456
All I'm saying is, something
feels suspicious to me here.

308
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:22,935
Maybe we should go
to Dr. Tate's office

309
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,415
and see if we can find
the missing notebooks.

310
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:25,590
- Wait, you're basing this
all on the fact

311
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:27,288
that he knew
where a bathroom was?

312
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:29,507
- And his DNA was at the scene
where we discovered the body.

313
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:30,900
I bet that's why

314
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:32,597
he insisted on coming with us
to the park.

315
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,295
- You've been weird
about Dr. Tate from the start.

316
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:35,470
To me, the evidence suggests

317
00:10:35,513 --> 00:10:37,037
that James killed his wife
and fled.

318
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,127
It's my case, and that's
the lead we're following.

319
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,302
- Okay.

320
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:42,651
You're right.
I'm sorry.

321
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:44,392
I was being unfair.
It's your case.

322
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,654
You call in an APB,

323
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:46,959
and I will meet you back
at the precinct.

324
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:48,483
I'm just gonna
swing by the bank.

325
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:49,832
- You're not gonna go
to Dr. Tate's office

326
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,007
and search it behind my back,
are you?

327
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,095
- What? Charles, no.

328
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:53,662
I wouldn't do that.
You can trust me.

329
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:55,011
- Okay, I trust you.
- Good. You should.

330
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,621
- Well, I do.
- Great, because you can.

331
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:57,883
- I feel good about it.
- Good, you should

332
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,233
- I think
it's the right choice.

333
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:01,235
- You're making the right call
by trusting me.

334
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:02,497
Not.

335
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,107
"Wayne's World."
Sweet.

336
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,507
- All right, think.

337
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,769
Where would I hide
the real notebook

338
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:15,336
if I was a creepy therapist?

339
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,251
In my butt.

340
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:18,687
Focus, Jake.

341
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,211
Now is not the time
for being hilarious.

342
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:30,351
What have we here?

343
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:32,266
James and Susan Buckley.

344
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,837
- So your day's
been going well?

345
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:40,665
- It has, it has.
- They're blocking my way out.

346
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,406
- A cancellation,
and so I was able

347
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,234
to get more work done.

348
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:45,714
- Yeah.
Well, that's always nice.

349
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:47,237
Same thing happened to me
yesterday.

350
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:49,979
- Is that right?
- Yeah, two cancellations.

351
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:52,721
You know?
At least it wasn't three.

352
00:11:52,764 --> 00:11:54,244
- Have a good afternoon.

353
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:55,245
- You too.
- Okay.

354
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:56,812
- See you in the morning.

355
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:58,857
Oh, um, can I help you?

356
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:00,250
- Yes.

357
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:03,166
I am...

358
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,254
your new patient.

359
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:06,169
- Garrett?
- Garrett...

360
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:07,301
is my name, yes.

361
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:08,867
- You're an hour and a half
early.

362
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:11,653
- I know. I have problems
with time management.

363
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:13,350
That's the issue
I want to talk about.

364
00:12:13,394 --> 00:12:15,135
- On the phone,
you said you were concerned

365
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:16,745
you might have
multiple personality disorder.

366
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:18,007
- Yep, that too.

367
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,748
Got buttloads of peeps
living in my brain,

368
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,228
no doubt, no doubt, no doubt,
no doubt, no doubt.

369
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:22,838
We should talk about it.

370
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:25,319
- I can't believe it's taken
so long for us to meet.

371
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:26,624
You're so nice.

372
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:27,973
- Oh, I don't know about that,
Jocelyn.

373
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,279
I'm just being myself.

374
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:30,889
- Well, you're very sweet

375
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,282
about the cosmetology thing.

376
00:12:32,326 --> 00:12:34,241
A lot of people are dismissive
of hairstylists.

377
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:35,677
- It makes no sense.

378
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,635
If we didn't have hairstylists
to cut our hair,

379
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,289
our hair would be far too long.

380
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,291
- Wow, great compliment.

381
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,727
- Hey, you're the girl

382
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:44,338
from the diarrhea commercial,
aren't you?

383
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,730
You get diarrhea on the plane.

384
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,254
- That's not true.
- Yeah, move along.

385
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:49,038
- I don't get diarrhea
on the plane.

386
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:51,432
I get diarrhea in the airport.

387
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:54,783
- What's going on?

388
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,264
Are you... an actor?

389
00:12:57,307 --> 00:12:59,614
- Well, you don't have to sound
so grossed out.

390
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,964
I can see why you didn't want
him meeting Jocelyn.

391
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,748
- Excuse me?
- This isn't Jocelyn.

392
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,402
It's Sheena.
She's an actress.

393
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:08,013
- Yeah, I was in an episode
of "SVU."

394
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:09,319
I say, "We want answers."

395
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:10,712
The director
tried to replace me,

396
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,018
but Mariska said
it would take too much time,

397
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:15,586
and then they all agreed
I'd probably cut together fine.

398
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,633
- Look, Diaz, I've obviously
misread our relationship.

399
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:20,504
You didn't want me to meet
the real Jocelyn

400
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:25,248
because we're not as close
as I thought we were, so...

401
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,207
message received.

402
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:31,298
- Hey, so you don't
by any chance

403
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,516
need any molly, do you?

404
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,431
- I'm a cop.
- And scene.

405
00:13:34,475 --> 00:13:37,608
Now I'm out of character,
and I don't sell any drugs.

406
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:38,392
I am leaving.

407
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:39,567
- So, Garrett,

408
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,003
where would you like to begin?

409
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:43,266
- You know what,
can we crack the door a little?

410
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,876
I get very claustrophobic,

411
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,662
probably from all the different
people living in my head.

412
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:49,533
- We usually keep it closed
for privacy,

413
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:51,666
but whatever makes you
comfortable.

414
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:53,407
- Thank you.

415
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:56,236
Damn it, he's still here.

416
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,802
- Excuse me?
- Hmm?

417
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:01,284
Uh, I was just talking
to another one of the voices.

418
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:02,720
- Is it Tatiana?
- Who now?

419
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:04,244
- The mischievous
seven-year-old British girl

420
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,549
you told me about on the phone?

421
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:06,724
May I speak with her?

422
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:08,509
- Uh...

423
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,730
Yes?

424
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:14,428
Hello, Doctor.

425
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,386
I'm from Wussex.

426
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,909
- Is that an actual place
in England?

427
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:19,128
- How should I know?

428
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:21,522
I'm just a little girl,
I am, I am.

429
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:23,567
- Well, it's nice to speak
with you, Tatiana.

430
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:26,266
Can I say hello to Brian,

431
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:29,573
the bookkeeper
from Central London?

432
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:31,009
Cheers, I'm Brian.

433
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:33,925
I like bookkeeping
right in the middle of London.

434
00:14:33,969 --> 00:14:37,929
Did I tell you a full list
of my many personalities

435
00:14:37,973 --> 00:14:39,322
when I called you
on the ol' telly, innit?

436
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:40,454
- Yes, you did.

437
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:43,500
- And are any of 'em,
hopefully,

438
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:44,588
not from England?

439
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:45,589
- There's Geoffrey.

440
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,243
You said he's Australian.

441
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,464
- Aww, crikey.

442
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:53,467
- Hey, Sarge.
I saw the flyers.

443
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,859
You really put a lot of them
up, huh?

444
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:56,513
- I just want to make
extra sure

445
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:57,993
we find the real book-buyer.

446
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,952
- Do you think it's
this kind of overcompensation

447
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:03,607
that's been making things
difficult in the bedroom?

448
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:05,740
- Oh, I don't compensate.

449
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:07,872
I procreate.
Three kids.

450
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,787
- Okay.
Weird brag.

451
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,181
Look, just take the book.
Nobody cares.

452
00:15:12,224 --> 00:15:15,402
- Hey, I just saw this.
I think you have my book.

453
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:18,318
- Oh, really?

454
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:19,667
Told ya!

455
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,364
- But you're not even married,
Scully.

456
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:22,974
- I'm in a committed
relationship,

457
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,889
and Cindy Shatz
says I'm a selfish lover.

458
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,717
- All right, well,
what about the protein powder?

459
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:27,936
- I'm trying to get ripped.

460
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,154
I drink, like,
six shakes a day,

461
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:30,373
but nothing's happening.

462
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:31,635
- Do you also exercise?
- What?

463
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,810
You're supposed to exercise?

464
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:34,334
You know what, keep the powder.

465
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:35,813
I'll drink normal milkshakes.

466
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:38,425
- And you thought
that was my book.

467
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:40,514
Shame on you, Amy.

468
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,472
Shame on you.

469
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:46,476
You got the book?

470
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:50,088
You should know,
things are good with Sharon.

471
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:52,352
I just want to make sure we're
as happy in our relationship

472
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:53,657
as we can be.
- That's nice, Sarge.

473
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:54,876
- Sorry you had to
embarrass yourself.

474
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,356
- Not a big deal.

475
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,358
I guess I just don't care
what other people think of me.

476
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,533
- That's actually
pretty inspiring.

477
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:00,795
I wish I was more like that.

478
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:02,666
- Yeah.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

479
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,755
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

480
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,322
You're not gonna wait for me
to leave?

481
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,630
- Like I said,
I just don't care.

482
00:16:10,848 --> 00:16:13,024
- Well, Garrett,
our time is up.

483
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,374
Shall we pick up here
next week?

484
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:16,680
- No, I can't go.

485
00:16:16,724 --> 00:16:20,597
There's still someone
left inside that wants to talk.

486
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:21,816
- Do you mean Satchel,

487
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:24,296
the "gentle
African-American man

488
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,429
who was born in 1908"?

489
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,823
- Oh, no,
you know what?

490
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,433
Satchel probably shouldn't
come out right now.

491
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:31,521
Or ever, for that matter.

492
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:33,262
- Garrett, I can only help you

493
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:34,698
if you open up.

494
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:39,181
And then Dufresne

495
00:16:39,224 --> 00:16:44,447
escaped through the tunnels
of Shawshank Prison.

496
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:45,796
He was my friend.

497
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,451
- Are you just doing
Morgan Freeman?

498
00:16:48,495 --> 00:16:49,452
- Ah, yes!

499
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,714
You calling me on it

500
00:16:50,758 --> 00:16:51,976
just gave me
a major breakthrough.

501
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,892
I'm cured!
Anyway, deuces, Doc!

502
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,987
I've got you now,
you son of a bitch.

503
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:04,641
- Hello, Peralta.

504
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:07,252
- You really thought you could
sneak around my office

505
00:17:07,296 --> 00:17:08,558
without me noticing, huh?

506
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:09,690
- How'd you know
I was in there?

507
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,561
- Your shampoo left an odor.

508
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:12,954
I could smell you.

509
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:16,479
- I knew it!
You're a Hannibal.

510
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,136
- Pull over right here.
Cut the engine.

511
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:24,182
- Why are you doing this?

512
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:25,706
- Because you found
my notebooks,

513
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:29,318
and I assume you've deduced
what I did to Susan and James.

514
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,015
- You killed James too?
- Oops.

515
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:32,669
I guess you only deduced
the Susan part.

516
00:17:32,713 --> 00:17:34,192
But it doesn't matter.

517
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,107
You never would have thought
that James was a suspect.

518
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,501
He was such a kind
and gentle man.

519
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,024
- So why did you kill them?

520
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:41,548
- Well, because
they were gonna tell people

521
00:17:41,591 --> 00:17:44,246
about my affair with Susan
and ruin my career.

522
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,987
- I knew it.
- I had to do it

523
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,379
for the sake
of my other patients.

524
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:49,077
You know,
there are a lot of people

525
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,600
who depend on me
for their well-being.

526
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,646
- Yeah, except for the ones
that you murder.

527
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,170
- That's only happened twice.
- It's happened before?

528
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:57,085
- The Rothmans.
Nobody misses them.

529
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:59,043
- You really are
a terrible therapist.

530
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,611
- Oh, wow, strong words
for someone

531
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:04,832
who is clearly scared
to talk about his own issues.

532
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,486
- I'm not scared, okay?

533
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:07,922
For example,
I had an issue

534
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,663
with texting while driving,
but I fixed it.

535
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:11,926
Now I just don't look
at my phone while I type.

536
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:12,927
- Case in point.

537
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,102
Just know that you died

538
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:15,538
without saying anything real.

539
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:17,148
- Okay, okay, okay!
Stop.

540
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,541
Fine, you want something real?

541
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:20,282
I tried therapy.
It only made things worse.

542
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:21,805
- Uh-huh.
Go on.

543
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:24,547
- When I was a kid,
I was acting out at school,

544
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:26,897
so they made me and my parents
do family counseling,

545
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:29,030
but instead of helping me
with my problems,

546
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,292
the stupid therapist
just brought up

547
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:31,554
all my parents' issues.

548
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:33,251
And once it was all out
in the open,

549
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:34,862
they fought all the time
and eventually got divorced,

550
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,387
and everything good in my life
just... went away.

551
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,041
- Interesting.
So you actually

552
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:42,522
blame yourself
for your parents' divorce?

553
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,349
- No, I blame the therapy,

554
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:46,090
which we only had to do
because I—

555
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,396
oh, my God.

556
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:49,572
I do blame myself.

557
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:52,619
Oh, here come the waterworks.

558
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,798
- Excuse me, do you have
a less crinkly dollar

559
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:59,669
I could trade you for?
- Of course I do.

560
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:01,932
None of my dollars
has a single crinkle.

561
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,891
When they do,
I steam them.

562
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,502
- Oh.
Wow, that is crisp.

563
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,635
- Can't wait to get this baby
home and flatten it out.

564
00:19:10,158 --> 00:19:11,463
Almonds, nice choice.
- Oh, thanks.

565
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,769
They're, uh—
they're not for me.

566
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:15,032
They're for my girlfriend,
Detective Diaz.

567
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:17,948
- Oh, you must be Jocelyn.

568
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:19,471
- What?
No, I'm Denise.

569
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:21,909
Who's Jocelyn?
Is Rosa cheating on me?

570
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,867
- Oh, my...

571
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:25,129
- No, that was a joke.

572
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,914
I'm sorry,
I thought it would be funny.

573
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,263
I am Jocelyn.

574
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:30,613
- Oh, that was actually
very funny.

575
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:32,267
I didn't know
what was happening,

576
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,573
and then I thought
I knew what was happening,

577
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:35,096
but what I thought
I knew was happening

578
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,141
wasn't what was happening.

579
00:19:37,185 --> 00:19:38,447
That's very good.

580
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,709
- You must be Captain Holt.
- Mm-hmm.

581
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:40,884
- Hey.
- Hey.

582
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:42,190
- Uh, can you give us a second,
babe?

583
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:43,539
- Yeah, I'll wait out there.

584
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,193
Pleasure to meet you, Captain.

585
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:48,805
- So this is Jocelyn?

586
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,546
- I'm glad you got to meet her.
For the record,

587
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,330
I wasn't keeping her from you
because I was afraid

588
00:19:52,374 --> 00:19:53,723
you were gonna hurt
her feelings by being judgy.

589
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,595
I think it's hilarious
when you're judgy.

590
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:57,553
It's because I was afraid
you weren't gonna like her.

591
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,469
You and I are close, and I...

592
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:01,731
I value your opinion.

593
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:02,819
- Well, she seems great,

594
00:20:02,863 --> 00:20:04,255
in our limited interaction.

595
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:05,517
- Maybe you could
get to know her better

596
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:07,476
over Kevin's rice
this weekend?

597
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,391
- That would be great.

598
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:10,479
You might want to save
your girlfriend.

599
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:11,915
She's talking to Hitchcock.

600
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,351
- Damn it, Hitchcock!

601
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:14,962
- So I joke about my father
so much

602
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,660
to avoid processing
all the pain he's caused me.

603
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:20,445
- Yes. You are doing
such great work here.

604
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:22,012
- I'm really feeling it.
- Yeah.

605
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:25,755
Now, I'm sorry, but our session
is coming to a close.

606
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,018
I guess I'll have to bill
your widow.

607
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:29,672
- Wow, that is cold-blooded,

608
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:31,631
but I got to hand it to you,
it's a pretty dope kill line.

609
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:33,458
Unfortunately, no one
will be billed, though.

610
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:34,764
Isn't that right, Charles?

611
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,723
- Hi, Dr. Tate!
- What? How did he—

612
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:39,682
- Told you I could text
without looking at my phone.

613
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:40,814
- Let's go.

614
00:20:40,857 --> 00:20:42,729
- Oh, man, I am so glad

615
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:44,034
you got my message
with the location.

616
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,383
Pretty impressive, right?

617
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:46,689
- Well, actually,
you just texted

618
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,430
a bunch of crazy, weird,
random letters.

619
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:49,910
It made me concerned,
so I tracked your phone.

620
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:51,868
- Well, still pretty good.
I found you in my contacts.

621
00:20:51,912 --> 00:20:53,478
- It went to Amy.
She forwarded it to me.

622
00:20:53,522 --> 00:20:54,784
- It worked.
Let's stop talking about it.

623
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:56,003
- Listen, I'm sorry.

624
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,613
I guess you were right
about the therapist.

625
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,702
- Yeah, well, that's nice
of you to say, Charles,

626
00:20:59,746 --> 00:21:02,879
but actually,
when I was stalling Dr. Tate,

627
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:05,055
I started talking
about my parents' divorce,

628
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,318
and it felt really good.

629
00:21:07,362 --> 00:21:08,929
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but...

630
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:11,061
I think I'm gonna make
an appointment with a shrink.

631
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:12,715
- Jake, that is so great.

632
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,804
And I know a guy
who's really good.

633
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,980
You will love having him
inside of you.

634
00:21:17,024 --> 00:21:18,460
- Okay.

635
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:20,854
- What?
Oh, come on, mister. Grow up.

636
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:23,160
Get your mind
out of the gutter, ya perv!

637
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:25,162
- Fremulon.

638
00:21:25,206 --> 00:21:27,469
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
