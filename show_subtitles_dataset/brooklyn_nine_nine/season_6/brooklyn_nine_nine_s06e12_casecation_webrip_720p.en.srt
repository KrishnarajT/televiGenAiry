1
00:00:04,907 --> 00:00:06,996
- Hey, what's up?
I came as fast as I could.

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,345
- Title of your sex tape.
Nailed it.

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,434
So have you ever heard of a guy
named Bruno Rojas?

4
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:11,957
- Yeah, big guy
in the Colombian cartel, right?

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,872
- He was, until he got shot
in the chest yesterday

6
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,352
by his top lieutenant.

7
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:17,006
Apparently, the bullet went
straight through his nipple.

8
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:18,442
- Whoa.
Nature's bull's-eye.

9
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,835
- Oh, my God, I love the way
your brain works.

10
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,837
Anyway, he's in a coma now,
and Captain Holt thinks

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,882
if I'm here when he wakes up,
I can get him to talk.

12
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:25,928
- So what'd you call me for?
- Because I need a partner.

13
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:28,191
- What about them?
- Oh, we're not here for work.

14
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:30,323
I brought Scully in because
he needs some medical tests.

15
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,890
- Yeah, I'm here all the time.

16
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:33,544
I'm kind of the mayor
of this place.

17
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:35,807
Cheryl, baby,
you got a fresh bag for me?

18
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,418
- Saving you the biggest one,
Scully.

19
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:38,462
- You're too good to me.

20
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,203
Anyway, I'll see you guys
around.

21
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:42,640
Dan, Dan, the enema man.

22
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:45,034
- Well, guess it's kind of nice
to see Scully in his element.

23
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:46,165
- Whoo!

24
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:47,428
- Jake, I can't stay here
with you.

25
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:49,081
I have so much on my plate
at work.

26
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,387
- Yeah, so do I.

27
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,258
I mean, I've been pulling
double shifts nonstop,

28
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,131
but we haven't really gotten
to hang out in almost a month.

29
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:56,480
Our anniversary is coming up,

30
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:57,829
and we don't even have
anything planned.

31
00:00:57,873 --> 00:00:59,744
- I know, but we talked
about this.

32
00:00:59,788 --> 00:01:01,746
We're gonna take a trip
as soon as we have time.

33
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,269
I promise.
- Just like you promised

34
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,662
we would see
the "Bumblebee" movie?

35
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:06,534
- I didn't promise that.
I believe what I said was,

36
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:07,622
"Isn't that a kids' movie?"

37
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:09,537
- Yeah, and I believe
what I said was,

38
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,017
"It's for teens."

39
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:14,455
Look, I get that you can't
take any time off from work,

40
00:01:14,498 --> 00:01:16,761
but this is a loophole.
It's still work.

41
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:18,415
You know,
we can hang out here

42
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:19,895
and chat and catch up
and laugh,

43
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:22,288
and technically,
we'll be doing our jobs.

44
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,117
I call it a "casecation."

45
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:27,946
♪ Casecation,
all I ever wanted ♪

46
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,947
- Ooh.

47
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:30,688
- ♪ Casecation,
had to get away ♪

48
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:32,124
- Babe, this is so sweet,

49
00:01:32,168 --> 00:01:34,344
but do you honestly think
that Holt's gonna let me

50
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:36,259
just hang out here
with you indefinitely?

51
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:37,695
- Yes. Just tell him
I need supervision.

52
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,349
I've spent the last six years
building up a reputation

53
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:41,394
as an irresponsible goof
for this very moment.

54
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,484
- That is ridiculous.
Holt respects you.

55
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:45,311
- Does he, though?

56
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:48,314
- Hello, you've reached
the office of Raymond Holt.

57
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,751
I can come to the phone
right now.

58
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,796
- Hey, sir, I'm just here
at the hospital with Jake,

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,058
and I think he could use some—

60
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:56,322
- Oversight?
Agreed.

61
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,715
- So?
- ♪ Casecation

62
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,543
♪ All I ever wanted

63
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,696
- Prepare to be romanced.

64
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:23,175
Voilà.

65
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,612
- Bienvenue à Paris.

66
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:26,657
- Bonjour, madame. Fromage?

67
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,658
- Don't worry,
Charles is leaving

68
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:28,877
in a second.
- I am?

69
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,921
- Yeah, you were just
helping me set up.

70
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:31,706
- Fine. Enjoy your weird
anniversary

71
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:34,273
with just the couple,
you selfish jerks.

72
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:36,667
- Thank you for your help!

73
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:39,931
So what do you think?
- I love it.

74
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:41,759
It's really romantic.
- Aww.

75
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:43,152
- I mean, except
for the comatose body

76
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:44,370
in the middle of the room.

77
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,676
- Oh, yeah, just pretend
he's part of Paris.

78
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,851
Imagine we're on a walking tour

79
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:48,897
of the Louvre,
and he's a statue.

80
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,942
- Oh.
- Yeah. Shall we, ma chérie?

81
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:53,379
I asked the lady at the store
what her favorite cheeses were,

82
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,859
and those were all
super expensive,

83
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:57,427
so I got us a budget-conscious
selection of local cheddars.

84
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,387
- So, a full year of marriage.
What was your favorite part?

85
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,607
- Are you asking me
to do a marriage highlight reel

86
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,043
countdown
à la "NBA Inside Stuff"?

87
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:07,045
- I mean, that's not exactly
what I was—

88
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:08,569
- Number five!

89
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:10,222
Ahmad Rashad.
It's my best impression.

90
00:03:10,266 --> 00:03:11,615
Number five was the time

91
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,748
that we accidentally got
our contact lenses switched.

92
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:14,923
I got to see the world
through your eyes.

93
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,359
- But our prescriptions
are different,

94
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,230
and the world was so blurry.
- Yeah, it was crazy.

95
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:19,362
I thought I was having
a stroke.

96
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:21,103
Okay, your turn.
- Number four!

97
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:23,584
- Oh, is an old witch
introducing this highlight?

98
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:24,672
- That was exactly
what you sounded like.

99
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:25,673
- No.
- Yes.

100
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:26,848
- Agree to disagree.
- Fine.

101
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:28,850
Number four was
when we played laser tag

102
00:03:28,893 --> 00:03:30,460
and we shot all those
little kids.

103
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,767
- Oh, yeah. We really messed up
little Mason's birthday party.

104
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,768
- Mm-hmm.
- Deservedly so.

105
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:34,812
He was a jerk.
- Ugh.

106
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:36,031
- Okay, what should
number three be?

107
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:37,554
Ooh, I know.

108
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:39,817
It was that time we shared
an UberPool with Michael Caine.

109
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:40,818
- Oh!

110
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,172
- I mean, obviously,
Michael Caine

111
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:49,087
was shooting a movie in London
at that time, and also,

112
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:50,698
why would Michael Caine be
in an UberPool?

113
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,569
- But it was still so cool.
- It really was.

114
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:55,006
We shared a car with Alfred.
- We did!

115
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,312
Okay, number two.

116
00:03:56,355 --> 00:03:57,879
This might be
my favorite moment

117
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:00,272
of our entire time as a couple:
January 6th.

118
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:02,623
- Eddie Redmayne's birthday.
- Why do you know that?

119
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,667
- 'Cause he was weird
in "Jupiter Ascending."

120
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,190
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm just a fan.

121
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,452
- Yeah, that's not what
I'm talking about.

122
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,063
- Okay.

123
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,892
- It was the coldest night
of the year,

124
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:13,503
and you put socks on my feet
while I slept.

125
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,461
You never even took credit
for it.

126
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,680
- But now I'm getting credit
for that

127
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,377
and for not taking credit.

128
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:19,944
That's double credit, you fool.

129
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:22,294
- You two are just the cutest.

130
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,296
I can't wait for number one!

131
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,602
- Oh, it's Ahmad Rashad.

132
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:27,473
- I'm Pam.
I'm from next door.

133
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,301
I was listening
to the two of you talk

134
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:30,563
and just had to get a look.

135
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:34,393
You're both very attractive.

136
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:38,223
- Aren't they?
- Boyle, go home!

137
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:39,703
- Oh, Pam can stay but not me?

138
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,009
- Yeah, because
she's a patient here.

139
00:04:41,052 --> 00:04:42,488
I'm assuming,
because of your gown.

140
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,925
- I am.
I have a twisted bowel.

141
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:47,058
I have a tube; I have a bag.
Do you want to see?

142
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:48,712
- Oh, no, no, no.
But thank you, Pam.

143
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,758
- Let me know
if you smell anything.

144
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,542
I don't even notice it anymore.

145
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,586
- Well, I'm pretty sure

146
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,675
I actually already
smell something.

147
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:56,720
- No, you'll know.
- Oh.

148
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,156
- Do you two have kids?

149
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,507
Mixed race babies are always
so adorable.

150
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,727
- Oh, you said words.

151
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,511
- Yeah, we don't have kids yet,

152
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,991
but we're gonna start trying
soon.

153
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:08,993
- I just have the one,
my Bobby.

154
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:12,649
He was such a cute little kid,
until he discovered his wiener.

155
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:16,174
- Pam, there you are.
It's time for your IV.

156
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:18,568
You're playing music in here?
You can't do that.

157
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,004
- Why not, Nurse Janet?

158
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:22,006
Is it gonna distract
the doctors?

159
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,008
- Yes, that's exactly
what it'll do.

160
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:25,531
- Okay, fine,
I'll turn it off immediately.

161
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:30,232
- Are we the bad guys here?
- Yeah, it seems very likely.

162
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:31,494
Hey, by the way,

163
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:32,495
we don't have to pretend
we're undercover here.

164
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:33,757
The hospital staff knows
we're cops.

165
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:34,932
- Oh, I wasn't
setting up cover.

166
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:36,151
Was I?
- Well, just the kids thing.

167
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:37,543
Saying that we were gonna
start trying soon.

168
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,850
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean right away.

169
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:42,200
I just meant
in the near future.

170
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:44,202
- Oh.
Okay.

171
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:45,464
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.

172
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:46,814
Cool, cool, cool, cool,

173
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:48,206
except for that there's
one little problem there,

174
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,078
which is that I don't know
that I totally know

175
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:53,385
that I for sure
want to have kids,

176
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:54,778
so...

177
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,867
- You don't?
- No.

178
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:59,435
Do you?
- Uh-huh.

179
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:01,829
- Oh.

180
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:04,962
- I don't understand.
I thought we were

181
00:06:05,006 --> 00:06:06,659
on the same page about kids.

182
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:08,139
We talked about this.
- We did?

183
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:11,142
- Aw, look at these pictures
my brother sent of Matthew.

184
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:12,622
- Mm.
- We should do this someday.

185
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:13,666
What do you think?

186
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:14,885
- Are you kidding me?
Of course.

187
00:06:14,929 --> 00:06:16,539
I was talking about going
to the water park.

188
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:18,193
You were talking about
having kids?

189
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:20,804
- Yeah! I said, "Do you think
we can afford it?"

190
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,372
And you said, "We'll start
saving right away."

191
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:24,590
- So let me get this straight.

192
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,462
All that water park money
I've been saving,

193
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:27,855
you want to spend it
on kids now?

194
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:29,726
- Yeah. Why would you want
to spend that much money

195
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,119
on a water park?

196
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:32,642
- Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say here.

197
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,862
I just—
I never wanted children.

198
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:36,211
- Well, I always have.

199
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:38,561
- All right,
so how do we handle this?

200
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,824
- I mean, there's only one
thing to do when two people

201
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:43,305
have diametrically opposing
views on a subject.

202
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:44,654
- Talk about it lovingly
and decide how to move forward?

203
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:46,743
- Structured debate.
- Oh. Fun.

204
00:06:46,787 --> 00:06:48,745
- High school format.
Modified Lincoln-Douglas.

205
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,574
Let's take one hour apart
for research and prep. Yeah.

206
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,881
- Great, I'll just do
a Lincoln-Douglas.

207
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:56,753
- I'd be careful if I were you.
Relationships are like bowels.

208
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:59,364
Once you get them twisted,
they can never untwist.

209
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,192
- Pam, you're in here again.

210
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:10,549
- That's all you prepped?

211
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:11,637
- Yeah,
I just searched my heart

212
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,378
and then wrote down
how I was feeling.

213
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,598
- I'm gonna eat you alive,
you dumb son of a bitch.

214
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,905
- Cool. And then
we'll have kids together?

215
00:07:17,948 --> 00:07:19,210
- Yeah. It's gonna be great.

216
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:20,516
Okay, the topic today

217
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,431
is whether or not
we should have children.

218
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,562
I will be taking
the affirmative.

219
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:24,737
You will be taking
the negative.

220
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:26,391
Each round will be
individually scored

221
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:27,828
by our judge, Captain Holt.

222
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:29,307
- Do you need to hear
my credentials?

223
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:32,441
Debate moderator license
D as in delta, 8-1-0—

224
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,399
- I believe you.
- Y as in Yankee, 4-1.

225
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:36,837
J as in Juliet,
J as in Juliet, 6.

226
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,577
- Great.
- I have a variety of timers.

227
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:40,231
Do you prefer a buzz or a ding?
- Don't care.

228
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:41,450
- Ding.
- Okay.

229
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:42,930
Peralta, you can present
the first argument

230
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:44,235
from your, uh...

231
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,889
Scribbled list of feelings.

232
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,151
- I'll have you know

233
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:48,849
that I have some
data-driven arguments as well.

234
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:52,156
According to a study I read,
people with kids

235
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,506
were less likely to report that
they were happy in their lives

236
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,030
than people without kids.

237
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:59,207
Now, call me crazy, but being
happy tends to make me feel,

238
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,382
uh, pretty happy.

239
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:01,470
- Where did you read
this study?

240
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:02,514
- Well, it wasn't
something I read

241
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,865
so much as told about.

242
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:06,040
- And who told you about it?

243
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:09,608
- Hitchcock.
- Hitchcock?

244
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,001
- Yeah.
- That seems like

245
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:12,916
a pretty intellectual thing
for him to mention.

246
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,483
What was the context?

247
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:17,312
- He had invested in a NuvaRing
competitor called Vag-a-Plug

248
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:18,966
and was practicing
his sales pitch on me.

249
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,011
- This is your first argument?
Your opening statement?

250
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,056
- Point to Amy.

251
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:23,492
- All right, fine.
Forget the study.

252
00:08:23,535 --> 00:08:25,276
I just don't want to lose
what we already have.

253
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,496
- Ask anyone with children
and they'll tell you

254
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,586
children bring meaning and love
into your life.

255
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:32,849
Yes, there may be some moments
that you lose,

256
00:08:32,893 --> 00:08:34,851
but there will also be
new moments.

257
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:36,287
Take the water park.

258
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:40,335
I would never go with you,
but you know who would?

259
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:42,598
Your kid.
- Point to Amy.

260
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,208
- That's not your call to make,
Peralta.

261
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:45,514
Point to Amy.

262
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,472
- Okay, fine.
New subject: work.

263
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,344
We both work way too much.

264
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:50,475
Why bother having kids

265
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,955
if you never get
to spend time with them?

266
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,349
I mean, I love my job,
and I know you love yours,

267
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:55,393
and I don't think it's fair
for either of us

268
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:56,960
to have to sacrifice that.

269
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,701
- Do you know why I want to
become lieutenant so badly?

270
00:08:58,744 --> 00:09:00,398
- To prove your worth to
your hyper judgmental parents.

271
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:01,660
- Yes, obviously that.

272
00:09:01,704 --> 00:09:03,227
But also, the higher your rank,

273
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,794
the more control
over your hours.

274
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,970
Plenty of people
have jobs and kids, Jake,

275
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,450
and they find a way.

276
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:09,973
- This has become more about
your employment status.

277
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,802
As your supervisor, I feel
I have a conflict of interest

278
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,369
and should abstain
from judging.

279
00:09:14,412 --> 00:09:15,979
- Okay, so do we both
get a point?

280
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,155
- No. Kevin has been
on the phone all this time.

281
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,201
He's also a licensed
debate moderator.

282
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:22,855
- License number
J as in Juliet, 2-5-9...

283
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:24,640
- This means nothing to me.
- H as in hotel.

284
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,381
Z as in Zulu.
- Oh, thank God he stopped.

285
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:27,686
- 3-6-9.

286
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,558
Point to Amy.
- Okay, fine.

287
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:33,170
You want to know why I really
don't want to have children?

288
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:35,346
I had a crappy dad.

289
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,218
I know what happens
when you mess up as a parent.

290
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,741
It's not great.

291
00:09:38,784 --> 00:09:41,570
And this may come as a shock
to you, but...

292
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:43,311
I kind of have some dad issues
with certain people.

293
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:44,442
- Holt.
- Me.

294
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:45,922
- Raymond.
- Yeah, but not just him.

295
00:09:45,966 --> 00:09:48,446
It's every male authority
figure from my entire life.

296
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,231
- Hey, Jake, can you move
"Legends of the Fall"

297
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:51,319
from new releases into drama?

298
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:52,407
- You got it, Dad.

299
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,409
Craig was only six weeks older
than me.

300
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,758
- Since this has become
about me,

301
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:57,629
I'm gonna have to abstain
from this round as well,

302
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:59,240
but Kevin is still standing by.

303
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:00,893
- Actually, I feel as though
your personal relationship

304
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:02,591
with Peralta
affects me too.

305
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:04,419
Luckily, I had Gail
standing by as well.

306
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,029
- Oh, my God,
you guys know Gail?

307
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,248
- Who's Gail?

308
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,292
- Vice president
of the Debaters Club.

309
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:09,902
- This is a very big deal.

310
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:11,078
- Do you need to hear
my credentials?

311
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,254
License number
U as in uniform, 7—

312
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,473
- No!
No more credentials, please.

313
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:16,866
I don't want to have
a structured debate.

314
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,520
It's an idiotic way
to decide something.

315
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:19,521
- What?
- How dare you?

316
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:20,826
- Is he insane?

317
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,306
- Raymond, Kevin,
I'll be reporting this.

318
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,525
- Okay, look.

319
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:26,745
Amy, I'm scared, okay?

320
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:28,269
I'm scared that
we're gonna have a child

321
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:29,574
and I won't be able
to handle it,

322
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:31,098
I'm scared that
I'm not gonna be a good father,

323
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:34,275
and I'm scared that I'll make
a mistake I can't take back.

324
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,973
- Jake, I get it.
I'm scared too.

325
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:38,888
- Every other big decision
I've made in my life

326
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,020
I was sure about:

327
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:41,847
becoming a cop,
asking you to marry me,

328
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,980
buying those Jordan 1s
for $500.

329
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,721
- Wait, you spent $500
on sneakers?

330
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:47,549
- Yeah, they were so cool,
and if I had never worn them,

331
00:10:47,592 --> 00:10:48,854
they would have kept
their value.

332
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,508
- So they lost their value?
- Yes, all of it.

333
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,119
I stepped in a puddle
as soon as I left the store.

334
00:10:52,162 --> 00:10:53,294
But this isn't about
the Jordans.

335
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:54,773
This is about the fact

336
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:57,211
that I don't want to bring
a human being into this world

337
00:10:57,254 --> 00:11:01,041
unless I'm 100% sure that
I'm ready to take care of it.

338
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,825
Okay?

339
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:04,479
- Too emotional.
Point to Amy.

340
00:11:04,522 --> 00:11:05,915
- Okay, Gail is clearly biased.

341
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,482
I think we need
a new moderator.

342
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,787
- Bob Templeman here.

343
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,876
- What? How many people
are on this phone call?

344
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,403
- Hey, so Holt went to go
smooth things over with Gail.

345
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:16,447
He thinks we may
just have to pay

346
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:17,796
the Debaters Guild
a small fine.

347
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,885
- Cool. And as you can see,
Pam is here.

348
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,148
She has some thoughts.

349
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:22,627
- I was saying to Jake,
before Bobby,

350
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,021
I didn't think I wanted
to have kids either.

351
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:27,154
But he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

352
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:29,112
- Hey, Pam, could you give us
a minute?

353
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:31,419
- Oh, of course.
I'm gonna call my friend JoAnn.

354
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:34,291
She's been waiting for
a big update on all of this.

355
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:37,468
- Great.

356
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,994
- I'm sorry.
The debate was a bad idea.

357
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:43,518
I just...

358
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:45,824
I felt ambushed by the fact
that you didn't want kids,

359
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:47,478
and I thought I could fix it
with logic.

360
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:49,001
- I mean,
what if I had won the debate?

361
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:50,351
- Jake, I'm trying so hard
to be nice,

362
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:51,874
but I don't know how to respond
to that.

363
00:11:51,917 --> 00:11:53,049
- Cold-blooded but fair.
- I get it.

364
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:55,138
You're scared.
I can't change that.

365
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,226
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean

366
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,185
I'll never change
how I feel about it.

367
00:11:58,228 --> 00:11:59,577
I mean, I used to be scared
of sushi,

368
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:00,883
and now it's my favorite food.

369
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:03,015
I got tuna sashimi
from a pharmacy the other day.

370
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,669
- You shouldn't have.
- Yeah, it was very warm.

371
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:06,062
I got so sick.

372
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,238
Look, can we just press pause
on this conversation?

373
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:10,153
I mean, let's enjoy our lives
for a little bit,

374
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,850
and then maybe the next time
it comes up,

375
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:14,070
I'll feel differently, okay?

376
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:18,161
- No.
- What?

377
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:19,510
- I need an answer
from you now.

378
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:21,033
Like right this minute?

379
00:12:21,077 --> 00:12:23,035
- You can take a day or a week,

380
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,385
or maybe a month.

381
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:27,214
- That's not a lot of time,
Ames.

382
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:29,433
I mean, that doesn't seem
totally fair.

383
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:30,869
- Well, now you know
how I feel.

384
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:33,481
Women don't have the luxury
of waiting till we're 60

385
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,657
and then changing our minds
and getting remarried

386
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,007
and having a baby
with some dumb 28-year-old.

387
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,095
- Oh, come on.

388
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:40,401
There's no way
I'm gonna be rich enough

389
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:43,360
that a 28-year-old
is gonna want to be with me.

390
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:44,622
Did that help?

391
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,189
Look, I don't understand
what the big deal is.

392
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,886
You're still young.
We have plenty of time.

393
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,324
- I know, but I don't want
to wait around for two years

394
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:52,195
and then have you decide
you don't want kids,

395
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,980
'cause I don't want
to start over at 38.

396
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,983
- Start over?

397
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,159
Like, with someone else?

398
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:02,727
- ♪ Casecation,
all I ever wanted ♪

399
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:05,643
♪ Casecation, had to get away

400
00:13:05,687 --> 00:13:06,949
♪ Casecation

401
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:09,081
♪ The vibe in here
is really weird ♪

402
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,213
- I think they're having
a fight.

403
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,388
- No, it's not a fight,

404
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,869
it's just a devastatingly sad
conversation

405
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:15,044
about whether or not
we should have kids

406
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,350
or just start over,

407
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,178
so you were totally wrong,
Rosa.

408
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:19,440
- What? You got married

409
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,181
without talking about
if you want children?

410
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:22,356
- Yeah, and we also got married
without discussing

411
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,574
whether or not we like
water parks.

412
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:25,097
A lot of new stuff has come up,
okay, Terry?

413
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:26,708
- Why are you guys here?
- A CI came in.

414
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,231
There's a lot of chatter that
whoever tried to kill Rojas

415
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,232
is coming to finish the job.

416
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,320
- At the hospital?
- Yeah.

417
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:31,843
Holt wanted extra manpower
here.

418
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,889
- Okay, why don't you two
lock down the nurses' station

419
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:35,238
while Amy and I
secure the room?

420
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:36,848
- Actually,
I'd rather be with Rosa.

421
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:37,893
- Uh-oh.
- Damn, Jake.

422
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:39,590
Thanks a lot, Sarge.

423
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:40,461
- You told me to sing!

424
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:41,940
- Yeah, but what was all this?

425
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:43,768
- That's just Terry
being Terry.

426
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:45,161
- Okay, from this vantage

427
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:46,684
we can see the elevator
and the stairs.

428
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:48,947
No one should be able to get
to Rojas without us noticing.

429
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:50,775
- Cool.
- Hey, look, um...

430
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:52,777
I don't want you to get caught
in the middle of this stuff

431
00:13:52,821 --> 00:13:53,778
between me and Jake.

432
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:54,997
I don't want you
to choose sides.

433
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,390
- Already chose. I'm with you.
- Really?

434
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,478
I didn't know you wanted kids.

435
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,653
- I don't know
if I'll ever want kids,

436
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,045
but you should have them.
They're so cute.

437
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,960
It's up.
- Aw, it is up.

438
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:03,135
- Anyway, do you want me
to talk to Jake?

439
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:04,876
I'm a pretty good bully.
- Thanks, but no.

440
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,488
I've got this covered.
I left him alone with Terry.

441
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:09,054
That guy is
a walking advertisement

442
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,360
for the joys of fatherhood.

443
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:13,450
- Do not do it.
- What?

444
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:15,278
Don't you love your girls?
- So much.

445
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:16,540
You should have seen Cagney
this morning

446
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,412
with her little braids in.
- Oh.

447
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:20,327
- But they are a ton of work,
man.

448
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,286
If you are not totally,
100% sure you want them,

449
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,287
you won't survive.

450
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,289
- Is it really that hard?
- Yes.

451
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,639
I never get any sleep.
I'm always sick.

452
00:14:28,683 --> 00:14:30,989
I never get to watch anything
I want on TV.

453
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,643
I still haven't finished
"Breaking Bad,"

454
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:34,471
but I can recite "Moana"
from memory?

455
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:37,561
"Maui, shape-shifter,
demigod of the wind and sea.

456
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,172
I am Moana."
Why do I know that?

457
00:14:40,216 --> 00:14:41,391
- I don't want to watch
kids' movies.

458
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:42,914
I want to watch movies
for adults.

459
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,002
Adults and teens.

460
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:45,656
- And they are getting
so manipulative.

461
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,006
Yesterday,
Cagney pretended to be hurt,

462
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,399
I went in to help her,

463
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:51,662
and Lacey snuck in the kitchen
and stole two cookies.

464
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:53,490
- Oh, my God.
Your children are monsters.

465
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:54,926
- Hey, those are my kids, man.

466
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,101
Back off.
- Right.

467
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,233
- And the crazy part is,

468
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,061
I really do want to go
to the water park,

469
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,192
but I can't give that to him

470
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:01,324
because it's the only card
I hold.

471
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,499
- Mm.

472
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,979
Elevator.

473
00:15:04,022 --> 00:15:06,242
- Excuse me, NYPD.
Can I see your ID?

474
00:15:07,896 --> 00:15:09,158
- Amy, behind the wheelchair.

475
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,986
- NYPD! Stop!

476
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:17,340
- Diaz for Jeffords.
- This is Terry.

477
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,602
- I think we got our guy.
Colombian man,

478
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:20,038
unarmed,
but he tried to run

479
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,388
as soon as we identified
ourselves.

480
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,041
And he's got a picture of Rojas
on his phone.

481
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,217
- We'll be right there.

482
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:27,045
- No one in or out
of this hallway.

483
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,352
Why do you think that guy
is unarmed?

484
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,223
- Who knows? Maybe he was
trying to smother Rojas

485
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,529
or unplug his life support.

486
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:35,315
- Or maybe he's a distraction,

487
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,578
and someone else is going
for the cookie jar.

488
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:38,622
- What?

489
00:15:43,018 --> 00:15:44,759
- Hi, Pam.

490
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:46,064
- Hi, Jake.

491
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:48,763
Don't come any closer,
or I'll blow us both up!

492
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:53,507
- I'm sorry.

493
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,856
You weren't supposed
to be here.

494
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,510
This wasn't part of the plan.
- It's okay, Pam.

495
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:57,859
No need to panic.
We're just talking.

496
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:01,079
Look, I'm just gonna
put this away.

497
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:02,516
No, Terry,
don't open that, please.

498
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,995
- What's going on in there?

499
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,910
- There is a woman in here
with an explosive device.

500
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:08,043
- What? You okay?
- Yep. Everyone is fine.

501
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:10,045
I just need you to evacuate
this entire floor,

502
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:12,134
call ESU and the bomb squad
right away,

503
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:14,179
and jam all cellular
and Wi-Fi signals.

504
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,790
- On it.

505
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,619
- Okay, Pam, so we're just
gonna stay calm here

506
00:16:18,662 --> 00:16:20,011
and talk this thing through
as friends.

507
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,839
- This isn't supposed to be
happening.

508
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:24,712
The man said that I'd be able
to sneak in here unnoticed.

509
00:16:24,755 --> 00:16:26,104
- What man?
Who asked you to do this?

510
00:16:26,148 --> 00:16:28,193
- I didn't get his name,
but he was very attractive.

511
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,021
Antonio Banderas could play him
in a movie.

512
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,545
What has he been doing lately?

513
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,460
You know what?
He should be on "Outlander."

514
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:34,635
- Okay, Pam,
I'm gonna cut you off,

515
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:35,549
but it's not because
I'm not interested.

516
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,680
- I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

517
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:37,768
I get chatty
when I get nervous.

518
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:39,248
- This man who gave you
the bomb,

519
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,555
did he happen to mention
whether or not it's on a timer

520
00:16:41,598 --> 00:16:42,947
or if there's
a remote detonator?

521
00:16:42,991 --> 00:16:45,254
- I don't know.
I'm terrible with electronics.

522
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,736
I wish my son Bobby were here.
He taught me how to iPad.

523
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,738
- Okay, I also know
how to iPad,

524
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,435
so maybe I could take a look.

525
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,697
- Stay where you are!

526
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,569
The man told me
that when I got the bomb set,

527
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:57,614
I should text him
with this phone

528
00:16:57,658 --> 00:16:59,007
and if anything went wrong,

529
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,356
I should push this button.

530
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,010
- No, no, no, no!
You don't want to do that.

531
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,490
- Yes, I do.
I have to.

532
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,013
- Well, there's only one thing
to do when two people

533
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,581
have diametrically opposing
opinions on a subject.

534
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:09,583
Structured debate.
- What?

535
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:10,758
- Yeah, I just learned
about it.

536
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:12,281
All right, I will argue
the negative:

537
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,325
I don't want to blow up.

538
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,762
And you can argue
the affirmative:

539
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:16,633
you do want to blow up,
which I have to say, Pam,

540
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:18,026
is a very tough stance to take.

541
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,114
- I don't want to blow up,

542
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:21,421
but the man said
he'd give me $500,000.

543
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:24,119
This is so Bobby can take care
of my granddaughter.

544
00:17:24,162 --> 00:17:26,034
That girl means the world
to me.

545
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,078
- Fine, fine.
Point to Pam.

546
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:28,602
But if you care about her
so much,

547
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:29,733
how can you just
blow yourself up?

548
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:30,734
You'll never get to see her
again.

549
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:31,909
- Well, at least I know

550
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:33,563
she'll be financially
well taken care of.

551
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,610
- Sure, but is this really how
you want her to remember you?

552
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:38,176
As a murderer?
- I'd rather be remembered

553
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,701
as a woman who blew up
a mobster to help her family

554
00:17:40,744 --> 00:17:41,963
rather than a librarian

555
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,356
whose bowels are tied up
like a sailor's knot!

556
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,228
- Okay, that's a very strong
argument.

557
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:47,272
Very strong.

558
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,491
But you're forgetting
one thing.

559
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,058
You're not just gonna be
killing a mobster.

560
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,494
You're also gonna be
killing me.

561
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,714
- He said the blast would only
hurt people in the room.

562
00:17:53,757 --> 00:17:55,150
You could just walk right out
of here.

563
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:57,892
- Pam, you know
I can't do that.

564
00:17:57,935 --> 00:17:59,720
Now, please,
just give me the bomb.

565
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:00,982
- And then what?

566
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,853
Bobby doesn't get any money
and I go to jail?

567
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:04,159
I can't go to jail.

568
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:06,335
Every roommate I've ever had
has hated me.

569
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,511
In college, I had a roommate
named Mary-Ellen,

570
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,992
and she was dating the brother
of Steve Guttenberg—

571
00:18:11,035 --> 00:18:12,080
- Pam, what are we talking
about here?

572
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,647
- I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.

573
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:14,996
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I know it probably feels like

574
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,476
you don't have a lot of options
right now.

575
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:19,043
In fact, this whole situation
probably feels like—

576
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,002
like a twisted bowel,
but it's not.

577
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:23,657
There's still one end
of this bowel that's open.

578
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,833
- Which end?

579
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:29,271
- The butt end.
- I'm listening.

580
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:31,534
- Okay, if you hand me
that bomb right now,

581
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:34,755
nothing bad will have happened,
and that'll be because of you,

582
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:36,234
because you cooperated.

583
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,976
Also, I'm sure a judge
would understand

584
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,151
how you got into
this situation.

585
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:41,631
I mean, you were asked
to do this

586
00:18:41,675 --> 00:18:43,938
by an Antonio Banderas type.
Who could say no to that?

587
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:45,983
And even if you do go
to prison,

588
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,246
it is gonna be
such a fancy prison.

589
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,946
- With a lot of crafts?
- Yes, with tons of crafts.

590
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:55,036
Pam, listen to me.

591
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,908
Let's untwist this bowel
together.

592
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:01,738
Let's clear everything out.

593
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:07,918
- Okay.

594
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:12,140
You did great, Pam.
Thank you.

595
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,228
- Now that it's out
of my hands,

596
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:14,795
I can see it really is a bomb.

597
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:15,926
- Yes. Yes, it is.

598
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,538
- Oh, my God, get some help!
- Okay.

599
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,716
- You okay?
- Hey.

600
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,631
Yeah, I'm okay.

601
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,895
- Really surprised by Pam.

602
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:29,897
I did not see that coming.
- Right?

603
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,028
You should have seen
the look on my face

604
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,421
when I saw it was her.

605
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,249
- Your jaw just dropped.

606
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,511
- Oh, she's right there.
- Mm-hmm.

607
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:38,122
- Good-bye, Pam.
Good luck with everything.

608
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,124
Kind of liked her in the end.
- Yeah.

609
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:42,431
So did they defuse the bomb?

610
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:43,650
- Yeah, one of 'em.

611
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:46,609
Oh, you didn't hear?
There was a second bomb.

612
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:47,915
Ya butt.

613
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,960
Ya butt is da bomb.
- Aww.

614
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:52,267
On our anniversary.

615
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,182
Speaking of which,
I requested next week off

616
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:56,663
so we can take
an actual vacation...

617
00:19:56,706 --> 00:19:58,273
to the water park.

618
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:01,015
- I've never been more in love
with you in my entire life.

619
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:04,105
And hey, I've been thinking,

620
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:07,848
and I do want to have kids.

621
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:10,502
With you.

622
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:13,636
- You're not scared anymore?
- Oh, no, I am so scared.

623
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,898
Maybe even more so than before,

624
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:17,074
but I was scared in there
with Pam too,

625
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:20,164
and you know, I didn't panic
or mess anything up there.

626
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,863
If anything, I was sharper.
I was a freakin' debate genius.

627
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:25,300
- Debate genius?
Oh, that's very hot.

628
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:28,346
- Oh, that's an added bonus.
Okay, keep that energy up.

629
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,698
But the point that I was
actually trying to make is,

630
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,309
maybe it's a good thing
that I'm scared of fatherhood.

631
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:37,747
You know? Maybe it'll turn me
into a freakin' dad genius.

632
00:20:41,055 --> 00:20:42,665
But we don't have to start
trying right away, right?

633
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,537
I mean, I don't know
that I'm all the way there yet.

634
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,496
- No, of course not.

635
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:50,412
Whenever we're both ready.
- How do you know when that is?

636
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:52,109
- I guess we'll just
have to have another one

637
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:54,851
of these really fun,
casual conversations.

638
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:56,505
- Cool. Love that.
Can't wait.

639
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,465
Can we go home now?
- Yes, please.

640
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,250
Maybe we can grab
some Thai food

641
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:03,686
and brainstorm baby names?

642
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,166
- Ooh, I like that.

643
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:07,559
- Now, I am a fan of the show
"American Gladiators."

644
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:11,563
How do you feel about the name
Blaze Peralta?

645
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:12,695
- Not great.

646
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,610
- What about Laser?
- No.

647
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:15,611
- Nitro?
- No.

648
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:16,612
- Viper?
- No.

649
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:18,875
- Atlas?
- Ooh, I do love atlases.

650
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:21,095
- Mm, common ground.

651
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:24,925
- Fremulon.

652
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:27,231
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
