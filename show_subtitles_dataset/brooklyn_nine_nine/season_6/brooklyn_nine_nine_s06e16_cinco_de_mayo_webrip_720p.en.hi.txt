Other Scully.

173
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,015
- Hi, I'm Earl,
Norm's twin brother.

174
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:42,538
- [mimicking explosion]
- Why's Scully never mentioned

175
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:44,192
he had a twin before?

176
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:45,890
- Because no one talks about
their siblings with coworkers.

177
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,369
- I've told you about
my brother Lawrence.

178
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,719
- Nope, and I don't want to
learn about him

179
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:49,981
and I already forgot his name.

180
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:51,373
Now let's go.
It's time to heist!

181
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,593
- No movement yet.
So here's our plan.

182
00:05:53,636 --> 00:05:56,814
After watching everyone coo
over your maudlin proposal,

183
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,772
I've decided we should
employ a similar diversion.

184
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,208
- Smart, I'm in.
- You will tell Jake

185
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:01,644
you are pregnant
with his child.

186
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,037
- What? I'm not pregnant.

187
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,473
- Here is a positive
pregnancy test

188
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:05,866
and a sonogram of your fetus.

189
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,563
Congratulations.
It's a girl.

190
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,304
- Feels a little mean
to play with Jake's feelings

191
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:10,784
like that, sir.
- You're right, it is mean.

192
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,046
Too bad.

193
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,179
As your mentor,
I command you to do it.

194
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:15,658
- Wow, okay.

195
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:18,444
Perhaps we should
discuss some other options.

196
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:19,706
- There's no time, look.

197
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,229
Peralta's going
for the bracelet!

198
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:23,014
- How'd he get him
free so quickly?

199
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:24,450
- See ya later, losers!

200
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:25,668
- Not so fast!

201
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:28,410
[taser crackling]

202
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,672
What the hell was that?

203
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:31,109
- That Fitbit I gave
you at Christmas?

204
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:32,806
I modified it into a taser.

205
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,765
- What? Do you even want
me to get into shape?

206
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,505
- Yeah, but not as
much as I want to win.

207
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:37,811
Buzz buzz, bitch.

208
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,160
- I've got Scully.
Come on, let's go.

209
00:06:39,204 --> 00:06:41,728

210

No! Nooo!

211
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,560
- Yes.

212
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:48,866
- Fake heist went perfectly.

213
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,563
- So did the real heist.

214
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,913
- Why is your face
twitching like that?

215
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:54,567
- Oh, Amy tased me a bunch.
I bit my own tongue.

216
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,612
It was awesome. Was it hard
to get through the door?

217
00:06:56,656 --> 00:06:58,136
- No. I'm strong as hell.

218
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:00,094
The hard part was getting this
bracelet off Scully's wrist.

219
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,923
How can you even feel your
hand with this thing so tight?

220
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:04,011
- You're supposed
to feel your hand?

221
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:05,447
- Well, that's terrifying.

222
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,971
Now if you'll excuse
me I'm going to hide

223
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:08,711
the old bracelet and
win me this heist.

224
00:07:08,755 --> 00:07:10,104
- Don't you mean
win us this heist?

225
00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:12,498
- Oh, Terrence,
unfortunately I do not.

226
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,457
- What the hell?

227
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,676
- Sorry, Sarge.

228
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,025
It had to be this way.
- Why?

229
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,287
- The banner only has
my name on it.

230
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:20,636
It's really all about the
banner.

231
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,029
It unfurls by
a voice command.

232
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:23,465
But I promise that I will
mention

233
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,859
both you and Earl Scully
in my victory speech.

234
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,208
- Wait, Earl's here?

235
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:28,296
- Yeah. He helped us
with the heist.

236
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,863
- I told that son of a bitch

237
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,039
never to show his face in
New York again!

238
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,475
- Why are you running
towards the glass?

239

[glass shatters]

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,567
- You're a dead man, Earl!

241

- That's not great.

242
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:40,918
- You're a dead man, Jake!

243
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,267
- Uh, that's much worse.

244
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,663
- Squirt more lube
and help me yank.

that fun braggy recap

246

we do at the end of each win?

247
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:51,145
Can we leave this part out?

248
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,277
- [grunts] Yes.

249
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,452
We'll make up a cooler thing.

250
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,149
But for now,
we lube and yank.

251

Norm?
- What the—

257
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,336
- I'm so happy your
friend invited me to—

258
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,468
- I told you
what would happen

259
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:10,904
if I ever saw
you again, Earl.

260
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,993
- What is going on?
What am I looking at?

261
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,908
- Scully has a twin
brother named Earl.

262
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,605
Jake brought him
here to trick you.

263
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:17,998
- Thank you
for the ride, Terrence.

264

Apparently they don't
get along very well.

265

- We did get along.
We were inseparable,

266
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:23,351
until Earl slept
with my wife.

267
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:24,831
- It's not my fault she wanted

268
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,528
to have sex with a stud
instead of a dud.

269
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,791
- Stud? Your face looks it's
been kicked in by a horse!

270
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,402
- Well, your mouth
looks like a butthole!

271
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,056
- Your whole body
looks like a butthole.

272
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:33,100
- And you look identical.

a real mind eff.

Good-bye.
- Just so you know,

282
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,727
Jake has the bracelet
in his pocket.

283
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:53,164
- Why would you tell them that?
We're a team!

284
00:08:53,207 --> 00:08:54,339
- You locked me up.

285
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,688
- Yeah, but they
didn't know that!

286
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,255
- There's no bracelet
in his pocket!

287
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,648

- Shalom, partner.
- Dope.

Shlomo Ben-Yisrael

291

wouldn't come through.

292
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:08,527
- No, I said the name
and the costume

293
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,616
were offensive,
bordering on actionable.

294
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,835
- Well, it worked.
Jake brought in Scully's twin

I connected them on Facebook,

they hated each other.

And when everyone
was fighting,

they were too distracted
to notice old Shlomo.

They all underestimated me,
Rosa, but today,

of their ways, for today,

00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:54,720
- And it was a huge mistake

345
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,113
and I now realize that
our friendship

346
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,853
is way more important
than any stupid banner.

347
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,639
Look, the bracelet
is in Cheddar's chew toy.

348
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:02,510
I know because I bugged
Holt's cummerbund.

349
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:04,512
- You did?
- Yes! I figured he would

350
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:06,079
bring it in to show off.
Now let's do this!

351
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,602
- I don't know.

352
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:08,777
- Look, Sarge,
I'm sorry, okay?

353
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:10,605
I can't undo the past,
but come on.

354
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,129
Would you rather
win the heist with me or sit

355
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,696
around swallowing eggs like
Birdo from "Super Mario 2"?

356
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,698
- Birdo doesn't eat eggs.
Birdo spits them!

357
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,309
- Oh, my God, you got
that reference, Terry?

358
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:22,095
We're the perfect team!
Come on, Sarge, please?

359
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,792
- Fine, I'll help.
- Ah! Wonderful.

360
00:11:23,836 --> 00:11:25,055
But, before you fully commit,

361
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,882
I should probably
give you the heads-up.

362
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:29,102
My plan is very elaborate and
you might get a little messy.

363
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,235
- I'm in.
It's the heist, baby!

364
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:33,193
Now let me know how
we get that chew toy.

365
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:34,586
- All right!
Okay.

366
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:35,935
First, I infiltrate Holt's
office and continue

367
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:37,893
our argument about
who won last year's heist.

368
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:40,896
- How many cummerbunds are
you holding right now? Zero!

369
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,725
It's one bund to none, son!
Tell him, Kevin.

370
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,726
- I'm leaving.

371
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,076
- It doesn't matter—

372
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,686
- As Holt argues with me
I will be covertly

373
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:49,688
releasing more water
into Cheddar's bowl.

374
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,733
Then we sit back
and wait for...

375
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,518
[Cheddar whimpers]
- Potty time again?

376
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:54,997
- What if he takes
him downstairs?

377
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,695
- He won't.
I spent a lot of time

378
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,436
making clandestine searches
on Holt's computer.

379
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:01,656
Now all of his targeted ads
direct him straight to...

380
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,789
- The Puppy PeePee Pad.
Intriguing.

381
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:05,225
- He bought one
and put it out

382
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:06,879
on the roof next
to Gina's golden statue.

383
00:12:06,922 --> 00:12:08,837
And, because he believes
that Cheddar deserves

384
00:12:08,881 --> 00:12:10,752
to pee in privacy like any
other self-respecting adult,

385
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:14,147
he will leave Cheddar outside
alone to do his business.

386
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,410
- Notify me when you're done,
via bark.

387
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:17,933
- While Holt guards the door,

388
00:12:17,977 --> 00:12:20,458
you'll be swapping out
Mr. Hootsworth for this.

389
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,112
- That all sounds great,

390
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:23,722
but how do I get onto the roof
without Holt noticing?

391
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:25,593
- Oh, Sarge.
You'll already be out there...

392
00:12:25,637 --> 00:12:28,727
In a perfect golden disguise.

393
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,599
- The plan worked! I got it!

394
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:33,340
- Oh my God, you
look like an Oscar. Ooh!

395
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:34,950
We should take a picture where
it looks like I'm holding you.

396
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:36,169
- Jake.
- You're right.

397
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,779
There's no time.
We'll do it later.

398
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,911
- No, we won't!
Help me get this paint off!

399
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:40,217
- Okay, put your hands out and

400
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,609
I'll squirt you with
a little makeup remover.

401
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:42,610
Hi-ya!

402
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:43,785
- No!

403
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,918
You're betraying me again?
Why?

404
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:47,572
- Because of the banner!

405
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:49,182
- But I thought you said our
friendship was more important!

406
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,836
- Yeah, that was
obviously a lie.

407
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,054
The banner was very expensive!

408
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,230
I don't have
a lot of money, Sarge.

409
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,276
All right, bye.

410
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,364
Don't make a lot of noise.

411
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:02,935
- Howdy. I just got back
from lunch with Charles,

412
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:04,197
who is not here.
I am real glad

413
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,720
I skipped the heist.
Say, who is winning?

414
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,113
- I don't know, but I know
that I am not winning.

415
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:09,246
- Interesting,
it is also not me.

416
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,247
- Uh, why are you guys
acting so weird?

417
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,813
- Gah, weird?

418
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,033
Would a person who is acting
weird laugh like this?

419
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:15,730
A huh-huh huh-ha, carefree!

420
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:17,297
- Yes.
- Jake!

421
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:19,430
- Oh, Terry, you ripped
yourself free.

422
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:21,171
- Yeah, maybe you
should try cuffing me

423
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:22,694
to a stronger metal
next time.

424
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:24,043
- Yeah, I don't know the
relative strength of metals.

425
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:25,305
- What's going on?

426
00:13:25,349 --> 00:13:26,654
Why does Terry
look like an Oscar?

427
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:28,743
- Doesn't he?
- He has the bracelet!

428
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:29,875
We grabbed Mr. Hootsworth

429
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:31,485
from Cheddar and
swapped it for a fake!

430
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:34,140
- Wow, Terry, my betrayals
were all in good fun,

431
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:35,359
but this really hurts.

432
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:37,926
- Cheddar,
bring me Mr. Hootsworth.

433
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,842
It's an updated model.

434
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,628
The bowtie is Turkish blue
instead of Egyptian blue.

435
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:45,151
How could you not
have noticed this?

436
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,935
- Because he's a dog.

437
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:51,113
And at the end of the day a dog
is no match for Jake Peralta.

438
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:53,072
- Well yours is a fake, too.
Turkish blue bowtie.

439
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,291
- Oh, come on!
The one time

440
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,683
I say out loud
I'm smarter than a dog?

441
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:57,119
- If I have a fake
and you have a fake,

442
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:58,817
who took the real bracelet?

443
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,340
- I did.
- Kevin?

444
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:01,950
- I swapped out Mr. Hootsworth
for a fake

445
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:03,648
while you were arguing
with Peralta.

446
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,606
- How many cummerbunds are you
holding right now? Zero!

447
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,217
It's one bund to none, son!

448
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,697
- You betrayed me?
But why?

449
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:11,308
- I can't have more of
these trophies in our home.

450
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,526
The cummerbund was already in
the living room.

451
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,267
What's next,
a rusty medical bracelet

452
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,921
suspended above our bed?

453
00:14:15,964 --> 00:14:17,488
- Yes! Now hand it over.

454
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:18,967
- I don't have it.
I gave it to Amy.

455
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:20,491
- [gasps]
- Santiago.

456
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,493
- You betrayed me as well?
- You betrayed me first.

457
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:24,103
You were working with Rosa
this whole time.

458
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:25,322
- That wasn't real.

459
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,714
I was always gonna
stab her in the back.

460
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:28,281
- You were?
What kind of person treats

461
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,848
another human being
like that?

462
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:31,197
- You tricked me, Rosa!

463
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,807
And then you shipped
me to New Jersey!

464
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:34,505
- First of all, grow up.
Second of all, how'd you

465
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:35,636
get back here so fast?

466
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,072
- If you get a box wet enough,

467
00:14:37,116 --> 00:14:38,160
it's very easy to
bust out of it.

468
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:39,510
- No one ask any follow-ups!

469
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:41,076
- I knew I couldn't
trust you, Rosa.

470
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,861
That's why I was going to
double-cross you with Bill.

471
00:14:42,904 --> 00:14:44,906
That's right,
he didn't really die.

472
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,300
- Hey, guys, you really thought
I'd miss this year's heist?

473
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,867
No way, I'm part of the squad.

474
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,303
- No.
- Not true.

475
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,522
- Okay, this is official
getting hard to track.

476
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,219
Who has the bracelet now?

477
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:54,568
- Santiago.

478
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:55,874
- Yeah! And none of you
are getting it!

479
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,049
- We'll see about that.

480
00:14:57,092 --> 00:14:58,790
[taser crackling]
- [groans]

481
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,052
What the hell?

482
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,532
- Remember that very
fancy Swiss pen I got you

483
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:02,881
for Christmas,
the one that you keep in

484
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:05,492
your pocket at all times?
It's a taser, bro.

485
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:07,320
[beeping]
- Uuugh!

486
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,322
I'll take that. Amy,
do not make me tase you again.

487
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,281
- No, no, no, no, don't!
I'm pregnant!

488
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,108
- What?
- I just found out.

489
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:14,893
It's a girl.
- Oh, my God!

490
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:16,590
- Oh my God, it's happening!

491
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,244
Quick, someone get a reaction
video of me becoming an uncle!

492
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:21,073
- She's making it up.
The pregnancy scam was my idea.

493
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:22,727
- No.
No, no, no, no, Amy.

494
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,729
Wait, is that true? Did you
just lie to me about our baby?

495
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,339
- Yeah, did you lie to
us about our baby?

496
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,341
- You tased me!
- You tased me first!

497
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,821
- Enough!
Terry's had enough of this.

498
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,910
This was supposed to be

499
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:35,087
just a fun game but it's turned
you all into terrible people.

500
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,872
Betraying your husband, putting
your friend in the mail.

501
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,571
Jake and Amy, did you guys
buy each other any gifts

502
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:42,355
this year that weren't tasers?

503
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,617
- No.
- No.

504
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:45,576
- You all pretended that
this was all about

505
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:49,231
helping me with my test.
But none of you cared one bit!

506
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:51,756
You know what?
You all suck!

507
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,974
[beeping]

508
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,194
- Oh no, my voice command.
Terry, look out!

509
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:56,891
- [groans]

510
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,546
- Okay. I know that was bad,
but let's not jump to
