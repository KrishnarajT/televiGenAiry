- Gentlemen, may i present
to you the suicide squad.

3
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:09,380
- Hang on there, genius.
You want us, your enemies,

4
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:11,207
To help you bring down
commissioner kelly?

5
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:12,513
- You guys consider me
your enemy?

6
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:14,036
You're some of my best friends.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,690
- We haven't talked to you in,
like, three years, c.J.

8
00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:17,431
- Wait, yeah.
I'm thinking of different guys.

9
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,477
- Oh, raymond, that you came
to me to ask for help

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,782
Shows how much you've matured.

11
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:22,175
You know what else shows
how much you've matured?

12
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:23,698
Your withered face.

13
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:25,874
- Now i know why you refer
to this as a suicide squad,

14
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:28,703
Peralta, because i already
want to kill myself.

15
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:30,705
- Why don't you wait a week?
You'll probably die of old age.

16
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,054
- The only way i'm going to die

17
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,882
Is if you touch me with
one of your bony fingers

18
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:37,103
And drag me across
the river styx, you reaper.

19
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:38,713
- Ah, wonderful.
Very creative.

20
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:41,020
Look, john kelly
has to be stopped.

21
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:42,325
He's spying on civilians.

22
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,066
It's unconstitutional
and it's wrong.

23
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,459
- Please.
Do you think any one

24
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,287
Of these jackals cares about
what's right or wrong?

25
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,549
- [whistles] i'll help.
- See, sir?

26
00:00:48,593 --> 00:00:50,029
There is good in every person.

27
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:51,334
- But i want it to be known
it's for selfish reasons.

28
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:52,466
- Why would you want that
to be known?

29
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,641
- 'cause i've never
met c.J. Before

30
00:00:53,685 --> 00:00:55,034
And i want him to think
that i'm cool.

31
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:56,383
- It's working.

32
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:57,689
I mean, i love how
you're taking over the room.

33
00:00:57,732 --> 00:00:58,864
- Like that?
Yeah, it's awesome.

34
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:00,256
- You know,
i actually wouldn't mind

35
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,475
Getting rid of
john kelly either.

36
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,737
That guy makes up
so many dumb rules.

37
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:04,304
He told me i couldn't
eat raw chicken.

38
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:05,871
- And you think
a new commissioner will—

39
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:07,655
- Yeah, he's already on board,
so yes, a new commissioner

40
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:09,875
Would let you eat raw chicken
for whatever reason.

41
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:11,354
- It's healthier.
- It sure is, ceej.

42
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:12,878
- And what do you hope
to get out of this, madeline?

43
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:14,096
Let me guess—

44
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,446
Revenge on dorothy
for killing your sister?

45

raymond—

46
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:19,145
I think what john kelly
is doing is terrible.

47
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:20,451
- Yes, well said, wuntch.

One, two—

- I don't touch
other dudes' hands.

- Whose hand is sticky?
- It might be me.

53

I ate a popsicle earlier.
- It's probably madeline.

Special equipment for us

stingrays can't detect them.

Don't usually say
they're in denial.

112
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,148
- That's because
they're in denial

About being in denial.

114
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:36,587

a kickass music festival.

- Best friends.
He got a bum rap.

You can learn about it when
my documentary comes out.

where it clearly belongs—

00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:08,531
With the island people.

we need to catch kelly

In the act of illegally spying,
so here's the plan.

00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,669

so serious

That he's forced
to deploy the stingray.

137
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,151
- What kind of crime?
- We're gonna kidnap a cop.

138
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:21,457
But not just any cop—
it needs to be someone

139
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:22,763
So high-Ranking that
it sends shockwaves

140
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:24,373
Through the system,
but not important enough

141

impacts the nypd in any way.

We'll use cool rubber masks.

of "the first wives club."

155
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:53,707
- We're not gonna do
"first wives club" masks.

156
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,056
- Just because
you can't be keaton?

00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,232
Grow up, jake!
- No, because they don't exist.

And also, yeah,

00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:00,105
Keaton is clearly
the coolest one and

160
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:02,150
I don't think it's really fair
that you just "called her."

161
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:03,935
Forget it.
We'll wear scary gorilla masks.

162
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,501
- Approaching the target.
- Okay, let's do this.

163

00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,896
But all that matters is that
wuntch planted the bug on kelly.

338
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,029
- No. I didn't.
- What's that now?

339
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,031
- You don't trust me,
i don't trust you.

340
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,120
The mission is off.
Here's your bug back.

341
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,731
It's not an actual bug,
so don't eat it, you lizard.

342
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:25,169
- Ha! You didn't specify
the subspecies of lizard.

343
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:26,518
I won that round!

344
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,085
- Oh, my god.
Will you give it a rest?

345
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:33,046
- Oh, man. I can't believe
this wild ride's over.

346
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,265
We've changed so much.

347
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:35,918

talky-Talky rosa,

350
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:44,231
Terry the stoner,
and c.J. The ringleader.

351
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,537
- I'm not sure
you're nailing these.

352
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,930
- Okay, i smoothed things over
with madeline,

353
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:49,758
And she's agreed
to rejoin the suicide squad.

354
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:52,935
- Oh, goody gumdrops.
But do we even need her?

355
00:10:52,979 --> 00:10:54,241
What does she bring
to the table?

356
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:56,417
- 30 years of police experience.
- I have 33.

357

As a uniformed officer
in nypd history.

361
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,383

i never spent much time in

362
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:08,995
Uniform because i was promoted
to detective after one month.

363

- They're not allowed to do
that. It's against the rules.

364
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,955
- It's also against the rules
to let a pile of worms

365
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,609
Wear a uniform,
and yet here you stand.

366
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:16,698
- Okay, just stop.
Look, sir, i've explained this.

367
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,049
Wuntch is the only one
that can get close to kelly.

The worm pile stays.
- Great.

370
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:25,055
- That was our last obstacle—
except for one other thing,

371
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:26,273
I promised her that
you would apologize

372
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:27,492
For everything
you've ever done to her.

373
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:29,581
- Including the
michelle obama incident?

374
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:31,061
- Yes, she mentioned
that specifically.

375
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,323
I'm very curious
what happened there.

376
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:34,847

But fine.

377
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,372
I'm sorry, madeline,
for everything.

378
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,767

michelle obama

then running away.

- It was very funny.
- Apology accepted.

383
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,296
There's a policeman's ball
tonight.

384
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,298
I can plant the bug
on kelly there.

385
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,213
And since you don't trust me,
you can be my plus one.

386
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:55,781
- Oh, please.
Everyone knows we're enemies.

387
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:57,478
It would raise suspicions.
- Don't worry.

388
00:11:57,522 --> 00:11:59,437
I know just what to tell people.

389
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,005

Lovers.

391
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:06,748
- So, we can assume kelly
authorized stingray surveillance

392
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,142
And we missed it, but if we
ratchet up the pressure on him,

393
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,752
We might get another chance.

394
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,319
- How do we ratchet up pressure
more than we already have?

395
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:14,495
- By making him believe that
the "kidnappers" are serious,

396
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:16,018
And that c.J. Is in real danger.

397
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:19,021
- Ooh, what if we send kelly
a severed finger in a box?

398
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:20,675
- No way!
I need all my fingers.

399
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,503
How else am i gonna do
the hang ten sign?

400
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:24,026
- Nobody's cutting off
your fingers.

401
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,680
I meant we would get one
from the morgue.

402
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:27,247
- From the morgue?

403
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,510
Man, we are always getting
into the craziest situations.

404
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,817
If i were leaving this squad,
i'd miss these moments,

405
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,123
But i'm not, so i won't.

406

What's going on with him?

407
00:12:34,646 --> 00:12:35,690
- It's a whole thing.
- Is it gonna screw up the plan?

408
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:37,039
- It's more quietly
self-Destructive.

409
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,172
- Sounds good. Terry, do you.
- I have an idea.

410
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,043
So when my dad lost his
flower shop, my aunt bruce—

411
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,697
- Charles, we don't have time
for a weird boyle story

412
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:44,090
Right now.
Just tell us your idea.

413
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:45,396
- We make a scary hostage video

414

we're gonna kill c.J.

415
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:47,746
- Ooh, i love that.
Wait a minute.

416
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:49,139
Your dad did that
to save his flower shop?

417
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,270
Was your aunt the hostage?
What happened?

418
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:51,619
- You said we didn't have time.

419
00:12:51,663 --> 00:12:52,881

the coolest story ever.

420
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:54,405
- Oh, it is.

421
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:56,015
- Well then, tell the whole
thing and spare no detail.

422
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,190
- Okay, so you know how aunt
bruce can lactate on command?

423
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,713
- Of course.
- Guys.

424
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:00,367
- Yeah, sorry. All right.
So we'll make a hostage video,

425
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:01,934
But i don't think
we should do it here.

426

It's too nice.

427

a real creepy basement?

one exposed light bulb

That came with the house.
I tried to peel it off,

435

Kobe.

504
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,874
- But kobe never passed.

505
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:45,053
- I can't go to prison.
I couldn't even get through

506
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:45,967
The scary parts of the musical,
"chicago."

507
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,142
- Does anyone
have a good lawyer?

508
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:48,535
- I got a divorce guy,
an alimony guy,

509
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,755
A slip and fall guy,
a pizza's too hot guy—

510
00:15:50,798 --> 00:15:53,671
- Everybody just relax.
We're not gonna go to prison.

511
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:55,325
It's all gonna work out
in the end.

512
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:57,065
Should we play celebrity?
- Come on, man.

513
00:15:57,109 --> 00:15:58,502
- Yeah, come on, terry.
No one wants to play celebrity—

514
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:00,417
The best game ever made—
but he does have a point.

515
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,983
Nothing bad is gonna
happen to us.

516
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,158
- Wrong!

517
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:04,334
You turds are about
to get flushed.

518
00:16:04,377 --> 00:16:06,074
Come on, peralta.
You're up first.

519
00:16:06,118 --> 00:16:07,424
Let's go.
- Oh, cool.

520
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,948
So, i'm the first turd
to be flushed.

521
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:11,689
Bye, you guys.
What are you doing?

522
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:13,734
You were gonna get promoted
out of missing persons.

523
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,083
- Your plan went to hell,
tough guy.

524
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:16,955
Wuntch—she came to me
with a much better one.

525
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:18,913
Guess what she's giving me
for betraying you?

526
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:20,306
My dream job—
captain of the—

527
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,568
- 69th precinct.
- Bingo.

528
00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:23,135
- Look, you're not gonna
get away with this.

529
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:24,397
You were a part
of the whole thing.

530
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,833
- First of all, jake,
there's no records

531
00:16:25,877 --> 00:16:27,182
That you and i
teamed up together

532
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:28,836
Because you insisted that
we only communicate

533
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,621
Through a beeper.
- Stupid beepers.

534
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:32,274
We're right to be addicted
to our phones.

535
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:34,407
- Eyewitness saw you.
The dna's all over the scene.

536
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,497
And i caught you red-Handed
making a hostage video.

537
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,890
Your [bleep] is cooked.

538
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,195
- That's not a saying.
It's "goose."

539
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,371
- Who cares about a goose?

540
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:42,807
I'm talking about
cooking a penis.

541
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,025
- All right, this is pointless.

542
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,418
C.J. Will just
tell everyone the truth.

543
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,028
- No, he won't.
I bought him off.

544
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,421
All i gotta do is play
"madden" with him.

545
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,205
- Come on, c.J.
- Hey, you know what?

546
00:16:50,249 --> 00:16:51,598
I just beefed hard,
so i'm gonna let you

547
00:16:51,642 --> 00:16:54,340
Stew in here for a little while.
I am loving it.

548
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:57,343
[laughs]
such a loser.

549
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:59,214
[door slams]
- And this is rock bottom.

550
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:01,086
- Oh, raymond.
This is sad.

551
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,696
He's the one you think of
like a son, right?

552
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,177
Or are you closer to santiago?
Not that it matters.

553
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,483
They're both
equally going to prison.

554
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,224
- Oh, come on, madeline.
There's no need to gloat.

555
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,096
[laughing]
though, it does feel good.

556
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:12,358
Gloaty, gloat, gloat.

557
00:17:12,402 --> 00:17:14,360
- I knew i never should have
trusted you.

558
00:17:14,404 --> 00:17:17,407
- Yes, obviously not,
you dum-Dum.

559
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,234
John, you're gonna
wanna remember this.

560
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:20,671
Why don't you
snap a photo of him?

561
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:22,455
- Oh, yeah.

562
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,065
[shutter clicks]
yeah... [laughs]

563
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,197
- Why don't you
get in there with him?

564
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,459
- Oh, why the heck not?

565
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,418
My kids just got me
a digital picture frame.

566
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,898
- All right, everybody say,
"nine-Nine."

567
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:32,204
- Nine-Nine.
- Mm.

568
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,336
Raymond, i love the scowl,

569
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,251
But could you slump
your shoulders a bit more?

570
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:39,298
Remember—you're a man
who just lost everything.

571
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:42,127
And done.
[phone jingles]

572
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,000
We got it, peralta.
- Boom!

573
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:47,437
Are they totally shocked?

574
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,264
Is kelly like,
what just happened?

575
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:51,441
- What just happened?
- You've been had, john.

576
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:53,660
You see, when you handed me
your own locked phone

577
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:55,227
Just now to snap that photo,

578
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,098
I cloned it to
a secure network server.

579
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,622
- When you handed wuntch
your locked phone—

580
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:00,406
- Yeah, yeah.
I already said that part.

581
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,234
- Sorry.
I can't see or hear anything.

582
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:03,540
I'll just be quiet from now on.

583
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,932
I might chime in with a,
"yeah!" here and there

584
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:06,456
To stay in the mix.
- Great.

585
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,153
The only way to get you
to trust me is if you thought

586
00:18:08,196 --> 00:18:09,850
I was betraying holt.
- Yeah!

587
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:12,505
- And now i have access to all
your personal correspondence...

588
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,680
- All right!

589
00:18:13,724 --> 00:18:15,290
- Including all
stingray authorizations.

590
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,467
It's over, kelly.
You're done.

591
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,598
- Okay.

592
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,295
You may have won
this round, madeline,

593
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,123
But you're gonna
live to regret it.

594
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,604
You are both so gonna
live to regret it.

595
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:26,476
- I agree with
what was just said.

596
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,216
- Hey, jake?
I'm just gonna hold this down.

597
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,304
- Yeah, sounds good.
Thank you.

598
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:30,871
- When did you hatch this plan?

599
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,612
- Peralta thought of it when
i tried to quit the mission.

600
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:34,440
- Hey, what's holt's expression
right now?

601
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:36,311
Would you describe it as,
proud daddy?

602
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:37,835
- It's hard to tell.

603
00:18:37,878 --> 00:18:39,401
He's still piecing it together.
This could take a while.

604
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:42,317
- Why didn't you just tell me
what was actually happening?

605
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:43,667
- I wanted to, sir,

606
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,625
But it involved
trusting madeline wuntch,

607
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:47,627
And i just didn't think
you could handle it.

608
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:50,978
But i'm sorry that
i lied to you.

609
00:18:51,022 --> 00:18:53,111
Sir?
Sir?

610
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:54,286
Oh, no.
Is he mad?

611
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:56,375
I can't see anything.
Did he storm out?

612
00:18:56,418 --> 00:19:00,031
- No, i stormed in—
to tell you it was a great plan.

613
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,467
Nice work, peralta.

614
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:04,339
- And there it is—
the proud daddy.

615
00:19:04,383 --> 00:19:07,125
- Well, well, well.
Commissioner.

616
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:08,648
- Still not
used to hearing that.

617
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,258
Of course,
i'm only acting commissioner

618
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:11,782
Until they choose
someone permanent.

619
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:12,957
- Might well be you.

620
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,133
After all,
you brought down john kelly.

621
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,743
Wonder what he's doing now.

622
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:18,702
- He's got a much higher-Paying
job in the private sector.

623
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:21,139
- Yes, the world is horrible.
- Mm.

624
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:23,184
- But then again,
sometimes, it surprises you.

625
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,405
This whole time, i thought
you were up to something,

626
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:29,190
But really, you just wanted
what was right for the nypd.

627
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,975
- I did.

628
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:34,369
But also, i was up to something.

629
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:36,067
- Could i have
everyone's attention?

630
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,547
I know it's my last day,

631
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,811
And i've been in denial
about it all week.

632
00:19:40,854 --> 00:19:42,203
And i still am.

633
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,031
So, i'm giving this toast
for no reason.

634
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:45,250
Here's to nothing!
[laughs]

635
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,425
- You okay there, ter?

636
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:48,514
- It's just that,
if i wasn't in denial,

637
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:50,342
I would be so depressed
right now

638
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:52,344
At the thought of
leaving all of you.

639
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:54,520
- Yeah, we'd be depressed too—

640
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:57,131
If anything was happening,
which it isn't.

641
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,220
- Right,
and i'm not gonna say that

642
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,701
No matter what precinct number
is on your uniform,

643
00:20:01,745 --> 00:20:03,703
You will always
be part of the nine-Nine.

644
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:06,227
- It means so much to me you
aren't saying that right now.

645
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,273
- And i wanna say
i'm not gonna miss you at all,

646
00:20:08,316 --> 00:20:09,796
You piece of crap.
Good riddance.

647
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,581
- Pretty sure you're misreading
the game here, charles.

648
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:12,973
- Yeah.
I see that now.

649
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:14,627
- To nothing.
All: to nothing!

650
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,587
- Thanks, guys, but this sucks.
- Terry, come on.

651
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,110
We're still gonna see you
all the time.

652
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:20,285
I promise.

653
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:22,069
- You'll come visit me
in staten island?

654
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:24,506
- Yeah!
Or, you know,

655
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,813
You can come to brooklyn.
There's seven of us, one of you,

656
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,423
But we can iron out
the details later.

657
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,642
- Nobody's going
to staten island.

658
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,557
- Okay, damn, i get it.
I'll come to you.

659
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,646
- No, you're staying here
at the nine-Nine.

660
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,300
I just talked
to madeline wuntch.

661
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:36,693
She's making a personnel change,

662
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,259
Which frees up some room
in the budget.

663
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,218
- Really?
- What kind of personnel change?

664
00:20:40,261 --> 00:20:42,220
- I told her that
i'd only spent a month

665
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:44,004
As a patrolman
before i made detective.

666
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:45,440
She said
that's against regulations

667
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:49,270
And has decided to
rectify the situation.

668
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,185
- Rectify it how?

669
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:54,188
[whistle blowing]
