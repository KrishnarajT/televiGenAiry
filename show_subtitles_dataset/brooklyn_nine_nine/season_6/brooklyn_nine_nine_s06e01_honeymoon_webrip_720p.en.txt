00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,368
- I've just received the email
about whether I've gotten

2
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:08,847
the job as commissioner.

3
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,371
Well, from the look
on my face, I'm sure

4
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:12,242
you can guess what it says.

5
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:14,679
- No. We have no idea
at all.

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,333
Just tell us, you monster.

7
00:00:16,377 --> 00:00:17,682
No one noticed
the slight

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,903
tension in my labial
commissure?

9
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:22,948
My lips. I'm smiling.

10
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:24,428
- Wait, we're allowed to
say "labia" again?

11
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:25,690
- I got it.

12
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,952
Ohh!

13
00:00:26,996 --> 00:00:29,041
- Labia.
- Commissioner Raymond Holt.

14
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,608
- Labia.
- You gotta stop right now,

15
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,218
Hitchcock.
- We need to celebrate.

16
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:33,872
Ooh, we need music.

17
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,527
Ooh-ohh, ohh, I brought a
"Jock Jams" CD for the wedding.

18
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,224
- Oh, we didn't talk about
that.

19
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:40,183
- It was gonna be a surprise.
Our first dance was gonna be

20
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:41,402
the "Tootsee Roll."

21
00:00:41,445 --> 00:00:42,664
- Oh, no, and we didn't get to
do it.

22
00:00:42,707 --> 00:00:44,230
- I know. All right, nobody
move.

23
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:46,232
I'm gonna go get the CD.

24
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:47,756
- I want to thank you all.

25
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,888
What an incredible moment.

26
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:52,021
30 years of struggle and
sacrifice.

27
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:54,110
But it was worth it, because I
finally get to read

28
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:56,547
the ten words I've longed to
hear:

29
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,985
"Raymond Holt, you are not
the"--oops.

30
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,073
I misread the email.

31
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:02,988
Didn't see the "not."

32
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:04,163
- So...

33
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:07,384

commissioner.

called "wedding insurance."

62
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,149
- It's very common.

63
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:18,542
It's like renter's insurance.

It's a dump, and anyone who
goes there is garbage.

Money really changes you.

Isn't that the place that Gina

rewards points?

82
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:52,141
- Why, yes, it is.

00:02:52,184 --> 00:02:53,969
Don't forget to use code GINA30
at checkout.

84
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:56,101

and super fancy.

And when we're there, there's
only one rule.

Always be coconuting.

At all times, we will either be
drinking from, eating,

89
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,721
or wearing a coconut.

90
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,030
- Oh, this place is amazing.

91
00:03:12,074 --> 00:03:13,684
I've never had sex outside the
United States.

92
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:14,729
What are you thinking about?

93
00:03:14,772 --> 00:03:16,426
- Weirdly, the same thing.

94
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:17,862
- Whoa.
- Welcome to paradise.

95
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,429
Margarita?
- Yes, I would love one.

96
00:03:19,472 --> 00:03:22,998
But is there any way you could
put it in a coconut?

97
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,216
- It will be my pleasure, sir.

98
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,653
- Oh, thank you.

99
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:27,655
I requested a ridiculous thing,
and he's doing it.

100
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:29,613
Quick, think of more stupid
stuff we can ask for.

101
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:30,875
- Grapes.
Sorry, I panicked.

102
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,050
And I couldn't think of
anything.

103
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:33,399
- No, no, no, grapes is
perfect.

104
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,053
Excuse me, sir, is there any
way

105
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:36,620
you could get my wife some
grapes?

106
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,361
- Yes, sir, right away.
- He's running.

107
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:40,189
He's running for the grapes.

108
00:03:40,232 --> 00:03:41,277
- Here are your drinks

109
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,410
and a lovers' toolbox from a
Mr. Boyle.

110
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:45,455
- Ah, thank you so much.

111
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:46,587
We will never open this.

112
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,631
- Oh, my God, Jake, look.

113
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,285
- Yes, the grapes.

114
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,373
Oh, and you brought cheese.

115
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,461
I don't even want cheese.

116
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,071
- No, Jake, in the lounge.

117
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,600
- Ay caramba.

118
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:04,605
- You can't do that in person.

119
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:06,432
It's Charles.

120
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:07,651
Boyle. Your coworker.

121
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:09,131
- Oh, hey, Charles.

122
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:11,612
- I just found out that
your mom left my dad.

123
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:12,787
They're getting divorced.

124
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,049
- Eh, they had a good run.

125
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,920
Fun fact: The average American
marriage

126
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,313
lasts fewer than two days.

127
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:19,097
- That's not true.
- It doesn't have to be.

128
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,533
It's commentary.

129
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:21,883
- Well, you know who didn't
think it was a good run?

130
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:23,449
My daddy, Lynn Boyle.

131
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:24,668
He's inconsolable.

132
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:25,887
- Well, I'm sure he'll get over
it.

133
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,671
- No, Boyles don't "get over
it."

134
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:29,064
It becomes part of us.

135
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:31,240
It lives within us.
It eats us out.

136
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:32,894
We have to get them back
together.

137
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:34,286
- Pass.
- Well, I'm doing it with

138
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,027
or without your help.
- Okay, without.

139
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,638
- Okay, you called my bluff.
It has to be with your help.

140
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:38,813
And I'm not taking no for an
answer.

141
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:39,814
- No.
- Okay, you did it again.

142
00:04:39,857 --> 00:04:41,119
Why are you like this?

143
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,339
- I don't know.

144
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,515
- Hey, Sarge, I have a problem,
and I would ask Holt,

145
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:49,084
but since he's not back...
- You came to Top Dog Terry.

146
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:50,302
Smart move.

147
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,696
I've been solving problems
all day long.

148
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:55,960
- Okay, so you know that
meth case I've been working on

149
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,440
for the last two months?

150
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,224
The Department of Sanitation
police want to poach it

151
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:00,748
from me, because the drugs were
found in a dumpster.

152
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:01,966
They're saying
it's garbage-related.

153
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,924
- This is an easy one.

154
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,447
Tell them to screw off.

155
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,492
See? Problem solved.

156
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,147
- Yeah, well, I did that,
and they threatened to make

157
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,714
a formal complaint to the
mayor.

158
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:11,759
- Then just let them have the
case.

159
00:05:11,802 --> 00:05:13,108
Problem solved.

160
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:15,806
- Terry, I've been working
on it for two months,

161
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,416
and those dummies are gonna
blow it.

162
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,769
- Right. Well, you could
partner up with sanitation.

163
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,509
Problem solved

164
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:24,597
- Nope. Headquarters won't
allow it

165
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,816
due to budgetary reasons.

166
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,862
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

167
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:29,994
- You know, Captain Holt was
writing an instruction manual

168
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,996
for his replacement in case he
was named commissioner.

169
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,041
Maybe he could tell you what to
do.

170
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,695
- That's not necessary.

171
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:36,740
Top Dog Terry can make
a decision.

172
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:43,442
Does Top Dog Terry want a
moment to think about it?

173
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:45,227
- Woof-woof.

174
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,359
- Since the rejection, a great
sadness has enveloped me.

175
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,622
I kept expecting this
dark feeling to pass,

176
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,841
but it's only gotten worse.

177
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,538
- Not getting the job you want
stinks.

178
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:54,976
In first grade, I was passed
over for line leader,

179
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,629
and I'm still pissed.

180
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:59,589
Kyle D.'s lines had curves
and gaps and cutting galore.

181
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,895
It was a frickin' carnival.

182
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:03,941
- Well, it's not just that I
didn't get the job.

183
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,377
It's that John Kelly did.

184
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:07,728
He's already released
a memo detailing his

185
00:06:07,771 --> 00:06:09,381
"vigilant policing"
initiative.

186
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:11,253
It's essentially a return
to stop and frisk.

187
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:14,952
Choosing him is a betrayal
of everything I stand for.

188
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,780
- I feel the same way about
Kyle D.

189
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:18,782
- I tried to suck it up and go
back to work.

190
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:20,349
I put on my uniform
and got in my car.

191
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:23,787
And next thing I knew, I was on
a plane to Mexico.

192
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,528
I didn't even pack a bag.

193
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,835
I bought a bundle of novelty
shirts at a nearby gift shop.

194
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,488
This one says, "What's up,
beaches?"

195
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:32,056
Instead of "bitches"
for humor reasons.

196
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,319
- But you hate humor.
- Well, I'm a joke now,

197
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:35,930
so it suits me.

198
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:39,455
- Mm-kay. But, how did
you end up here in Mexico

199
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,892
at the exact same tiny resort
as us?

200
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,894
- Gina's been talking up
this place up for years.

201
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:45,809
both: Referral Code GINA30.

202
00:06:45,853 --> 00:06:48,029
- I had no idea you'd be here.

203
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:49,682
It's fine, sir.

204
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,641
A lot of people go on their
honeymoon with their boss.

205
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:52,990
Nope, I thought if I said it
out loud

206
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:54,035
it would normalize it,
but it's weird.

207
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:55,079
- It's gonna be okay.

208
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,341
How long are you staying, sir?

209
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:57,952
- Just until I get my head
right.

210
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:00,606
But don't worry.
I'll steer clear of you two.

211
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,043
You won't even know I'm here.

212
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:04,610
- This place is so romantic.

213
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:07,918
- Yeah, and so... intimate.

214
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,312
- Don't worry.
I'm not listening to you.

215
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:13,010
I'm just thinking about how
this sea bass is cold

216
00:07:13,054 --> 00:07:15,317
but not as cold and cruel as
the hands of fate

217
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,930
that have thrust my entire life
into darkness.

218
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,453
- Ah, damn it.

219
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:23,412
I just ordered the sea bass.

220
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,330
- Ahh, babe, this is so nice.

221
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:29,766
There are hot stones on our
butts for no reason.

222
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,854
- Not on mine.

223
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,508
My butt stones keep falling
off,

224
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:33,552
because I'm so tense about
Holt being here

225
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:34,858
and ruining everything.

226
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:37,861
- It hasn't been that bad.

227
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:39,602
- Oops. Sorry.

228
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:41,386
Can't even float right.

229
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,866
Just push me away.

230
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,650
Everyone else does.

231
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:48,306
- It's not great, but as long
as we stay in here, we're safe.

232
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,004
- Peralta, Santiago,
I'm in your room.

233
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,570
How?

234
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:52,745
- Patio door was open
I pushed through the hedge.

235
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:54,573
Tell me,
what is it about me

236
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:56,358
that screams loser?

237
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:57,925
- Yeah, you know,
we're kind of in the middle

238
00:07:57,968 --> 00:07:59,622
of getting massages right now,
sir.

239
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:01,058
- Oh, how thoughtless of me.

240
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:02,973
I'll get down here so you can
see my face.

241
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:04,409
- Oh, no, that's...

242
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:07,586
- Hello. The question
was, what is it about me

243
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,068
that screams loser?

244
00:08:11,112 --> 00:08:14,115
- I can't figure out what went
wrong between our parents.

245
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:15,594
They were so in love.

246
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:17,161
- Oh, okay, so we're having
a conversation?

247
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,641
- No, to get them back
together,

248
00:08:18,684 --> 00:08:19,947
we need to know what happened.
Did your mom tell you?

249
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,035
- Nope.
- Damn it.

250
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,558
Okay, let's brainstorm.

251
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,212
It could be that my dad is too
clingy or too masculine.

252
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,170
I'm going
to play a game on my phone

253
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,780
while you go on this
little journey.

254
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:30,348
- He overshares,
he's indecisive,

255
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:31,654
he's always crying.

256
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:32,698
- Oh, I made it inside the
temple.

257
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:34,265
- He wears a kimono a lot.

258
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,788
- I became a hawk.
I have talons.

259
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:37,094
- Well, he can't keep a secret.

260
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:38,791
He has a clinically loose
pelvis.

261
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,663
- Okay, that did break through.
I heard "loose pelvis."

262
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:42,012
Charles, you've got to stop.

263
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,492
It's none of those things.

264
00:08:43,535 --> 00:08:44,885
- Wait. You said your
mom didn't tell you anything.

265
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,495
Do you know what happened?
- Yes, I do.

266
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:47,931
And it's none of your business,
Charles.

267
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:50,455
Just stop sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

268
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:51,935
- Really, Gina.

269
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:55,460
And where does my nose belong
if not inside our parents?

270
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:56,809
- Okay, so we can get away
from Holt.

271
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,246
I mean, should we tell him to
leave,

272
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,247
that he's ruining our
honeymoon?

273
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,726
- No, we can't.

274
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,816
That would crush him, and
he's already so crushed.

275
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,209
Wait, I got it.

276
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,210
- We kill Holt.

277
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,777
- No.

278
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,474
- No, that was crazy for a
multitude of reasons.

279
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,476
- We have a bunch of fun
activities planned.

280
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,740
If we include him, it'll cheer
him up, and he'll leave.

281
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:17,134
- Right, but aren't most
of our activities

282
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:18,657
kind of geared towards couples?

283
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,964
- Name one couples' activity
that wouldn't be more fun

284
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,226
with your boss there.

285
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,793
- Welcome to Sensual Food
Tasting:

286
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:25,969
The Art of Feeding Your Lover.

287
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,666
- I feel like I don't
belong here.

288
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,974
- Mm, I love how the mud
revitalizes your skin.

289
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:33,629
- And I love how it
masks my shame.

290
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:35,500
- I am loving this.

291
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:37,720
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

292
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:38,982
- Mmm.

293
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:40,810
This is actually quite
pleasant.

294
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,160
You know, when you invited
me to join you today,

295
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,379
I was skeptical.

296
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:45,989
I had been
sitting by the pool

297
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:48,992
contentedly watching a bee
struggle to avoid drowning

298
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:51,560
and thinking to myself how I
am like that bee.

299
00:09:51,603 --> 00:09:52,953
Man, I hope it survived.

300
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:54,563
We can't afford to lose
any more bees.

301
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:56,043
- It didn't. The
point is that I am glad

302
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:57,696
you included me into
your frivolous activities.

303
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,481
You helped me to remember
there's more to life

304
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:00,743
than the NYPD.

305
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:03,050
- Wow, that's great to hear,
sir.

306
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:04,181
- I feel a lot better.

307
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,748
I think I may be heading home.

308
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,706
Unless you need a third
for tonight's activities.

309
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,273
- What are we...
- Sensual pottery.

310
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,883
- I think we're good.

311
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,624
- Sarge, I keep getting calls
about my drug case from—

312
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,017
what the hell is going on?

313
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,237
- Nothing. Just deciding
what to do about

314
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,804
your sanitation issue,
like a boss.

315
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:20,154
- You're looking for Captain
Holt's manual aren't you?

316
00:10:20,197 --> 00:10:21,938
- Please, Diaz.

317
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:24,723
Top Dog Terry does not need to
look for Captain Holt's manual.

318
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,160
He knows it's on his computer.

319
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:27,857
Top Dog Terry was looking for
the password.

320
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,902
- Why don't you just
make your own decision?

321
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:32,035
- I did that, and I'm
very proud of it.

322
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,819
I just want to make sure
Captain Holt would make

323
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:35,908
the same decision so I can be
proud of him too.

324
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:38,128
Gina. Do you know
Captain Holt's password?

325
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,826
- Oh, Terry, just because
I know all your passwords

326
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,654
doesn't mean I know
Captain Holt's.

327
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:44,047
- Okay, well, we could probably
guess it.

328
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:47,007
- Why don't you try
BaldByChoice or PecMan

329
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,921
or MacklemoreEnthusiast?

330
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:51,881
- Stop saying my passwords.
Damn, Gina.

331
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:53,361
Now Terry's got to update
his keychain.

332
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,232
- Start simple. Kevin
with a capital K

333
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,407
and a 1 instead of an I

334
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:57,974
- Oh, I feel good about that.

335
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:02,718
Locked out?
Too many failed attempts?

336
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,894
I only guessed once.

337
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:08,071
Computer will now delete hard
drive?

338
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,681
I've got to fix this.

339
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,424
- Good. You fixed it.

340
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,947
- He's leaving. Our plan
worked.

341
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,601
- We saved our own honeymoon,
and fun bonus,

342
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,081
we cheered up Holt.
- Yes.

343
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,517
Okay, it's time to celebrate.

344
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:21,084
You know what that means.

345
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:23,130
This B needs a C in her A.

346
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:24,653
- Oh, my God.

347
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:25,958
- This babe needs a coconut in
her arms.

348
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:28,918
- Oh, I thought you
were saying

349
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,572
this needs a
in her.

350
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:32,095
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that was my reaction.

351
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,618
All right, I'll go get us a
couple of coconuts.

352
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:35,272
Ahh, hey there, Captain.

353
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:37,144
Haven't seen you looking this
happy since they picked up

354
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:39,059
"The Durrells in Corfu"
for a fourth season.

355
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:41,713
- Yes, well, I've reached the
best part of every vacation:

356
00:11:41,757 --> 00:11:43,150
reviewing the charges.

357
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:44,629
- Well, don't let me interrupt.
Have a safe flight.

358
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:46,283
And I'll see you back at the
Nine-Nine.

359
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:47,850
- No, you won't; I'll never be
going back there again.

360
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:49,852
Why?
I'm confused.

361
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:52,289
- You and Amy made me see that
there's more to life

362
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:56,032
than the NYPD, so I'm quitting.

363
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,816
- Oh.

364
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,994
Well...
what a satisfying result

365
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:05,085
that we all were hoping would
occur.

366
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:10,438
- Hold on. So let's just back
up a second.

367
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,135
When you say you're quitting,
you mean quitting

368
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,397
for, like, a couple of weeks,
and then you'll come back

369
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,833
Jordan-style with a new badge
number?

370
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:16,531
- No, I mean, quitting
permanently,

371
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:18,185
I'm putting in my resignation
as soon as I get back home.

372
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,316
I better hurry if I want to be
at the airport

373
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,839
six hours ahead of my flight.

374
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:23,407
I should drive you there.

375
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,017
Will you come with me to grab
my keys from the room?

376
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:29,196
Okay, they're just right in
here, so...

377
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:32,242
You're not leaving this room.

378
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:35,071
- I can't let you quit.

379
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:38,335
- Yes, but why the candles
and rose petals?

380
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:40,555
- Wuh-oh.

381
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:44,776
'Cause someone's about to Die
Harrr—oh, my God.

382
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,169
Why is Captain Holt here?

383
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:47,910
Because he's gonna—wait,
are you dressed like

384
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:49,129
Bonnie Bedelia in "Die Hard?"

385
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:50,565
- I am.

386
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:52,175
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

387
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,004
- Because he's quitting the
force,

388
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:56,440
so I brought him
to convince him not to,

389
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,094
but obviously
that is not important anymore.

390
00:12:58,138 --> 00:12:59,661
All right, Captain, it's been a
good run.

391
00:12:59,704 --> 00:13:01,489
Thank you for teaching me the
importance of a tie

392
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:02,925
in the workplace, and the door
is right over here.

393
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,100
You're quitting?

394
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:06,102
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

395
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:07,756
We're keeping you right here.

396
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,453
Physically restrain me?

397
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,759
- Great idea.

398
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,064
Is there anything in Charles'
box of nightmares

399
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:14,328
that could be used to tie up
Holt?

400
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,721
- Yes. Literally everything in
here could be used

401
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,201
to tie up a person.

402
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,769
- Wow, Terry, put Captain
Holt's computer back together?

403
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:22,336
Looks great.
- Sure did.

404
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:24,686
Couldn't find room inside for
this stuff, though.

405
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,688
- Well, is there any chance
the info on in computer

406
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:28,124
was maybe saved to the cloud?

407
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:29,865
- I don't know.

408
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:32,476
Gina, was Captain Holt's hard
drive backed up to the cloud?

409
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,174
- Yeah.
- Then why did you let me try

410
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:35,218
to rebuild his computer?

411
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:36,872
- Because I'm a rascal.

412
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:40,745
- Okay, so I just log
onto the cloud as Captain Holt

413
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:43,400
and click "forgot password"

414
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:45,576
and answer his security
questions.

415
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,536
First up: What is God?

416
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,798
- Hey, Gina.

417
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:51,539
Did you see "Real Housewives"
last night?

418
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:54,194
If she says no, then ask about
"Below Deck."

419
00:13:55,673 --> 00:13:57,153
- She's getting suspicious,
Scully. Act natural.

420
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,852
- Tell her no. Scully, stop
saying what I'm saying.

421
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:02,767
Be normal.

422
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,161
- Damn it, Gina.

423
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:06,771
What does it look like I'm
doing?

424
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,599
I'm trying to unlock your phone
using a mask of your face

425
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:10,732
so I can find out why your mom
left my dad.

426
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:12,081
- Charles, give me my phone.

427
00:14:12,124 --> 00:14:14,605
- Okay, fine.

428
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,173
- Boom, unlocked it.
- Give me my phone, Charles.

429
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:19,175
- Not until I find out or
parents are breaking up.

430
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:20,785
- Give it.
- Scrolling, scrolling.

431
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:22,526
- Give me my phone, you idiot.
- You were the reason.

432
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,485
You sent her a text that says,
"You should divorce him"?

433
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:27,009
- Okay, yeah, but that's open
to interpretation.

434
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:28,445
- No, but then she says, "I
don't want to,"

435
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:30,230
and then you say, "But you have
to.

436
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:31,927
"Leave him now, and divorce
him.

437
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,407
Don't tell him why."

438
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,672
- Okay, yeah, you did interpret
it correctly.

439
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:40,065
- Shame, shame.

440
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:41,589
- I'm so sorry I brought Holt
back here.

441
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,504
I had no idea you were doing
this whole "Die Hard" thing.

442
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,288
Man, you really got the hair
exactly right.

443
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:47,595
Did you contact the onset hair
stylist, Paul Abascal?

444
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:48,987
- No, this is a wig.

445
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:50,815
- Oh, that's cool too.
So here's what I'm thinking.

446
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:52,687
We let Holt go, I have sex with
Holly Gennaro but hotter.

447
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,167
The squad handles the captain,
or disbands, whatever,

448
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,691
we have sex again—

449
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:58,432
- Okay, stop suggesting that.
We need to stay focused.

450
00:14:58,475 --> 00:14:59,998
- Right.
- Holt it fragile.

451
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,478
We need to be gentle, okay?

452
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,001
Just follow my lead.
- With pleasure.

453
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,438
I love the view.
I'm sorry.

454
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:06,527
This outfit is driving me
insane.

455
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,356
- Hello, sir. Sorry again for
tying you spread eagle

456
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,184
on the bed.
- Apology not accepted.

457
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,404
- Look, I know you're upset,
but this isn't

458
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,667
your last chance to become
commissioner.

459
00:15:16,711 --> 00:15:17,929
John Kelly's old.

460
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:19,366
He's not gonna be in office
forever.

461
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,932
- True, but he'll just
be replaced by another

462
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,282
mediocre old white man.

463
00:15:22,325 --> 00:15:23,674
Nothing will ever change.

464
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,676
- All right, well, what
about all your goals

465
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,112
for the Nine

466
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:28,505
You still have so much left to
accomplish.

467
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:29,811
- Wrong, I've
accomplished everything

468
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:31,160
that I set out to do.

469
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:32,683
I wanted to reduce crime, and
I did.

470
00:15:32,727 --> 00:15:34,206
There's no crime in Brooklyn
anymore.

471
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,643
- Seems like a bit of a
stretch.

472
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:37,514
- What about improving
community relations?

473
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:39,037
- Done. Everyone loves
the police.

474
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,561
It's embarrassing.

475
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,127
- Way off. All right, Ame, step
aside; I got this.

476
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:43,999
Captain, what about the
Halloween Heist?

477
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:46,175
- I'll just come in and win it
and then go back to my house.

478
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:47,916
- Damn it. I'm out.
- Jake.

479
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:50,048
- All right, fine, sir, do you
know why I love coming to work?

480
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:51,833
- Because there's a bumper
pool table in the break room.

481
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:53,661
- Yes, obviously I love
the bumper pool table.

482
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,490
But do you want to know
another reason why?

483
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,882
You.

484
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,057
You've made me a better cop.

485
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:00,450
You've made me a better person.

486
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,713
I've learned so much from you.

487
00:16:02,757 --> 00:16:04,802
So you can't quit.

488
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:07,414
Because I need you.

489
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:10,155
- Oh, please. How selfish.

490
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,418
- That little speech you just
gave.

491
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:13,245
It was all about you and
what you need.

492
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,335
How unbelievably selfish.

493
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:17,337
- Okay, well, I don't want
to get mad right now,

494
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,208
'cause Amy is worried
about you, so—

495
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,036
- No, screw that noise.

496
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,733
How dare you call Jake selfish?

497
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:25,257
He just wasted his entire
honeymoon

498
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,085
trying to take care of you
while you wallowed

499
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:28,913
in your misery like a little
baby.

500
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:31,133
- That seems a little harsh.

501
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,743
I don't give a hoot.
- Oh, damn.

502
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:34,919
- For the last five years,
all I've done is

503
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:37,705
give a hoot about you
and what you think.

504
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:39,576
I gave a hoot about
you as a boss.

505
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,143
I gave a hoot about
you as a mentor.

506
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:43,014
I gave a hoot about
you as a friend.

507
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:44,625
- She gave so many hoots.

508
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:46,627
- Not anymore.
After the way you've acted

509
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,107
and what you just said to
Jake, I don't give a hoot,

510
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,892
what you think,
and I really don't

511
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:54,417
give a hoot if you decide
to quit the NYPD, so do it.

512
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,766
I'm all out of hoots.

513
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,378
I'm hootless.

514
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:00,292
- Now, what I want to say is—
Jake.

515
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:01,642
- Coming Holly Gennaro.

516
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:07,865
- Hey, I thought piña coladas
might be too festive,

517
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:09,127
so I got two super-depressing
coconuts filled with merlot.

518
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:11,303
- I'm not depressed.
I'm relieved.

519
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:14,437
For the first time all week,
it's just the two of us.

520
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,917
- I'm right here.

521
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,745
I escaped using some of the
lube Boyle sent you.

522
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,399
It got everywhere.
I had to change.

523
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:22,489
- Yeah, and your new shirt is
very aggressive and confusing.

524
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:23,707
Is the pineapple the slut,

525
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,056
or is it calling someone else a
slut?

526
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,797
- Clearly the pineapple is the
slut.

527
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,320
- Huh.
- Look, I wanted to say

528
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:29,626
I'm sorry.

529
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,411
Maybe find someone who gives a
hoot.

530
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:33,064
Try an owl cage.

531
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:35,415
- Oh, honey, I love you,
but not your best.

532
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,721
- Look, you have every right
not to accept my apology,

533
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,854
but at least hear it first.

534
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:41,638
I'm sorry I said Jake was
selfish.

535
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:43,335
I'm sorry I ruined your
honeymoon.

536
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:46,208
I'm sorry I interrupted your
"Die Hard"-themed sexcapades.

537
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:49,037
- You don't have to
list everything; it's cool.

538
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,040
- Right. I thought if
I played by the NYPD's rules

539
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,303
and didn't make any waves, one
day I would rise to a position

540
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:56,261
where I could make meaningful
change.

541
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:59,308
When they hired John Kelly, I
realized I was wrong,

542
00:17:59,351 --> 00:18:01,266
and I thought I was
out of options.

543
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,268
But then you tied me
to your bed, legs akimbo,

544
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:07,359
and made me realize there was
another way.

545
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:09,623
I could not give a hoot.

546
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,711
- Wow, the hoot thing
is catching on.

547
00:18:10,754 --> 00:18:12,277
Didn't see that coming.

548
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:13,844
- I'm going to go directly
to the mayor and tell him

549
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:16,281
John Kelly's "vigilant
policing" proposal

550
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:17,935
is regressive and
counter-productive,

551
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:20,285
and if he implements it, I'm
gonna make

552
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:22,070
a big stink in the press.

553
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:23,898
- Going over the commissioner
and threatening the mayor, sir?

554
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:25,595
Don't you think that'll
piss him off?

555
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,468
- I don't give a hoot.

556
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:30,078
Listen, I'm on the next plane
back,

557
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,167
but I wanted to pay for you two
to extend your stay

558
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,386
so you can have a proper
honeymoon.

559
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,388
- Oh, sir, thank you.

560
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:38,216
That's very nice, right, Jake?

561
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,391
- Yeah, super cool.

562
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:41,002
Just out of curiosity asking
for a friend,

563
00:18:41,045 --> 00:18:43,047
where did you get the shirt,
and how much did it cost?

564
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:45,136
- Ooh, you're still wearing the
mask?

565
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,183
- Yeah, to hide my sadness.
I'll take it off.

566
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:49,663
- No, don't.

567
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:51,491
For some reason, it's easier to
care about what you say

568
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,057
when you look like me.

569
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:54,755
- Why did you tell your
mom to leave my dad, Gina?

570
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:56,800
Is it so bad being a Boyle?

571
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,803
- Yes, it terrible, but that's
not why I did it.

572
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,457
My mom was cheating on your
dad,

573
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,067
so I told her she had to break
it off.

574
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:04,547
Why didn't you tell me?

575
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:06,331
- Because I didn't want
to hurt you or him.

576
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,986
She was being disgusting, so I
told her she had to end it.

577
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,335
- You were trying to protect
us.

578
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:11,989
Gina, you were actually being
sweet.

579
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,165
- Uh-doi.

580
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:16,167
- Not good.

581
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,256
I'm reading this book on
religion, and apparently

582
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,302
there's some debate as to what
God is.

583
00:19:20,345 --> 00:19:21,303
- Don't worry about it.

584
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:22,783
Gina had the manual.

585
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:23,871
Why didn't she just give it to
me?

586
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,612
- 'Cause she's a rascal.

587
00:19:25,655 --> 00:19:27,135
Look at what it says.

588
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:29,485
- "Never use italics, lest
people think you are

589
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:30,921
a con-man or a clown."

590
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:32,836
I'm not sure
how this applies here.

591
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,490
- No. Under that.

592
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:36,797
- "If you are unsure
of what to do in any situation,

593
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,800
consult Sergeant Jeffords."

594
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:42,106
I trust him completely."

595
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,630
Well, that's a
kick in the butt.

596
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:48,548
- Tell sanitation you'll
work the case together.

597
00:19:48,591 --> 00:19:50,941
You're the primary, and HQ can
take it out

598
00:19:50,985 --> 00:19:52,160
of the supplemental budget.

599
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:54,075
I'll find the room.
- Cool.

600
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:56,207
Top Dog Terry's back.

601
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:01,473
- Mm-hmm.

602
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:02,866
- Hello.

603
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,564
- Oh, my God.

604
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:05,782
Are you Melvil Dewey?

605
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:07,175
- Indeed I am.

606
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:09,525
I invented the Dewey decimal
system,

607
00:20:09,569 --> 00:20:13,573
but right now I'm working on
the Do-me decimal system.

608
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:14,661
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

609
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:15,705
This is really working for me.

610
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:16,837
- Yeah.

611
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,534
- Awesome.
- So, Mr. Dewey,

612
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:20,884
can you save me from the
terrorists that have taken over

613
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:21,885
Nakatomi Plaza?

614
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,626
- Yes, Holly Gennaro,

615
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,762
I just need file them in the
library... card... catalog.

616
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:29,893
- Yeah, this is really hard to
track.

617
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,329
Let's just take our clothes
off.

618
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:32,635
- Oh, thank God.
This old jacket is so hot.

619
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:33,941
- Yeah.

620
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,507
That was magical.

621
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,727
I can't believe we're back.
- I refuse to accept it.

622
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:38,989
I'm still coconuting.

623
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,382
This is filled with coffee.

624
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:41,426
It is very hot.

625
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,863
Coconut is not a good
insulator.

626
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:44,734
- No, it's not.

627
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,170
Captain.
- Peralta, Santiago,

628
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:47,737
how was the end of the
honeymoon?

629
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:49,086
- It was amazing.

630
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,262
Not to brag, but I saw a sea
turtle.

631
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:52,612
- Kind of sounds like
you're bragging, babe.

632
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:54,091
- I was.
It looked right at me.

633
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,658
Did you contact the mayor?

634
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,486
- Yes. I voiced my concerns
as soon as I got back.

635
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,401
He heard me out, and he's put
John Kelly's

636
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:01,316
"vigilant policing" initiative
under review.

637
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,927
- Way to go, No Hoots Holt.

638
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,668
- Very much so.

639
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:08,584
To retaliate, he closed the
bottom floor of the Nine-Nine

640
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:09,977
for renovations indefinitely.

641
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,631
Everyone's been moved
to our bullpen.

642
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:15,373
- Prepare yourselves.

643
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,073
The Nine-Nine is at war with
the NYPD.

644
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:23,164
both: Ay caramba.

645
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:25,383
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

646
00:21:25,427 --> 00:21:27,472
- Fremulon.
