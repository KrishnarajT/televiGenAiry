1
00:00:04,646 --> 00:00:06,909
- Peralta, looks like
an old friend of yours

2
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:08,694
is back in town.
- Who?

3
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:10,565
That guy Neil that you
bunked with at sleepaway camp?

4
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:12,393
- Oh, Neil from camp
was the best.

5
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:14,047
He could pick up a milk carton
with his butt cheeks.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,657
He was so funny.

7
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,572
- You know who else was funny?
Bill Cosby.

8
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:19,705
- Charles, will you relax?
You're gonna love Neil.

9
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:21,272
- It's not Neil.
Why would it be Neil?

10
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:23,535
It's Doug Judy.
- Oh, right.

11
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:24,884
Someone we all know
in a police capacity.

12
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:26,668
That makes more sense.

13
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:28,801
- Someone's using his
signature move to steal cars,

14
00:00:28,844 --> 00:00:30,411
plugging in to the OBD port

15
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:32,326
and reprogramming
the immobilizer module.

16
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,762
- That's Doug Judy's MO,
but it's not him.

17
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,460
He told me he went legit.
- That's what he told you

18
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,418
last time too,
before he screwed you over.

19
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:38,985
- Yeah, but he returned
the diamonds to me eventually,

20
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:40,421
and it turned out
that was the only way

21
00:00:40,465 --> 00:00:41,770
to get Giggle Pig
off the streets.

22
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:42,815
Wait, I may be confusing
our adventures.

23
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,425
What year was the cruise?

24
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:46,079
- Dude's a criminal.
People don't change.

25
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:47,863
- Ever heard of Bruce Banner,
the Incredible Hulk?

26
00:00:47,907 --> 00:00:49,343
You might want to talk
to his shirts and pants

27
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:51,693
about people not changing.

28
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:53,608
- Well, I want to ask Doug Judy
some questions.

29
00:00:53,652 --> 00:00:54,957
You have his number?

30
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,655
- I always make contact
through his mom.

31
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:58,309
I'll put you in touch with her,
but remember,

32
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:00,441
she thinks I'm his assistant
Mangy Carl,

33
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:02,443
and he's a famous architect
who's designing

34
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:04,619
LeBron James' new school
for black astronauts.

35
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:08,362
- Hello, Mrs. Judy?

36
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:10,582
I'm looking for your son,
the architect.

37
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,062
Yes, I'm from...
black NASA.

38
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,063
Is that a thing?

39
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,457
- Oh, my. I didn't know.

40
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,634
I understand.
Good-bye.

41
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:22,507
So Doug Judy
will not be coming in.

42
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,508
- What?
Why not?

43
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:25,379
Oh, I see.

44
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:26,859
He is dead.

45
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:49,751
Wow, I don't know how to deal
with all these emotions, Terry.

46
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,710
No one I've been close with
has ever died before.

47
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:54,539
No tragic accidents to friends.
All my grandparents are alive.

48
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,018
- How did you deal
when Hodor died?

49
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:58,673
- Not well, Terry.
Why would you bring that up?

50
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:00,893
- Carl?
Mangy Carl?

51
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:02,982
- Yes. That is me.

52
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:05,027
- I'm Trudy Judy,
Doug's sister.

53
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,594
This is our aunt Patrice.

54
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:07,987
I'm so glad you could make it.

55
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,597
Doug really loved you.

56
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:12,731
- Oh, he talked about me?
- Oh, all the time.

57
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:15,690
He was so afraid he'd fall back
into your old life.

58
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,388
Doug made Mangy Carl
an assistant

59
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:18,824
at the architecture firm.

60
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,869
He rescued him
from a life on the streets.

61
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:23,481
- Yeah, I was down on my luck,
not a penny to my name.

62
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:24,786
- You were selling your body
for money.

63
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,961
- Did Doug tell you that?

64
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,528
- He said all your teeth
fell out,

65
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:29,051
and your mouth was just
a rotten hole.

66
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,879
- 100% accurate.

67
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:33,012
- Plus you were sick from
those back-alley butt implants.

68
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:35,057
- Had to have 'em.
- Carl thought a plumper rump

69
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,190
would help him get his
every night.

70
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,931
- Yeah, I remember having
that thought.

71
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:41,150
- But the doctor just put
a bunch of mulch up there,

72
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,196
and it got all infected.
- Dark days.

73
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,547
- I'm sorry.
It's just so sweet.

74
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,202
- The mulch thing?
- No, how Doug saved him.

75
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:52,205
Doug was always taking people
under his wing.

76
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:54,555
Doug said you have
a beautiful voice.

77
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,948
- Oh, he did?
Well, I...

♪ Suppose that's true

79
00:02:57,689 --> 00:02:59,691
- Would you want to sing a song

80

- What a nice thought,
but you know what,

81
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,737
I don't have anything prepared.

82
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:04,217
- Okay, well,
if you don't want to sing,

83
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,045
you could just tell us
the inspiring story

84
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,917
of how Doug saved you
from being a mulch-butt ho.

85
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:11,790
- I would like to sing a song
in honor of my dear friend

86
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,182
Doug Judy.

87
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,097
- Oh, nothing better
after a long shift

88
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:16,838
than coming to Shaw's.

89
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:18,884
It's like Cheers, where
everybody knows your name.

90
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,538
- A place where everybody
knows your name is hell.

91
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,931
You're describing hell.
- Guys, guys, guys.

92
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:24,237
Are those...

93
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,673
all: Firefighters.

94
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:26,979
- Hey, what's going on?

95
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:28,633
Why is the FDNY in our cop bar?

96
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,982
- We needed a new place,

97
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,897
since our bar, O'Brien's,
burned down.

98
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,638
- You couldn't put that out?
- They probably started it.

99
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,509
Most arsonists turn out
to be firefighters.

100
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:37,511
- That's not true,
though it is very common,

101
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:38,947
and definitely what happened
in this case.

102
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:40,253
- I'm surprised you guys
even want to come here

103
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:41,733
since you have to take
the stairs.

104
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:43,604
I know how much you like
sliding on poles.

105
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,040
- We don't like sliding
on poles.

106
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,086
We do it to save lives.
It's dangerous.

107
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:48,609
You can ask my best friend
Steve.

108
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:50,568
Oh, no, wait,
you can't, actually,

109
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,047
because he's dead.

110
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:53,614
Tripped through a pole hole,
broke his neck.

111
00:03:53,658 --> 00:03:55,050
- That's horrible.

112
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:56,965
- Sorry, but this is
a firefighter bar now.

113
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,141
Although we might want to make
some changes to the decor.

114
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:01,100
I'm thinking some old-timey
pressure gauges,

115
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:02,493
maybe an autographed photo

116
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:04,190
of Denis Leary
from "Rescue Me."

117
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,627
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?

118
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:07,759
Check it out.

00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:09,543

- Why are there firefighters
here?

133
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,145
Did one of them turn out
to be an arsonist

134
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:47,973
and burn down their own bar?
- Actually, yes.

135

But why did you call me?

136
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:50,758
There's nothing I can do

- Look, even if
I could save Shaw's,

139
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,197
I'm not sure I'd want to.

140
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,199
This place is a hovel.

141
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:59,724
The only wine they serve
is from the Delaware Water Gap.

142
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,203
It's called "Charbonnay."

143
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,162
- But this is our bar,
and it has been forever.

144
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,337
- Change is a good thing.

145
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,947
- Just yesterday,
you were ranting

146
00:05:05,991 --> 00:05:07,862
about the Philharmonic
adding a second piccolo.

147
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,168
- It's too many.
It'll muddle the sound.

148
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,256
- I'm sorry I brought it up.

149
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:12,214
- Look, we can find a new bar

150
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:13,651
that's not beneath us.

151
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:15,087
What about Bel Vino?

152
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,871
They've got a great selection
of Italian reds,

153
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:18,090
and your feet don't stick
to the floor

154
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:19,874
if you stand in one place
too long.

155
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,050
- Fine. If you're not gonna do
anything, then I will.

156
00:05:22,094 --> 00:05:23,835
Hank, you got to get rid
of these hose humpers.

157
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:24,879
It's them or us.
- Look, guys,

158
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:25,924
I don't want to take sides.

159
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,578
I just want to make money.

160
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,362
- Then keep it a cop bar.
We drink like crazy.

161
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:31,712
- Yeah, 'cause of all
the tragedy we experience

162
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:33,627
on a daily basis, son.

163
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:36,761
- Oh, yeah? We experience
plenty of tragedy too.

164
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,240
We lose a man a year
to the pole hole.

165
00:05:38,284 --> 00:05:39,938
- How about this?

166
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:42,897
If it's about money,
let's just have a drink-off.

167
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:45,160
Whoever racks up
the biggest tab by closing time

168
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:46,640
gets to keep Shaw's.

169
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:49,077
- Okay, defectives.

170
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:53,168
My guys can handle that.
- Oh, can they?

171
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:55,606
'Cause the Nine-Nine's
about to bring the real heat.

172
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:59,740
- Get ready for the back draft,
bitch.

173
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:01,307
- Jake, are you upset?
Where are you going?

174
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,787
Are you embarrassed
about your singing?

175
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,310
- Doug Judy.
- What?

176
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:08,053
- Hey, Jake.
Man, that song was moving AF.

177
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:09,794
We got to lay that down.

178
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,405
♪ Doug Judy,
he's smushing on the beach ♪

179
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:13,885
- Don't try and duet with me,
you bastard.

180
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:15,669
You tricked me.
Now give me a hug.

181
00:06:15,713 --> 00:06:16,888
I'm so happy you're alive.
I'll never forgive you.

182
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,716
You're my best friend.

183
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,021
Whoo, I just went through
a lot of emotions real fast,

184
00:06:20,065 --> 00:06:21,762
but I think I'm back
to normal now.

185
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,634
Should we get lunch?
- I would love a cheesesteak.

186
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,200
- I was thinking the exact same
thing, probably 'cause...

187
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:26,985
both: The coffin looks like
a hoagie roll.

188
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:28,769
- Judy, what the hell
is going on?

189
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:30,292
- Uh, who are you,
and where is Rosa?

190
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,251
- I'm his boss,
and I want answers.

191
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:33,687
- All right.
You know who Stefano Lucas is?

192
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:35,297
- The arms dealer?

193
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:37,299
- I got word he put a hit out
on me, so I had to disappear.

194
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:39,258
- Why does Stefano Lucas
want you dead?

195
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:40,738
- His favorite Ferrari
got stolen,

196
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:42,304
and for some reason
he thinks I did it.

197
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:43,784
- Probably because
someone's been jacking cars

198
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:45,220
all over Brooklyn
using your MO.

199
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:46,700
- Oh, my God.
Jake, are you saying

200
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:48,006
what I think you're saying?
- Yes.

201
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:50,182
You have a copycat.

202
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,923
I didn't think I'd accomplished
enough in my career for this.

203
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,315
- I know, it's big.

204
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,274
- It just feels so good
to be seen, you know?

205
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:57,276
- Wait. The only way
to catch a copycat

206
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,408
is to team up
with the original criminal.

207
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,323
- I'm back on the force!
Give me a gun.

208
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,804
- No! There is no copycat.
You did it.

209
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:05,719
- Not me.
I'm living that straight life.

210
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:07,939
- Terry refuses to believe it.
He thinks people can't change.

211
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:09,331
- Tell that to Bruce Banner's
pants and shirt.

212
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:10,768
- That's what I said.

213
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:12,030
- Doug Judy,
you're under arrest.

214
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:14,815
- What? Sarge?

215
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:17,078
You are really bringing down
the vibe at this funeral.

216
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,256
- What the hell is that?

217
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,867
- Jake got me this disguise

218
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,738
so some criminal doesn't see me
in here and tell Stefano.

219
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:26,784
- Okay, but why is Jake
also wearing them?

220
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:29,395
- Uh, because it looks
super cool, Sarge.

221
00:07:29,438 --> 00:07:31,440
We look like the hot twins
from "The Matrix."

222
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,792
- We are getting aggravated.

223
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:36,750
- You look like Milli Vanilli.
- Ooh! I call Vanilli.

224
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:38,578
- Ah, I want to be Nilli,
but you got it.

225
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:39,884
- He's the best one.
- You know it's true.

226
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,712
- So did you check out
Judy's alibi?

227
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:44,323
- Yes, and surprisingly,
it checks out.

228
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:46,455
Last Saturday night,
Doug was deejaying

229
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,979
Joshy Greenbaum's bar mitzvah.

230
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,632
- That was a wild party.

231
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:51,286
Auntie Karen is a freak.

232
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,766
- Judy, you deejay
bar mitzvahs?

233
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,594
- Best gig I ever had.
No one likes hip-hop more

234
00:07:54,637 --> 00:07:55,900
than a 13-year-old Jewish boy.

235
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,424
- Mm. So true.
- I'm not buying it.

236
00:07:58,467 --> 00:07:59,947
Probably stealing cash
off the gift table.

237
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,993
- Sarge, come on.
He has an alibi.

238
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:04,038
Let's just team up
and try and catch the copycat.

239
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,561
A thousand push-ups.

240
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:07,041
It's something Rosa and I
used to say.

241
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:08,913
It just means trust me.
If Judy's a criminal,

242
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,915
I'll do a thousand push-ups,
and since you're so confident,

243
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,655
if you're wrong,
you can do 'em.

244
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,440
- And a thousand push-ups?
That's a lot to you?

245
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:15,789
- You go to hell, Terry.

246
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,486
- Make it 100,000 push-ups,
and I'm in.

247
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,314
- Obviously I can't do
that much exercise,

248
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,403
but it doesn't matter, because
Doug Judy is telling the truth,

249
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:22,578
right, Judy?
- I got you, baby.

250
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:24,363
- So fine.
100,000 push-ups.

251
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:25,799
You happy, Sarge?

252
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:27,583
Great. Now, Doug...
- You never call me Doug.

253
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,020
- Yeah, well,
you called me Jake earlier.

254
00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:30,456
I thought we were switching
to first names.

255
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:31,674
- I was thinking
the same exact thing!

256
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:33,415
I was like,
"Why not call him Jake?"

257
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:34,634
- We're bonding, man.
- 'Cause he's so official.

258
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,594
- But it's chill now.

259
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:40,727
So, Doug...
- Yes, Jake?

260
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,034
- Now that we know the copycat
is using your playbook,

261
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:45,384
if you were still in the game—
which you're not,

262
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:47,821
we all agree—
what would your next move be?

263
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:49,736
- It's fight night at Barclays.

264
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,651
No sport attracts
more ultra-wealthy people

265
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:53,348
with super-nice cars
than boxing.

266
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:55,829
- Really? What about the sport
of hunting man?

267
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,657
- You got me.
- That's not a thing.

268
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,832
- Right. So should we just
start at Barclays then?

269
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:00,312
- Great.
But first, we got to make

270
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:02,009
a quick little pit stop
on the way.

271
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,315
- What? Where?

272
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:12,367
- Okay, here are the rules
to the contest.

273
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:13,847
If you order a drink,

274
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,849
it must be fully consumed
before you order another.

275
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:18,504
Each team's tab
will be tracked on that board.

276
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:20,723
We don't want anyone getting
alcohol poisoning,

277
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,377
so if you throw up,
you're disqualified.

278
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:23,683
- I never throw up.

279
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:24,902
I just tell my stomach
to deal with it.

280
00:09:24,945 --> 00:09:26,599
My body is terrified of me.

281
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:27,948
- Guys, there's no way
we can win.

282
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:29,820
There's nine of them
and six of us.

283
00:09:29,863 --> 00:09:31,865
- Five of you.
I'm going home.

284
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,736
Although perhaps I'll stop
at Bel Vino on the way,

285
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,868
have a glass of Sancerre.

286
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:36,609
Might even try
the quince paste

287
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:39,351
if I'm feeling... naughty.

288
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:40,874
- You're really gonna let
these firefighters

289
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:42,528
take Shaw's from us?

290
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,704
Think of all the celebrations
we've had here,

291
00:09:44,747 --> 00:09:46,880
all the times Terry has yelled
"Nine-Nine!"

292
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:47,925
- I hate it when he says that.

293
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:49,752
He should say, "Cheers

294
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:50,928
to the Ninety-Ninth Precinct!"

295
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:53,713
- We shouldn't be here.

296
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:55,149
- If you're worried
that someone will recognize me

297
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:56,803
and find out I'm still alive,
they won't.

298
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,544
There's not too many
hardened criminals

299
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:00,546
at Justin Friedman's
bar mitzvah.

300
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:03,679
Although there is a murderer
on the loose,

301
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,899
'cause Kevin Goldman is killing
those dance moves!

302
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:07,074
Get it, Kevin!

303
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:08,815
That's the floss.
He's flossing.

304
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,730
- It's just that we should be
at Barclays already.

305
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:11,949
The fights are starting soon.

306
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,951
- Rich guys never show up
on time.

307
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:16,127
Besides, I promised Justin
I'd be here.

308
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,476
What up, J-Smooth!

309
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,481
- Gone straight, my ass.
I got you, Doug Judy.

310
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:23,961
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

311
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:25,832
- Something felt wrong,
stopping for this bar mitzvah,

312
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,529
so I sent
some plainclothes officers

313
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:29,096
to watch the lots at Barclays.

314
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,098
They just caught the copycat.
- I don't understand.

315
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:32,883
If anything,
that proves Judy's innocent.

316
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,145
He's been standing here with us
the whole time.

317
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,887
- Which was his plan!
Establish an alibi,

318
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,671
so his partner can go off
stealing cars.

319
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:39,846
- I don't have a partner.

320
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,934
Whoever this is,
I promise you,

321
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:42,109
I do not know him.

322
00:10:42,153 --> 00:10:44,546
- Actually, Doug,
I think you do.

323
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,939
- Oh, my God.

324
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,462
all: Trudy Judy!

325
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,379
- You still want to pretend you
had nothing to do with this?

326
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:53,338
- I didn't,
and she didn't either.

327
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:54,382
Trudy Judy's not a car thief.

328
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:55,775
Trudy Judy's an angel.

329
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:57,255
She's putting herself through
nursing school.

330
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:58,778
And nurses are the best
of our society.

331
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,301
Name one bad nurse.

332
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:02,129
- Nurse Ratched.
Kathy Bates in "Misery."

333
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:03,609
Nurse Jackie
had a pill problem.

334
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:05,654
- Okay, damn, you got a lot
of real good examples

335
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,482
off the top of your head.
You believe me, right, Jake?

336
00:11:07,526 --> 00:11:09,136
- I mean, the fact pattern's
not great,

337
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,398
but Trudy did seem very nice
when I met her.

338
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,617
- You trying
to get your freak on

339
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,227
with my sister?
- What? No.

340
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,663
- I see you looking
at Trudy Judy's booty.

341
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,143
- I am not looking
at Trudy Judy's booty.

342
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,318
- Oh, you don't think
she's a cutie?

343
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:18,667
Don't be snooty.
- She's a beauty,

344
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,365
but I'm on duty.
- And you're married.

345
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:21,627
- Well, yeah,
but that doesn't rhyme.

346
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,628
- Sorry, I just get
so overprotective.

347
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:24,151
She's such a good kid.

348
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:26,023
I guarantee you,
she didn't steal those cars.

349
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,199
- We caught her sitting in a
Bentley with a power amplifier

350
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:30,505
and a homemade override
plugged into the CAN bus.

351
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,333
- Yeah, she guilty.

352
00:11:32,377 --> 00:11:34,466
- I can't believe you made us
think you were dead.

353
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:35,815
- I can't believe
you're out here stealing cars.

354
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,512
That's for lowlifes.
- You steal cars.

355
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,601
- And I'm a lowlife.
A gorgeous, charming,

356
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:40,733
super smart lowlife
beloved by all.

357
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:42,169
- I'm sorry, Dougie.

358
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:43,344
I was falling behind
on my student loans.

359
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:44,693
I had to do something.

360
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,347
- Guys, if you weren't
working together,

361
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:47,609
how did she know
all your signature moves?

362
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:49,046
- I found some of Doug's
old notebooks.

363
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:50,351
- Those are notes
for my memoir.

364
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:52,136
- Memoir?
Do you have title ideas yet?

365
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:55,313
- I was just gonna call it
"The Pontiac Bandit..."

366
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,142
- Oh, is that it?
- Yeah.

367
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,708
- Okay.
- I hated stealing cars.

368
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,580
I was gonna stop as soon
as nursing school was paid off,

369
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:03,495
I swear.
It was a mistake.

370
00:12:03,538 --> 00:12:05,236
- That's good enough for me.
Come on, Trudy, let's go home.

371
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,281
- That's not really
how arresting works.

372
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,543
She's going to jail.
- Wait, wait, wait.

373
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,110
What if we get you
a bigger fish?

374
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,807
What if we can get you Stefano?
- Who?

375
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:15,376
- That cherry red 1961 Ferrari
250GT California you took

376
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,291
belongs to a guy named
Stefano Lucas.

377
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:19,206
He thinks I did it,
and now he wants to kill me.

378
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,599
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

379
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,166
- It's all good.
You have the car,

380
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,124
so I call him,
tell him I'm not dead,

381
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,778
say I want to give him
his car back,

382
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:28,128
arrange a drop, and these guys
take him down or die trying.

383
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,608
- That is interesting.

384
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,392
Stefano almost never comes out
in public.

385
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:33,307
It would be a huge collar
for the Nine-Nine.

386
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,571
What do you say, Sarge?
100,000 push-ups?

387
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:39,270
- Fine. If you deliver Stefano,
I'll talk to the DA

388
00:12:39,313 --> 00:12:40,880
about a reduced sentence
for your sister.

389
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:43,578
- Thank you so much.
There's just one problem.

390
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:44,884
I don't have the car.

391
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,625
I already handed it off
to a fence.

392
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:49,106
- Oh, Judy, Judy,
you screwed me.

393
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:51,847
- Four hours left.
We're down $58.

394
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,762
Amy, where you at?
- Four drinks.

395
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,764
- What's four-drink Amy again?
- Why don't you come over here

396
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,158
and find out?
- Right, Horny Amy.

397
00:12:58,202 --> 00:12:59,855
It feels like you should retire
that one for the MeToo era.

398
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,119
- Why don't you come over here
and make me?

399
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:03,163
- All right, there's only
one thing left to do.

400
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:04,469
- Drink faster.

401
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:05,557
- Set a bunch of fires
throughout the city.

402
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,646
Mine's better.
- No!

403
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,387
We can do this.

404
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,084
Things seem bleak now,

405
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:13,826
but the night is always darkest
before the dawn.

406
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:16,437
This is Shaw's.

407
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:18,657
We've had weddings here,

408
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,267
and funerals.

409
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:23,227
Shaw's is part of our family,

410
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,881
because that is what we are.

411
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:27,405
A family.

412
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:29,885
And we're not just Amy and Rosa

413
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:31,452
and Hitchcock and—

414
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,115
- So the fence, Dallas,
he works in there.

415
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,508
- I don't like him.
My rule?

416
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,596
Never trust anyone
named after a city.

417
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,858
- What about Orlando Bloom?

418
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,468
- I never thought about him
being named

419
00:13:47,512 --> 00:13:49,557
after the city before,
and his last name is Bloom?

420
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,603
Wait a minute. Did we just
realize something crazy?

421
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:53,518
- No, everyone knows
it's a crazy name.

422
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:54,910
Now can we just focus
on the meet-up?

423
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:56,825
- Fine.
- All right, Dallas is creepy

424
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,393
and paranoid, and he really
freaked me out that last time.

425
00:13:59,437 --> 00:14:01,265
I don't want to go in alone.
- Don't worry, kid.

426
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,875
I'll be there
right next to you, as always.

427
00:14:02,918 --> 00:14:05,269
- Aw. Sarge, why don't you say
stuff like that to me?

428
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,359
- No, look, I do not trust
the Judys going anywhere alone.

429
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:10,143
Doug, you stay with Jake.
I'll go in with Trudy.

430
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:11,492
I just need a cover story.

431
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:12,667
- We could say
that you're my boyfriend.

432
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:14,147
- No. No, no, no,
I don't want

433
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,714
my little sister
fake-dating some pervert.

434
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:17,324
- What?
Why am I a pervert?

435
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:18,934
- Uh, have you ever met
a nice, normal guy

436
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:20,719
that wears suspenders
every day?

437
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:21,850
What kind of person
has to tie their pants down

438
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,504
to keep them from flying off?

439
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:24,723
- That's not what suspenders
are for, man.

440
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,507
- Guys, we don't have time

441
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:28,335
to figure out what suspenders
are for, all right?

442
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,207
Now, Trudy,
this is undercover work.

443
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,991
It can be very intense.
Are you sure you can handle it?

444
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:34,515
- I mean, I'll do my best.

445
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,691
- Who's this?
- This is Deion. He's my man.

446
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:39,520
Ask me another question,
you simple little barn animal.

447
00:14:39,564 --> 00:14:40,956
- Okay, so she can handle it.

448
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,523
- Why is your boyfriend here?

449
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,699
- Who said boyfriend?
Deion and I freak,

450
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:46,005
then he shuts
his pretty little mouth

451
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:47,746
and lets me handle my business.

452
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:48,964
- I don't like the direction
this is going.

453
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:50,705
- Easy.
She's just playing a part.

454
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,185
- Pretty big age difference
here.

455
00:14:52,229 --> 00:14:53,882
Where'd you guys meet?
- The club.

456
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,449
Deion was a bouncer,

457
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:58,322
and I told him I wanted him
to bounce on me.

458
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,671
- Oh, what is that?

459
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:00,976
Is she rubbing on his mic?

460
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,717
- The mic that was taped
to his chest?

461
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:04,197
- You should feel these.

462
00:15:04,241 --> 00:15:05,894
They're like
two baseball bases.

463
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,418
Make 'em pop, daddy.

464
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,854
- Daddy's not sure
this is the time.

465
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:10,377
- Do it, daddy!

466
00:15:10,421 --> 00:15:12,510
Ooh, ow!
Ooh, ow!

467
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:13,902
- Get your hands off her,
pervert!

468
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,687
- Judy! Judy!
I tried to stop him.

469
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,297
- That's my baby sister
you're caressing.

470
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:19,691
- What? How can I caress her
with my pecs?

471
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,301
- Look at those things.
They got thumbs.

472
00:15:21,345 --> 00:15:23,303
- Guys, guys, stop!
Where is Dallas?

473
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:24,652
- I think he got spooked
and ran away.

474
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:26,567
- Good job, Doug Judy.

475
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:28,743
You just cost your sister
a chance at a reduced sentence.

476
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:31,790
- Oh, no!
Why is my tone so playful?

477
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,574
Why is there a twinkle
in my eye?

478
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:39,928
Because I just found our
1961 Ferrari 250GT California.

479
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,365
- Oh, ho, ho!

480
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,454
Ladies and gents
and pervert Terry,

481
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:45,064
we are in business.

482
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,414
Sorry, Sarge, I got caught up
in the moment there.

483
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,286
- Guys, I threw up.

484
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:50,765
- Oh, man, it's over.

485
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,419
We need a miracle.
- I'm here.

486
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:53,855
- Captain Holt!
How are you here?

487
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:55,596
- You called me.
You didn't stop calling me.

488
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,685
- I didn't call you.
Look.

489
00:15:57,729 --> 00:15:59,513
- You left 17 voicemails.

490
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:00,775
Here's one.

491
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:02,777
- Holt!
You got to come save us.

492
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:04,605
We need a lie to get you here.

493
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:05,780
Charles, what should I say?

494
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,347
- That I got shot in the face.

495
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:08,957
Ooh, and tell him
to bring pizza.

496
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,611
- Whoo!
Crampon Holt!

497
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:11,830
We're losing.

498
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,919
Yeah!
- Why are you dancing?

499
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:15,747
- Oh, I was up
to nine-drink Amy,

500
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,575
who speaks French,

501
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,620
and then I hurl—

502
00:16:19,664 --> 00:16:21,753
I hurl—
hurled.

503
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:23,624
- What she's trying to say
is that she vomited,

504
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:25,452
and now she's back down
to three-drink Amy,

505
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:26,584
or Amy Dance Pants.

506
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:27,889
- You know it.

507
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,717
- My God.

508
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:31,719
Hitchcock, are you the only
person still making sense?

509
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:33,460
- Yeah. It's bad.

510
00:16:33,504 --> 00:16:35,941
- So are you gonna make us
give up, Clappin?

511
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:37,638
Or are you here to tell us
to stop?

512
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:39,292
- No, I'm here to help you win.

513
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:40,989
- What is happening?
Why is this?

514
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,774
- It's something you said
on one of your voicemails,

515
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:44,558
after you had sung
the entirety of a song

516
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:46,299
called "Shake Whatcha
Mama Gave Ya."

517
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:47,996
You thought you had hung up,
but you hadn't.

518
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,783
- Anyway, bye-bye.
What am I doing calling him?

519
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:54,438
He doesn't care about us
or what we want.

520
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,309
- When I heard that,
I was shaken to my core.

521
00:16:56,353 --> 00:16:58,006
I thought this bar
was beneath me,

522
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,661
but what was actually beneath
me was my own behavior.

523
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,663
I had turned my back on—
- Holt!

524
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:04,361
We do not have time for this.

525
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:05,840
Just drinky, drinky!

526
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:10,323
- Hank, bring me
a Charbonnay.

527
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,413
- All right, Stefano
should be here any minute.

528
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:14,893
- I just want to thank you guys
so much for helping me.

529
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,416
I don't deserve your kindness.

530
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,852
- Hey, don't be so hard
on yourself.

531
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:19,724
We all make bad decisions
when we're younger.

532
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,726
I was once in a flash mob.
- Ew.

533
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:23,031
- Something's off about this.

534
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,642
I don't like leaving Judy
out there alone.

535
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:25,904
- Relax, we have a tracker
on the car,

536
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:27,514
a tracker on Doug Judy,

537
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:29,647
and ESU has the entire area
surrounded.

538
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,518
It's gonna be fine.
- We got movement.

539
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,520
- Okay, everyone,
to your positions.

540
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:34,782
On my signal.

541
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:37,437
Hold. Hold.

542
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:39,134
Hold.

543
00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:40,832
Sorry, I started holding
too soon.

544
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,877
Let's start over.
Hold.

545
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,575
Hold.

546
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,098
And...

547
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:49,884
Everyone, stop holding!
Go, go, go, go!

548
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:54,454
- Where is he?
Where is he?

549
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:56,021
- Got him.
They got Stefano.

550
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:58,153
- No, not Stefano.
The Pontiac Bandit.

551
00:17:58,197 --> 00:17:59,981
Where is—
- Doug Judy here.

552
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:01,331
Y'all see that car blow up?

553
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:02,680
- Yeah, we did.
Why did you do that?

554
00:18:02,723 --> 00:18:04,203
- You think I did that?

555
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:05,987
Doug Judy does not work
with fire.

556
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,641
- Yeah, he's like the Hound
from "Game of Thrones."

557
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,556
- I am like the Hound.
And you're my Arya.

558
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,210
- Right?
- Guys!

559
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:13,691
If Doug Judy didn't blow up
the car, who did?

560
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,564
all: Trudy Judy.

561
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,528
- Damn, sir, you took
that Charbonnay to the house.

562
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,356
How you feeling?
- Let me take stock.

563
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,183
My equilibrium is askew,

564
00:18:28,227 --> 00:18:30,360
my vision is partially
impaired,

565
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:32,187
and I'm clearly slurring
my words.

566
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:34,276
To put a fine point on it,
your boy is turnt.

567
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,409
- Well, well, well,
there's only a minute left,

568
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:38,368
and you are six bucks down.

569
00:18:38,411 --> 00:18:39,630
I don't think you guys
are gonna make it.

570
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:41,458
- Hank, another Charb.

571
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:43,373
- This one's hot.
It was sitting on the radiator.

572
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:50,641
- He's never gonna make it.
- Yes, he will.

573
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:53,513
Just don't breathe.
Let the liquid into your lungs.

574
00:18:55,515 --> 00:18:59,693
- Five, four, three, two...

575
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:01,216
Closing time!
Cops win!

576
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,615
- All right, fine,
the bar is yours.

577
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:12,053
But we're keeping this!

578
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:13,446
Come on.

579
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,492
- Before we all go home
and pass out,

580
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,451
I want to say how sorry I am
that I deserted you earlier.

581
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:21,498
I want you to know that I care
about you all so very much,

582
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,803
each and every one of you.

583
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:25,371
Boyle, Santiago, Diaz,
Hitchcock...

584
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:30,376
- All right, I have officers
looking for her.

585
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,160
She was on foot.
She couldn't have gone far.

586
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,293
- This is her.

587
00:19:34,336 --> 00:19:36,469
Where are you, Trudy?
- In the wind, Dougie.

588
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:38,428
- Okay, that's a cool thing to
say, but what are you doing?

589
00:19:38,471 --> 00:19:39,646
They were gonna reduce
your charges.

590
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,343
- Reduced charges
are still charges,

591
00:19:41,387 --> 00:19:42,736
and I can't go to prison.

592
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,783
There are no dudes there,
and I need to smush!

593
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:47,437
- Trudy!
- Oh, grow up, Doug.

594
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,439
I'm an adult woman
who's horny all the time.

595
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,702
- What is going on?
- Oh, are you judging me, ho?

596
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:53,268
- Trudy, running from the cops
is a felony.

597
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:54,400
That means no more
nursing school.

598
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,619
- Good. It sucked.

599
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,837
I only went to, like,
one class.

600
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,448
- What?
- It was boring as hell.

601
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,406
So then I started running
Internet scams.

602
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,668
Then there was identity theft.

603
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:03,365
I was Queen Latifah for a bit.

604
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,280
Then Lil' Kim.
That was less believable.

605
00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:07,848
But then I found
your old notebooks.

606
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:10,416
How come you never told me
how much fun car thieving is?

607
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,852
- Because I didn't want you
to fall in love with it.

608
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:13,463
- Wait, I'm confused.

609
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:15,160
When did you put the bomb
in the Ferrari?

610
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:16,683
- I didn't do it.
Dallas did.

611
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:18,685
And Dallas isn't some criminal
I'm afraid of.

612
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:20,644
He's my employee.
Say what's up, Dallas.

613
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,863
- Wassup?
- Named after a city.

614
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,474
- The hard part was
trying to figure out

615
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:25,910
how to tell him my plan,
so then I came up

616
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:27,433
with that whole
boyfriend thing,

617
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,174
because I needed a distraction.

618
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:30,915
I knew you'd rush in,
all weird and old-fashioned,

619
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,482
try to protect my honor.

620
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,658
- How can I caress her
with my pecs?

621
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,486
- Look at those things.
They got thumbs.

622
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:38,139
- I don't need you
to protect me, Doug.

623
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:39,358
- You're my baby sister.

624
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:40,620
I got to look out for you.

625
00:20:40,664 --> 00:20:42,927
- That's so sweet,
and also dumb.

626
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,711
I'll see you at Christmas,
sucker!

627
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,539
I love you, big bro.

628
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,758
- Trudy!

629
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:50,369
Man, I am gutted.
This is awful.

630
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:52,284
Is this how you feel every time
I trick you?

631
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:53,328
- Pretty much.
Yeah, it always hurts.

632
00:20:53,372 --> 00:20:54,721
- Wow, I'm sorry, man.

633
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:56,244
It must be really hard
to hang out with me.

634
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,245
- Well, it's a tough
relationship,

635
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,682
but it's exciting.

636
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,379
- Hey, Doug, I'm sorry
for not trusting you.

637
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:01,685
Turns out you had nothing to do
with this.

638
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:04,688
- Oh, so you admit
people can change.

639
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:07,429
- Yes. Bruce Banner's pants
and shirt were correct.

640
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:08,909
- You know what this means,
right?

641
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:10,650
- 6,203.

642
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:12,826
6,204.

643
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,654
I am so glad I lost this bet.

644
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:16,526
I never find time
for things I enjoy.

645
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:17,527
- This is so unsatisfying.

646
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:18,832
You're not even sweating.

647
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:20,442
- It's too easy.
Get on my back, Jake.

648
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:21,879
- No, I'm not—
- Get on my back, Jake!

649
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:23,445
- Coming, strong man!

650
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:25,447
- Fremulon.

651
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:26,710
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
