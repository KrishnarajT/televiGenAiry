1
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:09,163
- Confucius, Buddha, Jesus—

2
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:10,947
they all brought
light to darkness.

3
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:13,950
But none of them had one
million subscribers, so...

4
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:15,300
They... can...

5
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:16,431
suck it!

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,607
- Your videos changed my life!

7
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,609
Changed my life!

8
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,612
- You are my qu-qu-queen!

9
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:28,661
- No, Italian girl.

10
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:32,273
We are changing the world,
for we are the G-Hive.

11
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:36,451
And today we are celebrating
our 1 millionth subscriber.

12
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,627
Over 1 million people
are living their lives

13
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,194
according to
the Gina-mandments.

14
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:41,500
They're like
the Ten Commandments,

15
00:00:41,543 --> 00:00:43,241
only there's more
and they're better.

16
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:45,286
I would now like to express
my gratitude

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,767
the best way I know how—
through song.

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,943
♪ Gratitude

19
00:00:49,986 --> 00:00:51,858
Grati-tat-tat-tat
tatitude!

20
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,773
Grati-tat-tat-tat-tatitude!

21
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:54,774
Gratitude.

22
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:17,231
- Guys? Guess who I just
got off the phone with.

23
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,450
- My cousin Pam.

24
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:20,278
- What? No.
Why would you think that?

25
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:21,583
- You always seemed kind of
jealous of my relationship

26
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:23,019
with him, so I thought maybe

27
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:24,369
you called him up to
settle your differences.

28
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:25,674
- I'm definitely
not jealous of Pam.

29
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:26,893
He owns a bird shop.
I barely remember him.

30
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:28,460
- You remember
the bird shop.

31
00:01:28,503 --> 00:01:29,809
- It wasn't Pam.
No, I was actually talking to

32
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:32,246
none other than Gina Linetti.
- Really?

33
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,856
No one's heard
from her in months.

34
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,597
- Well, she just invited us
to go check out her new place.

35
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,338
- I'm surprised you're
so excited to see her.

36
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:38,644
I mean, she's been blowing
you off ever since she left.

37
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:40,515
- What? In what way?
- She bailed

38
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,690
on your birthday drinks.
- It wasn't that fun.

39
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,475
- She was a no-show

40
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:44,519
at your Secret Santa party!
- Christmas is overrated.

41
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,868
- She hasn't called you

42
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:47,261
in months!
- I'm not that interesting.

43
00:01:47,305 --> 00:01:48,480
Look,
what is going on with you?

44
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:50,046
Are you hangry?
- No. I just ate

45
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,048
six hardboiled eggs.
- Well, maybe you should've

46
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:53,746
made it a cool "doz."
Look, I know Gina

47
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,443
hasn't been around very much,
but we're gonna spend time

48
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:57,663
with her today, and it's gonna
be just like old times.

49
00:01:57,706 --> 00:01:59,055
- Gina's gonna be
a few minutes.

50
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,666
Her photo shoot
is running over.

51
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,320
- Yes, Moses!
Lookin' good!

52
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:03,712
Now work those
Commandments!

53
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:07,238
- See, Sarge?
Just like old times.

54
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,458
- Ah, Boyle, there you are.
I have a question for you.

55
00:02:10,502 --> 00:02:11,981
- Daddy, wait up!

56
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:13,853
- Oh, your non-adult is
at our place of work.

57
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:15,376
- Nikolaj had
a half-day at school

58
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,638
for Mariano Rivera's
birthday.

59
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:17,813
I'm watching him
on my lunch break.

60
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,032
Nikolaj, say "hi"
to Captain Holt.

61
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:20,860
- Hi, Captain Holt!
How's Mr. Kevin?

62
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:22,688
- Stressed.
His annual budget review

63
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:24,646
is today, and a recent change
in federal policy

64
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,388
means his grant situation
is... tenuous.

65
00:02:27,432 --> 00:02:28,998
At best.
- Okay.

66
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,000
- Hey Nikolaj, Daddy
and Captain Holt need to talk.

67
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:32,785
Why don't you go
do some drawing?

68
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:35,091
Oh, he loves doing art.
He made a portrait

69
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,790
of our dog Biscuit that had
all of his surgical scars.

70
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,922
- Yes.
Children are wonders.

71
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:42,925
I'm conducting a statistical
analysis to get a more nuanced

72
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,319
understanding of which areas
in our jurisdiction

73
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,408
need greater
police presence with a hope

74
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:49,758
of developing a formula that—

75
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,586
What on Walden Pond is this?

76
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,066
- Nikolaj,
no, that's important!

77
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,546
I'm so sorry, sir.
I don't spank him,

78
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:57,766
but I will reprimand
him in my own way.

79
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,420
Niko.
I love you.

80
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:01,596
- I'm so sorry, Daddy!
- No, no, no.

81
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,902
He didn't ruin it,
he solved it.

82
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:05,600
The absolute value of psi.

83
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,603
Nikolaj cracked the equation.
Boyle...

84
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,780
your boy is a genius!

85
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,435
- Jacob!
Terrencio!

86
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,394
Give Moses a hug!

87
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:18,439
Uhh!
It's so good to see you!

88
00:03:18,483 --> 00:03:20,876
Ugh, that shoot took forever.

89
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,443
Did Janelle offer you a snack?

90
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:23,836
- She did. I had linguini.

91
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,577
So what's been
going on with you?

92
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,100
- Well, that's actually
why I called.

93
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:28,884
It's not a big deal at all,

94
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,364
but someone's
threatening to murder me.

95
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:31,800
- What?
- Damn, Gina!

96
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,106
- I mean, I'm not worried
about it in the slightest.

97
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:34,629
Anyone who has
an online presence

98
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,022
gets meaningless threats.

99
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,154
It actually is a sign
that I made it.

100
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:39,852
- Congrats?
- Thanks, thank you.

101
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:42,507
The only thing is, I have
my first speaking engagement

102
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,770
tomorrow and the organizer
says he's going to cancel it

103
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:47,773
unless I have police
protection, so...

104
00:03:47,816 --> 00:03:49,688
would you guys come tomorrow
and police protect me?

105
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,081
- Yes, of course, yes.
- Oh, thanks so much.

106
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,868
This is my agent.
I'm so sorry.

107
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:57,826
Duncan, this better
be good news.

108
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,742
- Oh, it is—your video's
huge, from Spokane to Spain,

109
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:03,615
you're global, Gines!
Now, let's. Talk. Strategy.

110
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:05,530
- This is gonna take a while.

111
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,401
Do you guys want to get drinks
at Shaw's later and catch up?

112
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:09,142
- Oh, yeah.
That sounds really fun.

113
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,883
- Great.
I'll see you then!

114
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:12,798
- Okay.
- So, Duncs,

115
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,843
I have an idea
for a second book.

116
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,455
It's a memoir,
and it's made of memes.

117
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:19,587
So, it's called a meme-oir.

118
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,808
- Whoa, Rosa!
What happened?

119
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,636
- I touched poison oak.
The doctor says I have to keep

120
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,812
my hands bandaged for a week
so I don't scratch them.

121
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,640
- How did it happen?
- I was on a nature hike

122
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:29,858
and I went off-trail
to pick a pretty little flower.

123
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,512
- Awwww.

124
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:32,774
- Shut up.
Now scram.

125
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,428
I have a case
report to type up.

126
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:36,169
- Uh, there's no way
you're using a keyboard

127
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:38,693
with your hands like that.
Oh, I could help you!

128
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,175
Not to brag, but at typing
camp, everyone called me

129
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:43,829
"The Finger Queen."

130
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:45,091
Oh, my God, that
sounds really dirty.

131
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:46,701
I swear that's not
what it meant.

132
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,224
- Yeah, it was typing camp.
Nobody thinks that.

133
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,878
Anyway,
I don't need your help.

134
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:50,966
- You're really gonna try
to make it through

135
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,185
an entire day on your own?

136
00:04:52,228 --> 00:04:53,795
Well, well, well.

137
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,884
Rosa Diaz is finally
gonna learn the lesson

138
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,452
that no matter how strong
she is on her own,

139
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,194
true strength comes from
accepting help from others.

140
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:02,761
- That's not what's happening.

141
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,633
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

142
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:06,765
That's how normal people
take their coats off.

143
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,114
- I'm fine.

144
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:09,768
- I can see that.
- This is going well.

145
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:10,812
- Clearly.

146
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,562
- Why are you sliding into
my side of the booth?

147
00:05:21,606 --> 00:05:23,564
- Because that side
is the solo side.

148
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,087
You always put the person
you want to catch up with

149
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:26,915
on the solo side, otherwise
one of us will spend

150
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,569
the whole night straining
our necks looking sideways.

151
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:30,484
- I'm straining my neck
talking to you right now.

152
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:31,920
- Okay, so don't
look at me, Terry.

153
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,052
Just face forward.
You see me every day.

154
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:34,183
- Fine.
- Fine.

155
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:35,968
- I gotta say,
I'm surprised Gina

156
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,926
invited us to drinks tonight.
She obviously only invited us

157
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,928
over to her place
because she needed a favor.

158
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,539
- Why are you still
so down on her?

159
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:43,105
- I've been through
this before.

160
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,586
In college, I had a football
buddy, Bryant Ungerbert—

161
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,283
- Oh, lemme guess.
You guys were best friends,

162
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:48,937
then he got drafted
into the NFL,

163
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,591
and now you never talk.
- No, he got drafted into

164
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:51,940
the Canadian football league,

165
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,594
became a long snapper
for Ottawa,

166
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:55,944
and even that level of
success ruined our friendship.

167
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,642
- He's still playing?
How is that possible?

168
00:05:57,685 --> 00:05:59,774
You're 35 to 60 years old.

169
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,602
- It's Canada.
They don't tackle as hard.

170
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:04,518
Anyway, his career became
the only thing that mattered.

171
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,215
He was off doing
photo shoots, commercials,

172
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,956
speaking at long
snapping conventions—

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,262
- Is that a thing?
- In Canada,

174
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,220
it's like the Oscars.
Look, the point is

175
00:06:11,264 --> 00:06:13,092
he stopped making time
for his friends.

176
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,746
- Fine, but that's not
what's happening here.

177
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:16,225
Nothing has changed
with Gina.

178
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,966
She's not an Ungerbert.
- Hi.

179
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,969
So, Gina won't be able
to make it tonight.

180
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,189
She doesn't have time.
But here are your credentials

181
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,800
for tomorrow's event.
Have a great night.

182
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,585
- Oh, no.

183
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,674
She isan Ungerbert.

184
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,984
- Hey, Gina's prepping inside.
You get some rest last night?

185
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,595
- Yeah,
because I got home

186
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:39,335
from our 9:30 drinks at 9:41.
I was in bed by 10:00.

187
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,554
Then I looked at my phone
for another two hours,

188
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:41,642
so actually I didn't
sleep very well.

189
00:06:41,686 --> 00:06:43,296
But I did realize something.

190
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,167
The only thing that
matters to Gina is work.

191
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:47,474
- You don't say?
Where have I heard that before?

192
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:49,128
- I don't know, Terry.
I don't have time for your

193
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:50,695
weird memory lapse.
- I said it last night.

194
00:06:50,738 --> 00:06:52,566
- Well, I wish you
would've said it to me.

195
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,002
Anyway, I decided I'm not
gonna let it go this time.

196
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,787
After we update
her on the case,

197
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,310
I'm gonna say something to her.
- Good. I wish

198
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:58,616
I'd have
said something to Ungerbert.

199
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,356
Long snapper used to be
my favorite position.

200
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,401
- Really?
- Yeah.

201
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:03,011
- Hmm.
Well...

202
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,578
you a weirdo.

203
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:07,581
- Timothée Chalamet,
shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.

204
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,541
Timothée Chalamet,
shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.

205
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:11,803
- Gina.
- Oh, sorry.

206
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:13,282
I'm doing my vocal warm-up.
- Great.

207
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:15,023
Well, cyber looked into
the threats,

208
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,547
and they traced
a number of negative comments

209
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,375
back to another internet
celebrity, Marvin Lennox.

210
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,334
- Marvin Lennox. Yeah,
I'm not worried about him.

211
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:24,337
He's an inspirational baker.
- Inspirational baker?

212
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,339
What the hell is that?

213
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,733
- A man is like a quiche,
and a quiche is only

214
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:31,605
as strong as its crust.
What's your crust?

215
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:33,564
- Oh, that's exactly
what it sounds like.

216
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,827
- Yeah, he's not a threat.
He lives in Utah, and again,

217
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,611
just to remind you—
inspirational baker.

218
00:07:37,655 --> 00:07:39,613
- Right. Well, even so,
we have metal detectors

219
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:41,572
at all of the entrances,
and we'll keep our eyes peeled

220
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:44,575
for anything suspicious.
Also, before we head in there,

221
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:46,185
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

222
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:48,100
- What's up?
- Well, it just kind of

223
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:50,276
bummed me out that last night
you blew us off.

224
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,104
For work. Again.

225
00:07:52,147 --> 00:07:54,367
- What? Uh, no.
I did not miss drinks for work.

226
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,543
I had food poisoning.
Did Janelle not tell you?

227
00:07:56,587 --> 00:07:58,371
- No.
- Wow, that's crazy.

228
00:07:58,414 --> 00:08:00,416
'Cause I specifically told her
to tell you—you know what?

229
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,375
I'm gonna fire her.
- You don't have to do that.

230
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:04,203
- Janelle.
- Oh, God, doing it now?

231
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:05,639
- Hi, Gina.
- Okay.

232
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:07,206
Well, Sarge and I
should probably hit it,

233
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:08,599
get back in there,
survey some people.

234
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:10,426
But have a great show.

235
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,167
Janelle, just remember
you're gonna have a lot of jobs

236
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:13,429
in your life—this is but
a blip on your résumé.

237
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:14,561
Okay Sarge, let's go.

238
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,215
- Wanted to see me, sir?

239
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:17,651
- Yes, I wanted to talk
to you about Nikolaj.

240
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:20,088
How long have you known
he was a genius?

241
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,568
- I mean, I always
knew he was bright.

242
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:23,396
I just never realized
he was that smart.

243
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,267
- Well, there's
no sugarcoating it.

244
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,878
You're a terrible father.
- What?

245
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:28,575
- You've been asleep
at the wheel, man!

246
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:31,099
What have you done to cultivate
his incredible mind?

247
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:33,754
- I read to him every night.
- Shakespeare? Tolstoy?

248
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:35,626
- No, nothing that advanced.
- Egads, are you reading him

249
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,757
Dickens?

250
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,411
- Yes?
- Boyle!

251
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:40,587
My father
never saw my potential.

252
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:42,763
In grade school, I wanted
to spend all my free time

253
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:46,593
drawing graphs and charts, but
he insisted I play basketball.

254
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,248
As if I care about
slam dunking a three-pointer.

255
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,771
Don't be my father, Boyle!

256
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:53,600
- I wouldn't dare!
What do you think I should do?

257
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:56,690
- Let me tutor Nikolaj.
Nothing too strenuous.

258
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,214
Maybe some geometry,
statistical mechanics,

259
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:02,348
perhaps some Latin lyric
poetry thrown in for fun.

260
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:03,784
- Oh, I don't know.
He's really booked.

261
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,699
I guess I could cancel
his cartooning class,

262
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:07,701
but he really loves it.
- Don't do that.

263
00:09:07,745 --> 00:09:09,616
I hate to think of
all the great cartoons

264
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,879
humanity missed out on
because Einstein

265
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:14,490
was just too busy
reinventing physics.

266
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:15,709
- Okay, I'll cancel the class.

267
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:17,624
- I mean, who needs
relativity when we

268
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:20,540
could've had Einstein's take
on lasagna-eating cats.

269
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,455
- I said I'd cancel.
- Did he hate Mondays?

270
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:24,283
We'll never know.

271
00:09:24,326 --> 00:09:25,632
- Okay, I'm going, I'm going!

272
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,725
- Ugh, why won't this
dumb monitor turn on?

273
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,553
- Because you can't work
without your hands.

274
00:09:33,596 --> 00:09:35,598
- Trust us.
If you could do this job

275
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,644
without lifting a finger,
we would've already cracked it.

276
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:39,298
- Because we're lazy boys.

277
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:40,647
- I'm just not doing it
hard enough.

278
00:09:40,691 --> 00:09:42,388
Mmm!
- Ooh!

279
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:43,737
That's a double-sponger.

280
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,391
- All right.

281
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,872
I am cleaning this up,
and no one is helping me.

282
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:49,177
- Not a problem.

283
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,788
- Because we're lazy boys.

284
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,796
- You gotta be kidding me!

285
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:04,236
- In the beginning,
there was nothing.

286
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,718
And then God,
a woman, said,

287
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,589
"Let there be Gina!"

288
00:10:14,507 --> 00:10:16,509
- Gina!
Please look at me!

289
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:19,773
- You're welcome.

290
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:21,601
- Aaaaah!

291
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:23,777
- It's gonna be hard to spot
a crazy person in here.

292
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,692
They're all crazy.
- Tell me about it.

293
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:27,346
This is more insane
than the crowd

294
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:28,956
at the Carly Rae Jepson
I mean Slayer concert.

295
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,523
- G-Hive!

296
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,395
Are you ready for
three new Gina-mandments?

297
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:35,484
Number one.

298
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:38,357
You can be anything
you set your mind to...

299
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,360
as long as you're
already great at it!

300
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:42,709
Number two.

301
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:45,320
No one knows you
can't take it with you!

302
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:47,932
Be buried with your money.

303
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,716
Cha-ching!

304
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,849
Number three.

305
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,852
If you fall down nine times...

306
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,462
you gotta reassess
your walking,

307
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,812
'cause something's wrong.

308
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:02,337
And now, I wanna hear
from you, my baby G-Hive!

309
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:04,383
Yes, girl
in the mustard sweater.

310
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:06,298
- Hi, Gina.
I just quit my job

311
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,561
and left my husband who loves
parkour more than he loves me.

312
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:10,563
And it's all because
of your Gina-mendment:

313
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:13,653
"If the light in your house
is dim, change the bulb."

314
00:11:13,696 --> 00:11:15,350
- Yes!

315
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:17,962
I have time for
15 more compliments.

316
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,485
- Hey, Jake.
I think Lennox is here.

317
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,573
- I see him.
You get him.

318
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:22,357
I'll stick with Gina.

319
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:23,576
- Uh-oh.
He's moving.

320
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:26,448
Coming through.

321
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:28,581
There's too many hoodies.
I lost him.

322
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:30,539
Get Gina out of here, now!
- And now the time has come

323
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,454
for ya'll to meditate.

324
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,892
Close your eyes
while I sing to you.

325
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:37,851
♪ Breathe in, breathe out

326
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:40,027
♪ I invented meditation

327
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:41,681
R—
- Gina, we gotta go.

328
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:43,422
Lennox is here.
- Told you I'm not

329
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:44,902
worried about Lennox.
- Well, it's not your call.

330
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:47,078
We're leaving.
- Jake, you're overreacting.

331
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:52,823
On second thought, maybe we
should get out of here.

332
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,915
- Okay. Kitchen's all clear.
- Bedroom's clear.

333
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,003
- Can't believe
I just escaped death!

334
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,178
I haven't felt
this alive since

335
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,875
I almost got killed by
that bus.

336
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,485
- I know, right?
What a rush.

337
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,400
Feel just like Kevin Costner
in "The Bodyguard"!

338
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:07,402
- What? If anyone's
like Kevin Costner it's me.

339
00:12:07,446 --> 00:12:09,187
I'm the one carrying Gina!

340
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,103
- Well, I think we can agree
we were both Kevin Costner.

341
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:13,539
- No!
- Jake, that was so dope

342
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:15,236
when you were like,
"Clear a path!"

343
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,021
- Guys, uniformed officers

344
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:19,197
found Marvin hiding in
a bathroom at the event space.

345
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,851
He's in custody.
We got him!

346
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:22,548
- That's great!
I hope they give him the chair.

347
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:25,768
Ooh, we should celebrate.
Champagne's in the fridge.

348
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:26,769
- On it.

349
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,513
- Duncan, I almost died.
It was amazing.

350
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:34,038
- I heard all about it, Gines.
Look, you're trending!

351
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:35,996
- And from my pain
comes triumph!

352
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,998
- Love that.
And we can use this publicity

353
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,174
to get more money out of
those bottled water guys.

354
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,915
You really impressed them
at drinks last night!

355
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,222
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah—we
should talk about this later.

356
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,485
- Sorry, you're breaking up.
Look, I said they loved you

357
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:48,400
at the drinks last night—
the drinks last night

358
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:50,184
that you had with
the water people?

359
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,273
Crap, I just hit
the Holland Tunnel, but again,

360
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,319
great job
with the drinks last night!

361
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:56,799
Bye.

362
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,192
- Jake, did you hear that?

363
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,281
- I did, and there's
been a change of plans.

364
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,544
I'm gonna take a rain
check on the champagne,

365
00:13:02,588 --> 00:13:04,459
but it was wonderful
seeing you.

366
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:06,200
- Why are you talking
like a flight attendant?

367
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,376
- This is how I always talk
when everything is okay.

368
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,074
Which it is right now.

369
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,946
Please enjoy
the rest of your day.

370
00:13:13,904 --> 00:13:15,906
- How did Nikolaj do?
Were you able to overcome

371
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,429
my horrible parenting?
- No, it's far worse

372
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:19,126
than I could've ever imagined.

373
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,867
I showed him a periodic
table, and he thought

374
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,347
it was a coloring book
illustration.

375
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,088
- I blame myself.

376
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,568
It's such a classic Boyle trait
not to recognize talent.

377
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:29,528
My cousin Susan didn't know she
could sing until her late 40s.

378
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,922
- Honestly, given the hole
that you've put him in,

379
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,098
he needs more expert
help than I can provide.

380
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,838
But, there is...

381
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,971
a boarding school
in Switzerland that would be

382
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:40,234
a perfect fit for him.
He can enroll immediately.

383
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,975
- In Switzerland?
I'd never see him.

384
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,890
- Then uproot your life
and move there with him.

385
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,065
No one here would miss you.

386
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:46,414
- Hmm.
We could live in Gruyere,

387
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,981
the fondue capital
of the world.

388
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:49,635
Oh, I don't know.
It's such a big change.

389
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:51,071
- Well, he's the genius.

390
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:52,464
Why don't we ask him
what he wants to do?

391
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:53,987
- Good point.

392
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:55,858
Niko?
We need to talk.

393
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,860
- Wait.
Why is he writing the solution

394
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,471
to my formula for no reason?

395
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:02,213
And why is he drawing
colorful underpants beneath it?

396
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:05,346
- Oh, I see what's happening.
He's drawing Boy Riga,

397
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,001
loyal sidekick to his favorite
superhero, Captain Latvia.

398
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:10,438
- That's his symbol.
He distributes grain evenly

399
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,657
among the working class.

400
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,312
- Uh-huh. I see.

401
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:17,010
So this was all just
some coincidence.

402
00:14:17,054 --> 00:14:19,230
He wasn't writing
the absolute value of psi.

403
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:21,014
He was just...

404
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:23,103
doodling.

405
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:28,369
Aaaah!

406
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:32,243
Raaah! Uhhh! Ahhh!

407
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:36,247
- Rosa?
Are you stuck in there?

408
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,900
- No, I'm in here by choice.

409
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:40,425
- Oh, 'cause I hear
some banging noises

410
00:14:40,468 --> 00:14:43,341
as if someone was struggling
to open the door.

411
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:44,559
- No.
That was the pipes.

412
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:46,518
- Or, is it the sound of you

413
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:48,172
learning how to ask for help?

414
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:49,477
You know, you can't spell

415
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,045
"independent"
without "dependant."

416
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,438
And you can't spell
"Go yourself"

417
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:54,656
without " you."

418
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,051
- Jake, I had a work thing.

419
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:59,531
I can't believe you're being
such a baby about this.

420
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:01,185
- I'm not being a baby.

421
00:15:01,228 --> 00:15:02,664
- Look, I'm sorry I lied, okay?

422
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,188
It was a big
opportunity for me.

423
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,059
I was having drinks with
the brand director of

424
00:15:06,103 --> 00:15:07,582
a bottled water company.

425
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:11,282
I can't say which one, but it
rhymes with, "fart water."

426
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,197
- Perhaps one day
I will laugh at that.

427
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,721
In the meantime, I'm happy
for all your success.

428
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,724
I hope your partnership with
"fart water" is very fruitful.

429
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,334
Good day.
- Come on, dude.

430
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,683
Just talk to me.
- I would if we were friends,

431
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,163
but you're making it
it very clear

432
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:24,643
that we are not,
so I shan't.

433
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:26,558
- Oh, you're shanting me?
- Yeah, that's right.

434
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,950
- Jake!
- Can't hear you.

435
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,343
You're shanted!
- Jake!

436
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,084
- I told you I only
talk to my friends.

437
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,390
- No, Jake.

438
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,566
I think I just got stabbed
by that guy.

439
00:15:34,609 --> 00:15:36,742
- Oh, yeah, ya did.

440
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,265
Ya definitely did.

441
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,053
- The ambulance is on its way.
They said not to

442
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,141
remove the knife.
- Great.

443
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:45,664
- What's up?
I got your text—

444
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:47,187
Oh, my God, Gina,
there's a knife in you!

445
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:48,971
Jake, did you stab Gina?

446
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,626
- I didn't stab Gina, okay?
Lennox wasn't our guy.

447
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,845
The real perp did it.
He's in a black hoodie

448
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:54,194
and jeans.
He ran that way.

449
00:15:54,238 --> 00:15:55,935
- I'm on it.
- I want you to stay calm

450
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:57,545
and just try to keep
all of your blood

451
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,199
inside your body.
- Bitch, what do you think

452
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:01,201
I'm doing?
- Yeah, I don't know

453
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:03,160
why I said that.
- Bring your ass down here so

454
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:05,205
we can finish our conversation.
- We can do that later, Gina.

455
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:07,860
- First of all, I have
so much adrenaline pumping

456
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:09,775
through my body right now
I can feel almost nothing.

457
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,472
Secondly,
you can't say no to me.

458
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:12,952
I have a knife in my back.
- Yeah, that tracks.

459
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:14,910
Okay, fine.
So I was saying that

460
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,826
ever since you left you've
been kind of a crappy friend.

461
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,133
- Brrrrrawwwwwwoo.

462
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,092
- We're definitely not having
this conversation right now.

463
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:24,094
- No, it's okay.
It just hurt for a sec.

464
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:26,183
Come on, let's do it.
Ugh.

465
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:27,967
- All right, fine,
what was I saying?

466
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,144
- You were saying that I'm a—
Ahh, bad friend.

467
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:34,104
- Right.
You're a bad friend.

468
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:35,583
That's what
I was saying to you.

469
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,933
- Yeah.
- And just that, you know,

470
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:39,761
you've been really blowing me
off for the last few months,

471
00:16:39,805 --> 00:16:41,937
and last night you
lied to me about being sick.

472
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:43,765
That really sucked.
- All right, well, listen.

473
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,550
I'm sorry I lied, Jake.

474
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:48,161
I saw you were getting upset
and I didn't want to hurt you.

475
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:50,511
But I don't know what to say
about the other stuff because

476
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:53,775
this is my life and I don't
want to apologize for that.

477
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,603
- No, and Gina,
you shouldn't have to.

478
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,953
Look, I'm really proud of you.
You're totally killing it.

479
00:16:57,997 --> 00:16:59,477
- Yeah,
people want to stab me.

480
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,913
- I mean, that's
a very positive way of

481
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,697
looking at things, but yeah.
- Thank you.

482
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:05,526
Ha ha ha ha-ha!
Hoo hoo!

483
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,180
♪ I hit a new level of pain

484
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:09,748
♪ Please keep talkin',
please keep talkin'! ♪

485
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,879
- Okay, look.
I just wanted you

486
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:12,011
to know that I miss you.

487
00:17:12,054 --> 00:17:13,795
- Well, I miss you too dude.

488
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,624
- Great, so can we agree to
see each other like 5% more?

489
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,060
- Deal. Aah!

490
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,063
We're not going to shake on it.

491
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,500
- Yeah, we'll just take
each other at our word.

492
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,198
- Oooh!
That's a knife!

493
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:28,288
That is a knife in my back.
That's so weird to say.

494
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:31,639
There's a knife in my back.

495
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,119
- Boyle, may I speak
with you for a minute?

496
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:34,207
- Sure, I was just googling

497
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,166
"good toys
for normal children."

498
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,603
- Nikolaj may not be a genius,
but he's a very bright child.

499
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:40,170
And on top of that,
you were right.

500
00:17:40,213 --> 00:17:42,172
He's also a very gifted
artist.

501
00:17:42,215 --> 00:17:44,174
Look what he did
to my periodic table.

502
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:46,785
Sure, it's a bit
derivative of Kandinsky,

503
00:17:46,828 --> 00:17:48,265
but the palette shows
an impressive comprehension

504
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:49,527
of color theory.

505
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,920
- And he's good at clouds, too.

506
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:53,183
- Okay.

507
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:55,315
I also wanted to say
I was wrong to imply

508
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,012
that you didn't know
what was best for him.

509
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:58,666
- Oh.

510
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,059
- You're an exceptionally
supportive parent,

511
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:02,583
and I wish my father
had been more like you.

512
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:05,847
- Thank you for saying that.

513
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:07,588
And sir,

514
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:09,938
nothing would make me prouder
than being your big daddy.

515
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,159
- Well, we're off track now.

516
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:14,856
So, uh, good day.

517
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,031
- Hey, guys.

518
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,772
How you feeling, Gina?

519
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:19,078
- Sometimes I feel like a nut,

520
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:20,558
sometimes I don't.

521
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:22,777
Almond Joy's got nuts.

522
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:24,214
Mounds don't.

523
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:25,693
- She's very hopped up
on painkillers.

524
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,608
- Hold up, when did you learn
French,

525
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:28,914
Monsieur L'baguette?

526
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,263
- Oh, as a bébé.

527
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:33,179
- Oh, oui!
Oui, oui, oui, oui.

528
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:35,268
- It actually helps to
play along, I'm assuming.

529
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:36,878
So what's the latest?
Did you catch the perp?

530
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:38,837
- No. I almost had him.

531
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,622
But then he jumped up, grabbed
a flagpole, spun around it

532
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,885
like Spider-Man, and then
flipped out of sight on a roof.

533
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:46,105
It was crazy. Officers
are still patrolling the area.

534
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:47,237
- Oh, my God, that's it.

535
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,629
- That is it!
The treasure is

536
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,588
in the Forest of
Enchanted Secrets!

537
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,329
Let's go!
- No, we can't.

538
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:54,853
We have to stay here and
guard the Amulet of Destiny.

539
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:56,637
- True dat, true dat.

540
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:58,770
- Sarge, call me crazy,
but it almost sounds like

541
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:00,293
whoever stabbed Gina
knew parkour—

542
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:03,340
just like the ex-husband of
that lady from Gina's event.

543
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,255
- Right!
Gina convinced her to leave him

544
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:06,734
and he probably wants revenge.

545
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,693
I'll look into it.
- Okay.

546
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:10,999
- Jake, I cannot wait
for this doctor.

547
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:12,871
Will you please grab
this knife out of my back?

548
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:14,829
Get it!
- Gina, it's already out.

549
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:16,048
- What?

550
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:27,102
- Hello?
- You win.

551
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:28,756
Please help me.
- No.

552
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,105
- What, why?
I learned my lesson.

553
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:31,716
You were right.
- No, you were right.

554
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,109
For the past four hours,
I've been watching you

555
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:35,937
on the security camera.

556
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:37,635
- You have?
That's weird.

557
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,376
- This isn't about me.
- Still seems weird.

558
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,421
- Rosa!
Watching you try to open

559
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,423
that door and fail again

560
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:46,165
and again
and again and again

561
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:47,427
was inspiring!

562
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:49,124
I was trying to teach you
a lesson,

563
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:51,910
and instead,
you taught me a lesson.

564
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:53,346
- Great. What lesson is that?

565
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,393
- There is nothing the human
spirit cannot overcome.

566
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:59,396
So Rosa Diaz,
you are not quitting.

567
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,180
You are gonna open
that door because

568
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:04,792
you are badass and you don't
need help from anyone!

569
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,317
- Yeah. I'm Rosa Diaz.

570
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:11,973
- You can do this, Rosa!

571
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,674
- Uhhhhh!

572
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,719
- She's doing it!

573
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:22,984
Uhhhhhh!

574
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:24,769
- Yes!

575
00:20:24,812 --> 00:20:26,727
- Uhhhhh!

576
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:32,211
- You did it!
- I did it!

577
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:35,214
Oh, that was great!
I love being independent!

578
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:38,304
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Oh, okay, I'll help you.

579
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:40,219
- And then you were like,
"We can use the Amulet

580
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:42,003
to fight
the Queen of Tears!"

581
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:44,310
- I said all of that when I was
on drugs? That's brilliant.

582
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:46,834
- Yeah, we basically came up
with an entire amazing story.

583
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,096
- We should write a movie!
- Yes!

584
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,011
Jake and Gina present,
colon,

585
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:51,361
"The Queen of Tears,"
colon,

586
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:52,884
"Battle for the
Amulet of Destiny."

587
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:55,190
- Colon, Part One,
colon, of Five.

588
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,105
- Oh, get those
sequel profits—smart.

589
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:58,890
- Yerp.
- Oh, here comes Terry.

590
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,022
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Oh, you should be, Terrance.

591
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,198
You almost missed
the surprise we got for you.

592
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:04,417
- Huh, what is it?
- I think you mean,

593
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:06,376
"Who is it?"

594
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:09,814
- Bryant Ungerbert?

595
00:21:09,857 --> 00:21:11,206
- Hello, Terry Jeffords.

596
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,731
It's been far too long,
old friend.

597
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,212
- We did the right thing.

598
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,127
- Yes we did, Gina.
- Who's Gina?

599
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:20,346
- Are you still on drugs?

600
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,827
- Yeeeah.
- Oh, tight.

601
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,829
- Fremulon.

602
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:26,831
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
