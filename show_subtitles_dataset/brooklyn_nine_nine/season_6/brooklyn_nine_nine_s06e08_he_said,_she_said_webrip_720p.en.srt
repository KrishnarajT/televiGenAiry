1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,424
- And now on to new business.
Peralta.

2
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:07,773
There's a case I'd like you
to handle.

3
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:09,384
Methodist Hospital called
this morning.

4
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:11,777
Apparently, a 38-year-old
investment banker

5
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:13,692
was admitted last night
with a broken penis.

6
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:15,346
It looks like—
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,305
There's a finance guy
with a broken dong?

8
00:00:17,348 --> 00:00:19,611
Uh, methinks some
"Wolf of Wall Street" style

9
00:00:19,655 --> 00:00:22,266
shenana-googles have taken
place this day.

10
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,312
Anyone care to wager a guess
as to how this happened?

11
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:25,835
- Yeah, I bet he dipped it
in a pile of cocaine,

12
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,706
got it real numb, and then hit
a croquet ball with it.

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,447
- Totally possible.
- He probably sat on it.

14
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:31,362
- So it got under his butt.
- Happens all the time.

15
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,885
- Sure do.
- Ugh, you guys are horrible.

16
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:34,931
And you're wrong
because he was clearly driving

17
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:36,715
his Bentley naked,
tried to pee out the window,

18
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,328
and was then struck
by a goose on the wang.

19
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:42,373
Is that what happened, sir?
Was he struck by a goose?

20
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,853
- He was actually struck
by a female coworker

21
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:45,637
who claims he attempted
to sexually assault her.

22
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,596
- I really wish you had

23
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:48,858
stopped us
before we started guessing.

24
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,294
- I'm not responsible for that.

25
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:51,687
Now due to
the sensitive subject matter,

26
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,341
I think it makes sense
to partner Peralta with—

27
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:55,256
- Me? Because I'm the best
at sex?

28
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:56,648
- No, Hitchcock.
In fact, you know what?

29
00:00:56,692 --> 00:00:57,736
This isn't your week.

30
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,868
Why don't you take
a few days off?

31
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,304
- Sweet!

32
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:02,698
Have fun working, cucks!
- What?

33
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:04,482
- Captain, I'd like to work
the case with Jake.

34
00:01:04,526 --> 00:01:05,657
I have the time.

35
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,137
I'm three weeks ahead
on my paperwork.

36
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,965
- Fine. Santiago and Peralta,
talk to both parties.

37
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:10,749
Get to the bottom
of this broken penis.

38
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:13,752
- Wait. I just want
to say I think it's sad

39
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:15,928
that we as a society can
no longer laugh at the phrase

40
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:18,409
"broken penis,"
and it is my dream

41
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,891
that we one day shall again.
Team Broken Penis on three.

42
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,762
One, two, three—
- Broken penis!

43
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:25,286
- Yeah, probably should've
seen that coming.

44
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:47,308
- Mr. Haggerty,
please have a seat.

45
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:52,791
Oh, you can stand
if that's more comfortable.

46
00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:54,358
- No, it's cool.

47
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:56,317
The doctor said I need
to change positions

48
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,057
frequently so I don't form
a penile clot.

49
00:01:58,101 --> 00:02:00,451
- Oh, I'm not gonna barf,
so on that note,

50
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,019
please explain the events
that led to your diaper.

51
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:04,455
- So last night I was giving
my coworker,

52
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,717
Keri, some pointers
on her trades.

53
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:07,676
Told her "lever up on VTC.

54
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,460
There's no fat tail
on the vol's wicked low."

55
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,940
I just didn't want her
to chump it.

56
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:13,377
- Right, and you spoke that way
because you were...

57
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,944
snowboarding?
- No, we were in my office.

58
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,467
- Yeah.
- Anyway, she just flipped out

59
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,773
and hit me
with my favorite golf club.

60
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:19,514
- Ms. Brennan is claiming
she attacked you

61
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:21,516
in self-defense after you
sexually assaulted her.

62
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,344
- Yeah,
because she's crazy.

63
00:02:23,387 --> 00:02:25,389
I know we're not supposed
to say that about women.

64
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:27,609
I usually wouldn't go there
because I'm a huge advocate.

65
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:29,741
I mean, I'm the kind of guy
who thinks Kathryn Bigelow

66
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:31,134
should direct
the next "Star Wars."

67
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,484
I've said that out loud
to other men.

68
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,138
- Thank you, Mr. Haggerty.
We'll be in touch.

69
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:37,836
- Great, thanks.
I'm gonna stand up now.

70
00:02:40,796 --> 00:02:43,102
- Captain, sorry to interrupt.

71
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:45,496
I just got off the phone with
the Department of Corrections.

72
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,021
They wanted me to let you know
that Ernest Zumowski died.

73
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:50,675
- My goodness.

74
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,503
It's been a while
since I've heard that name.

75
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,113
I hunted him for years

76
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:57,987
and finally caught him and put
an end to his bloodlust.

77
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,513
In some sick way, I am who I am
because of Ernest Zumowski

78
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,081
AKA—
all: The Disco Strangler.

79
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,865
- Oh, so you knew
who I was talking about?

80
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:08,432
- Yeah, sir, you talk
about him a lot.

81
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:10,565
- You know, the yo-yo was his—
all: Calling card.

82
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,871
- Oh, I mentioned that too?
So how'd he die?

83
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,482
- He was in
a prison transport van,

84
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:16,048
and he got in
a terrible accident.

85
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,963
It burst into flames,
and he was trapped inside.

86
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:22,751
Well, well, well,
he finally did it.

87
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:25,536
- Died horribly?
- Escaped.

88
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,886
Just like he said he would
all those years ago.

89
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,497
- I'll be coming back for you.

90
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,022
I'm just like disco, baby.
I will never die.

91
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:36,460
- True, disco will never die,
but you will—

92
00:03:36,504 --> 00:03:38,419
all: In your cell, punk.

93
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:40,986
- Oh, so I've told that part
of the story as well?

94
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,467
- Yes, at every
Christmas party.

95
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,121
- Sir, I am the first to tout

96
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:46,992
the capabilities
of senior citizens.

97
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:48,603
I have made love to many,

98
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,082
but the Disco Strangler
is over 80.

99
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:52,084
I doubt that he could pull off
an escape like this.

100
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,869
- Oh, that's what he wants you
to think.

101
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:55,566
You're both
underestimating him.

102
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,568
I know 28 other people
who did that,

103
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,048
and they all ended up
with yo-yos

104
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:00,571
around their throats.
both: Necks.

105
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,094
- Nope, I said "throats,"
not necks,

106
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:04,749
which means I haven't told
that story too many times.

107
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:07,491
All right, lace up
your dancing shoes

108
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:11,669
because it's time to catch
this disco bastard.

109
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:13,715
- Thank you for coming in,
Ms. Brennan.

110
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,804
Can you describe your working
relationship with Mr. Haggerty?

111
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:18,241
- Absolutely.
Seth hired me three years ago

112
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:20,765
to help with large-scale
statistical arbitrage

113
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:23,072
and ever since we've been
at a steady 18% yield.

114
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,421
- I didn't know most
of those words,

115
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,770
but I'm assuming it means
you're good at business.

116
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:27,946
- I am good.
I brought in $168 million

117
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,252
to the firm last quarter.

118
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:30,775
- Wow, that's a lot of money.

119
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:32,777
Where do you keep it all?
It's in a computer.

120
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:34,170
I've watched
too much "DuckTales."

121
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:35,954
- No, you can never watch
too much "DuckTales."

122
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:37,956
It's my dream to have
a gold coin pool.

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,741
- Like Scrooge McD. Continue.
- Look.

124
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:41,743
I love my job,
and I'm really good at it.

125
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:44,136
I would never do anything
to jeopardize what I have,

126
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,921
and I'm not a violent person,

127
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:47,966
but last night
Seth crossed a line.

128
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,968
- Can you tell us
what happened?

129
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:52,971
- I was working late, and
he called me into his office.

130
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:54,538
He had clearly been drinking,

131
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:56,061
and before I knew it,
he pushed me into a desk

132
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:57,715
and he tried to
take my clothes off.

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,500
So I grabbed
his stupid golf club

134
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:00,805
and I hit him
in the Cookie Monster,

135
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,546
which is what he calls
his penis, by the way.

136
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,634
- Gross.
- He's the worst.

137
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,157
My only regret is that
I didn't get

138
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,203
in two extra whacks
for each of his testicles.

139
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:08,552
- What does he call those?
Bert and Ernie?

140
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:09,597
- You are actually correct.

141
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,250
- Ugh, I hate
that I got that right.

142
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:12,643
- So in conclusion:

143
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,689
the burns on Zumowski's body
are consistent

144
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,255
with a massive vehicle fire.

145
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,910
- If this even is his body.
- Excuse me?

146
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:21,130
- We're talking about
the Disco Strangler—

147
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:23,175
a serial killer,
who for six years

148
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,830
stayed one step ahead
of the entire NYPD.

149
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:27,832
- Not sure he had many steps
left in him, sir.

150
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:29,268
Take a look.
- Aw.

151
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:32,097
He looks fragile and sweet.
- Sweet as poison pie.

152
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:34,056
Were you able to match
the dental records

153
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:36,319
to the Disco Strangler?
- No, the body had no teeth.

154
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:38,016
- Well, that's suspicious.
- Not really.

155
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,583
Zumowski didn't have
any teeth either.

156
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:41,759
- Due to him being very old?
- Yes.

157
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:44,675
- What about the fact that
this corpse is 71 inches tall

158
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,808
when the Disco Strangler
was 76?

159
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,026
- He shrank over time.

160
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,201
- Is that another
old person thing?

161
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,855
- Yes, it is.
Another old person thing.

162
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,727
- Mm-hmm.
- We also have a DNA match

163
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,902
between hair on the head

164
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:55,207
of this body
and the Disco Strangler.

165
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:56,861
- Sir, this is clearly
Zumowski.

166
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:58,167
And that's a good thing.

167
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,908
You can finally say good-bye
to your nemesis.

168
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,213
- Thanks, sergeant.
That's a nice thought.

169
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:03,085
For an idiot to have.
Look at this.

170
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:04,303
- A dirty little string?

171
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,870
- Oh, it's not just
any old string.

172
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:08,612
It's a yo-yo string, the most
dangerous part of the yo-yo.

173
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:10,092
The Strangler wanted me
to find this.

174
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,617
He's out there,
and he's taunting me.

175
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:16,794
- Okay, Ms. Brennan,
we've discussed it,

176
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:18,622
and we think
you should file charges

177
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,711
against Mr. Haggerty
for sexual assault.

178
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,584
Now, I'm not gonna lie to you,
it's a difficult process—

179
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,716
- Actually, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

180
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,109
I don't wanna press charges.

181
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:29,111
The firm just offered me
$2.5 million

182
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:31,592
if I sign an NDA
and let this slide.

183
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:33,855
- Wait, so you're gonna let
Seth get off scot-free?

184
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:35,073
- Well, that money would go
a long way

185
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:36,901
towards the Scrooge pool.
Sorry, ignore me.

186
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:38,337
"DuckTales." Woo-oo.
- I mean, I think

187
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:39,904
I have to take it.

188
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,732
This is a "he said, she said,"
situation.

189
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,299
I know how that goes down.

190
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:45,867
No one's gonna convict him
on my word alone.

191
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,999
The system's as broken
as Seth's dong.

192
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,914
- No, it's not.
I'm the system.

193
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,394
And I'm nothing like
Seth's dong.

194
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:53,222
- It feels like we can move off
this analogy.

195
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,180
- Just don't sign that NDA
right now.

196
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:56,921
Give us a chance to bring
this guy to justice.

197
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:58,227
- And how are you gonna
do that?

198
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,924
- By working our asses off
to find proof

199
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,709
that he assaulted you,
and when we do,

200
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:03,362
he will go to jail
for what he did.

201
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:06,627
I really think we can get him.

202
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:11,327
- Okay.
Yeah, let's do this.

203
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:16,854
- Oh, man, I'm reading
Keri's statement.

204
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:18,464
If I was a woman,
I would not work in finance.

205
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:21,293
- Oh, because it's so easy
for women everywhere else.

206
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,860
- Okay, I can tell
that I am in trouble.

207
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:24,035
- You're not in trouble.

208
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,602
I just don't think
that men understand

209
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,909
how different everything is
for us.

210
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:29,867
I can think of a million
examples from this week alone.

211
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:31,129
- Oh, sick!

212
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:32,827
- Oh,
sick!

213
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,219
- Have a great day.
- Oh, thanks.

214
00:07:34,263 --> 00:07:35,612
You too.
- Mm-hmm.

215
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,136
You have a beautiful mouth.
Have a great day.

216
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,790
- Excuse me, Miss,
do you know where

217
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,313
I can find a police officer?

218
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:43,228
Uh, sir, you're
a police officer, right?

219
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:44,882
- Yeah, I'm a detective.
- Oh, thank God.

220
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:46,275
- I'm in uniform!

221
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:47,580
- Oh, that's why you
yelled that.

222
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:48,930
I thought you were just excited

223
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:50,453
about your general love
of uniforms.

224
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:52,324
- Usually when I yell that,
it is because of my love

225
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:54,631
of uniforms but not today.

226
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,502
Today it was because
of that sexist jerk.

227
00:07:56,546 --> 00:08:00,028
- God, how many creeps have
I not noticed before—oh, no.

228
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:02,030
The fruit seller guy on
our corner, is he a creep?

229
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:04,510
- No, he's a real gentleman,
which is surprising

230
00:08:04,554 --> 00:08:06,512
because he's always holding
those two cantaloupes

231
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:08,950
and the opportunity to be gross
is right there.

232
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:10,342
- Is it? I've never even
noticed that before.

233
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:12,431
I never wanted to make
a comment or anything

234
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:15,043
like that and thought better.
Anyways.

235
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:17,001
I am genuinely very sorry

236
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:18,873
that this is something you have
to go through all the time.

237
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,526
- It's okay.
I'm used to it.

238
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,963
- That's even sadder.

239
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:24,052
- I know.
But you know what's not sad?

240
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:25,531
That Keri didn't take
that insane amount

241
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:26,881
of hush money,
and now we get

242
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,447
to put a bad guy in jail.
- Amen.

243
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,188
- Wait, her firm offered her
a big deal and you told her

244
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:31,320
not to take it?
- Yeah.

245
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:32,538
Because that would mean letting

246
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:33,844
a sexual assaulter go free.

247
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,019
- Do you have
any physical evidence

248
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,499
to prove that he did it?
- No.

249
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,022
- So it sounds like he might
go free anyway.

250
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:39,284
I mean, at least
if she takes the deal,

251
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:40,546
she won't walk away
with nothing.

252
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,939
- I'm surprised you feel
like that.

253
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,158
You're such a feminist.

254
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,333
- I feel like maybe
I shouldn't be here.

255
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:45,638
- I am a feminist,
but I'm also a realist.

256
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:46,944
I'm just looking out
for the victim.

257
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:48,032
- Or should I be here
because men

258
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:49,512
should be part
of the conversation?

259
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:51,166
- Let's say best case scenario
you do find evidence.

260
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:53,211
She's still gonna have to go
through a very public trial

261
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:54,909
where they drag her name
through the mud.

262
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,258
Even if she wins,
she still loses.

263
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,563
It's two steps forward,
one step back.

264
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:58,869
- I've landed
on active listening.

265
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,131
I will no longer be chiming in.

266
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:01,872
- Yeah, but when one person
comes forward,

267
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,308
it inspires others to speak up.

268
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:05,049
And that's a hell
of a lot better than taking

269
00:09:05,093 --> 00:09:07,008
a deal that lets
sexual predators walk free.

270
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,661
- Dude, obviously, I get that.

271
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:11,490
I'm just saying, remember that
there's a very real woman here

272
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,362
whose career and life
are gonna be affected

273
00:09:13,405 --> 00:09:14,929
by you pursuing this case.

274
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,279
I'm just saying,
consider what's best for her.

275
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,112
- All right, the state police
is deploying 30 men

276
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:26,375
and four helicopters to comb
the area of the accident.

277
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:28,072
I felt comfortable saying

278
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:32,424
this disco-man has danced
his last disco dance.

279
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:35,514
- Sir, it's fun to see you
breaking out the old lingo,

280
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:37,386
but do you think
you're jumping the gun?

281
00:09:37,429 --> 00:09:39,605
All the evidence points to
the Strangler being dead.

282
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:41,390
- Not all the evidence.
- Right.

283
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,480
The random piece of thread
you think is a yo-yo string.

284
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:45,611
- It is a yo-yo string.

285
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:47,526
The most dangerous part
of the yo-yo.

286
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,137
- It just feels like you're
trying to relive

287
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,095
your glory days.
- Absurd.

288
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:53,271
- Well, what do you have
in that box over there?

289
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:56,187
- Memories and keepsakes
of my greatest cases.

290
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:58,668
both: Mm-hmm.
- To remind me

291
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:00,235
of the Strangler's MO.

292
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:01,758
He always seduced an accomplice

293
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,108
into doing
his fiendish bidding.

294
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:05,936
I bet it was the van driver.

295
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,590
- You mean the woman
who was thrown violently

296
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,635
from the vehicle
and just barely survived?

297
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,247
- Yeah, I'm sure she was very
"badly injured."

298
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,553
- Sorry if my voice is raspy.

299
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:16,468
They just took
the breathing tube out.

300
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:18,644
- But they left the BS in?
- Good God.

301
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:20,124
- Whoa.
- So, Ms. Park,

302
00:10:20,168 --> 00:10:22,648
it says in my file
that you drove Mr. Zumowski

303
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:24,563
on multiple occasions.
- Yes.

304
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:27,131
Because he had to go
to the hospital a lot.

305
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:28,785
He was very, very old.

306
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,482
- She's clearly been seduced.
- She has?

307
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,484
- Let's cut the crap.
You helped him escape.

308
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,659
You planted a cadaver
in the back.

309
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:35,183
You flipped the van on purpose.

310
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:36,662
Then the Strangler set it
on fire

311
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,621
and sprinkled some
of his hair nearby

312
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,144
so there'd be a DNA match.

313
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:42,146
Then he left behind
his calling card:

314
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,192
this yo-yo string!

315
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,281
- That's not a yo-yo string.
- What?

316
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:49,023
- That's part of the lanyard
we give to the older inmates

317
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,460
when they become fall risks.
- You're lying.

318
00:10:51,503 --> 00:10:53,375
You've succumbed
to his groovy voodoo!

319
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:54,985
- Sir, I don't think
she's lying.

320
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,291
Look at this photo
from the file.

321
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:57,640
- Oh, my goodness.

322
00:10:57,683 --> 00:11:01,035
So this string
is just a string?

323
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,819
The DNA was really a match?

324
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,778
The Disco Strangler
is actually dead.

325
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:10,740
And that chapter of my life
is forever closed.

326
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,786
Well, that's...

327
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,224
fantastic news.

328
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:18,008
- Okay, we have you
set up here.

329
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,662
We have a VR experience
down the hall

330
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:21,751
where you can fly like a bird,
and if you need anything else

331
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:24,623
just buzz and one
of our butlers will assist you.

332
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,713
- This place is amazing.
It's like a dream factory.

333
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,150
- We're investigating
a sexual assault

334
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,238
that occurred in these offices.

335
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:31,543
- Right, of course.
I know.

336
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:33,371
This is how people get tempted
by the devil.

337
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:35,591
I see what you're up to,
platter of tiny quiches.

338
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:38,202
- We need to get
someone on the record

339
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:39,682
about Seth's
patterned behaviors.

340
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:41,727
I think if we start with—

341
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:43,555
How many tiny quiches
do you have in your mouth?

342
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,557
- Five.
I'll swallow them.

343
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,472
Let's just start
the interviews.

344
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:49,518
- I don't think something like
that would happen here.

345
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,215
It's an extremely professional
workplace,

346
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,695
and Seth's a really good guy.

347
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:54,610
I don't think he's even ever
bought a prostitute before.

348
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:56,133
- Is that the minimum
requirement for being

349
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,092
a good guy these days?
- Can I go?

350
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,268
Beefer's birthday's starting
and a bunch of Mets are here.

351
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,530
- Present day or '86?

352
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,532
- Both.
- I'm gonna escort him back.

353
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:04,794
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

354
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:06,535
Seth has never been
inappropriate with me.

355
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:08,102
He's a really good guy.

356
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:10,104
Honestly, this is an extremely
professional workplace.

357
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,323
- Dude, Beefer just puked in
the koi pond.

358
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:15,152
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize
the cop thing was in here.

359
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:17,285
This is an extremely
professional workplace,

360
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:18,808
and Seth is a really good guy.

361
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:21,550
- Hey, I'm Beefer.
It's my birthday.

362
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:23,204
- Yeah, we heard.
- Happy Birthday, Beefer.

363
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:24,770
- Beefer's not my real name.

364
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:26,729
They just call me that 'cause
I beefed on my first day.

365
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:28,209
- Okay, but for the record,
no one asked.

366
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,254
- I don't have anything bad
to say about Seth.

367
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:31,690
He's a really good guy,

368
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,432
and this office is...
what's the word?

369
00:12:34,476 --> 00:12:36,782
both: Extremely professional.
- Yes!

370
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:39,437
- Hello, Sergeant Santiago
and Detective Peralta.

371
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:41,874
I'm the Deputy General Counsel
here at the firm.

372
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,702
I can only assume
your questioning has revealed

373
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:45,835
nothing negative
about Mr. Haggerty's character.

374
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,445
- Only because you told them
exactly what to say.

375
00:12:47,489 --> 00:12:48,838
- We did no such thing.

376
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,319
These allegations of
sexual assault are ridiculous.

377
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:53,495
- If they're so ridiculous,
then why offer Keri Brennan

378
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:54,931
hush money?
- That wasn't hush money.

379
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,673
That was a benevolent gesture
to allow Ms. Brennan

380
00:12:57,716 --> 00:12:59,544
to get the professional help
she so clearly needs.

381
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:01,894
However, since she has chosen
to pursue this matter

382
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,680
with the police, that deal
is now null and void.

383
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,334
Furthermore,
we are terminating her.

384
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:07,639
both: What?
- We have a zero

385
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:09,380
tolerance policy
for violence here.

386
00:13:09,424 --> 00:13:10,773
And unlike Ms. Brennan,

387
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:12,818
Mr. Haggerty has actual
evidence of an assault.

388
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:15,125
- He's talking
about my broken penis.

389
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,822
- Yeah, Seth, we know.

390
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,262
- Hey, you never came home
last night.

391
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:22,524
You doing okay?
- No, I'm a mess.

392
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,829
I miss Hitchcock.
- What?

393
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:25,570
I was obviously talking to Amy.

394
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,050
- Oh, and who's talking
to Scully?

395
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:29,879
No one.
Come on, sandwich.

396
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,968
- Ames, you've been working
yourself to the bone

397
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,926
on this case
for three days straight.

398
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,798
Now, I'm starting to worry
about you.

399
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,800
- I have to solve this case,
Jake.

400
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:39,715
Otherwise Keri lost
the settlement

401
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:41,978
and the job that she loves
because of me,

402
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,545
just like Rosa said.

403
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,896
But I can't find anything.

404
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,985
I've read through three years
of Seth's emails,

405
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,901
and it's mostly inquiries about
where he could buy a Batmobile.

406
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:53,903
- Tah, so stupid,
but did he find one?

407
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:56,079
Is it like at a dealership
or something? Never mind.

408
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:59,604
Look, I know this sucks,
and I hate to say it,

409
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,302
but we both know
sometimes you work a case

410
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:02,912
and you just don't
have the evidence.

411
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:06,046
- This isn't just a case
for me.

412
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,701
When I was a rookie
at the Six-Four,

413
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:11,921
my captain was my first mentor.

414
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,618
He helped me get
on the detective track,

415
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:16,752
and he gave me
all the best cases.

416
00:14:16,795 --> 00:14:20,147
But when I finally
made detective,

417
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,888
he took me to dinner
and tried to kiss me.

418
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:26,327
He said that he felt like
he deserved something

419
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,156
in return for my career.

420
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,592
I just

421
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:33,725
ran out of the restaurant
back to the office,

422
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,206
and I put in my transfer
for the Nine-Nine.

423
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,903
- Oh, man.

424
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,733
I'm so sorry.

425
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,955
- I never told anyone
because I felt like

426
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,392
maybe I didn't actually deserve
my promotion.

427
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:51,656
And I worried that I wouldn't
get anymore promotions

428
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,963
if I spoke up, so...

429
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:55,660
- God.

430
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,620
Every time I think I understand
how bad it is,

431
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:00,709
it's just way worse
than I imagined.

432
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:02,145
- This kind of stuff
has happened

433
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:05,670
to literally
every woman I know.

434
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:09,021
I just wanted to help make it
better for this one woman.

435
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:17,160
- Okay.
- Wait, where are you going?

436
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:19,336
- I'm gonna go get you a change
of clothes and a coffee.

437
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,338
We're not giving up.

438
00:15:21,382 --> 00:15:23,253
- Okay.

439
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,125
Hey, what if we reach out

440
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:27,170
to all the coworkers again,
privately?

441
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:28,432
Maybe they didn't talk to us

442
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,042
because we interviewed them
in their office.

443
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:31,914
- I think that's a great idea.
I'll be right back.

444
00:15:31,957 --> 00:15:33,742
Oh, I'm also gonna grab a comb,

445
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:36,353
but you don't have to use it
unless you decide.

446
00:15:36,397 --> 00:15:38,181
- Okay, babe.

447
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:39,835
- Sir,

448
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:41,706
you haven't come out
of your office in a while.

449
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,013
How are you doing?
- Terrible. You were right.

450
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:47,059
I was trying
to relive my glory years,

451
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:49,671
but the fact remains,
they are behind me.

452
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:52,195
My only nemesis now...

453
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,893
Father Time.

454
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:56,895
- Come on, sir.
That's ridiculous.

455
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,245
You're on the cutting edge.

456
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,550
In fact, you're so progressive,

457
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:01,248
they were scared to make you
Police Commissioner.

458
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,206
You're as modern as they come.

459
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,816
What is that noise?

460
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,949
It's my fax machine.
- Oh, Captain.

461
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,475
- Zowie. I'm young!
- What is it?

462
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,695
- It's an aerial photograph
from one of the helicopters

463
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:16,132
I had deployed.
Take a gander, boys.

464
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,352
It's him.
The Disco Strangler.

465
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,310
- Oh, my God.
You were right.

466
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,921
- Of course I was.
I know him better than anyone.

467
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,228
We're two sides of the same—
all: Coin!

468
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:26,925
- You've told us this story
many times.

469
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:29,014
- And you'll hear it again!

470
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,234
- So we're meeting a guy
named Steve.

471
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:33,105
He said he couldn't speak
openly with us

472
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,759
when we met him
in the conference room.

473
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,326
- Steve?
I don't remember a Steve.

474
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,110
Who's Steve?
- I am.

475
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:39,938
both: Beefer?

476
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,071
So your real name is Steve?
- Yeah, I hate it.

477
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:44,116
Makes me sound like a douche.
- Yeah, Beefer's better.

478
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,814
- So why'd you agree
to meet with us?

479
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:47,903
- I wanted to show you
this text chain between Seth

480
00:16:47,946 --> 00:16:50,862
and some of the guys
in the office.

481
00:16:50,906 --> 00:16:54,388
- Whoa, Seth describes the
night exactly like Keri did.

482
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,738
And then he writes
"LOLZ, Epic Fail."

483
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,392
What's this GIF he sent?

484
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,829
- Oh, that's Kelsey Grammer
falling off a stage.

485
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:02,744
- I was really torn

486
00:17:02,787 --> 00:17:04,485
about whether or not
I should send this to you guys

487
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:06,269
but then I thought about it
for a long time

488
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:08,445
and realized it was
the right thing to do.

489
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:10,969
- Oh, who would have guessed
Beefer's a secret feminist.

490
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,450
- No, gross. I meant it was
the right thing to do for me.

491
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:14,843
- Huh?
- If they fire Seth,

492
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:16,410
I take his job.
- Okay.

493
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,933
Well, we got
what we needed here.

494
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:19,108
So I think we're gonna leave

495
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:20,414
before you ruin the moment
any further.

496
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,502
- Sweet. I'll send it to ya.

497
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,068
Thanks for the promosh, narks.

498
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,941
- You're the nark.

499
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,249
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

500
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:32,164
- All right, people,
your suspect's name

501
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:36,473
is Ernest Zumowski, better
known as the Disco Strangler.

502
00:17:36,517 --> 00:17:38,214
Take a close look.

503
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,216
This is the most dangerous man
in America.

504
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,784
5'8", hunched over, 93 pounds

505
00:17:42,827 --> 00:17:44,481
with gray hair
and blue-gray skin.

506
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:46,788
If you encounter him,
keep your distance.

507
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,572
- All due respect, sir,
seems like a lot of manpower

508
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:50,095
to take down
one sweet-looking old man.

509
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,315
- Oh, he's sweet, all right.
Sweet as poison pie.

510
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,143
- Yeah,
don't underestimate him!

511
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:55,884
I know 28 other people
who did that,

512
00:17:55,927 --> 00:17:58,278
and they all have yo-yos
swinging from their throats.

513
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,105
- So you were listening.
- Yeah, we were saying that

514
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:01,803
all along.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

515
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,544
All right, troops.
Travel in twos.

516
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:06,590
Keep your eyes open,
and for God's sake,

517
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:08,244
protect the neck.

518
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09,985
- Hey, Keri.

519
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:12,596
Great news: the DA's going to
press charges against Haggerty.

520
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,251
- I heard. That's awesome.
Thank you, guys.

521
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,036
- Hey, what's with the boxes?
Moving to a better desk?

522
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,212
- With a better butler and
more of those mini quiches?

523
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:23,215
- No, I'm taking my stuff home.
I had to quit.

524
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:27,350
both: Whaaat?

525
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,355
- What do you mean, you quit?
Are they forcing you out?

526
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,704
Because that's illegal.
- No, they're not.

527
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,402
But the whole atmosphere
here has changed.

528
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,969
Everybody looks at me like I'm
either a victim or a trader.

529
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:41,233
I mean, I'm not even on any
of the non-work group texts.

530
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:43,323
And last night Beefer invited
everybody over

531
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:45,542
for whiskey and cigars,
and I wasn't included.

532
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:47,370
- Well, I mean,
is not hanging out

533
00:18:47,414 --> 00:18:49,851
with Beefer really
a punishment, per se?

534
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,418
- Yeah, but if I'm not
at Beefer's

535
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:53,376
for whiskey and cigars,
then I don't get invited

536
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,899
to Vegas with Slurpie
and Trundle,

537
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:56,945
and I'm definitely not
at Skidmark's pig roast.

538
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,599
- Man, these nicknames
are just bad.

539
00:18:58,642 --> 00:18:59,904
- I actually came up
with Skidmark.

540
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:01,732
It's very funny
if you know the back story.

541
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,517
- He pooped his pants?
- Yeah.

542
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,780
But the point is,
if I'm not at those events,

543
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:08,391
then suddenly I'm not looked
at for new accounts

544
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:11,829
or promotions or anything.
My career here is over.

545
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,918
- I'm really sorry.
I feel like a messed up.

546
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:15,572
I shouldn't have talked you
into turning down

547
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:18,358
that settlement.
- Hey, Seth attacked me.

548
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:19,968
And I'm really proud of myself

549
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,709
that I didn't let him
get away with that.

550
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:24,581
So, even though it sucks,
if I had to do it all again,

551
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,453
I would.

552
00:19:26,496 --> 00:19:29,630
Especially the broken penis.

553
00:19:29,673 --> 00:19:32,763
- Why'd she say that to me?
- I don't know.

554
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:40,684
- Freeze! NYPD!

555
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:42,425
- Is that Raymond Holt I see?

556
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:43,774
You haven't changed a bit.

557
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:46,298
- Neither have you, Ernest.
- What?

558
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:48,692
- Neither have you,
Ernest.

559
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:49,954
- What?

560
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:53,654
Neither have you, Ernest!

561
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:55,438
- Ugh, this is hard to watch.

562
00:19:55,482 --> 00:19:57,440
- You're just as devious
as ever.

563
00:19:57,484 --> 00:19:58,963
You seduced the van driver,
didn't you?

564
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:00,791
- No, I seduced the van driver.

565
00:20:00,835 --> 00:20:03,446
She couldn't resist
my groovy voodoo.

566
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,362
- And the yo-yo string
was a message.

567
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:10,366
- The what was a what?
- The yo-yo string was—

568
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,498
- Captain, this is
embarrassing.

569
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,064
Can we just take him in?

570
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,545
- Yeah, you're right.
This isn't what I hoped for.

571
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,460
Go ahead and cuff him, gently.

572
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:19,854
- This isn't the last you'll
hear from me, Raymond.

573
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:21,769
I'm never gonna die.
- Sure you won't.

574
00:20:21,812 --> 00:20:24,380
Whatever makes you feel better.
- No, you're the punk.

575
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,077
- Just put him in the car.

576
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,038
- Hey, heard you guys got
that finance creep.

577
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,561
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

578
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,084
But there's nothing
to congratulate me about.

579
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:35,739
- Amy's just upset because
the historically entrenched

580
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:37,828
patriarchy has created
a culture of victim-shaming

581
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,875
that suppresses any power shift
in our masculo-phallic system.

582
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:42,354
- Huh?
- I couldn't sleep last night

583
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:44,095
so I watched a documentary
on Netflix about feminism.

584
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:45,575
- I love you.

585
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,882
Just sucks that she came
forward to report an assault

586
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,492
and the only one
who truly benefited

587
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:51,668
is a guy named Beefer.
- You don't know Beefer but—

588
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:53,061
- Oh, I've met plenty
of Beefers.

589
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:54,454
- Yeah.
- Look this is a hard fight.

590
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:55,803
But it's an important one.

591
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:57,108
It's good that you convinced
her to press charges.

592
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:58,588
- But she lost the money,
and she had to quit

593
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,807
the job she loves.

594
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,417
That's exactly what you
said would happen.

595
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,506
- But you got the guy
who assaulted her.

596
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,073
And look over there.

597
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:07,728
- Keri's coworker?
- She came forward to report

598
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:09,425
an assault because she was
inspired by Keri,

599
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,079
which is exactly
what you said would happen.

600
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:15,039
Two steps forward, one step
back is still one step forward.

601
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,781
You wanna take
her statement together?

602
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:20,915
- You know it, sister.
- Yeah, don't do that.

603
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,004
- We can be different
and still have the same cause.

604
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,008
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
