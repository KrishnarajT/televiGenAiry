00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:06,420
- Guys! I have a great
idea for a prank.

Before Holt comes in

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,554
I'm gonna put ink on the podium
where he puts his hands.

4
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:10,685
- I don't think
he'll fall for that.

5
00:00:10,729 --> 00:00:11,860
- I did!
- How?

6
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:13,035
I haven't even
opened this yet.

7
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,689
- I guess it's unrelated.

8
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,125
- Captain Holt hates pranks.
This is gonna backfire, man.

9
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:17,779
- Ugh, fine, I'll tone it down.
I'll...

10
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:19,390
move his podium
a foot to the left.

11
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:20,652
- What?
He'll be so angry.

12
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:21,653
- Okay, five inches.
- Five?

13
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:22,654
- Three?
- Three?

14
00:00:22,697 --> 00:00:23,959
- One?
- One?

15
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,352
- All right.
I'll move it a half inch.

16
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:26,527
- Fine.
It's your funeral.

17
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:28,486
- Oh my god.

18
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,748
Worst prank ever.
So stupid.

19
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,315
Holt's not even
going to notice.

20
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,101

I'll tell you
the entire story tonight.

I love you as well.
Goodbye.

Oh, that was a fun
several moments.

34
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,583
So, there's been
a series of homicides.

35
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:24,542
Three victims, all young men,

36
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,457
each murdered
in their own fashion.

37
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,719
- A serial killer?
How'd they do it?

38
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:29,677
Strangled? Mangled?
Hung, i.e. dangled?

39
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:30,765
- Their bodies
were disfigured.

40
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:31,897
- I.e. "mangled."
Continue.

41
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,115
- Our killer
cut the victims open

42
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,377
and ripped out their hearts.

43
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:35,509
Now, before I
assign this case—

44
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,902
- Five dollars!
- What?

45
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:38,294
- I'm bidding for it.
I want this so badly.

46
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,426
- That's not how we—
- $20.

47

Just to make this interesting.

48
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,734
- $100 for Jake to have it!
- I was going to assign

49
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:44,910
the case to you and Peralta
but perhaps I should

50
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:46,651
give it to Diaz instead.
- $200!

51

the money, Boyle!

I need this case handled
professionally and maturely.

I haven't acted professionally.

from spilling my juice!

Look, we can handle this, sir.

Do we joke around sometimes?
Yes, but when it's time

to buckle down,
we're seasoned professionals.

60

the Spice Boys.

and they won't.

Sir, I swear,
give us a chance.

63

This says there's
not enough money

Okay, so whoever did this,

00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:05,773
they weren't careful
with the organs.

96
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:08,254
They just sorta grabbed
whatever and yanked.

00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:10,473
- Title of your sex tape.
Oh, that's just something

98
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:11,953
we say back at the Nine-Nine.

99
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,520
- Interesting, 'cause around
here sex tape is what

100
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:16,523
we call the adhesive you use
to reattach a severed penis.

101
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,394

pick some of that up.

- Why?
- Anyway...

00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:23,182
most of the killer's incisions
are very sloppy but then once

104
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:25,271
he gets to the heart
they become very careful.

105
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:28,230

That's a clean cut.

a status update on the case.

I'm puttin' the screws to ya.
No, I just popped in

112
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,112

solve these murders immediately

113
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:42,810

serious consequences.

directly to the NYPD?

Yes, I'm familiar with...
HotClues.

121
00:03:58,043 --> 00:03:59,697
- Great!
You know, it's actually

122
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,090
helped us solve 17 cases,
so I think we should ask

123
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:03,614
for the public's help
with this one.

124
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,746
- No, study after study has
shown that soliciting

125
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,923
anonymous tips results in false
leads and wrongful convictions.

126
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:10,272
- Hmm.
Tell me how you really feel.

127
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,753
- I did.
- And I loved it! Such passion!

128
00:04:12,797 --> 00:04:14,233
But I think HotClues
could help us here.

129
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,496
- No, we will solve
this case the proper way

130

with actual police work
conducted by the two best

131
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,154

your methods work.

For the sake
of your careers.

pretty good about it.

Where you really going?
- No, I'm serious. Staten!

you out of New York?

147

- It's part of the City!

148
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,884
- Is it, though?
- Hey, Staten Island is great.

Any breakthroughs?

160
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,823
- Uh, well, we're still
in the early stages.

161
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,651
- Do you have a suspect
or DNA evidence?

162

- Oh my god.
I wish.

this to prove to that idiot

and useless his little app is.

I can assure you my feelings

168
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,186
about John Kelly
are purely professional.

00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,715
from "The Durrells in Corfu"
rolling her eyes.

173
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:46,107

175
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:48,762
- Wait, the group
text thread is back?

176
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,068
- No.
- We misspoke.

177
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:51,591
- Yeah.
- Look, if you can't solve

178
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:53,245
this case I'll reassign
it to someone who can.

179
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,725
- Wait, no, no, no, no, no!
I have an idea.

180
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:56,378
We need to get
into the mind of a sicko.

181
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,905
And the only way to do that is
with the help of another sicko.

184
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:09,043
- Jake!
It's so good to see you!

185
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:11,176
Come give me a hug,
I'm not going to eat you!

186
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,222
Also, don't hug me
'cause I will try to eat you.

187
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,531
- This is such a surprise!

188
00:06:18,574 --> 00:06:19,967
I haven't seen you
since I transferred here.

189
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:21,316
How's Amy?
- She's great!

190
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,188
We're married
and she's a Sergeant now.

00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,972
- Wow!
- Yeah! How's everything here?

Guess who's here? Herman.
- Herman!

194
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:31,283
Always playing Yahtzee,
knew everybody's name.

195
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:32,501
- Worshipped Satan.
- Did he?

196
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:35,069
He never mentioned that.
[laughter]

197
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,637
- He wouldn't shut up about it.
- It is exhausting.

198
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,900
- Well, I'm Charles.
I'm Jake's best friend.

199
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:42,033
Charles, he's serving three
life sentences.

200
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,643
No need to flex.
So Caleb, we're tracking

201
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:46,124
a serial killer
and I was thinking

202
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,865
you could help us
get inside his head.

203
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,127
- Just because I ate humans

204
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,824
doesn't mean that
I'm inhuman, Jake.

205
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,304
- Caleb, come on.
That's not what I meant.

206
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:53,566
- I'm just kidding.

207
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:55,437
I'm probably friends
with the guy online.

208
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,830
[chuckles]
What's his deal?

209
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,267
- Well, he's been
murdering young men

210
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:00,834
and cutting out their hearts.

211
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,053
- Ew.
What?

212
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:03,184
I would never eat a heart.

213
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,664
I stick to the normal stuff.

214
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:05,796
Butts and thighs.

215
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,363
One time I ate a foot,
but it was nasty.

216
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:09,756
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You know what?

217
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,150
There was some weird guy
on the forum recently.

218
00:07:12,193 --> 00:07:13,673
- The forum?
- Yeah, it's a chat room

219
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:15,980
for people who like to talk
about eating human beings

220
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:17,503
but definitely won't act on it.

221
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:19,331
Wink.
Yeah, it's hosted on—

222
00:07:19,374 --> 00:07:20,854
- [together] Reddit.
- Obviously.

223
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,987
Anyways, he showed up from out
of nowhere asking questions

224
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,423
about cutting out hearts.
- Really?

225

Do you know
anything else about him?

226
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:27,252
- I'd never seen him
on there before

227
00:07:27,295 --> 00:07:29,210
but you could check the logs.
I'll approve you.

I'm an admin.
- Ah.

229
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,474
- Oh, you might want to switch
to incognito mode.

230
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,000
Otherwise your targeted ads will
be pretty cannibal-specific.

- Ah, good to know.

00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:38,872
Well, it was good
to see you, Caleb.

233
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,047

Hey Terry, you okay?
You skipped all your lunches.

00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,967
- I'm going through the budget
to see if there's any way

237
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,751
we could save enough money
for me to stay here.

238
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:50,710
- You find anything yet?
- Yeah, we could

239
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:54,409
switch to generic printer ink,
cut down on custodial services,

240
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,368
and stop buying
office birthday cakes.

241
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:58,587
- Over my dead body!
- It's just an idea.

- Well, take it off the table!
- Damn, Scully, fine.

243
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:02,243
- We could stop paying
for an exterminator.

244
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:03,505
It's pointless.
We all have guns.

245
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,029
- Who am I kidding?

246
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:06,552
We'll never save enough
to keep me at the Nine-Nine.

247
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:08,293
- You're right.
The only way to free up

248
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,034
that money
is if you fire someone.

249
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:12,906
- What? I can't just fire
someone without cause.

250
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,908
- Come on.
We all know there's a bunch of

251
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,083
dead weight around here.

00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,781

makes me want to barf.

Let's axe a dud!

00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:24,657
- Damn, Amy.
I am loving this shade on you.

256
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,180
But Loot's right.
We can't just fire somebody.

257
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:29,749
That said, you could
"inspire" somebody to quit.

258
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,012
For example, Broadway Brian.

259
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:34,232
- Yes!
Broadway Brian, of course!

00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,886
- Who the hell
is Broadway Brian?

261

- Brian in records.

262
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:39,759
He's always talking about
what a great singer he is

263
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:41,892
and how his dream
is to be in musicals.

264
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:44,546
You just need to convince him
to go for his dream.

265
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,766
- Oh, I don't know.
That feels underhanded.

00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,420
- It's never underhanded to help
somebody follow their dream.

267
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:49,900
Yesterday,
I was watching "Ellen,"

268
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:51,771
and she had this woman on
who wanted to be a chef,

269
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:53,425
but she didn't have any taste
buds, so she quit her job,

270
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:54,948
hired her best friend
to be her taste tester.

271
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,428
And now they have the best taco
truck in Lansing.

272
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:58,038
It was inspiration as [bleep].

00:08:58,082 --> 00:08:59,474
- Yeah.

00:08:59,518 --> 00:09:01,302
I'd just be helping him
follow his dream!

00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:02,956
I'd be doing him a favor!

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,742
I'm going to inspire Brian's
ass right out of this office!

Commissioner Kelly is back

00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,793
and he found his way here
on his own

281

without any tips
from the public.

282
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,666
How impressive is that?
- Well, thank you, Raymond.

283
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,885
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

284
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,495
Thought I'd check
on your progress.

285
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,671
[phone chimes]
- Um, we have a solid lead.

286
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,325
Suspicious online behavior

287
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:26,545
from someone using the name
Jamburger77.

288
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:28,373
- There's only one person
in the tri-state area

289
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,157
with that surname—
Eileen Jamburger.

290
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:33,247
101 years old, and immediately
racist on the phone.

291
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,770
She is not a suspect
at this time.

292
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,990
- But the user did make
one non-cannibal post.

293
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,820
A negative review of the
headroom in a 2006 Saturn Ion.

294
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,256
- Real creep car.

295
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,606
So, we pulled records
on every 2006 Ion in the city

296
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,130
and we're following up
on them now.

297
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:47,479
- Well, I'll be.

298
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,046
That's some nice police work,
Peralta.

299
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,656
- And Charles.
- I especially like how

300
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,484
you found evidence,
followed up on it,

301
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,312
and it's lead you closer
to a solve.

302
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:56,183
- No, I agree, Peralta.
It's excellent work.

303
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:57,793
- You must've hated
saying that.

304
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:59,839
- No, I didn't.
I like giving compliments.

305
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:02,668
You have a nice deep voice.
It is very commanding.

306
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:05,497
- Cut the crap, John.
You're furious!

307
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,021
And everyone can tell!

308
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,067
- See?
Very commanding.

309
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,505
So, I know Raymond has
some issues with HotClues,

310
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:15,463
but we did put
the call out on the app

311
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,683
and got a very promising tip.

312
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:19,598
- Look, we're not going
against our Captain.

313
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:23,341
- So this guy says
he saw someone covered in blood

314
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:25,082
getting out of a Saturn Ion.

315
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,692
But you don't need that tip

316
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:30,087
because you are among the
best detectives in the NYPD!

317
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,871
[laughter]

318
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:35,440
- You're right,
we don't need that tip!

319
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,050
But seriously,
send us that tip.

320
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,312
We need it.

321
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:39,922
- Hey, Brian!
What are you up to?

322
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:41,750
- Typing in numbers
into a computer.

323
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:44,362
Like I always do endlessly
for 40-60 hours a week.

324
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:45,580
- Well, when you love
what you do,

325
00:10:45,624 --> 00:10:47,321
you don't work
a day in your life!

326
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:49,889
Unless, do you not love
sad data entry?

327
00:10:49,932 --> 00:10:51,673
- Well,
my passion is performing.

328
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,066
I do musical theater.

329
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,850
It's the hardest form of acting.
- I agree!

330
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:57,288
I am always saying,
if you're not singing,

331
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:59,246
you're not acting.
- Right!

332
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,682
- It's probably hard
to audition

333
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,380
because you're always here,
right?

334
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:05,557
- Yes! I had to pass up a chance
to read for "Seussical."

335
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,385
- You know Brian,
this makes me think

336
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:08,734
of something I saw on "Ellen."

337
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:11,389
There was this lady,
she wanted to be a cook,

338
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:13,217
but her tongue
was all messed up,

339
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,350
and she had this friend
who didn't even have a tongue—

340
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:17,830
I mean, she did,

341
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:21,399
and now they own a taco truck
in Lansing!

342
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:22,704
- Huh?

343
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,097
- Follow your dreams, man!

344
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,577
You gotta follow your dreams.

345
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,840
Find your taco truck!

346
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:30,582
- Wow.
Thank you.

347
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,497
That gives me
a lot to think about.

348
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,846
So what did you
come down here for?

349
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,372
- Oh, uh, I had to borrow...

350
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,721
the water cooler!

351
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,680
[grunting] All right.
Thanks, Brian.

352
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:43,377
Think about what I said.

353
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:46,293
- So, the tipster saw
the Saturn parked out back

354
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,599
and the woman at the desk said

355
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:49,122
it belongs to the man
in room 203.

356
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,733
One "Larry Bird."
- Obvious fake name.

357
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,779
- Or is it so insane that
there's no way it's fake?

358
00:11:53,822 --> 00:11:55,302
If you're trying not
to draw attention,

359
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:57,043
why not go with something
like "John Smith?"

360
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:58,131
- From "Pocahontas"?

361
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,090
Uh, yeah.
Way to fly under the radar.

362
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,003
[laughs]

363
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:02,831
- Excuse me, is there ice yet?

364
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,137
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't work here.

365
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,747
I'm a police officer.

366
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,445
- Well, then I'd like
to lodge a formal complaint.

367
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:08,968
There hasn't been ice here
for days

368
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,883
and everyone knows
my wine coolers are supposed

369
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,450
to be served chilled.
- You're an adult.

370
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:13,799
Why are you
drinking wine coolers?

371
00:12:13,842 --> 00:12:15,453
- Because I'm on vacation.
- Okay.

372
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:17,411
Well, I'll mention the ice.

373
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:18,978
- Thanks.
Pig.

374
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,458
- Okay.

375
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,373
[phone ringing]

376
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,765
- Oh, it's Holt.

377
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,766
I didn't tell him
what we were doing.

378
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,159
- I'll act natural.

379
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,508
- You're not gonna be
on the phone call.

380
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:28,727
Just do nothing.
Hey, Captain!

381
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,294
- What delicious water
I'm drinking!

382
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:32,078
- [growls] Sorry that we didn't
check in before we left.

383
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:33,645
We're just down
at the DMV following up

384
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:35,212
on the Saturn owners.
- Lies!

385
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,214
- Captain!
How'd you know we were here?

386
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,563
- I followed you!

387
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,217
John Kelly gave you
a "Hot Clue," didn't he?

388
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,609
How dare you disobey me.

389
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,002
- Come on, sir,
it was a good tip

390
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,351
and we're trying
to catch a serial killer.

391
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:45,700
- Well then let's see
this tip,

392
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,876
this groundbreaking tip

393
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,400
that threatens
to blow the case wide open.

394
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:51,706
- Okay, I know this tone.
Here comes petty Holt.

395
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,881
- Naw, bitch.
I'm not being petty.

396
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:54,231
- You just said, "naw, bitch."

397
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,189
- Show me the tip.
- [exasperated sigh]

398
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,886
[whispers]
Title of your sex tape.

399
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,410
- I was behind
the Royal Motor Inn.

400
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:02,282
I saw a guy get out
of a blue Saturn Ion

401
00:13:02,326 --> 00:13:03,631
and he was covered in blood.

402
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:05,067
Anyway, Baba Booey!

403
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,026
- Baba Booey?
Is that a clue?

404
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,202
- Uh, I don't know what
Baba Booey means, actually.

405
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,552
- It's a popular prank phrase
from Howard Stern.

406
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:13,859
- Charles!
- Oh, from a shock jock.

407
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:15,208
Well, that changes everything.

408
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,168
Now we have
a credible break in the case.

409
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:19,517
Baba Booey!

410
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,214
[hard knocking]
NYPD, open up!

411
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,563
- Uh, just a minute!

412
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,870
- Ooh, I bet
he's frantically packing up

413
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:26,263
his collection of hearts.

414
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,786
[glass breaking]

415
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:29,744
- Goin' in!
Get back.

416
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:33,183
- There's blood everywhere!
- He went out the window.

417
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:35,315
- I'll go around back.

418
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,665
- Fine, Kelly found the
murderer's kill room.

419
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,711
Whoop-dee-doo!
Should we throw him a parade?

420
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:41,713
- Yeah!
Maybe!

421
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,283
- Patrols have searched
a five-block radius.

422
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,893
No sign of the perp.

423
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:49,416
- And there were no prints.
He was wearing gloves.

424
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,809
- Like the inimitable
Audrey Hepburn.

425
00:13:50,852 --> 00:13:52,419
- Nope.
- Gentlemen, there's something

426
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,160
I need to say.
I gave you such a hard time

427
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:57,163
about using Commissioner Kelly's
app because I was being petty.

428
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,383
I wanted him to fail
and I took it out on you

429
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:03,387
and for that I am very...

430
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,693
- Oh. You kind of trailed off
there, sir.

431
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:07,434
Were you going
to finish your sentence?

432
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:08,827
It felt like you were going
to say you were sorry.

433
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,350
- I did.
Boyle heard it.

434
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:12,178
- Uh, I would remember if
someone said my catch phrase.

435
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,267
- Fine, I'm sorry.

436
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,269
I'm very sorry.

437
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,271
- Apology accepted.

438
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,447
I am so proud of you.
- Peralta.

439
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:21,753
- You're right.
I'll rub it in later.

440
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:23,276
What matters now
is solving this case.

441
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,756
Now, our murderer
may have gotten away,

442
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,671
but we did find
his kill room.

443
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,499
Maybe there's something in here
that we're not seeing, yet.

444
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:30,414
- Perhaps we should pay your
cannibal friend another visit.

445
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:33,199
- I wouldn't say they're friends
so much as ex-cellmates.

446
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:34,853
- No, it's true.
We're friends.

447
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:37,986
- He ate kids!
- Well, people are complicated.

448
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,205
- Now, I'll tell you one thing.

449
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:40,641
You are not looking
for a cannibal.

450
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,426
- Why do you say that?
- With all that blood?

451
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:45,298
- No self-respecting cannibal
would waste all that sauce.

452
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,778
- See, Charles?
He's a foodie, like you.

453
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:49,215
- Who are you?
- Can I see that picture again?

454
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,261
Oh man, those are
some nice tools.

455
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:52,914
I would love
to spread some ribs

456
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,307
using that sternum retractor,

457
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,613
but they only sell those
to hospitals.

458
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:57,528
- Wait a minute.
What did you just say?

459
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:59,617
- I said I'd love
to get my little fingies

460
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,835
in some chesties.

461
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,315
- No, no, no.
Not the super gross part.

462
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,534
Surgery-grade tools,

463
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:04,709
precise incisions
around the heart,

464
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:06,406
and there was no ice
at the motel.

465
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,321
- Because the perp was using
it for the hearts.

466
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,323
- We're not looking
for a serial killer.

467
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,238
He stole the hearts
for a transplant!

468
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:13,631
- Boom!
We solved it.

469
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:15,981
Boyle, give me a hug.
- Yeah!

470
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:18,375
[all screaming]
- No!

471
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:20,551
- Hey, I did it!

472
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:22,553
I talked to Brian and encouraged
him to pursue his dreams.

473
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:24,076
- Really?
Is he gonna quit?

474
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,643
- I don't know,
that was the first step.

475
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:27,514
But I figure
if I talk to him twice a day

476
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,516
for the next few weeks—
- Attention, everyone!

477
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,649
Today will be my final day
at the Nine-Nine.

478
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:33,346
- Damn, Loot.
That was fast.

479
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,826
- I will be taking my talents
to Broadway

480
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:36,828
and I owe it all
to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords.

481
00:15:36,871 --> 00:15:38,482
- All I did was
believe in you.

482
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:39,787
- And it changed everything.

483
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:42,224
So Lieutenant,
this one's for you.

484
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:43,661
- Oh.

- Bye, Jake!
- Here it is.

00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:04,812
The federal heart transplant
waiting list.

495
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:07,424
Check out who's all the way
down at 2,319.

496
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,601
Angelo Rinaldi, who runs
the Rinaldi crime family.

497
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:13,255
- Well.
Then let's pay him a visit.

498
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:14,605
[bangs]

499
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:17,042
- NYPD!
- Hands where we can see them!

500
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:18,652
- There's a heart
in the cooler.

501
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:21,263
- Sorry, Rinaldi, the only
transplant happening today

502
00:16:21,307 --> 00:16:22,787
is your ass to jail.

503
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,441
He is definitely unconscious
and didn't hear any of that.

504
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,530
But I'm still pumped.
Case closed. Let's go!

505
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:28,967
- So Rinaldi had his
trigger-man stealing hearts

506
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,186
so he could have a transplant.

507
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,319
That is fun!
Good job, Ray.

508
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:34,625
- Thank you,
Commissioner Kelly.

509
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:36,627
We couldn't have done it
