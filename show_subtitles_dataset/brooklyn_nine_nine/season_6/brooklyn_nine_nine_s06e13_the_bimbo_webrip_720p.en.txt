1
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:07,660
- I'm here!
I'm here, I'm here.

2
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:08,661
You can start the meeting now.

3
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:09,879
- The meeting is over.
You're late.

4
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:12,186
You missed roll call
and the tutorial

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,492
on using the new copiers.

6
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:15,494
Six years, and no matter
how hard I try, I still can't

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,452
get you to understand the
importance of being punctual.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:19,150
- Maybe you should just give up
and accept me for who I am?

9
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:20,325
- No, I will break you.

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:21,587
Right now.
- Oh.

11
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:23,154
- While you were out
being tardy,

12
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:25,330
I was hard at work
devising a special punishment.

13
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:28,289
I've crafted an intricate
personal high five

14
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,899
with everyone in this office
except you.

15
00:00:29,943 --> 00:00:31,336
- What?
But you hate high fives.

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,686
- Yes, every minute of it
was hell.

17
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,645
But it'll be worse for you.
Squad, dismissed.

18
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,256
Good-bye, Diaz.

19
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:40,649
- Salute into a fanny waggle?

20
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:43,435
- Good-bye, Boyle.
- Oh, the snake charmer!

21
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:44,697
- Good-bye, Jeffords.

22
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:47,874
- That's a butt bump.
- Good-bye, Santiago.

23
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,832
- Double fist bump
reverse explosion

24
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:51,704
into a Pete Townshend strum.

25
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:54,272
All right, that was terrible,

26
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:55,838
but it's over now,
and I made it through.

27
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:56,926
- Good-bye, Leonard from Xerox.

28
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,451
- What?
No, no, no.

29
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:00,582
The copy guy?

30
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,995
- So nice of you to stop by,
Kevin.

31
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:23,518
Enjoy your day.
I hope it's productive.

32
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:24,563
- Thank you, Raymond.

33
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:26,913
I hope your day
is productive as well.

34
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:28,784
PDA in the office?
My, my.

35
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:30,264
- Couldn't help myself.
- Hmm.

36
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:32,048
Oh, may I please use
the precinct facilities

37
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,398
before I head to work?

38
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:34,399
- Yes. Thank you for asking
for permission.

39
00:01:35,226 --> 00:01:36,009
- Thank you for granting it.

40
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,537
Whoomp.
- There it is!

41
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:43,538
Got to say, I could have used

42
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:44,757
a little more oomph
on the whoomp.

43
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:46,019
- That's the oomphiest whoomp
you'll get.

44
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:47,542
- So what's going on? Why'd you
want to meet in private?

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:48,587
- I need your help with a case.

46
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:49,675
Three antique coins were stolen

47
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,024
from my classics department
at Columbia.

48
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:52,939
- So why not ask Captain Holt
for help on the case?

49
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:54,810
Wait, are you guys getting
a divorce?

50
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:55,942
I can handle it.

51
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:57,770
This doesn't bring up
any weird issues for me.

52
00:01:58,684 --> 00:01:58,858
- No, it's nothing like that.

53
00:01:59,902 --> 00:01:59,989
Raymond's a brilliant
detective.

54
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:01,469
It's just when a case
involves me,

55
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:03,471
he can get a little
overemotional.

56
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,344
You remember the safe house.
- Oh, yeah, he went crazy.

57
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:07,997
But I also remember you and me
becoming best friends

58
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,085
and watching every Nic Cage
movie ever made.

59
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,348
Can you still quote them all?

60
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:11,349
- No, I purged myself
of that nonsense.

61
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:12,654
- Oh, I bet it's still in there.
- It's not.

62
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:13,655
- We'll see.
- We won't.

63
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:14,656
- There's a chance
it's in there.

64
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:15,701
- Chance of zero.

65
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:16,876
- I'd put money
that maybe it's there.

66
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:18,051
- You're losing your money.
- Okay.

67
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:19,792
- So will you help me?
- I don't know.

68
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:21,315
I want to, but keeping a secret
from Holt?

69
00:02:22,316 --> 00:02:22,360
That's a lot of pressure.
- Hmm.

70
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:23,448
Am I remembering correctly?

71
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:26,015
Don't you...
eat pressure for breakfast?

72
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:28,888
Nic Cage in "The Rock."

73
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:31,020
We are best friends.
I am so in!

74
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:32,674
- Oh, no, that's Raymond.

75
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:33,675
That's how he opens a door.

76
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,763
- Kevin, are you still in here?

77
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:36,635
- Uh, yes, Raymond,
I'm in the stall.

78
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,027
- Some tickets
were just released

79
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,378
for Mahler's Fourth Symphony
this weekend.

80
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:41,814
- Great. That sounds great.
Let's do it.

81
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,033
- Fantastic. Now, which section
do you prefer?

82
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,731
The first tier,

83
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,994
the second tier,
the third tierâ€”

84
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,082
- The first tier.

85
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:51,476
- Now, which section
of the first tier?

86
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,044
Right, left, right center,
center...

87
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,785
- Just any section is fine.

88
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,134
- Any section, wow.

89
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,788
Someone had pepper
on their eggs this morning.

90
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:01,790
I'll buy the tickets.

91
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:04,576
Any section.

92
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,838
- Guys, horrible news.

93
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,840
The fridge broke this morning.
Everything's warm.

94
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,102
- Doesn't seem like
that big a deal.

95
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:10,930
- Your yogurt's spoiled.
- Who did this?

96
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,758
- Okay, everyone calm down.

97
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:14,673
I will put a request in
for a new fridge.

98
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:15,848
- Good luck
getting that approved.

99
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,153
Commissioner Kelly's already
slashed our budget

100
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,024
within an inch of its life.

101
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,113
- Yeah, the toilet paper's
only one ply now.

102
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:21,810
- My butt hurts all the time.
- The AC is broken.

103
00:03:22,681 --> 00:03:22,855
- My butt hurts all the time.

104
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:24,422
- Scully's butt hurts
all the time.

105
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:25,684
- All right, guys, we get it.

106
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:27,599
- It's just that lunch
is the one part of the day

107
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:28,861
Commissioner Kelly
hadn't ruined.

108
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,037
People are pissed.
Morale's really taken a hit.

109
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,126
- Okay, I got this.

110
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:34,954
Hey, squad.
Lunch is on me today.

111
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:36,608
Taking everyone out for pizza.

112
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:39,741
And that's how you improve
morale.

113
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:42,091
- Okay. You're not the only
sergeant around here.

114
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,528
Let me help.

115
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,834
This side of the room,
lunch is on me,

116
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:48,402
and we're getting something
better than pizza.

117
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:49,534
Sushi!

118
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,624
- Are you trying to outdo me?

119
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,495
- No, no, no.

120
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,019
Just trying to raise morale.

121
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:58,543
- Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

122
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,459
Morale, morale, morale.
Okay.

123
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:03,722
- Wow, so this is
your classroom.

124
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:04,940
What's today's lecture about?

125
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:06,638
- I know you don't care
about that.

126
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:07,769
Just ask me what you want
to ask me.

127
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,118
- Can I play
with your laser pointer?

128
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:11,817
- You know, the laser pointer
is a bit of a misnomer.

129
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,168
It is simply a laser.
The pointer is you.

130
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,691
- That was awesome.
- Take it for a spin.

131
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:18,998
- Don't mind if I do.
Good afternoon, class.

132
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,870
Allow me to make my first...
point.

133
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:24,046
- Very impressive.
- Thank you very much, Kevin.

134
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,048
But I do have five additional
points to make.

135
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,964
Chair, chair, wall, chair,

136
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:29,965
Captain Holt.

137
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,532
Captain Holt? No.

138
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:34,927
- Yes, that was
a delicious lunch, Gary!

139
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,146
And I agree,
our group does seem happier

140
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,234
than it was before.

141
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,671
- Oh, the pizza was that good?

142
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,543
- Pizza? Right, that's what
I said we were getting

143
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:45,154
before we decided to
uh-snazz it up.

144
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:46,895
- Oh, you guys snazzed?

145
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:49,724
- Yeah, we snazzed all the way
to La Petite Creperie.

146
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:51,465
- I thought we couldn't say
"snazz."

147
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:53,859
Oh, no, I was thinking of

148
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:55,121
We can't say.
Carry on.

149
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:56,862
- Tell 'em how good it was,
Rosa.

150
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:59,081
Tell 'em how high
our morale is.

151
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,909
- High.
- Oh, stop gushing, girl.

152
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:02,084
- I think it's so interesting

153
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,565
you guys didn't stick
to your original plan,

154
00:05:04,609 --> 00:05:06,088
because neither did we.

155
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:07,481
- What? Why?

156
00:05:08,526 --> 00:05:09,614
- Oh, you don't think we knew
you were gonna snazz?

157
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,747
We saw your snazz
coming a mile away.

158
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,575
That's why I took my team out

159
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:17,099
for some big, juicy steaks,
and...

160
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:18,666
all: â™ª Mashed potatoes

161
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,800
â™ª And some spinach
and some key lime pie â™ª

162
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,018
- Thank you, Heather.
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:24,542
- Well, that doesn't sound
better than crepes.

164
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,195
- It is.
Terry wins.

165
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,719
We know.
We were at both lunches.

166
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,025
- How? They were simultaneous
and two miles apart.

167
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,853
- It was free food.
Life finds a way.

168
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:33,115
- Okay, but you can't win

169
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,552
because it wasn't
a competition.

170
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,596
- So let's make it
a competition.

171
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,815
Same groups tomorrow?

172
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:38,599
- Okay, but let's agree
at the end of this

173
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:40,209
that we'll still be friends.
- No deal.

174
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:41,994
- Good!
'Cause I didn't mean it anyway.

175
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:43,691
- Hello, sir.
How'd you find us out?

176
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:44,736
- Mahler's Fourth Symphony.

177
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:46,738
He'd never sit
in just any section.

178
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,130
- I might.
I'm flexible.

179
00:05:48,174 --> 00:05:51,046
- Oh, really?
You'd sit center left?

180
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,221
In timpani alley?

181
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:54,049
I'll purchase those tickets
right away.

182
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:01,274
- No, don't!
Fine.

183
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:02,623
Jake is helping me
with a burglary

184
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:03,624
here at the university,

185
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:05,713
and I asked him
not to tell you.

186
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:07,889
- Is this about St. Augustine?
- Yes.

187
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,195
- What's going on?
- He's embarrassed of me.

188
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:10,588
Last Christmas,

189
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:12,067
the classics department
threw a holiday party.

190
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,158
I had one drink too many
and utterly humiliated myself.

191
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:17,986
And that was the point
St. Augustine was making

192
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,248
in "Consolation of Philosophy."

193
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,946
- Yeah, sounds
super humiliating,

194
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,251
saying something smart.

195
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:24,819
- Smart? I confused
St. Augustine with Boethius.

196
00:06:24,863 --> 00:06:26,168
I might as well
have stepped on a rake

197
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:27,692
and bonked myself
on the forehead.

198
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,084
- The problem
wasn't what you said.

199
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:30,564
It was that Dean Allister
pointed out your mistake,

200
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:31,957
and you lost your damned mind.

201
00:06:33,524 --> 00:06:34,873
- I misremembered it because
I'm reading both simultaneously.

202
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,701
One book is too few for me.

203
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:37,702
Where is everyone going?

204
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,705
- It was quite the kerfuffle.

205
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:43,055
- The problem is, is that I get
flustered and defensive

206
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:45,666
because I know
how they all see me:

207
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,930
as Kevin's working-class bimbo.

208
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,192
- I can't imagine
that's what they think.

209
00:06:50,236 --> 00:06:51,324
- It is.
- Really?

210
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:52,717
- Obviously I know
that they're wrong,

211
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:54,066
but they put you
in your own head,

212
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:55,284
and you're not yourself
around them.

213
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,286
I'm sorry, I was just
trying to protect you.

214
00:06:58,723 --> 00:06:59,680
- Yes, of course, thank you
for saving me from myself.

215
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:01,073
Now, if you'll excuse me,

216
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,945
I'll just go sit by the pool
and read some fiction...

217
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,731
like the bimbo that I am.

218
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:09,951
- There's a pool here?

219
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:14,260
- Sir, wait.

220
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:16,392
Oh! Wasn't expecting
to catch up to you so fast.

221
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:18,133
I don't know what to say now.
I thought I was gonna have

222
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,483
more running time
to formulate it. Oh, I know!

223
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:21,876
I'm sorry that we kept the case
a secret from you.

224
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:23,225
- Oh, I understand why you did.

225
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,184
The truth is,
ever since I met Kevin,

226
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:26,664
I've felt insecure
in his world.

227
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:29,841
I can't compete with these
highly educated academics.

228
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,407
I worry every day

229
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,367
that I'll make one
St. Augustine slip too many,

230
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,239
and he'll realize...

231
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:38,632
I'm beneath him.
- This is insane.

232
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:40,155
You're the smartest person
I know.

233
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,636
- I'll explain it to you.
Among Kevin's peers,

234
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,290
I'm a Jake.
- No, no, no, no, no.

235
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,770
I refuse to live in a world
where you're the Jake,

236
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,815
because if you're the Jake,
what does that make me?

237
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,251
The Charles?
- The Hitchcock.

238
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:51,645
- The Hitchcock?
Oh, my God.

239
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:53,865
You dropped down so many more
levels than I was expecting.

240
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,780
Okay, you know what?
Screw this.

241
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:56,868
You are so smart,

242
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:58,521
and we're gonna prove it
to those professors.

243
00:07:59,348 --> 00:07:59,610
You're gonna work this case,

244
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:01,873
and you're gonna find
those coins.

245
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,310
- Well, I suppose
it would be nice to show them

246
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,660
I'm more than just a hot,
dumb piece of ass.

247
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:08,183
- Yes! That's the spirit.

248
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:09,576
Now get that hot ass moving,

249
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,795
'cause we've got a crime
to solve.

250
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,448
- Peralta, please,
have some decorum.

251
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,885
- What?
I was just using your words.

252
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,669
Look, you teach people
the way you want to be treated.

253
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:17,323
That's what Dr. Phil says.

254
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:20,195
- Okay, lunchtime starts
in ten minutes.

255
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:21,893
Whichever team wins
gets recorded

256
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,503
on the Whiteboard of Victory.

257
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,896
- The winner will be decided
by our judges,

258
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,288
Hitchcock and Scully.

259
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:28,203
- Oh, my God, are we
high status, Hitchcock?

260
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:29,770
- I think so.
- What a world.

261
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:30,902
- Ah, well, good luck.

262
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:32,817
I'm sure you know
all the best places to eat

263
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:34,862
since you've reached
Elite status on Yelp.

264
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:36,211
Oh, wait, that was me.

265
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:37,299
- Oh, because Yelp reviewers

266
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:38,823
are sane people
with great taste?

267
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,347
- Oh, sorry, couldn't hear you
over GourmetGlen12 saying

268
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,349
that my review of the duck skin
at the Hearth and Feather

269
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,742
was helpful.

270
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,832
- Come on, Team Jeffords.
It's chow time.

271
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,922
- We have a cool thing
to say too.

272
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,794
Team Santiago,
let's lunch-a-bunch!

273
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:56,231
- No, I don't say that.
- Come on, Rosa, please?

274
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,276
Let's lunch-a-bunch.

275
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,494
- Aha, Rosa said it!

276
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,974
Did you hear that?
Did you hear it?

277
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:03,586
- Ah, Dean Allister?
- Policeman Raymond.

278
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,632
Good to see you.

279
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:07,721
Read any interesting magazines
lately?

280
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:09,244
- This again?
I was waiting for Kevin,

281
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:11,464
I had finished my book,
and I happened to glance

282
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:14,336
at an issue of "The Economist"
that someone left lying about.

283
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,382
- All I remember
is you becoming unhinged.

284
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,340
- The only reason I
picked it up was to swat a fly.

285
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:19,559
I mean, I'm not crazy.

286
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,692
Why are there always flowers
here?

287
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:24,564
- So is policeman Raymond
joining the case?

288
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,044
- Actually, he's leading it.

289
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:27,872
Captain Holt
is the finest investigator

290
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:28,873
I've ever worked with.

291
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:30,918
Sir, tell him our plan
of action.

292
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:38,883
- Clues.
- Okay, you're freezing up.

293
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:40,406
I'm just gonna take the wheel
for now.

294
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:41,755
There were no signs
of forced entry,

295
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:43,539
the only people with access
to the archives

296
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,802
were the professors
in the department,

297
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:47,935
and they all have alibis,
which means...

298
00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:49,502
- I don't know
what you want me to say.

299
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,286
- Okay, that's my fault
for throwing it to you again.

300
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:52,853
Which means we need to examine
the crime scene.

301
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:54,420
It is there that we will find

302
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,425
what Captain Holt has
so eloquently described as...

303
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:00,426
- Clues?

304
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,775
Sir, you just said it.

305
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,908
- Cupcakes up, everyone.

306
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:05,823
Heather, you already ate yours?

307
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,563
The point is to eat it
in their faces.

308
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,568
- Honk, honk, bitches.
- What the hell?

309
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,656
- We rented a party limo,

310
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,875
drove to Coney Island
for hot dogs,

311
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:16,616
and then did karaoke
the entire time.

312
00:10:17,922 --> 00:10:18,574
I sang "It Wasn't Me"
by Shaggy. Crushed it.

313
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:19,967
- But that's not even
about lunch!

314
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:21,621
It'sâ€”
- An experience.

315
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:22,970
- Team Amy wins.
- What?

316
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,929
How did you get there?
You were just with us.

317
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,974
Scully was with them.
- Free food.

318
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:29,020
- Great cupcake, Sarge.

319
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,805
But Amy still wins.
- Eat snazz, losers!

320
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:35,809
- Okay, so there were
no witnesses,

321
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:36,984
no cameras, and no prints.

322
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,681
- In other words,
we have nothing.

323
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:40,640
That's what you get when you
put a bimbo on the case.

324
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,816
- Okay, well, let's not give up
all hope just yet.

325
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,948
We do know some things.

326
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:45,819
For example,
the perp entered using a key,

327
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:47,342
which means they probably
work here.

328
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,822
And they knew enough
to skip past

329
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,781
all these expensive-looking
artifacts.

330
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:52,434
They walked straight up
to this shelf

331
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:53,871
and grabbed the coin case
from up there.

332
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,002
- It's too high.
You can't reach it.

333
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:56,699
- Exactly.
So now we know that the thief

334
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:58,397
was taller than me.
That's a good lead.

335
00:10:59,702 --> 00:10:59,920
Also, we know they were
a little bit of a freak,

336
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,054
since I am above average height
according to the 1940 census.

337
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,533
- I didn't realize you had
a thing about your height.

338
00:11:04,577 --> 00:11:06,797
- I don't!
Because I'm above average.

339
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,972
Why would I have a thing
about my height

340
00:11:09,321 --> 00:11:09,538
when I'm above average?
It doesn't make any sense.

341
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:12,933
Anyways, we're looking
for an insanely tall perp,

342
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:14,369
a real Shaq type.

343
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,807
- Maybe the thief stood
on something, like...

344
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,984
one of these drawers.

345
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,855
Turn off the light.

346
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,901
Maybe something will show up
under UV.

347
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:27,730
Bingpot!
- A footprint.

348
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,558
You did it,
you brilliant bimbo.

349
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:31,778
- Oh, there you are.
Why are you in the dark?

350
00:11:31,822 --> 00:11:33,040
Were you not able to find
the light switch?

351
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,000
- Ha-ha, very funny,
but I'll actually have you know

352
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:37,828
Captain Holt just found
a very promising lead.

353
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,177
- Oh, how fun, a lead.

354
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,700
Meanwhile,
we actually found the thief.

355
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:41,919
- You did?
- What?

356
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:43,529
- Well, technically
our janitor found him.

357
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:44,573
Come on in, Randy.

358
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:45,792
Tell them how you did
their jobs.

359
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,881
- Well, um,
I was emptying the trash

360
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:49,578
in Professor Port's office.

361
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:52,712
I saw something shiny sticking
out from underneath a notepad.

362
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:54,409
It was one
of the missing coins.

363
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:55,976
- Great police work.

364
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,065
Perhaps you might want
to hire Randy, or...

365
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,459
Randy, you could hire them.

366
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,940
It seems like you all have
basically the same skill set.

367
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,030
- We're actually all staffed up
in maintenance.

368
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:07,814
- We don't want your job,
Randy.

369
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:12,384
- I know Dean Allister
humiliated us,

370
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:13,733
but we can still have
our revenge.

371
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:15,735
I watched a ton of horny '80s
comedies when I was a kid,

372
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:18,433
and they're filled with ways
of getting back at mean deans.

373
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:20,958
So we are gonna throw
the wildest party

374
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,003
this campus has ever seen.
- No.

375
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:24,439
- Okay, then we'll have
a bikini car wash.

376
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:26,006
- No, no, save your schemes.

377
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,139
I know exactly how to get back
at the dean.

378
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,054
By arresting him.
- For what?

379
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,446
It seems pretty obvious
that Port did it.

380
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,621
- No, no, that makes no sense.

381
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:33,535
Why would someone
steal something valuable

382
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,015
and then leave it
in their desk?

383
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,321
- I feel like this is
a veiled shot at me

384
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:37,322
for leaving the crown
in my desk

385
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:38,323
during the third
Halloween Heist.

386
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:39,324
- It is.
- Oh.

387
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,152
- Allister planted the coin

388
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:42,370
in Professor Port's desk.

389
00:12:42,414 --> 00:12:43,763
They're rivals.
- Mm.

390
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,548
- Did you see the book Allister
was holding back there?

391
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,464
A biography of Macedonian
general Parmenion.

392
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:50,596
He was taunting us.

393
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,684
- Again,
I'm the Hitchcock here.

394
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:53,381
You're gonna have to
connect the dots for me.

395
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,080
- Parmenion was a close advisor
to Alexander the Great.

396
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:58,125
Alexander suspected
that Parmenion

397
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:00,519
was trying to supplant him,
so he executed him.

398
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,260
- He was getting rid
of his rival.

399
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:04,784
Sir, you cracked it!
You and your big hard brain.

400
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,090
- Hard?
- Yes!

401
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:07,482
You have the biggest, hardest
brain on Earth,

402
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:08,744
and I want you to say it.

403
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:11,312
Say "I am Raymond Holt,
and my brain is rock hard."

404
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:12,444
- A brain shouldn't be hard.

405
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:14,185
If anything, I'll say,
"I am Raymond Holt,

406
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:15,621
and my brain is soft and wet."

407
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:17,536
- No, don't say that.
It's gross and I hate it.

408
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:19,190
All right, let's go do
some cop stuff.

409
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,845
- Wait, why does Terry's team
have four wins?

410
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,674
He only won steaks, bowling,
and the mobile escape room.

411
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:27,415
- You're forgetting
about our breakfast

412
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:28,677
at the Empire State Building.

413
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:30,244
- It was so cold up there.

414
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:32,725
- It sounds a lot better than
our indoor skydiving lunch.

415
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,075
Speaking of which, are we gonna
get reimbursed for that?

416
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:37,730
- How dare you complain
about the Funtastic FlyZone.

417
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,645
That was funtastic fun
for everyone.

418
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,299
- So what are you guys planning
for today?

419
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:42,604
- Oh, nothing much.

420
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:43,736
We're just gonna keep it
"caszh."

421
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,781
- Us too. Super "caszh."

422
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,219
Super duper "caszh."

423
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:50,134
- We all know
you're both planning

424
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:52,614
something insanely complicated
and annoying.

425
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:55,356
- Your teammates
are turning against you, Terry.

426
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,141
- I'm on your team.
- Who cares?

427
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,404
We're gonna win.
Team Lunch-a-Bunch forever.

428
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,407
- Sir, why are we still
doing this?

429
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,712
We've been following him
for days,

430
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:05,279
and he hasn't done
anything suspicious.

431
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:06,585
Let's just confront him.

432
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,370
- He only hid one of the stolen
coins in Port's desk.

433
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,371
He'll probably try to sell
the others.

434
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:11,416
I want to catch him in the act.

435
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:12,591
- Shh. Here he comes.

436
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:19,728
These college kids.

437
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:20,860
I used to wear
long-sleeve T-shirts

438
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,427
under my short-sleeve T-shirts.

439
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,515
Wait a minute, I still could.

440
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:24,559
- Hang on.
He's stopping.

441
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:25,604
- Oh, no, he forgot his phone.

442
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:26,431
He's gonna turn around
and see us.

443
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:27,867
Come on.

444
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:30,261
Sorry, sorry.
- Oh, hey, guys, what's up?

445
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:31,566
You want to join
our a cappella jam circle?

446
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,567
- Oh, no.

447
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:33,655
- Are you guys
Harry Potter fans?

448
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:34,787
- I do not like
where this is going.

449
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:35,744
- Three, four.

450
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,618
- â™ª Won't you
come visit Hogwarts? â™ª

451
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:43,839
â™ª I'll be alone,
dancing in Gryffindor â™ª

452
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,366
â™ª Harry is the best
at the spells â™ª

453
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,586
â™ª And as for potions,
Hermione does well â™ª

454
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,761
- This is actually
pretty funny.

455
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:55,242
You got to know Harry Potter.

456
00:14:55,286 --> 00:14:58,202
Wait a minute.
Where'd Allister go?

457
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,420
He was standing right here.

458
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,205
It's like he vanished
without a trace.

459
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,555
- Wrong, Peralta.
He vanished with a trace.

460
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:05,774
Check it out. His footprint.
Gotcha.

461
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:07,385
- I am Raymond Holt
and my brain is rock hard.

462
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:08,473
- I'm not going to say that.
- Smart.

463
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:09,691
Saving it for a bigger moment

464
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:10,866
in front of a bunch of people.
Can't wait!

465
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:13,565
- Okay, squad,
hope you ate lunch already,

466
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:15,828
because it's lunchtime!

467
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,873
- What's with the getups?
- Oh, nothing much.

468
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,179
We just turned
the parking garage

469
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,746
into an elaborate
paintball arena.

470
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,357
It's zombie-themed.
We hired 60 actors.

471
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:24,619
- That sounds pretty expensive.

472
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:26,273
- Nah, New York actors
are desperate.

473
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:27,796
For ten bucks, you can
shoot 'em right in the face.

474
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,711
- Wow, that's amazing.

475
00:15:29,755 --> 00:15:32,584
I don't know how anybody
could ever beat that...

476
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:35,935
except maybe an in-office
teppanyaki grill.

477
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,154
- Moshi moshi, losers!

478
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:39,504
- We got shrimp.
We got lobster.

479
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,375
Heather, I know you're allergic
to shellfish.

480
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,290
You're just gonna have to
not eat.

481
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:46,250
Where's Heather?
Where is everybody?

482
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,513
They're on the roof
by Gina's statue.

483
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:50,645
- What the hell, guys?
- Oh, God, they found us.

484
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,647
- Don't let them take me.
- Why are you hiding from us?

485
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:54,997
- This lunch competition
has gotten out of hand.

486
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,390
No one is having fun.

487
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:57,739
I keep having panic dreams

488
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:00,525
about Sergeant Santiago
shooting down my lunch ideas.

489
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,918
- Historic walking tours
don't win lunch, Gary.

490
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,225
- No one cares about
winning lunch.

491
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:07,184
Please, just leave us alone.

492
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:09,925
Gary, wait. Lookâ€”

493
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,666
- Oh!
- Ow!

494
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,754
Why did you do that?

495
00:16:12,798 --> 00:16:14,321
- Oh, my God,
it was an accident.

496
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:15,670
This thing doesn't have
a safety.

497
00:16:15,714 --> 00:16:16,889
- Ow!

498
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:19,935
Ow, stop!
Help!

499
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,503
- And a big round of applause
for Janitor Randy

500
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:24,679
for recovering
our precious coin.

501
00:16:24,723 --> 00:16:26,768
- Don't applaud for that man.

502
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:27,769
- What's going on?

503
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:28,901
- What's going on is,

504
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,642
Captain Holt just solved
this case.

505
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,513
- What's there left to solve?
We found the coin

506
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,254
in Professor Port's desk.
He's the thief.

507
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:35,560
- Oh, you'd like everyone
to believe that,

508
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:36,691
wouldn't you, Dean Allister?

509
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:39,520
Or should I say,
General Parmenion?

510
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,305
- Raymond, are you causing
a kerfuffle?

511
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:43,524
- Yes. Sometimes a moment
calls for a kerfuffle.

512
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:45,352
- No. No moment
calls for a kerfuffle.

513
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:46,484
You know my feelings on this.

514
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:48,877
- Dean Allister
framed Professor Port

515
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:49,922
to get rid of a rival,

516
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,707
just as Alexander got rid
of Parmenion.

517
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,014
- Preposterous. Do you even
have a shred of evidence

518
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,058
to back up that claim?

519
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:57,321
- Oh, we've got more
than a shred.

520
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,539
Look at these photos.

521
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:00,933
Here, a footprint
from the scene of the crime

522
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,326
left by the thief.

523
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,677
And here, another print
made yesterday by you.

524
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,896
You've been caught, Allister!
- Is it happening?

525
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,376
- Caught by me.
- It is happening.

526
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,553
- Me and my rock hard brain.
- It happened!

527
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:14,642
- Oh, Raymond.
Look around.

528
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:17,993
These shoes I'm wearing
with their "unique footprint"--

529
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,430
we all have them.

530
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:21,388
They were the departmental gift
this Christmas.

531
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:22,737
They're actually very funny.

532
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:24,435
They have Achilles printed
on the heel.

533
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:26,611
- I don't know if I would
call that "very" funny.

534
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,047
- I'm surprised you didn't know
about them.

535
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:29,614
Kevin must have gotten a pair.

536
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:31,398
Oh, I remember what happened.

537
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:32,834
You had to leave
the Christmas party

538
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:34,053
before they were handed out.

539
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,882
Why was that again?
Oh, yes. The kerfuffle.

540
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:38,753
- But what about the
autobiography of Persimminons

541
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:39,798
you were taunting us with?

542
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:41,669
- I suppose I can see how
holding any book

543
00:17:42,627 --> 00:17:42,975
would seem like a taunt to you.

544
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:44,324
- I own a book.
- But I don't think Raymond

545
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:45,847
is remembering
the story correctly.

546
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,285
Alexander didn't see Parmenion
as a rival.

547
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,374
He killed him over a dispute
about his son.

548
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,593
- Oh, no, it's Boethius
all over again.

549
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,334
- At least you got one thing
right.

550
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:57,424
You do have a rock hard brain.
Because that's bad.

551
00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:59,818
Everyone knows that a brain
should be soft and wet.

552
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:01,776
- I wanted to say that,
but Jake told me not to.

553
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,649
- Yeah, because it's gross.

554
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,654
- There you are.

555
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:11,699
You okay, sir?
- I'm fine.

556
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:12,961
I have decided
to stop fighting it

557
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:14,920
and lean in to the fact
that I'm an idiot.

558
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,269
Look at me,
playing a video game.

559
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:17,792
- Oh, which one?
- "Times" crossword app.

560
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:18,967
- Not a video game.

561
00:18:19,838 --> 00:18:20,969
- It plays a little song
when you solve it,

562
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:22,275
as if you've just learned
to potty.

563
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,192
Yes, yes, play me
my dunce's tune.

564
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:29,804
- Okay, so those guys look down
on you. So what?

565
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:31,284
I mean, Amy's parents
look down on me.

566
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:33,199
They talk about me right in
front of my face in Spanish

567
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:34,374
because they don't think
I'm smart enough

568
00:18:34,418 --> 00:18:35,723
to learn another language,

569
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,421
but I've been taking classes,

570
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:38,987
and now I can understand

571
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,815
all the hurtful things
they've been saying.

572
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,077
- And how did that help?

573
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,470
- Well, now I know
they think I'm short

574
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:44,950
and I was able
to do some research

575
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,299
and find that 1940s census

576
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:47,822
that proves I'm above average
in height.

577
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,171
- For 1940.
- Yeah, I'm taller

578
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,825
than the greatest generation.
It doesn't matter.

579
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,219
The point is, you can use this.

580
00:18:53,263 --> 00:18:56,396
There are benefits
to being underestimated.

581
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,181
- My goodness.
You're right.

582
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:02,184
There are benefits
to being underestimated.

583
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,925
You can get away with anything.

584
00:19:03,969 --> 00:19:06,928
- Sir?
Are you going to kill the dean?

585
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:09,801
- No. What if the thief
was someone we dismissed

586
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,324
because they didn't have
a classics background?

587
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,239
Someone who wasn't a professor?

588
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:14,371
- But what about
the footprints?

589
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:15,981
The shoes were only given
to faculty.

590
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,331
- There was one pair that was
unaccounted for: Kevin's.

591
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,072
They were left at the party...

592
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,508
to be cleaned up.

593
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:23,118
- By Janitor Randy!

594
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,338
My story solved it.
I'm tall.

595
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:28,298
- Hey, everyone, we would like
to say we're sorry

596
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:30,343
for letting this competition
get the best of us,

597
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:31,997
and to make it up to you,

598
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,215
we figured out what to do
for lunch.

599
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,434
- Please, whatever
your new idea is,

600
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:36,001
I just don't want
to get shot again.

601
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:38,177
- Ugh, Gary, it was
a paintball. Suck it up.

602
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,787
- Isn't this supposed to be
an apology?

603
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:42,747
- Yes. You're right.
I'm sorry.

604
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,923
I mean, I shot my husband with
a real bullet two years ago,

605
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:45,924
and it comes up way less
than this.

606
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:46,925
- Way less than this.

607
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,143
- Guys!
- Right.

608
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:50,972
What we're trying to say is
that we lost sight

609
00:19:51,016 --> 00:19:53,758
of what this was all
really about: building morale.

610
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,934
- So we bought two-ply toilet
paper for the whole squad.

611
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,370
- I call shotgun!
- Shotgun!

612
00:19:57,414 --> 00:20:00,199
- Also, I sold
the teppanyaki grill

613
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,376
and used the money to turn
the briefing room into...

614
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,030
the lunch zone.

615
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,466
- Oh, no.
What's the lunch zone?

616
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:09,251
Is it someplace we have to put
on a harness and not eat lunch?

617
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,558
- There are no harnesses.

618
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:15,083
There are phone chargers
and noise-canceling headphones.

619
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,477
- So you can eat your lunch
and stare at your phone

620
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,132
and you won't have to see
or hear anyone you work with.

621
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:22,917
- It's perfect.
It'sâ€”it's absolutely perfect.

622
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:24,136
- We're so glad you like it.

623
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:26,399
- And just to be sure,
I'm not gonna get shot.

624
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:30,142
- Oh, my God, Gary.
Yes! You won't get shot!

625
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,535
- Yeah, I stole those coins.

626
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,101
Can't believe you bought
that whole story.

627
00:20:33,145 --> 00:20:34,929
- They underestimated you,
Randy,

628
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:36,844
just as they underestimated
Raymond Holt.

629
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:38,368
- Well, you guys haven't been
that great to me either.

630
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:39,804
- Well, you got to teach people

631
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:41,545
how you want to be treated,
Randy. Dr. Phil, RIP.

632
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:43,155
The point is,
Captain Holt

633
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:44,809
solved the case
when no one else could.

634
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,159
- He's actually been stealing
from these archives for years.

635
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:48,552
You've been asleep
at the wheel, Allister.

636
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:49,988
You're an embarrassment.
- Really?

637
00:20:51,076 --> 00:20:51,381
Well, at least
I've never confused

638
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:52,947
St. Augustine with Boethius.

639
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,037
- Oh, who gives a rat's ass
about Boethius, Wesley?

640
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:57,212
- What are you doing, Kevin?

641
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:58,997
- I am creating a kerfuffle.
- Oh, damn.

642
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,521
- Sure, my husband is
a hot piece of ass,

643
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,305
but he is so much more
than just that.

644
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,960
Raymond Holt is as smart
as anyone in this department,

645
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:07,832
but he chooses
to use his intelligence

646
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,051
to make our city
a better place.

647
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:14,404
One day, I hope to live up to
the standard you set.

648
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:17,581
You make me want to have
a wetter brain.

649
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,191
- Oh, Kevin.

650
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,587
- Y'all are hella specific.

651
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,589
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

652
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,852
- Fremulon.
