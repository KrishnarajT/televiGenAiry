1
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:06,467
- All right, Jeffords,
what's this meeting all about?

2
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:07,816
I've got a full workload today.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,122
- I didn't call it.
I thought you did.

4
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:10,384
- What? I did no such thing.

5
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:11,385
- So if neither of you
called it,

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,691
then who did?

7
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:14,388
- Gina. Right.
- That makes sense.

8
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:15,694
- Oh!

9
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,961
Oh, Sheila,
that was awesome.

10
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:23,354
Okay, just stay here.

11
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:24,442
Wow, can't believe

12
00:00:24,485 --> 00:00:26,182
I executed that to perfection.

13
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,924
- That was amazing.
- Gina, what's this all about?

14
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,057
- I wanted to make one final
grand entrance.

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,406
- Final? What do you mean?

16
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,408
- I've decided
to leave the Nine-Nine.

17
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:35,583
Which is why...

18
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,848
- Oh, okay.

19
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,377
- I'm handing in my two weeks'
notice.

20
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,727
- I don't understand.
What are you gonna do?

21
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,032
- I'm not sure,
but Jake convinced me

22
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,904
it was time to start
a new chapter.

23
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:55,864
It was time to
spread my wings and fly.

24
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:58,389
I'm an angel.
I'm an angel.

25
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:00,434
I'm an angel.
- This is crazy.

26
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,131
I can't imagine
the Nine-Nine without you.

27
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:04,090
- Don't worry. I have
a parting gift for all of you.

28
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,701
I printed "Time for Gina's
Opinion" hoodies

29
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:08,355
for you
with your names on them.

30
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:10,401
Oh, there you go.
- Oh, that's fun.

31
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:11,750
So like
"Time for Jake's Opinion"?

32
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:13,012
- What are you, insane? No.

33
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:14,709
It says
"Time for Gina's Opinion"

34
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:16,407
in large text on the back

35
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,799
and then your names
are stitched

36
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:19,410
really tiny on the front.
- Ah.

37
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:21,324
- I had to guess
at some of the spellings.

38
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:22,891
- Arnie?
- But that's not all.

39
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:24,719
Over the next two weeks,
I will be leaving

40
00:01:24,763 --> 00:01:27,287
each of you with
a signature Gina Moment,

41
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,898
something so shocking
that it will stay with you

42
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:31,639
for the rest of your lives,

43
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,425
much like this interpretive
dance piece,

44
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,818
entitled, "The Linexit."

45
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:40,082
This dance will be performed
in four movements,

46
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:43,521
each one expressing one aspect
of my personality.

47
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,064
- Oh.

48
00:02:08,023 --> 00:02:09,764
Awesome.
Was that the first movement?

49
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:11,940
- What? Are you crazy?
No. That's the warm-up.

50
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:14,552
Each movement is 45 minutes.
- Oh, damn.

51
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:15,683
- Hit it!

52
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:40,316
- Hey, Craptain,
you ready to get curb stomped?

53
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,492
- What?
- At chess.

54
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:42,536
- We have a weekly match.

55
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,798
I'm teaching Gina to play.

56
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,147
And she, in turn,
is teaching me

57
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:47,541
to trash talk.
The hospital called.

58
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,282
Your test results came back
positive.

59
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:51,284
You're a stage five
dumbass.

60
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:52,764
- Oh!
You have come so far.

61
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:53,982
- You any good, Gina?
- The best.

62
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:55,201
- She struggles.
We've been playing

63
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:56,332
for four years now

64
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,769
and she has yet to defeat me.

65
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,379
- Well, good luck.
I'm rooting for you, Gina.

66
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:00,554
- You would take
the losers side,

67
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:02,687
Jeffords, you bitch.

68
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,992
Trash talk.
- Okay.

69
00:03:04,036 --> 00:03:05,341
I don't like this.
I'm gonna go.

70
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,648
- Really good, sir.
Really good.

71
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:10,259
- I don't know why
you're so confident you'll win.

72
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:13,349
You still don't even know
the names of all the pieces.

73
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,873
You dumbass.
- Nice.

74
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,745
But I do know the names.
I've simply rebranded them.

75
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:20,313
My queen is Rihanna.
My king is BeyoncÃ©.

76
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:22,924
And this little guy is Kevin.

77
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:25,927
Would you be willing to murder
Kevin, the love of your life?

78
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:27,842
- Yes. Chess Kevin means
nothing to me.

79
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:29,452
Gina, have you
thought this through?

80
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:30,671
Have you considered

81
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:32,151
the ramifications
of what you're doing?

82
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:34,370
- Yeah, I mean,
I named this guy Hitchcock

83
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,720
and now I kind of
want him off the board.

84
00:03:35,763 --> 00:03:37,199
- I was talking about
your decision

85
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:38,461
to leave the Nine-Nine.

86
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,072
Although I understand
your confusion.

87
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:42,291
There are many parallels
between the game of chess

88
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:44,076
and the game of life.
- Not really.

89
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:46,600
They're just a bunch of pieces
of wood on a placemat.

90
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,255
- In chess,
every move has consequences,

91
00:03:49,298 --> 00:03:52,127
some of which won't reveal
themselves until too late.

92
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:55,130
Even a small, seemingly
insignificant decision

93
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:57,393
can change the course
of the entire game.

94
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,831
- I feel like you're worried
I haven't considered

95
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:02,485
the consequences of quitting,
but I have.

96
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:04,487
- I know you feel you could be
doing more with your life,

97
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:06,968
but you're leaving the
Nine-Nine without a clear plan.

98
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,579
It's reckless.
- What you don't get,

99
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,886
but the greats do is that
in order to be successful,

100
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,193
sometimes you gotta
be reckless.

101
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,324
Boom.

102
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:16,891
- Checkmate.
- All right, all right.

103
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:18,240
I see you.
- It was a good game though

104
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:19,633
for a dumbass.
- Okay, you're kinda

105
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,895
overusing that one.

106
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,375
Maybe switch it up
a little bit.

107
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,029
- Oh, good note.
You dick.

108
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:27,423
- That landed good. All right,
re-rack. Let's play again.

109
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,600
Mkay, my move?

110
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:30,775
- Ah, whites go first.

111
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:32,211
- Oh, chess
really is like life.

112
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:33,081
Commentary.

113
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,909
The game you love is racist

114
00:04:34,953 --> 00:04:36,824
and you're complicit.
- So what's your plan?

115
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:39,000
Not with chess,
with your life moving forward.

116
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,872
- I mean, I could do basically
anything.

117
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:43,614
I could come up with a new form
of cryptocurrency

118
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:45,398
called GinaCoin,
make millions.

119
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,619
Could write a YA novel
about literally anything,

120
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:49,794
I think, and make millions.

121
00:04:49,837 --> 00:04:51,622
I could discover a new type

122
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,667
of melon, make millions.

123
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,277
- I'm not saying your dreams
are unattainable.

124
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:57,149
But you can pursue them
while you're still

125
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:58,672
gainfully employed
here at the Nine-Nine.

126
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,152
What's the rush
to turn your back

127
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:01,806
on stability and a paycheck?

128
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,503
I don't want stability
and a paycheck.

129
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:04,678
I wanna take a risk.

130
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,681
Quote: "A bird can never
learn to fly

131
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,640
if it doesn't leave
the nest."

132
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:11,772
End quote.
Gina Linetti, right now.

133
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,948
- Quote, "The bird
that leaves the nest too soon

134
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:16,429
plummets to its death
on the concrete below."

135
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:19,084
Captain Raymond Holt,
immediately afterwards.

136
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:20,781
- Nothing bad
ever happens to me.

137
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:22,740
I have a crystal in my pocket
at all times.

138
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,655
- What about when you got hit
by that bus?

139
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,657
- That bus was going
60 miles per hour

140
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,660
and here I sit before you
completely fine.

141
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,618
And you wanna say
crystals don't work?

142
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:33,098
- Gina, I'm serious.

143
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,709
What if you get sick?
Healthcare is expensive.

144
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,711
What if something happens
to your daughter?

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,149
- Checkmate.
- Did you just delay

146
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:42,673
that victory by a few moves

147
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:43,935
to punctuate your point?

148
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,850
- I did.
- Barf. Rack 'em.

149
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:48,156
- Okay, Captain,
you made some good points.

150
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,767
I mean,
I get what you're saying

151
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,117
about the healthcare
situation.

152
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,205
- Checkmate.

153
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:56,730
- I believe
that you're smart enough

154
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,733
and talented enough
to do anything you want.

155
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,996
but you have to have a plan.

156
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,824
- Mm.
Interesting.

157
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:05,347
Let me ask you something, sir.

158
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:08,002
Did you always have a plan
for everything you ever did?

159
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:09,700
You always thought out
every choice you ever made?

160
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:10,875
- Yes.
By the time I was ten,

161
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:12,267
I had mapped out
my entire life.

162
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:14,008
I knew I wanted
to go to the Academy.

163
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:15,444
I knew I wanted
to become a detective.

164
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:16,924
- And you did it.
- Then move on to sergeant.

165
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:18,360
- And you got it.
- Next, lieutenant.

166
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:20,362
- Nailed it.
- And then, finally, captain.

167
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:21,755
- Wow.
I'm convinced.

168
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,149
I think I should reconsider
my decision.

169
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:25,541
- Uh, we're not done
with the game.

170
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,021
- I know.
I just wanted to stand

171
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:29,894
so I could turn slowly
and say...

172
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:32,766
But wasn't there another step

173
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,246
in the Holt life plan?

174
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,204
Gosh, what was it?
What came after captain?

175
00:06:36,248 --> 00:06:38,990
I can't seem to remember
for dramatic effect.

176
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,687
- I wanted to be commissioner.

177
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:43,385
- Gina Moment.
- I get your point.

178
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,823
Even the best laid plans
sometimes don't work out.

179
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:47,389
- They sure don't.
And now it's time

180
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:48,826
for Gina's closing thoughts.

181
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,741
Just because
you wanna do something

182
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,264
doesn't mean
you get to do it.

183
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:56,007
Life is chaos, success is
completely arbitrary,

184
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,357
and confidence is everything.

185
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,186
- I was just worried.

186
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:04,885
But I guess after working
with you for five years,

187
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,539
I should've realized...

188
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:09,977
You know what you're doing.
- Thanks, Captain.

189
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,459
- Have you
thought this through?

190
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,983
- Not at all. And yet...

191
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:17,463
Checkmate.
- That was completely illegal.

192
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:18,899
That's not at all
how the queen moves.

193
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:20,771
- That's how this queen moves.
Checkmate.

194
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,076
- It's against
the rules of chess.

195
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,209
- Well, Gina Linetti done
reinvented the game.

196
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:26,254
- Uh, I'm supporting
your overall career decision,

197
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:27,821
I'm on board,
but you can't assignâ

198
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,910
I won both things.

199
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:31,782
Chess and the argument.

200
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,567
This little birdie,
she gotta fly the coop.

201
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,526
I'm taking this with me
as a little remembrance, Sir.

202
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,791
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!
Ca-caw!

203
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,273
- Hey.
What are you two up to?

204
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:46,709
- Eh, I'm on my phone

205
00:07:46,753 --> 00:07:48,755
and Rosa's just
sitting there silently.

206
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,844
The yewzh.
- Well, I was thinking

207
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,846
we could have
a ladies lunch today.

208
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,283
- Amy, I wish I could
do lunch today,

209
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:56,894
but I'm currently out of town.

210
00:07:56,937 --> 00:08:00,158
- Oh, come on. I wanna hang out
one last time before youâ

211
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,594
before you leave us.

212
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:03,291
You're really special, Gina,

213
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:04,727
and even thoughâ

214
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:07,121
I'm sorry.
I just get so emotional

215
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:08,775
about these things,
you know?

216
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,255
I wish I could be
more like Rosa.

217
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:11,778
- Huh? I got bored.
What's going on?

218
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,432
- See? She doesn't
even give a damn.

219
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:15,086
I wish I could do that.

220
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,652
Then I would cry less
at the bank.

221
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,132
It's just
there's this one poster

222
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:21,353
of this older Asian man
opening up a savings account

223
00:08:21,396 --> 00:08:23,224
for his grandson.
- Okay.

224
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:24,878
All right, here's what's
gonna happen.

225
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,794
Amy Santiago,
as my parting gift to you,

226
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,448
before I leave your life
foreverâ

227
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,102
- We'll still see each other
outside of work.

228
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:32,886
- Before I leave your life
forever, I'm gonna fix you.

229
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,627
I'm gonna teach you
how to be more cool

230
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,195
and detached like me and Rosa.
- What's going on?

231
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,110
- But we could still
go to lunch, right?

232
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,503
I meanâ
or not.

233
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:43,027
Whatevs.
- Decent start.

234
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,116
Yeah, sure, I mean,
we'll go to lunch with you.

235
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,205
Why not?
- Okay, okay, cool.

236
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:50,077
Just before we go, I'm gonna go
to go the bathroom for a bit.

237
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,470
Not to cry about you leaving.

238
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:53,951
But just to take a huge dump.

239
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:57,128
So if you hear any crying
from the bathroom...

240
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:59,434
Not about you.

241
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:00,958
It's the dump.

242
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,263
Okay?

243
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:03,917
- Gina,
since you're leaving,

244
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,527
I'd like to make a toast.

245
00:09:05,571 --> 00:09:07,181
Bye.

246
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:08,487
- Oh, my God.
That was perfect.

247
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,836
- Mm.
- So nice.

248
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,837
Gina, I got a little

249
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,621
going away
present for you.

250
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:15,146
Don't worry.
It's nothing big.

251
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,496
- Oh, my goodness. Wow.

252
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:18,976
- You once said
if you ever die,

253
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,500
you wanted someone to turn
your tweets into a book,

254
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:23,415
so that's what I did.

255
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,244
- Oh, my God. I said
so many witty things so fast.

256
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:27,680
- Yeah.

257
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:28,899
- Amy, I don't know
what to say.

258
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:30,770
This is horrifying.
- What?

259
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:32,337
- This is way worse
than crying.

260
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,991
I mean, you put so much work
into this.

261
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,863
I'm completely uncomfortable.
It makes me...

262
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:38,212
Kinda makes me sick.

263
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:40,911
Amy, there's something
I want you to do right now.

264
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:43,609
- Burn the book I made you?
- Yes.

265
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,959
It's the only way to cleanse
your childish sentimentality

266
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,006
and become the true you,
the one that's really Rosa.

267
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,051
- Okay.

268
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:52,183
Sure.

269
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,488
I mean, it does include

270
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:55,360
a very personal forward
I wrote

271
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:58,189
and $75 of my best
archival glue,

272
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:00,278
but... yeah, this feels good.

273
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:03,194
- Hey. Never seen you burning
stuff at the bum barrel before.

274
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,717
Right on.

275
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,632
- What was in there, Hitchcock?
- Eh, eh, eh.

276
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,112
First rule of the bum barrel:

277
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:10,201
never ask somebody
what they're burning.

278
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:12,159
- Well, okay then.

279
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:13,465
All right Amy, it's time.

280
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:15,554
Put the book in the barrel.
Let's go.

281
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,731
- No! I can't do it.

282
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:20,863
- What? I thought you wanted us
to change you.

283
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:22,909
- I thought I did too,
but I don't.

284
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:26,695
I like having emotions, okay?
This is who I am.

285
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,002
You're leaving
and that's a really big change

286
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:32,005
and I'm gonna cry about it
a lot, okay?

287
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,224
- And there it is.

288
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,052
Another flawless
Gina Moment.

289
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,401
- What? What's going on?

290
00:10:36,444 --> 00:10:38,316
- Amy, the lesson I wanted
to leave you with

291
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:40,274
is to just be yourself.

292
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:42,189
If you want to cry
like an idiot

293
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,930
for hours on end,
just do it.

294
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:45,453
You wanna make
a big old ugly book

295
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:48,065
full of all my brilliant
thoughts, do it.

296
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:49,457
Do you!

297
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:52,547
- Thanks, Gina.

298
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:57,900
- Oh, wow.

299
00:10:57,944 --> 00:10:59,467
That was really, really sweet.

300
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,731
- Oh, dip! I got Rosa
to feel her feelings too?

301
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:05,082
Inadvertent Gina Moment.
Two for one.

302
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,127
- Come in, my babies.

303
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,607
Come in.

304
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,956
- Sorry to interrupt,
ladies, but you might

305
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,392
want to take
a couple of steps back.

306
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,394
This is not
going to smell good.

307
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:14,743
- Un-hug! Un-hug!
- Ugh!

308
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:19,226
- Hey, does anyone have
a contact at Ellis Island?

309
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,227
- Ellis Island?

310
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:21,402
What's going on?

311
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:22,664
- I'm trying to secure
a cool venue

312
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,144
for Gina's going away party,
Gina-rama.

313
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:25,928
- Oh, that invitation said
"Geena-rama"

314
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:27,582
not "Gyna-rama."

315
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:29,280
I thought it was weird they'd
move Gyna-rama from Tampa.

316
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,759
It's really
a warm weather event.

317
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:33,110
- Wait, I'm confused.
Did the Met fall through?

318
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:35,068
- That place is stuffy
and lame.

319
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,635
And also, it's $12 million.

320
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:39,551
But the point is, I decided.
It was my call.

321
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,901
- Just have it at Shaw's.
It doesn't have to be splashy.

322
00:11:41,944 --> 00:11:43,294
- It's a party for Gina.

323
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,947
It absolutely has to be
splashy, Terrence.

324
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,123
- Terrence, would you jump into

325
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,428
a pool without water?

326
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,169
No, the splash
is what keeps you alive.

327
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:51,171
Splash is life.
- I know what you need.

328
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:53,260
An insane devil stick
performance.

329
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:55,349
I have a brand-new routine
that is steamy.

330
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:56,785
- Boyle, we're looking
for splashy, not steamy,

331
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,309
but thank you.
- Well, steam is what

332
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:00,006
you get when you add
splash to fire.

333
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,399
- And we will not
keep you in mind.

334
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:02,748
Hey, that reminds me,
Gina, we still haven't

335
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,402
secured a celebrity guest
for the party.

336
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:06,099
How would you feel about the
guy who shot that video

337
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,622
of that rat
smoking a vape pen?

338
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,233
- Can we get the rat?
- Pretty sure the rat

339
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,669
is just a big ball of tumors
at this point.

340
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:12,105
Is that the vibe
you're going for?

341
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,324
- Maybe.
- If you want a celebrity,

342
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:15,674
I met Leroy Pipe
at Gyna-rama '08.

343
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:18,155
- I have a buddy who works
in private security.

344
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:19,808
They do protection
for tons of big names.

345
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,158
He'll know who's in town.

346
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:23,116
- Fantastic.
Please call him right now.

347
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,859
- No need. Leroy Pipe is in!
All he needs is bail money.

348
00:12:26,902 --> 00:12:28,991
- Great. But also, Terry,
you still call your guy.

349
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:31,255
- Gotcha.
- Gina, big news.

350
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:32,604
Terry's friend got back to us

351
00:12:32,647 --> 00:12:34,127
and he says
they're doing security

352
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,129
for Bayside High's number one
wrestler:

353
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,130
A.C. Slater.

354
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,784
That's right, Mario Lopez.

355
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:40,960
- Oh, my God.
I had such a big crush on him.

356
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:43,484
- Yeah, we all had a big crush
on A.C. Slater.

357
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,530
Get in line!

358
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,097
I'll be cooler
when we meet him.

359
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,968
- I should hope so.
- Anyways, he's hanging out

360
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:50,187
at the Manhattan Club
right now.

361
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,318
We can go there
and try and talk to him.

362
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:52,667
- Jake, you can't just walk

363
00:12:52,711 --> 00:12:55,017
into the Manhattan Club.
It's very exclusive.

364
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:57,237
- Like, how exclusive are we
talking here, Gines? No jeans?

365
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:58,543
- More.
- No poor people of any kind

366
00:12:58,586 --> 00:12:59,761
no matter how well
they hide it?

367
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:01,154
- More.
- Just a tiny slice

368
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,155
of the super rich?
- More.

369
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,461
- Is it all Illuminati?

370
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:04,592
Is it just a whole room
full of lizards?

371
00:13:04,636 --> 00:13:06,159
- Bingo.
- Well, then I guess

372
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,030
we'll have to transform
ourselves.

373
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:09,510
Into the uber wealthy.

374
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,437
Charles!
Turn that music off.

375
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:24,786
- Oh, sorry. I was just
practicing

376
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,440
in case you guys
change your mind.

377
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:28,877
- Okay, we're about to walk
into the land of money.

378
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,880
Remember, all rich people are
monsters, so unleash the beast.

379
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:33,186
- Got it.

380
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,796
Open it!

381
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,451
- Good afternoon.
May I help you?

382
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:38,583
- We're here all the time.

383
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:40,062
Get familiar with these faces,

384
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:41,803
or get familiar
with the unemployment line.

385
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:44,197
- I'm so sorry, but I have to
check you in.

386
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,459
I need a member number.

387
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:48,070
- I don't have my member number
with me.

388
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:50,551
It's too bad you can't just use
my AmEx black card.

389
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,118
- Oh, that's great.
We can use that.

390
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:53,641
- You can? Well.

391
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:55,556
You think I carry around
my own wallet?

392
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,214
- I'm sorry, sir. If you could
just give me a name,

393
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,389
that would be great.

394
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,869
- I'll give you a name:

395
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:05,349
Pamplemouse La Croix.

396
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:07,089
- I'm so sorry, Ms. La Croix,

397
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,090
you're not in the system.

398
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:09,222
- This is ridiculous.

399
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,397
You know what?

400
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:12,269
Call Daddy.
Daddy'll get us in.

401
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,359
- Daddy, the man won't let us
into the club.

402
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,318
- Oh, ho, ho.
- Yes, Daddy. No, Daddy, no.

403
00:14:18,362 --> 00:14:20,538
Daddy wants to speak with you.
- Gladly.

404
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:23,758
Hello, Daddy? Yes, Daddy.
NO, Daddy.

405
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:24,672
Daddy!

406
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:26,544
Oh, well, good question, Daddy.

407
00:14:26,587 --> 00:14:28,676
Daddy wants to get
this young man fired.

408
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,330
What is
your first and last name?

409
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:32,289
Uh..

410
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,726
You know what, forget about it.
You can just go on up.

411
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,903
- Fantastic.
Everything's well, Daddy.

412
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:40,166
We're heading in, Daddy.

413
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,863
Gina, the bathrooms here are
amazing.

414
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:43,604
I just peed on gold.
I peed on gold!

415
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,345
- That's so dope,
but we don't have time.

416
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:47,042
Mario Lopez is right there
in the VIP.

417
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,609
- So, how do we get him
to come to your party?

418
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:49,784
Say we're his biggest fans?
- No, Jake.

419
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:51,743
Celebrities despise their fans.

420
00:14:51,786 --> 00:14:53,440
You get into entertainment
to be removed

421
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:55,312
from general society.
- Oh, okay.

422
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:57,139
So what do we say?
- Well, whilst stars

423
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:58,793
hate people,
they love animals.

424
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:00,969
'Cause animals have bad bodies
so they're no competition.

425
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:03,058
- Okay, so we say the party
is for monkeys.

426
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,278
- Monkeys with malaria.
- Malnourished malaria monkeys.

427
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,975
- God, it's ridiculous how good
we are at this.

428
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,760
Let's go in.
- Wait, I don't think

429
00:15:08,803 --> 00:15:10,370
there's any way we're getting
past those security guards.

430
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:11,937
We need a distraction.
Ooh, how about this.

431
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,199
I'll sprint past them,

432
00:15:13,243 --> 00:15:14,200
and whilst
they're chasing after me,

433
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,810
you sneak into the VIP.

434
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:18,030
- Wow, we said "whilst" twice
in this conversation.

435
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:20,162
- I know, this place is really
rubbing off on us.

436
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:27,605
Heads up! Catch me if youâ
did! You immediately did!

437
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:31,348
Stop it! I'm telling Daddy!
Daddy!

438
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,568
Ow. Ow. Ow.

439
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:35,743
Hey.
- Hey, homey. You okay?

440
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:37,179
- Yeah, I'm totally fine.

441
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:38,442
It really wasn't that bad
of a beating.

442
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:39,834
I don't know
why I'm lying.

443
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:41,314
You were there.
You held me as I wept.

444
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,011
Anyways,
sorry that Gina-rama has been

445
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,317
a little basic so far,

446
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,840
but all of that
is about to change.

447
00:15:45,884 --> 00:15:48,016
Because guess who just
pulled up outside?

448
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,674
- He came?
Together: A.C. Sla-t-er!

449
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:55,720
- Yes, dude!

450
00:15:55,763 --> 00:15:56,764
- I'm sorry!

451
00:15:56,808 --> 00:15:59,419
- Everyone, be cool!
He's here!

452
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:03,205
- Hey, is this
the hungry monkey thing?

453
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:05,469
- It sure is, A.C. Slater!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lopez.

454
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:07,514
I know you're not actually
the very iconic character

455
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:09,037
that you played.
- You sure about that, preppy?

456
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,909
- This is the best
moment of my life.

457
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:13,041
- So what's up? Can I, uh,
come in and get a drink?

458
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:15,522
- Mm, actually, I'm sorry,
the venue's at capacity.

459
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:17,394
There's just too many people
inside.

460
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:18,569
- What?
- Wait, I was told

461
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:20,092
that this event depended on me.

462
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:21,920
You just begged me, like,
an hour ago.

463
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:23,791
- And now I'm begging you
to stop embarrassing yourself

464
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,140
'cause it's not a good shade
on you.

465
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:26,881
- Are you really not gonna
let me in?

466
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:28,579
- There's nothing I can do,
I'm sorâhey, Scully.

467
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,364
- Hi, Gina. I brought
my own pigs in a blanket!

468
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,887
- Dope.
- Who's that guy?

469
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:35,368
- Scully.
- Mario, you gotta calm down.

470
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,196
And you gotta walk away.
It's over.

471
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,548
Hey, Gina!

472
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:43,507
What are you doing?
We had A.C. Slater right there

473
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,769
and you turned him away?
- And that, Jake,

474
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:46,205
was your Gina Moment.

475
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:48,903
- What? But that sucked.
Why was mine a bad one?

476
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,862
- Because Jake, I wanted you
to understand

477
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:53,691
I don't need a celebrity
or some crazy venue

478
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,301
or a huge good-bye party.

479
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:56,781
This is what I wanted.

480
00:16:56,824 --> 00:16:59,610
Just to hang with my friends
and have a few drinks

481
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:02,439
and laugh at Charles
with his devil sticks

482
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:04,354
until he makes eye contactâ

483
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:05,877
you're killing it, bud.

484
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,445
You guys are
all the splash that I need.

485
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,099
- Oh, man.

486
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:12,753
Gina.
- Mm-hmm.

487
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,755
- You big cheese ball.
- I know.

488
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,932
Plus, it's so cool that I got
to turn a celebrity

489
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:20,805
away from my party. That was
kinda my Gina Moment for me.

490
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:22,067
I've always wanted to do that.

491
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,895
- Right. Right.
- Hey, um...

492
00:17:23,938 --> 00:17:26,245
It's raining outside.
Is it cool if I just wait here

493
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:28,465
until my car comes?
- Get out of here, Slater!

494
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:30,423
Get out! Yeah?

495
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,772
- Yeah!

496
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:36,081
- I can't believe Gina's gone.

497
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:37,256
- Me neither.

498
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:38,562
Hey, did you get
a Gina Moment?

499
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,172
She said she was giving one
to everyone,

500
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:41,478
but I didn't get mine.
- 'Sup, losers.

501
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,349
- Oh! What are you doing here,
Gina?

502
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,743
- Are you back? Did my begging
change your mind?

503
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:47,919
- Nah, dog. I'm just tying up
some loose ends.

504
00:17:47,962 --> 00:17:50,530
- Gina, why are you still here?
- Jeez. What's the big deal?

505
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:52,663
- It's just you made us all
toasts at Gina-rama

506
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,317
and say tearful goodbyes,
but now you're still here.

507
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:56,928
- I'm not back. I'm just
cleaning out my desk

508
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,366
And I have some stuff
I wanted to give to you guys.

509
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,803
Charles, weirdly,
you're kind of the person

510
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:04,762
I'm the closest to here.
Don't say why.

511
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,459
- Because I was your brother
and your lover?

512
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,330
Sorry, I can't control
my tongue around you.

513
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:09,680
- All right, well, here.

514
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,638
- The Boyle family mother
dough starter!

515
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,510
I'll think of you
every time I handle her.

516
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,555
- Oh, man. You know, I never
really understood

517
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,557
the logic behind
the two of us.

518
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:19,559
But I love you
and I'm gonna miss you.

519
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:21,692
- I'm gonna miss you too, Gina.
- You're getting cold feet.

520
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,607
I mean, why haven't you cleaned
out your desk

521
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,566
over your last two weeks?
- Because, Terry, I was busy

522
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,613
giving each and every one of
you a beautiful GM.

523
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:32,616
- Well, not all of us.
- Oh, Terry, that reminds me.

524
00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:34,661
Rosa, do you want this plant?

525
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,489
- Yeah. I mess with orchids.
- Great.

526
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,709
Well, that about wraps up
everything I meant to do.

527
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,058
- Come on.

528
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,756
- I wonder if Holt's gonna hire
a new assistant.

529
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,671
- Well, he can't hire someone
permanent right away.

530
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,673
He needs a rebound assistant
first.

531
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:48,980
- It's gonna be so weird
seeing someone at Gina'sâ

532
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:51,069
Oh. She's still here.

533
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,766
- Gina, what's going on?
- Cold feet.

534
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,899
She's never going to leave.
- No, I wanted to make sure

535
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:57,467
Holt was familiar
with my filing system.

536
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,120
I didn't want to
leave him in the dark.

537
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:00,470
- There are no dividers.

538
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:02,384
It's just a big pile
of loose papers.

539
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:04,038
- Okay, yeah, you get it.

540
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:05,518
I'll stick around
the rest of the day

541
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:06,519
in case you have
any questions.

542
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,825
- Never gonna leave!

543
00:19:07,868 --> 00:19:10,088
- She's definitely
still gonna be here.

544
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:12,351
- No way. She's gone.
Hah! Look!

545
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:13,613
Her desk, I told you,
it's empty.

546
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:15,528
- She's right over there
burning stuff.

547
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:18,488
- I'm just sage-ing. Trying to
clear this place of my energy.

548
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:19,880
- Why?
- Cold feet.

549
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:22,622
- No. No one's paying me
for my vibes anymore.

550
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,363
I'm not trying to give 'em away
for free.

551
00:19:24,406 --> 00:19:26,278
- Oh, my God.
I know what's going on.

552
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:27,758
Gina, you're having second
thoughts.

553
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,281
You have cold feet.
I figured it out!

554
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:30,804
- Jake for the win.
There you go.

555
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:32,632
- Come on, man!
- I never have second thoughts.

556
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:35,505
That's the luxury of having
great first thoughts.

557
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:37,376
- Gina, it's okay.
You're scared.

558
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:38,812
- Tare-bear, I love you,
but don't try

559
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:40,292
and hop on my thing, okay?
- But for real.

560
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:41,554
I'm not scared.

561
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:45,210
- Hey, guys. You were right.

562
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:47,386
I'm scared as hell.
Anyway.

563
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:49,867
I'm here all day.
- Huh.

564
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,652
All right. I think we need to
all get on the same page

565
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:54,349
for what do to
about this Gina situation.

566
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,655
- Well, we should tell her
we believe in her.

567
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,396
- Good point, Charles.
- And we all know

568
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,702
she'll succeed
at whatever she tries.

569
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:00,573
- I feel like this is
all my fault.

570
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,793
She's staying for me.
She just can't let go.

571
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:04,359
- Hitchcock, you don't have to
contribute.

572
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,491
All right, guys, let's get in
there

573
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:06,971
and support the hell
out of Gina.

574
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,322
What is that?

575
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:11,410
- It's a statue of her.

576
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:12,585
- Texting on her phone.

577
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,196
- Guys, look, there's a note.

578
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,633
- Hello, Nine-Nine.

579
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:18,722
I just wanted to thank
you guys.

580
00:20:18,765 --> 00:20:20,506
I was so nervous to move on

581
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,334
and I even started
to doubt myself,

582
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:23,770
which is crazy.

583
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:26,425
And your kind words really
helped me,

584
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:29,036
especially yours, Terry.
- Aww.

585
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,603
- Psych!

586
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,910
Did he fall fâ
Terry, did you fall for it?

587
00:20:32,953 --> 00:20:35,565
Anyway, Terry,
that's your Gina Moment.

588
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,784
- Seriously? I've known her
for seven years.

589
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:40,613
- JK again. I'm really gonna
miss you, Sarge.

590
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,267
I signed you up
for an international

591
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,616
yogurt of the month club.

592
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,705
Austria is in the fridge
right now.

593
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:47,751
- Terry's never had
Austrian yogurt before.

594
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:49,579
Terry had the best moment
of all.

595
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:51,581
- Anyway, I didn't doubt
myself for one second.

596
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:53,452
And I'm more confident
than I've ever been.

597
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:56,150
I was only stalling because
there was a shipping delay

598
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,370
with my golden statue.
- Ah, that makes sense.

599
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:00,764
- And even though she looks
like she has wet hair

600
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:03,636
and just combed through
a deep conditioning treatment,

601
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,638
and even though her jeans
look cheap

602
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,901
and even though she has
sausage fingers,

603
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:10,730
I hope it reminds you of me,
and I'm gonna miss you.

604
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:13,820
I'll hold now for a five
minute applause break.

605
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,997
Do it! Please.

606
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,654
- Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

607
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,960
- This feels right.

608
00:21:23,003 --> 00:21:24,178
- I love you guys.

609
00:21:24,222 --> 00:21:26,180
- Fremulon.

610
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:28,182
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
