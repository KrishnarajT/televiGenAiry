1
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:07,619
Another cold brew?

2
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:10,231
Don't mind if I "cold do."
Nailed it.

3
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:12,363
I am loving this machine
that Charles brought in.

4
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,365
- It is nice.
The trick is to let the coffee

5
00:00:14,409 --> 00:00:15,540
warm up to room temperature.

6
00:00:15,584 --> 00:00:16,846
I'm already on my second cup.

7
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:18,021
- This is my third.

8
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:20,284
Stop!

9
00:00:20,328 --> 00:00:22,852
You're drinking too much!

10
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:23,853
- Whoa, what's going on,
Charles?

11
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:25,289
Why are you talking so slow?

12
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,944
- I'm not.
I'm normal.

13
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,599
We're all normal.

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,387
- If you're not going slow,
that means we're going fast.

15
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:38,302
Are we going fast? Can anyone
tell if we're going fast?

16
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:39,825
- I don't think we're going fast
at all in any way whatsoever.

17
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,566
I feel like we're going slow
in every way whatsoever.

18
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,307
Captain, how do you feel?
- Great. Excellent. Amazing.

19
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,656
I feel better than
I've ever felt at any moment

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,657
in my entire life.
- So we're all fine?

21
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:47,050
all: Yep.

22
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,683
- Hey there, Captain.
Oh, is this your new assistant?

23
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:12,989
- John Urblan.
Nice to meet ya.

24
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,599
- And John Urblan
has just been fired.

25
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:15,905
- What?
- I have?

26
00:01:15,948 --> 00:01:17,602
- Meet "ya"?
You just abbreviated

27
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:18,995
a one-syllable word.

28
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:20,344
- Is this for real?
- Yes.

29
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:22,477
Now clean out your "des."

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,305
I removed the K
so you'd understand

31
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:26,350
how absurd "ya" sound.

32
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:28,787
- Oh, boy.
Sorry, John Urblan. Bye.

33
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,876
Okay, sir, so that is
the third assistant

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,356
you've fired in three days.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,315
- Because all the candidates
are garbage.

36
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,708
Microsoft Word
is not a special skill,

37
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:38,406
Marcie Lux from South Orange.

38
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:40,582
- Come on, look at the size
of that stack of résumés.

39
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,105
There's got to be someone good.

40
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:43,933
- Oh, yes, perhaps I should
keep an open mind.

41
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:46,718
Perhaps cross-country skiing
is a valuable skill

42
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:49,765
in an office environment,
Marcie Lux of South Orange.

43
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:51,462
- Okay, so we can agree
Marcie Lux is out of the mix.

44
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:52,811
- Well, they all are.

45
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:53,986
I'll just make do
with no assistant.

46
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,510
- No, don't just give up.

47
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:57,381
Maybe you haven't found
the right person yet.

48
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:58,948
I found Gina.
Maybe I could try.

49
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,037
- Okay.
I suppose it's worth a shot.

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,734
I can always fire
whoever you choose.

51
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:04,040
- Yeah, that's the spirit.

52
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,825
Commence Operation: Nasty.

53
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,394
New Assistant Selection Team...

54
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:11,917
You.

55
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,354
- Operation: New Assistant
Selection Team You?

56
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:14,659
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

57
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:15,921
Everyone will just call it
Operation: Nasty.

58
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:16,966
- You don't have
to turn everything

59
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,402
into a Thomas Cruise film.

60
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:19,664
- Why not?
Movies are super fun.

61
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:20,926
Meanwhile, real life
is very boring.

62
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,493
That's why no one watches
documentaries.

63
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:23,886
- Tell that to the man
sitting next to me

64
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:25,496
at last Saturday afternoon's
screening

65
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,412
of "Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda."

66
00:02:28,456 --> 00:02:30,675
- Was that man Kevin?

67
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,937
- Yes.
- All right,

68
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,461
I'm gonna help you find
a new assistant.

69
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:35,376
Operation: Nasty is a go!

70
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,942
- Hey, can I talk to you guys?

71
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:39,423
- Ugh, you're not selling those
crapola candy bars

72
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,903
for your daughters' doomed
basketball team again, are you?

73
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,034
- Doomed?
- Yeah.

74
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,166
They're terrible
and you know it.

75
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:44,994
- Well, I'm not selling candy.

76
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:46,648
That's next week.
Please bring cash.

77
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,650
What I want to talk about
is how our office

78
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:50,042
has turned into a junkyard.

79
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,783
- Yeah, you know,
this place is a mess.

80
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:53,045
I mean, it's like an episode
of "Hoarders."

81
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,612
- And not one
of the funny ones,

82
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:55,918
where they find a bunch
of flat cats.

83
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,441
The problem is,
Commissioner Kelly

84
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:58,877
is never gonna reopen
the first floor.

85
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,749
We should just fire
some of the uniforms.

86
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,533
But not you.
Uh, we couldn't survive

87
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,187
without you, Greg, and...

88
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,188
also Greg?

89
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,407
- James and Michael.

90
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,973
- No one is getting fired.

91
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:09,627
We just need to organize
this place.

92
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,151
- Nah, do what I do.
Embrace the mess.

93
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:14,066
- You've got a bagel
stuck to your sweater.

94
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,894
- Look, I don't want to sound
like a Scully here,

95
00:03:15,938 --> 00:03:17,548
but I think it's hopeless.

96
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:19,724
Nobody could organize
this place.

97
00:03:19,768 --> 00:03:21,465
- Nobody?
- Here's what I need.

98
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,075
Sticky notes,
three sizes, ten colors.

99
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,599
Permanent markers,
clickable only.

100
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:25,861
I don't want caps
slowing us down.

101
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:27,689
And I need garbage bags,
33 gallon,

102
00:03:27,732 --> 00:03:29,473
blackout, cinch top.

103
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:30,474
What are you all
still doing here?

104
00:03:30,518 --> 00:03:32,128
Go, go, go!

105
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,130
- Captain Holt,

106
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,567
I'd like to introduce you
to your new assistant.

107
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,090
Drumroll, please.

108
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,488
That's your drumroll?
- When a tempo isn't specified,

109
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:46,447
any reasonable person
would default to lento.

110
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,492
- Well, it's terrible,
and you ruined a fun thing,

111
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:49,972
but I would still like
to introduce you

112
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:52,191
to Mr. Gordon Lundt!

113
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,891
Mr. Gordon Lundt!

114
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:57,762
Gordon,
you want to come in here?

115
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,547
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

116
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,200
I was just deciding whether
I should just go home.

117
00:04:01,244 --> 00:04:03,115
The tone and tenor
of your introduction

118
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,117
make me worry that this is
a "fun" office,

119
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,728
which I would not enjoy.

120
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:07,903
- Ehh?

121
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:09,513
- Hello,
I'm Captain Raymond Holt,

122
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:12,124
and I can assure you,
this is not a fun office.

123
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,691
- Thank goodness.

124
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:15,867
In that case,
my interest is renewed.

125
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:18,522
Here is my résumé.
- Oh, I'm feeling this.

126
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:20,045
Are you guys feeling this?
Gordon, why don't you

127
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,699
tell Captain Holt
a little bit about yourself?

128
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:24,006
- Where to begin?
I'm 174 centimeters tall,

129
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:25,834
I can type
103 words per minute

130
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:27,966
with an error rate of 1.6%,

131
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,012
and I recently moved here
from Philadelphia,

132
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:31,927
which is the sixth
most populous U.S. city.

133
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,276
- I understand the city
of Philadelphia

134
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,234
is coterminous
with Philadelphia County,

135
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:38,237
making it the eighth-largest
metropolitan statistical area.

136
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,239
- Yeah, Philly's cool.
Isn't it fun

137
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,241
just telling each other facts?
both: Yes.

138
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:43,982
- Well, I think I have
all the information I need.

139
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:45,027
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Lundt.

140
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,637
- My pleasure.

141
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:48,509
- So...

142
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:50,772
looks like Operation: Nasty
is a full-on success, huh?

143
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,904
- You mean Operation:
Nasty Sex Slut.

144
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,559
- Didn't you see him flirting
with me?

145
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:56,908
- No, I most definitely
did not.

146
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:58,562
- Then you're a blind man
and a prude to boot.

147
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,042
Did you see his tie?
A single Windsor.

148
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,826
The easiest knot to undo.

149
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,567
Why bother wearing
any clothes at all?

150
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,177
- I think you badly misread
that interaction.

151
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,832
- Please. He did everything
but lick his lips and purr.

152
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:08,964
Get rid of him,
and bring me someone

153
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:10,748
who can keep it
in their slacks.

154
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,228
- Did someone say
to take off our slacks?

155
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,969
- No, not even close.

156
00:05:14,012 --> 00:05:15,536
- Oh.
Well, keep me posted.

157
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,973
My dogs are barkin'.

158
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,714
- What dogs?

159
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:22,194
- Okay, Marie Kondo
came up with a system

160
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,545
to unclutter your life.
You look at an object,

161
00:05:24,588 --> 00:05:25,937
and if it doesn't
bring you joy,

162
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,939
you throw it away.
Try it, Sarge.

163
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:29,245
- Hello,
backup pair of suspenders.

164
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,725
Do you bring me joy?

165
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:32,683
Yes,
because you have tab endings

166
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:34,032
and a sweet leather yoke.

167
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:35,904
I'm so glad you're in my life.

168
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:37,688
I guess I'm keeping 'em.
- Ooh, let me try.

169
00:05:37,732 --> 00:05:39,864
Hello,
bag of old dried mushrooms.

170
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,997
Do you bring me joy?
Yes!

171
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,696
You provide rich, earthy flavor
to both soups and teas.

172
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,655
I guess I'm keeping mine too.
This is fun.

173
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:48,873
- Guys, you can't keep
everything.

174
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,353
That defeats the purpose.

175
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:52,660
- I got this, Ames.
Hello, unsolved case.

176
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:54,096
Do you bring me joy?

177
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,837
No, because you're boring
and you're too hard.

178
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,925
See ya.

179
00:05:56,968 --> 00:05:58,709
- Personal items only, Scully.

180
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:00,189
Get that case out of the trash.

181
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,234
- Oh, for Pete's sake.

182
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,628
- Sir, we need to talk
about Gordon Lundt,

183
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:05,934
and before you ask,

184
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:07,631
I have not fired him.
- Yes, I noticed.

185
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,720
He's been strutting around
like a peacock,

186
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:11,679
trying desperately
to arouse me,

187
00:06:11,722 --> 00:06:13,681
his unwilling peahen.

188
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,247
- Did you hear
there's a barrel-making exhibit

189
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,945
at the Brooklyn Museum
of Industry?

190
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:18,729
- Yes.

191
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:21,689
Has he no shame?
The door was open.

192
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:22,951
I think he wanted people
to hear.

193
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,256
- Yeah, well,
I didn't fire him

194
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,606
because I thought
you were being crazy

195
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:26,955
and I wanted
to change your mind,

196
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,870
so I called all the places
he used to work.

197
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:30,175
- You didn't do that
before you brought him in?

198
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,742
- What?
No, you check references

199
00:06:31,786 --> 00:06:33,657
after there's a problem.
That's hiring 101.

200
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:37,052
Anyways, it turns out he never
worked at the Philadelphia PD.

201
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:40,098
- So he's a liar and a hussy?
Why is he still here?

202
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:42,840
- Because I started thinking,
why would he lie?

203
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:44,712
And the answer is:

204
00:06:44,755 --> 00:06:46,670
because he's a spy,
planted here

205
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:48,280
by Commissioner Kelly.
Think about it.

206
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,369
You've been rounding up all
the captains who oppose him.

207
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,197
Kelly wants those names.

208
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,199
Gordon was sent here
to seduce you.

209
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:56,114
He's a red sparrow.
- You mean a honeypot.

210
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:57,942
- Potato, tomato,
but yes.

211
00:06:57,986 --> 00:07:00,423
He is the world's most boring
sex spy,

212
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,077
and he's here to infiltrate
the Nine-Nine.

213
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,644
- No, this is just you

214
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:04,993
still trying to make everything
into a movie.

215
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,777
This is the real world,
Peralta.

216
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:08,736
There are no spies
in our midst.

217
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:11,173
I'm sure Gordon just lied
on his résumé to get a job.

218
00:07:11,216 --> 00:07:14,742
- Oh, really? Then how come
he's in this old staff photo

219
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:16,134
from the Three-Six?

220
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:17,353
- Kelly's old precinct?

221
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,921
You're right.
Gordon's a honeypot.

222
00:07:19,964 --> 00:07:20,965
- Or a red sparrow.

223
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,663
- Buzz, buzz, little bee.

224
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:23,925
- Fly, bird, fly.

225
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:25,143
- Buzz.
- Fly.

226
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:26,231
- Buzz.
- Fly.

227
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,886
- Buzz.
- Fly.

228
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,019
The point is, we're on
the same page. He's a spy.

229
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:35,588
- Hey, Hitchcock.

230
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:36,720
God, you scared me.
I've got a razor.

231
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:38,287
- Sorry.
I need the bathroom.

232
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,897
- Fine, but you're lucky
I didn't cut myself.

233
00:07:39,941 --> 00:07:41,769
Yep, sure am.

234
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,597
Have a good one, buddy.

235
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:46,208
- Any poopers?
- None.

236
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,557
- What is this? Why are we
meeting in the bathroom?

237
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,298
- Super cool meeting spot.

238
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:51,474
- Don't roll your eyes at me,
Daria.

239
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:53,389
Commissioner Kelly sent a spy
into our midst.

240
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,391
This is happening.
We need to talk about our plan.

241
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,349
- Okay, here it is.
I'm going to fire him.

242
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,568
- You can't do that.

243
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,743
In a movie,
when you find out

244
00:07:59,787 --> 00:08:01,310
someone's a spy,
you don't fire them.

245
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:02,746
You can either
have them murdered...

246
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,661
- Not an option.
- Yeah, I know, we're cops.

247
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,489
Blah, blah.
No one likes this side of you.

248
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:08,012
Or we can launch
a counter-spying mission.

249
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,753
- I just want him out
of the Nine-Nine.

250
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,712
- If we can prove
that Kelly sent a spy

251
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,975
into one of his own precincts
to seduce a captain,

252
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:15,759
it's gonna look really bad
for him.

253
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,283
- And how will we prove that?
- With Operation: Dragon.

254
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:21,722
Don't Reveal Anything,
Gordon's Our Nemesis.

255
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:22,897
- No.
- I worked so hard

256
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,376
on that acronym.
You're not even

257
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,769
going to acknowledge it?
All right, look,

258
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,031
if Kelly's been communicating
with Gordon,

259
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,729
there has to be evidence
on his laptop.

260
00:08:28,772 --> 00:08:30,556
- Yeah, but he doesn't leave
his computer unattended.

261
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,558
It's always in his bag, which
he always has on his person.

262
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:33,734
- How do you know that?

263
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:34,909
- I've glanced
at his work satchel.

264
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,780
I'm married,
but I'm still a man.

265
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:38,564
- Choosing to ignore that.
Now, if there were only

266
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:41,263
some place where they make you
check your bag,

267
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:44,614
like an airport,
or even a museum?

268
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,355
- No.
I couldn't.

269
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:47,486
- Couldn't you?

270
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,792
- Mr. Lundt,
would you like to go

271
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:50,446
to the barrel-making exhibit
this evening?

272
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,665
- Yes, Captain Holt.
I could make time for that.

273
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,756
- I need a shower.

274
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,542
- Okay, I went through my desk
and got rid of everything

275
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:00,673
that didn't give me joy.

276
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:01,805
- You didn't get rid
of anything.

277
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:02,806
- Because it all gives me joy.

278
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,634
Picture of Nikolaj, joy.

279
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,724
Cocktail napkin from my
first date with Genevieve, joy.

280
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:09,944
Birthday card
from my urologist, joy.

281
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:11,641
He was the only doctor
of my entire

282
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,338
urethral support staff
who remembered.

283
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:15,950
- All right, I don't think
Marie Kondo's gonna work here.

284
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:18,300
We need something stronger.

285
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:20,824
The Norwegian system:
Munkensmat.

286
00:09:20,868 --> 00:09:22,478
It was designed
by a radical group

287
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,914
of Scandinavian organizers

288
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:25,307
who are doing things
with cubbies

289
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,613
that would blow your minds.

290
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:28,832
We need to Munkensmat.

291
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,791
- "Munkensmat"?
- Sexy, right?

292
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,881
In Munkensmat, you get rid
of all personal possessions

293
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:35,883
except one.
- I can't do that.

294
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,362
What, I'm just supposed
to get rid

295
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:39,495
of my great-grandfather's
shoes?

296
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,758
He had one baby foot.
This is cruel.

297
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:44,413
- Munkensmat isn't cruel.
It's freeing.

298
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:47,329
When you cling to these things,
you cling to the past,

299
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:49,853
and you don't leave room
for new experiences.

300
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:51,855
- Okay, what one thing
should I keep?

301
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,639
Hatchet or Blu-ray
of "The Intern"?

302
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:54,640
- You can always watch
"The Intern" online.

303
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:55,990
- Not the extras.

304
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:57,643
There's a virtual tour
of Jules' kitchen.

305
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:58,906
Monster.

306
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,690
- Well, Sarge,
what's it gonna be,

307
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,561
pictures of your kids
or those suspenders?

308
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,433
- Terry can't
throw his family away,

309
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:07,088
but these are nice suspenders.

310
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,698
- Are they special
in some kind of way?

311
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,700
- Damn, Amy, I told you
about the leather yoke!

312
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,398
- Terry, you're clinging.

313
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,531
Munkensmat.
- My turn.

314
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:16,880
It's between
my seizure medication

315
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,882
and this fidget spinner.

316
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:21,493
I think I made the right call.

317
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,540
Uh-oh.
I forgot that it lit up.

318
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,020
I've made a terrible mistake.

319
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:29,632
- Look at that.

320
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,155
They put the sherry barrels
right up front.

321
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:33,941
- Ugh. I hate it when museums
pander to the tourists.

322
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:35,768
Oh, I think you need to check
your bag, Gordon.

323
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,031
- It's a small price to pay

324
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:38,423
to make sure the barrels
are protected.

325
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,121
- My thoughts exactly.

326
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:41,949
The package is headed your way.
- Copy that.

327
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:45,126
- This better work.
I'm debasing myself out here.

328
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,997
What must people think?
- Relax.

329
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,565
There's literally
no other people at this museum.

330
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,655
Thank you very much.
Here is $100.

331
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:54,135
Pleasure doing business
with you.

332
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:55,571
- You know, you could have
just stolen the bag,

333
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,615
and wouldn't have noticed
or cared.

334
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,400
- Ugh. Be better, Yanya.

335
00:10:58,443 --> 00:11:00,576
- Okay.
- Yanya!

336
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:03,796
Okay, sir, I am cloning
the hard drive.

337
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,581
You should only
have to distract him for...

338
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,800
three hours?
Good Lord.

339
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,759
Do you think that you can talk
about barrels for three hours?

340
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,500
- Watch me.

341
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:14,895
Ah, Gordon, take a gander
at this brine barrel from 1787.

342
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:16,418
It looks to me like the work

343
00:11:16,461 --> 00:11:18,550
of master hooper
Josiah Wooldruff,

344
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,031
who learned the craft from
his father Jesiah Wooldruff,

345
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:22,554
who in turn learned it
from his.

346
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,034
- I'm already so bored.

347
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,167
- The slats are not flat.
They're curved.

348
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,995
The base of the barrel
is approximately 20...

349
00:11:28,038 --> 00:11:30,127
Every barrel is inspected
before usage.

350
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:32,738
The key is that the oak
was cured and shaped

351
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:34,653
by Josiah's cousin Joshua,

352
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:36,742
who was a cooper
and not a hooper.

353
00:11:36,786 --> 00:11:38,701
- Wait, are you still
at the same barrel?

354
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:40,181
Please move on to another one.

355
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:41,791
There are so many barrels
in there.

356
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,793
- You know what?
Let's look at that barrel.

357
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,969
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a brine barrel as well.

358
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:47,753
It was also made in the 1780s.

359
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:50,147
In fact, it's identical
to the last barrel.

360
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:51,975
Let's review
why that's interesting.

361
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,499
- No!

362
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:56,588
- Having each selected
our one item,

363
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,721
we move on to stage two,
cleansing.

364
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,462
In Munkensmat,
you don't just throw away

365
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:01,680
your discarded belongings.

366
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:02,986
You incinerate them.
- What?

367
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,509
Can't we just donate
this stuff?

368
00:12:04,553 --> 00:12:06,120
- So you can go to Goodwill
after work

369
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:08,818
and buy back those suspenders
you're so attached to?

370
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,255
- No.
- Now, in true Munkensmat,

371
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,170
you pile all of your belongings
on a raft,

372
00:12:13,214 --> 00:12:14,998
push it out to the icy sea,

373
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,174
and set fire to it
with a flaming arrow.

374
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:19,176
But since we obviously
don't have an archer—

375
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,700
- I'm an archer.
I have like six bows in my car.

376
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:22,745
- Really?

377
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,010
Launch.

378
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,711
Oh, Munkensmat.

379
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:33,843
- Munkensmat.

380
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,540
all: Munkensmat!

381
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:38,543
- Have you reviewed the
contents of Gordon's computer?

382
00:12:38,587 --> 00:12:39,675
Did you find anything?

383
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,634
- Uh, well,
hem, haw...

384
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,027
- Are you literally saying
"hem" and "haw"?

385
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:45,811
- Look, I haven't found
anything, okay?

386
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,162
Not a single email
between Kelly and Gordon.

387
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:50,729
- So I whored myself out
at that museum for nothing.

388
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:52,993
- Not entirely for nothing.
You know? We had fun.

389
00:12:53,036 --> 00:12:55,517
Sneaking around, bribing
people, lying, stealing stuff.

390
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,909
- Coming home
and having my husband ask me

391
00:12:56,953 --> 00:12:58,259
why I smelled like barrels?

392
00:12:58,302 --> 00:12:59,782
- Seriously?
What did you say?

393
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:01,044
- I told him everything.
He understood,

394
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:03,046
until I showed him a picture
of Gordon.

395
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,136
The thought of me at a museum
with that ten?

396
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,964
He banished me
to the guest room.

397
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:09,270
Captain Holt, are you in there?

398
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:10,923
- Oh, no, it's him.
What does he want?

399
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:11,924
- Do you think he knows
something happened

400
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:13,274
at the Barrel Museum?

401
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:14,840
- I wanted to talk to you
about something

402
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:15,972
that happened
at the Barrel Museum.

403
00:13:16,016 --> 00:13:17,887
- I think he knows.
This is bad!

404
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,845
- Well, the longer we talk,
the more suspicious it seems.

405
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:21,978
- Tell him to come in.
- Come in!

406
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:26,200
- Oh. I prefer to discuss
this matter in private.

407
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:27,723
- Anything you have to say
to me, you can say

408
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,290
in front of Peralta.
- Very well.

409
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,682
I've been sent here
to spy on you.

410
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,902
- What? I am truly shocked.

411
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,338
- We are both shocked.

412
00:13:34,382 --> 00:13:35,818
- Commissioner Kelly
knows you're recruiting

413
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:37,167
a team of captains
to oppose him.

414
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:39,082
He asked me to find out
who they are.

415
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:40,953
But I've decided
I won't help him.

416
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:42,564
- Why not?
- Because...

417
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:43,739
I've fallen in love with you.

418
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,610
- What?

419
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:47,743
That is truly shocking.

420
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,049
For real this time.
What?

421
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:52,791
- The plan was for me to weaken
your defenses

422
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:54,402
with my brazen sexuality.

423
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:55,751
- I wouldn't say "brazen"

424
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,231
so much as
"completely undetectable."

425
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:58,362
- I couldn't have been
more obvious.

426
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,885
I wore a single Windsor knot.

427
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:01,409
I might as well have a sign
around my neck

428
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:02,758
that reads "DTF."

429
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,151
- "Desiring Thorough
Fornication."

430
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:05,326
- Nope.
- Exactly.

431
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:06,370
- Oh.
- At first, the flirting

432
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:07,371
was just part of the ruse.

433
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:08,416
It meant nothing to me.

434
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,418
But then the Barrel Museum.

435
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:11,854
I fell hard.
- Not surprising.

436
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:13,638
It is an erotically charged
atmosphere.

437
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:15,162
The curve of the slats,

438
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:17,120
the rivets, the bilge,
the bunghole.

439
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:18,861
- Okay, I am actually starting
to hear the sex talk now.

440
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:20,297
- The bunghole is the least
erotic part of the barrel.

441
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:21,777
It's simply functional.
- Sure.

442
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,648
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Bunghole. Continue.

443
00:14:23,692 --> 00:14:25,520
- Captain, I know nothing
could ever happen between us,

444
00:14:25,563 --> 00:14:27,652
but I care about you too much
to do Kelly's dirty work,

445
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:29,219
which is why I'm tendering
my resignation.

446
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:30,655
- That's very honorable.
I accept.

447
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,918
- Oh, no, you don't.
This could be our chance.

448
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:35,573
We can turn Kelly's agent
into a double agent.

449
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:37,401
Operation: Double Dragon.

450
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:38,924
Oh, it's all starting
to happen.

451
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:41,797
- I don't want to play
these movie spy games, Peralta.

452
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,625
It could backfire.
- Or it could front-fire.

453
00:14:43,668 --> 00:14:45,148
- What?
- It worked.

454
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:46,628
Gordon, do you have
any hard proof

455
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:48,195
that Kelly sent you here?
- Nothing in writing.

456
00:14:48,238 --> 00:14:49,413
We only communicate in person.

457
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:50,893
- Okay, so you call Kelly,

458
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:52,721
arrange for a meeting,
then you wear a wire,

459
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:54,549
and we have tape
of the commissioner

460
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:55,854
admitting that he's spying
on one of his captains.

461
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:56,942
- It could work,
but I could never

462
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:58,596
put Gordon in that position.

463
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,945
- I would do anything for you,
Captain Holt.

464
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:02,296
- Thank you.
And you can call me Raymond.

465
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,775
Captain Raymond Holt.

466
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,168
- I don't think
that's such a good idea.

467
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:06,604
- You're right, too much.

468
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:07,649
That should never
have happened.

469
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:08,954
- Agreed.
- Wait, what?

470
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:10,521
Did something just happen?

471
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:11,653
I've been standing here
the whole time.

472
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:13,481
What did I miss?

473
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:15,265
What did I miss?

474
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,745
What did I miss?

475
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,703
- Hey, can I take
a couple photos of your desk?

476
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:20,749
I want to submit them
to "Organizers Quarterly."

477
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:21,837
- What?
- There's a magazine

478
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,578
about organizing?
- Yeah.

479
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,623
I want to be featured
as Organizer of the Month.

480
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:27,234
Just imagine,
me on the cover

481
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:29,366
with tons of scarves
lying around.

482
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,933
I'm holding them up like,

483
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:34,284
"This is too many scarves.
We got to do something!"

484
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:36,330
- Okay.

485
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,549
- Ooh, now can you open
the drawers?

486
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:39,942
If you want to get featured,
you got to show them

487
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:41,422
what's under the skirt,
know what I mean?

488
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:43,815
- Uh, no, there are case files
in here.

489
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,948
I don't want any sensitive info
to get out.

490
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:47,384
- I'll blur the personal stuff.

491
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,952
Come on,
this is the money shot.

492
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:52,694
Seriously, Terry?

493
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:54,565
You didn't throw out
the suspenders?

494
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,785
- What?
That's not fair.

495
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:58,917
I had to throw out Great
Grandpa Ellen's bitty shoe!

496
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:00,832
- Why are you even holding on
to these?

497
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,747
I've never seen you wear them.
- I haven't.

498
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:05,272
I saw them at the store, and
they're obviously way better

499
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:06,621
than my normal suspenders.

500
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:08,318
- Are they?
- Yeah!

501
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:09,928
Tab endings, leather yoke.

502
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,452
I can't keep describing them.

503
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:14,281
- All right, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

504
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:16,544
I bought them right before
I took the lieutenant's exam.

505
00:16:16,587 --> 00:16:18,807
I was gonna wear them on
my first day as a lieutenant,

506
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,591
but then I failed the test.

507
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:23,246
I thought I'd keep them
just in case I ever pass it,

508
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,467
but I'll be honest.

509
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,252
That's never gonna happen.

510
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:30,688
I'll just throw them out.

511
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:33,561
There.
You can take your photo now.

512
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,829
- The deadline's tomorrow.

513
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:42,396
- We're just listening
from afar.

514
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:43,745
Do we really need to be
in disguise?

515
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:45,573
- Yes, Carmine.
Yes, we do.

516
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:48,576
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Your cover is Carmine Frunch.

517
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:50,360
You have emphysema, and your
best friend is your pet bird.

518
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:51,970
- I'm not sure I like
this persona.

519
00:16:52,014 --> 00:16:53,711
- Well, if you make it
too cool, it's not believable.

520
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:55,670
By the way,
my name is Jackson Fox.

521
00:16:55,713 --> 00:16:56,932
I'm an NBA player,

522
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,412
and LeBron James
is my best friend.

523
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,283
Oh, here comes Kelly.

524
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:02,416
- So, Mr. Lundt.
Good to see you.

525
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:03,547
What's all this about?

526
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,809
- Captain Holt
and the Nine-Nine.

527
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:06,594
- That's it, Gordon.
Lure him in.

528
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:08,422
- He's plotting against you
with a group of captains.

529
00:17:08,465 --> 00:17:11,425
I'm only here because he asked
me to help him entrap you.

530
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:13,688
- What is happening?
- He's triple-crossing us.

531
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:15,777
- Holt is listening in
from that surveillance vehicle.

532
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,561
- Hey, Gordon,
can you still hear me?

533
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:19,998
- Yes.
- You are blowing this, man!

534
00:17:22,566 --> 00:17:24,612
- Oh, hi, Raymond.
Good to see you.

535
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,309
Pull up a chair.
- Cut the crap.

536
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:29,181
Stop masking your evil
with a candy cane smile.

537
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:30,835
- Ooh, I love candy canes.

538
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,533
- Everyone loves candy canes,
John Kelly.

539
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:34,012
Now admit you sent in
this boring bastard

540
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:35,362
to honeypot Holt.

541
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,624
- It feels like you two
are the spies

542
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,843
based on your disguises,
et cetera.

543
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:41,063
- Nuh-uh.
This is who we actually are.

544
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:42,456
A professional
basketball player

545
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,327
and a guy with a bird friend.

546
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:46,329
- Oh, it's not just
about disguises.

547
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:49,027
Everything that you recorded
on your wire

548
00:17:49,071 --> 00:17:52,640
clearly indicates that
I was the one being spied on.

549
00:17:52,683 --> 00:17:53,641
- Ow.
- Case closed.

550
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:55,338
Pretty cool, huh?

551
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:57,035
I can't wait to play that tape
for the mayor.

552
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,646
You are gonna look so bad,
Raymond.

553
00:17:58,689 --> 00:17:59,647
- You're never gonna get away
with this, Kelly.

554
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,039
- Oh, I already have.

555
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,519
Worked out better
than I expected.

556
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:04,956
I just sent Lundt in
to find out which captains

557
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,132
you'd rallied against me,
and then you decided

558
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:10,614
you wanted to bug
the commissioner of the NYPD.

559
00:18:10,658 --> 00:18:13,051
Somebody shot themselves
in the foot.

560
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:14,531
Hey, do me a favor.

561
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:17,012
Put your resignation on my desk
in the morning.

562
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,492
- I'm so sorry, sir.
This is all my fault.

563
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:20,320
Operation: Double Dragon
was a debacle.

564
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:22,191
- Yes, it was.

565
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,934
If only someone had thought
to plan a backup operation.

566
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:28,197
- Did you do something cool?
- I did something very cool.

567
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,894
While I was banished
to the guest room,

568
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:31,548
I flipped across one
of those Thomas Cruise films

569
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:34,377
on Home Box Office,
and I realized something.

570
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:38,294
On a spy mission,
there's always another twist.

571
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:39,600
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I knew

572
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:41,558
you would triple-cross
our double-cross,

573
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:44,387
so I planted a microphone
in the napkin holder.

574
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,910
There's one in the flowerpot.

575
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:47,999
Ketchup, mustard.
There are mics in both.

576
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,566
- Where?
- In the tips.

577
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,438
- Oh, this is so great.
Where else are there mics?

578
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:52,526
- Nowhere.
- Oh.

579
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:55,267
- But there are cameras!

580
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:57,269
There's a camera,
there's a camera,

581
00:18:57,313 --> 00:18:58,923
and there's a camera.

582
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:00,621
I've got you on tape, Kelly.
You're screwed.

583
00:19:00,664 --> 00:19:02,623
The only thing that's gonna be
on your desk in the morning

584
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,407
is a list of my demands.

585
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:06,409
Operation: Triple Dragon
is complete.

586
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,933
- You named it.
- Not only did I name it,

587
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:11,283
Triple Dragon is an acronym.

588
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:12,720
Two Righteous Individuals

589
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:14,591
Performing Law Enforcement
Directives Rapidly

590
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:17,072
Against Gordon Our Nemesis.
Triple Dragon!

591
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:20,249
- This is the best thing
that's ever happened!

592
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,077
I mean, not for you, obviously.

593
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,992
It's bad for you.

594
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:26,429
- What is all this junk
on my desk?

595
00:19:26,473 --> 00:19:28,300
It's not very Munkensmat.

596
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:30,302
- They're study materials
for the lieutenant's exam.

597
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:31,434
You can't give up.

598
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:32,435
You're gonna take
the exam again,

599
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,567
you're gonna ace it,

600
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,264
and then
you're gonna wear these.

601
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,526
- My lieutenant suspenders.

602
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,049
You fished them out
of the trash.

603
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,138
- No, they were covered
in precinct goo,

604
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:41,357
but I got you a new pair,

605
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,750
leather yoke and all.
- Aw.

606
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,360
- Some things
are worth clinging to.

607
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:45,361
I was wrong.

608
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:46,580
Or Niles Bunkampf,

609
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:48,669
the inventor of Munkensmat,
was wrong.

610
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:51,149
- Yeah, that guy's an idiot.
- Was an idiot.

611
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:53,456
He got rid of all his objects,
including his clothes,

612
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,675
and froze to death
in a snowdrift.

613
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:56,154
- Why didn't you tell us that

614
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:57,591
before we burned
all our treasures?

615
00:19:57,634 --> 00:19:59,462
Eight framed photos of my dad,
up in flames.

616
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:01,029
- So does this mean
we can start

617
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:02,334
keeping personal objects
in the office again?

618
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:04,467
- Yes, on one condition.

619
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:06,556
No one tells Bruce
from "Organizers Quarterly."

620
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,167
- I'm definitely not gonna
reach out to Bruce.

621
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,995
- Oh, thank you.

622
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,388
You're a good friend.

623
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,653
- Ah, good morning,
Captain Holt.

624
00:20:16,697 --> 00:20:18,220
You're looking refreshed.

625
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:20,178
- Interesting.
I didn't sleep a wink.

626
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:23,268
Let's just say Kevin no longer
has me in the guest room.

627
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:26,663
- Nice. My two dads,
straight smashin' it.

628
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:29,231
Sorry, that came out weird.
Title of your sex tape.

629
00:20:29,274 --> 00:20:31,189
But more importantly, how did
it go with Commissioner Kelly?

630
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:32,756
- I gave him a list
of my demands,

631
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,193
and he's agreed to back off
of vigilant policing.

632
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:37,152
- Whoa, that's amazing.
- But that's not all.

633
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:39,023
I also got something
for the precinct.

634
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:40,808
- Is it a fighter jet?
How did you get a fighter jet?

635
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:42,331
We don't have the budget
for that.

636
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,680
- It's not a fighter jet.
- Aw.

637
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:45,769
- I got him to reopen
the first floor.

638
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,513
It's back to normal.

639
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:51,819
It's beautiful.

640
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,342
Thank you, sir.

641
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,170
- I couldn't have done it
without you.

642
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,693
As a matter of fact, I'd like
to take you out tonight

643
00:20:56,737 --> 00:20:57,694
for a thank-you dinner.

644
00:20:57,738 --> 00:20:59,261
- Oh, I would love that,

645
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:00,697
but I'm gonna have to take
a rain check,

646
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:02,307
'cause Amy and I
already have plans.

647
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:05,049
Although I'm pretty sure
you would approve.

648
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:07,138
So this is a brine barrel.

649
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,618
It's made by Josiah Wooldruff,

650
00:21:08,662 --> 00:21:11,795
who learned the craft from
his father Jesiah Wooldruff,

651
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,449
who in turn learned—
you know what?

652
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:14,624
This was a terrible idea.
I'm sorry.

653
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:16,452
- Don't you dare stop.
- Oh.

654
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:17,627
Okay.

655
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:20,238
Josiah's cousin Joshua
was a cooper,

656
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:21,370
not a hooper.

657
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,719
- Oh, mama.

658
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:24,721
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

659
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:26,810
- Fremulon.
