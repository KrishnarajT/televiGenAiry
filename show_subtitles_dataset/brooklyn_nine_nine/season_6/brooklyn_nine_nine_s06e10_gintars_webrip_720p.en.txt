1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,453
I come for Charles Boyle.
- Hey, hey, hey!

2
00:00:03,487 --> 00:00:05,189
Hands where we can see them.
- Chill out, bro!

3
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:08,025
It's not gun.
It's just—uh, it's a toy.

4
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:09,326
No shoot, pretty please.

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,228
It's gift for Nikolaj.

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,297
- Nikolaj?
How do you know Charles' son?

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,464
- My name is Gintars.

8
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:16,300
From Latvia.

9
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,035
I am Nikolaj birth father.

10
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:20,037
- Ohh!

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,139
Nikolaj's birth father
who I'd never hope to meet.

12
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:23,573
Very cool.

13
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,575
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool, cool,

14
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,445
cool, cool, cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, c-c-c-c-c—

15
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:50,434
- Charles, are you okay?
You hit your head pretty hard.

16
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,069
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

17
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:53,070
I don't have a concussion.

18
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,271
- We'll see about that.

19
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,106
How many musical numbers are
there in the movie "Zootopia"?

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,108
- Oh, just the one.
- Yeah, he's okay.

21
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,476
- I don't know
what's going on.

22
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:01,145
How did you find me?

23
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:02,379
The orphanage isn't supposed to
give out that information.

24
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:05,215
- You know Dragomir,
Nikolaj brother?

25
00:01:05,249 --> 00:01:06,316
He tell me all about you.

26
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:08,452
- Of course. You're Dragomir's
father too.

27
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,054
- No, Dragomir is my brother.

28
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:12,489
Dragomir and I have same father
but different mother.

29
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:13,557
Her name Anyuta.

30
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:15,525
Together we have baby.
That baby's Nikolaj.

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,227
Dragomir is brother of Nikolaj.

32
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:19,263
I am brother of Dragomir.
Also stepfather.

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,131
We are contemporary blended
family.

34
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,133
Would make very good TV show.

35
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:25,202
- Honestly, that does sound
very interesting and good.

36
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:27,404
- Anyways, I was too young and
poor to have child,

37
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,507
but now I'm very successful
businessman.

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,610
I have my own clothing line.
Maybe you've heard of it:

39
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:35,011
The Gape.

40
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:36,546
We also have Baby Gape
and the Gape Body.

41
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,282
- Oh, you mean The Gap?
- No, no, Gape.

42
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,252
Like, there are two things
and there's space between.

43
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:43,353
- Yeah, like, The Gap.
Like, The Gap.

44
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:44,654
The company that already
exists.

45
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,655
- I don't know what you're
saying.

46
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,257
I never heard of it.

47
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,094
But is it a knock-off of Gape?
Do they sell clothing?

48
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,161
- So what? You have money now,

49
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:52,396
and you're just gonna take
Nikolaj back?

50
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:54,364
- No, no, I don't want to take
boy from you.

51
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:55,865
I just want to meet him one
time.

52
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,102
Look, I know it's lot to ask,

53
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,604
but, please.
Nikolaj is my sex result.

54
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,572
- Oh, yeah? Well,
I walk your sex result

55
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:03,573
to school every
morning.

56
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,142
- No, don't use his words.

57
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:06,343
- I help your sex result with
his homework.

58
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,477
- This is bad, even for you.

59
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,346
- I sing your sex result a
lullaby every night.

60
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,416
- I wanna do something.
- You will never meet my son.

61
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,583
- Oh, yeah? Well, then I don't
leave America until

62
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,553
I meet the boy.
And I come from white country.

63
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,422
I have very long visa.

64
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:20,424
Very long.

65
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:23,160
- So I'm positive the murder
happened inside this apartment,

66
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,361
but CSI could find no traces
of blood.

67
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,696
I'd like to ask the FBI to
bring in a team of lab techs.

68
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,498
- This would require
Commissioner Kelly signing off.

69
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:31,268
Before I make that ask, is
there anything else we can do?

70
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:33,637
- Um, I'm pretty sure there is.

71
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,272
Are you thinking what I'm
thinking?

72
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:36,306
- I am now.

73
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,641
both: We need Yee!

74
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:38,808
- Who?

75
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:40,577
- Isn't it that guy that led
that seminar where you guys

76
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,478
turned Boyle into a mummy,

77
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,113
and then you pushed him down
the stairs?

78
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:44,214
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Rosa.

79
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:47,117
Easy. No one pushed Boyle down
the stairs.

80
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,452
- Right. We may have
plastered his eyes shut

81
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:49,719
and left him
to wander around blindly,

82
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,289
but he fell down on his own.

83
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:53,590
It was a classic accident.
- Exactly.

84
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,592
Anyway, Dr. Yee is a genius

85
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,427
in the field of forensic
entomology.

86
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:00,664
They call him "Father Fly."

87
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,466
How cool is that?
- 0%.

88
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,134
How are insects gonna help us?

89
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,402
There weren't any in or around
the boy.

90
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,736
- Oh, my God.

91
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,207
You still think forensic
entomology is all blow flies

92
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,376
and screw worms, don't you?

93
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,258
- That's a good one, Santiago.

94
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,393
You should take the
Lieutenant's exam.

95
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:31,328
- Hey.
- Dr. Yee has recently

96
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,163
bred a species of fly

97
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:34,264
that has increased
sensitivities to certain

98
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,199
human proteins.

99
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:37,634
- They can detect trace amounts
of blood,

100
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,369
even if it's been cleaned
with bleach.

101
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:41,271
- Or masked with animal urine.

102
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,539
- Oh, I was building to that.

103
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,508
Thanks for stealing my thunder.
- This is nasty.

104
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,643
Terry hates bugs.
Too many eyes and legs.

105
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,345
- Would you still hate bugs
if I told you that

106
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:50,480
there were thousands of tiny
mites that live

107
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,582
in your eyebrows and keep them
from being weighed down

108
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:54,784
by oils?
- Yes!

109
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,253
- Look, I really think we
should go

110
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:57,554
with the feds on
this.

111
00:03:58,788 --> 00:03:59,423
- No, we're bringing in Yee.
I'll make the call right now.

112
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:00,657
- Oh, can I listen on speaker?
- Mm.

113
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,691
- Oh, my God.

114
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:03,293
It's gonna be a long couple
of days.

115
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,662
- You're telling me.
I got bugs in my brows, Rosa.

116
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:07,297
- Hey.

117
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,266
So what's your plan
with Gintars?

118
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:10,600
He's kind of taking over
the whole waiting area.

119
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,801
- No, don't worry about me.

120
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,204
I'm watching "Mad About You"
on Latvian Hulu.

121
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:15,472
It's very funny show.

122
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,806
Very many episodes.

123
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,443
I could sit here all day.

124
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,644
- I don't know what to do.

125
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,778
He's never gonna leave.

126
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:22,846
But I'm scared for Nikolaj
to get to know him.

127
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,314
- Okay, how about this?

128
00:04:25,114 --> 00:04:25,415
Gintars just wants
to see him, right?

129
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:26,716
We can maybe have them meet

130
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,785
without telling Nikolaj that
Gintars is his birth father.

131
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:30,587
Just say he's an old friend
of ours.

132
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:31,521
- Jake, you're completely
forgetting about

133
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,290
the olfactory bond.

134
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:35,559
Nikolaj will immediately
recognize his father's scent.

135
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:36,560
- Well, you got to do
something,

136
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:38,428
and I don't think you're gonna
wait this guy out.

137
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,398
Paul and Jamie are locked in
the bathroom.

138
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:43,567
But Jamie has a turkey
in the oven.

139
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,734
This is a very good setup.

140
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,536
- And they pay it off.
- It's so good.

141
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,637
- Okay, Jake,

142
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,639
let's give your plan a shot.

143
00:04:49,673 --> 00:04:51,541
- Okay, Gintars,
remember the deal is,

144
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:53,343
you cannot tell Nikolaj
you're his father.

145
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,411
- Who Gintars?

146
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:55,445
I'm Billy Hanukkah.

147
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,314
I'm from the Bronx, Manhattan.

148
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,316
I eat pizza at Famous Ray's.

149
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,650
- Okay, well, no need
to get too specific

150
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:02,286
or offer up any
backstory.

151
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,520
Hey, guys.
I'm just coming from work

152
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,754
with my friend
Billy Hanukkah.

153
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:06,656
- Hanukkah.
- It's fine.

154
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,757
Kids don't know
which names are weird.

155
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:09,459
- Nikolaj, say hi to Jake
and this stranger.

156
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,828
- Hi, Jake. I love you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hanukkah.

157
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:12,829
I love you too.

158
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:13,730
- Man, he really is a Boyle,
isn't he?

159
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:15,332
- Hello, my little friend.

160
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:16,600
Did you have good day at
school?

161
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,835
- We had computer class today.
- I am your real father!

162
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,337
My name is Gintars.

163
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,571
You are my son.
- What?

164
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:22,606
- Well.

165
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,840
That backfired real quick.

166
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:29,413
- Daddy, why is the man saying
he's my father?

167
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:31,748
- Mr. Hanukkah's crazy. He has
no children of his own,

168
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,683
and it's driven him mad.

169
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:34,851
I'm your father, Nikolaj.

170
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,019
- It's pronounced Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

171
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:37,020
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

172
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,021
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

173
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:39,022
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

174
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:40,290
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.

175
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:41,257
- It's okay. You say it wrong.

176
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,726
- Okay, well, that was fun.

177
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,028
Hey, why don't you go play over
there, buddy?

178
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:47,764
You can take this
drug store receipt.

179
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:49,333
It's very long and filled
with coupons.

180
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:50,500
You can fly it around
like a kite.

181
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,969
- Whee!

182
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:55,004
- Wow, kids are really basic.
Is being a dad super easy?

183
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:56,039
- What the hell was that?

184
00:05:56,072 --> 00:05:57,774
You promised you
wouldn't tell him.

185
00:05:59,008 --> 00:05:59,676
- So sorry. I smelled my boy.
I don't know what came over me.

186
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:01,745
Please. I'm in town
for 10 more days.

187
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,381
Let Nikolaj know I exist.
Let me spend time with him.

188
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,316
I could take him
to Russian bathhouse.

189
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,451
Has he been?
- No!

190
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:08,952
I'm not some weirdo that takes
my eight-year-old

191
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:10,454
to the Russian bath!

192
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,423
We take our baths at home
together as a family

193
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,325
like normal people!

194
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:17,894
- Not sure you have the upper
hand on that storm-off, Boyle.

195
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,464
- He's here!
Dr. Yee's on his way up.

196
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,998
How's my breath?

197
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,067
- Perfect.
Yee's gonna love it.

198
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,068
- This is not a good color on
you guys.

199
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:26,102
Speaking of bad looks,

200
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,071
Sarge, what is going on
with your eyebrows, man?

201
00:06:28,104 --> 00:06:29,506
- I shaved them off.

202
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:30,974
'Cause of the bugs.

203
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,409
Sharon said you couldn't
notice.

204
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:33,577
- Sharon lied, Terry. You look
like a straight-up fool.

205
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,811
- Damn, Rosa.

206
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:36,780
- No, Diaz is right.

207
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,415
Your face is horrifying.

208
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:41,551
You should leave before—
Hello, Dr. Yee!

209
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:42,752
Out back now.

210
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:43,753
- Captain Holt,

211
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:44,821
nice to see you again.

212
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:45,855
- Please, call me Raymond.

213
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,057
Unless that feels weird.
You don't have to.

214
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:49,058
I'll answer to anything.

215
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,827
- Raymond works.

216
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,929
So I understand you have a
potential crime scene,

217
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:53,963
and you'd like to find some
blood.

218
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:55,999
Well, I've brought along
several hundred

219
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,502
of my best detectives
to help out.

220
00:06:58,535 --> 00:07:01,037
- Oh, my God.
I'm starstruck.

221
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,539
- We all are.

222
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:04,441
So what you made you think of
using drosophila

223
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:05,475
as a method of searching for
blood traces?

224
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,010
- Have you ever read Sung
Ts'u's textbook

225
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:08,545
"The Washing Away of Wrongs"
from 1235?

226
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:09,546
- Nope.
- Yes.

227
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:10,880
- Which edition?

228
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:12,348
- It tells the story of the
first known use

229
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:13,483
of forensic entomology.

230
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:14,951
A farmer was slashed to death.

231
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:15,885
A local judge asked everyone in
the town

232
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,286
to lay down their sickles.

233
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:19,055
And though they all appeared
clean,

234
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,591
one attracted a horde of flies.

235
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,592
The insects could sense
the blood,

236
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:25,161
even though it was invisible
to the human eye.

237
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,162
- Wow, what an arresting story.

238
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,864
- Yes, they did arrest him.

239
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,502
- We made a joke together.

240
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:37,874
- Okay, Dr. Yee, how effective
is your box of bugs?

241
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:39,008
- Oh, well, in a lab,

242
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,477
they've detected blood even

243
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,277
when it's been cleaned
with bleach.

244
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:42,912
both: Or covered with animal
urine!

245
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,113
- You two really know your
stuff.

246
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,021
- I know that sound.

247
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:54,424
That's the moaning of a man
who left his lunch on the bus.

248
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:56,025
- I didn't lose my lunch,
you idiot.

249
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,427
I lost my son!

250
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:59,062
- Okay, Scully, I got this.

251
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,897
Hey there, bud.

252
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,165
I got you your favorite tea:

253
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,067
duck broth.
- Thanks.

254
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,835
You know me so well.

255
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,504
But I'm too sad
to drink duck broth.

256
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,540
- Wow, I never thought I'd hear
you or anyone say that.

257
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,443
- Nikolaj is asking if Gintars
is really his dad.

258
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:16,212
I worked so hard to have him
think of me as his father.

259
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,581
And now it's all ruined.

260
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:19,616
He'll probably go back to
calling me what he did

261
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:21,818
when I first adopted him:
Mr. America.

262
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:23,553
- I know you're upset,
but that is a dope nickname.

263
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,588
- I'm not Mr. America.

264
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:26,155
I'm Daddy.
- Of course you are.

265
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,526
- I just don't want
Nikolaj to see him again.

266
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,528
I don't want him turning
into a Gintars.

267
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,529
- You have nothing
to worry about.

268
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,631
Nikolaj is already
a mini Charles.

269
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:35,999
He's an eight-year-old boy
whose favorite movie

270
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:37,433
is "Bullets Over Broadway."

271
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:38,602
- So what are you saying?
I should let him spend time

272
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,069
with Gintars?

273
00:08:40,904 --> 00:08:41,170
- I just worry that
if you prevent him

274
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:42,472
from knowing his birth father,

275
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:43,840
that he'll build up some
fantasy of him

276
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:45,141
and then blame you
for keeping them apart.

277
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,442
- That's crazy.

278
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:47,944
- The way that King Trident
kept Ariel

279
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:49,112
from exploring the
surface.

280
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,547
- Oh, my God, you're right.

281
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,882
I'm driving Nikolaj into the
arms of a sea witch.

282
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,018
- Watching him work is amazing.

283
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,119
- Mm-hmm.

284
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:58,955
- I have to get a video.
- Santiago, please.

285
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:00,156
Hold the phone horizontal

286
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:01,958
to get more flies in frame.

287
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:04,561
- All right, guys, this fanboy
stuff is a little much.

288
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,162
- The only thing that's a
little much over here

289
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:08,532
are your scrawled-on eyebrows.

290
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:09,699
Yeesh.
- Seriously?

291
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,134
I thought they worked.
- They do...

292
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,502
if you wanna look
like a mean drag queen.

293
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,137
- I knew I should have done
a flatter arch.

294
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,505
This is a nighttime look.

295
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,907
- Well, the flies
are not reacting.

296
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:19,576
I can keep going,
but I'll tell you now,

297
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:22,512
it's very unlikely there are
any traces of blood in here.

298
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:23,913
- Well, according
to my timeline,

299
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:25,081
this is the only place the
murder could have happened.

300
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,584
- Sorry, Rosa, looks like
your timeline's wrong.

301
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,285
Because the flies don't lie.

302
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,687
You can use that if you want.

303
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,188
- He's not gonna use
a cheeky slogan.

304
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,590
He's a man of science.

305
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:34,624
- I like it.

306
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,192
The flies don't lie.

307
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:39,262
- Okay, Dr. Yee, exactly how
accurate is this technology?

308
00:09:39,295 --> 00:09:41,631
- Diaz, how dare you
question the man.

309
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,167
Dr. Yee has spent millions
of dollars developing

310
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,935
and researching these flies.

311
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:48,104
- It's fine. Would you all like
to see what happens

312
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,272
when they actually sense blood?

313
00:09:49,305 --> 00:09:50,273
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

314
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,507
- Will you hold this, Ally?

315
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,548
- Wow.
- I'm sorry, Detective Diaz,

316
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:00,950
I know it's upsetting when a
hunch doesn't pan out.

317
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:04,187
- Well, it's over.
The flies have it.

318
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,090
Keep your eyes on the flies.

319
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:08,758
Flies don't lie.

320
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,259
Now, that's a good one.

321
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:13,062
Oh, no, it's Santiago's.
Damn it.

322
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,664
- Wow, this was a bad idea.

323
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,766
- Relax. He gets one
afternoon with Nikolaj,

324
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,034
and he chooses basketball?

325
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,703
Does Nikolaj even like
basketball?

326
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,170
- He loves the "Get Your Head
In The Game" number

327
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,238
from "High School Musical."

328
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,173
- I haven't seen it, but I know
that's not the same.

329
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,309
Look at them. Does it seem like
he's actually enjoying this?

330
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:28,144
- Porzingas!

331
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:29,145
- Charles, can I tell you a
story?

332
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:31,014
- Always.
- All right.

333
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,148
When I was 10,

334
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,183
my dad started dating
this woman, Leeza.

335
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,985
My mom hated her.

336
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:37,253
But my dad wanted us to bond,

337
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,789
so one day he took me and Leeza
to the mall and dropped us off.

338
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:42,626
She proceeds to steal a ton
of blouses from Ann Taylor

339
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,293
and then immediately makes
me go back in

340
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,029
and exchange them
for store credit.

341
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,163
Then to celebrate,

342
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:48,331
I get to pull Leeza's
Cinnabon apart

343
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:51,134
because her nails are too long
and curly to do it herself.

344
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:52,636
- Ugh.
- Point being,

345
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,070
nothing has ever made me love
my own mother

346
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:56,773
more than the time I spent
with Leeza.

347
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:58,341
Gintars is Leeza.

348
00:10:58,374 --> 00:10:59,776
You are my mom.

349
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,210
- I can't believe I get
to be Karen.

350
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,311
What an honor!

351
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,080
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Yes, sweetie?

352
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:07,183
- Can we leave?
- Oh, no, so soon?

353
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,352
But I understand.
We can go home right now.

354
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:12,689
- No, not home. Daddy Gintars
wants to buy me a jean jacket

355
00:11:12,722 --> 00:11:14,357
just like his.

356
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,192
- Daddy Gintars.

357
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:18,027
- Daddy Gintars.

358
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,362
- Oh, no.

359
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,397
I am Leeza.

360
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,598
Wait. No. That's not right.

361
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:29,806
- Hey, bud.

362
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:31,374
Everything going okay in here?

363
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:32,876
I know you're going through
something,

364
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:34,077
but people are starting to
complain about the moaning.

365
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,413
- Ugh. I would give anything
to have Gintars gone

366
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,415
and out of Nikolaj's life.

367
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,950
But it's not gonna happen.

368
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,019
- Okay, well, I'm just gonna
close the door, then.

369
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,154
And you can feel free to moan
as much as you need.

370
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:48,892
This is bad.

371
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,894
- I know. He's been
like that all day.

372
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:51,895
- No, I was talking
about your eyebrows.

373
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:53,897
Whatever's going on up
there is real, real bad.

374
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,033
- Well, it's better than having
two bug hotels above your eyes.

375
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:59,368
- But wouldn't they also be
in your goatee?

376
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:00,436
- Don't do this to me, Jake.

377
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,570
- Wait a minute.

378
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,139
I may have just thought of
a way to get rid of Gintars.

379
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:04,340
Do you still have that friend

380
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:05,374
who works on the
Counterfeiting Taskforce?

381
00:12:05,742 --> 00:12:06,943
- Yeah, why?

382
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:08,077
- Gintars has this terrible
knock-off clothing brand

383
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:09,679
called The Gape.

384
00:12:10,747 --> 00:12:10,780
If I can get him to admit on
tape that he's selling

385
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:12,682
counterfeit goods,
they would terminate his visa

386
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:14,150
and deport him.
- Deport him?

387
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:15,719
Doesn't that seem
a little extreme?

388
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:16,986
- Yeah, definitely,
but Charles just said

389
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:18,922
he'd give anything
for Gintars to be gone.

390
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,057
- He's not doing great, Terry.

391
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,091
- Okay.

392
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,426
But how are you gonna get
Gintars on tape?

393
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:24,861
- Good question,
Sergeant Crazy Brows.

394
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:26,830
Gintars is always talking about
the Russian baths.

395
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:27,997
I'll see if he'll meet me
there

396
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,665
and then ask him to cut me in
on his business.

397
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,801
Meanwhile, I'll have a mic
hidden underneath my towel.

398
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:32,802
It's foolproof.

399
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,903
- Before we do deal,

400
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:34,938
we take off towel.

401
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,173
It's full naked.

402
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:38,474
- Ha.

403
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,843
- What are you waiting for?

404
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,410
I want to see where your hair
starts and stops.

405
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:43,479
- Gintars.

406
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,481
- Take it off now.

407
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,983
- Heh.

408
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,084
- Hey, Sarge.

409
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:49,953
Holy crap.
What the hell is that?

410
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,421
- That is a bug-free zone
is what it is.

411
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:53,456
I bleached it.

412
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:54,858
I'm smarter than they are,
Rosa.

413
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:55,725
- Uh-huh.
What about your nose hair?

414
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,062
- Oh, man. Terry forgot
about his nose.

415
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:01,030
- Hey, why is Yee still here?

416
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:03,466
- Holt wants him to hand in his
case report in person.

417
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:04,500
I think he's trying
to trick him

418
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,835
into going to lunch
with him.

419
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,236
- Wait. It's noon?

420
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,806
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that was lunchtime.

421
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,507
- I hope they take that
container of bugs with them

422
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,042
when they go.
- Wait. The container's here?

423
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:14,110
I have an idea.

424
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,745
All I need is some blood.

425
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:16,880
- This is fresh.

426
00:13:16,913 --> 00:13:18,181
- Oh. Terrible, yet perfect.

427
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:25,855
Stupid bugs didn't do anything.

428
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,223
He lied to us, Sarge.,

429
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,026
- Huh?

430
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,027
- Why's your towel still on?

431
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,762
This is business conversation.

432
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,998
You cannot trust a man who
cannot show you his full self.

433
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,532
- Well, not in America.

434
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,902
Here we have business meetings
fully clothed.

435
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:40,136
Sometimes even in a suit
and tie.

436
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,270
Have you ever seen the show
"Shark Tank"?

437
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:43,773
- Latvian "Shark Tank"
is all nude.

438
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,041
- That sounds weirdly sexy.

439
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,042
- No, not at all.

440
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,877
There's no female sharks,

441
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:50,546
so it's just four
Mr. Wonderfuls naked

442
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,115
on a big leather couch.

443
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,983
- Huh. Not what I imagined.

444
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,885
Hey, listen.

445
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,021
I would love to buy some of
that knock-off denim.

446
00:13:58,054 --> 00:13:59,522
- Okay, first of all,
it's not knock-off.

447
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:01,524
Okay, Gape is true,
authentic brand.

448
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:03,793
The real thief is Gap.

449
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:04,828
- Are they?
- What makes more sense?

450
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,296
That they take Gape
and remove letter?

451
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:11,167
Or that I take Gap
and add pricey E?

452
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,201
- I don't care if it's fake,

453
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:13,469
I just wanna buy some.

454
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,205
- It's not fake;
you are still wearing a towel;

455
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,241
and this deal: over.

456
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,176
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

457
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,212
Do you wanna know why
I won't take off my towel?

458
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:24,313
It's because I'm embarrassed...

459
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:27,183
about what's underneath.

460
00:14:27,216 --> 00:14:28,217
- Mutilated penis?

461
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:30,019
- Ye... p.

462
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,055
That is it. You guessed it
on the first try.

463
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,858
That's what's under there.
The old—the old...

464
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:35,825
mute peen.

465
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:37,293
- I am so sorry
about your penis.

466
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:38,828
- It's a bummer.

467
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:41,865
- But we all have things
that bring us shame.

468
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,066
Remember when I told you before

469
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,068
that Gape was original,
authentic brand?

470
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,302
- I do. It was just now.

471
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,171
- Yeah, well...

472
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,939
I stole the whole thing
from Gap.

473
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,341
- And here I was
completely believing you

474
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:53,843
when you told me you didn't.

475
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,078
Wow.

476
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:56,913
Well, thank you for sharing
that with me.

477
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:58,281
- You are freak.

478
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,616
But I support you.
Come.

479
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,952
- Oh, no, it's a naked hug.

480
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,021
Ha ha.
Ah.

481
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,223
- Hey, what's up?

482
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,324
You guys having a little
coffee? That's cool.

483
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:09,325
Yee's a fraud.
- What?

484
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:10,593
- Excuse me?

485
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:12,228
- Those nasty-ass bugs
don't smell blood.

486
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,197
And they must not smell
bullcrap, either,

487
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,298
'cause he's spewing it
everywhere.

488
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,167
- What are you saying out
of your weird face?

489
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,302
- We put the flies
near fresh blood,

490
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,270
and nothing happened.
They didn't react at all.

491
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,941
- Do you know how stupid
these accusations sound?

492
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:26,175
Diaz, you're fired.
- What?

493
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,278
- Dr. Yee is one of the most
respected forensic experts

494
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:30,346
in the country.

495
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,548
- For you two—
let's not mince words—

496
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,920
common fools to suggest
that you found the flaw

497
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:37,987
in this brilliant man's—
- They're right.

498
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,022
- What?
- Huh?

499
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:41,991
- The flies don't sense blood.

500
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,626
They're just regular flies.

501
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,128
- But, Dr. Yee, you can't
be a fraud.

502
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,429
You gave a TED Talk.

503
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:49,132
- I spent $6 million in federal
grant money on this experiment

504
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,299
and I've gotten nowhere.

505
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:51,867
The closest I ever came was
when they all landed

506
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,970
on a popsicle once.

507
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,039
- But in the apartment we saw
them react to a cotton swab

508
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,240
dipped in blood.
- It was melted popsicle.

509
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,742
- Jam works, too,
but it's more expensive.

510
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:02,411
- So, Sir, you were saying
something about us being

511
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:03,612
common fools?

512
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:05,148
- So who looks stupid now?

513
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,150
- Uh, Terry, your
left eyebrow is missing.

514
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:09,018
- Oh, I must have
rubbed it off.

515
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,120
There it is.

516
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:12,355
Who looks stupid now?

517
00:16:14,323 --> 00:16:16,659
- Jake, hey, I got it, man.

518
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,327
Nice jeans,
and the good thing is

519
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:21,164
look—both legs, same length.

520
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:22,431
- Thank you very much.

521
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:23,967
And I see it's 100% denim-ish.

522
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:25,668
"Caution: Do not wear near
women who are pregnant

523
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:27,036
or breast-feeding."
- This is true.

524
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:28,371
The nipple may fall off.

525
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,040
- Hey, guys.
Gintars said to meet him here.

526
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,075
I didn't realize
you were coming.

527
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:33,409
- My man, I'ma wrestle you.
Come here.

528
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:34,944
- Charles, what are you
doing here?

529
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:36,112
Why is Nikolaj here?

530
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:37,680
- Oh, he's been so happy
since he met Gintars.

531
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:39,215
I've been focusing on myself

532
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:40,149
and not really thinking
about Nikolaj.

533
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:41,650
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't realize how much

534
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:44,087
it meant to him to know he
hadn't been abandoned.

535
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:45,088
I'm okay with them having
a relationship.

536
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:47,223
- Wow, that is so great
of you, Charles,

537
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:48,357
but I really wish you'd
included me in

538
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:49,358
your decision-making process.

539
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:50,659
- Why?
- No reason.

540
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:51,460
I just maybe went
in a different,

541
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:52,661
less-mature
direction.

542
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:55,264
Hey, maybe we should leave
this area, like, right now.

543
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:56,399
- Cop car.
How's it going?

544
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:57,633
Hey, man.

545
00:16:58,501 --> 00:16:59,102
- Gintars Irbe,
you're under arrest

546
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:00,236
for selling counterfeit goods.

547
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:01,437
- Jake! You set me up.

548
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:03,306
Do you even have
mutilated penis?

549
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:07,143
No.

550
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:09,979
It's perfect.

551
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:14,650
- Okay.

552
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:15,618
So they're taking Gintars
to the airport

553
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,286
and they're not hurting him...

554
00:17:18,354 --> 00:17:19,055
any more than they did when
he was resisting arrest.

555
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:22,391
- Now they won't let him go
just because I asked them to

556
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:23,626
even though they arrested him
just because I asked them to.

557
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:25,461
It's a crazy system.
I don't understand it.

558
00:17:26,162 --> 00:17:26,996
But here's what I'm thinking:

559
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:28,564
I call the State Department—
- You've done enough, Jake.

560
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:30,066
- That's nice of you
to say, but—

561
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,467
- My tone wasn't nice.
- But your tone is always nice

562
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,735
with me.

563
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:34,070
Wait a minute.
Are you mad?

564
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,338
- Yes, because you butted
into a situation

565
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:36,405
you shouldn't have.

566
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:37,373
You need to keep your butt
in your pants.

567
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:39,275
- My butt was only out
because you said

568
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:40,409
you wanted Gintars gone.

569
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:41,510
- Well, thanks to your butt,

570
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:42,445
Nikolaj feels like
he's been abandoned

571
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,047
all over again.

572
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:45,181
- Okay, but my butt was
the one that got them together

573
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:46,482
in the first place.

574
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:47,583
I don't feel like my butt is
getting credit for that.

575
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:48,384
- Well, that's because
your butt

576
00:17:49,052 --> 00:17:50,286
was inappropriate
then too.

577
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:51,387
Your butt should have never
been a part of this.

578
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:53,722
So now I gotta go clean up the
big nasty mess

579
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:54,723
that your butt made.

580
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:56,525
- But my butt no but—

581
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,726
My butt no but!

582
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,128
- Diaz, Jeffords,

583
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,330
Santiago would like to
apologize to you

584
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:02,298
for her
behavior.

585
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:03,166
- I thought we were both
apologizing.

586
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:04,467
- No, I misunderstood.

587
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:05,668
What would I be apologizing
for?

588
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:06,802
- The same thing as me?

589
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,471
- Really?

590
00:18:09,705 --> 00:18:09,738
- You guys maybe want to have
this conversation on your own?

591
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:10,573
- Yes.

592
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:12,241
Okay, we have come
to a decision

593
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:15,544
that we would both like
to apologize.

594
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:18,414
We should have trusted your
instincts over Dr. Yee

595
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:19,615
and his flies.

596
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:20,549
- And?

597
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:23,086
- And we shouldn't have been
so insulting.

598
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,387
- And?

599
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,754
- I'm not gonna apologize
for your face.

600
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,423
That mess is clearly on you.

601
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:28,757
- Fair enough.
- I'll ask Commissioner Kelly

602
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,427
to approve your initial request
for an FBI lab team.

603
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,162
- That won't be necessary.
I solved the case.

604
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,463
And the flies actually
came in handy.

605
00:18:34,497 --> 00:18:37,066
These have been genetically
engineered

606
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,435
to detect blood, and
there's a whole swarm of them

607
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:42,571
at your apartment right now
with Dr. Ronald Yee.

608
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:43,839
The flies don't lie.

609
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,708
He confessed immediately.
- How about that.

610
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:48,577
Dr. Yee and his flies
saved the day after all.

611
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:49,578
- No, I did.

612
00:18:49,612 --> 00:18:51,447
- Should we call Yee
and tell him the good news?

613
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:53,516
- It would probably
make him feel so much better.

614
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:55,684
- What is going on?
- He did seem so sad.

615
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,120
- So sad.
- He should be sad.

616
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,187
He's a fraud.

617
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,522
- Shh. It's ringing.

618
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,591
- Hey.

619
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,692
- Hey.

620
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,793
Did you make it to the airport
in time to see Gintars?

621
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:08,597
- Yes, but TSA wouldn't let him
stay in the country.

622
00:19:08,631 --> 00:19:10,533
At least Nikolaj got
to spend a few hours

623
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,468
with his birth father
at a Chili's Too.

624
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,403
- Chili's As Well.

625
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:17,740
Listen, I feel bad, and I
wanted to do something

626
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:18,741
but I know you didn't
want my help,

627
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,876
so long story short,

628
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,879
I made us these hats.

629
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,814
- I obviously love them.

630
00:19:25,848 --> 00:19:27,483
They don't change
how I'm feeling.

631
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:29,652
- Okay.

632
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:31,687
Well, I'm sorry that
I messed things up.

633
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,823
But I was just trying
to be a good friend.

634
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:37,226
- I know, but that doesn't
always mean fixing my life.

635
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,728
You shouldn't have done
anything without asking me.

636
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,864
Sometimes I just want you
to listen.

637
00:19:41,897 --> 00:19:43,632
- Right.

638
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,234
I hear that.

639
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,671
- It's just...
adoption is complicated.

640
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,206
No matter how much
I want to be,

641
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,674
I'm not Nikolaj's real father.

642
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,876
- Come on, Charles.
Of course you are.

643
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:55,778
- Well, that'll be up to him.

644
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:58,647
And he may even change his mind
about it throughout his life.

645
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:03,186
I mean, all I can do
is make him feel safe

646
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,154
and give him as much love
as I can.

647
00:20:05,188 --> 00:20:09,625
- Well, I think Nikolaj is very
lucky to have you.

648
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:11,860
- Nikolaj.

649
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,662
- Okay. Let's take these hats
out for a spin.

650
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:14,663
I've waited long enough.

651
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:15,798
Here you go.
Best Bud #1.

652
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:17,666
- You'd rather be Best Bud #2?

653
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,667
- I just want you to listen
a little more.

654
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:20,169
I don't wanna change
our whole dynamic.

655
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,171
- Okay, good, 'cause I really
wanted to be Best Bud #1.

656
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,607
- I know you did.
both: Clink!

657
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,841
- Oh, they're way too small.
- Ooh, they're tight.

658
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:26,875
- They're way too small.
- Hurt.

659
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:29,578
- They don't fit.
- Not a doctor. Shh.

660
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:31,580
- Fremulon.
