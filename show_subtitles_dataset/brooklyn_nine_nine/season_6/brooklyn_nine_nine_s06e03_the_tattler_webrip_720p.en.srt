1
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:06,135
- Attention, squad.

2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,528
Put your hands together

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:10,444
for the long-anticipated
reunion of...

4
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,360
- The DDC!

5
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:14,361
- DD...
- C!

6
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:15,362
- DD...
- C!

7
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:16,363
- Put a J with a G...

8
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:17,408
- You get DD...

9
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,366
both: C!

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,541
- Uh, the gas face.

11
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:21,716
- What the hell
is the DDC?

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,065
- I don't know, but I love it!

13
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:24,415
- The DDC is the Dope...

14
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,546
- Denim...
- Crew.

15
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,895
Our 20-year high school reunion

16
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,854
is tonight, and the party
is '90s-themed,

17
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:30,551
so we're dressing the way
we did back then,

18
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,597
AKA hella fresh.

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,686
- Can't wait to see everyone
we graduated with

20
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,557
and lie to them
about what I've been up to

21
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,080
for my own amusement.

22
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:41,257
It's gonna be Fib City,
population: Gina Clooney.

23
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:42,476
- But Jake, how can
you be excited

24
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,086
to return to your high school,

25
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,740
the scene of... Tattlegate?

26
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:47,133
- What's Tattlegate?
Why haven't I heard

27
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:49,222
anything about it?
- It was junior year

28
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:50,789
and Jake was riding high—

29
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:53,574
- Charles, no one wants
to hear this story...

30
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:54,575
from you.

31
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:55,576
It was junior year,

32
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,578
and Jake was riding high.

33
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:59,667
Sophomore year was rough,
but now I was back

34
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:02,278
with a hot new look:
an earring and long hair.

35
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:03,932
- Which was my look,
and he just copied it.

36
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:05,934
- And it worked!
I was finally cool,

37
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,545
and becoming friends
with the most popular kid

38
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:09,677
in school: Brandon Bliss.

39
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,549
- Dope name; sounds hot.
- He was hot, Rosa.

40
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:13,420
- For the record,
he could barely read.

41
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:14,943
- He didn't have to read, Gina.

42
00:01:14,987 --> 00:01:16,597
He lost his virginity
when he was 12 years old.

43
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:18,207
- Which is horrifying.

44
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:19,470
- But it wasn't back then!

45
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,733
Back then, it was...
everything.

46
00:01:21,776 --> 00:01:23,604
He asked me to ditch class
one day with him

47
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:24,953
and his buddies,
steal a school van,

48
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,564
and go get drunk
at his parents' cabin,

49
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,130
but the day before
we were supposed to go,

50
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:30,742
someone ratted Brandon out,
and he got suspended!

51
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:32,308
He thought I was the one
who told,

52
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:33,658
and from that day forward,

53
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,834
everyone called me
"The Tattler."

54
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:37,531
- Tattler.
It's a sexy nickname.

55
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:38,793
- It was not a sexy nickname!

56
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:40,316
It was a scarlet letter,

57
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,449
and it ruined my senior year,

58
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:45,147
but luckily,
I'm over all that now.

59
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:46,148
- Not me.
I'm gonna go

60
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:47,454
to this reunion tonight

61
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:48,977
and kick Brandon Bliss
in the butthole.

62
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,892
- Horrifying, but that won't
be necessary, Charles,

63
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:52,677
for my awesome life will do
the butthole-kicking this eve.

64
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,809
I've got a sweet job,
and a super-smart,

65
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,550
incredible wife.
Tonight's gonna be awesome.

66
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:57,725
Right, Gina?
- Damn straight!

67
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,205
- DD...
- C!

68
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:00,293
- DD...
- C!

69
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:01,294
- DD...
- C!

70
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,230
- Wow, this place
hasn't changed

71
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:25,927
one bit
in 20 years.

72
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:28,190
It's a real indictment
of the public school system.

73
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:29,670
- Jake!
Tina!

74
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,803
- No way!
Mikey J!

75
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:33,326
Amy, this is Mike Joseph,

76
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,938
AKA the lead funk bassist
from my legendary ska band,

77
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:40,159
Skalvester Skallone.
We had one song.

78
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,377
♪ Oh

79
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:44,424
all: ♪ Stop or my mom
will ska ♪

80
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:46,295
♪ Stop or my mom will ska

81
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:47,993
- Whoa!
- Hey, man.

82
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:49,472
We were so bad.
I can't believe

83
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:50,691
we thought
we were gonna make it.

84
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,432
So what have you been up to,
man?

85
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:54,695
- Well, I'm still trying to
get the music thing started.

86
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,262
- Oh, cool, cool, cool.
Never give up.

87
00:02:56,305 --> 00:02:58,699
- Anyway, how are you, Gina?
What have you been up to?

88
00:02:58,743 --> 00:03:00,571
- Nothing crazy.
Yeah, just writing

89
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,485
those "Thor" movies.
- Seriously?

90
00:03:02,529 --> 00:03:04,226
Oh, my God.
Tell me everything.

91
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,577
- Legally, I can't get into it
too much,

92
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,839
but just know that the next one

93
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:09,362
will have a lot more
full frontal.

94
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:12,234
- Well, if you need some ska
for your soundtrack...

95
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:13,496
- Oh!

96
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,585
This is them.
This is Marvel.

97
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,064
They probably want to talk

98
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,806
about "Thor 4: More Thor."
I gotta take this.

99
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,894
Okay?
- All right.

100
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,548
So how you doing, Jake?

101
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,377
I know the end of high school
was a little... rough.

102
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,987
- Oh, uh...

103
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,424
- Jake's killing it now.
He's a detective.

104
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:31,210
- Irie, mon!
Irie, irie!

105
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:32,385
Very nice.

106
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,517
God, you must have
some crazy stories.

107
00:03:34,561 --> 00:03:35,693
- Oh, I don't know.
I mean,

108
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:36,824
is successfully negotiating

109
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,304
a high-tension
hostage situation

110
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:39,914
in a bank crazy?

111
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:40,959
- Yes!

112
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,351
- Oh, well, then, I guess
I do have

113
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:44,092
some crazy stories, mon!

114
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:46,704
- Gosh, it's so cool

115
00:03:46,747 --> 00:03:48,227
how we all still dress
the same.

116
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,926
- Is it so much to ask?
You know what I'm saying?

117
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,624
- Why is everyone
gathered around the radio?

118
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,886
Ooh, are they testing

119
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:55,887
the emergency
broadcasting system?

120
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,410
- What?
No.

121
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:58,803
We're listening to a contest.

122
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,631
- This is 93.7,

123
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,023
The Jamhouse, with...

124
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,938
all: JC and the Horndog!

125
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,332
- FM radio...

126
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,464
- Yeah, the hosts
are beyond disgusting,

127
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:11,163
but they do a fun game
where they play a mystery sound

128
00:04:11,206 --> 00:04:13,034
and callers guess what it is
for a cash prize.

129
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:14,906
- Shh, they're about to play
the new sound!

130
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,997
- It's a crinkle.
I solved it.

131
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,302
- Yes, but you have to know
what object

132
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:21,695
is making the crinkle.

133
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:22,827
- But that's impossible.
It could be anything.

134
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,132
- Yes, sir.
That's the game.

135
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:25,351
- It's a bag of potato chips.

136
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:26,439
- Don't be an idiot!

137
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:27,788
It's a bag of corn chips.

138
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:29,137
- Well, this is
a total waste of time.

139
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:30,965
- Sure, but you can still
have fun,

140
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:32,750
even if you're wasting time.
- That's absurd.

141
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,708
Productivity is what
makes things fun.

142
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:37,319
That's why humans go to work.

143
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:38,581
- It is?

144
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,061
- Hey.
So you know

145
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,541
how Alicia and I broke up
because she moved to London,

146
00:04:41,584 --> 00:04:42,977
then we tried to make it work,

147
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:44,326
but the distance was too much
and we broke up again?

148
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,850
- No.
The last thing you told me

149
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:47,112
about yourself was that
you were bi.

150
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:48,504
- Well, a lot has happened
since then.

151
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:49,636
Anyway, I'm dating
two other people.

152
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,768
- So much juice at one time.

153
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:51,899
I'm drowning.

154
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:52,900
- Oh, gross.
Charles, this is why

155
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:53,988
I don't tell you anything.

156
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:55,511
- I take it back.
- Okay.

157
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:56,817
Well, it's early stages,
but they both tagged me

158
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,036
in a bunch of photos online,

159
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,428
and they found out
about each other.

160
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:00,865
- Yikes.
- Yeah, I know.

161
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,518
I shouldn't 'gram so much,
but my brunch friends say

162
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:03,911
it's the only way to promote
my handmade jewelry line.

163
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,173
- Brunch? What?

164
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:06,827
Homemade—who—
- Charles, focus.

165
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,089
Anyway, they're both annoyed,

166
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,569
and now I have to
choose one of them,

167
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,005
and I cannot make up my mind.

168
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,485
It's insane.
I never have trouble

169
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,008
making decisions.

170
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,749
- Ugh.
Choose the daughter.

171
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:17,316
I always know exactly
what to do,

172
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,274
but for the first time
in my life, I am stumped.

173
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,276
- Rosa, you've come
to the right man.

174
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,148
Boyles are genetically
indecisive beings.

175
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:24,976
- So I chose the worst
possible person to help me?

176
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,455
- No.
We've developed

177
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:28,196
a foolproof system to help us
make choices.

178
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,024
It used to take me so long
to decide what to wear

179
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,765
that I'd never change
my clothes.

180
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,375
Now look what I have on.

181
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,551
- Is this different than what
you were wearing yesterday?

182
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:36,770
- Barely.

183
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:38,859
- Wow, your life
sounds amazing.

184
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,469
I'm really happy
it worked out for you,

185
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:42,733
you know, especially with
the whole Tattler thing.

186
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,170
- What?
The Tattler? Wow.

187
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:46,780
I haven't heard that
in a long time.

188
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,129
Who even was the Tattler?

189
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,565
- You.
That's why I'm bringing it up.

190
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:50,871
- Oh, right, I remember now

191
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:52,177
that I was misidentified
as the Tattler.

192
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,744
That's so funny.
But I wasn't the Tattler,

193
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,049
so I'm pretty sure
you got this wrong.

194
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:56,790
- No, no, no, I think
I go—hey, Eric.

195
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,184
Didn't people call Jake
the Tattler?

196
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:00,228
- Oh, yeah!

197
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,405
Oh, good, more people
are getting involved.

198
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,930
- After my initial design,
they said it couldn't be done.

199
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,758
They said it was too tall,
too flashy—

200
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,455
building codes, bureaucracy.

201
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:12,588
Cut to the Freedom Tower
as you see it today.

202
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:13,764
- Wow.

203
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,809
- Thank you.
Yeah, I agree.

204
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,115
- Look, nobody cares
about that stuff.

205
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:18,594
We're all adults now.

206
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,640
You're a cop.
I work at a coffin factory.

207
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,903
I'm not sitting around,
thinking about how you tattled.

208
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:24,426
- Yes, we all have jobs
and work on coffins.

209
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,819
I didn't tattle, but whatevs.
We don't have to keep

210
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:26,820
talking about it.

211
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:29,431
all, successively: Great.

212
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:30,911
- But you were the Tattler,
right?

213
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,217
- Brandon Bliss was my friend!

214
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,827
Why would I tattle
on my friend?

215
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,829
The nickname was inaccurate,
is all I'm saying.

216
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:37,091
Anyways, as you can tell,

217
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,745
I am totally over it.

218
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,616
- Ah, man, it's the Tattler.

219
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,617
- I didn't tattle!

220
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:43,968
So...

221
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,970
I think I might not
be over it.

222
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,365
- Ugh, this is so unfair.

223
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,671
Everyone remembers me
as the Tattler,

224
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,194
but somehow, no one remembers

225
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:54,674
that Darren "Doo Doo" Donaldson

226
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:56,154
crapped himself during PE.

227
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:57,285
Look at him out there,

228
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,634
dancing on the dance floor

229
00:06:58,678 --> 00:07:00,375
like he's lived
a doo doo-free life.

230
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,899
- Jake, this isn't so bad.

231
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,944
History is full
of great tattlers.

232
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:06,207
Martin Luther King
tattled on racists.

233
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:07,382
- That's a pretty
undercutting way

234
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,688
of describing
his accomplishments.

235
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,385
- I was trying to help.
It felt bad.

236
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,778
- It's not even the nickname
that bothers me.

237
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,084
It's that I'm being
wrongfully accused.

238
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:14,868
I didn't tattle.
I mean, if it was the truth,

239
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,783
go ahead and call me
the Tattler all day long.

240
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,525
- Hey, Tattler.
- Not cool, Jason!

241
00:07:19,568 --> 00:07:21,005
Let's just go home.

242
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:22,571
- No!
We're not going anywhere.

243
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,747
You were wrongfully accused.
We're cops.

244
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,575
Let's just find
the real Tattler

245
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:27,881
and prove your innocence.

246
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:28,882
- Yes!
I love it!

247
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:29,752
Why learn to grow

248
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:31,406
when you can fix the past?

249
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,191
This is exactly why
I don't need therapy.

250
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,496
- Not sure that's the lesson

251
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,584
I want you to take away
from this.

252
00:07:35,628 --> 00:07:36,890
- Too late!
We're gonna prove

253
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,022
I wasn't the Tattler.
Therapy is a scam.

254
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,023
Let's do this.

255
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:41,068
- No.

256
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:42,896
The sound was more of a "khh."

257
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,419
- Ooh, how goes
the crinkle hunt?

258
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,291
I see you're not just
wasting time.

259
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:48,293
You're also wasting tin.

260
00:07:48,336 --> 00:07:50,556
- It was only one piece.

261
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,428
Okay, it was a ton of tin.

262
00:07:53,472 --> 00:07:54,777
- Pretty sure it's a guy
eating a sandwich.

263
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,170
I'll prove it to you.

264
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:57,955
- I'm not buying you
any more sandwiches, Scully.

265
00:07:57,998 --> 00:07:58,781
- I'm doing this for us!

266
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:00,479
- Guys, we can't fight.

267
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,046
That's what the Horndog wants.

268
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:03,395
- We're getting close.
We just need

269
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:04,613
to keep testing more things.

270
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:06,572
- Oh, that's a good idea.

271
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:10,010
Have you tried
a piece of paper?

272
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:11,011
Is that your crinkle?

273
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,752
Ooh, maybe—oh.

274
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:15,581
Maybe it's these bags
of coffee beans.

275
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:17,583
- All right, sir.
I think you've made your point.

276
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:19,324
- My point?
Oh, I'm just trying to have fun

277
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:20,803
by wasting time.

278
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,589
Oh, maybe it's this
crinkly-crunkly yogurt.

279
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,506
- Terry heard a crinkle.

280
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,986
- Holt heard a crinkle, too.

281
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:30,813
- So suddenly, it's not a waste
of time?

282
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:33,381
- Not a waste of time
if we win!

283
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,035
What are you waiting for,
Jeffords?

284
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:36,776
Call the Horndog!

285
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,386
- So then I said
to Steve,

286
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,475
"What if we drop the
'-lications,'

287
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,086
just call them 'apps'?"

288
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,957
- That's incredible.

289
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,916
Do you miss him?
- Oh, every day, Laura.

290
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,308
Every day.
- You should talk

291
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,831
to Quentin Chase.
He's a big-time

292
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,094
Silicon Valley investor now,

293
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,356
and he was just telling me
all about it.

294
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,487
Quentin, come here.

295
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,924
You have got to talk to Gina.

296
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,708
She basically invented apps.

297
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,449
They were going
to be called "lications."

298
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:58,667
- You really bungled that.

299
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,886
- What you been working on?

300
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,627
- Currently,
I have been working

301
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,977
on an app called Toddler.

302
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,284
It's like Tinder,
but for toddlers.

303
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:07,633
Tinder for toddlers.

304
00:09:07,676 --> 00:09:09,287
- I like it.
How are you gonna spell that?

305
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,462
How many D's?

306
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:12,464
- Five.

307
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:14,857
- All right, we should start
by talking to Brandon Bliss

308
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:16,816
and find out who told him
you were the Tattler.

309
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:18,296
- Unfortunately, Bliss
is not here.

310
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,907
Probably in the VIP section
at a Fatboy Slim concert.

311
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,822
- Would that be cool
for a 37-year-old?

312
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,476
- The funk soul brother
is timeless, Ames.

313
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,652
All right, I don't know
who told Brandon,

314
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:28,175
but I heard it was someone
on the football team.

315
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:30,090
- Okay, well, we need
more information than that,

316
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,049
so take me back to the day.
Spare no details.

317
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:33,354
- Okay, I saw Brandon

318
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:35,008
after second period,
and everything seemed tight.

319
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,836
- ♪ Hey now,
you're an all-star ♪

320
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,012
♪ Get your game on
go play ♪

321
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,796
- But then, when I saw him
after third period...

322
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,798
something had clearly changed.

323
00:09:42,842 --> 00:09:44,365
- ♪ Get paid

324
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,367
♪ All that glitters
is gold ♪

325
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,978
- After that, there was

326
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,631
little color left in the world
for young Jake.

327
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:53,287
My earring, less gold,
my JNCO jeans less purple.

328
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,159
- Are you sure
you were becoming cool?

329
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:56,203
- Yeah.
Why?

330
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,683
- I know how to solve this.

331
00:09:57,726 --> 00:09:58,945
We just have to find out
which football player

332
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,425
had third period
with Brandon Bliss.

333
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:01,730
We need his class schedule.

334
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:03,036
- Yeah, but where
are we gonna find that?

335
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,864
- In the coolest room
in the school.

336
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:08,868
- Good lord!

337
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:10,304
You coulda just picked
the lock.

338
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:11,523
- I know.
I'm sorry.

339
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:13,394
I'm just so amped up
about Admin.

340
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:16,528
- Okay, this is the Boyle
decision-making manual.

341
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:18,008
One of these sections
will help you

342
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,487
with choosing your partner.

343
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,706
Here we go.
What do you prefer,

344
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:22,316
eyes or butt,
brains or body?

345
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,709
- Brains.
- Uh...

346
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:24,884
Sorry, no, that's
for deciding lunch.

347
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,103
- Horrifying.
- Oh, I found

348
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,191
the romance section.

349
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:28,975
Now, first, I will need
the names

350
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,890
of the two people
you're choosing between.

351
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,674
- I will not be telling you
any information about them.

352
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:34,067
- No problem.
We can work with that.

353
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,895
I will just call them
by their initials.

354
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:37,157
- No.
- I will call them

355
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,898
"Couscous" and "Quinoa."
- Whatever.

356
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:40,334
- Okay, now, for this
to work right, you need

357
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:41,727
to answer these questions
without thinking.

358
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,076
Who makes you laugh more?
- Quinoa.

359
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,469
- Who has softer lips?
- Couscous.

360
00:10:44,512 --> 00:10:45,905
- A new Cirque du Soleil's
in town.

361
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:47,298
You have the two best seats
in the house.

362
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:48,690
Who are you bringing?
- Is this a reward

363
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:49,909
or a punishment?
- You decide.

364
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:50,997
- Quinoa.
- Great. Next question:

365
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,042
You die and become a ghost.

366
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,347
The rules of the afterlife

367
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:54,740
are that of the movie "Casper."

368
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,089
Whose house
would you rather haunt?

369
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:57,438
- How many more
of these questions are there?

370
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:58,744
- 309.

371
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:00,137
- Okay, I've got something.
- Oh.

372
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,052
That's not Brandon's profile.
It's mine.

373
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,401
- I just want a quick peek
at your attendance record.

374
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:04,532
Zero absences.

375
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:06,752
Oh, mama...

376
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:07,927
Printing this for later.

377
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,537
- Keep it in your pants,
Santiago.

378
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:11,365
- Oh, that's exactly
where it's going.

379
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,934
Okay, here's Brandon's info.

380
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:16,414
Third period, first semester...

381
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:18,111
Any of these people
on the football team?

382
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,679
Scott Alford, Taylor Black—
wow, Tom Brady?

383
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,507
- Different Tom Brady.
He was in theater.

384
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,856
Although he was the MVP

385
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:24,987
of that year's production
of "Fiddler."

386
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:26,250
- Hm.
- Wait a minute.

387
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:27,642
Danny Matthews.
That's the guy.

388
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:28,948
He was on the football team.

389
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:30,210
That's the bastard
who set me up.

390
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,212
- Yeah, and look at this.

391
00:11:32,256 --> 00:11:34,432
You did so much
community service.

392
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:36,129
Me like-y.

393
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:41,047
- Guys, you know how I thought
it would be so much fun

394
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,266
to lie to everyone tonight?

395
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,919
- Yeah. Did it finally
catch up with you?

396
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:45,138
- No, the opposite.
Someone wants to buy

397
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:46,487
a company I made up
on the spot.

398
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:47,923
The elevator pitch
had him drooling.

399
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,708
As a mother,
I'm always struggling

400
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,188
to find quality playdates.

401
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:54,060
Most two-year-olds
are boring, lame duds.

402
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,888
- All of my daughter's friends
suck.

403
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:58,456
- Well, with Todddddler's
proprietary algorithm,

404
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:01,111
you will be matched
with top tots,

405
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,286
and those boring duds—

406
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:03,722
they'll stay where they belong:

407
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,378
the hell away
from you and your family.

408
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,554
I'm not really sure
how to close this.

409
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:11,556
Maybe you guys could pretend
to be heirs

410
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:15,125
to a canned-goods fortune
who want to buy my company!

411
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,778
- Gina, we don't have time
for your thing right now.

412
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:18,606
- Oh, smart.
Big-time him.

413
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,999
That's the perfect idea.

414
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,348
I won't forget you
when I'm rich.

415
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,045
Thanks so much,
Jake and Jake's wife.

416
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:24,438
- She knows your name.
Oh, look!

417
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,005
It's Danny Matthews!
But he'll never talk

418
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:27,354
with all these people around.

419
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:28,964
- Not a problem.
Just be in the science lab

420
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:30,618
in ten minutes.
I'll get him alone.

421
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:31,750
- What are you gonna do?

422
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,838
- Let's just say I'm not above

423
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,318
using my feminine wiles.

424
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,928
Danny Matthews,
I'm with the school.

425
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:37,234
You need to follow me
right now.

426
00:12:37,277 --> 00:12:40,889
- Is everything—
- I said now, mister.

427
00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,195
- I'm one caller away.

428
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,501
I can't believe
we figured it out.

429
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:45,546
- And I can't believe
it took you this long.

430
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,635
Yogurt is literally
your one thing.

431
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,507
- Okay, okay.
- Well, I'm just saying.

432
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,422
If the sound were
eating damp rice,

433
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:53,163
I would've gotten it
immediately.

434
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:54,555
- Guys, they're taking
another guess.

435
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,253
- All right,
Brenda from Yonkers.

436
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:58,168
It's time for you
to name that sound.

437
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,604
- Hi.
Quick shout-out

438
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:01,432
to the nurses
at United Pediatric.

439
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:03,042
This money'll do those kids
a lot of good.

440
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:04,565
- Cry me a river.
Brenda from Yonkers.

441
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,872
We've all had budget cuts.
Just take your guess.

442
00:13:06,915 --> 00:13:08,178
- Is it Styrofoam?

443
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,744
- Wrong!

444
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,007
- Oh, I can't believe
she guessed Styrofoam.

445
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:13,792
What a dumb nurse.

446
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,663
- Next caller, you're on
with the Horndog.

447
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:16,664
- It's me!

448
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,927
The sound is a yogurt

449
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:20,233
being opened.

450
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:23,280
- That is...

451
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,585
Wrong!

452
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:25,804
- What?
No!

453
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,806
- You b-b-b-blew it!

454
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,025
- Damn you, Horndog.

455
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:31,636
- Okay, I have tabulated
your responses,

456
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,464
and the results
are definitive.

457
00:13:33,507 --> 00:13:35,596
- Amazing.
- It's a dead tie.

458
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,076
- This is dumb.
I'm just gonna end it

459
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,208
with both of them.
- Rosa, stop.

460
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,339
There is one more method.

461
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,298
Ancient Boyles believed

462
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:44,039
that suspending yourself
by your feet forces your blood

463
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,780
to the decision center
of your brain.

464
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:49,828
We call this method
the "Upside-Down Coward."

465
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,482
- You want me to hang
from the ceiling like a bat?

466
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,353
- The bat is nature's
most decisive animal.

467
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:55,007
- The creature
that flails around frantically?

468
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,226
- Those are all
micro-decisions.

469
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,705
Now, let's get you strapped up.

470
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,881
How do you feel?

471
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,013
- Nauseous.

472
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:03,058
- Good.
It's working.

473
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,277
- Q?
- Yeah.

474
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,278
- Get off the phone.

475
00:14:05,322 --> 00:14:06,410
Now, I'm not sure

476
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:07,846
how serious you were
about funding,

477
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,458
but I should tell you
there's 103 other bidders.

478
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,547
- Oof, I am not a fan
of getting into bidding wars.

479
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:16,202
- Then don't make an offer,
'cause I want babies on my app,

480
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:18,030
but not in my boardroom.

481
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:19,249
Oh, damn, Gina.

482
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,902
- Did you just
"oh, damn" yourself?

483
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:21,990
- Someone had to.

484
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:24,079
- Okay.

485
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:25,603
Let's talk numbers.

486
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:27,474
- Mr. Peralta, I believe
you know Danny Matthews.

487
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,259
- Jake.
Hey, what's going on, man?

488
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,477
- The answer to that question

489
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:33,437
goes back to a brisk day
in 1997,

490
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,874
a day you told a lie.

491
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:39,007
But the lying stops right now!

492
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:40,574
Oh, no!

493
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:42,272
You broke some poor kid's
science project!

494
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:43,577
We have to fix it.

495
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:44,926
- Kind of in the middle
of something.

496
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,145
- Oh, you know what?
Krebs cycle.

497
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:47,146
I got this.

498
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,974
- Great.
So, Danny,

499
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:50,105
true or false?

500
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,411
You were on the football team.

501
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,152
- True?
- And true or false:

502
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,241
you had third period
with Brandon Bliss.

503
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,590
- Mm, I honestly
don't remember—

504
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:57,983
- It was true!
We checked the records,

505
00:14:58,026 --> 00:14:59,463
and I have one more question.

506
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,291
- Ooh, Jake, can you get me
that oxygen on the floor?

507
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,727
Little red guy.
- What?

508
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,728
- Sorry.
You know what?

509
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:05,164
Yeah, I'll get it.

510
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:06,383
- Why did you tell
Brandon Bliss

511
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,862
that I was the Tattler?

512
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,473
- Because you were.
I saw you talking to principal.

513
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:10,735
I remember it, clear as day.

514
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,302
- Look, you couldn't
have seen me,

515
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,868
because I wasn't there.
I didn't tattle.

516
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,609
- Man, it was you, okay?

517
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,655
You had your long hair
and your little earring,

518
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:21,223
and the denim jacket you are
literally wearing right now.

519
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,964
- Oh, no.

520
00:15:23,008 --> 00:15:25,053
It wasn't me,

521
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:27,142
but it was the DDC.

522
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,579
Gina.

523
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:31,190
- Jake, guess who just sold
her app idea.

524
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:32,365
- Don't trust her.

525
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:33,845
Everything she's told you
is a lie.

526
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,368
She made up the company
and everything else.

527
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:36,587
She's a liar.

528
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,197
- Jake, whatever strategy
this is

529
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,025
is not necessary.
I already closed the deal.

530
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,810
- I know you were the Tattler.

531
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,294
- Amy, I'm ready to go.

532
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,382
- Yep, totally.

533
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:50,731
I'm almost done
with this project,

534
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,211
but I don't need
to finish it,

535
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:53,386
because what matters

536
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,388
is that you are going
through something,

537
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:58,173
and as your wife,
and love of your life—

538
00:15:58,217 --> 00:15:59,871
- Are you vamping
so you can finish that?

539
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,263
- I only have
two molecules left.

540
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,483
Come on, man.
- Jake, we need to talk.

541
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,180
- Yeah, you guys
do need to talk.

542
00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:07,966
That sounds excellent.
Friendship, so much history...

543
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,707
I'm just gonna get this
out of your way.

544
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,665
- Oh, man.

545
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:13,014
What the hell, Gina?

546
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:15,016
You ruined
my entire senior year.

547
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,366
How could you do that to me?

548
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,802
- Jake, I was only
trying to help.

549
00:16:17,845 --> 00:16:19,369
You were hanging out
with those guys

550
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,240
and getting close,
and they weren't good people.

551
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:23,198
Do you know why Brandon
wasn't at the reunion tonight?

552
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:24,635
- I don't know.
Probably 'cause he was shooting

553
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:25,940
a beer commercial
where the whole plot

554
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,377
was that everyone wanted
to sleep with him.

555
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,943
- No, 'cause he's on parole.

556
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,032
He's not allowed to leave
the state of Delaware.

557
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:32,860
- Oh, okay, so that's
obviously a bummer,

558
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,384
but I wasn't gonna end up
like him.

559
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,515
- You were starting to.
You wanted

560
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,821
to steal a van with him,

561
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:38,083
and I told you not to,

562
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:39,606
and you weren't listening
to me.

563
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,216
I mean, what would've happened
if you got caught?

564
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,392
- I don't know.

565
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,958
- You would never
have become a cop.

566
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,960
Yeah, I'm the reason
you're a cop.

567
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,571
I'm your origin story, dude.

568
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,181
You can't be mad at me.

569
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:50,748
- I feel like
I'm still pretty mad.

570
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,576
- Peter Parker wasn't mad
at his spider.

571
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:54,534
- Yeah, but they weren't
best friends before the bite,

572
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,449
and it still doesn't explain
how you let everyone think

573
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:58,320
I was the Tattler for 20 years.

574
00:16:58,364 --> 00:17:00,322
- Well, I didn't want
to lose our friendship.

575
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,628
I was being weak.

576
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:03,891
I'm sorry.

577
00:17:03,935 --> 00:17:05,719
- Okay.

578
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,199
- And if it makes you
feel any better,

579
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,462
that app thing
completely blew up in my face.

580
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,421
I mean, my night sucked.

581
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,205
Okay, I can see
from your expression

582
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:14,859
that your night was worse,

583
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:17,514
and I should've left it
at "sorry."

584
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:18,906
- So did you hear?

585
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,994
Someone guessed the sound.

586
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,431
It was a bag of chips.

587
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:22,736
- Wow.
So the lesson here

588
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,390
is to listen to Hitchcock
and Scully more?

589
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,739
- No, that can't be possible.
- Yeah, I don't think

590
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:27,306
we earned that today.
- Agreed.

591
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,090
- Sorry for dragging you
into that dumb game.

592
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:31,310
You were right.
It was a waste of time.

593
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:32,746
- No, it wasn't.

594
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,400
Even though it was pointless,
I did enjoy myself.

595
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,533
I can't wait
to go home and tell Kevin

596
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:39,449
you can have fun
without being productive.

597
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:42,495
- Hey, guys, they're about
to play the new mystery sound.

598
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:43,801
- I can tell Kevin tomorrow.

599
00:17:43,844 --> 00:17:45,106
- I'll bet Sharon's
already asleep.

600
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,804
- And I've got no one
in my life.

601
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,328
- Scully, play that damn noise.

602
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:51,461
- Quentin, can I talk to you
for a minute?

603
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,201
- Are you here to give me
a long speech

604
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:54,768
about how you still deserve
my money?

605
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:55,813
- No.

606
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:57,031
I am.

607
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,468
- Very cool entrance.

608
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,817
- Thank you.
Listen.

609
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,732
Gina Linetti is not
a perfect person.

610
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:02,907
- Mm, I'm hoping this gets
more supportive

611
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,212
as it goes along.

612
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,605
- But what she lacks
in perfection,

613
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:07,172
she makes up for

614
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:08,869
with an utter and total belief
that she is perfect.

615
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,218
- Ooh, you said "but,"
and then you said

616
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:12,046
something worse.
- She is fiercely loyal.

617
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,614
She will do
the right thing for you

618
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,964
even when you can't see it
for yourself,

619
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:19,880
and she's saved my ass
countless times.

620
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,142
- And it's been 12.
I counted.

621
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:22,622
- She came up with an idea
on the spot

622
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,102
that you were interested in.

623
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,496
Imagine what she could do
with time and resources.

624
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,410
Do the world a favor.

625
00:18:28,454 --> 00:18:30,717
Invest in Gina Linetti.

626
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:35,809
- Hard pass.

627
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,681
both: What?
- But my great speech.

628
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:38,986
- Yeah, the speech was great,

629
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,685
but I've also been lying
the whole night.

630
00:18:41,728 --> 00:18:43,121
I'm not a tech mogul.

631
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,470
I came here
to mess with people.

632
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,341
- How dare you?
- Speaking of which,

633
00:18:46,385 --> 00:18:48,300
did either one of you drive?
'Cause I could use a ride.

634
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:50,563
- No, Quentin.
- Oh, Quentin.

635
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,087
- Okay.

636
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,393
Now open your eyes,

637
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:56,656
and the person you are meant
to be with

638
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,833
should appear before you.

639
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:02,880
- Sorry.
I was just watching.

640
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:05,230
- Get out of here, Hitchcock!

641
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:06,013
Ugh.

642
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:07,232
- This isn't working.

643
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:08,668
I'm no closer
to making a decision.

644
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:09,974
I'm jumping down.

645
00:19:10,017 --> 00:19:11,541
- Well, you can't
just jump down.

646
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,978
My goodness!
- It's over.

647
00:19:14,021 --> 00:19:15,153
I'm gonna put 'em both
in a group text

648
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,284
and say "peace out."
- Uh, no!

649
00:19:16,328 --> 00:19:17,590
There's still more options.

650
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:18,983
We haven't even
done roleplay yet.

651
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:20,550
- What?

652
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,725
Ugh.

653
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:22,856
I took too long
getting back to Quinoa

654
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,118
and they got mad
and ended it.

655
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,685
- And that's how it's done.

656
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,557
- What are you talking about?
- The process worked.

657
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,036
Boyles don't make decisions.

658
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,385
We delay our decisions

659
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:32,083
until the universe
makes them for us.

660
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:34,259
That way, we never make
a wrong choice.

661
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:36,435
- That is very sad,
but also, I guess it worked.

662
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:37,828
- Mm-hmm.
- I do feel pretty good.

663
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:39,394
Couscous is dope.
She's funny.

664
00:19:39,438 --> 00:19:41,005
- Couscous is a she!
I knew it!

665
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:43,007
- Did you?
- No, and I still don't know.

666
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,051
There's equal chance
you called them "she"

667
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,052
to throw me off.

668
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:48,229
- You get me, Boyle.

669
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:51,450
- So I think I figured out
an awesome and dramatic way

670
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:53,800
to reveal that I
was the Tattler.

671
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,585
It'll be a dance.
There'll be costumes.

672
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,065
- Gina, it's fine.
I don't care anymore.

673
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:00,067
It's all in the past.
- Oh, thank God.

674
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:01,591
That is such a relief,

675
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,854
'cause I didn't want people
thinking I was a tattler.

676
00:20:03,897 --> 00:20:05,769
Where's Amy?

677
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,031
- She is in the library,
writing

678
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:08,380
a book report
on "Jane Eyre,"

679
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:10,904
and she told me
"not to wait up."

680
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:12,079
- Oy.
- Yeah.

681
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:15,126
- Thanks for trying to help
with Quentin.

682
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:16,649
It's funny.
Even though it wasn't real,

683
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,696
it was so fun, imagining
running my own company.

684
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:20,958
- So why don't your pursue it?

685
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:23,090
- I can't raise my kid
and create an app

686
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,701
and work at the Nine-Nine.
It's too much.

687
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:26,920
- Well, then prepare for me
to murder your parents

688
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,008
right in front of your face.

689
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:29,227
- Rude.
- No.

690
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,794
It's Batman's origin story,

691
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,709
like the radioactive
spider thing you did with me.

692
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:34,275
- I don't read comic books.

693
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,017
- You helped me
become who I am,

694
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,715
so now I'm gonna
return the favor.

695
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,414
Gina...

696
00:20:42,457 --> 00:20:44,372
I think your talents might
be wasted at the Nine-Nine.

697
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,114
I love you, but it might
be time for you to move on.

698
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:48,768
- Um, are you firing me?

699
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:49,769
- What? No.
I don't think

700
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:50,770
I could even do that.

701
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,076
- Good, because I quit.

702
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,555
You know, tonight I realized

703
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,948
that my talents

704
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,471
are being wasted
at the Nine-Nine.

705
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:58,386
- Okay, that's kind of exactly
what I just said.

706
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,651
- Jake, let me finish.
This is serious.

707
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:03,696
It's time for me to move on.

708
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,698
For real, though, it is.

709
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:06,699
- Really?

710
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,705
Okay.

711
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:14,359
- Proud of you.

712
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:15,534
- Thank you.

713
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:16,796
I'm proud of me, too.

714
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:19,625
- Guys!

715
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:20,931
Vice principal caught me
in the library.

716
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:22,802
Let's roll!

717
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,804
- Not a doctor.
Shh.

718
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,806
- Fremulon.
