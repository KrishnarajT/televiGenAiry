don't know this,

00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:25,976
Guys, come on,
I've got a great plan here.

174
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:28,413
No one wants in?
- Absolutely not!

175
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,763
Tell me the plan.
I want in.

176
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:32,156
- What?
You do?

177
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,418
- Yeah.
Terry loves love.

178
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,680
- Then why didn't you
back me up in there?

179
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:36,508
- Because Terry
also loves hedging.

180
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:39,119
- Terry loves hedging?
That's new.

181
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,773
- No, it's classic Terry.

182
00:05:40,817 --> 00:05:43,384
Look, I always play both sides
till the last possible minute,

183
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,647
everyone knows that.

184
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,518
- That's not fair.
Everyone's so hard on me.

185
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:48,302
I want a public show of support
for my plan.

186
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:49,826
- Can't do it.
Look, I don't know

187
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:51,523
what's so tough for you
to understand here.

188
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,220
I love the scheme,
I wanna be a part of it,

189
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:54,700
but I think it's gonna fail,

190
00:05:54,744 --> 00:05:57,398
and I don't want people
to think I was a part of it.

191
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:58,704
- Fine, I'll take
what I can get.

192
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:00,271
- Yes!

193
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:02,099
- Damn it,
these blackout curtains

194
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,318

Ugh!

You screwed me on this,
Shannon from Buy Buy Baby!

Mac's issues with sleeping

197
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:10,411
might not be the light
in the room,

198
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:12,109
it might be the darkness
in your heart.

199
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:14,372
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, that was mean.

200
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,503
I was trying to be poetic.

201
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,244
It's important to be mindful

202

when you're with an infant.

203

I'm sort of a natural mother.

204

- Oh, man, I have no idea.

208

- Hey, were you followed?
- Nope.

209
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,304
I promise, they have no idea
I'm working with you.

210
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,480
- Terry, have you seen Jake?

211
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:36,829
- Uh, no.

212
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:38,918
That idiot's probably off
working his dumb plan.

213
00:06:38,962 --> 00:06:40,398
He's so stupid.

214
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,269
You know, the only reason
Holt and I haven't fired him

215
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:44,924
is that we're worried
that he'll kill himself.

216
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:47,057
- Seems a little excessive.
- I told you.

217
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,580
I don't wanna be
tied to this plan.

218
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,103
Look, I'm out on a ledge
for you,

219
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,149
and Terry hates ledges.

220
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,846
- Wait, so you love hedges
but hate ledges?

221
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,326
You're just making this up
as you go.

222
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:56,631
- No, I'm not.
Name one time

223
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:58,285
you've ever seen me
happy out on a ledge.

224
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,113
- I can't think of an example
on the spot—

225
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:02,768
- Because Terry hates ledges.

226
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:04,639
Now, come on, tell me the plan.
- Fine.

227
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:06,337
Step one was getting them
here together.

228
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,643
Step two, reignite the passion.

229
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,167
You'll handle Captain Holt.

230
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,169
- Sir, you have something
on your pants.

231
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:14,519
- Huh, I've sat in some sap,
like a sap.

232
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:16,042
- At least you have
a sense of humor about it.

233
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:17,609
- Not intentionally.
I was upset

234
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:20,351
and stumbled
into accidental wordplay.

235
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:22,788
- Meanwhile,
I will take care of Kevin.

236
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:24,790
- Kevin Cozner,
entering the kitchen.

237
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:25,878
- Oh, hey there, Kev.

238
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,227
I was just grabbing
a bite to eat.

239
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:28,620
Can I offer you something?
- Well, I shouldn't,

240
00:07:28,663 --> 00:07:31,057
but today's been a fiasco,
so what the hell.

241
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,145
I'll have a snack
of some water.

242
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:33,668
- What Kevin won't know

243
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:35,932
is that he will be drinking
from a dribble cup.

244
00:07:35,975 --> 00:07:37,194
- Oh, dear.

245
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:38,978
- And you said I was crazy
to buy stock

246
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:40,371
in Spencer's Gifts.

247
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:41,981
- How does you buying
one novelty cup

248
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,243
help the company's stock price?

249
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:44,679
- It boosts confidence
in the marketplace.

250
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,507
You just don't know anything
about business, Terry!

251
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,900
- Okay, so we've ruined
their outfits.

252
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,684
Why will that
"reignite the passion"?

253
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,034
- Because it will force them
to change

254
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:53,166
into clothes which I will have
carefully placed

255
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,689

Thus changing them both
into a couple of thirst traps.

descend the master stairca—

258
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:04,569
- Oh, I see you've changed
into your... mock turtleneck.

259
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:08,703
- And you into your...
exercise shorts.

260

You feel dirty?

And I love it.

of full here, Scully.

266
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:23,370
- I can toss it to you.
- Wha—

at my baby!

what I'm about to do.

I'm just happy
he's getting the care he needs.

273
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,561
- Okay, you might wanna be
a little less cocky

274

until after you
actually get him down.

275
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,738
Because, you know,
some babies are just fussy

276

It's really helped
with my metaphors.

284
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,058
- You think they'll agree
to have a picnic?

285
00:08:59,102 --> 00:09:00,886
They won't even be
in the same room together.

286
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,757

an unbaited gill net, Terry.

287
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:04,585

Forage for berries?

back together!

Now for Operation Corn Crake.

292

Hey, Kevin, I have a question.

293
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,769
- Is the corn crake
an important bird?

294
00:09:14,813 --> 00:09:15,858
- Yes.

295
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:16,946

the rarest species

in common, huh?

the corn crake

00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:55,870
This is a little too much
for me.

344
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:57,785
Also, this is not the vibe
I was looking for.

345
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:59,048
- No, no, no,
Ro-ro, Ro-ro.

346
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,266
I need your help.

347
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,051
- No, no, no.
Adios, amigo.

348
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,922
- [huffs]

349
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:11,321
- [imitates bird call]

350
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:13,018
Oh.
You are not a corn crake.

351
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,237
- But you heard the call?

352
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,761
- Yes, it was... majestic.

353
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:19,329
- Well, look what we caught
in our gill net,

354
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:20,983
a couple of fresh, fatty trout.

355
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,419
That'll last us
the next five days.

356
00:11:22,462 --> 00:11:24,029
More if we eat the egg sac.

357
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:26,031
- Jake, the picnic.

358
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:27,641
It attracted bees!

359
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:29,382
- Ack.
Oh.

360
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:31,036
Oh, God, they're everywhere!

361
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,516
[screams]
Get away!

362
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,604
Quick, everyone form a wall
around me!

363
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:35,084
- Peralta.
- I'm sorry, Kevin.

364
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,389
It's just I'm very allergic.

365
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,608
If I get stung,
I have a terrible reaction.

366
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:39,697
- Kind of like this?
- Oh, my—

367
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,047
No, that's much worse,
I just get a scratchy throat.

368
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,918
Why didn't you cower
behind someone?

369
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,836
- All right, we should be good.

370
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,881
I think the swarm is gone.

371
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:50,795
- I think
I was only stung once.

372
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:53,058
How do I look?

373
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:54,538
- Good, good, very good.
- Normal, very normal.

374
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,626
- Stop it.

375
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:57,106
Kevin doesn't like to be
lied to.

376
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,803
You're disgusting to look at.
- Thank you, Raymond.

377
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,326
I have an EpiPen
back at the house.

378
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,632
Would you call someone
to have them bring it?

379
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,503
- There's no reception.
I'll just run back.

380
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:05,157
I haven't done cardio
in 20 years.

381
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,116
How hard can it be?

382
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,205
It's immediately awful!

383
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:11,511
- Here, while we wait,
you could try putting this

384
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:12,947
chilled bottle of champagne
against your eyes.

385
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:14,340
It might help.
- Peralta, why is there

386
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:17,517
a romantic picnic sitting
in this remote clearing?

387
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:19,954
You set this whole thing up,
didn't you?

388
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:22,044
- Nuh-uh.
- You've manipulated us

389
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,697
into spending time together.

390
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:24,916
- Nuh-uh.

391
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,830
- Is that your entire defense?
"Nuh-uh"?

392
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,136
- Uh-huh.

393
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,267
Okay, fine, all right?
Yes.

394
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,095
But only because
I care about you.

395
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,314
And by the way,
you should really make

396
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:32,924
your shared calendar
less easy to access.

397
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:34,578
- You got into our calendar?
- Yeah, you already knew that.

398
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,970
You said I set
the whole thing up.

399
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:36,928
- I was talking
about the picnic.

400
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,277
What were you talking about?

401
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,191
- Nuh-uh.

402
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,497
- You tricked us into coming

403
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,064
to the Lake House
at the same time.

404
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:43,543
You did
a "Das Doppelte Lottchen."

405
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:45,023
- What?
I don't know what that is.

406
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,330
- "Das Doppelte Lottchen"!
- I'm only half.

407
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:49,941
- It's a German novel
about a set of twins

408
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,682
who try to reunite
their estranged parents.

409
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:52,944
- That's the "Parent Trap"!

410
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:54,815
I knew my stratagem
had classy origins.

411
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,557
- Peralta,
this is my personal life.

412
00:12:57,601 --> 00:12:58,906
You've crossed a line.

413
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,213
I'm leaving.
- So am I.

414
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:03,476
- Oh, no, wait, Kevin—
- [grunts]

415
00:13:04,477 --> 00:13:06,784
- Are there tools in here?
You see a saw anywhere?

416
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,090
- I told you to stay away,
Charles.

417
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,439
I'm not into your energy.

418
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:10,570
- Amy!

419
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:12,442
Hi!
Hi, Amy!

420
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:14,052
- Hi.

421
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,619
Look, I just wanted to say
thank you

422
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,229
for getting Mac to sleep.

423
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,405
I was being really stubborn
earlier,

424
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:22,147
and I guess
what I'm trying to say

425
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:24,845
is can I please have
your nip tips?

426
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,239
- You don't want my nip tips,
those crusty old things.

427
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:28,588
- Oh, God,
I can't be here for this.

428
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:30,634
Oh, my mouth is so dry.
It's all bad.

429
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,984
- What's all bad?
- I can't tell you, Amy.

430
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:34,028
- What can't you tell me?

431
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:37,728
- It's too real.
I need to leave.

432
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:39,730
Damn it, I was looking
for somewhere to be alone.

433
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:41,297
- Sorry, I came out here
looking for a signal

434
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,994
to call Hitchcock, but no luck.

435
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:44,648
I can take my chips and go.

436
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,041
- Wait, you have chips?

437
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:48,782
You could stay.
- Oh.

438
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,263
- So we got off to a bad start
there with the bees

439
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:53,265
and Kevin rolling down
the hill,

440
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:54,875
and then, of course,
the second swarm of bees,

441
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,790
but we're good now, right?

442
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,401
Can you guys hear me?

443
00:13:58,444 --> 00:14:00,272
You keep moving away from me
for some reason.

444
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:02,883
- Ugh, I wish a bee would sting
me in both ears right now

445
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,146
so they'd seal shut as well.

446
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:05,321
- What was that?
I couldn't hear you!

447
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:06,713
I'll just assume you said,
"Keep going."

448
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:08,498
Anyways, yeah, I just figured

449
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,890
if I could
get you guys together,

450
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,327
I could create
a magical moment.

451
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,373
But of course, we now know
that magic doesn't exist.

452
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,592
- Shh!

453
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:16,506
It's a corn crake.

454
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:18,638
- Oh, no, I can't believe it.

455
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:21,206
I finally spot a corn crake,
and my eyes are swollen shut.

456
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,947
- It's okay, Kevin.
I'll describe it to you.

457
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,557
Okay, have you ever seen
a duck?

458
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,298
- Peralta, I got this.
- Oh, okay.

459
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:29,823
- The beak color
is Pantone 4685C.

460
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,260
- Mm.

461
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:36,003
— The wing is Pantone 2322
- C
spotted with 4515C.

462
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,396
- Ooh.

463
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,184
— The tail is Pantone 7525
- C
with bands of 419C.

464
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:43,315
- Oh, my, my.

465
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:45,622
- Oh, Kevin, the throat...

466
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:49,713
Pantone 7528C.

467
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,497
- Oh, Raymond.

468
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,934
- Those are some hot Pantones.

469
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:56,328
- Okay, Barbecue.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:57,982
- Sweet Maui Onion,

471
00:14:58,025 --> 00:15:00,332
and the surprising underdog,
Original.

472
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:02,029
- I think I'm ready to crown
a Chipeon.

473
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:03,292
- Chipeon?
That's good.

474
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,119
- Yeah, I came up with it
because I misspoke.

475
00:15:05,163 --> 00:15:08,297
- [laughing]

476
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,343
- [laughs]

477
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:12,997
[sighs] Can I join you?

478
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,259
Mac's never been asleep
this long,

479
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:15,521
and I don't know
what to do with myself.

480
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,566
- Charles locked your kid
in the room.

481
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,045
- What?
- You made me say it.

482
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,438
If I didn't, you would've
stayed here and ruined this

483
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,048
good thing I got going
with Scully and his chips.

484
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:22,746
- Wait, Mac is locked
in a room?

485
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,227
Oh, my...

486
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,358
Charles!
- Amy!

487
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:27,446
I was just doing
a little handiwork,

488
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,708
you know,
fixing up the old house.

489
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:30,101
- I know you locked my son
in there.

490
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:31,842
- I'm sorry.
I tried everything.

491
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:33,757
Maybe he'll be happy
growing up in that room.

492
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,975
- Oh, shut up, Charles!

493
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,368
I'll get him out.
Move.

494
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:37,891
- I'm telling you,
it's impossible.

495
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:39,197
- Not for his mother.

496
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:41,634
[screams, grunts]

497
00:15:41,678 --> 00:15:45,159
[baby crying]

498
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,552
- Wow!

499
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,162
- Sorry that took me so long.

500
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,816
I cramped up halfway and then
crawled for a little while.

501
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,427
Maybe I should think
about slimming down.

502
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,645
- No, it's actually good
you didn't make it back.

503
00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:54,430
- Oh, thank you
for saying that.

504
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:56,258
Look, I can't change my body,
it defines me.

505
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:57,998
- No, no, no,
we really saw a corn crake.

506
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,522
Holt had to describe it
to Kevin,

507
00:15:59,565 --> 00:16:01,045
and now he's leading him,
by the hand, out of the woods.

508
00:16:01,088 --> 00:16:03,265
The Parent Trap worked!
I can't wait to tell the squad.

509
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:04,788
- Wait, wait, let me give Kevin
the EpiPen,

510
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,355
and then we can
tell them together.

511
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,183
- Okay, whoa, whoa.
Pump the brakes there, Sonic.

512
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:11,055
- What?
- Sonic the Hedgehog.
