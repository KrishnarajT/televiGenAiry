1
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:09,081
- For most people, a burrito
is a delicious meal

2
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:12,215
wrapped in a tortilla
but for one NYPD officer,

3
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:15,261
it turned out to be a mouse
wrapped in a nightmare.

4
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:16,828
- So I order a grande steak.

5
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:18,873
I get back to my car,
take a big bite, and crunch.

6
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:20,701
That's when I see it—
a dead mouse.

7
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:22,790
- A dead mouse
that Frank O'Sullivan,

8
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,314
the President
of the Patrolman's Union,

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,533
says was put there on purpose.

10
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:28,796
- This was an act
of political violence

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,236
organized by a group of radical
anti-cop Antifa anarchists

12
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:35,020
working out
of The Burrito Haven.

13
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:36,717
- This is bogus.

14
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:39,459
The officer called in a to-go
order under the name Tom.

15
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:41,592
The restaurant had no idea
he was a cop

16
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:43,289
when they made the food
or packed the bag.

17
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,466
So, clearly, he wasn't targeted
for "being a police officer."

18
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,251
- I've always wanted
to try mouse meat.

19
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:50,383
I hear it's really tasty.
- From who?

20
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:52,342
- The union made it up
as a power move.

21
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,691
O'Sullivan wants me to issue

22
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,736
a statement of public support
for the officer,

23
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,477
to give them
all extra hazard pay

24
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:00,393
and to wear this
Never Forget Burrito ribbon.

25
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:02,090
- Weird. It's the exact
same color

26
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:03,788
as my Color Blind Awareness
ribbon.

27
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,312
- No, it isn't. I won't give in
to any of their demands.

28
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,748
The union is powerful,
but I'm sure

29
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:09,968
that most of our uniformed
officers understand

30
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:11,752
this incident is nonsense.

31
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:15,278
It is, as Peralta would say,
"No big 'whoop.'"

32
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:16,757
- I appreciate
the shout-out, sir,

33
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:18,411
but I actually don't pronounce
the H in whoop.

34
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,371
- Sir, all the uniformed
officers just left.

35
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,111
They're staging a walkout.

36
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:25,592
- Well, it seems I was wrong.

37
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:28,682
The "whoop" is big after all.

38
00:01:28,726 --> 00:01:29,814
- It is.

39
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,469
Again, though,
there's no H in whoop.

40
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:33,818
It's silent.

41
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,210
- "Whoop."

42
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:36,603
- Whoop.
- "Whoop."

43
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:38,170
- Am I crazy?
How do you say it?

44
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:40,128
- I say "whoop."
- Okay.

45
00:01:43,175 --> 00:01:50,095
♪

46
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:02,977
- How is it possible that every
single uniformed officer

47
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:04,196
got sick at once?

48
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,502
- They're not actually sick.

49
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:06,764
They aren't actually
allowed to strike,

50
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,113
so they made up
a medical excuse.

51
00:02:08,156 --> 00:02:09,593
It's called a Blue Flu.

52
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,769
- Without uniforms on the
street, crime's gonna go up.

53
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:13,161
Do we have to negotiate
with the union?

54
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:15,381
- No. I haven't gone through
decades of hell

55
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:17,383
to become a captain in the NYPD

56
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:19,472
just to cave to a clown
like O'Sullivan.

57
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:21,474
We can't let him win,
and we won't.

58
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:22,649
- But how?
What are we gonna do?

59
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:24,521
- I'm initiating
Operation Trident.

60
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:26,392
- Cool.
Just like the sugarless gum—

61
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:27,828
because we're gonna
chew them up.

62
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:30,744
- No, like the famed weapon
of the sea,

63
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:33,443
forged by the Cyclops
for Poseidon himself.

64
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,184
The trident has three prongs,
like my approach.

65
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:37,447
- Ah, not to interrupt,

66
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,144
but Aquaman's trident
has five prongs.

67
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:42,452
- That's absurd.
The prefix tri means three.

68
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,368
What this aquatic-man carries
is better termed a "pentadent."

69
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:46,760
- No, it's a trident.

70
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:48,414
They call it that in the
original theatrical release

71
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,024
and the Snyder cut.

72
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:51,504
So you're 100% wrong,
and everyone's laughing at you.

73
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,679
- Well, regardless,

74
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:54,377
Operation Trident
has three prongs.

75
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,987
Prong one, Boyle and Peralta.

76
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,641
- Oh, nice,
the most important prong.

77
00:02:57,684 --> 00:02:58,685
- Mm-hmm.
- Wrong.

78
00:02:58,729 --> 00:02:59,947
Prong two, the center prong,

79
00:02:59,991 --> 00:03:01,775
is the most important prong
on a trident.

80
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,211
It's the longest
and straightest

81
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:04,648
and breaks the least often.

82
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:05,866
- Are you just mad because

83
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,259
I questioned you
about the Aquaman thing?

84
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:09,696
- Yes. The officers
all had doctor's notes.

85
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,828
Prove those notes
are fraudulent,

86
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,525
and they'll be forced
back to work.

87
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,048
- We're on it.
- Prong two—

88
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:17,138
Jeffords and Santiago,
your job is to keep crime down.

89
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:19,706
Figure out how we police
this precinct with no police.

90
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,969
- Prong two, baby—
the best prong.

91
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:23,754
- I mean,
we're all in it together.

92
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,451
It's not like this is
a competition between prongs.

93
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:27,148
- Says the prong
who breaks the most.

94
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:30,282
- Prong three is proving they
faked the mouse in the burrito.

95
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:32,719
If we can demonstrate
this was a media stunt,

96
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:34,808
the uniforms will have to
come back to work.

97
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:36,897
But this investigation
must be done unofficially

98
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,422
with an investigator from
outside the NYPD,

99
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:41,772
aka Rosa Diaz.

100
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:43,817
- It's a good idea,
but she's not gonna like being

101
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,906
one of those dinky side prongs.
- That's a good point.

102
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,995
I'll make hers the sharpest.
Dismissed.

103
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,302
- What? No!
I want to be a sharp prong!

104
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,912
That's not fair!

105
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:54,045
- All these notes are
from the same doctor.

106
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:56,482
- Everyone got a blood test,
and they all had mono.

107
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:57,744
That seems really improbable.

108
00:03:57,788 --> 00:03:59,442
- Yeah, nobody gets mono
at this age.

109
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:00,704
You get it as an
eight-year-old,

110
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:02,009
and then you're immune.

111
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:03,446
- Wait, you get it
as an eight-year-old?

112
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,490
Mono? The kissing disease?

113
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:05,752
- No, it's
the cousin's disease.

114
00:04:05,796 --> 00:04:07,145
You get it
by kissing your cousins.

115
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:09,452
Oh, I guess we're both right.
- No.

116
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,758
Wait a minute—
if you're immune,

117
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:13,804
then you can tell the doctor
you're from the Nine-Nine,

118
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:15,545
and when he gives you
a mono diagnosis...

119
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,372
- We'll have proof
that his notes are fake.

120
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,765
- Wow.

121
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,463
I can't believe all those
lazy childhood afternoons

122
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:22,116
playing hide the yam
finally paid off.

123
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,818
You see, you take a yam—
- I don't want to know!

124
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:29,341
- Prong two update—
I brought in

125
00:04:29,384 --> 00:04:31,691
our night-shift detectives
to handle the dispatch calls

126
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:34,912
and respond to major crimes—

127
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:37,262
- Sorry. That's Terry's tummy.

128
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:38,785
I'm feeling a little nauseous.

129
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,352
Must've been something
I had for breakfast.

130
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:42,136
- Well, do you have to go home,
or can you tough it out?

131
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,138
- So, if Terry goes home,
he's not tough?

132
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,792
- Here we go.

133
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:47,315
- Lieutenant, we don't have
the time today to make this

134
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,665
about some larger insecurity

135
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,231
you have regarding
your toughness.

136
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,799
- First of all, I'm not
insecure about my toughness.

137
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:56,411
Secondly, being sick has
nothing to do with being tough.

138
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:59,719
Thirdly, if I wasn't tough,
would I be daring Amy

139
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:01,895
to punch me in the stomach?
- Wha—

140
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,636
- Come on, Amy!
Give me your best shot!

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,638
- Fine.
Just so that we can move on.

142
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,862
- See? I'm fine.

143
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,603
Now, if you'll excuse me,

144
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,996
I'm gonna go for a walk
in the fresh air

145
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,999
with my best friend,
the trash can.

146
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:20,610
I'll be back 'cause I'm tough!

147
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,263
- Let's talk quickly
before he returns

148
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:24,048
and makes this all
about himself again.

149
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,963
- Okay. We can't use uniforms
from other precincts

150
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:27,355
because they'll call
out sick, too.

151
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,662
So I asked the other captains
in the district

152
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:31,011
to lend us some detectives.

153
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,230
- Smart.
They have a different union.

154
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,971
- And they each sent us
two people.

155
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,494
They said
they were happy to do it.

156
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,191
- Huh. That's odd.

157
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:41,065
I wouldn't be happy to give up
two of my detectives, unless—

158
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,283
- Dear God.

159
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:44,459
They sent us
their Hitchcock-and-Scullys.

160
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,461
- It's a nightmare.

161
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:47,680
- So you've been
feeling fatigued?

162
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,464
- Yeah. I think I have mono.

163
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,249
I'm from the 99th precinct.

164
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,555
- Ah, yeah, I've heard

165
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:54,034
they've had some kind
of outbreak there.

166
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:56,297
- Mm-hmm. So now that you know
where I'm from,

167
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:57,864
can you just write me a note?

168
00:05:57,908 --> 00:05:59,692
- Uh, no, actually, I need to
order bloodwork

169
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:01,607
and do a full exam.
- Ah.

170
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:03,043
- Lift up.
- Oh, yeah.

171
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:04,915
- Oh. Now, that is interesting.

172
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,047
- Oh, did you find
a sign of mono?

173
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:08,875
- No, it's your testicle.
- My what?

174
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,529
- The left one is enormous.

175
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,879
- Oh, well, can't one testicle
be larger than the other?

176
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:15,229
- Well, yes,
but it shouldn't be that large.

177
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:18,232
And also of concern
is the shape and the color...

178
00:06:18,276 --> 00:06:19,669
- Yeah, that doesn't
sound good.

179
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,844
- And the texture.

180
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:23,107
Wow! Oh, that is ice cold!

181
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,851
- So...
- So...

182
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:29,330
- You heard all that?
- I did.

183
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:31,158
- Even the part where
he's talking about my huge—

184
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:34,248
- Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
All the parts.

185
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:35,641
You okay?
- Yeah.

186
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,904
I mean, could be cancer.
Might have spread.

187
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,471
But I'm fine.
I can handle this.

188
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:41,125
- You sure about that?

189
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:44,389
'Cause you're still wearing
your hospital gown there, bud.

190
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,174
- So I am.

191
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:48,915
- Ah, there she is.

192
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,439
My sweet secret prong three.

193
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:52,876
- What the hell?
- Oh, right.

194
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,008
You weren't there when
I explained Operation Trident.

195
00:06:55,052 --> 00:06:56,183
So, uh, what did you find?

196
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:57,750
- Nothing yet,
and if you want me

197
00:06:57,794 --> 00:06:59,230
to keep digging,
we need to talk about my fee.

198
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:01,145
I need cash. Most of
my other work is pro bono.

199
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,103
- This is unofficial.
I can't pay.

200
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,105
- Right, but there is something
you can give me,

201
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:07,107
something just
as valuable as money.

202
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:09,849
I want to see your tattoo.
- That's just as valuable?

203
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,156
- It is to Jake. He's offered
a significant reward.

204
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,637
- Wow. It is so ridiculous
how much weight

205
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,290
you've all given
to my silly tattoo,

206
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:18,684
like it's some huge secret
that I'll take to my grave.

207
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:19,859
- I notice
you haven't said yes yet.

208
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:21,556
- 'Cause no one can ever know.

209
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,080
Okay, fine.

210
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:26,300
If you can prove how that mouse
got into that burrito,

211
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:27,954
I'll tell you
what my tattoo is.

212
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:30,043
- I need a photo of it.
- You're a monster.

213
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:31,654
Wait. I may not have
to deal with you.

214
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:32,959
Santiago,
how's prong two looking?

215
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:34,613
- Well, the good news

216
00:07:34,657 --> 00:07:36,659
is the Scully-and-Hitchcocks
actually work well together.

217
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,138
- That is good news.

218
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:40,488
- The bad news is it's at
making a back-scratch circle.

219
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:42,490
- I always wondered
what it would be like to have

220
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:43,927
a tight-knit work family.

221
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,843
Nine-Nine!
Nine-Nine!

222
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:49,715
- Ah, there they are—
prong one,

223
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,456
my most important prong.

224
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:53,676
- Oh, thank you. Nice of you
to finally recognize

225
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,025
what our prong brings to this.

226
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:58,768
- Life is a cruel prank played
on the living.

227
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,900
Death mocks us all.

228
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:04,687
Time to go tell me son
he'll be an orphan... again.

229
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,037
- So, yeah. Prong one
pretty much broke immediately.

230
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,865
I'm gonna call HR.
Get ahead of that butt.

231
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:13,434
- Here's where we stand.
The Blue Flu continues.

232
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:14,914
O'Sullivan and the union
won't budge

233
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,437
on their mouse-burrito demands.

234
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,744
Also, arrests are down.

235
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:20,877
Santiago, Jeffords, what
on earth happened yesterday?

236
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,314
- The new detectives
won't do anything I ask.

237
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:25,838
And I've had to work solo.
- Sorry.

238
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:28,972
I was feeling a little sick,
but I am much better now.

239
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,451
- You look like garbage.

240
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:32,323
Now, I know you're trying
to tough this out,

241
00:08:32,366 --> 00:08:34,368
but I've always believed
that true toughness

242
00:08:34,412 --> 00:08:36,588
means acknowledging
your own limitations.

243
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,808
It's okay, Terry. Go home.

244
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,071
- Thank you, sir.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

245
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:44,378
- I can't believe
he bought that drivel.

246
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,772
True toughness means
working through pain.

247
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:47,904
Everyone knows that.

248
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:49,775
Peralta, where are we
with the doctor?

249
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:51,777
- We're gonna tail him and see
if he contacts O'Sullivan.

250
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:53,910
- Smart. And, uh, what is going
on with Detective Boyle?

251
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:55,259
Is he okay?

252
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,087
- Oh, you mean why is he
face-deep in cheese?

253
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,611
Yeah, it's made from the milk
of a Balkan donkey

254
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:01,308
and apparently
it's quite expensive.

255
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:03,267
- Spent 12 thou on ass cheese.

256
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,703
- Also, he's pretending like

257
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:06,357
he doesn't know
what ass cheese sounds like.

258
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,793
- Are you sure
he should be working?

259
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,490
- His doctor said
there's nothing to worry about

260
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:10,883
until we get
the actual test results back.

261
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,667
And Charles said that work

262
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:14,191
is the only thing keeping him
from thinking about death.

263
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:16,628
- Coat's to keep me warm...

264
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:18,238
in my grave.

265
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,373
- I mean, he's not doing great.

266
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,941
- Oh, you guys still
have lunch together?

267
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:26,246
- Twice a day, every day.

268
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,682
- Look, I need help
figuring out

269
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,467
how to inspire these new guys.

270
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,034
What motivates you?

271
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:32,600
- Well, I'd do anything
to retire

272
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,907
and spend the rest of my days
with Hitchcock in Brazil.

273
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,343
- Huh. That's actually
pretty helpful.

274
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:37,823
- That's the dream—

275
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,564
Scully and me on the sex barge
I'm building.

276
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:41,174
- Okay.
Scully was already helpful.

277
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:42,262
You don't have to keep talking.

278
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,829
These are pedometers,

279
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:46,049
which will prove that you're
actually walking your beat.

280
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:49,443
But whoever gets
the most steps in

281
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:52,533
will receive
seven days of overtime.

282
00:09:52,577 --> 00:09:56,842
Therefore, you'll be one week
closer to retirement.

283
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:59,236
- And one week closer
to a couple's massage

284
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,455
with your best friend
on his sex barge.

285
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,330
- Sir, guess what.

286
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,680
- Lieutenant,
I thought you went home.

287
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:10,725
- I did, but some uniforms
heard that I called out sick,

288
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,727
and they assumed
I was joining the Blue Flu.

289
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:15,252
They invited me to a meeting
tomorrow to talk strategy.

290
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:16,819
- You could go record them

291
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,733
admitting that
they don't actually have mono.

292
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:21,040
That is, if you're up to it.
- Hell, yeah.

293
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,389
Terry's gonna tough it out.

294
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,957
Terry's also gonna drink
some raspberry leaf tea

295
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:27,438
that Sharon uses to help her
with menstrual cramps.

296
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:28,743
- Oh, looks like we're
adding a prong.

297
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:32,356
Operation Trident
is now Operation Fork.

298
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,358
- Isn't there a cooler word
than "fork"?

299
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,838
I mean,
something more like "trident."

300
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:37,883
- Oh, no, did everyone assume
I was trying to be cool?

301
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,667
Is that why things
are going so poorly?

302
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:41,713
Damn it,
I've got to call Peralta.

303
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:44,759
- No, Operation Fork
is definitely not cool.

304
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:46,631
Uh, yeah, things are
going good here.

305
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:47,893
We're just staking out
the doctor

306
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:49,764
and trying to keep
a low profile.

307
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:53,594
♪ And I'll be
your brightest— ♪

308
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:55,596
Sorry about that. Just had
a bit of a noisy neighbor.

309
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,120
- ♪ I'll be—

310
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:59,252
- You know what, sir?
We have another noisy neighbor.

311
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:00,906
I'm just gonna call you back.
Bye.

312
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,778
All right, Charles, I get it.
You're scared.

313
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:06,825
But sometimes it helps
to say our fears out loud.

314
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:08,261
You know, if you put words
to them,

315
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:09,480
it can take away
some of their powers.

316
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:11,090
So come on.

317
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:13,440
Stop bottling up those fears
and get them out in the open.

318
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,010
- Okay, well...

319
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,795
I'm scared
that whatever's in my testicle

320
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:22,928
has spread
and that I'm gonna die.

321
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:26,497
And then I'll never get
to see Nikolaj grow up.

322
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,804
And I won't know
what kind of man he becomes.

323
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:32,764
Also, my time with you
will be cut short.

324
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:35,810
No more stakeouts
or drinks after a long shift

325
00:11:35,854 --> 00:11:39,379
or midnight calls when you've
had a breakthrough in a case.

326
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:41,599
I've always had this image
of us in our 90s

327
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:44,819
hunting down criminals
at the retirement home.

328
00:11:44,863 --> 00:11:48,519
But I guess that was just
a dumb fantasy...

329
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:51,304
because soon
I won't be here anymore...

330
00:11:51,348 --> 00:11:52,827
because I'll be dead and gone

331
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,612
and you won't ever
see me again.

332
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,399
Jake, are you crying?
- No.

333
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,532
Yes.

334
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:06,145
- Diaz,
why the hush-hush meeting?

335
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:07,581
- Because in one minute,

336
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,061
you're gonna be showing me
your tramp stamp.

337
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,671
- I don't have a tramp stamp.
- Prove it.

338
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:13,109
Show me your lower back.

339
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,502
- Hmm. Seems I didn't know
what a tramp stamp was.

340
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:17,287
But I'm not gonna
show you anything

341
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,505
until you've solved the case.

342
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:19,985
- Surveillance footage
of McCaffery

343
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:21,639
entering a pet store
and buying a mouse

344
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:23,249
an hour before he found it
in his burrito.

345
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:25,164
- He set the whole thing up.

346
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,427
Diaz, you did it.

347
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:29,429
- And now...

348
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:30,996
my payment.

349
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,520
- Okay, O'Sullivan,
there's McCaffery

350
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:35,044
coming out
of Perdue Pet Supplies

351
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,350
with the mouse
that he put in the burrito.

352
00:12:37,394 --> 00:12:39,004
So there's no need
for tactical gear

353
00:12:39,048 --> 00:12:42,007
or a Never Forget Burrito
ribbon or any of that.

354
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:43,791
You need to call off
the Blue Flu.

355
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:45,532
- Are you crazy?
My guys are under attack.

356
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:47,186
- No, I just proved
that it wasn't an attack.

357
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,361
He faked it.

358
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:49,841
- Not that attack,
this attack—

359
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,582
the one where you call
a policeman a liar.

360
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,887
- He is a liar.

361
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:54,541
- Oh, dear, my God.
You just did it again.

362
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,065
Do you understand
the worst thing you could do

363
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,546
to another person
is to call that person a liar?

364
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,722
You hate cops. That's a fact.

365
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,159
- I-I-I just thought

366
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,770
the Blue Flu
was about a mouse in a burrito.

367
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,773
- Well, it was, but now it's
about you saying it wasn't.

368
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:10,340
- That doesn't make any sense.
- So you're calling me stupid?

369
00:13:10,383 --> 00:13:12,081
- That's not what I said!
- You're calling me a liar?

370
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,647
- I just don't know how to talk
to someone like you.

371
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,214
- Someone like me?

372
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,825
Wow.
That's racist.

373
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:21,481
- Oh, this is a very
frustrating conversation.

374
00:13:23,614 --> 00:13:25,355
- The union can't
be reasoned with.

375
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:27,052
I need an update.
Prong one?

376
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,401
- More broken than ever.

377
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:30,229
- Ah, well, I never had
any faith in you anyway.

378
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:32,057
Santiago,
how's prong two doing?

379
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:33,102
- We're killing it.

380
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,277
According to the pedometers

381
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,626
I put
on the Hitchcock-and-Scullys,

382
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:36,888
they're out walking their beat.

383
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,020
And it's all thanks
to these guys.

384
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:39,151
- Hey.
- Screw you, Amy.

385
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,066
- No, I was complimenting you.

386
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,286
- Well, screw you anyway.
- Yeah.

387
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:45,331
- As for prong four, Jeffords
is recording

388
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,681
the officers' secret meeting
as we speak.

389
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:50,162
And I expect he'll be bursting
into my office any minute

390
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:52,512
with the proof
we need to end the Blue Flu.

391
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:56,299
- I got the proof we need
to end the Blue Flu.

392
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:57,952
- Wait, really?
- Why so surprised?

393
00:13:57,996 --> 00:13:59,476
That was the plan.

394
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,304
- Yes, but earlier,
I was talking to the squad,

395
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,175
and I put a lot of pressure
on this moment,

396
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:04,568
which I then regretted.

397
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,744
I feared I might be hoist
on my own petard.

398
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:08,354
- No petard hoisting here.

399
00:14:08,398 --> 00:14:10,052
They talked about everything
in front of me—

400
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,444
how they planned
the whole thing,

401
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:13,142
how long they were gonna
pretend to be sick.

402
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,144
- And you recorded it all,
despite your own illness.

403
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,059
I must say, I'm impressed.

404
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:18,582
- Because of how tough
I am, right?

405
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,540
- The toughest.

406
00:14:20,584 --> 00:14:22,890
- Okay, first things first.
We got to get—

407
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:26,068
- What—what is that?

408
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:27,504
- I had the mic close
to my chest.

409
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:30,202
So I guess it must have picked
up my stomach noises,

410
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:32,074
but I'm sure
it stops eventually.

411
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:37,122
More stomach.

412
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,558
It's all stomach.

413
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:39,951
- And there it is...

414
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,474
the petard.

415
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:44,303
- I need your help.
Our arrests are still way down.

416
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:45,783
But according to
the pedometers,

417
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:47,132
our Hitchcock-and-Scullys

418
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:48,916
are out there logging miles
on the beat.

419
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,222
How are they not seeing crimes?

420
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,745
- How do you know
they're walking?

421
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,138
- I just told you—

422
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,661
their pedometer numbers
are through the roof.

423
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,359
- Oh, poor, simple Amy.

424
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:58,404
It's like you've ever had
to mess with a medical device

425
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:01,059
in order to trick
your life insurance agent.

426
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,105
Watch and learn.

427
00:15:03,148 --> 00:15:04,410
- They're just using

428
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:06,151
the massage chairs
to jiggle their pedometers.

429
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:07,935
- Life always finds a way.

430
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:10,547
- To do what?
- To do nothing.

431
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,898
- Dr. Mintleman's just
working his normal job

432
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,508
and not being a criminal.

433
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,771
I can't believe this is
how I'm spending my final days.

434
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:19,425
- Maybe it doesn't have to be.
Screw this case.

435
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:21,123
What's something
you've always wanted to do?

436
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,428
Do you have a bucket list?

437
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:23,995
- Well, yeah, but, I mean,
it's only one item.

438
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,257
- Great.
Whatever it is, we're doing it.

439
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:27,172
- Live to be 110.
- Come on!

440
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:28,521
- I thought I found a loophole!

441
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,175
Okay, how about this?

442
00:15:30,219 --> 00:15:32,003
We go on
a cross-country road trip—

443
00:15:32,046 --> 00:15:34,136
me on a motorcycle,
you in my sidecar?

444
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:35,746
Or we enter
a cooking competition,

445
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,444
and you "Ratatouille" me from
inside of a giant chef's hat?

446
00:15:38,488 --> 00:15:40,664
I track down Diane Wiest,

447
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,405
and you finally try
and use your hall pass?

448
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:45,016
You're smiling,
so I guess that one's it.

449
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:47,453
Oof, going with Wiest, huh?
I got to be honest, Boyle—

450
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:48,933
I'm not so sure
you can pull that off.

451
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:50,152
I mean, her career is red hot.

452
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:51,544
She just did a movie
with Streep.

453
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:53,198
- No, Jake.
That's not why I'm smiling.

454
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:55,635
I'm smiling
because you know me so well.

455
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,029
- Yeah, we're best friends.
Of course I know you.

456
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,379
Well, as perfect
as all your ideas were,

457
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,642
nothing tops sitting here
with my best friend.

458
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:04,949
I mean, why would I want to go
to town on Diane Wiest

459
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,995
when I can go to town with you?

460
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,301
- What?

461
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:10,998
- Hang out.
Go to town with each other.

462
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,304
It's a common
friendship phrase.

463
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:13,653
- Haven't heard it.

464
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:14,872
- Oh.

465
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:17,135
Oh, God.
It's my biopsy results.

466
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:18,310
- What does it say?
- I don't know.

467
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:20,051
I'm too nervous.
I can't read it.

468
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:23,228
- It's not cancer.
- Not cancer.

469
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:25,230
- It's an infection,
and it's highly treatable.

470
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:27,014
- I'm not gonna die?
- You're not gonna die!

471
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,625
- Oh, we got to celebrate.

472
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,627
Does it say if it's safe to
ride a two-person banana boat?

473
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,846
- I don't know. Let me check.
It doesn't say.

474
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,978
- Oh, well...

475
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:35,675
- And also,
I think just figured out

476
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:38,461
how all those officers
got their fake diagnoses.

477
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:39,897
Tell us what's written there.

478
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,115
- Patient's left teste

479
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,987
is gnarled
and shows discoloration.

480
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,336
- No, not that.
There, at the top.

481
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,208
- ShareChem Medical Laboratory.
Yeah, so?

482
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,818
- So we thought it was
the doctor handing out

483
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:49,298
fake diagnoses, but he's clean.

484
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,256
However, the officers knew you
used ShareChem Lab,

485
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,345
and that lab is owned
by David Share,

486
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:56,261
brother of Nine-Nine officer
Michael Share.

487
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:58,350
- The lab faked
the blood results.

488
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,526
None of the officers
are actually sick,

489
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,354
which means they have no excuse
to miss work.

490
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:03,616
- Well, unfortunately,
that is—

491
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,401
- Stop. I know you're gonna
twist my words

492
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,968
into some vicious attack
on you and the NYPD.

493
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:09,579
So, before you do that,

494
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:11,494
I'd like the pleasure of making
the vicious attack myself.

495
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:13,017
- Sir, your insults
are kind of known

496
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,019
to be little too think-y,
maybe you should just let—

497
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,891
- O'Sullivan,
you are a [bleep],

498
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:22,287
and I hope your get
shoved right into your

499
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:24,463
- Wow. Well, that was
definitely not too think-y.

500
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:26,422
- Okay, okay, okay.
You got me.

501
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,293
The men didn't have mono.
They weren't sick.

502
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:29,729
- Damn right.
- But they are now.

503
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:31,209
- What?

504
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:32,863
- It seems they had a meeting,
and somebody showed up

505
00:17:32,906 --> 00:17:35,039
with a very bad stomach bug
and gave it to everyone there.

506
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:39,086
I believe the officer's name
was a, uh, Lieutenant Jeffords.

507
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,914
- The petard.

508
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:44,266
It just won't stop hoisting.

509
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,966
- Hey there, sir. You missed
the morning briefing.

510
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,533
And I see you found
Charles' cheese.

511
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:52,883
- Mmm, it pairs well
with despair

512
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:56,539
and also this 1976
Chateau Haut-Brion.

513
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:59,193
- Doesn't seem like the kind of
bottle you're supposed to chug.

514
00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:01,021
- I bought it
the day I joined the force

515
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,980
with the intent to open it
when I became commissioner.

516
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:04,547
- Oh, my gosh,
this is big news.

517
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,939
Congratulations, sir.

518
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:08,246
- No, he's not becoming
commissioner, Scully.

519
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,422
- We can still fight
the Blue Flu.

520
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,119
- It's over, Lieutenant.

521
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:14,557
I have to cave
to O'Sullivan's demands.

522
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,036
- Sir, you can't give up

523
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,516
on all your hard work
because of one setback.

524
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,039
- I'm a realist.

525
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,694
I knew I wouldn't be able
to fix every problem,

526
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:25,045
though I always imagined
I could fix some of them.

527
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,919
But as a realist, I can now see
I haven't fixed a damn thing.

528
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:31,704
The NYPD will never change.

529
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:33,967
- Sir, if I may—
when I thought I was dying,

530
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:36,492
all I could think about
was what a disappointment

531
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:37,928
my life had been.

532
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:39,712
But then Jake
went to town with me.

533
00:18:39,756 --> 00:18:41,192
- Common friendship phrase.

534
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:43,455
- And it helped me realize
you can't focus

535
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,196
on the things you didn't do.

536
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:46,937
Focus on what you did do.

537
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,070
And, more importantly,
focus on who you did it with.

538
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:52,725
- Boyle, you're
absolutely right.

539
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,640
- I am? My speech turned
your life around?

540
00:18:54,684 --> 00:18:56,599
- No, I found it trite
and uninspiring,

541
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,078
but something you said
resonated.

542
00:18:58,122 --> 00:19:00,907
Focus on the things
you didn't do.

543
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:02,648
- I said not to focus
on the things you didn't do.

544
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:03,954
- Again, your speech
meant nothing.

545
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:05,956
I'm just picking out
individual words.

546
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,785
- Sure, sure, yeah.
- Hot damn.

547
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,787
I know how to end the Blue Flu.

548
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,093
I found a fifth prong.

549
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:15,618
- So I gather you're ready
to cave to my demands.

550
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:16,880
- Why would I do that?
- Give me a break.

551
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,098
Your arrests are way down,

552
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:19,578
and your CompStat numbers
are terrible.

553
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:21,319
- I think those numbers
look great.

554
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,234
- No, you don't.
- Well, not those numbers.

555
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,105
Obviously, they make it look
like we haven't done much

556
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:26,237
at all this week.

557
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,021
But a friend of mine told me
something

558
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,372
unintentionally interesting—
focus on what you didn't do.

559
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:32,939
So here's what
we didn't do this week.

560
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,333
With fewer officers
at our disposal

561
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,944
and none of them trying
to hit CompStat numbers,

562
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,990
we made fewer bad arrests.

563
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:43,080
Number of complaints
against officers, down 32%.

564
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:45,125
Number of cases thrown out
at arraignment

565
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:47,301
for insufficient evidence,
down 34%.

566
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:49,869
And here's the most
important thing we didn't do.

567
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:52,132
We didn't make
the community less safe.

568
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:54,004
Rates of major
and violent crime,

569
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:55,658
what actually matters,
stayed the same.

570
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,268
- What are you saying?

571
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,618
- I'm saying the Nine-Nine
just became a case study

572
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:00,924
for how a police force

573
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,926
can work better
with fewer police.

574
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,928
- Are you actually talking
about laying off cops?

575
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,582
- If these numbers persist,
I may have no choice.

576
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,931
- Then I'll just end
the Blue Flu.

577
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,236
- Great. That's what I want.

578
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,803
- Then I won't end
the Blue Flu.

579
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:12,457
- Great. Fewer cops.
That's what I want.

580
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,416
- You just said that—

581
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:19,029
This is a very frustrating
conversation.

582
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:20,552
- I'd like
to officially announce

583
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:22,206
that the Blue Flu is over.

584
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:24,208
The uniformed officers
are at work,

585
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,992
and we sent
the Hitchcock-and-Scullys

586
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:27,341
back to their home precincts.

587
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:28,821
- So everything's back
to normal?

588
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:30,170
- No, the opposite.

589
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:32,042
We're gonna use
what we learned this week

590
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:33,870
to change the way
the NYPD polices our streets.

591
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,611
- Okay, awesome.
Very inspiring.

592
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:37,003
Now, on to
more important things.

593
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:40,964
I have obtained from Rosa
a photograph...

594
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,792
of Captain Holt's tattoo.

595
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:44,228
Oh.

596
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,143
I'm sorry, Captain, but there's
nothing you can do

597
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:47,492
that will stop me
from revealing

598
00:20:47,536 --> 00:20:52,497
that your secret
and embarrassing tattoo is...

599
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,412
a dot?
- Huh?

600
00:20:54,456 --> 00:20:56,501
- It's a decimal point.

601
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:59,156
Ah, what a first-thought
mathematical symbol.

602
00:20:59,199 --> 00:21:02,333
Might as well have gotten a
greater-than or equal-to sign.

603
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:04,640
- I can't believe I spent
$2,000 on a dot.

604
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:06,380
- You did?
- I know, Amy!

605
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:08,557
We're both upset
about the same thing!

606
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,993
I got to call Rosa.

607
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,826
- Thank you for giving Peralta
the doctored photo.

608
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:18,523
- My allegiances are
to the highest bidder.

609
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,046
- And you'll never tell anyone
what you saw?

610
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,483
- They wouldn't believe me
if I did.

611
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,180
I mean, come on, sir.
It's a picture of—

612
00:21:23,223 --> 00:21:25,269
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
