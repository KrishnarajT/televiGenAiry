1
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:09,034
- Good morning, Cousin Tommy.
I love you.

2
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:11,428
- Good morning, Cousin Mel.
I love you.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,389
Good morning, Cousin Sam.
I love you.

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:20,306
- Good morning, Cousin Tommy.
I love you.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,917
Good morning, Cousin Becca.
I love you.

6
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,748
- Good morning, Cousin Sam.
I love you.

7
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:30,577
Good morning, Pappy Boyle.
I love you.

8
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:34,277
- Good morning, Becca.
I love you.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,801
- Ooh, extra-long hug.

10
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:40,370
What got into you
this morning, Pappy?

11
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:42,807
Pappy?

12
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,376
Pappy!

13
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:59,998
♪

14
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:11,314
- Oh, Charles.

15
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:13,141
I'm so sorry
about your great-uncle Pappy.

16
00:01:13,185 --> 00:01:14,186
You holding up okay?

17
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,230
- I've been managing.

18
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:16,362
- Mm...
Have you though?

19
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:17,885
- Number two, step up.
Say, "Charles,

20
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:19,626
it's Pappy.
I'll always love you."

21
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,454
- Okay.
Uh, "Charles, it's Pappy.

22
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,716
I'll always love you."

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,544
- Then why did
you leave me?

24
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:26,416
Anyway, thanks for coming
with me to the funeral.

25
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,634
I think we're all packed.

26
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:28,853
I just got
to go grab the coffin.

27
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,289
- Wait, why are you
bringing the coffin?

28
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,465
- I brought a coffin
to my nana's funeral on a whim,

29
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,640
and it was a big hit.

30
00:01:33,684 --> 00:01:36,469
So now, guess who's
the coffin cousin?

31
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,818
- Got to say, Terry,

32
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:39,037
I'm a little surprised you're
coming to this.

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,604
- Honestly, I need a break
from the kids.

34
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:42,562
Cagney and Lacey keep trying
to trick me into falling

35
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:44,042
down the stairs on TikTok.

36
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:45,826
Terry can't
sprain another ankle.

37
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,393
- Well, I, for one, am pumped
to be going.

38
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:49,003
- To a funeral?
- I'm so bored, Terry.

39
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:50,744
I've been suspended
for 87 days.

40
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:52,137
Mac gets dropped off
at day care,

41
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,095
and I just sit at home
playing "Animal Crossing."

42
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,010
But no one will buy
my bugs or fossils.

43
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:58,099
I'm desperate for some
normal human interaction.

44
00:01:58,143 --> 00:02:00,406
- Coffin delivery!

45
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,625
- Okay, fine.
It doesn't have to be

46
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:03,844
normal or human.
Any interaction will work.

47
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:05,498
- Yo.
You forgot your lunch.

48
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,108
- Oh.
Thank you, Diaz.

49
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:08,849
- Sir, I didn't realize you
were still staying at Rosa's.

50
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,329
I thought couple's counseling
was going well.

51
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:11,591
- Not anymore.

52
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:12,636
At Kevin's request,
I offered to reduce

53
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,377
my work hours by 26%.

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,639
Kevin countered with 50.

55
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:16,944
Which I countered with 30.

56
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:18,119
Then Kevin says 40—

57
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:19,686
- Seems like a lot
of math for therapy.

58
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,514
- That's what
Dr. Cheryl said...

59
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,516
which is why we fired her,

60
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,170
and now we're working
with Dr. Ramanujan.

61
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:28,086
He's a physicist with a nice,
concrete worldview.

62
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:30,610
Anyway, Kevin refuses
to budge from 36%.

63
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:33,221
And I'm starting to worry
that I might lose to him.

64
00:02:33,265 --> 00:02:34,397
- You mean lose him.

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,615
- No.
Lose to him.

66
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,835
Therapy is a chess match.

67
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:38,966
And...

68
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,098
I will prevail.

69
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,753
- Or it's about saving
your marriage.

70
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,885
You should make
a grand romantic gesture.

71
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:46,713
- Ugh, so dumb.
- Seriously?

72
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:48,367
From the woman who
loves Nancy Meyers movies?

73
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,542
- Yeah.

74
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,022
Here's what
I've learned as a PI.

75
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:52,763
People suck, everyone cheats,
and love is an illusion.

76
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,678
Nancy Meyers is a fool,
and Holt should start dating.

77
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:55,853
What?
- You heard me.

78
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,637
It's the only way
you're gonna beat Kevin.

79
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:00,074
- I'm thinking about it.
I'm considering it,

80
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:02,729
and I've decided.

81
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,252
I'm in.

82
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:05,340
- Here it is.

83
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,951
Pappy Boyle's farm.

84
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:08,953
I spent every summer
here as a kid.

85
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:10,781
- Got to say, it's
nicer than I was expecting.

86
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:11,999
- Pappy did well
for himself.

87
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,566
He went to
business school in New York.

88
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,959
He got a job
in Wall Street.

89
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:16,787
And one day his hand
got caught in a subway door.

90
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,050
And he was dragged
from Times Square into Queens.

91
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,399
Largest settlement
in city history.

92
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:21,748
- Ew.

93
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,837
Pappy should've used
that cash on pest control.

94
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:25,491
There's giant rats everywhere.

95
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:27,145
- Those are nutria, Terry.

96
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:28,146
They're nothing like rats.

97
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:29,147
They have meatier haunches,

98
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,453
and their teeth
are more orange.

99
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:32,585
You know, nutria
are actually great pets.

100
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,847
They're affectionate
and smart.

101
00:03:33,891 --> 00:03:35,109
They know how
to open doors.

102
00:03:35,153 --> 00:03:36,023
Plus, you can milk them.

103
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,068
- But...

104
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:37,895
should you?

105
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:38,983
- Pappy drank nutria milk,

106
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:40,071
and he was fit
as a fiddle.

107
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:41,507
Anyway, you got
to see the house.

108
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:44,423
I can't wait to show you
the rug I was born on.

109
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,816
- Sure it's been
cleaned since then.

110
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,861
- Charles Boyle,
I love you.

111
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:50,473
- Sam Boyle,
I love you.

112
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:57,741
Where's that dead body?

113
00:03:57,784 --> 00:04:00,134
- He's in the barn,
and he looks adorable.

114
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,222
- Ah, terrific.

115
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:02,267
And everything's set
for the funeral?

116
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,398
- There's one little issue.

117
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:04,965
We can't find Pappy's will.

118
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,358
- What?
- He wanted to leave the farm

119
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,490
to the Council of Cousins,

120
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:08,534
but if we don't
find those papers,

121
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:09,883
it goes to Cousin Lyndon.

122
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,015
- Oh, no.

123
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:12,625
- Who's Cousin Lyndon?
- Pappy's son.

124
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,844
He's the black sheep
of the family.

125
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,802
- Wait, so we have
a wealthy patriarch

126
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:17,891
who mysteriously died,
a missing will,

127
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:20,241
and a black sheep set
to inherit everything?

128
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,939
Am I the only one
who suspects foul play here?

129
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:24,637
- He didn't die mysteriously.
He was 93.

130
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,812
- He was fit as fiddle, Terr.

131
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:27,292
From all the nutria milk.

132
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:28,380
- Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:29,686
No Boyle would
ever commit murder.

134
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,339
Boyles don't even
get mad at each other.

135
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:34,212
Except in that rare instance
of cousin-on-cousin jealousy.

136
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:35,822
- You're just bored
from your suspension

137
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:37,258
and desperate
to find a case to work.

138
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:38,651
- No.
That's not it.

139
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,826
I'm just telling you,

140
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,698
something doesn't
smell right here.

141
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,177
- Oh, yeah.
That's Pappy's body.

142
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:44,875
Cousin Mel did
the embalming in here,

143
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:47,225
and I think she forgot
to add something.

144
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:48,356
- Well...

145
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,271
that's a disturbing revelation.

146
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:53,579
- Hey.
What's going on?

147
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:54,841
- I'm helping Holt
pick a dating site.

148
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:56,147
- Oh, this looks good.

149
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,409
- PhDs only.

150
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:58,715
- Uh, actually
in this context,

151
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:00,978
PHD stands for
Pretty Huge

152
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:02,588
- Oh, my.

153
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:05,025
I can only assume that MDs only
stands for Medium

154
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:06,418
- Rosa, can I talk
to you for a second?

155
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:07,854
What the hell are you doing?

156
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:10,030
Why are you trying to get Holt
and Kevin to break up?

157
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:11,771
- I'm trying to get Holt
and Kevin back together.

158
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,556
He and Kevin are perfect
for each other.

159
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,818
He just needs
to realize that.

160
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,341
Once he sees what other
trash is out there,

161
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,561
he's gonna go running straight
back into Kevin's arms,

162
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:20,214
just like
in a Nancy Meyers movie.

163
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:21,651
- So you still love
Nancy Meyers?

164
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:23,391
- I will never turn my back
on Nancy Meyers.

165
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:24,784
- Okay.
I'm in.

166
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:27,613
Let operation
"Lucky Number Kevin" begin.

167
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:28,614
- I'm out.
- No, no, no.

168
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:29,963
We don't have
to call it that.

169
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:31,965
- Okay, then I'll think
I'll finish up by saying

170
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,228
Pappy Boyle
was the best hugger.

171
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:36,579
Which is surprising because
he lost his hand in the subway.

172
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:40,452
But he always said,
"You don't hug with your hands,

173
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,323
"you hug with your heart.

174
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,674
And your groin."
He got that groin involved.

175
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:47,154
- Uh, a lot of groin talk
for a eulogy.

176
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:48,503
- Everyone,

177
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,418
there's something you need
to see in the barn.

178
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:51,681
The game...

179
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:52,899
is afoot.

180
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,901
- Pappy Boyle was 93.

181
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:56,511
Who would've suspected
that his death stemmed

182
00:05:56,555 --> 00:05:59,036
from anything other than the
cruel embrace of Father Time?

183
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,212
To suggest as much
might get someone labeled

184
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:02,517
a crackpot, a kook,

185
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,694
someone that's
"bored with their suspension."

186
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:06,478
- Can you cut the
"Harriet The Spy" windup?

187
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:07,958
It stinks in here.

188
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,569
- What you're smelling, Terry,
is duplicity and deceit.

189
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,179
- I think it's
actually Pappy's organs.

190
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,746
- Sam, you're kind of messing
with my flow right now.

191
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,748
Point is, I was examining
the body,

192
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,837
and I found something.

193
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:21,014
Classic ulceration
and desquamation of the mouth.

194
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:23,451
Telltale signs
of poisoning.

195
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,976
- In other words...

196
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,587
What we have ourselves here

197
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:31,851
is a good
ol' fashioned murder...

198
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,723
- Oh, no.

199
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:35,202
- Of a man
who you all loved dearly.

200
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:36,421
I shouldn't have done
the "Knives Out" accent.

201
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:40,860
- All right.
A man has been poisoned,

202
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:42,296
his will is missing,

203
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,254
and there's only one person
who stands to profit.

204
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:44,429
Lyndon Boyle.

205
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:45,865
- Lyndon's not a killer.

206
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,650
- I mean, he did skip a Boyle
family Zoom last summer.

207
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:48,694
- Yeah, it's true.

208
00:06:48,738 --> 00:06:49,869
It's seven hours out
of your day.

209
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:51,175
How hard is that to fit in?

210
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:53,394
- Okay, let's set up
an interrogation room.

211
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:55,962
I wanna make this guy as
uncomfortable as possible.

212
00:06:57,703 --> 00:06:58,965
I thought we were going
for uncomfortable.

213
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:00,271
What's with the rocking chair?

214
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:02,142
- It's a farm.
All the chairs are rockers.

215
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:04,449
But don't worry,
I under-steeped the tea.

216
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,712
- Ugh.
It's so weak.

217
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:08,279
Why am I being treated
like a criminal?

218
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:09,497
- Okay.
I stand corrected.

219
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,456
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

220
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,545
Tell us about your last contact
with your father.

221
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:14,720
- Pappy?

222
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:15,721
Well, I saw him
at his birthday party.

223
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,940
- Mm-hmm.
And was there anything

224
00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:17,941
unusual about that night?

225
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,116
- Nothing unusual at all.

226
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:20,770
We ate a pig
from snout to anus,

227
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:23,250
and then took turns giving
each other head massages.

228
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:25,296
I was tired.
So I found Pappy,

229
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:26,558
wished him a happy birthday.

230
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:28,212
We hugged
for six minutes.

231
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,953
It was the last time
I saw him alive.

232
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,130
- Did you see those tears?

233
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:34,131
No way he did it.

234
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:35,175
- Are you serious?

235
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,524
Anyone can fake cry.

236
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:38,004
You just have
to think of something sad.

237
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:39,963
Like that episode of
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"

238
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,007
when Leonardo was in a coma.

239
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:41,965
- And that works?

240
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:43,009
- Yeah.

241
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:44,358
Yeah, it does.

242
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:45,664
Now, come on.

243
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,187
Let's go poke some holes
in Lyndon's story.

244
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:50,451
- It was such a great party.
Everyone had the best time.

245
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:51,496
I mean, except for Lyndon.

246
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:52,497
- Lyndon wasn't happy?

247
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,759
- Yeah, it was strange.

248
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:55,369
He was passing
through the living room.

249
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,545
I asked him
if he wanted a little HJ.

250
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:58,895
But he just ignored me.

251
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:01,201
I mean, who doesn't want
an HJ from their cousin?

252
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:02,550
- Hold up.
An HJ?

253
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:04,770
- A head job.
A massage.

254
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:06,032
Isn't that what
everyone calls it?

255
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:07,207
- You bet.
- Absolutely not.

256
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,861
- Okay, so why
was Lyndon angry?

257
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,255
- I bet it was whatever
Pappy said to him.

258
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:12,473
- Wait.
What Pappy said when?

259
00:08:12,517 --> 00:08:13,561
- When they were
in Pappy's study.

260
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:14,911
We heard raised voices.

261
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,521
And then Lyndon said...
- Good night.

262
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:17,696
- Walked out of the room,

263
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,176
and closed the door
behind him.

264
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:20,960
- That's all he said?
Good night?

265
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:22,788
Gentlemen...

266
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:24,834
I just solved this case.

267
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,532
- Sir, if you wanna get a date
off of these sites,

268
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,881
you're gonna have
to give me a little more

269
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,056
from your profile photo.

270
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,406
- I just gave you
a series of eight poses,

271
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,018
each increasing
in sexual provocativeness

272
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,193
by one-eighth.

273
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:37,803
If you wanted septiles
or deciles

274
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,457
of sexiness,
you should've told me.

275
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,198
- What?

276
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,547
Why do you care
so much, Santiago?

277
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,853
I thought you didn't like
the idea of me dating.

278
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:45,028
- Yes, initially.

279
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,552
But then I thought
about your metaphor

280
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,336
about how relationships
are like a chess match.

281
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,208
- Mm-hmm.
- And it really convinced me.

282
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:52,513
- That was
a strong observation.

283
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:55,255
- So why don't you think
of this profile photo

284
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,475
as an epic chess move?

285
00:08:57,518 --> 00:09:01,348
- Like Vladimirov's
Thunderbolt of 1987.

286
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:02,697
Close the door, Diaz.

287
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:05,657
I'm removing my collar stays.

288
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,876
- Why am I back here?

289
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,269
Like I told you,
it was a typical night.

290
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:10,618
- Right.
Cousin kissing circle,

291
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:12,055
everyone gets burped
after dinner—

292
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:13,230
normal stuff.

293
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:14,187
But let's talk about
what happened

294
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:15,972
after the burping,
shall we?

295
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,277
- What are you getting at?

296
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:18,365
What exactly do you think
happened that night?

297
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:19,976
- I'm so glad you asked.

298
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,587
I think Pappy called you
into his study

299
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,415
and told you he was cutting
you out of his will.

300
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,591
Tempers flared.
Voices were raised.

301
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:27,766
- What?
- You were furious

302
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,854
you wouldn't
be inheriting the farm.

303
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:29,986
- I don't even
want the farm.

304
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,988
I've always been more
of a city boy.

305
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,293
I live in Poughkeepsie.

306
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:34,425
- Well, I guess
that settles it.

307
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,907
- Except you didn't
say I love you.

308
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,038
- Excuse me?

309
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:40,170
- When you left,
you said "good night."

310
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,693
You didn't say
"I love you."

311
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,303
Now, you may be a black sheep,
but you're still a Boyle.

312
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:44,783
And a Boyle always says
"I love you."

313
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:46,263
- Not always.
- Look around you.

314
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,786
It's written everywhere.

315
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,269
- Okay, fine.
We were fighting.

316
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:53,923
But not over the will.

317
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:55,925
Pappy was mad at me for missing
that Zoom call this summer.

318
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:58,144
- I mean honestly, Lyndon, what
did you expect would happen?

319
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,364
- He said I was a disgrace
to the Boyle name.

320
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:01,756
So I didn't say "I love you."

321
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,323
I just stormed out
to the shed.

322
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,282
I went to get
the Grandmother Dough.

323
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:06,936
- The Grandmother Dough?

324
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:08,198
- Here it is.

325
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,157
The original Boyle family
sourdough starter,

326
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,942
the mother
of the mother dough.

327
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:14,552
It's still good,
but the lid on the jar

328
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:16,206
has been stuck
for over a hundred years.

329
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,905
- There's an old family legend
that it can only be opened by

330
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:21,733
The One True Boyle.

331
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:22,908
- I wanted to show
my dad that I was

332
00:10:22,952 --> 00:10:24,301
not a disgrace
to the family.

333
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:25,345
But I couldn't budge it.

334
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:26,390
Maybe he was right.

335
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,087
- Oh, Lyndon.
What a tale.

336
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:31,003
But I don't think that's why
you came in this barn at all.

337
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,135
I think you came in here

338
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,266
for this.

339
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,485
- Is that nutria poison?

340
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:36,966
- It's rat poison.
Nutria are pets.

341
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,228
You psychopath.

342
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,969
- Ah.
Nitrobenzene.

343
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:41,840
That causes the exact type
of ulcers

344
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:43,755
we found
in Pappy Boyle's mouth.

345
00:10:43,798 --> 00:10:46,671
And look what we have here.

346
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:49,630
A single brown hair,

347
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:51,241
belonging to the murderer.

348
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,547
Terry, please send this off
to the local police station

349
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:54,940
for a DNA test.

350
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:58,074
Now all we need is one
of your hairs, Lyndon.

351
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:59,249
- I didn't kill my father.

352
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,511
Why am I being singled out?

353
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:01,947
- Why not take a hair
from every Boyle

354
00:11:01,991 --> 00:11:03,688
so Cousin Lyndon
doesn't feel that way?

355
00:11:03,731 --> 00:11:05,342
- Sure, great idea.
I'll go first.

356
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:07,300
- I mean it's more work for the
lab, but it's fine with me.

357
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,737
Are you okay
with that, Lyndon?

358
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:11,174
- Oh, wow.
Went with a nose hair.

359
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:12,262
Didn't see
that coming.

360
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:13,480
But it's definitely
long enough.

361
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:15,526
- No.

362
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:17,049
- Okay, sir.
This app's pretty simple.

363
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,877
If you don't like the guy's
profile, you click "dang,"

364
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:20,531
and if you do,
you click "daaang."

365
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:21,662
- That sounds
needlessly confusing.

366
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:22,620
- Why?
"dang" is bad

367
00:11:22,663 --> 00:11:23,664
and "daaang" is good.

368
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,579
- Okay, let's thin this herd.

369
00:11:25,623 --> 00:11:27,494
Untucked shirt,
no thank you.

370
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,019
Born in San Diego, yikes.

371
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,542
An adult named Todd?

372
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:34,023
So this is what
online dating is like?

373
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:35,285
I didn't realize.

374
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,547
- Realize how good
you have it with Kevin?

375
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,983
- No, how it hasn't changed.

376
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:40,290
You still have
to pick someone based on looks

377
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,378
and hope
for a connection later.

378
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:42,901
Oh, Lord, help me.

379
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:43,858
I'm going for it.

380
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:44,947
I'm clicking "dang."
- No.

381
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,513
"Dang" is bad.
Click "daaang."

382
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,298
- Why is this so confusing?

383
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,300
How do I get Hot Todd back?

384
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,389
- DNA results are in.

385
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:53,564
- Ooh, and?
Who did it?

386
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:54,521
It was Lyndon, right?

387
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,045
- Hair is...

388
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:57,394
"rodent in origin."

389
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,308
- What?
Doesn't make any sense.

390
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,352
Here, forward it to me.

391
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:00,614
- Must've been a nutria hair.

392
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:02,442
Those things are everywhere.
Ugh.

393
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:03,574
- Wait a minute.
This is weird.

394
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:05,054
According to the DNA results,

395
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,491
everyone in the Boyle family
is related except one.

396
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:08,448
- Lyndon?
- No.

397
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:09,797
- Charles.

398
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:12,104
- Charles Boyle

399
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,584
isn't a Boyle.

400
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,110
- That DNA test has
to be wrong.

401
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,330
I mean, Charles is the most
Boyle-y of all the Boyles.

402
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,896
- You know what?
I'm gonna call Charles' dad,

403
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,246
get to the bottom of this.

404
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,337
Hey, Lynn?
It's Jake.

405
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,078
Hi.
Hey, can I ask you

406
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:30,993
about Charles' paternity
real quick?

407
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,647
All right.
Thanks, Lynn. Bye.

408
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:35,040
- What on Earth
took so long?

409
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:36,389
- Well, the first five hours

410
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,522
was mostly just sobbing
and gasping for air.

411
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:41,307
Then he told me
that Charles' mom had an affair

412
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,787
with a rival florist.

413
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,397
Lynn always suspected
he might've been Charles' dad,

414
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:46,399
but he decided he loved him
so much, it didn't matter.

415
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:47,705
- I don't understand.

416
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:49,620
Charles looks just like all
the other Boyles.

417
00:12:49,663 --> 00:12:50,838
- Apparently that's
not genetic.

418
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:52,579
The Boyles cuddle
their children so much,

419
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:53,928
it shapes
their bones that way.

420
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:56,105
He likened it to how they
grow square watermelons.

421
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:57,280
- Oh, my God.

422
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:58,368
We can't tell Charles.

423
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,934
- You wanna lie
to our dear friend

424
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:01,632
about the one thing
that's most important to him

425
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:03,547
in the whole world?

426
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,114
- Yes.
- Okay, good, me too.

427
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:06,680
Now all we have to do is prove
that Cousin Lyndon is

428
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:09,292
the murderer before Charles
asks about the DNA results.

429
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:10,293
- Hi, guys.

430
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:11,642
- Ah.
Hey, man.

431
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:12,643
Where'd you come from?

432
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:13,992
- I slinked up.

433
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:15,124
- You know how good
Boyles are at slinking.

434
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:16,821
It's because
of our fleshy toe pads.

435
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,649
- Right.
And you, Charles,

436
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,651
have said fleshy toe pads

437
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:22,000
because you are a Boyle,

438
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:26,091
from snout to anus.

439
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:28,267
- "A Boyle from snout
to anus."

440
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:29,312
That is so sweet.

441
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,661
I'm stealing that
for the eulogy.

442
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:32,097
- Ah, you don't have to.

443
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:33,577
- Huh.

444
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,839
It's the exact time we agreed
to meet for our date,

445
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:35,796
and he's not here.

446
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,971
- I'm sorry.

447
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:38,408
I know how you
value punctuality.

448
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,539
- In my employees.

449
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:41,585
But in potential suitors,
I don't mind

450
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:42,890
one or two minutes
of tardiness.

451
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:44,849
I like a bad boy.

452
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,242
Now, if you'll excuse me,

453
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,505
I'm going to go to the bathroom
to wash my hands,

454
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:50,550
in case we shake.

455
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,726
- Ooh.

456
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,685
I thought the point was
for Holt to bail

457
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:55,860
before he got
to an actual date.

458
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,427
- It is.
But this works too.

459
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,037
I mean, did you see
the dude he matched with?

460
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,212
He calls himself a doctor,

461
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,996
but he's actually
a chiropractor.

462
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,477
- Are we sure Holt doesn't
respect chiropractors?

463
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:08,394
I'm kidding.

464
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:10,222
Ooh.
There's Todd.

465
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,572
- And here's Holt.

466
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:14,139
Started off strong,
nice big smile.

467
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:16,359
Oh, not anymore.
He just noticed Todd's loafers.

468
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:17,838
- Oh, Todd, you fool.

469
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:20,189
Holt thinks any shoes
without laces are flip-flops.

470
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:22,887
- Now the moment that will send
Holt running toward the exit.

471
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,845
When he asks Todd
what he would like to drink,

472
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:26,543
Todd orders,
"Whatever you're having."

473
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:29,763
- Oh Todd, you fool.
Have your own opinion.

474
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,201
Wait a second.
Are they gonna sit down?

475
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:33,289
In a booth?

476
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,333
Oh, no, Rosa.

477
00:14:34,377 --> 00:14:35,421
Todd's not the fool.

478
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:36,944
We're the fools.

479
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:39,121
- I have eyes on the package.

480
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:40,383
He's headed towards you.

481
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:41,645
- I'm on it.
- Seriously, guys,

482
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:42,776
why are we doing this?

483
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,430
We should just wait
for the DNA test.

484
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:45,692
- We will.

485
00:14:45,736 --> 00:14:46,824
But the lab said
it would take a week.

486
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,695
They had to get
a new tech.

487
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:50,088
- Oh, no.
Why?

488
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:53,396
The old one had
a bad allergic reaction to...

489
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,832
beakers.
- Ugh.

490
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,399
Labs are full of them.
That's awful.

491
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:57,835
- Yeah, and real.

492
00:14:57,878 --> 00:14:59,793
Anyways, since Lyndon
is our only actual suspect,

493
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:01,404
we might as well investigate.

494
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:02,666
- Let me ask you this.
Is he gushing?

495
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:03,884
- Don't say those words.

496
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:05,190
- The pressure
of keeping secrets

497
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,931
makes Boyles stress-sweat.

498
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,280
Once, we played Mafia,

499
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,630
and you'd never seen
so many dripping wet cousins

500
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:11,979
in one room.
- Come on.

501
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,677
- Wait.
He's leaving the property.

502
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,939
- Can you stay with him?

503
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,158
- Yeah.
I think so.

504
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:17,463
I just have to get
around the barn and—

505
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,423
- Terr-bear?

506
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,120
- I'm sorry.
I was following Lyndon

507
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:24,340
and I crawled
into that thing.

508
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:25,645
- That thing has a name.

509
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:26,907
- It's Muffin.

510
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:28,300
- Well, thanks to Muffin,
we lost Lyndon.

511
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,173
- Yes.
But also thanks to Muffin,

512
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:34,088
I just solved the case
of who killed Pappy Boyle.

513
00:15:34,132 --> 00:15:36,134
- We're right here.

514
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:38,267
- Yeah. I didn't think
it would feed back.

515
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,704
- Oh, no, Rosa.
They're leaving together.

516
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:41,661
What are we gonna do?

517
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:42,880
- We stop them.

518
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:43,924
Even if it means we have
to kill Todd.

519
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:46,405
- Smart.
Let's go.

520
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:47,319
- Looking for someone?

521
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,713
- Sir.
Uh, what's going on?

522
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:52,281
- What's going on is that you
were trying to manipulate me,

523
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:54,370
but it is I
who manipulated you.

524
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,501
How does it feel

525
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:58,417
to suckle from
your own tainted teat?

526
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,114
- Not as bad as it feels
to hear you say "suckle."

527
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,595
- So you were never really
going home with Todd?

528
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,555
- You actually think I would
have relations with him?

529
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,426
His watch has a cloth strap.

530
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,601
- I really thought
we had something.

531
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:10,429
- Wake up, Todd.
I'm out of your league.

532
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:12,910
You thought you could meddle
in my personal life,

533
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:15,782
but I was ten moves ahead
the whole time.

534
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:16,957
And now, checkmate.

535
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:18,176
- Ooh.
I love chess.

536
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,438
Have you seen
"The Queen's Gambit"?

537
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:21,832
It's a TV show.
- Todd, I swear to God.

538
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,530
- The person who killed Pappy
wasn't a person at all.

539
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:25,792
It was Muffin.

540
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:27,185
- I checked her mouth,

541
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:29,274
and Muffin had the same ulcers
that Pappy had.

542
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:31,624
Muffin ate the poison,
and then Pappy drank her milk.

543
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:33,539
- Charles, you said nutria
could open doors.

544
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,585
Muffin must've let herself
into the barn.

545
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,195
- Which explains why we found
her hair on the box.

546
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,979
- So Lyndon was innocent.

547
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:40,807
- Wait, how did you know
it was Muffin's hair?

548
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,287
Did you get
the DNA report back?

549
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:43,506
- Exactly.
- Wait, but I thought

550
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:44,855
the report was gonna
take a week

551
00:16:44,898 --> 00:16:46,030
because of
the lab tech's allergies.

552
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:47,336
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

553
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,120
But then they decided
to use a subcontractor

554
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:50,600
who was allergy-free,
so let's just move on

555
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,862
and talk about
something else immediately.

556
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,037
Three "uh-huh's"?

557
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,908
Clearly you're lying
about something.

558
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:56,040
- Why you being a jerk to me?

559
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,346
- Show me the report, Jake.

560
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,086
- Okay, fine.
But just look at the top result

561
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,306
'cause that's all
that matters.

562
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,047
"Specimen hair was rodent
in nature."

563
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,701
and that's that.

564
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:07,878
- Oh, my God.

565
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:09,401
I'm not a Boyle.

566
00:17:11,969 --> 00:17:14,101
- Okay.
I love you too, Dad.

567
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,277
Did you guys change clothes?

568
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,974
- Yeah, Charles.
It's tomorrow now.

569
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:18,715
You been on the phone
for 14 hours.

570
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:20,412
- Well, you know
what they say,

571
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,632
"Time flies when God
pulls down his pants

572
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,460
and takes a dump
on your life."

573
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,113
- Oh, buddy.
I'm so sorry.

574
00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:28,638
- Being a Boyle was
the backbone of my identity.

575
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,467
Without the Boyle backbone,
I'm just a bag of flesh.

576
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,425
I'm goo.
- Come on, you're not goo.

577
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,079
Being a Boyle is about more
than blood.

578
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,254
It's what's in your heart.

579
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:37,690
- Blood is what's in
your heart.

580
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:38,996
You're making it worse, Jake.

581
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,476
- Okay, fine.
Then what about Nikolaj?

582
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,825
He was adopted, so technically,

583
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,435
he's not a Boyle,
but that never bothered you.

584
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,828
- I didn't even think
about Niko.

585
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:47,091
He was already a Boyle
once removed

586
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,311
which is tough enough.
Now he's twice removed?

587
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:51,965
Twice-removed Boyles
are a total clown show,

588
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:55,447
okay?
Niko's basically Cousin Andrea.

589
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,362
Sorry, Andrea.

590
00:17:57,406 --> 00:17:59,799
- I know what I am.

591
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:01,497
- Well, damn.
- Look, let's go home.

592
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,368
- We're leaving?
What about the funeral?

593
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:04,500
What about the eulogy?

594
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:05,805
- I don't feel right
giving it now.

595
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,242
Sam offered to step in.
I'll have him do it.

596
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:09,722
- No, no, no.
Wait.

597
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,028
Assemble the cousins.

598
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,986
Today, we learned
that Pappy Boyle's death

599
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,118
was not foul play.

600
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,120
But even though
there was no murder,

601
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,469
there was a robbery.

602
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,124
Charles had his sense
of self stolen from him

603
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:21,430
by Sam Boyle.

604
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:23,083
You said it yourself, Charles,

605
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,390
the Boyles have a long history
of cousin-on-cousin jealousy.

606
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:28,088
Sam couldn't stand that you
were chosen to give the eulogy.

607
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:29,699
Think about it.

608
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:31,222
It was Sam who made sure we
knew the will was missing.

609
00:18:31,265 --> 00:18:33,529
- We can't find Pappy's will.

610
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:36,706
- Then Sam again who suggested
you all get your DNA tested.

611
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,012
- Why not take a hair
from every Boyle?

612
00:18:39,056 --> 00:18:41,841
- And finally, Sam who made
sure we all knew the results.

613
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:43,843
- Did you get
the DNA report back?

614
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:46,150
This is ridiculous.
I love Charles.

615
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,543
- Okay, well then.

616
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,805
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
giving him a hug then.

617
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:50,067
Since you love him so much.

618
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,331
- Sure.
I always like to hug my cousin.

619
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,898
- He's gushing!

620
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:55,812
- Darn it.

621
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:57,509
I thought these would hide it,

622
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,903
but I gushed
through my pit diapers.

623
00:18:59,946 --> 00:19:01,295
All right, fine.

624
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,602
I always suspected
that Charles wasn't one of us.

625
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:05,648
I mean, he went
through puberty at 13,

626
00:19:05,691 --> 00:19:07,258
instead of 25,

627
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:09,086
like a normal Boyle.

628
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:12,263
And when he got chosen
to give the eulogy,

629
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,091
something inside
of me snapped.

630
00:19:14,134 --> 00:19:15,440
So I hid the will.

631
00:19:15,484 --> 00:19:16,702
I admit it.

632
00:19:16,746 --> 00:19:17,747
Are you happy now?

633
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,009
- Very.
- Not at all.

634
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:20,880
- Wait, what?
Charles, we solved the case.

635
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:23,056
He confessed.
- Doesn't matter.

636
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,754
I'm still not a Boyle.

637
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:28,453
I'm just a normal person.

638
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:30,803
Normal from snout to anus.

639
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,765
- We wanted to apologize.

640
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,550
- And if you wanna gloat
about how you outsmarted us,

641
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,030
go ahead.
We deserve it.

642
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:41,814
- I won't be doing
any gloating.

643
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:43,816
I mean, I did last night.
I went home and had a drink

644
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,123
to toast to your humiliation.

645
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,211
But it didn't feel right,

646
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,386
because I had no one
to toast with,

647
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,779
no one to share my glee.

648
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:54,174
I had won,
but I was alone.

649
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:55,959
And I realized,

650
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:58,657
this is exactly what
I'm doing to Kevin.

651
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:01,051
Trying to win therapy.

652
00:20:01,094 --> 00:20:02,487
And it hit me.

653
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:06,491
I care so much about winning

654
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:09,886
that I've lost everything.

655
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:11,975
- Tell Kevin how you feel.

656
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:14,630
- It's raining.
You could run to him.

657
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,109
- This is the real world,
Santiago.

658
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:20,113
Relationships end
in unsatisfying ways every day.

659
00:20:20,157 --> 00:20:22,115
People don't run
to each other in the rain.

660
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,509
- Raymond!
Raymond Holt!

661
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:26,598
- Kevin?

662
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,123
- Raymond!

663
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:37,304
Raymond, am I too late?

664
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:38,654
- Too late?

665
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,090
- My friend saw
your dating profile

666
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:42,266
and your photo
without collar stays.

667
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,529
I thought I'd lost you.

668
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:47,576
- You will never lose me.

669
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,012
I'll do anything
to keep you.

670
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:51,231
I'll compromise on everything.

699
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,732
and I'm gonna be
even more humiliated.

700
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,995
- Just try.
I believe in you.

701
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:02,651
So did you loosen it?

702
00:22:02,694 --> 00:22:03,956
- I tried, but it's slippery,

703
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,914
and that thing
is sealed on tight.

704
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,393
I couldn't budge it.

705
00:22:06,437 --> 00:22:08,787
- Oh, no.
Uh, hey, Charles.

706
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,441
Remember when I said
that I believed in you?

707
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:11,660
- Yes.

708
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:12,617
It's the entire reason
I'm doing this.

709
00:22:12,661 --> 00:22:14,532
- Oh.
Godspeed.

710
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:28,198
♪

711
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:30,200
- Ah!

712
00:22:30,243 --> 00:22:31,070
I did it!

713
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:32,637
- He's The One True Boyle.

714
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,511
- Oh, my God.
What is that stench?

715
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:38,817
It's the Grandmother Dough.

716
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:39,949
- It smells horrible.

717
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:42,647
- Not to a Boyle.

718
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:45,955
Pappy's hugs were long
and firm.

719
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,304
- Okay, here's what I think
might've happened.

720
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:49,436
You loosened the jar,
but you didn't realize it

721
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,568
because you're a Godzilla man,

722
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:52,091
and you don't know
your own strength.

723
00:22:52,135 --> 00:22:53,789
- First of all, thank you
for calling me a Godzilla man.

724
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,268
- Yeah.
- Secondly, that's not it.

725
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:56,922
The jar was too slippery.
- All right, how about this?

726
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:58,707
Charles was so freaked out
about not being a Boyle

727
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,231
that he got an adrenaline rush,
and that made him stronger.

728
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:03,189
- Or maybe Charles
is the One True Boyle.

729
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:05,452
- And I know that Pappy's
up there

730
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:07,672
shopping for beige slacks

731
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:10,936
at that Mervyn's in the sky.

732
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,635
Ah, Mervyn's!

733
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:15,158
- Yeah, he's
the One True Boyle.

734
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:17,334
- Not a doctor.
Shh.

735
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:18,814
- Fremulon.
