176
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:19,910
But i'm not one of the bad ones

177
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,041
Who says they're one
of the good ones.

178
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:22,173
I'm actually
one of the good ones

179
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,566
Who says they're one
of the good ones.

180
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:24,567
And i know how that sounds—

181
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,611
- Does he just keep going

182
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:26,960
Until someone stops him?
Both: yes.

183
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:28,483
- Would you mind telling us
what happened

184
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:29,615
From the beginning?
- Sure.

185
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:30,921
I was walking home
from the pharmacy

186
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,575
When two uniformed cops
stopped me

187
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:33,793
And asked me
what was in my bag.

188
00:05:33,837 --> 00:05:35,665
I said nothing,
just some personal items.

189
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,840
But then they kept
bothering me, saying,

190
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,058
Well, if it's nothing,

191
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:39,320
I should have no problem
with showing them.

192
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:40,757
But in my mind
i'm like,

193
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,585
Why do i need
to show them my new loofah?

194
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:43,760
- You don't. It's your loofah.

195
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:46,632
- Thank you, ms. Diaz.
It is my loofah.

196
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:48,547
Anyways,
i said i wanted to go home,

197
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,897
So i tried to walk past them,
and they grabbed me.

198
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:52,377
Suddenly, i'm thrown
on the ground

199
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,118
And they're yelling at me
to stop resisting,

200
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,728
Which i wasn't.

201
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,295
I was just scared.

202
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:59,079
Then they threw me
up against the squad car,

203
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:01,038
Saying they was arresting me
for assaulting them.

204
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:02,474
I'm the one
who got the black eye

205
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:03,736
And bruises all over my body,

206
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,303
But somehow i assaulted them?

207
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:06,696
- Do you remember
what time of day it was?

208
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,611
- 5:45, 6:00.

209
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:10,090
- So right at the end
of a shift.

210
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:11,396
- Which means?
- Some officers

211
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,832
Like to make arrests
at the end of their shift

212
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,921
So they can work later
and get extra overtime.

213
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,010
- That is so wrong.
- It is.

214
00:06:17,054 --> 00:06:20,231
But i promise you,
we are gonna get you justice.

215
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:22,755
- Yeah, we'll see.

216
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,714
- Hey, did you find the book?

217
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:26,629
- Scully's book.

218
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:28,282
- Wow. Someone's in a mood.

219
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:30,328
- I went to my barbershop
to get a quick cleanup,

220
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:31,721
And boyle was there.

221
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,940
- Yeah, got a low-Drop fade
with a crisp lining.

222
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:35,681
I'm all about supporting
black businesses.

223
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,117
- Right.

224
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,902
- Oh, are you upset
about something, lieutenant?

225
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,165
- It's just that the barbershop
is my therapy.

226
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,209
- Mm.

227
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,689
- It's where i go
to clear my mind.

228
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,778
And that's hard to do
with you there.

229
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,650
- Mm.
- Stop mm-Ing me!

230
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:49,173
- It's my listening noise.

231
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:52,263
- Listening doesn't
require noise!

232
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:54,700
- So i reviewed
the aisha fulton case,

233
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:56,310
And it is definitely
problematic.

234
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:59,183
The arresting officers have had
several complaints before.

235
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:02,142
And their version of events
is only two sentences long.

236
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:04,841
- Suspect had suspicious item.
Scary.

237
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,190
- It's clearly bogus,

238
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,974
But an officer
did break one of his fingers.

239
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:09,802
- Probably from tackling her
to the ground.

240
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,369
- Yeah, or from pointing it
so hard

241
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:13,153
At everyone but himself.

242
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:14,677
[sighs]

243
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,984
- Who are you
performing this for, jake?

244
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:19,333
- Both of you guys.

245
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:21,205
- Look, i want to help,
but the problem is,

246
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:22,989
We have no proof
of what really happened.

247
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:24,469
- Let me guess,
their body cam footage

248
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,905
Was mysteriously corrupted.

249
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,472
- Yeah, they probably
tampered with it,

250
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:29,735
But between us,
there was a rookie there,

251
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,171
Janice lee.

252
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:34,392
If you can get her to confirm
your client's story,

253
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,698
I can help you.

254
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:37,395
Here's her address.
- Great.

255
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,963
See, rosa,
this couldn't be any easier.

256
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,791
- Frank o'sullivan,
head of the patrolmen's union,

257
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,749
And there is no way
on god's green earth

258
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:47,361
That you're ever talking to
anyone involved in this case.

259
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:50,887
- I mean... I guess it could be
a little easier.

260
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,935
- Why are you here, o'sullivan?
- Officer lee called me,

261
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,632
And i'm here to stop
your heartless crusade

262
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,069
Against our heroes in blue,

263
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:02,507
But to be clear, all i want
is to keep our city safe

264
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,770
And then to go home
to my ma at night.

265
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:05,902
- You live with your mom?

266
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:08,382
- My ma lives with me...
In her house.

267
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:10,123
Do you have something
against my ma?

268
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:11,734
Because i'll be honest
with you,

269
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:14,214
There's only three things that
i love in this whole world:

270
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:17,522
My ma, the nypd,
and billy joel.

271
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,002
And right now,
you're assaulting

272
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,264
Two of those three things.

273
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:21,874
- Wow. So billy joel
made your top three?

274
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,354
- And now you've assaulted
all three.

275
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,095
- Can we please just talk
to officer lee?

276
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,967
- Look, these are nice boys
that you're going after.

277
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:31,710
All the perp had to do was
show them what was in the bag,

278
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:33,799
But no, no,
she had to escalate things.

279
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:35,322
A finger was broken.

280
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,629
Do you understand that if
anyone else was being treated

281
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:39,718
The way our brave officers
are being treated,

282
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:41,372
There'd be marching
in the street,

283
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:42,721
Which i would oppose,
by the way,

284
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,505
Because marching leads
to rioting,

285
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,116
And rioting leads to looting.

286
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,639
- Okay, this doesn't seem like
it's gonna be a short rant.

287
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,075
- Yeah, we're gonna head out.

288
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,077
[funky music]

289
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:52,252
- Hello, captain.

290
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:54,124
It's so good to see you...

291
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,822
So, so good.

292
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,389
- What's with
the bizarre eye contact

293
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,912
And the weird way
you're talking, santiago?

294
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,087
Did you join a cult?

295
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:02,828
- What? No.
- Are you sure?

296
00:09:02,872 --> 00:09:05,352
Most cult members don't realize
they're part of a cult.

297
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:06,614
- I'm not in a cult.

298
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:08,573
I was trying
to connect with you.

299
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,401
It's a method
from this book.

300
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:11,924
- Oh, is that one
of terry's sex books?

301
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,796
- You mean one
of scully's sex books.

302
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,583
- Ever since i came back,
you've been acting distant.

303
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,672
What happened to raymy?
- Raymy?

304
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:23,240
- Ray and amy, raymy.
It's what people call us.

305
00:09:23,283 --> 00:09:25,111
- I don't know a single person
who's ever called us that.

306
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:28,288
- Regardless, something
is very wrong between us.

307
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:30,160
You made small talk
with me yesterday.

308
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,075
- Oh... You noticed that.

309
00:09:32,118 --> 00:09:33,250
- Of course i did.

310
00:09:33,293 --> 00:09:34,817
It was like a knife
to my heart,

311
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,341
Which is why we have to do
the exercises in this book.

312
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:39,299
Please, sir? Please?

313
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:40,823
- If i agree,
will you go back to work?

314
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:41,867
- Absolutely.

315
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:43,869
- Fine.
What's the next exercise?

316
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:46,089
- It is...

317
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:47,873
Way too sexual.
- Wow.

318
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,135
- We're gonna have
to skip around a bit

319
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:51,050
To make this appropriate
for work.

320
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:53,400
- Something seemed off to me
in o'sullivan's rant.

321
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:54,924
- How red he got?

322
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:56,621
Yeah, he looked like a candied
apple with a widow's peak.

323
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,449
- No, he said all the perp
needed to do

324
00:09:58,492 --> 00:09:59,798
Was show them
what was in her bag,

325
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,104
But that wasn't
in the police report

326
00:10:01,147 --> 00:10:02,932
And lamazar didn't know that,
so how did he?

327
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,021
I think o'sullivan
watched the body cam recording

328
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:06,370
Before it was corrupted,

329
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:07,806
Which means he might have
the original footage,

330
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,025
Which means if we want proof,

331
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,461
We need to break
into the union and get it.

332
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:11,810
- That's a lot of ifs.

333
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:13,159
And besides, we can't
break into the union.

334
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:14,465
They'd recognize us.
- No way.

335
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:15,901
Just put on a big dumb watch,
some oakleys,

336
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:17,642
And a camo baseball cap.
You'll fit right in.

337
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,165
- Okay, look,
as much as i would love

338
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,472
To take on the character
of mitchell keith erikkson

339
00:10:21,515 --> 00:10:23,866
From toms river, new jersey,
i can't do it.

340
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:25,041
- Why not?
You already named him.

341
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,085
- He named himself.

342
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:27,521
But i don't have a warrant,

343
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,653
And you could be arrested
for breaking and entering.

344
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:30,089
No, i think we should
knock on doors

345
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:31,438
And try and find a witness
to corroborate the story.

346
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:32,875
- You sure about that?

347
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:34,137
Have you talked to the people
of new york lately?

348
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,486
- Yes, i know what you think.

349
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,835
And obviously
things are a bit tense,

350
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,098
But i believe that people
still understand

351
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:40,317
That we're here to help.

352
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,232
- Nope.

353
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,668
- Yeah, i saw something.

354
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,322
It looked kind of like this.

355
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:46,845
- I don't talk to pigs.

356
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:48,325
- Copy that.

357
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:49,717
- Hey, charles.

358
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,719
I just got a random
venmo payment from you.

359
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:53,243
Was this an accident?

360
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,593
- No, it was the only way
i could express how sorry i am

361
00:10:55,636 --> 00:10:57,073
For what you've had
to go through.

362
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:58,552
Consider it a mini reparation.

363
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:01,033
- Mini? I wouldn't say
$10,000 is mini.

364
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,469
- $10,000!

365
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:03,862
- Yeah, when i saw
that you sent it,

366
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:05,733
I was like, this must
have been an accident,

367
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:07,605
Like you meant to send $100

368
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:09,781
And then thought you needed
to add the cents too

369
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:11,261
And then accidentally
added two zeros.

370
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,566
- That's a pretty good guess

371
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,438
As to what could have
happened... But didn't.

372
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:19,008
Because i meant
every last zero.

373
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:20,923
- I'm sure you did.
Thanks, charles.

374
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:22,054
- You got it.

375
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,752
- Wow, charles,
that was so nice of you.

376
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:27,538
- It was obviously
a mistake, scully!

377
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:28,539
- How many more of these
are we gonna do

378
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:29,888
Till you realize
it's pointless?

379
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:31,716
- Well, i don't think
it's pointless.

380
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,413
That's what i've been
trying to prove to you.

381
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:34,588
- Wait, i thought you said

382
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:35,981
You weren't trying
to prove a point.

383
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:38,288
- Well, yeah, but i mean,
i kind of had to say that

384
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,594
So you'd let me work with you
and i could make my point.

385
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:41,769
- See, this is why
we don't hang out anymore,

386
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:42,857
Because you're always
so defensive.

387
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,076
- Well, it's kind of hard
not to be

388
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,035
When you think
i'm a bad person now.

389
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,080
- I never said that.
- You didn't have to.

390
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,821
Rosa, we came up together.

391
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,388
We went to the academy
together.

392
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:52,998
We've had
the exact same career.

393
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,261
All we ever wanted
was to be detectives.

394
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:56,741
And yes, we've always known
there were problems,

395
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:59,570
But we would solve them
together from the inside.

396
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:01,528
So when you quit, yeah,
it made me feel

397
00:12:01,572 --> 00:12:03,139
Like you thought
i was wrong for staying.

398
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:06,794
- Jake, my choice has nothing
to do with you.

399
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,579
It was the hardest thing
i've ever done.

400
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:11,408
I gave up my career,
my friends, my whole life,

401
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:12,931
But i did it

402
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:14,759
Because i couldn't ignore
what i was a part of anymore,

403
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,414
Couldn't ignore what the police
are doing in my community

404
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:19,503
To people who look like me.

405
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:21,766
- I know, but not all of them,
not me.

406
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,681
- This isn't about you.

407
00:12:23,724 --> 00:12:25,204
And this case
where a black woman

408
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:27,598
Was assaulted by the police

409
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:29,382
Has nothing to do
with you either.

410
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:30,688
So if you're not here to help,

411
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:32,864
If you're just here
to prove a point, then,

412
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:35,171
Man, i don't think we should
work together anymore.

413
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,564
And i definitely
don't think we're friends.

414
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,572
- Scully, i need your help,
but you can't tell anybody

415
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:46,704
What i'm up to.
- Oh, not a problem.

416
00:12:46,747 --> 00:12:48,053
I don't talk to anyone
but hitchcock.

417
00:12:48,097 --> 00:12:49,794
- And nobody where i am
even speaks english.

418
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,752
- Where are you?
- Brazil, baby!

419
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,145
I got conned by a cam girl,

420
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,104
But it turns out,
i love it here.

421
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,062
- Okay, look, you two
are always complaining

422
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:58,629
About work regulations,
so i'm guessing

423
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:00,587
You know your way
around the patrolmen's union.

424
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:02,328
I need your help to break in.
- You bet.

425
00:13:02,372 --> 00:13:04,461
Those bastards are everything
that's wrong with policing.

426
00:13:04,504 --> 00:13:06,332
- Their dress policy's insane.

427
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:07,638
You have to wear a shirt
at all times.

428
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:09,335
- Yuck!
Just tell me how i can get

429
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:10,815
To o'sullivan's office
undetected.

430
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,208
- No problem.

431
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,079
He goes to lunch at 12:30,
so that's your window.

432
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:15,689
At 12:45,
the mail is delivered.

433
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,996
The guard at the desk always
flirts with the mail woman,

434
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,432
So he'll be distracted.

435
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,869
Then go down the main hall.
This is important.

436
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:23,784
It's your last bathroom stop
on the whole floor.

437
00:13:23,828 --> 00:13:25,090
It's unisex and handicap,

438
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:27,092
So you get that bad boy
all to yourself.

439
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:28,398
- Tell her
about toilet paper.

440
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,616
- Stop talking about bathrooms.

441
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,662
- Fine. Pee your pants.
What do i care?

442
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:34,143
Go to the last office
on the right and you're there.

443
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:36,536
- Well, that background
is on brand.

444
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,583
- Yeah, ma!
I got the tickets!

445
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,281
What do think?
Front row, ma, billy joel.

446
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:45,589
You, me, and the poet
of long island.

447
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:48,113
Huh? No, i know.

448
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:50,463
- So it says to participate
in a new hobby

449
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:52,465
Your partner
has expressed interest in.

450
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:53,988
Have you gotten into
anything new lately?

451
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:55,251
- I started performing
daily checks

452
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,991
Of my blood-Oxygen level
during covid

453
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:58,428
Because i feared for my life.

454
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,516
- Oh!

455
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,299
[device beeps]

456
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:01,605
- 98.
- 98.

457
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:02,649
- We did it.

458
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:03,824
We're back to being
raymond-Amy.

459
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,304
- It's raymy.

460
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:07,306
And you can't measure
our connection by blood levels.

461
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,003
Let's do another exercise.

462
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:10,048
- Regulations.

463
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:13,225
- Regulations.

464
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,444
- How much longer
do we have to do this?

465
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,662
- It was supposed to be
a meaningful word

466
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:17,490
To both of us,
but clearly that wasn't it.

467
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:20,014
Okay, now we're supposed
to tell each other

468
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,842
A secret no one else knows.

469
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,366
I'll go first.

470
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:26,804
I once had a sex dream
about sanjay gupta.

471
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,153
- This is absurd.
- I know.

472
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:29,198
And it was really graphic.

473
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:32,157
- No, these exercises.

474
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:33,332
We're not lovers.

475
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:36,466
We're not even friends.
We're coworkers.

476
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,729
I'm tired of terry's
stupid book.

477
00:14:38,772 --> 00:14:40,383
- Scully's book!

478
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,518
- I beg your pardon?

479
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:47,433
Did you just say
you want to bring gary?

480
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:50,132
- I need to speak with
my union president immediately!

481
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:52,525
- Ma, i gotta call you
right back. Okay.

482
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:55,441
Could i help you out, sir?
- I certainly hope so, sir.

483
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,443
My name is
mitchell keith erikkson,

484
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:00,838
And i've just been assaulted
based solely on profession.

485
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,535
- Oh, damn it to hell, son.

486
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,146
Tell me what happened.
- All right.

487
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:06,409
So i go to this phone store,
right, to get my screen fixed.

488
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:09,194
And they say, "yeah,
no problem, 45 minutes."

489
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:11,153
So i wait, and i wait.

490
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:14,199
50 minutes go by!

491
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:15,461
Nobody helped me.

492
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:16,897
- It's despicable.
- So i go back

493
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:18,203
Into the back room to complain,

494
00:15:18,247 --> 00:15:20,162
And they're all just
sitting around

495
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:21,902
Trash-Talking billy joel!

496
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:23,252
- What?

497
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:25,210
- They said, "piano man"
is his only good tune!

498
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:27,430
- Well, now,
that's just insanity.

499
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:29,823
- Hey, terry.

500
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,434
I have to come clean,

501
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,827
And please don't say anything
until i'm done,

502
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:35,351
Not that i'm trying
to silence you.

503
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,179
I am listening.
- Just say it!

504
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,745
- The $10,000 was supposed
to be $100.

505
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:41,183
And i was too embarrassed
to ask for it back.

506
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:43,620
- Boyle, i need
to come clean too.

507
00:15:43,663 --> 00:15:45,230
I knew you made a mistake.
- [sighs]

508
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:46,666
- I was just messing with you.
- You were?

509
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,625
- Obviously! [laughs]
- Okay.

510
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:50,627
- Look, boyle, it's great that
you're trying to do better,

511
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,585
But the way you're doing it
is kind of messed up.

512
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:54,935
If you want to do something
about these issues,

513
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,676
You have to do it because
you think it's the right thing,

514
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,591
Not because you want me
to know about it.

515
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:00,245
That just makes stuff
weird between us.

516
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:01,594
- You're right.

517
00:16:01,638 --> 00:16:03,117
You're right.
I won't be as performative.

518
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:04,249
[phone whooshes]

519
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:06,425
I just donated
to a great charity,

520
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:08,210
But i won't tell you
which one or how much.

521
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:10,429
- Good for you.

522
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:13,389
- For black trans women.
It was $1,000.

523
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:16,305
- Dear lord. I got out
of there 45 minutes ago.

524
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:17,610
Why were you in there
so long?

525
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:19,177
- O'sullivan
wouldn't let me leave

526
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:20,744
Until he had explained to me
why reverse racism was worse

527
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:22,963
Than, as he called it,
classic racism.

528
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,356
- How'd you know i'd be here?

529
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,444
- I bumped into scully,
and he told me everything.

530
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:26,663
He was really worried

531
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:27,751
You weren't gonna
take his toilet advice.

532
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:29,709
- Well, thanks for saving me
in there.

533
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:30,797
- Yeah, of course.

534
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:31,842
You know i've always
got your back.

535
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:33,191
And i'm not trying
to make a point.

536
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:34,366
I'm just here to help.

537
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,455
- Well, you did,
'cause i got the footage.

538
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:39,066
- Oh, i'm gonna have
to delete this.

539
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,633
- [laughs]

540
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:41,982
Yeah.

541
00:16:42,026 --> 00:16:44,420
Oh, wait,
you're not joking.

542
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,250
[gasps]
oh, no. You're a villain!

543
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,992
- Why'd you delete it?

544
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:53,516
You said you'd help us
if we got proof.

545
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,734
- Yeah, but i didn't think
you'd get proof, get proof.

546
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:55,779
I thought you just,
you know, get proof.

547
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:56,910
There's proof
and there's proof.

548
00:16:56,954 --> 00:16:58,085
You got the wrong kind
of proof.

549
00:16:58,129 --> 00:16:59,173
I don't know how much clearer
i can be.

550
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:00,305
- So you were never
gonna help us?

551
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:01,872
- I am helping you.

552
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:03,090
I can still get the charges
against your client dropped.

553
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:04,831
Now that i saw that footage,

554
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,311
I'll get my officers
to revise their statements.

555
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:07,530
- And they'll be punished?

556
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:08,748
- No, there's no way
i can suspend them.

557
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,141
- Suspend?
I thought you would fire them.

558
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:11,403
- [snorts]

559
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,144
Oh, you're being serious now.

560
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:14,841
Huh, i guess jokes
aren't our thing.

561
00:17:14,885 --> 00:17:16,800
Well, if i fired them,

562
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:18,802
It would trigger
the union's appeal process.

563
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:20,020
Pba's grievance proceedings
allow

564
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:22,327
For both unions
and individual officers

565
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:24,155
To challenge personnel actions
by superiors.

566
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:26,070
The complaint gets sent up
the chain of command

567
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,593
Till they get someone
who sides with the officers.

568
00:17:27,637 --> 00:17:29,595
And the courts
are a nightmare.

569
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:30,944
Prosecutors work closely
with cops.

570
00:17:30,988 --> 00:17:32,294
They're not gonna jeopardize
their relationship

571
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:33,773
By pursuing cases
against them.

572
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:35,558
All the officer has to say
is he feared for his life,

573
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:36,776
And it gets thrown out.

574
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,995
- Look, we know all of this,

575
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:39,562
But that doesn't mean
you just give up.

576
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:41,955
- Okay, so say i don't give up
and i get the commissioner

577
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,653
To agree to fire the officers.

578
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,002
Do you know what happens next?

579
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,960
- They'd file a countersuit.
- Yes.

580
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:48,614
And the officers
get paid to stay at home.

581
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:50,268
Not to mention
qualified immunity.

582
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:52,923
And now the officers
are back on the street

583
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:54,533
And i am blackballed.

584
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:57,667
And then one of the only
female captains in the nypd

585
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,146
Is forced to quit.

586
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,192
And you don't want me gone.
I'm one of the good ones.

587
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:02,976
And i know how that sounds,
but i'm not one of the bad ones

588
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,021
Who say they're one
of the good ones.

589
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,022
I'm one of the good ones
who say

590
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:06,153
They're one of the good ones.

591
00:18:06,197 --> 00:18:07,720
- Yeah, i hear it, rosa.
You can stop

592
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:09,374
Staring daggers at me.
Let's just go.

593
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:11,028
[knock at door]
- Sir, do you have a minute?

594
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,812
I wanted to apologize.

595
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:16,033
Being back at work
has been... Weird.

596
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:18,470
Rosa's gone,
and the world has changed.

597
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,124
And you were the one person

598
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,387
I thought i could count on
to be the same.

599
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,693
Always holt.

600
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:27,740
I know i've been acting crazy,
and i'm sorry.

601
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:33,355
- Do you know why i engaged
in small talk with you earlier?

602
00:18:33,398 --> 00:18:35,400
- Because small talk
is for strangers and con men,

603
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:37,533
And that's what i am
to you now, a stranger.

604
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:41,537
- No. I did it because...

605
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,103
I am a con man.

606
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:45,410
I was trying to con you

607
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:47,543
Into believing
everything is normal with me

608
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:50,415
When... It is not.

609
00:18:53,636 --> 00:18:55,159
Kevin and i have separated.

610
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:58,641
- [gasps]
oh, my god.

611
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:01,252
Why?

612
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:05,430
- It's been a tough year
to be a black man...

613
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:08,390
And a police captain...

614
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,653
And a human.

615
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:13,917
I've been pushed to the brink
emotionally and physically.

616
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,658
I went into survival mode,

617
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:19,879
And it seems i have...
Neglected my personal life.

618
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:21,707
- [sighs]

619
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:24,493
Does anyone else know?
- Not here.

620
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:26,669
I have successfully
hidden it for months—

621
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,279
Not very well, i might add.

622
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:30,803
I made small talk with peralta
on five separate occasions,

623
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,457
And he never even
batted an eye.

624
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:35,982
He just blathered on about
someone named... Wario.

625
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:37,157
- Yeah, he does that.

626
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:40,247
- But you... [chuckles]

627
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,686
You noticed that something
was off with me

628
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:45,165
The very first day
you returned.

629
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:48,255
That just shows
how well you know me.

630
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,301
And while i'm not yet ready
to talk about it,

631
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:53,304
It's nice...

632
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:56,176
Feeling like
i'm not alone anymore.

633
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,484
And that's thanks to you...

634
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:01,573
Raymy.

635
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:07,797
- Just so you know,
i am not raymy.

636
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,363
We are raymy.

637
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:10,930
- Just be glad i said it.
- Totally.

638
00:20:10,974 --> 00:20:12,671
Yes, i am. Thank you, sir.

639
00:20:12,715 --> 00:20:14,978
- So those cops are just gonna
keep walking the streets

640
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,154
Doing this crap
with no consequences?

641
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:19,330
- I'm sorry. We really tried.

642
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:21,550
- I guess getting the charges
dropped was something,

643
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:23,900
So thanks...

644
00:20:23,943 --> 00:20:26,250
To rosa
because you're not a cop.

645
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,382
I'll hook you up
with those five stars on yelp.

646
00:20:31,473 --> 00:20:33,823
- [sighs]

647
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:36,086
That was rough.
- Yep.

648
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:38,001
- Hey, so look,

649
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:40,525
I'm really sorry
about everything.

650
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:42,527
I was projecting
my insecurities onto you,

651
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,137
And that was wrong.

652
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:47,097
And i like to think i've done
a lot of good as a detective

653
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,492
And that i can
continue to do that, but...

654
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:56,846
Maybe i am part of the problem.

655
00:20:56,889 --> 00:21:00,327
Regardless, you're dealing
with things in your own way,

656
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,851
And i get that it's not on you

657
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:03,896
To make me feel okay
about my choices.

658
00:21:05,158 --> 00:21:06,551
- Apology accepted.

659
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:08,379
And just because
our choices are different

660
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:09,685
Doesn't mean we're not family.

661
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:10,816
- Like "the fast
and the furious."

662
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,383
- No.
- Right. No, not like that.

663
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:14,428
This is different, obviously.

664
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:15,995
The main point is,
you think i made

665
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,388
The right decision
staying on the force.

666
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:18,781
- [laughing] jake!
- I know. I'm kidding.

667
00:21:18,824 --> 00:21:20,173
I don't even care
what you think.

668
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:22,262
Your opinion is literally
meaningless to me, loser.

669
00:21:22,306 --> 00:21:24,134
- Yeah, now you swung too far
in the opposite direction.

670
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:26,571
- I felt that.
It's a hard line to walk, so...

671
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:28,530
- [laughs]

672
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:30,096
- I'll work on it.

673
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,360
[sighs]

674
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,409
Yeah.

675
00:21:38,452 --> 00:21:40,498
- Not a doctor.
Shh.
