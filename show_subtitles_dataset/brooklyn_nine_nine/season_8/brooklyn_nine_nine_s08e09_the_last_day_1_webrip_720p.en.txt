00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:09,486
Terry loves waking up. Terry—

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:10,618
Good morning, honey, time to—

4
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:12,315
What the hell are you doing?

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,664
- It's Holt and Amy's last day,

6
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,362
so we're having a final heist!
It's heist day!

7
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:16,406
- Couldn't you have just
sent an email?

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,712
- Nope, this was the only way.

9
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:20,236
I have to go alert the others.
See you soon!

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,933
It's heist day, Rosa!

11
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:24,327
- Whoops, sorry about
your milk. Gotta go!

12
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:25,502
- Niko, it's time for school.

13
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:26,808
- It's heist day, Charles!

14
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:27,939
- Where's Nikolaj?

15
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:30,638
- He's crying in the closet!
Gotta go!

16
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,596
- Babe, what are you doing?

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,902
- I was hiding
so I could surprise you.

18
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:36,948
But if you're here,
then who's in our shower?

19
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:38,341
- It's me, Captain Holt.

20
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:39,908
It's heist day, Jake.

21
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:43,259
Oh!

22
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:54,314
♪

23
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:05,890
- For Captain Holt
and Amy's last day,

24
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,631
I've been granted permission
to throw a final

25
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,198
non-holiday-associated heist.

26
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:11,374
- But before we begin,
I'd like to say a few words.

27
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:12,941
These last eight years
have been

28
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:14,159
some of the best of my life.

29
00:01:14,203 --> 00:01:16,379
I will always cherish
our time together.

30
00:01:16,423 --> 00:01:17,685
But not as much as I will

31
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,731
cherish drowning you all
in your own blood.

32
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,342
- What?
- It's the final heist

33
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:23,821
and I will chop off your limbs
and feed them to your young.

34
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,823
Now quit stalling
and introduce it.

35
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,434
- That's the spirit!
Now since there have never been

36
00:01:27,477 --> 00:01:29,262
an official
two-time heist winner—

37
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:30,437
- I won three times.

38
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,090
- One, at best!

39
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,440
Anyhoo, the point is,

40
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:35,050
all past heists
will be forgotten

41
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,095
and the only real winner
that matters is this year's

42
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,793
as they shall be crowned

43
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:40,273
the Grand Champion

44
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:41,448
of the Nine-Nine.

45
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,623
- I wish I could join you all,

46
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,146
but I want everyone to know

47
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,408
I am not playing.

48
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:46,322
- Here we go again.
- Oh, Terry.

49
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:47,497
- It's true.

50
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,759
I have my interview
to be the captain

51
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:50,587
of the Nine-Nine
this afternoon.

52
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:52,110
- We've all seen
this movie before.

53
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:53,938
You pretend not to play
and then at some key moment

54
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,766
you come Kool-Aid Manning
through a brick wall

55
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,073
and win the whole thing.
- I can't run through walls.

56
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,509
I am a normal human person.

57
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:00,641
- You do have
the Kool-Aid Man's

58
00:02:00,684 --> 00:02:02,120
exact physique and personality.

59
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,774
But he's not lying,
Terry will not be heisting.

60
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:05,428
I had him get
a notarized letter

61
00:02:05,472 --> 00:02:07,038
that says
he legally cannot win.

62
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:08,475
- You cheated on me
with another notary?

63
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:09,432
- I mean,
you're making it sound

64
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:10,738
more intimate than it was.

65
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:12,870
He just embossed something.
- Just embossed?

66
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:14,307
What else are you
gonna tell me?

67
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:17,222
Did you just put your
thumbprint in his log book?

68
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,659
- Both of them.
- Oh, my God.

69
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:20,008
- You know what?
We'll talk about this later.

70
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:22,184
Moving on. The six of us
will vie for the crown.

71
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:23,664
- You mean seven.
You forgot about me.

72
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:25,056
- You're not
a part of this, Hitchcock.

73
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,407
You're in Brazil.
- Or am I? Come and find out.

74
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,323
- Stop trying to trick us into
visiting you in South America.

75
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:31,889
- I'm kind of the biggest
ball in the sack here.

76
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:32,890
- Yeah,
I'm pretty sure the locals

77
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:34,239
wouldn't agree with that.
Okay!

78
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:35,458
We're gonna start off in teams.

79
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,851
I'm sure everyone could use
the extra help

80
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,679
since this year's heist
was so spur of the moment

81
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:40,768
and no one had time to plan
anything too complicated.

82
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,380
This year's plan is insanely
complicated.

83
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:45,816
Check it out.

84
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,644
We will be selecting
our partners with the help

85
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:49,646
of a beloved Nine-Nine fixture,

86
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,821
the big bag of loose teeth.

87
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:52,388
- What the hell?
- Are those human?

88
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:53,911
- It's evidence from
a century of bar brawls.

89
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,391
- The story of New York
is in this bag.

90
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:56,827
- The story of New York
is gross.

91
00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:58,351
- Yeah, Terry,
we live in a hell-mouth.

92
00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:59,743
Now, in this bag is a tooth

93
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:01,223
with each of
your initials on it.

94
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:03,660
Who wants to root around inside
and pick a partner?

95
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,662
- I'm not putting my hand
in a bag of dirty, old teeth.

96
00:03:05,706 --> 00:03:07,969
- It's not dirt, it's old blood
and dried phlegm.

97
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:09,666
Who's in? No one?

98
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,102
Are you really
all that squeamish?

99
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:13,017
Of course they're
all that squeamish.

100
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:14,149
It's part of my plan.

101
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,542
I'll volunteer to reach
into the bag

102
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:18,066
so I can rig the selection
process using...

103
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:19,372
this magnet.

104
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:20,547
Pretty dope, right?
I've also added

105
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,765
metal fillings to certain teeth

106
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:23,463
to ensure we get
the pairings that we want.

107
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:25,421
Holt will be playing with

108
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:26,683
Norm Scully.
- His name is Norm?

109
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:28,119
- My name is Norm?
- We don't have to

110
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,686
break into teams this year.
- You're lucky.

111
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,948
Hitchcock's with me,

112
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:32,297
so you're actually
getting two partners.

113
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:33,864
- Three if you include
my donkey friend.

114
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,605
Say hello to the team,
Donkey Scully.

115
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,390
- He named him after me!
- All right!

116
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:40,958
Rosa Diaz, your partner will be
the lovely Amy Santiago.

117
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,525
- Diaz, want to trade?
Hitchcock, Scully,

118
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:43,700
and the donkey, three for one?

119
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,788
I'll even throw in Cheddar.
- Why?

120
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:46,268
So he can spy on me?
- Oh, please.

121
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,052
Cheddar's not a spy.

122
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,314
Abort, she's onto us.

123
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:50,577
- So Cheddar has an earpiece?

124
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,405
- Wait, if Terry's out,
that means—

125
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,537
- Oh, yeah.
It's you and me, buddy.

126
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:56,321
- But I don't get it.

127
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:58,367
Why don't you want us
to be on the same team?

128
00:03:58,411 --> 00:03:59,716
- Because, Amy, no one can know

129
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,065
that we're working together.
- Smart.

130
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,676
And Charles will never
be suspicious

131
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,504
because he'll be so excited
to be your teammate.

132
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:06,897
- Yeah,
that sweet little dumbass.

133
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:10,161
For the final heist, we will
all be competing for this.

134
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:12,337
- Is that my medal of valor
from the very first heist?

135
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:13,730
- It is modeled after it, yes,

136
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:15,123
but this far more meaningful.

137
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,865
- I got mine for saving
the life of Maya Angelou.

138
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:18,953
- Boring!

139
00:04:18,996 --> 00:04:20,737
This one says
Grand Champion on it

140
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:22,217
and it's made out of golt,

141
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,262
a non-gold alloy that should
not be handled by women

142
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,395
who are pregnant or nursing.
Yours is garbage.

143
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,049
And this golden vessel

144
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:30,225
is from the precinct's
old pneumatic tube system.

145
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:31,966
It's been outfitted
with a time-release lock

146
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,054
set for midnight.

147
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:34,447
Whoever has the medal
at that time

148
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,578
will be the winner.

150

Now, let the Last Day Heist
begin.

151
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,108
- It's an amazing plan, babe.
- Thank you very much.

152
00:04:44,152 --> 00:04:46,415
And everyone's gonna be
so shocked when they find out

153
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,028
that I'm leaving the Nine-Nine.

154
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:53,378
- What did you just say?

155
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:54,815
- Yeah.

156
00:04:57,426 --> 00:04:59,515
- What do you mean
you're leaving?

157
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,821
- I mean,
that's what I want to do.

158
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,997
But only if you agree.
- I don't understand.

159
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,781
- Well, for weeks we've been
trying to figure out

160
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:06,304
how you can do your new job

161
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,481
and still have us be there
for Mac as much as we want.

162
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:10,657
And I really think this is it.

163
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,746
- Yeah, but we have
other options.

164
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,182
- Yeah.

165
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:16,314
But I think
this is the best one.

166
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,142
Look, you know I was scared
about having kids

167
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:20,231
'cause I didn't want
to be like my dad.

168
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:21,842
But if I do this,

169
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:24,235
I have a chance
to be the exact opposite.

170
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,542
And I don't want Mac to ever
feel the way I felt growing up.

171
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:29,066
- And I get that, I really do.

172
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,329
But you love being a detective.

173
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:36,160
- I know.

174
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:39,512
It's all I ever wanted to be.

175
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:40,817
Until now.

176
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:42,819
Now, all I care about

177
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:43,994
is what's best for our family.

178
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,344
And Ames, this is it.

179
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,477
I mean, you've earned
this incredible opportunity.

180
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:51,132
You can't do it halfway,
it's too important.

181
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:53,526
And Mac's my little buddy.

182
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,918
I want to be at home with him.

183
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,096
- Are you sure?

184
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,359
Because we could figure
something else out.

185
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,059
You know I would
do anything for you.

186
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,930
- I would do anything
for you too.

187
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:08,236
- Will you run
that half-marathon?

188
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,846
- I'm never running
the half-marathon, Amy.

189
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,196
You gotta stop asking.

190
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,285
- You really think
you'll be happy?

191
00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:17,201
I don't want you to give up
your dream job just for me.

192
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:19,639
- I have a new dream job now.

193
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:22,685
Trust me, I wouldn't say it
if I didn't mean it.

194
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,557
- I love you.

195
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,906
- I love you too.

196
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:35,829
♪

197
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:37,831
So...

198
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:40,224
we're good?
- Yeah, we're good.

199
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,052
- Oh, thank God, I spent
so much money on this plan.

200
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:44,054
- How much money, Jake?
- I mean, not an insane amount.

201
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:45,490
Mac definitely has to go
to state college now,

202
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:47,884
but the important thing is
we're on the same page.

203
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:49,103
Let me tell you about the plan.
- No.

204
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:51,801
- So the heist is actually
going to be

205
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,498
the perfect goodbye.
- What does that mean?

206
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,892
- Drama, glamor,
shocking twists and turns.

207
00:06:55,936 --> 00:06:57,285
And the whole heist
ends up with everyone

208
00:06:57,328 --> 00:06:59,026
at the Brooklyn Bridge.
- Is that meaningful?

209
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:00,636
Have we ever been there
together as a squad?

210
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,464
- Uh, yeah.

211
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:05,902
I'm not sure why
we all looked so intense,

212
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,295
we were just getting falafel.
- I mean,

213
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:09,340
that falafel stand
is really good.

214
00:07:09,384 --> 00:07:10,777
- True that, yeah.

215
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,430
Anyways, once everyone arrives

216
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,607
there's gonna be
a huge fireworks display.

217
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,217
- Uh-uh, no.

218
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,219
Remember when you almost blew
off your thumb with that M-80?

219
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:19,873
No fireworks.
- Okay, fine!

220
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,396
But luckily I have
a surprise guest lined up.

221
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,050
I reached out to
Bruce Willis' people

222
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:24,921
and they said that he would,
quote,

223
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:26,967
"Not engage with
something like that."

224
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,882
So, I think
it's gonna work out.

225
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:31,449
- Kay, but why are we
on different teams?

226
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,973
- Because in order
for this to work,

227
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:35,149
we absolutely have to win
the first leg of the heist.

228
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:36,411
It doubles our chances.

229
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:37,804
- Got it, so basically

230
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,457
we just have to keep Holt
from getting that tube.

231
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,590
- Yes, indeed.

232
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,114
I just realized we haven't
been alone without Mac

233
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:45,725
for like three months.
- Desk?

234
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,117
- Yep, let's do it.
- All right.

235
00:07:47,161 --> 00:07:49,250
- Enough talk.
I'm getting that tube.

236
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:51,034
Where'd it go?
- That tube has been

237
00:07:51,078 --> 00:07:54,037
whisked off to a secret
location which only I know.

238
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,300
And since I'm not competing,
I've agreed to help out.

239
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,172
I designed the first part
of the heist

240
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:00,870
to be a scavenger hunt
through memorable moments

241
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,132
from the last eight years.

242
00:08:02,176 --> 00:08:03,786
It's a trip down memory lane.

243
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,310
- Not a problem.
I have the memory of a—

244
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:08,835
the thing with
the big nose and ears.

245
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:10,140
- Prince Charles.
- No.

246
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:12,012
- I hid five clues,
each leading to the next.

247
00:08:12,055 --> 00:08:13,927
And the last one
gets you the tube.

248
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,581
The first clue
is under your chairs.

249
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,758
- "Our fallen colleague
missing still..."

250
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,673
- "His replacement
fits the bill..."

251
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,500
- I can think of one colleague
who literally fell.

252
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,676
We all watched it happen

253
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,460
and then we ate
his sweet candy insides.

254
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:26,853
- The vending machine!

255
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,506
Is one theory,
probably incorrect.

256
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,508
- Damn it, Charles.
Silent epiphany!

257
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,815
- It's a new machine.
It's beautiful!

258
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,512
- "His replacement
fits the bill."

259
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,732
- The slots aren't labeled.
How do we know what to press?

260
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:38,778
- Well, a vending machine code
is usually a letter followed

261
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:41,084
by a double-digit number.
Jeffords is being sentimental.

262
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:44,914
- Holy
- Got it.

263
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,350
- For the record,
it was gonna be B-nine-nine.

264
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:47,351
- Nobody cares.
My thing was better.

265
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:48,526
"When a fellow needs a friend,

266
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,441
it's what's on the inside
that counts."

267
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,009
- "Fellow needs,"
like felonies.

268
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:54,837
- "On the inside," like jail.

269
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:57,753
- Your cannibal friend.
- Charles, I highly doubt—

270
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:59,233
it's definitely that!
- Go!

271
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:01,365
- For the record,
I'm not a cannibal anymore.

272
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:03,716
My new passion
is needlepoint embroidery.

273
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,195
Look at these.

274
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:08,372
Two parrots in love.

275
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,071
A turtle with a monocle
and a top hat.

276
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:13,247
- Wow, it's so intricate.
How do you—

277
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,205
- Ahh!
- Oh, no, no!

278
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,772
- Okay, you got me.

279
00:09:16,816 --> 00:09:17,860
I was gonna eat you.

280
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:19,079
That's still my thing.

281
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:20,863
It's even affected
my needlepoint.

282
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:23,736
Look at this. Liver.

283
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,738
A heart.

284
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:27,870
Butt.

285
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:29,263
An arm.

286
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:30,133
Mmm.

287
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,656
Oh, and there's this one

288
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,398
that your delicious-looking
lieutenant asked me to do.

289
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:35,704
- The third clue.

290
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:38,141
"Where the devil lies,
you'll find your prize."

291
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:39,795
- Well...

292
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,275
I know where the devil lies.

293
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:43,364
Wuntch's grave.
- Wow.

294
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:44,974
Did Terry put up
a balloon arch

295
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,410
just for the heist?
- No, that was me.

296
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:47,934
I come every week
to install a fresh one.

297
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:49,544
But enough chit-chat.
Let's dig her up.

298
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:50,850
- I don't think
we wanna do that.

299
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:52,112
- Why, are you scared
of what she'd look like?

300
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:54,114
She's just a corpse
with worms for eyes,

301
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:55,506
no different
than when she was alive.

302
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,465
- Found it. Here.

303
00:09:57,508 --> 00:10:00,076
- "Don't tell me where the next
clue is hidden, tell me why."

304
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,382
- "Tell me why."

305
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:03,123
From that time Jake made
the perp sing that song.

306
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,254
- Wait a minute,
you guys know about that?

307
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:05,429
Were any of you actually there?

308
00:10:05,473 --> 00:10:06,953
- You've told us the story
many times.

309
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:09,390
- And tried to recreate the
moment on several occasions.

310
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:11,784
♪ Working at the car wash

311
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:14,525
- No, number two and five,
you're off key.

312
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,397
Number three, you're coming in
way too early.

313
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,486
I mean, what are we even
doing here, guys?

314
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,183
So which one do you think
killed your family?

315
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:21,663
Yeah, I got to stop
trying to recapture

316
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:23,360
the magic of the original
and move on.

317
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:25,536
Anyways, back to
the eighth annual heist.

318
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,016
♪

319
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,366
Oh, no! Janitor Dan
is erasing the clue!

320
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,020
No!

321
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,500
- Stop! Stop!

322
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,415
- You're welcome.
- Damn it.

323
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,243
I love that guy, he's so nice.

324
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,027
Ruined the whole heist and
we can't even be mad at him.

325
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,550
- Yeah, we gotta call Terry.
- Already on it.

326
00:10:39,594 --> 00:10:40,638
It's going
straight to voicemail.

327
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,162
- No problem,
I actually installed

328
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,990
malware on his phone
in case he started heisting.

329
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,469
I have access to
his microphone and speaker.

330
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,732
- So, Lieutenant Jeffords,
can you handle

331
00:10:47,776 --> 00:10:50,126
the increased responsibility
of being a captain?

332
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,520
- I'm glad you asked.
I'm very responsible.

333
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:54,652
- Terry! Terry!

334
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,916
Terry, it's Jake and the squad
calling from your butt.

335
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,569
Terry, Terry, Terry!

336
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,006
- I'm sorry, what's happening?
- I didn't hear anything.

337
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,355
- Terry, answer your butt.

338
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,009
Answer your butt.
Answer your butt.

339
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:05,141
Don't ignore your butt, Terry!

340
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:06,316
Terry, come on,
it'll just take a second.

341
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,491
We just need the final clue.

342
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:09,537
- A perfect world,
a time of bliss,

343
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,626
a loving and inspiring kiss.
- We can't hear you.

344
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,715
Please speak directly
into your butt.

345
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,021
- A perfect world,

00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:17,371
a time of bliss,
a loving and inspiring kiss.

347
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,939
- Wonderful!
Thank you, Terry, that is all.

348
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,114
- "A loving
and inspiring kiss."

349
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:22,376
That's gotta be Jake and Amy.

350
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:23,986
And we know it's not
the last couple years

351
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,988
because they've basically
stopped kissing in front of us.

352
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,208
- All right. Wait a minute!

353
00:11:28,251 --> 00:11:29,949
"A Perfect World" is a movie
with Kevin Costner,

354
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:31,776
or should I say Kevin Cozner.

355
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,256
It's a kiss between
Holt and Kevin.

356
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,475
- The one that
brought them back together.

357
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:36,433
Out front in the rain!
- Ooh!

358
00:11:36,477 --> 00:11:37,913
- Well, looks like
it's gonna be

359
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:39,697
a sprint out of the elevator.
- This is unfortunate.

360
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,047
I didn't want to have
to reveal it this early.

361
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,048
- Reveal what this early?

362
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:43,832
- My most precious secret.

363
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:45,312
My tattoo!

364
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:48,968
What am I looking at?

365
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:50,404
- Is that what I think it is?

366
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:53,537
- Kevin's human head
on Cheddar's dog body?

367
00:11:53,581 --> 00:11:55,452
- I asked for a tattoo
of Kevin and Cheddar.

368
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:57,019
I don't know why
he combined them.

369
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:59,152
- It's—it's—

370
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:00,805
- It's the ultimate
distraction.

371
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:01,981
- No, wait, wait!

372
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:03,896
- Sorry, but you're too late.

373
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,114
The tube is mine.

374
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,160
Wait, it's empty.
Where'd it go?

375
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:10,511
- You looking for this?

376
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:11,773
Surprise reveal.

377
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:12,774
Gina?

378
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:19,563
- Well, well, well.

379
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:21,739
You thought you could have
a final heist without me?

380
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,567
- I texted you about it
like 50 times.

381
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:24,960
- Yeah, but, Jake,
I'm important now.

382
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:26,527
So if you want to reach me,
you should call into

383
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,745
"Watch What Happens Live."

384
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,530
Andy Cohen always
knows where I am, okay?

385
00:12:29,573 --> 00:12:31,532
Anyhoo,
I'm gonna keep this safe

386
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:34,143
by driving it around
in this hot little mama.

387
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,362
- You rented an armored truck?

388
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:36,580
- No, I bought it.

389
00:12:36,624 --> 00:12:38,147
It felt like it was great
for the heist

390
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,888
and it's also just
such a wonderful way

391
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,672
to flex on you guys
how rich I am now.

392
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,936
I'm all about Salmons.

393
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,328
Salmon.
You don't know about

394
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:46,721
the $10,000 bill
that has a picture

395
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:48,679
of Salmon P. Chase on it?
He's like—

396
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:49,985
It's sad you were
unaware of that.

397
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:51,552
Oh, my gosh,
this is embarrassing

398
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:53,423
for all you broke bums.

399
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,990
Okay.

400
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,906
You're gonna regret
the day you fired me.

401
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,560
- You left of
your own volition!

402
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:01,344
We each spent
meaningful time with you!

403
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:04,434
We were incredibly supportive!

404
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:05,740
- Thank you for considering me.

405
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,698
Again, I'm sorry about
that interruption.

406
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:10,005
I know the heist seems crazy.
- No, no, no.

407
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:11,876
In a difficult job,
it's vital to give people

408
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,617
a chance to blow off
some steam.

409
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:15,271
That's just good leadership.
- Wow!

410
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:16,707
I was sure you'd be angry.

411
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,493
I figured this interview
was over.

412
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:21,060
What?

413
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:22,452
There's a price tag
on this chair.

414
00:13:22,496 --> 00:13:24,237
- Oh, well, I must have
forgotten to take it off.

415
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,629
It's a recent purchase.

416
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,544
You should know, Jeffords,
I want to keep you here.

417
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,764
- You want to keep me here?

418
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:31,853
- Yes, at the NYPD.

419
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,768
- Hmm.

420
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:37,467
Wait a minute.

421
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,121
There's no light bulb
in this lamp.

422
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,082
This computer
isn't even plugged in.

423
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,171
And there is no light

424
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:47,042
coming from this window.

425
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:48,739
Son of a bitch!

426
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:50,350
This is a fake office.

427
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:51,916
It's all part of the heist!

428
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,309
- Oh, Jake,
what do we do now?

429
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,224
- Obviously, our plans
have changed a little,

430
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:56,878
but the perfect goodbye
is still in our sights.

431
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:58,053
Our objective is the same.

432
00:13:58,097 --> 00:13:59,837
Get that tube from Gina
before Holt does.

433
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,970
- How do we break into
an armored truck?

434
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:04,973
- What are you two doing?
- Oh, sorry,

435
00:14:05,017 --> 00:14:06,714
Mac's done with daycare
so we had the babysitter

436
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:08,107
bring him by
so we could say hi.

437
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,978
'Cause we're gonna be home
late tonight, so—

438
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,807
- Yeah, just trying to strike
that heist-life balance.

439
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,635
Isn't that right,
little Mac-a-docious?

440
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,332
Isn't that right, Mac-a-roonie?
- Yeah.

441
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:17,812
- Ugh.
- Yeah!

442
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,987
- Well, when you're done,
come find me.

443
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,076
We gotta talk strategy.
- Got it.

444
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,599
- I can't believe
she fell for it.

445
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:23,992
- So, I don't understand,

446
00:14:24,036 --> 00:14:25,820
you guys are paying me
to babysit a fake baby?

447
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:27,604
- Yeah, we're just hoping
people think it's real.

448
00:14:27,648 --> 00:14:28,823
- Oh, cool.

449
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,129
You think it's working?
- I do not.

450
00:14:30,172 --> 00:14:33,088
- Okay, so this truck
is a fortress on wheels

451
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:35,264
and we are not getting in there
without an intricate plan.

452
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,224
- I was just gonna jump on it
as it drives by.

453
00:14:38,267 --> 00:14:39,703
- Yeah, okay.
- Dope.

454
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:43,620
- Here she comes.
- Copy.

455
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:46,493
♪

456
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:47,798
- That was crazy!

457
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,104
Now how are you gonna get in?

458
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:51,715
Right, every woman
should own an axe.

459
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,154
What the hell just happened?

460
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,417
- So, here's the plan.

461
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,071
I latch on to the bottom
of the truck

462
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:01,290
and unbolt the emergency exit
hatch while it's still moving.

463
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:02,987
- Oh, but that's impossible.

464
00:15:03,031 --> 00:15:04,859
Unless you finally did it?
- I did.

465
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:07,601
I bought us magnet suits!
Check it out.

466
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:08,950
- No!

467
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:11,387
- Ha-ha!
- So sweet.

468
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:12,780
- I got it off Ukrainian Etsy.

469
00:15:12,823 --> 00:15:14,347
They sell arts and crafts
and tactical gear.

470
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,478
It's a weird site.

471
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:16,697
- So we stick to
the bottom of the truck.

472
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,655
It's brilliant.
But how do we get on?

473
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,092
- Through a manhole
outside the precinct.

474
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:21,832
We just have to get Gina
to stop right on top of it.

475
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,356
- She might stop
for a pedestrian.

476
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,879
If we could figure out
someone who is willing

477
00:15:24,922 --> 00:15:26,489
to step in front
of a moving truck.

478
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,578
- Lucky for us, we know someone
will do anything for money.

479
00:15:28,622 --> 00:15:30,276
- Hey, guys.

480
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,843
- Hey, Bill. Rough year?
- Yeah, the pandemic

481
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:34,715
was really hard on my industry.
- Which is?

482
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,804
- Nursing home seductions.
- Oh, my God.

483
00:15:36,847 --> 00:15:39,807
- Well,
that's enough, Bill.

484
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:47,554
- Damn it, Gina.

485
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:49,033
- She drove off. Are you okay?

486
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:51,079
- I'm good, I just gotta
start getting these bolts off.

487
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:52,428
- Stupid Rosa.

488
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:53,864
Thinks she can jump on my truck

489
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,649
like Salt
from the movie "Salt."

490
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,131
What the hell?

491
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:00,958
- We're stopping.
Why are we stopping?

492
00:16:02,221 --> 00:16:03,265
- Time to talk strategy.

493
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,572
Let's be honest,
we're not young men.

494
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:06,747
- Speak for yourself.

495
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,531
My doctor said
I'm in my twilight years.

496
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:09,663
- That means
you're close to death.

497
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:11,186
- But it has
such a pretty name.

498
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,320
- We're not gonna force our way
into an armored vehicle.

499
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:15,843
We'll need to use our brains.

500
00:16:15,886 --> 00:16:17,410
In the end, Gina will just

501
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:18,889
hand me the keys to that truck.

502
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,196
- You.

503
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,285
- Unusual activity
on your socials?

504
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,940
- You hacked me.
- I gave control of your entire

505
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:27,463
social media portfolio

506
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:28,682
to Hitchcock and Scully.

507
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:29,944
- And you told them
to embarrass me?

508
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:33,991
- Worse, I told them
to just be themselves.

509
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:37,256
- My God, I've agreed
to host an Instagram Live

510
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,866
for Outback Steakhouse.

511
00:16:38,909 --> 00:16:41,260
- They're inside the precinct,
if you want to go stop them.

512
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:42,609
- You're a monster.

513
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:44,741
♪

514
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:46,003
- Hey there, Ray-Ray.

515
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,744
- Nice outfit, Peralta.

516
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,485
It's very attractive.
I'm making a pun.

517
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,226
I know that's a magnet suit

518
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,185
because I sold it to you.
- You're Kazimir?

519
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,840
And unfortunately for you,

520
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:59,321
I have a remote
that can active your vest

521
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,931
and prevent you
from controlling it.

522
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,281
- No, no, no!

523
00:17:05,197 --> 00:17:07,895
You stick around, okay?

524
00:17:07,938 --> 00:17:10,463
- "Stick around"
was another magnet pun.

525
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:11,725
- Yeah, I get it was a pun!

526
00:17:14,684 --> 00:17:17,426
- Jake, there you are.
- No, no, don't come in here!

527
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,341
Yeah, the magnet suits
have a couple of drawbacks.

528
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:21,430
- They look cool, though.
- They look so cool!

529
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,258
Probably still worth it.

530
00:17:23,302 --> 00:17:25,042
- I lost the tube.
Can't even stand

531
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,566
on top of a fast-moving truck
that suddenly

532
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,394
slams on its brakes.
What's wrong with you, Rosa?

533
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:30,439
- It's okay.
Here, check this out.

534
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,702
I've been spying on Holt
for over a month.

535
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:35,270
He brought a drone which
he's using to take the tube to

536
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:38,055
the Bark Hyatt Doggy Daycare
where it will be retrieved

537
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,057
by none other than
Cheddar the dog,

538
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,972
who will take it
to a secret hiding place.

539
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:44,061
We could grab it,
but the Bark Hyatt play area

540
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,889
has live feed webcams.
- Holt will see

541
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:46,890
if someone goes for the tube.

542
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,936
- Not if that someone is a dog.

543
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:49,980
- I'm not dressing up
like a dog.

544
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:51,155
- I'll do it.

545
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:52,331
- Oh, my God!
- I was eavesdropping

546
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:53,723
and when the dog thing
came up, I said,

547
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,856
"Bill, this is your moment."
- That's okay, Bill.

548
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:57,292
I already have
someone on in the inside.

549
00:17:57,336 --> 00:18:00,208
Meet Biscuit, the dog
I adopted for the heist.

550
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:01,514
- Don't you have
horrible allergies?

551
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:03,167
- Or was that just a long con
I perpetrated

552
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,560
to win this heist?
- I don't think so.

553
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:06,780
- You're right.
I am covered in hives.

554
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:09,478
Anyway, Biscuit is also
enrolled at the Bark Hyatt

555
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,567
where he's been trained
to steal the tube

556
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:14,135
right from under
Cheddar's wet little nose.

557
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,484
Then we visit Biscuit

558
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,094
and get the tube.
- Nice work.

559
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,705
I almost feel bad
that I have to betray you.

560
00:18:18,748 --> 00:18:20,794
- What? Then don't!

561
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,318
- You made me meet
with a fake person

562
00:18:23,362 --> 00:18:25,189
just so you could trick me
into sitting out the heist?

563
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:26,713
That interview was important!

564
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:28,323
It's my shot
to become captain!

565
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:31,195
I bought fancy new suspenders
for this, with gold thread!

566
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:32,980
I can't return them
because I've already

567
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:34,329
stretched them out
with my pecs.

568
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:36,679
They've been pec-stretched!
- Slow down.

569
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:38,768
Edward Williams is not a fake.

570
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:40,509
- Then why was he
in a fake office?

571
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,599
- Oh, Terry,
he just relocated to make room

572
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:45,819
for the new reform unit
on the sixth floor.

573
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,995
It's a temporary space.
- Ooh.

574
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:50,345
- Lieutenant.

575
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:51,520
What did you do?

576
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,610
- I may've gotten a little...
heisty.

577
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:57,352
I'm supposed to believe
this is your family

578
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,354
and not the picture
that came with the frame?

579
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:02,836
Oh, and this is a real award?

580
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,707
Kapow!

581
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:06,013
- We have to go fix this.

582
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,493
Your career is more important
than a game.

583
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:09,364
Scully, you're in charge
of the heist until I get back.

584
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,061
Keep an eye on that tube.
- Yes!

585
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:12,889
Hitchcock, this is our chance
to show everyone

586
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,065
what we're made of—
Oh, it's you.

587
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:18,286
Donkey Scully,
go find Hitchcock.

588
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,027
- The hell? I'm stuck.
- Yeah, I rigged it.

589
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,072
That's what you get for being
a nerd who wears seatbelts.

590
00:19:22,116 --> 00:19:24,640
Cool people die gruesome,
preventable deaths.

591
00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:25,728
Oh, here's my ride.

592
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:28,905
♪

593
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:30,951
- Pimento's here.
- Hi, Pimento.

594
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,519
- Amy, it has been too long.

595
00:19:33,562 --> 00:19:35,347
When are you gonna
let me meet my godson?

596
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,436
- He's not your godson?
- Okay, but when you die,

597
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,089
I am going to raise him.
- All right, let's go.

598
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,134
- Yeah. I gotta drop you off

599
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:41,265
and then I have
a plane to catch.

600
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:42,484
- What, where are you going?
- Ugh.

601
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,573
I took this job
protecting a diamond mine

602
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,749
in Northern Canada
that's being terrorized

603
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:48,185
by a pack of wolves?

604
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,579
Apparently it's
"illegal to shoot them"

605
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,407
so I have to tear them apart
limb from limb.

606
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:54,104
- How long you going for?
- As long as it takes me

607
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:56,280
to find the alpha, kill it,

608
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:58,282
take control of the pack,

609
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:01,111
and then completely decimate
the diamond mine.

610
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:03,592
Total double cross.

611
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,289
All right, let's ride!

612
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,248
Bye, Amy.
- No, wait.

613
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,946
Rosa, no, no,
you can't leave me here!

614
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,079
This wasn't part of the plan!

615
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:16,431
Or was this exactly the plan?

616
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,477
- It's all part
of the perfect goodbye.

617
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,217
Everyone should think
they have the winning tube,

618
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,219
but then at midnight
when the time locks release,

619
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,656
they'll realize
they actually just have

620
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:25,745
a sentimental gift from me.
Look what I got Holt.

621
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:26,833
It's the first tie I bought

622
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,312
after he started
making me wear them.

623
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:30,358
And I'm getting Rosa a travel
board game so she knows

624
00:20:30,402 --> 00:20:31,707
that we're gonna keep doing
game night even though

625
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,361
the Nine-Nine's breaking apart.
- Aww.

626
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,971
- And I'm also getting
everyone AirPods.

627
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:36,712
- Hmm, I'd lose those.

628
00:20:36,756 --> 00:20:38,322
Feels like it
cheapens the sentiment.

629
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:39,802
Plus, everyone
already has headphones.

630
00:20:39,846 --> 00:20:40,847
- Okay, fine, no AirPods.

631
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,283
So, in order for this to work,

632
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:43,937
we have to get to the golden
tube before Holt does

633
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,287
and swap it out for the one
with the tie inside.

634
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,159
Hey there, Ray-Ray.

635
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,292
Then with Rosa believing
that Holt has the real one,

636
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,815
you just need to come up
with a fake heist

637
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,209
and then find a way
to slip her the dummy tube.

638
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:57,472
- It went perfectly.
- Same here, sort of.

639
00:20:57,516 --> 00:20:58,995
We came back to change
'cause we had to ditch

640
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,170
our magnet suits
in the armored car.

641
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:01,389
It was fine for me.

642
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,521
Charles went commando
for some reason.

643
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:04,000
Anyway,
he's getting dressed now.

644
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:05,393
We just have to figure out
a way to slip him his gift

645
00:21:05,437 --> 00:21:06,786
and then we're all set.

646
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:08,875
The perfect goodbye
is so close I can taste it.

647
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,485
- Yum, yum, yum.
- Gah!

648
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:12,226
Bill, you can't sneak up
on people like that.

649
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:13,662
I gotta go.

650
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,185
- Jake!

651
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:16,360
- Hey. What's up, you okay?

652
00:21:16,404 --> 00:21:17,884
- Are you quitting
the Nine-Nine?

653
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,495
- What? Why would you—

654
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:22,366
- I found this letter
of resignation in your locker.

655
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,629
Were you not gonna tell me?

656
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:25,500
Does our friendship
mean nothing to you?

657
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,502
- Charles, I can explain.
- Don't bother.

658
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:29,896
- Wait, no, wait,
Charles, wait a second.

659
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:31,811
Charles, come back.

660
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:34,509
- Seems like
someone's in the market

661
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:37,077
for a new best friend.
- Bill, I swear to God.

662
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,601
- We look exactly the same.

663
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,909
- Guh, okay.

664
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:44,998
- Fremulon.

665
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,087
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
