- For Captain Holt and Amy's
last day,

3
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:08,525
I've been granted permission
to throw

4
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:10,266
a final non-holiday-associated
heist.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,225
The heist is actually
going to be...

6
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,443
the perfect goodbye.

7
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:14,575
- What does that mean?

8
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:15,750
- That I'm leaving
the Nine-Nine.

9
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:17,491
- It's a trip
through memorable moments

10
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:18,883
from the last eight years.

11
00:00:18,927 --> 00:00:20,102
- Drama, glamor,

12
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,582
shocking twists and turns.

13
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,410
The perfect goodbye
is so close, I can taste it.

14
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:24,585
- Jake!
- What's up? You okay?

15
00:00:24,628 --> 00:00:25,716
- Are you quitting
the Nine-Nine?

16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,240
- What?
- I found this letter

17
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:28,458
of resignation in your locker.

18
00:00:28,502 --> 00:00:30,286
- Charles, I can explain.
- Don't bother.

19
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,070
- Wait, no, wait.
Charles, wait a second.

20
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:34,638
- Seems like someone's in the
market for a new best friend.

21
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:36,336
- Bill, I swear to God.

24

- Amy, Amy,
we've got a problem.

25
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,968
Charles found out
I was leaving somehow

26
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:01,752
and he got so upset
that he ran away.

27
00:01:01,796 --> 00:01:03,232
I don't know where he went and
he's not answering his phone.

28
00:01:03,276 --> 00:01:04,799
- Don't you have
a tracker implanted

29
00:01:04,842 --> 00:01:06,583
in his brain or something?
- Amy, I would never do that.

30
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:08,019
It's a serious
medical procedure.

31
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:09,760
Which is why I had a doctor
do it eight years ago

32
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,588
when they were operating on the
bullet wounds in Charles' butt.

33
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:13,460
- Smart, stick it
in his butt holes.

34
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:14,983
- Oh, I was expecting
more judgment from you.

35
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:16,463
And definitely
a different phrasing.

36
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:17,725
Anyways, I think that
the magnet suit must've

37
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:19,074
fried the tracker
so we gotta figure out

38
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:20,380
a different way to find him.

39
00:01:20,423 --> 00:01:22,425
- Well, don't ask me,
he's your best friend!

40
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:23,861
- Yes, he is my best friend!

41
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:25,907
I know exactly where he is.
Here.

42
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,648
Guard this with your life.
I'll be right back.

43
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,215
- Sir, I've made
a terrible mistake.

44
00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:31,956
I am sorry about your pictures

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,350
and your award
and your computer—

46
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,960
- And yelling that
I was wearing a wig

47
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:38,093
and then trying to tear out
my actual hair?

48
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:39,224
- No, that was a compliment!

49
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:40,835
It's so thick and full

50
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:42,750
for a man of your age.
- What?

51
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:44,621
- Let me handle this.
The truth is,

52
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:47,058
Lieutenant Jeffords acted
like an irresponsible,

53
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:48,190
insane madman.
- What?

54
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,322
- Yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

55
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:50,627
- But looking at this incident

56
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,020
from a different angle,

57
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:54,414
it shows why he'll make
a great captain.

58
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:55,545
He's here before you

59
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:57,242
owning his mistake.

60
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,766
When I started
at the Nine-Nine,

61
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:01,899
I felt I had to be seen
as infallible.

62
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:03,074
But he taught me

63
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,034
the importance
of being seen as human.

64
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:07,818
He made me a better leader.

65
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:10,038
And you would be a fool
not to make him a captain.

66
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,389
- Terry's touched.

67
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,348
- Yes, powerful words.

68
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,784
As are these:

69
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:18,655
happy heisting, suckas!
both: What?

70
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,179
- Oh, you were right,
this was a wig.

71
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:22,616
Ow.

72
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,836
both: No!

73
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,621
- Hey, can I talk to you?
I have a question.

74
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,492
- Is it will I ever forgive you
for betraying me

75
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:30,885
and abandoning me in a car?

76
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:32,365
- No, I have no questions
about that interaction.

77
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:33,801
It was funny and I'm pleased
with how it played out.

78
00:02:33,844 --> 00:02:34,845
This isn't about the heist.

79
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,630
What did you think about, um,

80
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:38,240
me and Pimento as a couple?

81
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:42,026
- Oh, uh, I don't know.

82
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,420
You guys always made me
a little uncomfortable.

83
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,856
There weren't a lot
of boundaries.

84
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,162
- Is this about that time
we smashed in your car?

85
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:48,468
- You did? Which car?

86
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,121
- All of them.
And once in your dad's Miata.

87
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:52,297
My point is,
when Adrian and I broke up,

88
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:53,516
something felt off.

89
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,865
I think it's 'cause
I wasn't out yet

90
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,954
so I couldn't really
be myself with anyone.

91
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:58,521
But I don't know,
I always thought

92
00:02:58,565 --> 00:02:59,870
we would end up together.

93
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,524
And now he's going away and—

94
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,874
ugh, this is stupid.
- It's not stupid.

95
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:05,223
You gotta tell him
how you feel.

96
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,224
- He's already at the airport

97
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:07,443
and he doesn't own a phone.

98
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,012
I'll never make it in time.
- Yes, you will!

99
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:13,667
Another surprise reveal.

100

we knew you were around.

- I watched you enter.

102
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:17,061
- Nope, you were both shocked.

103
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:18,672
Come on, I'll give you a ride
to the airport.

104
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,238

that's nice but traffic.

105
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:21,631
- Oh, sweet Rosa.

106
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,067
There's no such thing
as traffic

107
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,156
when you're driving
in an armored truck.

108
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,462
- Okay, let's do this.

109
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,594

believe you're leaving.

to be there for Mac.

if I can come in to work

I mean, maybe the you of nine
years ago couldn't handle it,

but you're not
that person anymore.

- Nikolaj.
- Why don't you

just call him Nick?
- Nik.

ruining the moment.

or not, we're always gonna be

Life partners.
- Best friends.

152
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,632
And the only reason
I didn't tell you sooner

153
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:52,592
is because I wanted it
to be a surprise

154

that the whole heist's
actually a setup

155

- I love that!

157
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:58,641

to the Brooklyn Bridge

159
00:04:59,947 --> 00:05:02,689
So, here's yours.
- Oh!

00:05:03,994 --> 00:05:04,952
- Okay.

00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:09,522
The most recent issue of
"Fancy Brudgom" magazine?

00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:10,871
- You know how you always
wanted them to do

164
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:12,394
a Fancy Bedste Venner
feature on us?

165
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,570
- Yeah, but that's just
for the fanciest best friends.

166
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,007

172
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,107
- Really?
What even is "our team?"

173
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:31,413
Because I know
you gave me a dummy tube.

174
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,023
- Ah, and did you find
what was inside of it?

175
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,242
- Yeah, an egg.
- And do you know

176
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:35,896
why I gave you an egg?
- 'Cause eggs suck

177
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:37,288
and you're still mad
about that one time

178
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:39,073
I beat you at Mario Kart?
- It was beginner's luck!

179
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:40,727
Just—open it.

180
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:46,776
- A necklace
with a little binder on it?

181
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,908
- It has three tiny tabs.

182
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:49,605
One for me, one for you,
and one for Mac.

183
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,346
- Aw!

184
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,087
It really bothers me
that they're not alphabetical

185
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,392
but I assume
that it's functional

186
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:55,916
and I can correct them?
- It is and you can.

187
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,179
- Then I love it
and I'll treasure it forever.

188
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:00,050
Now tell me where
the real tube is, you bastard!

189
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,443
- I'm sorry, Ames,
but I can't do that.

190
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,227
You've done your part.
Now, it's time to sit back

191
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:06,056
and enjoy the rest of the show.
- You're cutting me out?

192
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,754
This is about you wanting
fireworks, isn't it?

193
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:10,278
- Oh, Amy, it's about
so much more than that.

194
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:11,845
It's one million percent

195
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:13,890
just about the fireworks.
- Those look very dangerous.

196
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:14,935
- No, it'll be fine.
We're not gonna be

197
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,197
anywhere near when it goes off.

198
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,459
You control the whole thing
from your phone.

199
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,503
- How do you know
when it's armed?

200
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:19,504
- The red light
starts blinking.

201
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:21,985
- Like that one?
- Uh-oh, uh, uh—

202
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:23,726
you know what?
This is okay, this is okay.

203
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,685
I can just turn it off
using the app.

204
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:27,382
"Set up your profile first?"
Why?

205
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,905
How many times am I gonna
use a fireworks app?

206
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,212
- It started counting down!
- Name, email.

207
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:32,866
"Select the squares
with stop signs in them?"

208
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,084
- Okay, Jake, we gotta go!

209
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,259
- Is a stop light a stop sign?

210
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:36,739
Charles, is a stop light
a stop sign?

211
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:38,001
- I don't know,
they both require full stops!

212
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:39,437
Jake, come on!
- All right, I'm in.

213
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,917
No, "username already taken?"

214
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:41,875
Who would want to use "Jake?"

215
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:45,443
[countdown beeping]

216
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,619
Oh, no.

217
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,496
- Oh, my God.

218
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,541
You're awake.

219
00:06:56,585 --> 00:06:58,543
I can't believe it,
you're actually awake.

220
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,371
- Hey.

221
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:01,721
Wait a minute.

222
00:07:01,764 --> 00:07:03,418
What's going on?
I gotta get back to the heist.

223
00:07:03,461 --> 00:07:05,725
- No, the heist?

224
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,161
Jake, you've been in a coma

225
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,249
for seven years.

226
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:11,252
[dramatic music]

227
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:12,470
- What?
[beep]

228
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:17,693
- What do you mean
I've been in a coma?

229
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,912
- A firework
hit you in the head.

230
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,653
It caused a destabilizing
brain injury.

231
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:22,350
- Oh, my God.

232
00:07:22,393 --> 00:07:23,743
Is Charles okay?
- Yes.

233
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,266
He survived the explosion,

234
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:27,747
but he blamed himself
for what happened to you

235
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,226
so he left New York.

236
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,273
He's actually the sheriff
of a small town in Arizona.

237
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:34,623
The town is so small he also
has to be the school principal.

238
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,451
- Okay, that's weird.

239
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:38,453
- It's actually very funny.

240
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:40,107
And surprisingly heartwarming.

241
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,456
- Wait, no. No, no, no.

242
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,284
This—this isn't
really happening.

243
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:44,633
I'm dreaming.

244
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,722
And because this is a dream,
I'm in control.

245
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,159
You know who's gonna walk
through that door right now?

246
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,466
Bruce Willis.

247
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,034
- Jake, you woke up!
- No! Teddy?

248
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:55,992
Amy, why is
your ex-boyfriend here?

249
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:57,254
- Oh, you haven't
told him yet, babe?

250
00:07:57,298 --> 00:07:58,386
- Uh.
- Babe?

251
00:07:58,429 --> 00:07:59,779
He called you babe.
What's going on?

252
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,389
- I'm sorry,
I know this is a lot.

253
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:02,782
- No.
- But the last seven years

254
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,784
have been really hard.
Raising Mac on my own,

255
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:05,959
never knowing
if you would wake up,

256
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,483
and Teddy was
a great friend to me.

257
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:09,832
And a couple years ago,

258
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:11,616
we went on a trip.
- It's not her fault.

259
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,314
We were both seduced
by the city of Tampa.

260
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:15,490
- I can't believe this.
You replaced me with Teddy?

261
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,970
- I could never
replace you, Jake.

262
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:18,972
I just wanted Mac to have
a father figure in his life.

263
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:20,582
I come over
and we watch sports.

264
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,150
We are obsessed
with college swimming.

265
00:08:23,193 --> 00:08:24,760
- Hey, doc, can you put me
back in the coma?

266
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,936
- You're agitated,
that's normal.

267
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,503
Tell me how you're feeling.
Pain?

268
00:08:28,546 --> 00:08:29,722
- I mean, just the pain
of learning

269
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:31,158
that my wife is married
to another man.

270
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:32,246
- Oh, we're not married.

271
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,247
I'm just here
for Amy physically.

272
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,465
- That's worse!

273
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:36,032
- Okay, let's do
some cognitive tests.

274
00:08:36,076 --> 00:08:38,078
How good is your memory
from before the accident?

275
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:40,384
Do you remember the fireworks?
- Yeah, I remember everything.

276
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:41,864
I remember the whole heist,

277
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,648
going to find Charles,
the magnet suits.

278
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:44,954
- Do you remember
where you hid the tube?

279
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:47,261
- Yeah, inside the fake baby.

280
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:48,566
- Thanks, babe.

281
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:51,831
- Oh, no.
It's not the future, is it?

282
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:53,833
- No, it's only been
about 40 minutes?

283
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:56,183
And this isn't a real hospital.

284
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:02,189
- You Mission: Impossibled me!

285
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:05,714
Oh, I'm so happy you're not
having sex with Teddy!

286
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,802
[wheezing laugh]

287
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,151
- Damn it, we're locked in.

288
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:09,718
Who are you working with,
you coward?

289
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:10,850
- I didn't do anything.

290
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,808
I bet this was
all Santiago's plan.

291
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,636
She's making a play
for the tube.

292
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,333
She knew you hid it
at Doggy Daycare.

293
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:17,595
- How do you know her plan?

294
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,988
- Since I wasn't part
of the heist,

295
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,642
people were sloppy around me
with their secrets.

296
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,122
I know everything.

297
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:23,601
For instance,
I know the real tube

298
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:25,690
is inside that creepy,
fake baby doll.

299
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:26,822
- Why didn't you tell me
this earlier?

300
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,215
- I was trying to be respectful

301
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:29,433
of the heisting process,

302
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:31,566
but that was before
I got screwed over.

303
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,568
- Well, your intel is of no use

304
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:35,483
since we're locked in here.

305
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:38,051
Unless you smash your
gigantic body through the wall.

306
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:40,096
- I am not the Kool-Aid Man!
- Okay.

307
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,490
- I am more than my muscles
and I can prove it.

308
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:45,188
All the locks in this building
have a magnetic release

309
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:46,537
in case of a fire.

310
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:48,844
If we can overload
the circuit, they'll unlock.

311
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,063
We just need to connect

312
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,239
the positive terminal
of one outlet...

313
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:54,328
[grunts]
To the negative of the other,

314
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:57,331
using this circuit board
and a low-resistance wire.

315
00:09:57,374 --> 00:09:59,681
Luckily, I came prepared.

316
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,509
- Do suspenders
conduct electricity?

317
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:03,380
Oh, the gold thread!

318
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:06,296
- Now, we are about
to overload the circuit.

319
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:09,299
[electricity zapping]

320
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:11,824
- Bing pot.

321
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,260
- When did you have time
to build all this?

322
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:15,044
- Oh, I had it prefabbed
months ago,

323
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:16,480
and I set it up while
you were looking for Charles.

324
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,482
- You planted the resignation
letter in my locker

325
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:19,919
so Charles would find it.
- Yep.

326
00:10:19,962 --> 00:10:22,225
And then I knew you'd wanna
show off the fireworks.

327
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,880
The fireworks that I sold you.
- You're Kristaps?

328
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,927
- Gah, I got to stop
falling for that.

329
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,059
But wait, if everything
was fake, what knocked me out?

330
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,409
[timer beeping rapidly]
Oh, no.

331
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:35,282
- What are you doing?
- I know, Charles,

332
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:37,545
but there's something
I have to tell you, okay?

333
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:38,981
I locked Charles
in a supply closet.

334
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:41,244
- I have but two things
to say to you.

335
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,419
One: thank you.

336
00:10:42,463 --> 00:10:43,551
I've always wanted
to be chloroformed.

337
00:10:43,594 --> 00:10:45,814
And, two: how dare you?

338
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:46,859
- Sorry, babe.

339
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:49,426
But I play to win.
- Gah!

340
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,472
That was super cool.

341
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:53,648
I hate how attracted
I am to you right now!

342
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:55,128
- That worked so well.

343
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,651
On to phase two.

344
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:58,131
Thanks for doing that, Teddy.

345
00:10:58,174 --> 00:10:59,784
I'm really glad that
we could be friends again.

346
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:01,395
- Of course.
I'll always be here for you.

347
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:02,831
Which is why
I have a question to ask.

348
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,659
- Oh, no.
- Amy Santiago,

349
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:05,660
will you marry—
- No!

350
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:07,836
I am married to Jake.

351
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,577
- And I'm married to Elizabeth.
It's perfect.

352
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,752
Plus, you just betrayed him.

353
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,232
You guys are obviously
having issues.

354
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,973
- No, I only betrayed him
to pull off my secret plan.

355
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:17,150
I am throwing him
the perfect goodbye

356
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,978
and it has to be a surprise.
- Fine.

357
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:20,718
But if you think
I'm just gonna sit around

358

the keys that are down there?

a chicky for a key.

375
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,669
- Right.

376
00:11:58,713 --> 00:11:59,714

is that again?

have the key.

you said it a little different

- Everything hinged
on Jeffords.

I needed him
to drop out of the heist

440
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:51,347
so he'd have access
to everyone's secrets,

I texted Kevin
who retrieved the tube

448

who lured you all here

00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:15,491
The associate principal cellist
for the Berlin Philharmonic?

517
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:16,884
She's my surprise celebrity.

518
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:18,059
- Are you kidding me?

519
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,495
You ruined my big goodbye
to the Nine-Nine

520
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,802
so we can listen to some nerd
play a giant violin?

521
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:22,890
- Shall I begin?
- No.

522
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,065
- Wait, wait, wait,

523
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,068
did you say your goodbye
to the Nine-Nine?

524
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,548
Where you going?

525
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:31,115
- Uh, well,

526
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,900
I was hoping that this would be

527
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:37,383
a more dramatic moment
accompanied by fireworks but...

528
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:39,254
I'm leaving the NYPD.
- You are?

529
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,386
- What?
- Theriouthly?

530
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:41,952
- For real?
- Yeah.

531
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:43,345
Today was my last day.

532
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,042
And now it looks like

533
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:46,043
it's gonna end with all of us

534
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,785
locked in a storage facility.

535
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:51,310
- No, it's not.

536
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:52,528
Can't you see?

537
00:16:52,572 --> 00:16:54,965
You all want the same thing,

538
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:56,271
a perfect goodbye.

539
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,360
But you're all getting
in each other's way.

540
00:16:58,404 --> 00:17:01,276
We are the Nine-Nine,

541
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,278
and we work best together.

542
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,932
And we're getting
out of here together.

543
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:07,804
So we're gonna find that tube
and we're gonna be crowned

544
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:10,981
Grand Champions
of the Nine-Nine together!

545
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,419
- Except for the ugly one
that made fun of my cello.

546
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:15,769
- Not now,
Caroline Saint-Jacques Renard.

547
00:17:15,812 --> 00:17:17,074
- I agree with Jeffords.

548
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:18,641
Read the room,
Caroline Saint-Jacques Renard.

549
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:20,121
- Great speech, Terry, but
we're kind of trapped in here.

550
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,949
- Not for long.

551
00:17:21,992 --> 00:17:24,604
I'm gonna Kool-Aid Man us
the hell out of here.

552
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:25,779
- I thought you said
that was impossible.

553
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:27,824
- It's not,
I just find it demeaning.

554
00:17:27,868 --> 00:17:29,217
It's actually very easy.

555
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:32,394
- Ah!

556
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,224
[crashing]

557
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:37,747
- Oh, yeah!

558
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,446
- Oh, yes!
Now go through that wall!

559
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:42,448
- I'm not doing any more walls,
Jake, we're free.

560
00:17:42,491 --> 00:17:43,579
- Fair enough, I had to ask.

561
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:46,278
All right,
I got Bill on the GPS.

562
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,496
Huh, that's weird.

563
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,629
- What? Where'd he go?

564
00:17:49,672 --> 00:17:51,021
- Are you sure he came back
to the precinct?

565
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:52,762
The tracker must be broken.
There's no one here.

566
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,504
- Wrong, Captain!

567
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:56,331
I'm here.

568
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,463
Michael Hitchcock,

569
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:00,814
the Grand Champion
of the Nine-Nine.

570
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:01,815
- Hitchcock?

571
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:04,557
- Well,
this doesn't feel right.

572
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,736
- I bet you're all wondering
how I pulled it off.

573
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:10,737
- Not really, but I guess
that's the tradition.

574
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,781
- The key to the whole plan

575
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,217
was that I never really retired

576
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,697
or moved to Brazil.

577
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:16,786
I've been living in the
Beaver Trap this whole time.

578
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,527
- Okay, but what was
the rest of the plan?

579
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:19,746
- Oh, we had not
come up with it.

580
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:21,051
- But then Bill came by
and offered

581
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:23,837
to sell me the tube
for 40 bucks and I won.

582
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,361
- Pretty good stuff.
- Now, crown me.

583
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,884
- Ugh, this stinks.

584
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:29,843
Okay, Michael Hitchcock,

585
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:32,324
you are an amazing human/genius

586
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:35,762
and the Grand Champion
of the Nine-Nine.

587
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:37,067
Why is your head so sweaty?

588
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:38,547
- Oh, because
that's actually butt skin

589
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:40,593
from a botched hair transplant
so there are more pores.

590
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,029
- I can't believe
this is how it ends,

591
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:43,639
with Hitchcock's
sweaty butt head.

592
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:45,162
- I told myself I wouldn't cry.

593
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:46,686
- Ah, Jake,
I'm sorry you didn't get

594
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,905
your perfect goodbye.
- Yeah.

595
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:50,516
This whole thing
did kinda turn into

596
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,213
a scalding hot mess.

597
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,389
But to be honest,

598
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,999
I think I just wanted
a big dramatic moment

599
00:18:56,043 --> 00:18:57,784
so that I wouldn't feel sad.

600
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:00,787
Because goodbyes
are inherently sad.

601
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,441
They mean
that something's ending.

602
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:04,007
And this one is especially sad

603
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,096
because what we had
was so great.

604
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,012
But it's not all sad, right?

605
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:10,753
We're moving on
to things that we love.

606
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:12,364
And we'll always have

607
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:14,670
the memories
of our times together,

608
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:15,802
even though Hitchcock
won the heist,

609
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:16,977
which makes me so mad

610
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,718
I wanna swallow
my own tongue and die.

611
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:20,981
- It's a disgrace.
- Anyways,

612
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:23,592
I say we hang out,
have a drink,

613
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:25,899
and enjoy all of us
being together one last time.

614
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,206
To the squad.

615
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,207
all: To the squad.

616
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,255
- You just drank cement!

617
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,822
- Why?

618
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:38,433
- Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

619
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,957
I just want you to know
that I don't care

620
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,830
if you end up with anyone
or get married or whatever.

621
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:45,484
I just want you to be happy.

622
00:19:45,527 --> 00:19:46,833
- I am happy.

623
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:48,443
I'm making a difference,
I've got great friends.

624
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,402
Also, I'm moving in
with my girlfriend, Debra.

625
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:52,491
She is amazing.
She makes me feel whole.

626
00:19:52,534 --> 00:19:53,492
- Oh, really?

627
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,145
- Oh, my God, this is too easy.

628
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:56,582
No, I don't want
to settle down.

629
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,192
- Right. I'm sorry, sorry.

630
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:00,803
- It's fine.
I'm just messing with you.

631
00:20:00,847 --> 00:20:03,415
It's crazy you're leaving.

632
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,677
We spent a lot of time here.

633
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,418
- Yeah, we did.

634
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:10,683
I'm really happy
it was with you.

635
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,424
- Same here.

636
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,904
I love you.

637
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,689
- I love you too.

638
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:18,081
[glasses clink]

639
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,170
- Hey, Boyle, I'm glad
you're sticking around.

640
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:22,042
I'm gonna be
depending on you a lot.

641
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:24,305
- You got it, Captain,
for diet and exercise tips.

642
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,872
- What? No.

643
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:27,917
To solve cases. My body's fine.

644
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,963
- Nice,
that's a very healthy attitude.

645
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:32,531
- Hey, guys, can I be real?

646
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:35,490
I just took a bunch of diamonds
from the evidence locker.

647
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,492
No one ever changed the code.

648
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,494
Anyway, toodaloo.

649
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:41,975
- Was she being real?

650
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:43,759
- I honestly can't tell.

651
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:44,978
- I missed you, bud.

652
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,936
- I missed you too.

653
00:20:49,025 --> 00:20:50,940
- [sniffs] Mmm.

654
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:53,160
You got wing sauce
on your collar.

655
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:56,337
- I left it there for you.

656
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,951
- So, you're leaving.

657
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:04,737
That must've been
a hard decision.

658
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,347
- Honestly...

659
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,874
It wasn't.
- It's funny.

660
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:13,397
On my first day here,

661
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:16,139
I asked Jeffords
to tell me about everyone.

662
00:21:16,183 --> 00:21:18,141
He told me you were
a great detective,

663
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:19,926
but the one thing
you couldn't figure out

664
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:22,494
was how to grow up.

665
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:24,800
Well...

666
00:21:24,844 --> 00:21:26,236
I think you've finally
figured it out.

667
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:30,893
- Well, thank you, sir.

668
00:21:30,937 --> 00:21:32,286
I couldn't have done it
without you.

669
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:33,940
- Over the years,
you've sometimes referred to me

670
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,332
as something
of a father figure.

671
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:36,725
- Did I? I didn't realize that.

672
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,074
- But I want you to know

673
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:40,729
if I had had a son

674
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:46,126
and, uh,
he had turned out like you,

675
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:47,997
I would be very proud of him.

676
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:56,310
- Thank you, sir.

677
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:58,225
Wow.

678
00:21:58,268 --> 00:22:00,314
Wasn't expecting
to get this emotional.

679
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:02,577
- It's not bad
for an old robot, huh?

680
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,579
Beep-borp. Zeep.

681
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,146
- [chuckles]

682
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:08,801
Sir, did you just make a joke?
- I believe I did, yes.

683
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,063
I guess in the end,

684
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:13,457
we rubbed off on each other
quite a bit.

685
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,982
Title of your sex movie.

686
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:18,027
Did I do that right?

687
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:20,073
- It was perfect.

688
00:22:20,116 --> 00:22:22,031
[both chuckle softly]

689
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,511
- Guys, I hate to say it,

690
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:26,079
but it's late and some of us
have to work tomorrow.

691
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:30,649
