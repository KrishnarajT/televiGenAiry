1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,535
Hey, Gina, you got that file
I needed Captain Holt to sign?

2
00:00:04,536 --> 00:00:06,775
Uh-huh.

3
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:16,952
Mm.

4
00:00:16,986 --> 00:00:19,354
Gina hasn't taken her eyes
off her phone in two hours.

5
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:21,457
First person to make her
look up wins the pot.

6
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:22,758
I'm in.

7
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,960
A bet which improves
someone's manners? Double score.

8
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:26,395
Sorry, guys.
I got this in the bag.

9
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:28,097
I used to have to distract her
from her phone

10
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:30,299
all the time
when we were smooshin' booties.

11
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,800
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:33,869
Hey, girl...

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,305
Catch you later.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,841
Mid-morning dance party.

15
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:42,945
She's dancing even better
than normal.

16
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,515
Oh, my God, did you hear
that George W. Bush died?

17
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:47,683
Who dat?

18
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:50,452
Ooh.

19
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,955
Gina may never look at another
real human being again.

20
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:53,988
She's unbeatable.

21
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,392
Oh, I don't know about that.

22
00:00:57,393 --> 00:01:00,329
Terrence Jeffords,
are you kidding me?

23
00:01:00,363 --> 00:01:03,499
Changed my relationship status
to "it's complicated."

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,733
Pony up, y'all!

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,502
Whoo!

26
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:08,537
It's my wife.

27
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:10,539
Hey, baby.

28
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,541
No! No, no, no.
It was a mistake.

29
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:15,577
My thumb slipped and...
I have to go home.

30
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:38,967
Ladies and gentlemen, today
is the greatest day of my life.

31
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:42,571
Guess who just got murdered!

32
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:45,107
That's right...
it's Carl Mather.

33
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:47,676
What? I'm the only one gasping?

34
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,512
Guys, Carl Mather?
Did 25 years in Attica...

35
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:52,881
Sor... sorry.

36
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:54,116
Just point at me
when you want me to gasp.

37
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,384
Will do.

38
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:57,653
Mather is part
of the Fulton Street Four.

39
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:58,921
Oh!

40
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:01,423
They stole $21 million
from an armored car depot.

41
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:03,392
Feds caught them
but they never found the money.

42
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:06,128
- Until now.
- You found $21 million?

43
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:07,963
Oh, God no.
Not yet.

44
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,732
I can see how that would
be confusing though.

45
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,300
I'm sorry.
But I'm going to.

46
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,501
Over the past six months,

47
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:14,169
all four of these guys
have been released,

48
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,771
and now one of them
shows up dead.

49
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:17,306
Someone's after that money,

50
00:02:17,307 --> 00:02:19,341
and they're willing
to kill for it.

51
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,744
You're getting ahead of
yourself.

52
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:22,978
You don't know
that Mather's death

53
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,279
is connected to the money yet.

54
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:26,381
Don't turn this into something
bigger than it is,

55
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:30,018
not with Madeline Wuntch
watching us at all times.

56
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:33,288
Ew. When'd they put that in?

57
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,057
Right after Wuntch got promoted.

58
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,959
She had it installed
at that height so she'd,

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,862
I quote, "always be looking
down at me," unquote.

60
00:02:39,863 --> 00:02:41,263
Treat this like a regular case.

61
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:44,299
Sir, with all due respect,
this is an epic case.

62
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,534
It's the reason I became a cop.

63
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:46,815
I mean, hunting down a murderer,

64
00:02:46,836 --> 00:02:48,537
recovering millions
in stolen money,

65
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:50,819
rappelling out of a chopper
with a knife between my teeth.

66
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,074
Why would you jump
out of a helicopter

67
00:02:52,075 --> 00:02:53,108
with a knife in your mouth?

68
00:02:53,143 --> 00:02:55,477
It's called a chopper,
and the knife is in my mouth

69
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:57,679
because both of my hands
are holding giant machine guns.

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,448
And that's how it's going down.

71
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:02,951
Okay, reminder,
tomorrow we are hosting

72
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:05,821
a field trip for
the Brooklyn Park Magnet School.

73
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:07,656
Sorry, Sarge, I can't be
around magnets.

74
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:08,791
Pacemaker.

75
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,659
I'm actually not gonna
correct you on that.

76
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,228
Guys, I really need this
to go well.

77
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,664
My girls are on the wait list
for their preschool

78
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:17,700
and it's twice as tough
to get in with twins.

79
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,134
Why don't you just get
one of them in

80
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,003
and then let them take turns
going to school every other day?

81
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:23,405
Diaz, that's crazy.

82
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:24,773
I asked my wife and she said no.

83
00:03:24,808 --> 00:03:27,142
This field trip has to go well.

84
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:28,977
This is my chance
to impress the principal.

85
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:30,579
Sarge, you're in luck.

86
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,815
I went to a magnet school
where I was voted

87
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:35,351
"most likely to befriend
a school administrator."

88
00:03:35,352 --> 00:03:36,618
Oh, Amy.

89
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,420
Preteens are my people.

90
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:40,022
I speak their language.

91
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:42,191
They are gonna have
an amazing time.

92
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,892
Thanks, guys.
That's great.

93
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:45,227
If you want, I can show them
some of the cool stuff

94
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:46,495
we have in the evidence locker.

95
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:48,297
I'm pretty sure
there's a bag of hands in there.

96
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,898
Whoa! No. No.

97
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,700
We got to make
this place kid-friendly.

98
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:53,502
No crime scene photos
lying about.

99
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:54,837
That's not a crime scene.

100
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:57,272
That's a boudoir photo
I'm having framed for my wife.

101
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:59,341
That's me underneath the mask.

102
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:00,409
Oh, God!

103
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:04,179
Next, let's get
statements from the neighbors.

104
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,481
Ah, hello, Captain.

105
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:07,650
Quick update: Another one
of the Fulton Street Four

106
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:09,051
was murdered here this morning.

107
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:11,820
Huh, I'm surprised you're
not celebrating inappropriately.

108
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:13,822
This is a crime scene
and I'm a professional.

109
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:14,990
You did it before I showed up?

110
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,492
Yeah, that is exactly correct.

111
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:19,061
So two of these guys murdered
in the past two days?

112
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:20,529
It has to be tied
to the missing money.

113
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,563
Admit I was right.

114
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,632
Circumstances do suggest
a connection.

115
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:24,900
Admit it with more gusto.

116
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,769
- You were right.
- Yes! Did you get it, Boyle?

117
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,137
Oh, the camera
was in selfie mode,

118
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:29,538
but I look super proud of you.

119
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,141
Unfortunately, because this case
has turned out to be important,

120
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,409
that she-skunk Madeline Wuntch

121
00:04:33,443 --> 00:04:35,077
has her hindquarters
pointed right at it.

122
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,745
She wants to see us
in her office,

123
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:38,580
no doubt to give the case
to Major Crimes.

124
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:39,815
No, no, no.
We can't let that happen.

125
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:40,783
Sir, we have to do something.

126
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:41,917
Fine.
I'll seduce her.

127
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,118
I'll just put on my bike shorts

128
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,787
and give her a glimpse
of the quad cities.

129
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:46,555
No. No.
That's not what I meant.

130
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,756
I meant we have to fight her.

131
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:49,725
We're not gonna fight her.
She's the devil.

132
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:53,495
And you don't dance with the devil,
because you get burned.

133
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:54,897
Also, because
in Madeline's case,

134
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:57,733
she has no rhythm and her hands
are like little rat claws.

135
00:04:57,767 --> 00:05:00,769
If she wants the case,
it's hers.

136
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,705
For the record,
you're turning this murder scene

137
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:04,206
into a real bummer-scape.

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,374
Tell me you got that zinger.

139
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,942
Oh, the camera was in
selfie mode again,

140
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,177
but I was really laughing hard.

141
00:05:08,178 --> 00:05:09,611
Okay.

142
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:14,817
Okay, kids, this is where my
detective squad solves crimes.

143
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:17,486
- Wow.
- This is my desk.

144
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:20,489
You can tell by the framed
200-piece puzzle

145
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,324
my three-year-olds
put together on their own.

146
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,226
That's very advanced,
Sergeant Jeffords.

147
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,462
Is it? I wouldn't know
what milestones

148
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:29,965
are impressive to a school
admissions officer.

149
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,067
They can count to 20
in English and Mandarin.

150
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:35,304
Hi. Detective Santiago,
magnet school alumna.

151
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:36,905
Well, I appreciate that you used

152
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:38,674
the proper declension
of alumnus.

153
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,609
Well, some say Latin
is a dead language,

154
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,012
but I say it's just
taking a long nap.

155
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:48,250
Okay, you two are
obviously the alphas.

156
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,718
Let me guess.

157
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,156
You're dating the blond kid
and you like Filipino Bieber

158
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,691
but you're worried
he's still into

159
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:58,193
Little Miss Side Braid
Janky Purse.

160
00:05:58,228 --> 00:05:59,295
How did you know?

161
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:01,964
I know so much.

162
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:03,766
Hi, I'm Gina.

163
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,901
Hey.

164
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:10,372
Hello, Raymond.

165
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:13,609
How do you like
my new office? 20th floor.

166
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:15,244
Yes, I never thought
I'd see you this high

167
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:16,378
without a broom under you.

168
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,613
Enough niceties.
Have a seat.

169
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:20,516
Thanks, but I'm actually
fine standing.

170
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:24,286
I could stay in these
bad boys all day.

171
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,255
So two members
of the Fulton Street Four

172
00:06:26,256 --> 00:06:28,223
have been murdered...
sounds like a big case.

173
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:30,225
No, it's actually the opposite.

174
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:32,394
Pretty much an NBT sitch.

175
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:33,963
No big thang.

176
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:36,865
The word is "thing,"
and the thing is big.

177
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,401
We believe someone is after
the missing $21 million,

178
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,870
and solving this murder
could lead us to the money.

179
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,206
Sure, but that money's,
like, 25 years old.

180
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,674
It's probably not
even good anymore.

181
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,977
Sorry. Cramped up.

182
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:50,713
This is a very important case,
Raymond,

183
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:53,048
to me, and to the city
of New York.

184
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:55,184
I'm not sure the Nine-Nine
has the resources

185
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:56,852
to deal with something
of this magnitude.

186
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,687
I understand the politics.

187
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:00,489
This is a high-profile case.

188
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,157
Do what you must.

189
00:07:02,192 --> 00:07:03,926
What I was going to say is,

190
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:05,761
since you don't have
the resources,

191
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,042
I'll give you anything you need.

192
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,731
The case is yours.
You have my full support.

193
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:09,798
What?

194
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:13,331
He meant that more excited.
Like, "What!"

195
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:17,700
Okay, two of
the Fulton Street Four are dead.

196
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:20,103
My hunch... one of them
is killing off his co-scums

197
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:21,738
so he can keep the money
for his scum-self.

198
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:23,239
We'll start with Reggie Bludsoe.

199
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,341
He listed a Brooklyn address
with his parole officer.

200
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:26,809
We're gonna nail
this son of a bitch.

201
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,944
Unless he's innocent...

202
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:29,279
then we're gonna save
the son of a bitch.

203
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:30,980
Either way, this case
is gonna be awesome.

204
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,750
Peralta, I'm putting myself
on this investigation with you.

205
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:35,518
- What? Why?
- Wuntch is up to something.

206
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,787
There's only one reason why
she would let us keep this case.

207
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,055
She took one look at me
and said,

208
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,723
"That's the guy I want
flying my chopper."

209
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:41,891
You know how to fly a chopper?

210
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,126
How hard could it be?

211
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:44,527
It's just a big fan
that goes in the sky.

212
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:46,563
She let us keep this case
because she wants us to fail.

213
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:48,531
I'm coming along
so that you don't waste

214
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:50,800
time and resources
turning this investigation

215
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:52,402
into another Ron McClane movie.

216
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:54,637
Oh, you know it's John McClane.

217
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:57,140
I've made my decision.
End of discussion.

218
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:58,308
All right, fine.

219
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,809
But you're gonna have
to take your own car.

220
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,978
I signed out that drug dealer's
Lamborghini from the impound.

221
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,046
It only has two seats.

222
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,647
I saw that you had made
that request.

223
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:06,382
I changed it
to a sensible sedan.

224
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:07,984
Okay, but the sunroof
stays open.

225
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:09,152
There is no sunroof.

226
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:11,221
Why did you even become a cop?

227
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,623
Oh, great job, kids.

228
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:15,825
Don't solve too many crimes
and put me out of business.

229
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,994
Terry's got to pay the rent.

230
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:22,332
Dr. Susman wants
a private chat with me.

231
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:24,400
Thanks for warming her up,
Santiago.

232
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:25,835
They didn't give
eighth grade Amy

233
00:08:25,836 --> 00:08:28,338
the key to the teacher's lounge
just for nothing.

234
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,440
I stocked their fridge
and cleaned up after them.

235
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:32,976
Great. So can you take over
with the kids for a minute?

236
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,410
They're done with this activity.

237
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:37,747
Of course.
I am amazing with kids.

238
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:40,250
Okay.

239
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:41,451
I am terrible with kids.

240
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:43,353
I haven't listened to rap music
in three years.

241
00:08:43,354 --> 00:08:45,188
I don't know the lingo.
You have to do this.

242
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,457
I can't... McKenzie is
in the bathroom right now

243
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,326
freaking out because Kelsey S.
made out with Hayes

244
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,962
even though she knows
Brianna's into him.

245
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,198
So unless you want
the spring dance

246
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:59,035
to be a total drama fest,
I have to be there for her.

247
00:08:59,036 --> 00:09:01,604
Honestly, you should show them
a picture of a dead body.

248
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:05,408
No! Rosa, Terry said
to keep it kid-friendly.

249
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:08,311
Okay, I'll just show them
the stuff that I was into

250
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:09,379
when I was their age.

251
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,114
- I'm done.
- What do we do now?

252
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:13,383
- What's next?
- Hello, friends.

253
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,618
Who here would like to see
a presentation

254
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:16,820
about crime statistics

255
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:19,389
as a function
of demographics and time?

256
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:24,694
Who wants to see
a picture of a dead body?

257
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:26,162
Me!

258
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,567
Bludsoe lives at the end
of his hall.

259
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,236
Hmm... I would have preferred
an abandoned lighthouse

260
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:35,672
or a dilapidated barn, but I can
embellish in my memoirs.

261
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:37,107
Oh, I can't wait
to read that book.

262
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:38,641
What are you gonna call it?

263
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:40,376
"Go Ahead, Jake My Day."

264
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:44,013
No, yours is much better.

265
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:45,715
"Case Closed, Jake Open."

266
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:46,883
- Wow.
- I know.

267
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:48,251
I said yours was better.

268
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,686
Whatever.
Let's just do this.

269
00:09:55,092 --> 00:09:56,659
NYPD. Open up.

270
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:04,934
Hey, check it out.

271
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:06,169
Half-packed suitcase.

272
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,704
Looks like Bludsoe
was planning a trip

273
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:09,205
until he got
interrupted by someone.

274
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:10,774
- Or something.
- Like what?

275
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,509
I don't know... I just thought
it would help the intrigue.

276
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:13,610
It did.

277
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:14,677
That's enough chitchat already.

278
00:10:14,712 --> 00:10:16,079
Come on, how many people
have to get killed

279
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,447
before you start having fun?

280
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:19,449
You do know it's our job
to stop the killing, right?

281
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,217
Wait a second.

282
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:22,719
I think I smell a dead body.

283
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:27,123
Nope. My mistake.

284
00:10:27,158 --> 00:10:28,525
Wait! Don't close that.

285
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,026
Look. Handprint.

286
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,362
That's a fake wall.

287
00:10:32,363 --> 00:10:33,663
NYPD.

288
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:35,732
Come out with your hands
on your head.

289
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,434
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.

290
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,902
He's trying to kill me.

291
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:41,371
So I guess, if I had
to sum them up,

292
00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:43,239
Cagney is the intellectual one,

293
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:47,811
whereas Lacey is more
of your traditional prodigy.

294
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:50,313
Well, your daughters
sound great.

295
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:53,116
You know, I'm gonna look over
their applications again.

296
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,617
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

297
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:55,852
It's Jeffords with two Fs.

298
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:58,455
But what really matters
is that your students

299
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:00,490
have an amazing
experience here today.

300
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:03,159
They are.

301
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,161
Look, Rosa.
Sarge is here.

302
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,296
Oh, my God.

303
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,100
Children, get out
of this room immediately.

304
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,301
Let's go.

305
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,069
What the hell, guys?

306
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,104
They're 12 years old.

307
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,406
I would've killed to have seen
a bag of hands at that age.

308
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:18,775
I'm so sorry... I tired to be
myself and they hated it.

309
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:21,544
- Where were you?
- Saving the day.

310
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:23,146
Hayes is out of the picture.

311
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:26,249
The McKenzie/Kelsey S.
beef is squashed,

312
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,184
and Brianna's going
to the dance with Aidan,

313
00:11:28,185 --> 00:11:30,620
who's a much better match
for her anyway, BT-dubs.

314
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:32,789
How does any of that help me?

315
00:11:32,823 --> 00:11:35,425
- Dr. Susman...
- Good-bye, Sergeant Jeffords.

316
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:37,160
I think this experience has been

317
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:38,528
more than enough
for the children.

318
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:39,996
We're done here.

319
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,032
I was walking home
from the coffee shop.

320
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,800
I have a job
bussing tables there.

321
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:47,037
Anyway, the next thing I know,
Mikey D has a gun in my back.

322
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,505
Michael D'Angelo,
the other member

323
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:49,672
of the Fulton Street Four.

324
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:51,641
Yes, believe it or not,
I familiarized myself

325
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:53,410
with the names
of all two suspects

326
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,612
in this high-profile homicide
we're investigating.

327
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:57,881
I fought him off,
but he got my key.

328
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,015
What's the key for?

329
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,350
Each of us had one,

330
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:02,352
and you needed all four
to open the safe.

331
00:12:02,386 --> 00:12:04,054
And what's in the safe?

332
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:05,688
The $21 million.

333
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:06,790
Bing... pot...

334
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:07,991
Nope... I was gonna say bingo,

335
00:12:07,992 --> 00:12:09,359
but then I was like,
"Jackpot's better,"

336
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,494
but then it was too late;
I was halfway through the word.

337
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:13,329
Bingpot works.
It's taking off.

338
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,131
It's taking off.

339
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:18,368
Captain, D'Angelo
has a place upstate.

340
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:20,537
The local sheriff says there's
a car in the driveway right now.

341
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:21,805
He must be there.

342
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,440
Okay, they're gonna have to
raid the place without us.

343
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,641
It'll take us two hours
to get up there.

344
00:12:24,675 --> 00:12:25,675
Or we could take...

345
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:26,910
We are not taking a helicopter.

346
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,311
You know I was
gonna say chopper.

347
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,946
Look, Peralta,
I know you're having fun,

348
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,381
but a helicopter
is exactly the kind

349
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:33,183
of wasteful expenditure
that Wuntch will use

350
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,718
to bury me
if something goes wrong.

351
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,219
- Okay, sir...
- Or...

352
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,356
It's the kind of thing
she'll crucify me for not getting.

353
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:40,890
"You could've had
a chopper, Raymond.

354
00:12:40,891 --> 00:12:42,192
"Why didn't you take advantage?

355
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:43,993
Just a minute...
my cauldron's boiling over."

356
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:46,162
Yeah, but what
she actually said was,

357
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,164
"Chopper's yours, Peralta."

358
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,499
Your impression was better.

359
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,767
What did you do?

360
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,602
She may have called me
and I may have briefed her

361
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:53,903
and she may have
said yes to the chopper

362
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:55,705
because it's definitely
on its way right now!

363
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:57,601
I call middle seat!

364
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:00,621
Whoo!

365
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:03,758
This is awesome!

366
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,661
Okay, just so we're clear,
from this point forward,

367
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:08,529
my call sign
will be Death Blade.

368
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,197
And I'll be Rum Tum Tugger.

369
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:12,667
No, Boyle.
No characters from Cats.

370
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,435
Dig deep.
Think of something scary.

371
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:15,536
Adolf Hitler.

372
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,804
No!

373
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:19,106
You will be...
Sidewinder.

374
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:20,975
All right, but I'm more scared
of Hitler.

375
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:22,777
How about you, Captain?
What's your call sign?

376
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,545
I will be Captain Raymond Holt.

377
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:26,113
Uh-huh, I knew
you wouldn't play ball.

378
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,616
And that is why your call sign
is Wet Blanket.

379
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,319
Sidewinder, this is Death Blade.

380
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,421
Do you copy, Sidewinder?
Over.

381
00:13:33,422 --> 00:13:35,423
This is Sidewinder, Death Blade.

382
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:37,325
I read you loud and clear.
Over.

383
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:39,527
Do you have a 20
on Wet Blanket, Sidewinder?

384
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,561
Over.

385
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:42,597
- I do have a visual...
- Over.

386
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:45,066
All right, look, Captain,
Wuntch said that we could have

387
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,400
anything we needed
to solve this case.

388
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:47,702
Yes, but why?

389
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:50,304
To catch a murderer
who stole $21 million.

390
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,273
No, it's so that when
we do fail,

391
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,376
it'll be that much
more spectacular.

392
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,912
If we don't get D'Angelo,
my career is over.

393
00:13:57,946 --> 00:14:03,184
But if we do catch him,
your career will really take off.

394
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:05,219
Chopper pun!

395
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:08,222
Dr. Susman, I am so, so sorry.

396
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,024
Please don't hold this
against my daughters.

397
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:11,826
I would never do that.

398
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,127
Preschool admissions are based

399
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:14,428
on what we think of the parents.

400
00:14:14,463 --> 00:14:15,496
Oh, no.

401
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:16,564
Dr. Susman...

402
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,832
Nancy, if I may...

403
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,800
- You may not.
- Okay.

404
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:22,570
Look, our methods may have been
a little unorthodox,

405
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,005
and perhaps a little...

406
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,373
Graphic and disgusting.

407
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,308
I was gonna go with yucky...

408
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,510
But these kids had fun today.

409
00:14:29,544 --> 00:14:30,745
And they learned a lot.

410
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,380
Tricia, what's Luminol?

411
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,415
It's used to look for blood
in a crime scene.

412
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,117
Even if a criminal
tried to clean it up,

413
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:38,119
the iron in blood
makes the chemical glow.

414
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,555
And, Bobby, what's enucleation?

415
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,423
It's when someone
pops your eyeball out.

416
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:44,292
Probably should've used
a less gross example.

417
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:45,526
The point is,

418
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,828
this is exactly the kind
of educational experience

419
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,397
I loved about my magnet school.

420
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,232
Well, there's something
to be said for that.

421
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:54,702
Also, and more importantly,
I got McKenzie and Brianna

422
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:56,304
to stop hating on Kelsey S.

423
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:58,706
And now they're best friends...
you're welcome.

424
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:00,107
Wow, that's actually impressive.

425
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,108
Thank you.

426
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:02,643
So, Dr. Susman,

427
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:05,313
let's just call this field trip
what it was...

428
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:06,480
a huge success.

429
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:08,382
It was... interesting.

430
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,218
I saw a prostitute.

431
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:11,552
Not helping, kid.

432
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:34,408
I'm Death Blade.

433
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:45,386
D'Angelo's place
is just beyond those trees.

434
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:47,121
No one's gone in our out.

435
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:48,923
Good thing we got here in time.

436
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:50,390
Flew in on a chopper.

437
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,393
Bell 412 or the A119 Koala?

438
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:54,428
It's classified.

439
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,230
Actually, it was the 350B2.

440
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:57,565
Nice.

441
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:58,866
No, don't give him the "nice."

442
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,535
We haven't seen
any movement in the house,

443
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:01,969
but there are lights on
in the barn.

444
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,070
There's a barn?

445
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,539
What is your fascination
with barns?

446
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,440
It's where all the awesome
stand-offs happen...

447
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:09,110
rusty farm equipment, light
shining through bullet holes.

448
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:11,512
I'll bet you at least one dove
takes flight in slo-mo.

449
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,447
I will take that bet,
because that's impossible.

450
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:14,928
We've got a team
on the back entrance,

451
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,485
a team watching the house,
and a marksman on that hill.

452
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:19,420
Okay, tell your men
if they find the money first,

453
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:21,088
that I get to riffle it
next to my ear and go,

454
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,156
"It's all here."

455
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:23,858
- Already told them, Jake.
- Love you, bud.

456
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:25,560
All right, let's lock and load.

457
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:36,938
Dope.

458
00:16:42,511 --> 00:16:45,246
Moved faster than I was expecting,
but still cool.

459
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:46,647
I don't see him.

460
00:16:46,682 --> 00:16:48,416
Oh, he's here.

461
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:49,416
I can feel it.

462
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:50,885
He is.
He's dead.

463
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,854
- What?
- The body is right here.

464
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,691
Damn it!
Bludsoe played us.

465
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:01,829
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

466
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,431
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Peralta.

467
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:04,765
Is Bludsoe still in custody?

468
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,901
Yeah, we got him.
He's in his...

469
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:10,104
Ooh.

470
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:19,514
So... good news first.

471
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:23,518
We're gonna be flying back
past a beautiful sunset.

472
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,653
Bad news... Bludsoe escaped
from the hospital

473
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:26,787
and we're all screwed.

474
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:30,272
But... Pretty sunset.

475
00:17:31,348 --> 00:17:32,769
Oh, man, look at the captain.

476
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,614
He's pacing slowly.

477
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:37,226
For him, that's like a full-on,
rage-fueled freak out.

478
00:17:37,227 --> 00:17:40,529
The only thing worse is when
he stands perfectly still.

479
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,264
Oh, no, he's standing
perfectly still.

480
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,945
All right, I'm gonna go
talk to him.

481
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:45,167
Mm, no I'm not.

482
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:47,837
Yep, I am.
No, I'm not gonna do it.

483
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:49,004
Okay, I am.
I'm gonna go.

484
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,306
Okay.
Be careful.

485
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:52,475
- You're so brave.
- Thanks.

486
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:54,777
Hey, Captain.

487
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:55,945
What you thinking about?

488
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:58,314
Mostly about how Madeline Wuntch
will destroy me

489
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:00,616
because you wanted a helicopter
to play action movie.

490
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,786
I needed the helicopter
because I was chasing a bad guy

491
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:04,920
because I'm a cop.

492
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,123
Really? It wasn't just
to make this case epic?

493
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:08,691
This case is epic.

494
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:11,227
You're just too wrapped up
in the politics to see it.

495
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:13,295
Sir, we're tracking
a triple murderer

496
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:14,764
who stole $21 million,

497
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,366
and all you can think about
is Madeline Wuntch.

498
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,204
- You're right.
- What's that now?

499
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:24,206
Before I came to the Nine-Nine,

500
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:25,741
I was rotting away behind a desk

501
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:27,209
in the public relations
department.

502
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,779
All I wanted was the chance
to do good police work again.

503
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,684
I just got it, and I blew it
thinking about that devil toad.

504
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,953
I'm tired of politics.

505
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:40,456
Let's get that punk!
Bludsoe.

506
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,358
This is amazing.

507
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,826
Of course, we have no idea
where he is,

508
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,027
but I love where your head's at.

509
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:46,162
He has no family.

510
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:47,329
Maybe there was a girlfriend

511
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,098
or someone he worked with
at the coffee shop.

512
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,533
The coffee shop...
why would someone

513
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:52,535
who knows they have
$21 million coming

514
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,070
take a minimum wage job?

515
00:18:54,104 --> 00:18:56,472
Because he needed
access to that building.

516
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,174
Because that's where
the money's hidden.

517
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,375
All right, we got
to get there quick.

518
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:00,743
Maybe we should
take the chopper.

519
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:03,012
You said chopper.

520
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:06,682
Death Blade, Sidewinder,
it's go time!

521
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:07,983
Roger that, Wet Blanket.

522
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:10,653
No, from now on, call me...

523
00:19:10,654 --> 00:19:14,090
Velvet Thunder.

524
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:16,192
Okay.

525
00:19:17,494 --> 00:19:20,563
Hey, Cagney and Lacey
got off the wait list.

526
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:22,365
Thank you, guys, for helping me.

527
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,233
Rosa, I should've
listened to you.

528
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:25,668
Yeah, everyone should
listen to me

529
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:26,902
all the time about everything.

530
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:29,105
It was pretty fun.
The kids actually liked me.

531
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:30,573
I wish I could go back
to middle school

532
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:31,573
knowing what I know now.

533
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:33,642
I'd be so cool.

534
00:19:33,643 --> 00:19:35,611
And I'd get to retake
all the tests.

535
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:37,246
And update some book reports.

536
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,683
Oh, uh, Gina, Dr. Susman said

537
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,718
you had a real impact
on those kids.

538
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,620
Apparently, you were just named

539
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,389
Spring Dance Princess somehow.

540
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:48,991
Mm-hmm, what am
I always telling you guys?

541
00:19:48,992 --> 00:19:50,359
I'm royalty.

542
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,128
All right, listen up.

543
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:53,796
We go in strong
and we go in fast.

544
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,431
Evans, you're on door breach.

545
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,799
Patterson...
flashbang.

546
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,834
Boyle, stop squatting like that.

547
00:19:58,835 --> 00:20:00,136
Sorry, I thought it looked cool.

548
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,671
- It didn't.
- On the count of three.

549
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,940
It's Bludsoe!

550
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:06,942
- NYPD!
- Go, go, go!

551
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:08,344
Facedown, flat on the ground!

552
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:10,112
Hey, over here, over here.

553
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,485
Bingpot!

554
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,424
This rules.

555
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:23,359
Did you know that my dream
has always been to have

556
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,394
my picture taken with a mountain
of recovered cash?

557
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:26,562
And it's always been my dream

558
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:27,997
to take that picture
of you, Jake.

559
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:29,598
- Oh.
- Yeah.

560
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,900
Yeah!

561
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,102
$21 million, Raymond.

562
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:35,104
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

563
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:36,605
Sorry to disappoint you,
Madeline.

564
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:37,840
I know you'd hoped we'd fail.

565
00:20:37,874 --> 00:20:39,942
Oh, no, I couldn't be happier.

566
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:42,278
Wait...
Why would you say that?

567
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:47,149
And why aren't you clenching
your little rat hands in anger?

568
00:20:49,252 --> 00:20:51,020
You didn't want me to fail.

569
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:52,321
You wanted me to succeed.

570
00:20:52,356 --> 00:20:53,823
That's right.

571
00:20:53,824 --> 00:20:56,626
I was looking for an excuse
to promote you to a desk job,

572
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:58,861
and you handed it to me
on a silver platter

573
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:00,196
with your little rat hands.

574
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,364
Oh, no.

575
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:03,532
Say good-bye
to the Nine-Nine, Raymond.

576
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:07,003
I'm making you head
of NYPD Public Relations.

577
00:21:07,037 --> 00:21:09,505
Captain, get in here with me.

578
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,707
Go ahead.
Smile for the cameras, Raymond.

579
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,643
That's your new job now.

580
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:16,345
Hey!

581
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,114
Okay, quick,
let's pose back-to-back

582
00:21:18,115 --> 00:21:20,182
with our arms crossed
and a cocky smirk.

583
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,919
You doing it?
Your arms crossed?

584
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,521
No, arms down.
That's good.
