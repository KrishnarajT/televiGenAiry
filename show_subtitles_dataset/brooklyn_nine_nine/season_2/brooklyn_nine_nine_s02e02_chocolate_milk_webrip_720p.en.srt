1
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:03,461
Okay, great.

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,930
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks, doctor.

3
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:09,000
Have a good one.

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:10,301
Hey there, sarge.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,502
Not to pry but I couldn't
help but overhear...

6
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:13,346
You're going to the doctor?
Everything okay?

7
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:18,268
I'm getting a vasectomy.

8
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:21,855
My ears are burning.
Did someone say "vasectomy?"

9
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,148
I got snipped.
No big deal.

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,317
Just numbs you out from
trunk to skunk for a year.

11
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,318
It's not supposed to.

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,611
"Trunk to skunk"?

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,621
Hold it up.

14
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:32,256
You're gonna let some quack doctor

15
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,724
just knife around down there?

16
00:00:33,725 --> 00:00:36,694
You are blessed with a great power.

17
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:39,297
And you should never snip its wings.

18
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:41,291
You should let it soar.

19
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:44,402
Thanks guys, that's enough.
I don't need anymore input.

20
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:46,379
Neither does your wife, I guess.

21
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:47,705
Look, you guys,

22
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:49,373
if the sergeant wants
to chop off his penis,

23
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:50,708
that is his choice.

24
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,143
That's not what a vasectomy is.

25
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:53,377
If you guys don't get back to work,

26
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:55,313
I'm gonna start firing detectives.

27
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:57,248
And blanks!

28
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:58,850
Sorry.
I just never think of jokes.

29
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,485
Anybody else?
This is your last chance.

30
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:04,355
Oh, God.
No need to be so testes.

31
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,724
Guess you won't be
manning the "tip line."

32
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,126
Sergeant, is this gonna go
on your "sperm-anent record"?

33
00:01:09,127 --> 00:01:10,236
Now playing:

34
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,529
"Scrotal recall"!

35
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,337

36
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,417
Hey sarge, great news.

37
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:36,654
I just got assigned
such a dope stabbing.

38
00:01:36,655 --> 00:01:38,222
Sorry, the stabbing part is bad.

39
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,644
The guy survived and he owns
a chocolate milk restaurant.

40
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:44,662
- Seriously?
- I know, right?

41
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:45,663
Finally, a dumb Brooklyn hipster trend

42
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,531
my mouth and I can get behind.

43
00:01:47,532 --> 00:01:48,532
Wanna hop on the case with me?

44
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,867
We're a killer team.

45
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,002
Jeffords and Peralta.

46
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:52,103
Jake and Terry.

47
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:53,279
Chocolate and milk.

48
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,473
I mean, I'm the chocolate

49
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:57,208
and you're the milk 'cause
you're so full of protein!

50
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,744
Don't be mad!
Just do the case!

51
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,046
Okay, but I have my vasectomy today.

52
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,514
So I need to be back in a few hours

53
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:05,149
to catch my ride to the doctor's.

54
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,450
My neighbor's driving me

55
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,686
because my wife's out of town
with the girls.

56
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:10,054
Why don't I drive you?

57
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,589
I don't know.

58
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,550
I guess I didn't really think
of you as that kind of friend.

59
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:15,192
Sarge, I'm every kind of friend.

60
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:18,062
I'm Phoebe, I'm Chandler,
I'm Rachel, I'm...

61
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:19,163
Who's the dinosaur guy?

62
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:21,099
Ross, bro!
Ross!

63
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:23,467
Sorry, I forgot you were
such a ross-head.

64
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:25,136
So look, we'll work this thing together

65
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:27,672
and afterwards,
I will be your friend chariot

66
00:02:27,673 --> 00:02:29,816
to the penis-removal
of the century.

67
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:33,678
The new NYPD commissioner is planning

68
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,613
a complete reorganization of the force.

69
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,281
But first, he'll be sending
a deputy chief

70
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,951
to every precinct to conduct
a top to bottom evaluation.

71
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:42,620
What? When?
Are we gonna be graded?

72
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,255
Or is this just some pass/fail garbage?

73
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,790
Scale of one-to-five.

74
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,358
That's how many
letter grades there are.

75
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,226
Feels like they're just
being weird using numbers

76
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:50,328
instead of letters.

77
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:51,595
Yeah, they're being weird right now.

78
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:53,030
Boyle.
Diaz.

79
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,666
I want the evidence room
organized beyond reproach.

80
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,268
Santiago, when I greet
the deputy chief,

81
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,871
I want you there by my side
to make a good impression.

82
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:04,008
No offense, but you are
something of a teacher's pet.

83
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,145
None taken!
People love their pets.

84
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,439
Good news is
our evaluation will be done

85
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,349
by deputy chief Brandt.

86
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,277
We have a good rapport.
He was once my captain.

87
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:17,322
So he's kind of like
our grand-captain.

88
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:20,116
That is amazingly funny.

89
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:24,462
Well, I was closing up
around 11:00.

90
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:25,529
I heard the door open.

91
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,299
I just figured it was
some "milkers."

92
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,834
That's what we call our regulars.

93
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,960
Do ya?

94
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:33,337
Anyway, next thing I know,
the guy stabs me in the back

95
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,405
like... like right here!

96
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,407
Like some kind of psycho wuss!

97
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,635
Can you think of anyone
who might wanna harm you?

98
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:40,344
Yeah.

99
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,345
I mean, you don't get
into this line of business

100
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,546
to make friends.

101
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:43,981
Really? I would think
making chocolate milk

102
00:03:43,982 --> 00:03:45,316
is a great way to make friends.

103
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,485
I don't have proof,
but the guy who did this

104
00:03:47,486 --> 00:03:49,887
to me is my business partner,
Gregory Phillips.

105
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,322
He's still pissed at me
because I banned him

106
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:52,556
from my 'straunt.

107
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:54,191
He was supposed to be
my silent partner,

108
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,626
but he wasn't silent.

109
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:57,161
He was trying to control everything.

110
00:03:57,162 --> 00:03:58,488
Here, try this.

111
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,131
All right, here we go.
Finally!

112
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,132
All right.

113
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,703
Oh! Ugh!
It's so bitter!

114
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,371
What's wrong with this chocolate milk?

115
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,998
Dark milk isn't chocolate milk.

116
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,834
This is teat-to-mouth
raw cow's milk.

117
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,310
The bitterness of the chocolate

118
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:15,880
brings out the sourness in the milk.

119
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:18,841
That's the worst part
of both of those things!

120
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:21,386
Uh, time for my appointment, Jake.

121
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:22,520
Yup, got it.

122
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,388
All right, we'll look into this
and get back to you.

123
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,489
Okay, sarge.

124
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,891
Hate to be "that kind of a friend,"

125
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,361
but let's go chop off that penis.

126
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:32,939
Where were you?
This is chaos.

127
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,733
Gina's been filing evidence
by "perp hotness."

128
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,501
I'm so sorry, I just got some bad news.

129
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,470
My sister was gonna go with me
to an engagement party

130
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,905
but she had to cancel.

131
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:43,274
So go alone.
Maybe you'll meet some new bag.

132
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:45,176
It's my ex-wife Eleanor's
engagement party.

133
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:46,677
I can't go alone.

134
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:48,446
I'm worried it might seem
a little pathetic.

135
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:51,081
Yeah, if only you could've
gone with your sister.

136
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,750
Dude, why are you going

137
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,152
to your ex-wife's
engagement party at all?

138
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:58,055
She and her fiance, Hercules,
are also my landlords.

139
00:04:58,056 --> 00:04:59,657
I mean, it's not like I can avoid them.

140
00:04:59,658 --> 00:05:01,959
I live in their basement.

141
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,928
Hey!

142
00:05:03,994 --> 00:05:06,063
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- No.

143
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:07,431
- You could go with me.
- Can't.

144
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,642
- I have a date tomorrow night.
- Okay.

145
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,503
I will figure something out.

146
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:13,571
I know!

147
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:15,372
Maybe if I pay my neighbor, Joann,

148
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:16,983
she'll ditch her wife for the night!

149
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,578
Captain, I don't know
if this is too much

150
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,489
but I got deputy chief Brandt
this little basket of pears.

151
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:27,384
They look ripe and crispy.

152
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:30,386
Hello, Raymond.

153
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:36,294
Captain Wuntch.
Good to see you.

154
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,340
But if you're here,
who's guarding Hades?

155
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,500
It's deputy chief Wuntch now.

156
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:45,102
Unsurprisingly,
I've been promoted above you.

157
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,804
And now I'm here to evaluate you.

158
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,172
What happened to Brandt?

159
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,573
He retired and moved to Charleston

160
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:51,208
to be closer to his grandchildren.

161
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,978
So much for dying at your desk
with a little dignity.

162
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:54,979
Interesting.

163
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:57,348
I will attempt to cooperate with you.

164
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,026
Under these new circumstances.

165
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:02,152
Don't sweet-talk me, Holt.

166
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:06,532
I gave it my best shot.
Let's begin.

167
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,693
Hey, hey!

168
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:10,728
How'd it go?

169
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:11,896
Is his voice
all high-pitched now?

170
00:06:11,897 --> 00:06:13,397
What?
No, of course not.

171
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:14,398
Of course not.

172
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,291
Jake!

173
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:17,627
The doctors made me into a superhero!

174
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,804
I am so strong!

175
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:23,908
And they made me black!

176
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,276
He's on a lot of medication.

177
00:06:25,277 --> 00:06:26,610
We weren't able to do the procedure.

178
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:27,978
Your friend is so large...

179
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,681
That you needed a bigger saw
to get through his dingus?

180
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:33,450
No, his body is so physically massive

181
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:36,120
that we didn't have
enough anesthesia on hand.

182
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:37,438
He needs a much larger dose.

183
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,790
Psst... psst...
Jake.

184
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,660
Sometimes I can't tell
my twin baby girls apart,

185
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:44,528
so I call them both
"boo-boo."

186
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,449
Wow.
So he has no filter whatsoever?

187
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:49,433
None.

188
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,168
I'm gonna take ya home now, sarge.

189
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,504
Hey, what do you think of captain Holt?

190
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:55,123
He needs to smoke some weed.

191
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,006
Yes!

192
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,075
Thank you, Dr. Penis-off!

193
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:01,278
Okay, in ya go.
You're okay.

194
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,747
Whoo! Cool!

195
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:08,052
Dude, your head is so small!

196
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:09,286
Like a...

197
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:12,556
No, no, it's so small!

198
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,557
All right.

199
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,477
Where do you keep your brains?

200
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:19,981
Good.

201
00:07:20,047 --> 00:07:22,566
All right, got your PJS on,
read you a story,

202
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,034
checked under the bed for monsters.

203
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:25,202
Check again!

204
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:27,822
And now it's sleepy-time,
so here we go...

205
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:30,867
Wait, wait, wait...

206
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,410
You gotta promise me you won't let them

207
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,746
give me the operation.

208
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,709
I wanna have more kids.
I don't want the vasectomy.

209
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:41,852
Promise me, tiny head!
Promise me!

210
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:44,213
All right, I promise!
I promise.

211
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,923
Good!

212
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,177
Because I'm not done
with my testicles yet.

213
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:50,428
Okay.

214
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:53,030
I'm gonna let them sing!

215
00:07:59,137 --> 00:08:01,204
Uh-oh,
walk of shame!

216
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,073
Same clothes as yesterday.

217
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,365
I slept at the sarge's.

218
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,709
It was horrible.

219
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,479
Come... here...
Phone!

220
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,648
All right, let's get going
and interview that suspect.

221
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:14,284
I have my make-up vasectomy
this afternoon so...

222
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,319
I'm sorry,
your what-what vasectomy?

223
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,654
Last night, you told me
you didn't want that.

224
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:18,855
Then you fell on top of me

225
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:20,459
and changed the shape
of my skeleton forever.

226
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,428
No, I definitely want one.

227
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,597
That was the drugs talking.
I was high as a kite.

228
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,139
- Did I do this and call you "tiny head?"
- Yes.

229
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,897
Some things are coming back to me now.

230
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:37,342
Oh, that's great.

231
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:39,211
Tiny head.

232
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:41,580
Jake, I am so scared
that man is about to make

233
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:44,616
a huge mistake,
re: His vas deferens.

234
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:47,586
I know, he made me promise
to not let him get that surgery.

235
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:50,656
And it wasn't just the drugs.
He doesn't want this.

236
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:54,082
As his friend, it's my job to stop him.

237
00:08:57,397 --> 00:09:01,033
Sorry, Terry turned my spine
into a loose stack of pebbles.

238
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:04,536
And since my arrival,
violent crime has gone down

239
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:08,206
by 17.3%,
as you can see here.

240
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,509
Two-toned graphs?

241
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,744
You think you can distract me
from the precinct's problems

242
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,644
with a flashy presentation?

243
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,813
Same old Ray Holt.

244
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,850
All sizzle, no steak.

245
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:20,900
I'm off to do
some spot-checks.

246
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:24,890
Oh, my God.
She's totally gonna flunk us.

247
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,291
I haven't gotten an "F"

248
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:28,160
since I failed recess in second grade.

249
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:29,928
"Teachers need a break too,
Amy."

250
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,198
We were doomed the minute
she slithered into the precinct.

251
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:35,790
It's funny.
When we first met,

252
00:09:35,802 --> 00:09:37,568
we had some good times.

253
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:42,123
Looks like we both want that stapler.

254
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,892
Seems that way based on what happened.

255
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,731
So when did it all go south?

256
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:52,801
1989. I was up
for a big promotion,

257
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,669
which would've fast-tracked
my career.

258
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,238
Wuntch offered to write
a letter on my behalf

259
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:59,207
but instead, she torpedoed me
because of something

260
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,909
that happened the night before
she was to turn it in.

261
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,012
Madeline.

262
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:07,816
Would you care for a drink?

263
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:08,984
I'd love one.

264
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,052
I'm sure you can tell I'm quite drunk.

265
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,922
I've had a couple
to build up the nerve.

266
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:17,092
I think we both know
what I'm about to say.

267
00:10:17,093 --> 00:10:18,708
Raymond...

268
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:21,095
I don't think we need to say anything.

269
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,257
I'm gay.

270
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:28,803
That's what I was going to tell you.

271
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:30,428
Well, then.

272
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:35,600
She sabotaged my career
because I refused to bed her.

273
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:39,747
He thinks I stabbed him?
That's crazy.

274
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:42,183
He said you were furious
at him because he banned you

275
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,219
from the restaurant
and called your business plans

276
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
"terrible."

277
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:46,654
The text reads:

278
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,124
"Your ideas are dumb-dumb
batter in a stupid pancake,

279
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,461
you steaming pile
of human fences."

280
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:56,264
I assume that was
auto-corrected from "feces."

281
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:59,467
Look, partners fight.
He's difficult to work with,

282
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:01,417
but I would never try and kill him.

283
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,938
Where were you on monday
around 10:00 pm?

284
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,507
Me and my business school
buddies get together

285
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,642
every monday and have a couple beers.

286
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,611
Also, there's a... uh...
Pilates studio

287
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:10,979
with a huge window across the street

288
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,482
so it's a pretty sweet view.

289
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:16,117
I guess that's not as bad
as stabbing someone?

290
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:17,919
I left around 10:00,

291
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,954
I took the subway home,
got off at York street,

292
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:22,605
around my house, puked on
a statue, went to bed.

293
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,793
Classy. All right, well, we've
taken up enough of your time

294
00:11:25,794 --> 00:11:27,829
enjoy the rest of your day
and go back to your life

295
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,612
as "a pile
of human fences."

296
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:31,499
Okay, let's see if
any of DRK MLK's neighbors

297
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,967
saw the pilates perv or anyone else

298
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,769
fleeing the scene of the crime.

299
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,137
Copy that.

300
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:37,572
We'll do some cop stuff,
have a heart-to-heart

301
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,640
about your vasectomy,
cancel your vasectomy,

302
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:39,774
grab some drinks, laugh about the time

303
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,809
you almost got a vasectomy.

304
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,878
Stop worrying about my vasectomy, man.

305
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,780
Maybe you should focus
on your own body.

306
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:47,181
When's the last time you had a carrot?

307
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:49,884
Well, it's my least favorite
type of cake, so rarely.

308
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:52,120
If I absolutely have to,
I'll just eat the frosting.

309
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:54,188
Hey!
Cut it out, cake boy.

310
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,690
You're making health
insurance more expensive

311
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:57,125
for everyone else!

312
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:59,460
Yeah? Well, you know what
else drives up premiums?

313
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,462
Unwanted genital removal!

314
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:05,133
Thank you for coming.

315
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,267
I wasn't sure if you'd get my message.

316
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,935
Charles, it was kind of hard to miss.

317
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:11,237
Oh, God!

318
00:12:11,303 --> 00:12:12,774
Hey, I didn't know what to do.

319
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,808
You said we weren't
allowed to talk at work

320
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:15,366
now that we're knocking boots.

321
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:16,611
Ew, gross.

322
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,780
Listen,
my ex-wife's throwing

323
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,014
an engagement party this weekend

324
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:22,116
and I was wondering
if you wanted to go...

325
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,518
As friends.

326
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,188
No, Charles, just because
we have secret, shameful sex

327
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:29,130
does not mean we are friends.

328
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:31,225
Forget friends.
Let's go as "bone bros."

329
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:32,727
Ugh!

330
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:35,096
I didn't strike you when
you said "knocking boots,"

331
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:40,001
but "bone bros"?
I cannot abide.

332
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:41,893
Have you seen this man around DRK MLK.

333
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,871
Oh, I don't go there.

334
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:45,521
They don't allow babies in there.

335
00:12:45,587 --> 00:12:47,208
What is wrong with them?

336
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,477
All I drank when I was a baby
was chocolate milk.

337
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,069
Well, thank you for your time.

338
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:52,947
And thank you, adorable little baby,

339
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:54,282
who's probably giving my partner

340
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:56,150
some mixed feelings right about now.

341
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,186
"Don't get the operation, sarge!

342
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:00,588
Instead, make a tiny muscular
friend for me to play with!"

343
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:01,789
That's enough.

344
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,790
I'm with you.
That's enough, baby.

345
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,166
Mind your own business.

346
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:07,729
I haven't heard of DRK MLK

347
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,530
and I've never seen this man before.

348
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:11,866
This is your lead?
Why are we here?

349
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,668
Well, according to the Internet,

350
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:15,737
Dr. Mindel is the best
couples counselor

351
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:18,139
in the Park slope area, who
accepts same day walk-ins.

352
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,607
Couples counseling?

353
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:21,075
Sorry for wasting your time.

354
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:22,892
Wait, please don't leave.

355
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,980
This cost me so much money.

356
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:27,647
I am so sorry.

357
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:29,817
He's walking out.

358
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:31,234
Just like your father did.

359
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,287
Wait a minute,
I didn't tell you about that.

360
00:13:33,288 --> 00:13:34,622
Didn't have to.

361
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:37,759
You are good!

362
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,577
Sarge, wait up!
Come on, don't be mad!

363
00:13:41,643 --> 00:13:43,197
Look, I'm only trying to protect you

364
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,932
from your very stupid self.

365
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:46,668
That is enough, Jake!

366
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,202
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

367
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,637
And the things you said
when you were whacked-out

368
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:50,772
were real.

369
00:13:50,773 --> 00:13:53,307
You made me promise.
And as your friend...

370
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:54,509
I told you, Jake.

371
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,077
We're not that kind of friends.

372
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:57,979
Not what kind of friends?

373
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,013
"Friend" friends.

374
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,596
You and I are work friends.

375
00:14:00,662 --> 00:14:02,765
Now, if you will excuse me,

376
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:05,143
I'm going to the doctor's office.

377
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,923
Not good enough.

378
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:12,293
Prepare to be physically
overpowered by a "friend" friend.

379
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:13,442
Argh!

380
00:14:13,508 --> 00:14:15,797
Cancel the appointment!
I've got you!

381
00:14:15,798 --> 00:14:17,298
You can't move.

382
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:19,448
Concede defeat, sir.

383
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:21,568
You have been conquered.

384
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:24,501
Spot-checks are done.

385
00:14:24,502 --> 00:14:26,703
Needless to say,
I thoroughly underwhelmed.

386
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:27,904
Huh.
From your expression,

387
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:31,341
I would've guessed
constipated or chilly.

388
00:14:31,342 --> 00:14:33,443
Excuse me, captain, I don't want to say

389
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:37,213
that I saved the day,
but I will because I did.

390
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:39,082
So...

391
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:43,018
The letter of recommendation
she wrote for you 25 years ago.

392
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,612
Where'd you get this?

393
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,014
I just went down to one police plaza

394
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:49,716
and applied some
of my signature Amy charm.

395
00:14:49,717 --> 00:14:52,185
And then when you wouldn't stop,
they just gave it to you?

396
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:53,987
More or less.

397
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:56,223
The point is,
the letter's very positive.

398
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:58,458
You thought she wrote
mean stuff about you

399
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:01,261
because of the...
Night before.

400
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:03,797
But she didn't.
It was all a misunderstanding.

401
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:05,465
Wait a minute...

402
00:15:05,935 --> 00:15:08,435
You thought I cost you that
promotion because you're gay?

403
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:11,241
That's what you've been mad
about all these years?

404
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,577
It's... one reason.

405
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,813
I don't care that
you rejected my advances.

406
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,748
Your sexual identity is the one thing

407
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,783
I actually respect about you.

408
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:21,618
Then what are you mad about?

409
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:24,788
I'm mad because you tried
to get me thrown off the force.

410
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,090
Yeah, because you shot me.

411
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,026
I shot you because you were
in the wrong position.

412
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:30,461
You weren't following orders.

413
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,262
What about the time you
destroyed my personnel file

414
00:15:32,263 --> 00:15:33,263
while I was undercover?

415
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:34,465
What if there had been a mole?

416
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,833
You were trying to make me disappear.

417
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,835
You embarrassed me
in front of Derek Jeter!

418
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:43,490
You embarrassed yourself
in front of Derek Jeter.

419
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:49,329
Hey, Rosa!

420
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:53,167
Better file me under "E"
for "edgy."

421
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,252
- What?
- Cornrows!

422
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:56,553
Why?

423
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:59,022
My ex-wife and her fiance
go to Jamaica all the time.

424
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:01,825
The theme of their party is:
"Jamaican me marry you."

425
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,060
So good!

426
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,394
So...

427
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:06,730
I still don't have a date.

428
00:16:06,731 --> 00:16:09,016
Unless this sweet maize-head
has changed your mind.

429
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:10,667
I think we both know it hasn't.

430
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:11,668
We do.

431
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:12,811
Fair enough.

432
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,140
Why do you look so terrible?

433
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,809
I tried to stop sarge
from getting his tubes tied.

434
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,245
But he somehow managed to
sneak off to the hospital.

435
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,113
Zip that lip!
He's doing it?

436
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,349
He wouldn't listen to me.
He said I was a "work friend."

437
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,752
Ah, that chills me.
And it reminds me of a story.

438
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,454
I had this sweater,
and it was a work sweater

439
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,623
because it only seemed work apropes,

440
00:16:32,689 --> 00:16:35,559
but then one time,
I wore it out to dinner

441
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,995
and I was like, "oh, dang!

442
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:40,005
This sweater is cute
everywhere."

443
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,342
I get it.
I'm the sweater.

444
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:44,368
No.

445
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:45,369
And I have to show the sarge
I can be a good friend

446
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,837
to him outside of work too.

447
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:47,838
No!

448
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,839
Thank you, Gina.

449
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,174
I'm gonna stop him.

450
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,241
Jake, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

451
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,576
but good luck!

452
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,103
Well, good-bye, Raymond.

453
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,730
Anything you'd like to say to me

454
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:58,190
before I complete my evaluation?

455
00:16:58,256 --> 00:17:00,384
Something in the form of groveling?

456
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:03,654
Never.
Fail me if you must.

457
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,393
You're just gonna let her fail us?

458
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,195
I'm sorry about your
precious grade, Santiago,

459
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,163
but this isn't about you.

460
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:14,765
Don't "this isn't about you" me!

461
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:17,701
I'm "this isn't
about you"-ing you!

462
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,037
That grade is the only thing
standing between me

463
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,039
and a future where you're
not my captain anymore.

464
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,591
Wuntch failed the nine-oh
and their captain was fired.

465
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,778
I attempted to cajole her
but she rebuffed me.

466
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,881
I'm not a man of unlimited cajoling.

467
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:34,785
Well, you better become one
because I need you in command.

468
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:37,588
This precinct needs you in command.

469
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,423
Cajole up, captain.

470
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,066
Sarge, hey!

471
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:52,703
What the hell
are you doing here, tiny head?

472
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:57,040
You better not be trying to talk
me out of my surgery again.

473
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,575
Look, I'm not trying to
talk you out of anything.

474
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,277
I'm just here to give you a ride home

475
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,112
and to prove to you once and for all

476
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,281
that I'm more than just a work friend.

477
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,583
Thank you, microscope head.

478
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,818
Hey, a little bit of good news!

479
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:08,986
I figured out the case!

480
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,320
Remember Gregory said he got off

481
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,955
at the York street station
the night of the stabbing?

482
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:13,056
Well, I took the subway here

483
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:14,691
and it's closed for construction.

484
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:15,692
Hmm...

485
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,794
So what you're saying is...

486
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:19,796
I stabbed him.

487
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,064
I did it.

488
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,941
You know what?
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

489
00:18:23,007 --> 00:18:25,268
See you on the other side.

490
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,574
Jake, you were right!

491
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:33,043
I don't want the surger, tiny head!

492
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:34,077
NYPD!

493
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,479
Put down the scalpel and step away

494
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,213
from my work friend's
weiner-tubes!

495
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:41,418
Looking good, Boyle!

496
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:43,068
Ugh, that's not a good sign.

497
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:45,197
Hey, mon.

498
00:18:45,198 --> 00:18:47,766
Rosa...
You changed your mind!

499
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,368
I blew off my date, and instead,

500
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,736
I'm going to spend a hellish evening

501
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:52,538
in a Jamaican torture chamber with you.

502
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:53,939
- Really?
- Yeah.

503
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,774
Here's what's about to happen.

504
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:57,109
We're gonna go to this terrible party,

505
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,443
I'm gonna laugh at all your jokes,

506
00:18:58,444 --> 00:18:59,878
gonna talk about your medal of valor,

507
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,580
and I'm gonna make you look
like a Jamaican God of rhythm.

508
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:03,048
Sebastian from the little mermaid.

509
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,901
Also, tomorrow, I'm gonna help
you find a new apartment.

510
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:09,121
You can't live in your
ex-wife's basement anymore.

511
00:19:09,122 --> 00:19:11,573
Wow!
Respect, mon.

512
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:14,259
I'm gonna read you my toast in the car.

513
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,360
You're giving a toast?

514
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:16,601
More like we're giving a toast.

515
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:20,465
There we go.

516
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:22,250
Jake, I have to tell you something.

517
00:19:22,268 --> 00:19:23,635
Oh, boy.

518
00:19:23,636 --> 00:19:26,838
I am a little conflicted
about having a vasectomy.

519
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,006
Really?

520
00:19:28,007 --> 00:19:29,908
Is that why you threw
an EKG machine at the doctor?

521
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,544
I'm sorry I thought of you
as a work friend.

522
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:35,889
You're here, man.
You're a friend friend.

523
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:41,053
You made Terry get real
with himself and his genitals.

524
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:46,925
Your tiny head has
a big heart inside it.

525
00:19:46,926 --> 00:19:49,903
I know that's scientifically
wrong, but thanks, sarge.

526
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:54,299
I'm gonna talk to my wife
when she comes home.

527
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,452
You're a huggy good friend.

528
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:59,470
No! Not again.

529
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,208
Santiago, we received our grade.

530
00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:07,546
Oh, my God.
Is this good-bye?

531
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,414
There's still so much
I have to say to you.

532
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:12,751
2.7.
Mediocre.

533
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:15,187
But enough for you to stick around.

534
00:20:15,188 --> 00:20:17,389
How did you get her to change her mind?

535
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,474
I had to compromise
everything I stand for.

536
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,760
You are now, and always have been,

537
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,762
the superior police officer.

538
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:26,798
And?

539
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,901
The Derek Jeter thing was my fault.

540
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,703
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

541
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:32,838
No, you were right.

542
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,006
This is the best job I've ever had

543
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:38,043
and it would be foolish to
give it up over a petty feud.

544
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:40,812
Here, this is for you.

545
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:42,948
It's a grade for your
performance these past few days.

546
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:45,542
A letter grade, so as
to not be "weird" about it.

547
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:49,488
Oh, my God.
You really shouldn't have.

548
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:51,723
An "A."

549
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:53,258
Thank you.

550
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:55,677
Just curious,
does your system have pluses

551
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:58,930
in it, or is, like, "A" the highest?

552
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:03,135
How'd the interrogation go?

553
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,437
Gregory confessed to the stabbing.

554
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,372
Nice work.

555
00:21:07,373 --> 00:21:08,907
I just talked to my wife.

556
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:11,777
We're waiting on the operation,
everything's cool.

557
00:21:11,778 --> 00:21:13,712
Did you tell her
we slept together twice?

558
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:18,250
Thanks for taking care of me.
I got you a present.

559
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,352
Do you know what a present is, Terry?

560
00:21:20,353 --> 00:21:22,454
I care about my friends.

561
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:25,857
Now eat your carrots, or I'll
rip your tiny head off.

562
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,292
No! No! No!

563
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:28,293
Come here.

564
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:31,848
I hate being friends with you!

565
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:35,816
