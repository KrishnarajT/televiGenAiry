1
00:00:01,492 --> 00:00:02,659
Attention, boys and ghouls.

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:04,294
Nope.

3
00:00:04,329 --> 00:00:06,289
Every Halloween, I dress up
in an amazing costume,

4
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:08,365
- and you never get what I am.
- No, we get what you are...

5
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,800
An adult man
who enjoys dress-up.

6
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:12,102
Very funny, Rosa.

7
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:14,937
This year, that won't be a problem

8
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:17,340
because you're gonna pick my costume.

9
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:22,345
Uh, Ms. Pac-man's nipple.

10
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,980
No, that's brown.

11
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:25,047
Why would you know that?

12
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:28,184
- To be or not to be!
- Not to be.

13
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:29,519
Thank you.

14
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:32,822
Joan of Arc.
Rod Stewart.

15
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:33,823
Martha Stewart.

16
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:36,158
He-man!
Master of the universe.

17
00:00:36,193 --> 00:00:38,160
I got it.
Gay Robin Hood.

18
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:39,328
Yes!

19
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:40,596
That's it, that's it.

20
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:42,865
That's what it is.

22
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:10,026
Oh, hey there, Captain.

23
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:12,528
Just curious, do you happen
to know what today is?

24
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:15,064
Well, based on the fact that
yesterday was the birthday

25
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:17,366
of legendary Dutch flautist
Frans Bruggen,

26
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,969
and a week ago it was october
24th, it's say today is...

27
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,204
It's Halloween.
Just say it's Halloween.

28
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:22,371
It's Halloween.

29
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:24,540
All right, and what
happened last Halloween?

30
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,908
Oh, I listened to the CD
I bought the night before,

31
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,343
the Frans Bruggen birthday concert.

32
00:01:27,377 --> 00:01:29,078
Please stop saying Bruggen.

33
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,481
Last year, you bet me that you
could steal my medal of valor.

34
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,182
And you did.

35
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:35,752
Consequently, I was forced to
do your paperwork for a week

36
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:38,955
and to say words I thought
I'd never have to say.

37
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:43,298
Jake Peralta is an amazing
detective/genius.

38
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,595
But now it's time for round two
of our Halloween bet.

39
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:47,230
This year, I believe I'll make things

40
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:48,831
more difficult for myself.

41
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:53,002
Let's say, what, I'll steal
the watch right off your wrist.

42
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:54,570
Or we could just not do it
at all this year.

43
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,339
What?

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,610
Sir, with all due respect,
come on, homey! No?

45
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:02,011
It's not worth all the trouble,

46
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:04,347
just so you might call me
an amazing captain/genius

47
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:06,682
and give me one week
of overtime for free.

48
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:08,451
All right, fine,
I'll double the overtime.

49
00:02:08,452 --> 00:02:09,519
I'll triple it!

50
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:10,853
I'll quadruple it!

51
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:11,888
I will five-druple it.

52
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:14,538
I'll five-druple the overtime.

53
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:15,558
Got his attention.

54
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,727
He's coming back to me.

55
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,861
Just to clarify.

56
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:20,830
If you steal my watch by midnight,

57
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:22,165
I will do your paperwork for a week,

58
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,067
but if you fail, you will give me

59
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:27,670
five weeks of overtime for free.

60
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,472
Correct.

61
00:02:29,506 --> 00:02:31,674
I'm doing a cost-benefit
analysis in my head.

62
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,810
The benefits outweigh the costs.

63
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:35,445
We have reached an accord.

64
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,813
Accords!

65
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,382
Handing out these safety
pumpkins to neighborhood kids

66
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,617
is a cornerstone
in community relations.

67
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:42,852
And putting them together

68
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:45,254
is a boring-stone
in testing my patience.

69
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:47,924
We can use an assembly line
so it'll go quicker.

70
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,292
Ooh, that's a great idea, Terrence.

71
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,861
However, is there any way
I can skip doing that

72
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:53,629
and instead, not do that?

73
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:56,099
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

74
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,800
Okay, no problem.

75
00:02:57,835 --> 00:02:59,235
Just come back and help us
when you're done.

76
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:00,303
Thank you.

77
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:02,105
I'll leave you guys with this.

78
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,609
One-duhl plus one-duhl equals...
Tootles.

79
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:11,180
Seriously, sarge?
You're just gonna let her go?

80
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,983
Look, a year ago, I would've
been thinking the same thing,

81
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:16,719
but I've learned to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

82
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:17,954
What kind of urgent matter

83
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:19,589
could Gina possibly have to attend to?

84
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,957
She's already checked herself out

85
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,092
in every reflective surface
around the precinct.

86
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:24,894
Including my lip gloss.

87
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:27,230
She said she looked better
when I frowned.

88
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,936
I was behind the door!

89
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,572
Greetings, comrades, and welcome

90
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,975
to the most important
briefing of your lives.

91
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,376
As you all know,

92
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,345
the Holt-Peralta
Halloween bet has been made,

93
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:44,847
and the clock doth tick.

94
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:46,182
What's with the tux?

95
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:47,784
I decided to class up
this year's event.

96
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:49,185
I bought it off a disgraced magician,

97
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,721
and it is chock-full of scarves.

98
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:54,724
What? How?

99
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:56,392
A real magician never tells, young man.

100
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:57,760
Now, let's get started.

101
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,662
I've been planning this
for three months.

102
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,031
You've all been given
a specific role and a code name.

103
00:04:02,066 --> 00:04:03,299
Rosa, you're the dagger.

104
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,034
Sarge, the hammer.

105
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:06,703
Amy, the hall monitor.

106
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,404
Yeah, suck it!

107
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,073
Scully and Hitchcock,
I'm just gonna call you

108
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:11,374
your real names
so you don't get confused.

109
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,209
- Smart.
- What?

110
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,178
And, Boyle, as requested,
you will be the deuce.

111
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:17,313
Although I still think you should
reconsider that code name.

112
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,781
Nope, deuce.

113
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:20,650
It's like ace, but twice as cool.

114
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,085
It is not.
It's a turd.

115
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,686
Now, because of last year,

116
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,221
the captain will suspect
that you are all helping me,

117
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:26,889
so we will never get
anywhere near his watch,

118
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,093
but the actual theft will be pulled off

119
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:34,564
by Dan McCreary, aka "fingers."

120
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,733
How you doing?

121
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,301
Call me "fingers."

122
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:40,169
Hey, I remember this guy.

123
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,604
That's probably because

124
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:42,939
you've arrested him twice
for pickpocketing.

125
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:44,507
You have a criminal helping you?

126
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,142
That's crazy!

127
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,310
Grow up, Amy.

128
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:48,978
Now, we will all
work together as a team

129
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,313
to move the captain into position.

130
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:52,415
Once there, fingers...
Loving that code name...

131
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:54,183
Will remove the captain's watch

132
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:56,853
and replace it with this replica watch.

133
00:04:56,854 --> 00:04:59,455
Oh, that is a very dead dove.

134
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:00,456
Ooh!

135
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:01,991
All right...

136
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,560
This replica watch.

137
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,795
Jake, if he's been arrested before,

138
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:06,896
how do you know he's any good?

139
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,698
Perhaps this will answer your question.

140
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:09,732
Fingers!

141
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:13,069
Whoa.

142
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:15,004
That's our stuff.

143
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,572
My croissant.

144
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:18,408
But where's the smoked Turkey?

145
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:19,609
Check your breast pocket?

146
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:21,544
Come on!

147
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,981
Let's win this bet!

148
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,851
Salutations, Captain.

149
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:31,955
I was wondering perchance

150
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:34,257
if you would like to attend
the opera with me this Eve.

151
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:35,425
I'll pass,

152
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,560
choosing instead
to stay in my locked office

153
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:41,264
with my watch still safely on my wrist.

154
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:43,099
I had a feeling you might say that.

155
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:46,836
Thusfore, I have decided
to bring the opera to you.

156
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,005
Hitchcock, Scully!

157
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,344
♪ Oooo fortuna ♪

158
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,648
Now, hammer, it's time.

159
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,284
It's hammer time.
I love life.

160
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,560
You're up, dagger.

161
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:06,589
No need for the somersaults.

162
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,458
Disagree.

163
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,427
Hall monitor, now!

164
00:06:14,465 --> 00:06:17,066
Okay, Boyle, and only because
you insisted I say this,

165
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:18,268
it's time to drop a deuce.

166
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,674
And now, the Jake and bake.

167
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:32,215
Whoa, come on, Amy!
Not cool!

168
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:33,316
That's a guy!

169
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,218
Peralta, that's enough!

170
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,623
Sir, sir.

171
00:06:40,658 --> 00:06:41,891
I'm so sorry.

172
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:43,960
I just wanted somebody
to check my son's candy.

173
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:46,863
Please, let me help you up.

174
00:06:46,897 --> 00:06:48,665
On behalf of the nine-nine,
I apologize.

175
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,000
Fingers has grabbed the package.

176
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,269
I didn't mean for that
to sound so dirty.

177
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:56,105
I'll have someone check your
son's bag of candy immediately.

178
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,642
Clark.

179
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:00,810
Thank you, sir.

180
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:04,380
If you need anything,
please, contact me.

181
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,115
I'll do that.
Thank you.

182
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:07,150
The replica is on the wrist.

183
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:09,219
Game over.

184
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,687
I know all this was done
in the spirit of a friendly bet,

185
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,222
but this all went too far.

186
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,757
Am I understood?

187
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,159
- Peralta!
- Yes, sir.

188
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:18,461
Completely understood, sir.
I'm sorry.

189
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:23,533
But not as sorry as you're
going to be at midnight,

190
00:07:23,534 --> 00:07:27,804
when you realize
you've lost everything.

191
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,008
Hello there, Hank.

192
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,910
I believe a tall,
nimble-fingered man

193
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,312
named McCreary left a package for me.

194
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,548
- Yeah, it's here. Give me a sec.
- Thanks.

195
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:40,917
Ooh, I'm gonna make a movie
of you receiving the watch.

196
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,385
Here.

197
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:44,420
Let me pinch your lips
and make fulsome.

198
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:45,788
Don't touch my face.

199
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:47,457
Fine, but if you have
dull lips, that's on you.

200
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:49,158
This is Charles Boyle
for Jake Action News.

201
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:50,326
Thank you.

202
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:51,327
Okay, open the box.

203
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:53,796
Here we go!

204
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:56,132
That's weird, it's just a note.

205
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,534
"Thanks for the watch"?

206
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,135
Oh, no!

207
00:07:59,136 --> 00:08:01,204
McCreary stole the captain's watch!

208
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:03,473
Breaking news, there's been
a terrible development.

209
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:05,642
Not now, Charles.

210
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:08,678
Good call.
Media blackout.

211
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,123
We're okay.
It's not over yet.

212
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:14,924
I still have two hours to find fingers

213
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,092
and get Holt's watch back.

214
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:17,360
But how?
He could be anywhere.

215
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,095
He could be in Canada by now.

216
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,430
There are so many forests up there.

217
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:23,166
That country is one giant hiding place.

218
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,801
Boyle, I kinda need you to be
positive right now, okay?

219
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:26,536
Yes, sorry.
Damn my mouth.

220
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:28,104
All right, let's look up
McCreary's arrest records,

221
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:30,774
past addresses, known associates.

222
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:32,208
Peralta.

223
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:34,244
Run, deuce, run.

224
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,312
If you'll excuse me, sir, I have to...

225
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:38,481
Make urines in de toilet.

226
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:40,706
Yeah, that's how people say words.

227
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:41,951
I'd like to ask a favor.

228
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:43,586
Can we please press pause
on this bet for ten minutes?

229
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:44,788
Sure, or we could press
fast-forward,

230
00:08:44,822 --> 00:08:46,689
and I could watch you
talk like a chipmunk.

231
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,592
Peralta, I'm very disappointed in you.

232
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:51,027
Yes, that would be very funny.

233
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:52,495
How do you ruin everything?

234
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,930
Kevin is bringing dinner for me,

235
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,532
and I don't think he'd
appreciate this bet we made.

236
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:57,634
This watch was given to me
by his father

237
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:58,935
just before he died.

238
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:01,571
Oh!
A death watch, cool.

239
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:02,572
Please, never call it that.

240
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:03,907
Copy that.

241
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:05,108
Oh, you know what?

242
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,443
You can have the ten minutes,
no problem.

243
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,111
Love you, bye.

244
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,280
Boyle, fingers just texted.

245
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:11,648
He said he wants to meet up.

246
00:09:11,682 --> 00:09:13,216
Yes.
Let's get outta here.

247
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,617
Be cool.
Holt's watching.

248
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:16,825
Pretend I just said
something really funny.

249
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,590
- Get outta here.
- We gotta go.

250
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,562
Enjoy the vest and the light.

251
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:30,233
You'll be so safe, it's scary.

252
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,267
Lame.

253
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:33,036
That kid gets it.

254
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:35,071
Thanks for finally joining us, Gina.

255
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,574
We had to stuff 400
of these things without you.

256
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:38,775
Great seeing you guys.

257
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,343
Unfortunately, I cannot stay long.

258
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:42,846
I just came to grab a healthy snack.

259
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,013
Got it.

260
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:45,582
I'm still tending to that urgent matter

261
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,983
I was talking about earlier.

262
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,752
Which is what exactly?

263
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:52,288
Hmm, funny you should ask, you
inquisitive litter ferret.

264
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:54,424
I've been practicing my dance moves.

265
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:56,993
♪ If you wanna be with me ♪

266
00:09:56,994 --> 00:09:58,895
♪ Baby there's a price ♪

267
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,230
My dance troupe, Floorgasm,

268
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:03,733
is performing tonight in
the boooo-ty shake grand prix.

269
00:10:03,768 --> 00:10:06,069
Gina, what the hell?

270
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,338
I defended you, and your urgent matter

271
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,641
was just practicing
for some stupid dance show?

272
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:14,077
Look, I can't help it
if my life is literally

273
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:15,412
a step up movie.

274
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:16,546
Oh, is it?

275
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:18,047
Then I suggest you think of this moment

276
00:10:18,048 --> 00:10:19,783
as the montage where you buckle down

277
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:23,186
and take your job seriously so
your boss doesn't kill you.

278
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,455
Fine, then I suggest you figure out

279
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:27,090
how to turn on all these sprinklers

280
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,793
'cause I'm about to tell a story.

281
00:10:33,397 --> 00:10:36,966
Okay, fingers wants us to meet
him in that alley over there.

282
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,301
What's the playbook, Jakey?

283
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:41,838
Well, he left me that note in
the bar to try and scare me.

284
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,840
But it only made me angry.

285
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:47,177
We go in hard and tough
and take what's rightfully ours.

286
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,045
- I want $300.
- Absolutely, no problem.

287
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,346
Whatever you need.

288
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:52,215
I happen to not have
any money on me though.

289
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:53,416
Charles, do you have any cash?

290
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:57,687
Um, I have $120, and my lucky $2 bill

291
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,422
that I found on
my first day of kindergarten.

292
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:01,458
Okay, so that's $122.

293
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:03,793
- And I want your shoes.
- What? Fine.

294
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:06,196
Here.
Take my shoes.

295
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,630
Can I please have the watch now?

296
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,800
You already have it.
You had it all along.

297
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:10,934
What?
What are you talking about?

298
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:11,969
I put it in the glove
compartment of your car.

299
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,203
Think I'm gonna walk around

300
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:14,405
with a stolen police captain's watch?

301
00:11:14,406 --> 00:11:16,006
I'm not an idiot.

302
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,241
Great.
Well, I would say thank you,

303
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,575
but even for a criminal
your customer service

304
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:19,977
has been abysmal.

305
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:21,478
My pleasure.
Have a good night.

306
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,714
Let's get back to the precinct
and win this bet.

307
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:24,815
Jake!
Jake, your car!

308
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,016
No!
Ow, glass.

309
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:27,017
No!

310
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,424
Ugh, syringe.

311
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:29,787
Jake, you parked in front of a hydrant.

312
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:31,021
Stupid fire department.

313
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:32,890
We gotta think of a way
to catch up with that truck.

314
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:34,591
Oh!
How 'bout this?

315
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:37,360
- Yes.
- Hop in.

316
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:41,030
Go!

317
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,866
We're doing it, Boyle.

318
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,934
We're Tokyo drifting.

319
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:48,737
Gah, I can't see the tow truck anymore.

320
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:51,240
Charles, how come you're
so much slower than a car?

321
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,575
I'm just trying not
to jostle you too much.

322
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,944
You're the champagne of friends.

323
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:56,979
Look, there's a bar up ahead.

324
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,080
Maybe we can get a cab up there.

325
00:11:58,114 --> 00:11:59,348
There's still time to get that watch.

326
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:00,616
All right.

327
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,084
Excuse me!

328
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,518
Excuse me.

329
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,953
Shoeless cop coming through.

330
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:08,323
Oh, God!
Charles!

331
00:12:08,358 --> 00:12:09,391
Jake, where are you?

332
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:11,693
Come on!
Gah!

333
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:13,028
I was gonna wear this jacket

334
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,897
to my cousin's bat mitzvah next week.

335
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:15,931
Hey!
Take it easy!

336
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:17,900
Get off of me!

337
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:19,568
Jake, party bus.
Toot! Toot!

338
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:20,903
Get on board.

339
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:23,138
Good idea, Boyle.
Ugh, get off.

340
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,673
Ahh!
He's got my hand!

341
00:12:24,674 --> 00:12:26,008
Aghhh!

342
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,242
Move!

343
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,478
NYPD.

344
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:32,147
I won't stop the party,
but I do need the bus.

345
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,757
Let's dance, rawr.

346
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,226
All right.
What is happening here?

347
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:47,162
It's Halloween, man!
Lighten up, ha ha!

348
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:49,498
It's Halloween!

349
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:51,600
Halloween!

350
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:54,136
Well, gotta do something for 16 blocks.

351
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:55,604
Halloween!
Halloween!

352
00:12:55,605 --> 00:12:58,140
Halloween!

353
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:01,577
Hey, I've been looking for you.

354
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:02,611
We need to talk.

355
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:04,413
Can we not do this right now, Terry?

356
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:07,015
I'm in the midst of a personal tragedy.

357
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,517
Oh, my God.

358
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:10,352
Is everything okay with your family?

359
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:13,088
Family, what?
No, this is serious.

360
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:16,258
Floorgasm just came by and
danced me out of the group.

361
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,403
It's not fair.

362
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:30,606
I founded the group,
and now they wanna kick me out

363
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:33,909
just because I missed
eight rehearsals in a row?

364
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,613
I never thought I'd say this,
but Floorgasm has a point.

365
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:39,982
You're being super irresponsible.

366
00:13:40,016 --> 00:13:41,350
You have a "baditude."

367
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,818
That's a bad attitude.

368
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,686
I love that.

369
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,055
Look, I didn't want you to know

370
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,857
because it's
so off-brand for me,

371
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,893
but I'm missing rehearsals

372
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:52,694
because I've been going
to college at night.

373
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:55,831
I'm trying to finish my
bachelor's degree or whatever.

374
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:58,233
Really?
That's great, Gina.

375
00:13:58,268 --> 00:13:59,668
I'm so proud of you.

376
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:01,703
And while I generally nail everything,

377
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:04,139
I'm just having trouble
balancing my studies

378
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,607
and my passion for dance.

379
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:07,476
Plus, you're working full-time.

380
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,112
Yeah, that actually doesn't
factor into it whatsoever.

381
00:14:10,113 --> 00:14:11,680
Anyway, it doesn't matter,

382
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:13,715
because I'm never gonna dance again.

383
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:16,785
The world just lost an angel.

384
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:18,153
You know what?

385
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:19,488
I'm gonna dance with you tonight.

386
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:22,157
I'm not gonna let
those losers punish you

387
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:23,725
for doing something good.

388
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:25,627
School is cool.

389
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:27,796
That's why it rhymes.

390
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,465
Terry, you are the best!

391
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:32,101
World, your angel has returned.

392
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:35,337
Oh, God.

393
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:38,607
Thanks for the ride.

394
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:41,110
Tag me in those pics.

395
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:43,545
Ah, hi there.

396
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:44,947
I'm Jake Peralta, NYPD.

397
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:47,049
You guys towed my car,
and I really need it back.

398
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,884
Mm-hmm.

399
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:50,219
Got a badge?

400
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,020
Yeah, I sure do.

401
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,956
What?

402
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:55,390
D'oh, my badge!

403
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:58,193
Those demons on the party bus
must have stolen it.

404
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,595
If you got a license and credit card,

405
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:00,929
just pay to get it out.

406
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:01,997
Oh, great.
Thank you.

407
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:03,098
Finally, something goes right.

408
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:04,666
It's gone horribly wrong!

409
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,102
I don't have my I.D.
or my credit cards,

410
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:08,971
but I really need that car.

411
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:10,506
Please, I'm begging you.

412
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,509
Rules are rules.
I can't do nothing for you.

413
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,576
Don't shut it.

414
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:16,845
Don't shut the window.

415
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,614
You got it.

416
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:20,315
Just gonna give up on this
and head straight home

417
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,084
without trying anything else.

418
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:32,761
Oh, look at the view from up here.

419
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:34,630
I didn't know we lived near water.

420
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:37,566
Ouch.

421
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:39,034
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

422
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:42,271
Perfect.

423
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:45,407
Ah.

424
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:50,913
I can still win this bet.

425
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:53,615
I can still win.

426
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,451
No!

427
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:56,785
No!

428
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:58,887
Noooo!

429
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:00,189
Freeze!
Don't move!

430
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:03,058
Oh, my God.

431
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:06,161
There is a tiny chance
I may not win this bet.

432
00:16:09,037 --> 00:16:11,372
Talk now!

433
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:12,806
You seem upset.

434
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:15,042
Well, here's how the story goes.

435
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:17,645
Remember that little
Halloween bet that we made?

436
00:16:17,646 --> 00:16:18,846
You probably don't even remember,

437
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,047
it was so early this morning.

438
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:23,083
Anywhoozle, it turns out
the criminal I hired

439
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,885
to lift your watch was not trustworthy,

440
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:27,555
and I ended up contracting
tuberculosis of the foot

441
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:30,157
and subsequently losing
your death watch.

442
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:32,660
But in the end, I like
to think this whole thing

443
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:34,228
is gonna bring us closer together.

444
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:36,130
And isn't that what
it's really all about?

445
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:38,599
Merry Christmas!

446
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,733
What are you saying?

447
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:41,368
My watch is right here.

448
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:43,504
No, I made a switch.
That's a fake.

449
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,239
No.

450
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,974
This one's a fake.

451
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:48,275
What?

452
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,543
No.

453
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:50,744
What?

454
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:51,812
No.

455
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,314
What?

456
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:55,916
No.

457
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,685
You were behind all this?

458
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,621
You played me.

459
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:03,757
Like Frans Bruggen plays the flute.

460
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:04,959
But how?

461
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,660
I've been planning this this theft
for three months.

462
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:11,398
I know, but I've been
planning it for a year.

463
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,567
Last Halloween, after you won the bet,

464
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:16,003
I went back to my office
to do everyone's paperwork,

465
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:17,738
but I did no paperwork.

466
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,740
I started to plot my revenge.

467
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:23,344
I began by creating a word cloud.

468
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:24,845
But how could you possibly have known

469
00:17:24,846 --> 00:17:26,547
I was gonna try and steal your watch?

470
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:28,782
I knew you would try to take
something important to me.

471
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:33,487
During the year, I drew
your attention to my watch.

472
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:36,190
You're eight minutes late.

473
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,125
You're 14 minutes late.

474
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:42,730
You're three minutes early...
In Chicago.

475
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:44,498
You annoyed me into stealing it.

476
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:45,533
Exactly.

477
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:48,035
Now you had a target,
but you needed a plan.

478
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:49,703
Fortunately,
it walked through the door,

479
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,572
handcuffed to Diaz.

480
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:54,141
This scumbag pickpocket
is Dan McCreary.

481
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,477
He can take anything off of anyone.

482
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:58,345
Anything?

483
00:17:58,346 --> 00:17:59,980
Anyone?

484
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,383
The look on your face, priceless.

485
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,119
I put McCreary
into my employ immediately.

486
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,854
Fast-forward to this morning.

487
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:08,489
You commenced your plan.

488
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:10,157
McCreary stole my watch,

489
00:18:10,158 --> 00:18:11,325
and then replaced it with the replica.

490
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:12,660
And while you celebrated,

491
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:15,896
McCreary put my watch
back in my pocket.

492
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:18,132
The watch never left my person.

493
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:22,536
Dun-dun-duh!

494
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:24,738
I can see that you're enjoying this.

495
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,707
Not nearly as much
as I enjoyed phase two.

496
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:27,741
Phase two.

497
00:18:27,742 --> 00:18:29,410
While you met with McCreary,

498
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:32,513
Santiago placed a fire
hydrant in front of your car,

499
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:34,915
which she then towed away.

500
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,785
Next, I had to take Charles
out of the equation.

501
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:39,019
He had a badge and a gun,

502
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,854
and he would do anything to help you.

503
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:44,491
Enter a parade of drunks
that separated the two of you

504
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:47,661
long enough for Terry
to kidnap Charles.

505
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,830
Then two bears
spilled their drinks on you

506
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,265
and stole your wallet.

507
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:55,002
Those bears?
Scully and Hitchcock.

508
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,605
I can't pull my head off!

509
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:59,006
If Terry kidnapped Charles,

510
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,741
how did Charles tell me
to get on the party bus?

511
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:02,943
Eight months ago at a morning briefing,

512
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,679
I told the squad
that a group of thieves

513
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,515
was targeting party busses,

514
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:10,017
so I could record Charles saying...

515
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,353
Jake, party bus!
Toot toot!

516
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:13,454
Get on board!

517
00:19:15,991 --> 00:19:18,125
I knew Boyle would never
knowingly betray me.

518
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,427
With your jacket and shoes gone,
you didn't look like a cop,

519
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,662
but you still had your badge.

520
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:25,032
That is, until you entered
the party bus.

521
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:27,835
Rosa's feline dancing distracted you

522
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,805
as a mysterious partier
stole your badge on...

523
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:33,107
Halloween!

524
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:34,608
It was you in the mask!

525
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,310
You sly son of a bitch!

526
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:37,478
Well done.

527
00:19:37,512 --> 00:19:40,514
But I do have to ask, those
guys at the impound,

528
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:42,449
did they really smash my car?

529
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,651
No, in fact, I had them wash it.

530
00:19:43,652 --> 00:19:45,452
Good one, Captain.

531
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:47,188
You can't "wash a car."

532
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:49,590
So how'd you convince
the whole squad to betray me?

533
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,158
What'd you offer them?

534
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:52,526
I asked them if they wanted
to embarrass you,

535
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:53,694
and they instantly said yes.

536
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,796
I'm not gonna lie,
that turns me on a little bit.

537
00:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,131
Hmm.

538
00:19:57,132 --> 00:20:01,101
So in addition to the five
weeks of free overtime,

539
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:03,070
I believe I'm owed one more thing.

540
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,805
Yes.
Here we go.

541
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:07,041
One second.

542
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,645
Very well.

543
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,481
- Captain Raymond Holt...
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:19,153
You are an amazing
police Captain/genius.

545
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:22,123
But be warned,

546
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:25,192
I started planning next year's
heist just this minute.

547
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:28,195
Good, then you're only
three months behind.

548
00:20:28,196 --> 00:20:30,564
You sick son of a bitch.

549
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:44,078
Hey.
Don't look so sad.

550
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,281
Floorgasm is just a rudderless
dance ship without you.

551
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:48,883
I would have gone
with "flock of dum-dums."

552
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,217
I talked to the captain.

553
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:51,218
We're all gonna pitch in

554
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,520
and help you manage your time

555
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:55,089
so you can pursue dance and school.

556
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:57,625
And I'd like to volunteer
my time to tutor you for free.

557
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:58,793
Mm, a hard pass on that.

558
00:20:58,794 --> 00:20:59,960
But I do wanna thank you guys

559
00:20:59,961 --> 00:21:02,363
for being so understanding and nice.

560
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:04,398
Now get your game face on.

561
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:07,034
Sarge, it's time to dance!

562
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:09,236
If you forget your moves,
just rip your cape off

563
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:11,172
and throw me up in the air
like a pizza.

564
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:12,606
Put your hands together

565
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:16,944
for the dance duo,
Mr. and Mrs. Terry Jeffords.

566
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:19,580
I did not agree to that name!
