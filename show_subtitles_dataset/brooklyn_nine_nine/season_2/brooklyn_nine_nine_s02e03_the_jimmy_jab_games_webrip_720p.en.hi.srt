1
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:04,314
Ugh, motorcade duty.

2
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:05,682
So boring.

3
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:07,384
I honestly would rather sit around

4
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:09,452
and listen to you talk about
the right way to make paella.

5
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:11,388
There's more than one
right way to make paella, Jake.

6
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:12,989
There are ten right ways.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,858
You got classic Valencian, modern...

8
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,493
No, wait, stop.
I changed my mind.

9
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:18,995
I've made a horrible mistake.

10
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,097
Hey, Rosa, just who I was looking for.

11
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:22,999
Quick question, can I have your
friend Katie's phone number?

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,334
I want to ask her out.

13
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:26,236
No, I don't mix
personal and professional.

14
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:28,171
You're never getting her number.

15
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:30,440
Never like, "we're never gonna
have a black President" never?

16
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:31,508
'Cause that happened.

17
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:32,843
A real never.

18
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:34,678
Like if you ever ask me
about this again,

19
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,514
you're never gonna be able
to eat without a straw.

20
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:40,083
Yeah, okay, well... you

21
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:42,219
are on the wrong side
of history, my friend.

22
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,087
Katie, huh?

23
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,356
Wow, I can't believe you're
not still pining for Amy.

24
00:00:46,357 --> 00:00:48,692
I mean, I pine for years.

25
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:51,561
I still think about Mia, the
nurse that helped my nana pass.

26
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:52,863
Yes, I know.

27
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:54,064
You've told me, like, a hundred times

28
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:55,465
about the time your nana collapsed

29
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:57,067
and accidentally
pulled Mia's pants down.

30
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,935
Best day of my life.

31
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,450
I don't have feelings for Amy anymore.

32
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:02,405
So time for me to get out there

33
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:03,673
and spread my w...

34
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,875
Legs.

35
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:06,676
Get out there and spread my legs?

36
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,178
Well, e-either way.

37
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:10,858
No, not either way.
Only wings.

39
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:32,602
Listen up.

40
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,171
There's been an issue
with the motorcade.

41
00:01:34,172 --> 00:01:35,906
The Serbian President
is delayed in Washington,

42
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:37,073
and we can't start
locking down intersections

43
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:38,608
until he takes off.

44
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:39,976
Apparently he's on an important call

45
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,912
with the Albanian President.

46
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:44,948
Is that Bujar Nishani
or is it still Bamir Topi?

47
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:46,750
Oh, Ames, let me check.

48
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:49,753
Hmm, it just says no one likes you.

49
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:51,254
There's a three-hour delay,
minimum.

50
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:53,256
Captain Holt and I will have
to leave for a meeting

51
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:54,658
at 1 Police Plaza.

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,426
You should all stay prepped and ready.

53
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,295
Dismissed.

54
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:01,565
Guys.
Guys, guys, guys.

55
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,600
Three-hour delay
with no Holt or Terry?

56
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,968
Do you have any idea what this means?

57
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:06,470
- Makeovers.
- No, Charles.

58
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:08,038
The Jimmy Jab games!

59
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,272
Yeah!

60
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:12,109
The first Jimmy Jabs were held in 2008,

61
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,910
when the King of Iraq...

62
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:15,946
President, Iran.
Armen Jimmy Jab.

63
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:17,981
Ahmadinejad.
Came to New York,

64
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:19,449
and were on call
for nine glorious hours

65
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,817
in case there were protests.

66
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:24,187
On that day, a young
genius named Jake Peralta

67
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:25,956
used the last piece of his bagel

68
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,291
to create the first Jimmy Jab event.

69
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:30,327
The monster mouth bagel toss.

70
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:34,631
Oh.

71
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:35,966
And the rest was history.

72
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:37,167
As soon as Holt and Terry leave,

73
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:42,539
we will commence with Jimmy
Jab seven, circus of fools.

74
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,540
Jimmy Jabs...

75
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,475
Jimmy Jabs.

76
00:02:45,476 --> 00:02:48,245
Jimmy Jabs.
Jimmy Jabs.

77
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:50,347
Jimmy Jabs!
Jimmy Jabs!

78
00:02:50,348 --> 00:02:51,648
Jimmy Jabs!

79
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,884
Seems like we're ready for our meeting

80
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:55,218
with deputy chief Wuntch.

81
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,520
Is that how you plan on sitting?

82
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:59,189
Leaning back like
a matinee-goer?

83
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,691
Madeline will eat you alive.

84
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,026
That's no better.

85
00:03:03,027 --> 00:03:04,828
Hands folded on your lap
like a pervert.

86
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:06,997
Sir, what are you so nervous about?

87
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:08,432
There's a new drug in the precinct,

88
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,834
and we need updated
narcotics field kits.

89
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:12,669
All we're asking for is $1,200.

90
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,171
How could she say no to that?

91
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,605
Sergeant, as long as I'm asking for it,

92
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:18,341
Madeline Wuntch can say no to anything.

93
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,178
Ugh, may I?

94
00:03:21,179 --> 00:03:22,579
Those are my tissues, Raymond.

95
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,914
If you were planning on sneezing,

96
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,416
you should have brought your own.

97
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,618
Sir, she's a deputy chief.

98
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:31,188
I'm sure she wants
what's best for the community.

99
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:32,689
She doesn't care about the community.

100
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,459
She only cares about defeating me.

101
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,027
This is war, sergeant.

102
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,196
The war on Wuntch.

103
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:41,698
Oh, good.
You've named it.

104
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,034
So Jimmy Jabs, huh?

105
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:45,936
What do you say we make it
interesting this year?

106
00:03:45,937 --> 00:03:47,938
Aha! We could play
for Katie's number.

107
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,373
No.

108
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:51,208
Is this why you wanted
to do Jimmy Jabs?

109
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,076
No. Yes.
Why? What gave it away?

110
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,745
You said, "aha"
and snapped your fingers.

111
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:56,380
Ah.

112
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,881
Oh, you wanna go out
with Rosa's friend Katie?

113
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:59,416
That's great.
She's cool.

114
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:00,884
I know, but Rosa has this dumb rule

115
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,053
about not mixing work
with personal stuff.

116
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:04,554
That's actually not a bad policy.

117
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,556
I once gave my aunt
a jaywalking ticket,

118
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:09,292
and things really
deteriorated between us.

119
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,761
Hmm.
But Jake and Katie

120
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:13,163
would be awesome together.
I know, right?

121
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:14,464
She's single.
I'm single.

122
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:16,466
She's pretty.
I'm pretty.

123
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:17,968
So it's settled.

124
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,670
If I win the Jimmy Jabs,
you give me her number.

125
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:21,405
And if I lose, you don't
have to give it to me.

126
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,572
I already don't have to give it to you.

127
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:24,174
All right, I'll give you $200,

128
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:25,475
and I'll never ask you
for another phone number again.

129
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:27,177
Done.

130
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,413
Hello, Gina.

131
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:31,415
It's daylight, Boyle.
Why are we talking?

132
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,849
This is an emergency.

133
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,751
I've been filming my fitness routine

134
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,853
with the precinct camera
to help improve my form.

135
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:38,789
That's where I got these tree trunks.

136
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,291
But I realized that I left the tape

137
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:43,126
in the camera, and now it's gone.

138
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:44,127
Who cares?

139
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:46,096
Who cares?
Who cares?

140
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:48,665
You probably will.

141
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,839
Oh, Boyle, I love that you're trying

142
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,708
to step up your sex game.

143
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,277
But strength is not your issue.

144
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:01,945
Stop humming.

145
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,280
And it does not turn me on

146
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,682
when you bend over and back up into me.

147
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:07,451
Did someone check out
the camera this morning?

148
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:08,652
Yes, Hitchcock.

149
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:11,021
And if he sees it,
he will tell everyone.

150
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:12,522
You need to get that damn tape.

151
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:15,058
- Okay.
- We're off.

152
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,360
You'll get word when
the Serbian President

153
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,495
- is wheels-up.
- You got it, sarge.

154
00:05:18,496 --> 00:05:19,830
We'll just be here till you get back.

155
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:22,132
Calmly and respectfully prepping.

156
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,500
All right, they're gone!

157
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,168
Ceremonial bagel.

158
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,503
Flask.

159
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,507
Flame.

165
00:05:51,715 --> 00:05:54,383
Welcome to the Jimmy Jabs.

166
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:55,918
We play for pride.

167
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:58,387
We play for the phone numbers
of Rosa's friends.

168
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:02,391
But most importantly, we
play to watch Amy lose.

169
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:04,327
- Nope. This is my year.
- It's my year too.

170
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:05,494
Please don't align yourself with me.

171
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:06,963
Why not?

172
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:08,764
Neither of you have ever
come close to winning.

173
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:13,102
You're exactly the same,
just a couple of Santiagos.

174
00:06:14,404 --> 00:06:18,074
But the real prize is
the Winchester 3000,

175
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,809
the only chair in the precinct

176
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,245
with minimal staining,
good lumbar support,

177
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:24,580
and no broken rolly-wheels.

178
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:25,615
Over to you, Gina.

179
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:26,916
Thank you, Jake.

180
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,718
Okay, guys, as usual,

181
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:31,387
the loser of each event
is eliminated from the games.

182
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:35,157
The winner gets a bonus
in the final round.

183
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:38,194
Our first event is...

184
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:39,595
"The mouthathon."

185
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:43,099
In front of you is month-old
Chinese food from the fridge.

186
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,935
Go ahead and eat as much
as you can stomach.

187
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:49,939
On your mark, get set, Wahlberg!

188
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,277
Ugh!

189
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,945
I can't do this to my mouth.

190
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:57,680
She's the love of my life.

191
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,248
Charles is eliminated.

192
00:06:59,283 --> 00:07:01,284
Ugh, I think this ball of soup is off.

193
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:02,285
I'm out!

194
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:03,486
I can do this.

195
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:05,188
I wanna win so bad.

196
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:07,056
Oh, great. Here, quick.
Let me take a picture.

197
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:08,791
Oh, that's so cute.

198
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,025
You've got a little bit of mold
on the tip of your nose.

199
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:14,864
I tried.
I tried, but he's unbeatable.

200
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,836
You guys know this is free, right?

201
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,706
Hello, Deputy Chief Wuntch.

202
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,041
You've aged.

203
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:27,143
Stay seated.
We can do this out here,

204
00:07:27,144 --> 00:07:30,046
since you've already made
yourselves comfortable.

205
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,914
Sergeant Jeffords,
why don't you just lie down?

206
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:35,051
I can't sit any straighter than this.

207
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:38,154
We're here about a new and
very potent form of ecstasy,

208
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:39,822
which has surfaced in our precinct.

209
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:42,491
Street name, giggle pig.

210
00:07:42,492 --> 00:07:45,428
Hmm, an embarrassing blight
growing right under your nose.

211
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:48,030
Not unlike that moustache
you had when we first met.

212
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:51,234
That moustache
was era-appropriate.

213
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:54,170
The precinct just needs
updated field kits

214
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,338
to help us combat the problem.

215
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:56,839
This paperwork is a mess.

216
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,041
A semicolon that should
clearly be a full colon?

217
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,177
Was this prepared
by a recent immigrant?

218
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:02,912
It's just one typo.

219
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:04,947
It's gibberish.

220
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:06,516
Request denied.

221
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,788
Wow.
You were right.

222
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:14,524
All it took was one mistake.

223
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:16,359
You think that semicolon was a mistake?

224
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,860
No, it was a juicy piece of bait,

225
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:21,731
and she unhinged her jaw
and swallowed it whole.

226
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:24,367
So you wanted her to say no to us?

227
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:27,069
Rejecting a valid request
for such a petty reason,

228
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,705
that's all the ammunition
I need to go over her head.

229
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,041
I secretly scheduled us
a one-on-one

230
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:35,077
with Madeline's boss, chief Fisker.

231
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:37,647
You wanna hear the funniest thing ever?

232
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:42,018
I also split and infinitive,
and she didn't notice.

233
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:46,322
Hey, buddy.

234
00:08:46,323 --> 00:08:48,858
Did you check out the department
video camera by any chance?

235
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:50,159
Yeah, I was gonna take it home

236
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,494
and videotape the top of my head.

237
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:53,529
I think I might be thinning up there.

238
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:54,897
Cool, cool.

239
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:58,267
So I accidentally left a tape
in there, and I want it back.

240
00:08:58,268 --> 00:08:59,769
Why?
What's on it?

241
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:01,070
Nothing.

242
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:03,306
I just really need it for no reason.

243
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,475
Well, if you want that tape back,

244
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:07,376
I gotta get something in return.

245
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,145
Are you blackmailing me?

246
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,746
I don't have any money, Hitchcock.

247
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:13,349
I'm still paying
my uncle's funeral bills.

248
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,451
I rear-ended the hearse.
It was a mess.

249
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,487
There's one thing I want,
and it's not that big.

250
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:20,256
I just want you to make me cool
in everyone's eyes.

251
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,091
Not that big?

252
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:25,695
The Jimmy Jabs has claimed
its first victims.

253
00:09:25,696 --> 00:09:29,031
Boyle, you made no impact.

254
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:32,835
Also, Detective Scully has
withdrawn due to food poisoning,

255
00:09:32,836 --> 00:09:34,971
which I think we all saw coming.

256
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:38,307
All right, the second event
is "bulky bulky run run,"

257
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,443
the bomb suit foot race.

258
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,378
Sure hope I don't sprain
my arm during the face,

259
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,280
'cause I'm gonna be
opening up a lot of doors

260
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,681
for Katie on our date.

261
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:48,251
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a gentleman.

262
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:49,986
What are you doing, Jake?

263
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:52,655
Trash talking you, while
simultaneously proving

264
00:09:52,656 --> 00:09:54,123
that I will be
respectful of your friend.

265
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:55,425
It's a tough line to walk.

266
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,294
Gotta loosen up
my flower-buying fingers.

267
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:00,630
I'm gonna go nuts on the daisies.

268
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:03,733
On your mark...

269
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:04,801
Get set...

270
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:05,802
Ruffalo!

271
00:10:08,872 --> 00:10:10,139
Go!

272
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:14,577
I'm doing it, Charles!

273
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,412
I look cool!

274
00:10:16,413 --> 00:10:17,580
Whaaow!

275
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:23,152
The next event will be
"keep your cover."

276
00:10:23,153 --> 00:10:25,888
Contestants must craft
an undercover persona

277
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:28,391
and talk to as many
police officers as you can

278
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:30,960
before being recognized.

279
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:32,728
Pregnant.
Nice.

280
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:34,564
Means ya had sex.

281
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:37,500
Damn right, I did.
And I forgot my birth control.

282
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,368
- Yeah!
- Yah!

283
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:41,738
I think the belly will draw
attention away from my face.

284
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,239
- Smart. Like one big boob.
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:46,242
Jake will go first,
then Amy, then Rosa.

286
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:49,178
On your mark, get set, Paul Gosselaar!

287
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:52,315
Please let me have the tape.

288
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:53,549
No dice.

289
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,551
I don't know how to make you cool.

290
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:57,553
I'm not even that cool myself.

291
00:10:57,554 --> 00:11:00,010
- I mean, sure, I have a pizza stone.
- You have cool friends.

292
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:01,391
Like Jake.

293
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:03,126
I just wanna be part of a conversation

294
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:06,095
where Jake uses my name
and nobody insults me.

295
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,864
Damn it!
You ask too much.

296
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,165
Ahh.

297
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,100
I blew it.

298
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,023
I only got through two people.

299
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:16,039
He's kicking so much.
You wanna feel?

300
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,207
No! That's a bad idea!

301
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,744
Oh, my baby!
It's on the side!

302
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:23,913
Oof. I got to six.

303
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:25,948
Dumb baby!

304
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:28,284
People are right...
They ruin everything!

305
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:30,420
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I wanna try.

306
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,721
Let me be pregnant.

307
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:33,056
Whoop!

308
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:34,290
- Adorable.
- Right?

309
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:36,059
I can't believe I lost again!

310
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,194
I was so psyched up for this.
What happened?

311
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:41,864
Well... maybe being
so psyched up is what happened.

312
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:44,000
Like every time
we're doing police work,

313
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:45,902
you're always super-smart
and you stay calm

314
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:47,336
and take your time,

315
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:49,105
but every time we do
dumb games like this,

316
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:51,441
you get all frantic
and act like a crazy idiot.

317
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:54,711
My advice... next time
don't act like a crazy idiot.

318
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:57,480
Thanks. That's surprisingly
insightful.

319
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:59,682
Yeah, well, motherhood...

320
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:01,551
Really opens a man's eyes.

321
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:03,686
I finally feel as if
I'm part of something

322
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:05,922
- bigger than myself.
- All right.

323
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:06,923
- Too much?
- Yeah.

324
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:09,092
Peralta.
What the hell?

325
00:12:09,126 --> 00:12:11,327
Where were you?
I got eliminated.

326
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:13,429
'Scuse me, officer.

327
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,498
- Yes, sweetheart.
- Sweetheart?

328
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:16,866
Seriously, Hank?
Is that how you

329
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,301
talk to women who come in here?

330
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:19,673
Jimmy Jabs.

331
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:21,504
I didn't even make it past one person.

332
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:23,506
You're out?
I'm in the finals?

333
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,108
And all I have to do
to get Katie's number

334
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:26,743
is beat Amy?
Oh, that's nothing.

335
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:29,779
Hey! Don't you dare
touch Amy Junior.

336
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,180
That's right.

337
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,082
It's your baby!

338
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,184
Are you sayin' I knocked you up?

339
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,186
- You sure did!
- Jake.

340
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:39,355
- Hmm?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

341
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,457
Yeah, sure thing.
Hold that.

342
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,658
- Sure.
- All right, Jake...

343
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:44,127
You wanna call off the bet?

344
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:45,728
Seriously?
You're gonna back out now

345
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:46,996
just 'cause you're losing?

346
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:50,033
What is this, a riverboat casino
on the river of no rules?

347
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,635
No. I'm giving you
a chance to call off the bet

348
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:54,704
because it's clear you don't
actually want Katie's number

349
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:56,372
because you're still into Amy.

350
00:12:56,407 --> 00:12:59,008
What? That's crazy.
I just spent the whole day

351
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,476
fighting for another girl's number.

352
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:02,445
Tsk. You spent the whole day
flirting with Amy.

353
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,514
Yeah, we're joking around
because we're friends

354
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:05,982
now that I've moved on.

355
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:07,483
Then prove it.

356
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:10,320
Beat Amy and don't flirt
with her at all.

357
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,922
Fine. Easy.
But you better tell Katie

358
00:13:12,923 --> 00:13:14,724
to clear her schedule out
Thursday for a date,

359
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,559
'cause I am working nights until then,

360
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,194
and the following weekend,
I am out of town.

361
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:20,065
Let's do this!

362
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:24,286
Hey, Jake.
Question for ya.

363
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,222
When I beat you, which
victory dance should I do?

364
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,392
This one?

365
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,262
Or this one?

366
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:34,997
Oh, wow, okay.

367
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,702
Both are examples of victory dances.

368
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,070
No comeback?

369
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,172
After I burned you with those moves?

370
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,375
You must be pretty nervous.

371
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,876
Yep.

372
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,478
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Charles.

373
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:53,081
Who's this with me?

374
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,484
Hitchcock?

375
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,789
Well, we should go now.

376
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,758
Wow!

377
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,426
What a high!

378
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,395
Do you guys feel this way all the time?

379
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,430
I did what you wanted.
Give me the tape.

380
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,732
Oh, no, we're not done yet.

381
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,603
Next, I want you to tell
everyone you think I'm handsome.

382
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,305
Make it seem natural.

383
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,707
You are a monster!

384
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,144
So they're calling
the drug "giggle pig"?

385
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,846
Chief fisker.

386
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,981
Sergeant Jeffords.
Raymond.

387
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,349
Deputy Chief Wuntch.

388
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,684
I didn't realize you'd be attending.

389
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,152
I can tell.

390
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:32,187
You have more of a fly-catching
gape than usual.

391
00:14:32,222 --> 00:14:34,289
I've examined his proposal.

392
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:36,525
There's no proof that giggle
pig is a serious problem.

393
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,960
So we're just supposed to wait

394
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,361
until it turns into an epidemic?

395
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,630
You're like The League of Nations in '36...

396
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,633
Just hoping the Abyssinian
crisis resolves itself.

397
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:48,003
That's the lesson you draw
from the fall of Addis Ababa?

398
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,105
Raymond, you sound so naive.

399
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,042
And you sound just like
Victor Emmanuel III.

400
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,745
I have no idea who's winning.

401
00:14:56,746 --> 00:14:58,013
I am.

402
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,414
Captain Holt, how serious a threat

403
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,383
do you really think giggle pig poses?

404
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,318
- Very serious.
- Or it could be nothing.

405
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:04,987
Or it could be the new crack.

406
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,355
The new crack?

407
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:08,223
And you only need $1,200 to fight it?

408
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:10,058
Well, in an ideal situation,

409
00:15:10,093 --> 00:15:12,594
we would attack the problem
with a lot more fire power,

410
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:14,496
perhaps even a task force.

411
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:17,399
That makes sense.
Let's make it happen.

412
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,700
That was amazing!

413
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:20,502
We got a task force!

414
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,872
More importantly, Wuntch got served.

415
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:25,107
Oh, my God.

416
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:27,676
Wuntch sounds like lunch.

417
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,012
Now, this opens up
so many new avenues...

418
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,180
You got your task force.

419
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,814
I'm surprised.

420
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,283
That's funny, after 20 years,
I'd think you'd be

421
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:36,386
used to me
slam-dunking in your face.

422
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,087
I'm surprised you didn't see
what was going on in there.

423
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:41,256
I got you riled up,
you oversold giggle pig,

424
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:43,358
and now you're running
an expensive task force

425
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,270
in a time of budget cuts.

426
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:47,663
You better make
some big arrests... and quick,

427
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,567
or you'll be the poster boy
for departmental waste.

428
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:53,869
Slam dunk... returned.

429
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,971
Not if we make those arrests.

430
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,073
3-point dunk.

431
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:00,209
You guys really don't know
enough about basketball

432
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,246
to be doing this.

433
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:04,246
Join hands, one and all,

434
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,881
for we have reached the final event

435
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,015
of the Jimmy Jabs...

436
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,884
the obstacle course.

437
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:10,853
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.

438
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,656
Yes. We all need luck.

439
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,558
Thank you for offering me some.

440
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:18,927
On your mark, get Seth...

441
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:20,929
- Rogen!
- Go, Amy!

442
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,166
Contestants must make it past
the barricade hurdles

443
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,503
then use a bean bag gun to get a snack.

444
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:28,904
Ah!

445
00:16:28,938 --> 00:16:31,907
You will eat the snack in its entirety.

446
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,609
- Ah!
- Mmm!

447
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,881
Come on...
Close, close, close, close!

448
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,049
- Ah!
- Ugh!

449
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,718
Next, head down to the first floor

450
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,654
where you will locate
a pamphlet about bullying.

451
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:50,459
Then print out a picture of
me using a laptop from 1982

452
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,762
whoever grabs their printout
first is the winner!

453
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,097
Aah!

454
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,632
Surprise twist!

455
00:16:58,635 --> 00:17:01,136
Aah!

456
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,704
What are you doing, Santiago?

457
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,206
Go!

458
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,809
Aah! You're burning my skin!

459
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,045
No broken rolly wheels!

460
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:14,316
I did it!
I took my time,

461
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:16,952
I wasn't a crazy idiot, and I won!

462
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,021
I finally ♪ wo-on ♪

463
00:17:19,022 --> 00:17:20,789
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

464
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,624
Yes! Ye...

465
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:26,829
What's going on here?

466
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:30,833
Someone answer him now!

467
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,401
Santiago!

468
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,536
Peralta!

469
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:37,539
- Boyle?
- Hitchcock is very handsome.

470
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,874
Why, thank you, Boyle.

471
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,876
No one has anything to say?

472
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:44,146
Captain, what you just saw
was the Jimmy Jab games.

473
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,415
It's a bunch of dumb contests
we play to kill the time.

474
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,883
Nobody even cares who wins.

475
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:49,351
I won!

476
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:50,919
It's stupid, but we like it.

477
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,489
Clean this up. Now.

478
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,360
Boyle, I'm ready to take
this to the next stage.

479
00:17:58,361 --> 00:18:00,329
You're gonna pierce
my ear... wait.

480
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,997
What are you doing in my locker?

481
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,366
I can't do this.
I can't make you look cool.

482
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:07,769
Because you're afraid that Jake
and I are gonna cut you out.

483
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,072
- Well, you're not wrong.
- I'm gonna find that tape.

484
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:11,340
You think I'd just leave

485
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,008
something that valuable lying around?

486
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,410
- I got it on me.
- Oh!

487
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,546
Gimme that tape!

488
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:19,414
Ah! Gimme that tape!

489
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:22,217
Jake! Help me!

490
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,019
- Ugh! Ah!
- Uhh! Ugh!

491
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,954
The Serbian President's plane
is wheels up.

492
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:28,056
Report to your motorcade
positions immediately.

493
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,958
Let's go!

494
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,860
Hey, you gave it a good try.

495
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,895
Sorry you lost.

496
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:36,198
No. It's for the best.

497
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,699
I let Amy win.

498
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,635
Close, close, close, close!

499
00:18:39,636 --> 00:18:41,069
- Ah!
- Oh!

500
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,972
You're right.
I'm not over her.

501
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:53,028
Boyle, get out.
I need to talk to Jake.

502
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,930
Okay. Bye!

503
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:56,831
I warmed up the seat.

504
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,436
Ugh, he did warm up the seat.

505
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:02,837
It's like a fire pit.

506
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:04,973
Look, if you're here for your $200,

507
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:07,375
can I interest you in a check
that will definitely bounce?

508
00:19:07,376 --> 00:19:08,877
- No. You will pay me in cash.
- Ok.

509
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:12,681
Look, I thought I was over Amy,

510
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:14,382
but clearly I'm not, you know?

511
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:15,717
I'm as frustrated as you are.

512
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,519
I'm not frustrated.

513
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,187
But I am not enjoying this.

514
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:22,524
It is not like you
to get hung up on a girl.

515
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:23,725
I don't know what to do.

516
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,061
You call Katie.
That's what you do.

517
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:28,230
Only way to move on is to move on

518
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,599
whether you think
you're ready to or not.

519
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,968
Gotta get out there, man.

520
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:34,436
All right.

521
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,937
Thank you.

522
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,205
Good luck.

523
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:40,609
Are you okay, sir?

524
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:42,444
I don't want to sound dramatic,

525
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:45,714
but today has been
sub-optimal.

526
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:47,249
That doesn't leave this office.

527
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,084
Muntch beat me.

528
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:51,319
The squad was a disaster.

529
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,555
And in the end, you know
who I'm angriest with?

530
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:55,790
- Yourself?
- No. Muntch.

531
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:58,093
I need this task force to succeed,

532
00:19:58,094 --> 00:19:59,828
and there's not a Detective here

533
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:01,596
who's adult enough to lead it.

534
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:05,267
Peralta and Santiago were
cowards, Diaz was disrespectful,

535
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:09,767
and I just saw Hitchcock and
Boyle fighting like children.

536
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:11,206
Get off...
Get off me!

537
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,807
Hitchcock...
Gimme that tape!

538
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:14,409
You're squeezing my boobs!

539
00:20:14,443 --> 00:20:17,746
Sir, I know you think
Rosa disrespected you,

540
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,315
but I found her inspiring.

541
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:21,549
She did what I should have done...

542
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,285
Stand up and tell you the truth.

543
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,754
And what truth is that?

544
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:27,656
First, everyone else

545
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:30,759
made this Wuntch-lunch
connection instantly.

546
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:33,094
Second, Wuntch didn't beat you.

547
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:35,063
She saddled me with this task force.

548
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:37,265
You think she's consumed
with pettiness?

549
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:38,300
You're no better.

550
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:40,769
Yes, the task force is risky,

551
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,104
but it gives us a chance
to do a lot of good

552
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,739
in the community.

553
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,442
Sir, if you ask me,

554
00:20:47,443 --> 00:20:50,712
you're acting like a real
Victor Emmanuel III.

555
00:20:50,746 --> 00:20:53,582
You used that insult
completely incorrectly.

556
00:20:53,616 --> 00:20:55,150
But...

557
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:58,286
I suppose I have let
Madeline... distract me

558
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:00,021
from our purpose.

559
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:03,325
Which is why I think Rosa
should lead the task force.

560
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:04,655
There's no B.S. with her.

561
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,661
Agreed.

562
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:09,497
Thank you, sergeant.

563
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:13,168
And... I know you were lying
about that Wuntch-lunch thing.

564
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:14,665
That was mine.

565
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:19,507
How was the motorcade?
Any assassinations?

566
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:21,142
No. It was boring.

567
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:23,745
Mmm. Well, thanks for
getting the tape back.

568
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:26,514
Oh!

569
00:21:26,515 --> 00:21:28,883
Oh, guys! Oh!

570
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:30,852
I'll see you tonight at my place?

571
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,988
God, I hate you.
Don't be late.

572
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:38,745
