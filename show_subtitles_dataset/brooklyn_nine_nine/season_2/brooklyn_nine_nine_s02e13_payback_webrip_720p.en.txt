1
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:05,452
Hey, Boyle, I need a recommendation
for a good restaurant.

2
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:08,343
It's Marcus' birthday
and I want to do something...

3
00:00:08,344 --> 00:00:09,477
Nice.

4
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:11,977
Ooh. Do you want like,
classic, romantic?

5
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,468
- Or gastro-sensuous?
- Ugh. Never mind.

6
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:16,816
I know those categories.
You guys are talking dates.

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:17,878
Here's what you do:

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,903
Invite him over,
order some fancy take out,

9
00:00:19,904 --> 00:00:22,080
throw it in a pot,
and act like you cooked it.

10
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:23,788
I got the idea
from yahoo! Answers.

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,224
Dude, I'm not gonna buy a pot.
We're not married.

12
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:28,092
Mm-kay,
you know what time it is?

13
00:00:28,093 --> 00:00:32,196
Because my hoodie does.

14
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:33,331
- Look at that.
- Mm.

15
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,233
I have either two
or four words for you.

16
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:36,401
Drag queen.

17
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:37,386
Dim sum.

18
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:39,304
You're talking about this Friday night?

19
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,705
Everything's gonna be booked.

20
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,340
We're only 72 hours out and we're still

21
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:43,341
in the brainstorming phase?

22
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:44,342
You gotta postpone.

23
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:46,244
You can't postpone a birthday, Amy.

24
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:48,079
But, if you can't get a reservation,

25
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,148
you can always go home
and shampoo his hair.

26
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:52,283
Please stop always recommending that.

27
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:53,618
Well, it's always romantic.

28
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,753
You can go to the top
of the empire state building,

29
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:57,088
that's very romantic.

30
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,856
Hm. Maybe I will.

31
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:00,692
You can pee on the whole city
from up there.

32
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,826
- Come on!
- What? - Come on!

33
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:05,523

34
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,147
Take it.

35
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:24,148
Take it.

36
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,017
Come on!

37
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:27,051
This stupid machine
won't take my dollar.

38
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:29,032
That's half a dollar
taped to a pizza coupon.

39
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:31,398
It's good for a cheesy bread
worth $2.50.

40
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:33,825
You would've made money
on this deal, machine.

41
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,426
Hey, sarge, can I borrow a dollar?

42
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:37,462
No. No more loans.

43
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:39,430
You already owe me way too much.

44
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,232
The bank of Terry is closed.

45
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,867
What, are you sailing away
on a tugboat?

46
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,673
Man, I love tugboats.

47
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:45,737
It's not a tugboat!

48
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,105
I'm locking the vault!

49
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,007
All right, fine, how much
could I possibly owe you?

50
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,209
50, 60 bucks?

51
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:52,681
$2,437.

52
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:53,778
Dollars?

53
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:54,913
Wait, of course dollars,
why was that the part

54
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,114
I was surprised by?

55
00:01:56,115 --> 00:02:00,397
Jake, I would appreciate it
if you paid me back.

56
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:03,187
Well, that's the craziest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

57
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,889
"I would appreciate it
if you paid me back"?

58
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,858
Good.
So you heard it too.

59
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:07,859
I've been in debt to him forever

60
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,260
and he's never cared before.

61
00:02:09,261 --> 00:02:10,562
Something's up.

62
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,829
I'm gonna drop everything
and figure out

63
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,037
why he's acting weird.

64
00:02:13,038 --> 00:02:14,598
Or you could just pay him what you owe.

65
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:16,574
Hilarious, Rosa.

66
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:20,327
Hilarious.

67
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:24,031
Santiago, whenever you can,
please drop of those case files.

68
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:25,366
You got it, partner!
Be right in!

69
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:26,367
"Partner"?

70
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:27,368
What is going on?

71
00:02:27,369 --> 00:02:28,602
Is this a make-a-wish thing?

72
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:29,904
Are you dying?

73
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:31,439
Is it from loneliness?

74
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,641
I found a mistake in one
of the Captain's old cases

75
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:35,443
and he asked me to work it with him.

76
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:37,011
As partners.

77
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:39,113
We're taking our relationship
to the next level.

78
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:41,982
From awkward underling
to awkward colleague.

79
00:02:41,983 --> 00:02:44,452
This is a real ugly duckling story.

80
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,787
We're gonna bounce ideas
off each other,

81
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:49,223
eat street meat while we
stake-out some perp,

82
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:50,791
bond over burned coffee...

83
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:51,792
- Santiago!
- Hm?

84
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:52,793
Now means now!

85
00:02:52,794 --> 00:02:53,794
You got it.

86
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:55,235
See? He can't wait
to work with me.

87
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:57,025
He's clearly pumped.

88
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,402
Hello, Terry.

89
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:00,107
I just thought I'd stop by
and let you know

90
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:01,308
that I'm on my way to the bank.

91
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:02,990
That's right.

92
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:06,243
I'm gonna pay you back
because I know your secret.

93
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:07,781
What are you talking about?

94
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:08,782
I don't have a secret.

95
00:03:08,783 --> 00:03:09,783
Oh, really?

96
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:10,951
Fact the first:

97
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,553
After years of not caring
about my debt,

98
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:14,842
you weirdly want me
to pay you back now.

99
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:17,015
That implies to me
that there is a sudden,

100
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:18,892
unexpected expense.

101
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:21,728
Or I got sick of waiting
for you to do the right thing.

102
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:22,817
Not plausible.

103
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:25,095
You have endless patience
for my shenanigans.

104
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:26,254
Fact the second:

105
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:29,123
You've had dentist appointments
twice in the past two weeks.

106
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:31,125
No one goes to the dentist that much.

107
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:32,978
I haven't been in seven years.

108
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:34,866
You should go to the dentist, Jake.

109
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,465
Probably.
My teeth hurt all the time.

110
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,666
Fact the third:

111
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,435
I'm really liking this
"fact the" thing.

112
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:41,436
I think I'm gonna stick with it.

113
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:42,437
Fact the fourth:

114
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,459
I found this on your desk.

115
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,740
It's a list of names.

116
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,842
Nathaniel Jeffords, Alexa Jeffords...

117
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:49,143
Those are my cousins names.

118
00:03:49,144 --> 00:03:50,244
Lies!

119
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:51,879
There is but one conclusion.

120
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,666
You, Terry Jeffords, are pregnant.

121
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,471
The names are baby names.

122
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,119
The dentist?
An obstetrician.

123
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,322
And the money is for baby things.

124
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:03,395
Like diapers.

125
00:04:03,396 --> 00:04:05,893
What are you talking about, man?

126
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:07,028
Yeah.

127
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,930
- That is crazy.
- Yeah.

128
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,298
Damn it!

129
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:11,299
Does anybody else know?

130
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,035
No, just you, and your wife, and crash.

131
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,303
That's what I think
you should name the baby.

132
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:16,825
Works for a boy or a girl.

133
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:18,439
Listen up, Jake.

134
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,041
We just found out Sharon is pregnant

135
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,443
and it's way too early to tell anyone.

136
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:24,545
This is a secret.

137
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,547
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

138
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:27,548
Do you?

139
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:28,683
Do you understand me?

140
00:04:28,684 --> 00:04:30,630
Oh, this got physical very quickly.

141
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:32,654
This is adult stuff, Jake.

142
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:33,855
Be serious!

143
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,189
Look, I promise
I won't tell anyone, all right?

144
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,224
My lips are sealed.

145
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,425
Good.

146
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,264
Do I even weigh anything to you?

147
00:04:39,265 --> 00:04:40,128
No.

148
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,530
It's like holding a couple of grapes.

149
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:45,008
Okay, partner, let's bang this out.

150
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:46,367
Should we grab a cup of coffee,

151
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:47,769
bounce some theories off each other...

152
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,065
I solved it already.

153
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:50,672
Oh...

154
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:52,774
Then should we grab a cup of coffee,

155
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:53,875
you could tell me
what you found out and...

156
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,076
No, we can do it here.

157
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:57,011
The fires were set by Richard Wilcox,

158
00:04:57,012 --> 00:04:58,680
the firefighter who was
first on the scene

159
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,076
at all three fires.

160
00:05:00,077 --> 00:05:02,383
Okay uh, now we just
have to work backwards,

161
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,685
figure out why...

162
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,029
He was up for a promotion
and wanted to look like a hero.

163
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:06,854
Yup.

164
00:05:06,855 --> 00:05:09,224
But how are we gonna find this bastard?

165
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,258
After all these years,
you know, it could take...

166
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,292
He owns a store.

167
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:12,393
I have the address.

168
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,062
Okay.

169
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,163
I could drive.

170
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:16,832
No, you don't know where we're going.

171
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,234
But if you'd like a cup of coffee,

172
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,436
there's an old bakery
in that neighborhood.

173
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:22,704
The coffee there is terrible

174
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,573
but I would enjoy the nostalgia.

175
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:27,442
I love terrible coffee.

176
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:30,846
Now let's put away Richard
Wilcox, that no-good punk.

177
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,097
He's 86 years old.

178
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:37,652
You don't outgrow punk, sir.

179
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,241
There you are, sergeant.

180
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:41,122
Installment one of TBD.

181
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,924
1,200 bucks, that's everything I have.

182
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,726
You should also note
it's all in singles

183
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:48,208
because it takes so many bills
to fill up a briefcase.

184
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,430
Thanks, Peralta.

185
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:51,933
You know, it's nice
to finally have someone

186
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,601
to share this secret with.

187
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:54,995
I'm pregnant, man!

188
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:56,671
Yeah!
We're pregnant.

189
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,973
"We" because I convinced you
not to get a vasectomy.

190
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:00,909
So if it wasn't for me,
you'd have no penis.

191
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,610
You still don't know
what a vasectomy is.

192
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:03,945
Hey, so listen, I was thinking,

193
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,848
now that I've proven I'm
fiscally responsible,

194
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,677
how you feel about me
being the godfather?

195
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:12,387
How about this?

196
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:14,088
You don't tell anyone
about the pregnancy

197
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:17,350
for four weeks, and I'll think
about you being the godfather.

198
00:06:17,366 --> 00:06:18,259
Yes!

199
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,328
Oh also, I put a list
of baby names in there.

200
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,030
My favorite: Nakatomi.

201
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,331
After the tower in Die Hard.

202
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:24,799
Works for a boy or a girl.

203
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,401
What's going on?

204
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,569
How'd you get all that money?

205
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,270
Pfft, by putting bad guys behind bars.

206
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:31,506
I work for a living, jeez.

207
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,295
I emptied out my checking account.

208
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,976
Wait, you've owed Terry for years,

209
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,279
and now, suddenly, you give him
every penny you have?

210
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,582
- Why?
- Why?

211
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,984
Oh, wait.
Because.

212
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,185
That is not an answer.

213
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:49,357
No. Well, because you guys
got in my head

214
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:50,758
about owing Terry money.

215
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,860
And it convinced me that it's important

216
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,228
to pay back your friends.

217
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:54,462
Well, you owe all of us money.

218
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,197
So does that mean you're gonna
pay all of us back?

219
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:58,099
Yeah, Jake,
or is there something special

220
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,267
about your friendship with Terry?

221
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,268
Nope.

222
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:01,269
Nothing special about Terry.

223
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,570
I'm gonna pay everyone.

224
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,706
Man, I really hoped to say
this to a drug dealer

225
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,242
who killed my whole family, but...

226
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:09,077
It's payback time.

227
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:16,910
All right, but a nice little
dent into my Terry debt.

228
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:17,911
No applause?

229
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:18,979
Seriously?

230
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,547
Okay, I see how this is gonna be.

231
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:21,948
All right, how much do I owe
the rest of you?

232
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,850
$4,009.

233
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,619
What? How is that even possible?

234
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,356
June 3rd, 2008, paid
for your lunch, $8.45.

235
00:07:29,357 --> 00:07:32,258
June 3rd, 2008, bought
you a soda, $1.05.

236
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,595
June 3rd, 2008, lent you $4,000
for an entertainment system.

237
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:36,596
Now there it is.

238
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:37,831
I stopped keeping track after that.

239
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:38,832
Sure.
Sure, okay.

240
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,833
How about the rest of you?

241
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,502
710 dollarinos.

242
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,505
$856.32.

243
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,806
Okay, very specific.

244
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:48,141
I'm sorry you guys,
but I can't pay that.

245
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:49,284
It's too much money.

246
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,311
Why don't you just take back
the money you gave to Terry

247
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:52,345
and split it six ways.

248
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,546
Then at least everyone gets something.

249
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,248
Yeah, but Terry needs the money.

250
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:56,416
For what?

251
00:07:56,432 --> 00:08:00,720
Uh, for butt enhancement surgery.

252
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,888
Smart.

253
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:02,989
That's a real problem area for Terry.

254
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,990
- Yeah.
- What?

255
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:04,991
What?

256
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,693
I am not having butt enhancement
surgery.

257
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,794
Nor do I need it!

258
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:09,396
Okay, so split up the money.

259
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:11,598
No, no, no.
How about this?

260
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,333
I'll work off my debt to each of you.

261
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,568
How's that sound?
I'll do anything you want.

262
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,771
Anything?

263
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:19,506
Am I the only one that was super
creeped out by that?

264
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,708
No, that was definitely creepy.

265
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,777
Yeah, he wants you to do
something real weird.

266
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,780
Hello, partner!

267
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,781
Two coffees.

268
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:29,282
Black for me.
Milk for you.

269
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:30,784
You remembered how I like it!

270
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,118
Yes, with milk.

271
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,153
It's just one ingredient.

272
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:34,154
And you remembered it.

273
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:35,855
Mm.

274
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,962
Anyway, no sign of Wilcox.

275
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:40,098
Maybe we should talk
about deets of the case,

276
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:42,233
plan our next move, grab a little chow.

277
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:43,267
No need.

278
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,670
I brought these.

279
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:48,006
- Nutrition bricks.
- Hm?

280
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:51,770
I have original no-flavor
and whole wheat no-flavor.

281
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,681
Nutrition bricks sound great.

282
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:59,717
Or we could grab a little street meat.

283
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:02,666
Kind of a classic
stakeout food, but whatever.

284
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:04,055
Huh.

285
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:05,390
Meat.

286
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,425
From the street.

287
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:10,128
Sounds like a fun treat.

288
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:14,966
I'm a poet and didn't even know
I was rhyming those words.

289
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:16,601
But it happened anyway.

290
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:18,390
That's a great idea, partner.

291
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:20,204
Let's grab some street meat.

292
00:09:20,205 --> 00:09:22,440
Okay!

293
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,240
How's working your debt off going?

294
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,043
Horrible.

295
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:27,312
Rosa's making clean her motorcycle.

296
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:28,813
Payback's a bitch.

297
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:32,083
Ugh! So many great payback lines
wasted on this.

298
00:09:32,084 --> 00:09:33,351
Damn this bike's muddy.

299
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:34,919
And this isn't even
the worst thing I had to do.

300
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,155
Gina made me call people
and tell them she was dead

301
00:09:37,156 --> 00:09:39,130
to see how they'd react.

302
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:40,579
Is she crying?
Is she crying?

303
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,460
A little.

304
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:46,898
You should be wailing,
you stone cold bitch.

305
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,765
Now call my other grandma.

306
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,767
And then there was Scully.

307
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:53,104
Lower.

308
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:54,105
Lower.

309
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:55,647
- I'm at your butt.
- Lower!

310
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:58,274
Apparently he holds his stress
in the b-cheeks.

311
00:09:58,275 --> 00:09:59,377
Oh, God.

312
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:00,912
I'm so sorry.

313
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:01,913
Well, at least I can help you out.

314
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:03,014
No, no, no, no.

315
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:04,449
That'll only make people suspicious.

316
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,284
Besides, I don't mind
doing all these horrible things,

317
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:07,819
'cause I want to keep your secret safe.

318
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,455
For you, and Sharon, and Miata.

319
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,152
Works for a boy or a girl.

320
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:14,624
Well, well, well, what are you
hens clucking about?

321
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:15,760
What?
Nothing.

322
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:16,960
What do you want, Boyle?

323
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,263
To be paid back.

324
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:19,743
I want you to wash my dogs.

325
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,368
Hm, why would I ask that given
that I know you hate my dogs?

326
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:24,535
They hump everything.

327
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:25,770
They're passionate!

328
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:28,172
But you don't have to wash them at all

329
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,462
if you just tell me
what's going on here.

330
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:31,808
You two have a secret.

331
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:33,344
I can smell it.

332
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:34,345
Jason, not now.

333
00:10:34,346 --> 00:10:35,547
Down.

334
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:37,115
Yuck. We don't have a secret,
all right?

335
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:38,470
Do we have a secret, Terry?

336
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:40,485
If we did, it's a secret from me.

337
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:44,946
Okay then, wash my dogs.

338
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:47,158
And be warned, they just watched
Peabody and Sherman,

339
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,075
so they're extra horny.

340
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,369
Ah!
Jason!

341
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,075
Wait your turn!

342
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,703
I must say, this is quite good.

343
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,444
Is this sauce for your chicken
or my lamb?

344
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:08,261
Hm. I don't know.

345
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:09,414
Should we try it?

346
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,431
Let's risk it.

347
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:13,306
Here we go. Boom.

348
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,468
It's amazing.

349
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:20,458
I don't care for it.

350
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,594
But I tried!

351
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:23,795
And what a story for Kevin!

352
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,164
So who was your partner
back when you caught

353
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:27,265
the Brooklyn broiler?

354
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,900
Martin Ormankupp.

355
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,268
He was a great partner.

356
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:34,706
Smart, loyal, homophobic
but not racist.

357
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,341
In those days, that was pretty good.

358
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:38,446
Hm. How long did you work
the case for?

359
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:41,746
Martin Ormankupp and I
tracked him for eight months.

360
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:45,483
Almost cost him his marriage
to his wife, Heather Ormankupp.

361
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:46,871
Oh, sir, look!

362
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:49,020
Oh, this could be our man.
Let's go.

363
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,658
NYPD.
We're partners.

364
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,094
We'd like to ask you some questions.

365
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:57,629
You're not Richard Wilcox!

366
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,031
That's my grandpa.
He died a couple weeks ago.

367
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:01,856
I'm just here cleaning out his shop.

368
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:03,802
Oh, no.
Something wrong here.

369
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:05,103
Oh, you think this punk
is lying, partner?

370
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:06,304
No.

371
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:08,106
Something's wrong in my intestine.

372
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:10,008
Due to the street meat.

373
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,564
- We must go now.
- Okay.

374
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:16,781
Oh, okay.

375
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:17,782
All right, I'll drive!

376
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:19,818
Oh, my...

377
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,322
Sir, we could find a public bathroom.

378
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:23,783
No! This is a very private
emergency!

379
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,924
Ah!

380
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,962
I'm going to the gym,
then Sharon is gonna take me

381
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:33,184
to a dentist appointment.

382
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,133
Damn sarge, your teeth are messed up.

383
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:36,401
Listen up, everybody.

384
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,603
I just forwarded you an email
about the suspect

385
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:40,271
in those bodega robberies.

386
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:43,695
Check it out.
We're gonna catch this guy.

387
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:45,947
All right, let's see here.

388
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:47,045
Hurricane?

389
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,081
Hurricane Jeffords.

390
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:51,616
Works for a boy or a girl.

391
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:53,299
I know what's going on Jake.

392
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,319
Uh, what?

393
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
About who?

394
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,321
With you and Terry.

395
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:57,555
The money, the private convos.

396
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:58,723
I figured it out.

397
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,425
You stole my idea
to open a bowling alley

398
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,560
and you're gonna do it with Terry.

399
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:03,851
Yup, that's it.

400
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:06,798
Jake. Fingerholes
was our idea.

401
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,982
I do not think it should be
called fingerholes.

402
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,302
You're not calling it fingerholes?

403
00:13:11,303 --> 00:13:12,337
Good luck, pal.

404
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:13,571
Oh, my God!

405
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:14,839
Terry's pregnant?

406
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,974
What? How do you know that?

407
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:17,008
We all know.

408
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:20,064
You hit "reply all" on the
email, grandma Peralta.

409
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,700
Oh, no.

410
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,919
Uh, good.
Great.

411
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,688
The secret is out.

412
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:33,195
I got humped by Jason for nothing.

413
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,790
Okay, yes.
Terry is having another kid.

414
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:38,974
We are pregnant.

415
00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,175
But that's a secret.

416
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:41,710
It's way too soon to tell anyone.

417
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:44,213
I only stumbled across it 'cause
I'm such an amazing Detective.

418
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,381
Who accidentally hit "reply all"
like some idiot

419
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:47,416
on a brunch thread.

420
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,017
Yeah, that.

421
00:13:49,018 --> 00:13:51,286
But, look, Terry can't know
the secret is out.

422
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:52,888
He got the email too, boo.

423
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:54,423
Crap, you're right.

424
00:13:54,424 --> 00:13:56,058
All right, we just have to break
into his email account

425
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,659
and delete the message
while he's down at the gym.

426
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,161
Great, all right, here's the plan.

427
00:13:59,162 --> 00:14:00,162
I'll go down there...

428
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,163
What are you gonna do, Jake?

429
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:02,231
I'm obviously about to say.

430
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:03,532
Okay?
I'll go down there...

431
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:04,900
Sorry, Jake, I thought
it was a call and response.

432
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,026
It's not.
Okay?

433
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:07,236
- I'll go down there...
- Are you mad at me?

434
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,770
Dude!
Okay?

435
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:09,872
Here's the plan.

436
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:10,939
I'll go down to the gym and have Terry

437
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
take me through his workout.

438
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:13,375
You guys get savant from I.T.

439
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:14,676
to help you hack into his account.

440
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:17,279
If anything goes wrong, Scully,
fake a heart attack.

441
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
What are you thinking?

442
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:20,449
Classic angina, or something sexier,

443
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,784
like um, myocardial infarction?

444
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:26,555
Just drop down onto the ground
and wiggle.

445
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:30,792
I'm gonna nail this.

446
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:31,793
You're back so soon.

447
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:32,895
Did you catch your guy?

448
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:34,363
No, he was dead.
So I'll never catch him.

449
00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:38,967
Also, Amy bought us tainted meat
and now I have diarrhea.

450
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:41,031
Oof.

451
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:46,508
Hey, Terry.

452
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:47,976
You get my email?

453
00:14:47,977 --> 00:14:49,695
About how I was coming down here?

454
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,180
No, I haven't checked my phone.

455
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,248
Oh, no need.

456
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:54,816
I just wanted to make sure
you were here, you know?

457
00:14:54,817 --> 00:14:56,422
You know how I like
to have a weight-mate.

458
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:57,252
Really?

459
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:58,820
I have never seen you in the gym.

460
00:14:58,821 --> 00:14:59,821
What?

461
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,256
I basically live here.

462
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:03,158
I'm a regular gym dandy.

463
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,726
Besides, I gotta get into shape

464
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:06,428
for all the godfathering I'm gonna do.

465
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:08,163
I mean, how am I gonna throw
our baby up into the air

466
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:09,231
with these noodle arms?

467
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:10,232
Good point.

468
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,700
So take me through your workout, man.

469
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,068
Rip me up, you know?

470
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,069
Let's rip it out.

471
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,025
Time to rip it down!

472
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:17,673
Those aren't gym terms.

473
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,541
And I don't think
you could handle my workout.

474
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,542
Oh, wow.

475
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:22,211
Sounds like a challenge to me.

476
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,212
Come on.

477
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,380
I got you.

478
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:26,381
- Ready?
- Yup.

479
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:27,608
Oh, my God!
So heavy!

480
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:31,290
This will crack his password,
but it could take an hour.

481
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,489
No way Jake keeps up with Terry
for that long.

482
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,690
Have you seen Terry?

483
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:35,924
Well there's nothing we can do.

484
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,793
Unless you can guess
the sarge's password.

485
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,561
- "Big muscles"?
- Nope.

486
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:41,363
That's your first guess?
"Big muscles"?

487
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:42,998
Try his wife's name, Sharon.

488
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:44,266
- Nope.
- Sharon1.

489
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,501
- Nope.
- Sharon2.

490
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:46,869
- Nope.
- Sharon3.

491
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,036
- Nope.
- This is stupid.

492
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:49,505
Come on!
Push it!

493
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,006
Push it!

494
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:52,741
Five!

495
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:55,094
Ah!
Oh, man.

496
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,066
This is almost too easy.

497
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,247
Are you crying?

498
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,215
No. That's eyeball sweat.

499
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:01,517
All right.
Let's wrap this up.

500
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:03,051
I gotta call Sharon
and get back to work.

501
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:04,052
No, no, no, no.

502
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:07,456
Hey, I thought you said this
was gonna be a challenge, huh?

503
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:09,925
This has been a cakewalk so far.

504
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:11,860
Oh, you want me to make this harder?

505
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:13,095
Yes.

506
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:14,096
That is what I want.

507
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:15,631
More harder exercise.

508
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:17,432
Look, sarge!

509
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,901
I've burnt 200 calories.

510
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:20,135
That's your heart rate.

511
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:21,840
Yeah.
That checks out.

512
00:16:21,841 --> 00:16:25,040
Come on, Jack, ten more minutes.

513
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:27,096
I think we should stop now, Peralta.

514
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:28,377
No, no.
I'm still good.

515
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:29,378
Check this out.

516
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:34,316
Right hook, right hook, uppercut.

517
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:38,086
My arms don't seem to be
responding to my brain anymore.

518
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,121
Nope.

519
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:41,356
Ugh! God,
I hate how hard it is

520
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:43,325
to guess other people's passwords.

521
00:16:43,326 --> 00:16:45,093
Wait!
Everyone, wait!

522
00:16:45,094 --> 00:16:49,898
Try "yogurt."

523
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:50,899
We're in!

524
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,081
Terry loves yogurt.

525
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:55,370
Come on, Jake!
Let's go!

526
00:16:55,371 --> 00:16:57,439
So how much blood do you
usually have in your mouth

527
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
when you do this?

528
00:16:58,441 --> 00:17:02,444
None.

529
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:03,645
Great, I'm done.

530
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:06,749
Great workout, sarge.

531
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:09,485
Ah, Boyle, I need to throw away
this piece of paper

532
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,652
but I can't move my body.

533
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:11,653
On it, Jakey.

534
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,055
It's show time, here we go.

535
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:15,716
I love this, we're like
Batman and Alfred.

536
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,192
You'd rather be Alfred than Robin?

537
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:19,761
He has access to the batcave,
plus, he gets to drive

538
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:22,317
all of Batman's girlfriends home
and dish.

539
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:23,986
Doy.

540
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:26,168
Oh, hey!
How are you Mrs. Sarge?

541
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,531
You look normal.

542
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:30,139
Hi, Jake.
Charles.

543
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,607
Uh, hold on, honey.

544
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:34,329
I gotta check my emails
and then I'll be ready to go.

545
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,288
Okay, all set.

546
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:47,289
All right, have fun.

547
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,290
Yeah.

548
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,324
Sergeant Jeffords.
Sharon.

549
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:50,559
The Captain's back?
When he get back?

550
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,627
Turn me around!

551
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:52,728
I'm not feeling well.

552
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:53,829
I have an appointment at the restroom

553
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,798
but I gather congratulations
are in order.

554
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,632
For what?

555
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,100
Oh, Peralta sent everyone in the office

556
00:17:58,101 --> 00:18:00,135
an email about what to name
your new baby.

557
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:04,039
For what it's worth,
I really like the name Todd.

558
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,058
Terrence, what is he talking about?

559
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:11,180
Yeah, Peralta!
What is he talking about?

560
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:13,107
Hey.

561
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:14,123
Scully! Now!

562
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,720
Oh, no!
He's having a heart attack!

563
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,389
This is a man's life,
you calloused bastards!

564
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:27,172
Terry, I am so sorry.

565
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,455
You should be sorry.

566
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,797
Should I get out of here

567
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:31,432
or should I just fade
into the background

568
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,501
until you need me to wheel you out?

569
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:36,003
I'll fade.
I'll fade.

570
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,572
You promised you wouldn't tell anyone.

571
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:40,174
I know, but I can't help it
if everyone in this precinct

572
00:18:40,175 --> 00:18:41,542
is a brilliant Detective.

573
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:43,478
You emailed them all!

574
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,512
With your email!

575
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:45,880
To their emails!

576
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:48,282
Okay, yes, that was one fact
that may have helped them

577
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:51,085
crack the case,
but Boyle was closing in.

578
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,320
I was actually way off.

579
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:54,856
All my theories
were bowling alley related.

580
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:57,425
Fading, fading again.

581
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:58,526
Look, I know I messed up.

582
00:18:58,527 --> 00:18:59,794
But it was an honest mistake.

583
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:02,063
I promise you, I was taking it
seriously.

584
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:04,169
What was the email
you sent everyone about?

585
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,968
How you should name your kid hurricane.

586
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:08,465
Wheel him out, Charles.

587
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,337
Wait.

588
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,172
Does this mean I can't be
the godfather?

589
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:12,607
I said wheel him out.

590
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:13,908
You can be my godfather, Jake.

591
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:15,595
You're older than me!

592
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,481
Captain?
How are you feeling?

593
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:21,683
Better today.

594
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:24,185
I even managed to eat some
plain toast this morning.

595
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,253
Smart.

596
00:19:25,254 --> 00:19:26,287
Something bland.

597
00:19:26,288 --> 00:19:27,722
That's my favorite breakfast.

598
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:29,190
Right.

599
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:31,959
Sir, I'm sorry.

600
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,195
I wanted to be a great partner.

601
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:35,730
A Martin Ormankupp.

602
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:38,032
But instead, I was the partner
who made you sick.

603
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:41,469
Can I tell you something
about Martin Ormankupp?

604
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,837
On our second day as partners,

605
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:45,340
Martin Ormankupp was kicked
in the crotch by a police horse.

606
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:47,108
Not what I was expecting you to say.

607
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,010
Of all the cases that we worked,
that moment was the one

608
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:50,778
that bonded us the most.

609
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,246
Because that's what we laughed about.

610
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:55,083
After his surgery
and months long rehab.

611
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,584
It was a terrible ordeal
for both Martin

612
00:19:56,585 --> 00:19:58,139
and Heather Ormankupp.

613
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,216
Mm. So you think we can laugh
about me poisoning you?

614
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:04,959
Yes, I do.

615
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,994
Someday.

616
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:08,596
Perhaps over street meat.

617
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:10,865
Sir, did you just laugh?

618
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,033
Uproariously.

619
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:13,534
Oh, my God.

620
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:15,370
It's happening.

621
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,230
Yup.

622
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,573
Here, sarge.

623
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:20,203
It's the rest of the money I owe you.

624
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,542
1,237 bucks.

625
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:23,344
I thought you already drained
your bank account.

626
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:24,746
I sold my car.

627
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:26,334
It's not a big deal.

628
00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:28,867
Oh, my God!
This is such a huge deal!

629
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,987
I can't un-tell your secret.

630
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:34,555
The best I can do is make sure
no one talks about it

631
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:38,335
for the next four weeks
and pay back your money, so.

632
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:39,931
Jake, hold up.

633
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,463
Yeah?

634
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:44,215
I was wondering if you still
wanted to be the godfather.

635
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:46,401
Wait, seriously?

636
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:47,802
Yes!
Of course!

637
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,304
That would be amazing.

638
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:50,638
Thank you.

639
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:51,940
I'm gonna be such a good godfather.

640
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:53,474
You'll see.
I'm gonna be like...

641
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:55,710
"What's the matter with you? Be a man!"

642
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:57,045
You know?

643
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:59,213
You know, obviously I wouldn't
scream that at the baby.

644
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,315
That was a bad quote to choose.

645
00:21:00,316 --> 00:21:01,775
But you get what I'm saying.

646
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,819
Yeah, look, that kid
is gonna have a lot of fun

647
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,071
hanging out with you.

648
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:10,158
But I also know that if anything
happened to me and Sharon,

649
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,261
you're responsible enough
to raise the little guy.

650
00:21:13,262 --> 00:21:16,531
Wait, that's what a godfather does?

651
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:18,366
I mean, I knew that.

652
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,401
I can handle it!

653
00:21:20,402 --> 00:21:21,402
Just real quick, what's a good book

654
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:23,004
on parenting that you could recommend.

655
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:25,106
Or better yet, what's a good
movie on parenting?

656
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:26,207
Terry?

657
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,410
Seriously, I have no idea what to do!

658
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:30,545
Oh, wait!

659
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:32,113
