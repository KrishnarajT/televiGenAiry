1
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:06,289
Whatcha got there?

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,891
A candle, perfume.
Bra.

3
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:10,927
Someone's dropping off
a care-package for mom.

4
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,628
Ew. No.

5
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:14,697
It's the stuff that Sophia
left at my apartment.

6
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:17,333
Oh, bud.
Oh, bud.

7
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:18,768
Breakups are the worst.

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,370
Man, I just want to walk up to Sophia,

9
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:22,572
slap her in the face
and say, "Girl, you messed up."

10
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,073
You need to destroy that stuff.

11
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:25,441
You want me to crush that big box

12
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,676
into a little ball with my bare hands?

13
00:00:26,677 --> 00:00:27,910
No.

14
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,912
I'm gonna text Sophia
and give her her stuff back.

15
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:31,047
That way I'll get to see her again

16
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,715
and hopefully smell
the air around her hair.

17
00:00:32,716 --> 00:00:34,617
- That'll make me feel better.
- No, no, no, no, no.

18
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,052
Okay, you need to embrace the pain

19
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:37,086
so you can get through it.

20
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:38,588
You need catharsis.

21
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:40,923
Sarge is right.
You need to cathart.

22
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:43,092
Cathart your brains out.

23
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:44,293
Cathart all over the place.

24
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,395
That is a great point, guys.

25
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:46,429
Thank you.

26
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,430
You know who'd appreciate that a lot

27
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,865
is Sophia, I'm gonna text her.

28
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,767
I'm gonna take that phone now, Jake.

29
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:52,335
I'd like to see you try.

30
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,103
Well, you did that very easily.

31
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:55,271
Look, I understand that you're trying

32
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:56,906
to help, but I promise you,
the best thing for me

33
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,541
right now is to text Sophia.

34
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:59,876
Give me my phone?

35
00:00:59,877 --> 00:01:03,312
Okay.
Thank you.

36
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,382
And... send.

37
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:07,617
Why hasn't she written back yet?

38
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,585
Uh, this feels terrible.

39
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:10,586
You two could have stopped this,

40
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:12,552
but you didn't, you monsters.

42
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,377
Hey.

43
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:36,512
Any idea what this
emergency meeting is about?

44
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,014
Probably about how all the cell towers

45
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,682
in the city are broken,
and that's why Sophia

46
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,750
hasn't texted me back.

47
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,119
I keep checking my phone
every three seconds, like a loser.

48
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,954
Tread lightly, son.

49
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:45,955
Jacob...

50
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:47,323
Have you done any of the catharting

51
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:48,891
exercises I gave you?

52
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:52,495
Well, I don't own a bathtub, so
the first two pages are out.

53
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:53,696
And it's the middle of winter,

54
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,698
so where would I dance in a fountain?

55
00:01:55,732 --> 00:01:57,834
Indoor malls, Jake.
Indoor malls.

56
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,535
All right, squad.

57
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,704
Evry year, the Department
of Homeland Security

58
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,740
runs a multi-agency
counter-terrorism drill.

59
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,375
The team from the DOD

60
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,044
had to drop out at the last minute.

61
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:09,445
Thanks to our stellar scores

62
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:11,013
at last year's tactical village...

63
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,783
Nine-nine!

64
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:16,052
They want us to fill in.

65
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:19,288
We are the only
non-federal agency

66
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,357
ever invited to this event.

67
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:25,027
This is a huge opportunity
and we are going to nail it!

68
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,028
Nine-nine!

69
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,497
Yeah!

70
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:29,565
Charles?
Yeah?

71
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,566
You know what I'm thinking?

72
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,901
Yes, we should
pack grapes for the road.

73
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,236
No.

74
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,537
This drill couldn't
have come at a better time.

75
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,705
I'm gonna throw myself into it

76
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,440
and focus solely on getting a win,

77
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:39,408
and not whether or not
Sophia's texted me back.

78
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,177
Which she hasn't,
in case anyone was wondering.

79
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:42,178
Nine-nine!

80
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,679
Yeah!
Nine-nine!

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,180
I don't get it.

82
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:47,183
Santiago, Diaz.

83
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:49,118
Before you go, both of you requested

84
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:51,153
to have this Saturday off,
but I need one of you to work.

85
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:52,308
Oh, I could take that shift.

86
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:53,589
Well, last time you worked a Saturday,

87
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,191
you watched cartoons the entire time.

88
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:56,559
Well, that's when they're on.

89
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,862
Work this out and get back to me.

90
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:01,764
Sorry.
I can't reschedule.

91
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,099
I have tickets to a TED Talk

92
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,934
on power poses
and getting what you want

93
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,769
by using your body.

94
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:07,870
Uh-oh.

95
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,205
I hope it doesn't get too sexual.

96
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,439
"Uh-oh, I hope it
doesn't get too sexual."

97
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,540
Title of your sex tape.

98
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,142
But seriously, what is taking so long?

99
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:14,443
Also the title of your sex tape.

100
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,045
Well, I have plans on Saturday too.

101
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:17,313
I'm having dinner with my parents.

102
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:18,514
So?

103
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:20,016
You don't even like your parents.

104
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:22,551
You call them smiley
morons and hug freaks.

105
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:24,786
Plans are plans, I'm
a badass, not an anarchist.

106
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,955
I don't buy it.

107
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,324
You know, if you told me
what you were really doing,

108
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:30,159
I'd consider changing my plans.

109
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,597
But you didn't
so I'm getting Saturday off.

110
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:35,965
Are you trying to power pose me?

111
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,166
I don't know.

112
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,234
Maybe I'm supposed to be
sitting in a chair.

113
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:39,802
This is why I need to see the talk!

114
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,141
Captain, is the entire squad
at this dumb field trip?

115
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,275
Yes, they are.

116
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:47,276
Is there a problem?

117
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,045
Uh, yeah.

118
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,514
You know how I've been
defying all expectations

119
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:52,782
by going back to school?

120
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,617
I always knew you had it in you.

121
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:56,585
Can't you just be blown away by me?

122
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:57,720
I need someone to take

123
00:03:57,754 --> 00:04:00,523
this personality test
for my Psych class.

124
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:02,224
I was hoping to wow my professor

125
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:05,661
with a genuine psycho like Amy,

126
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,264
or Hitchcock, or Charles
would be great.

127
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,599
I'm not a psycho,
but I could take your test.

128
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,468
That would be awesome.

129
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,437
I do need to warn you that the results

130
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:17,340
can be... a little unflattering.

131
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:21,110
It's okay, I'm no stranger
to unflattering test results.

132
00:04:21,111 --> 00:04:23,145
Your blood pressure's normal.

133
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,381
Normal?
Take it again.

134
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:27,483
I'm not afraid
to have my flaws exposed.

135
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,585
But just to be clear,
though, it is possible

136
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:32,488
to get a result that shows no flaws?

137
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:34,657
- I guess.
- Good.

138
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,965
Good.
Can't wait to begin.

139
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,029
Sophia text you?

140
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,864
No, it's just a lightly
racist email forward

141
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,499
from my Grandma.

142
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,600
But it doesn't matter.

143
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,435
It's time to cathart.
Check it out.

144
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:47,703
Windbreaker city.

145
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,507
ATF, Marshals,
ICE, FBI, Homeland Security.

146
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,942
Welcome to the big leagues, Boyle.

147
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,076
Oh, say that again.

148
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:55,578
I want to record it
and use it as my ringtone.

149
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:56,612
Eh.

150
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:57,913
Hey, there.

151
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,149
Jake Peralta, NYPD.
Pleasure to meet a colleague.

152
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:03,319
Colleague?
Dude, read the jacket.

153
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,554
Homeland.
We're not on the same level.

154
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,390
Wow.
That was incredibly rude.

155
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:08,457
No, no, no, no.

156
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,592
I've always admired people

157
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:10,993
who decided what they wanted to be

158
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:13,362
when they were six years old
and never waivered.

159
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:15,998
Bus drivers, ice cream men.

160
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:16,999
Princesses.

161
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,002
So when exactly did you decide
you wanted to be a butt?

162
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:22,405
- Was it college?
- Law school.

163
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,540
Just wanted to let you know
that I went to law school.

164
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,709
At Butt University?

165
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,277
What are you doing?

166
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:29,812
I'm standing up for us.

167
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,347
Don't worry about it,
that guy doesn't matter.

168
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:33,382
All right.
Everybody, take their seats.

169
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:35,985
My name is Agent Kendrick,
Homeland Security.

170
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,319
And I am in charge here.

171
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:39,255
Sarge, I was wrong.
He totally matters.

172
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:40,856
This year's scenario.

173
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:42,558
Terrorists have stormed
the Capital Trust

174
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,094
bank building and have taken hostages.

175
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,362
Noice!

176
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:47,630
Oh, cool trick.

177
00:05:47,631 --> 00:05:50,666
I don't have a ton of free
time to practice high-fiving.

178
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:52,268
You just made fun of us for that.

179
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,470
For practicing, that's
the first time we ever tried it.

180
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,138
Here are your assignments.

181
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,307
ATF, you will be our terrorists.

182
00:05:58,342 --> 00:05:59,575
Ooh, that's a rough draw.

183
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,344
Homeland Security, you are
Command Control.

184
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:04,580
Marshals, Strike Team Alpha.

185
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,981
And NYPD?

186
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:08,217
Helicopter snipers, helicopter snipers.

187
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:11,020
Says here you will be our hostages.

188
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:12,154
What?

189
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:13,422
So you just want us
to lie on the ground

190
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:14,890
and do nothing, like a bunch of losers?

191
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:16,359
Yes, precisely.

192
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,328
- No.
- Jackpot.

193
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,660
Can you leave me some wiggle room

194
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,328
so I can check my phone periodically?

195
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,197
Why? Waiting for your mom
to text?

196
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:30,666
No, actually, I'm waiting
for a girl who broke up

197
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:31,834
with me to text.

198
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:34,670
- That's way worse.
- Yeah, it's bad.

199
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:35,671
This sucks.

200
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,339
I just got dumped by a mega-fox

201
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,241
and no one's letting me
shoot a big gun about it.

202
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,743
All right, you know what?
Screw this.

203
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:42,878
I'm not gonna just sit
here like a loser.

204
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,180
Boyle, free me, then I'll free you.

205
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,181
We're fighting back.

206
00:06:45,182 --> 00:06:46,282
No, Jake.

207
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:48,684
We are behaving so we can
be invited again next year.

208
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,755
Sarge, with all due respect,
I am going to completely ignore

209
00:06:52,756 --> 00:06:53,756
everything you just said.

210
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:54,890
Okay, Charles.

211
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:56,926
Our hands are tied so we're
gonna have to use our mouth.

212
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:57,927
Smart.

213
00:06:57,928 --> 00:06:58,928
Wet the tape down with my saliva

214
00:06:58,929 --> 00:06:59,962
until you could slip right out.

215
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:02,565
No, bite it.
Obviously, bite it.

216
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,834
I don't like it.
Something stinks.

217
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,001
Well, I'm sorry.

218
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,970
But I refuse to mask my natural musk

219
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,200
with a bunch of chemicals.

220
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:12,341
Uh, I was talking to Rosa
about her "dinner"

221
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:13,976
with her "parents."

222
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:16,112
I am having dinner with my parents.

223
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:17,580
Okay, liar.

224
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:18,948
What restaurant are you going to?

225
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:20,616
I don't know, some Italian place.

226
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:24,487
Oh, Italian?
Makes sense, Pinocchio.

227
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:26,889
He's a liar too, and Italian.

228
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,025
I overexplained it.

229
00:07:29,026 --> 00:07:30,459
Okay, last question.

230
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,828
What body of water
do you most identify with?

231
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,598
A, lake, B, river, C, ocean.

232
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,134
Oh, they can't be serious.
Of course I choose ocean.

233
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:39,368
I hate the ocean.

234
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:42,204
That's where that stuck-up
bitch Rose let Leo die.

235
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:45,241
There was plenty of room on that door.

236
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:48,077
Okay, the computer is tabulating.

237
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:49,712
Ohh.

238
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:52,148
You got category I9 C3 G6.

239
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:56,285
I9 C3 G6.
Is that as good as it sounds?

240
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,920
You have a robust sense of self

241
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,989
and are well suited
to leadership positions.

242
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,460
Characteristics... strength,
determination, tenacity.

243
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:06,062
Yes, I suppose that's accurate.

244
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:09,031
They do call me Tenacious Ray
down at the country club.

245
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:10,099
Because for the past 10 years,

246
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,101
I've been suing them
for discrimination.

247
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:14,036
I'm very pleased with this assessment.

248
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,338
You should be.

249
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,976
I took the test too
and I also got an I9 C3 G6.

250
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,811
What?

251
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:23,079
We got the same score?

252
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,615
It's just crazy
how accurate this thing is.

253
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,317
Yes.
Crazy.

254
00:08:28,318 --> 00:08:30,453
All right, Sarge.
Now to cut you loose.

255
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,421
No, I'm staying tied up.

256
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:34,490
I don't care how much
of a jerk Kendrick is.

257
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,325
I want it to be clear
I had no part in this.

258
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,961
No offense, but you are
a huge waste of muscles.

259
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,129
Okay, Boyle.

260
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,297
There's two guards outside this door.

261
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:42,932
We need their guns.
You know what to do.

262
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,066
Beat 'em up?

263
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,168
Pretend to be sick
and lure them in here.

264
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:46,213
Right.
The Charles.

265
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:47,770
Here we go.

266
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:48,771
Help!

267
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:50,807
I need help.
I'm sick.

268
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,708
Is this part of the drill?
What's wrong?

269
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:54,377
I have Seasonal Affective Disorder.

270
00:08:54,378 --> 00:08:55,578
What?

271
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,746
It's a serious condition
that affects millions

272
00:08:56,747 --> 00:08:59,382
of Americans.

273
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:02,819
What the hell?

274
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,288
We're fighting back,
you terrorist crap sack.

275
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:08,391
Also, thank you
for including us in this event.

276
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:09,859
You got a partner outside, right?

277
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,694
Call him in here.

278
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:13,496
I need help!

279
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,399
Ow.

280
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,900
Shh.
You're dead.

281
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,335
See you later, losers.

282
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:21,304
Again, opportunity of a lifetime.

283
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:23,539
Just a real positive experience.

284
00:09:27,845 --> 00:09:29,145
All right, we need to distract them.

285
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:30,480
Do you have anything I can throw?

286
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:31,481
I have a dog tag.

287
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:33,583
Oh, that is bad ass, Boyle.

288
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:35,485
No... it's an actual tag
for a dog.

289
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:36,652
Yep.
Molly.

290
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:38,287
She was my poodle growing up.

291
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:39,622
Never forget your first.

292
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:40,790
Your first what?

293
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:41,791
Dog.

294
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,560
That is never what people mean by that.

295
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,268
When you get to hell, say hi to Molly.

296
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,203
What?
Why is Molly in hell?

297
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:55,938
Cause it sounds cooler than heaven.

298
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:57,273
- Hiyah!
- Aah!

299
00:09:57,274 --> 00:09:58,741
- Door kick.
- What's up, dude?

300
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:00,243
- Is it lunch time?
- Is the drill over?

301
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:01,778
We're freeing you guys.

302
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:03,746
Jake, can you hear me?
Is it lunch time?

303
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:06,249
No, it's not lunch time.
It's 10:30 in the morning.

304
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:07,450
No wonder I'm starving.

305
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:09,085
Look, we came here to win

306
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:10,486
and they're not even
giving us a chance.

307
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:11,521
I think it's fair to say

308
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:12,755
that no one in the history of America

309
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:14,223
has been discriminated against more.

310
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:16,326
- Buddy.
- Yeah, that's my B. Adrenaline talking.

311
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:17,727
- So you guys in?
- I don't know.

312
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:18,695
I don't want to get in trouble.

313
00:10:18,729 --> 00:10:20,430
Oh, wow.
You sound like a real Terry.

314
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,564
Why don't you just take your shirt off

315
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:22,799
and make your pecs bounce around?

316
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,019
Again, the adrenaline.
Don't sue me.

317
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:25,335
Look, you two are still arguing about

318
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:27,670
who gets Saturday off, right?

319
00:10:27,671 --> 00:10:29,539
- Highest body count wins.
- Done.

320
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,274
I'm gonna vape you
like my e-cig.

321
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:32,942
Okay, you basically just lost.

322
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:37,380
Nine-nine, we are
hostages no longer.

323
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:39,682
You know, I really meant
to rip off the whole thing,

324
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,384
but I say we go with it!

325
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:43,319
Come with me, hos!

326
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:48,858
2-1, Diaz.

327
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:56,466
4-2, Santiago.

328
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,800
Jake, this is great.

329
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,969
I shot a guy in the face.
He is so mad at me.

330
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:01,104
Nice.

331
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:02,171
All right, this hallway is clear.

332
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,206
I think we killed them all.

333
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:04,607
It's a regular paint bath.

334
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:07,310
- Like bubble bath.
- No, like blood bath.

335
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:09,579
All right, meet in the basement.
Here we go!

336
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,214
Hyah!

337
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:14,284
Okay, me and Boyle took down six.

338
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,452
Rosa and Amy got 14.

339
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,453
Hitchcock and Scully?

340
00:11:17,454 --> 00:11:18,922
Were killed immediately.

341
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:20,189
Yeah, we're dead.

342
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,859
We also disarmed
and captured all these guys,

343
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,494
so is that all the terrorists?

344
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:25,495
Not quite.

345
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:26,663
Drop your weapons, everybody.

346
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:28,598
Drop them right now.
It's over.

347
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:29,999
You lost.

348
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,268
Drop them now or...

349
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:33,547
You're dead, crap sack.

350
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:35,171
All right, Sarge!

351
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,550
You decided to be cool.

352
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:38,107
I'm always cool.

353
00:11:38,108 --> 00:11:39,642
I also couldn't spend another second

354
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:42,312
listening to those ATF
wads bitch and moan.

355
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:45,481
Leave it to the NYPD
to screw up being hostages.

356
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:47,650
I thought cops loved to sit
around on their fat asses

357
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:48,651
all day and do nothing.

358
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:50,887
That's it.

359
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:51,888
Whoa!

360
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,656
My ass is not fat!

361
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:56,526
Kinda sounds like it was just
about your weight issues.

362
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:58,361
I'm not gonna lie,
that did strike a chord.

363
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:01,064
But I also didn't like the stuff
they were saying about us.

364
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,832
Look, I'm proud to be a cop.

365
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,934
This drill is over.
Let's get the hell outta here.

366
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,469
- Drinks on me!
- Nine-nine!

367
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,671
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God, it worked.

368
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:10,940
Let's go.

369
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:11,941
And nothing from Sophia.

370
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:13,142
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

371
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:16,246
Um, we're not quite finished yet.

372
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:19,549
I know I, for one,
am not done kicking bootay.

373
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,884
Dude, there's no more terrorists.

374
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:23,019
No, but there's more catharting to do.

375
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,522
We can make everyone
regret ever taping us

376
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:26,956
to chairs in the first place.

377
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:28,324
Sarge?

378
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:30,026
It seems unnecessary
to piss everyone off.

379
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,562
I heard one of the Marshals
call you jiggly Jeffords.

380
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:34,798
What?
Give me another clip.

381
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,399
Now we're talking.
You two are tied, right?

382
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,801
Yeah.

383
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:39,035
Settle that score.
Jake, what do you say?

384
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:40,170
Want to go after the Marshals?

385
00:12:40,171 --> 00:12:41,671
And this butt from Homeland?

386
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:42,972
Get yourself a real win?

387
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,308
I don't know, Boyle.
I mean, they're the good guys.

388
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:49,245
And that would make us...
the bad guys.

389
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,246
Noice.

390
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,182
- So you're in?
- Oh, I'm in.

391
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:54,017
I'm in all the way to hell.

392
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:57,454
And when I get there,
I'm gonna see your dog, Molly.

393
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:58,688
Let's go, squad.

394
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,356
That was really unnecessary.

395
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,996
Jake, come outside.
I've Kendrick here.

396
00:13:03,997 --> 00:13:06,447
Peralta, what are you doing?

397
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,809
You're NYPD, you're supposed
to be hostages.

398
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:10,151
Supposed to be.

399
00:13:10,152 --> 00:13:12,319
But we rose up
and took down the terrorists.

400
00:13:12,354 --> 00:13:14,455
That's right.
We're the bad guys now.

401
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:16,290
Is this some sort of game to you?

402
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,925
Does this sound like a game?

403
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:20,794
I am a terrorist leader.
My name is Francis Gruber.

404
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:22,863
My brother, Hans,
died at Nakatomi Tower

405
00:13:22,864 --> 00:13:24,298
at the hands of John McClane.

406
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:26,667
Also, I'm related to Jeremy
Irons from the third one.

407
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:28,469
Okay, so it is a game.

408
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,338
Well, I'm not playing.
Drill's over.

409
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:34,041
- Drill's over, boys.
- Yeah, that sounds right.

410
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,709
We're not on the same level.

411
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,304
And apparently, you're at
the level that can't handle us.

412
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,850
You trying to goad me, Peralta?

413
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,318
'Cause I'm in charge here
and I don't have

414
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,087
to engage with mall cops.

415
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:48,322
But I will.

416
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,191
Say it, don't spray it.

417
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,426
I'm in.
What are your demands?

418
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:53,961
A guarantee that this drill doesn't end

419
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,629
until one of us is dead.

420
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,799
Also, one large pizza
with fennel sausage.

421
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,801
Brick oven, otherwise it's sog city.

422
00:14:00,802 --> 00:14:02,369
And Scully needs some Gas-o-nex.

423
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,404
Extra strength.

424
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:04,572
Chewable!

425
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:08,375
Okay, so a fight to the death,
pizza and Gas-o-nex.

426
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:09,577
Chewable!

427
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,645
You have 30 minutes
to meet our demands.

428
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:14,458
After that, we paint ball
a hostage every 15 minutes.

429
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:16,250
Got yourself a deal, Gruber.

430
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:18,919
Get us those demands.
We'll be waiting.

431
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,254
We're not waiting one second.

432
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:21,889
Those demands were a ruse.

433
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:24,391
They were?
I really need that Gas-o-nex.

434
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:25,926
I think there was some
dairy in the cheesecake

435
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:27,127
that I ate for breakfast.

436
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:29,363
We're not gonna hang around
like sitting ducks.

437
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:30,891
We're gonna take the fight to them.

438
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,533
Like some waddling ducks!

439
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:34,668
If the waddling was
super fast and cool.

440
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,203
Like some boss-ass penguins.

441
00:14:36,204 --> 00:14:37,471
Yes!

442
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm so glad you're back
on our side, Sarge.

443
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:41,976
Okay, let's destroy some good guys.

444
00:14:43,378 --> 00:14:45,412
Gina, I was outside on business
and I purchased

445
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:47,248
a box of assorted sweet treats.

446
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:48,382
I give you the first pick.

447
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,651
Don't mind if I do.

448
00:14:50,652 --> 00:14:51,885
Curious.

449
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:53,887
On your personality test,
you said your favorite shape

450
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:55,055
was a square.

451
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:56,056
And yet now, when you're given

452
00:14:56,057 --> 00:14:58,025
a choice between round cookies

453
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:01,161
and square blondies,
you opt for the cookie.

454
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:02,730
You opt for the circle.

455
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,398
Yes, but it's not about shapes.

456
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,234
I'm choosing a cookie over a blondie.

457
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,503
I'm whimsical, but I'm not a lunatic.

458
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:12,373
For butter, eggs, flour,
sugar, baking soda,

459
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,241
chocolate, salt, vanilla.

460
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:16,477
The basic building blocks
are identical.

461
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:21,382
The only salient difference...
their shape.

462
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:24,952
You're trying to get me
bumped out of I9 C3 G6.

463
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:27,721
You don't like that the test
put us in the same category.

464
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:29,290
That is so rude.

465
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,891
Do you know how many basic bitches

466
00:15:30,892 --> 00:15:33,761
would kill to have
the same personality as me?

467
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:37,131
Gina, you know I appreciate
you but you have to admit,

468
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:38,799
we're not exactly cut
from the same cloth.

469
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,234
Apparently not.

470
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:42,036
I, of course, am an exotic silk,

471
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:44,538
whereas you, sir, are snake skin.

472
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:48,042
So you can keep your box
of deception and leave me alone.

473
00:15:48,076 --> 00:15:52,179
It's a box of shapes
and it contains only...

474
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,514
the truth.

475
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:58,385
Fennel sausage.
Jake, they did it!

476
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,587
Balcony's over there.

477
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,894
How many are out there?

478
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:08,796
Six Marshals.
We're pinned down.

479
00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:12,967
Great, it's over
and we're still tied, 8-8.

480
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:13,968
What the hell?

481
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,903
9-8.
Saturday's mine.

482
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:18,005
You said body count,
you didn't say whose body.

483
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:19,006
Boom!

484
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:20,708
Power pose.

485
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:21,709
Ahh!

486
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:37,586
- They got me.
- I'm dead too.

487
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:41,528
Kendrick?
Come out!

488
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:45,199
It's just you and me.

489
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,334
Okay, okay.
I'm outta ammo.

490
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:48,335
Be cool.

491
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:50,838
Well, well, well.
Hello, agent.

492
00:16:50,872 --> 00:16:52,106
You don't actually have to shoot me.

493
00:16:52,107 --> 00:16:53,407
We can just say that you won.

494
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,808
But I want to shoot you.

495
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,844
No way this is brick oven.

496
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,846
They were playing us, Jake!

497
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,147
Right, you're having a moment.

498
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:02,449
So.
Any last words?

499
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,817
Just don't shoot me in the face.

500
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:06,186
I got a date tonight.
I don't want it to puff up.

501
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:08,522
I'm already 10 pounds heavier
than the picture she saw.

502
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,190
Okay.

503
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:12,393
Just to clarify,
those are your last words?

504
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:13,927
Because I'm about to shoot you.

505
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:16,196
Ow!
What?

506
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:18,932
No!

507
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:20,567
Gun taped to the back.

508
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:23,637
All these Die Hard
references gave me the idea.

509
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:26,240
I got John McClane-d.

510
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:29,406
That is so much worse
than any paint ball.

511
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:32,634
Interesting tactic, detectives.

512
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,729
Show up at your first
inter-agency drill

513
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,297
and mess the whole thing up.

514
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:39,267
Less of a tactic and more
of a series of incredible events.

515
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:40,735
And what was the most
incredible event...

516
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:43,271
when I shot you in front of
all your friends?

517
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:45,206
- I have other friends.
- Who?

518
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:46,541
I knew it was a dumb idea to invite

519
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:48,610
the NYPD to a federal drill.

520
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,044
Seriously, man?

521
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:52,647
You took all our guns, taped us
to a bunch of chairs,

522
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:56,384
called us fat, and we still took
almost all of you out.

523
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:57,886
Next year, we're winning this thing.

524
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,921
Oh, you're not coming next year.

525
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:02,824
But maybe I'll see you
at the Pentagon Christmas party.

526
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:04,058
Oh, right.

527
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:05,894
You guys aren't invited to those.

528
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:10,365
Kid Rock was there.
Those are my last words, bro.

529
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:14,602
Man.
He is just a really bad dude.

530
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,571
Jake, I'm sorry you didn't
get your win.

531
00:18:16,572 --> 00:18:17,572
Are you kidding?

532
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:18,773
This was a total win.

533
00:18:18,808 --> 00:18:21,276
I haven't checked my phone in forever.

534
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:22,277
Now that I've said that,

535
00:18:22,278 --> 00:18:23,278
I do kinda want to check it, though.

536
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:25,213
I'm gonna just do it.

537
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:26,347
No text.

538
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:29,184
But I'm probably 20 percent
less devastated

539
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:30,285
than I would have been this morning.

540
00:18:30,286 --> 00:18:31,586
And that's thanks to you guys.

541
00:18:31,587 --> 00:18:33,354
I catharted.

542
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:35,156
You catharted hard.

543
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,594
Gina, I've been thinking long and hard

544
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:40,895
about what happened yesterday.

545
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,330
Oh, pray tell.

546
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,266
But remember, I'm not at your level
so do speak down to me.

547
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:46,668
I owe you an apology.

548
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,004
The test was wrong to classify
us both as I9 C3 G6's.

549
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,440
That's a terrible apology
from content to tone.

550
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:56,244
I meant I don't deserve
to be an I9 C3 G6.

551
00:18:56,245 --> 00:19:00,348
I should be an I9 C3 G4 or an I8 C5 G3,

552
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:04,886
or even an I7 C7 G8 or I2 C1 G3.

553
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,721
Is this a Rain Man impression?

554
00:19:06,722 --> 00:19:08,223
No.

555
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:10,925
Those are all personality types
not well-suited to leadership.

556
00:19:10,926 --> 00:19:12,260
Just as I have not been.

557
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,596
A good leader should never
diminish those around him.

558
00:19:14,597 --> 00:19:16,698
- It was devastating.
- Gina.

559
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,967
You're tenacious, you're strong.

560
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:20,068
You're a great leader.

561
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:22,403
And most importantly, any basic bitch

562
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:24,205
would be lucky to be like you.

563
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,341
Apology accepted.

564
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:28,209
- Can I have a huge raise?
- No.

565
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,711
But I am expanding
your responsibilities

566
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:31,012
to match your great promise.

567
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:32,881
You are now in charge
of all scheduling decisions

568
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:33,882
and budget tracking.

569
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,984
- No!
- You can do it, trust me.

570
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:40,155
From one I9 C3 G6 to another.

571
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,527
It's crazy how much he flirts with me.

572
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:49,164
Hey, so I told Captain Holt
I'd work on Saturday.

573
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,766
Wait, why?
You won fair and square.

574
00:19:51,767 --> 00:19:53,268
I mean, I murdered you.

575
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,036
That was pretty shady.

576
00:19:55,037 --> 00:19:58,440
Also, it was crazy assertive
and I feel like

577
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:00,169
maybe I don't actually need
power pose training.

578
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:01,309
You don't.

579
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,579
Mostly because nobody
needs power pose training.

580
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,314
The dinner with my parents on Saturday

581
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:08,650
is to introduce them to Marcus.

582
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,318
What?

583
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:11,653
Why didn't you just tell me?

584
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:13,254
I didn't know stuff
was getting that serious.

585
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,524
Yeah. It's very embarrassing
having feelings.

586
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:20,762
- Anyway, thank you.
- You're welcome.

587
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:25,033
Rosa's in love!

588
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,768
Power pose.

589
00:20:26,802 --> 00:20:29,771
Dropping this off for Sophia Perez.

590
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:31,139
Oh, no, you don't have to call her.

591
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,941
I'll just leave it here with you.

592
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:36,411
- Okay.
- Jake?

593
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:38,513
- Hey.
- Hi, uh.

594
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:40,682
Sorry I didn't text you back.

595
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:42,417
Thanks for bringing my things.

596
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:44,552
Well, I need to move on

597
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:48,323
and having this stuff
around makes that difficult, so.

598
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:49,924
Including this
multi-surface cleaner?

599
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,127
Well, I only bought
that to impress you.

600
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:54,729
And it worked, so...

601
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,765
All right, well, I should probably...

602
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:58,500
get back to arresting bad guys.

603
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:02,837
Yeah, I should, uh, get back
to proving they're not so bad.

604
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:05,607
Jake and Sophia.
Enemies for life.

605
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,642
Like McClane and Gruber.

606
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:08,743
You're the Gruber.

607
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:10,545
You're the Gruber.

608
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:11,646
I'll see you in court, Jake.

609
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:16,618
Okay. Bye.

610
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:20,155
Tell me if she turns back
for one last look.

611
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,523
She turning?

612
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,758
Did she turn?
Did she turn?

613
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:27,907
