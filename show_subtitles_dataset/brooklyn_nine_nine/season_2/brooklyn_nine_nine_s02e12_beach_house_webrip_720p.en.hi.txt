1
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:05,808
Interesting.

2
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:10,547
Very, very interesting.

3
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:11,981
Guys.

4
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:13,349
Captain Holt has no pants on.

5
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:14,617
Um...

6
00:00:14,652 --> 00:00:15,652
What?

7
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:17,620
He has no pants on, is what.

8
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:18,721
Here are the facts:

9
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:20,290
At 11:55 A.M.,

10
00:00:20,324 --> 00:00:23,426
Captain Holt walked past us
holding a hot bowl of soup.

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,095
At 12:03 P.M., I heard him yell...

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,130
Ouch!

13
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:30,533
Then at 12:07, he
called Gina into his office.

14
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:31,968
She entered, holding nothing.

15
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:35,138
One minute later, she
left holding an opaque bag.

16
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:37,974
Captain Holt's pants were in that bag.

17
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,342
His knees are in the breeze.

18
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:40,810
He's in his undies.

19
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:42,812
That evidence is circumstantial.

20
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:44,814
Oh, so you guys want visual confirmation?

21
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:45,849
- No.
- Not really.

22
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:46,850
Done.

23
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:48,084
Hey, Captain.

24
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:50,019
I just need you to sign
something at my desk real quick.

25
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:52,088
Just leave it on the couch.

26
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:53,990
- Dismissed.
- Okay.

27
00:00:54,024 --> 00:00:55,725
Sir, you're gonna freak.

28
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,561
Yo-Yo Ma is in the precinct, and
he's giving out autographs.

29
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:01,064
Yo-Yo Ma is on tour
in Australia right now.

30
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:03,233
How would you know that?

31
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:05,268
Sir, I'm choking on a lozenge!

32
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:07,270
I'm gonna die!

33
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,639
- I got you, Jake!
- No, no.

34
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:10,673
Stop. I swallowed it.

35
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,075
I swallowed it. It's fine.

36
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:13,643
Hey, hey.

37
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:14,878
I made you another bowl of soup

38
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:16,646
since you spilled yours earlier,

39
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,249
but you're gonna have to
come over here to get it.

40
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:21,017
All right, Peralta, I'm
sick of you wasting time,

41
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:22,852
so, yes, I spilled some
minestrone on my pants,

42
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:24,053
and I'm sitting in my underwear.

43
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,088
Happy?

44
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,756
Yes.

45
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,024
Ah.

46
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:30,827
Sir, I need you to sign off on...

47
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,396
look at us, just three people with pants on

48
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,131
having a normal conversation.

49
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,066
Yep. No story here.

for hosting us at his
beach house this year.

62
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,110
Yeah.

63
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:16,513
You should really thank my ex-wife.

64
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:17,580
We split it in the divorce.

65
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:20,250

Yeah, that's not really catching on.

- Aw.
- As always, there will be no spouses,

69
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,724
no bosses, no work...

70
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:28,959
No bedtimes,

within reason.

00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:32,228
All right, Santiago's feeling rowdy.

00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:33,363
Who else is feeling it?

74
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:34,764
I can't wait.

75
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,933
This weekend, I am Vacation Terry.

76
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:39,169
No kids, no responsibilities.

77
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:42,405
I'm just a balloon floating
in the great blue sky,

78
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,975
and I am untethered.

79
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:46,176
And just to clarify,

80
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,878
how untethered is Vacation
Terry from his wife?

81
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:49,980
Very tethered.

82
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:51,748
All right, anyone else have questions?

83
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,483
Hitchcock, Scully, you've
been weirdly silent.

84
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:55,986
We didn't want to say anything
that would get us uninvited.

85
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,654
Smart. All right, get pumped, people.

86
00:02:57,688 --> 00:02:59,756
Dog Party '15, ooh-ooh!

87
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:05,962
Two bottles of vodka.

88
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:09,099
Is this gonna be the weekend
we finally meet six-drink Amy?

89
00:03:09,133 --> 00:03:11,568
Six-drink Amy? What does that mean?

90
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:14,871
It's the pinnacle of the
Santiago drunkenness scale.

91
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:18,241
One drink, Amy's a little spacey.

92
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:19,709
Wait. What?

93
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:21,645
Two drinks: Loud Amy.

94
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,513
You want to get a cab?

95
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,614
Three drinks:

96
00:03:24,649 --> 00:03:26,683
Amy dance pants.

97
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,718
Four-drink Amy is a bit of a pervert.

98
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:30,420
Hey, check it out.

99
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:35,258
And five-drink Amy
is weirdly confident.

100
00:03:35,293 --> 00:03:38,261
Let's do this, little man.

101
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:41,298
But I've never seen six-drink Amy.

102
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:44,434
Maybe she's the one I could
actually be friends with,

103
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:48,071
aka my sasquatch.

104
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:55,745
Hey, there, beautiful.

105
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,814
Marcus, what are you doing here?

106
00:03:57,848 --> 00:03:59,115
I know you lost your phone charger,

107
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,550
so I got you a new one,
and I want to make sure

108
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:01,651
your phone's all juiced up

109
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:03,887
for some sweet long-distance texting.

110
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:05,388
Thanks. What do I owe you?

111
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:07,023
It's a gift.

112
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:08,425
All you got to say is thank you.

113
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,994
I said thank you. That
was the first thing I said.

114
00:04:11,028 --> 00:04:13,396
Sorry. You're nice.

115
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:14,431
I'll text you.

116
00:04:14,432 --> 00:04:15,732
Can't wait.

117
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:16,766
Inappropriate work kiss.

118
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:17,767
Too fast. Can't stop me.

119
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:26,009
Rosa D macking down with
her boo on the street!

120
00:04:26,043 --> 00:04:27,477
I love it.

121
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:29,646
Say "boo" again, I will
shoot you in the stomach.

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,981
Fine. "Lover boy" it is.

123
00:04:31,015 --> 00:04:32,175
What did I just say, Charles?

124
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:33,383
- What did I just say?
- You said...

125
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:34,417
you said not to say it.

126
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,627
Peralta, I thought you already left.

127
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:38,955
Yeah, I closed a couple of cases

128
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,390
and had to finish up the paperwork.

129
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,225
Also, I wanted to thank you again

130
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,226
for giving us this half day.

131
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:44,461
Yes, of course.

132
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:46,663
I understand how important
these extravaganzas are.

133
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,298
I'm sure you'll have a hoot.

134
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:49,766
Oh, yeah, although I'm sure our hoots

135
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,520
pale in comparison to
the hoots that you had

136
00:04:51,535 --> 00:04:52,535
back in the day.

137
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,404
I bet things got supes hoots.

138
00:04:54,438 --> 00:04:56,673
Actually, I wasn't privy to those events.

139
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:57,974
As a gay black detective,

140
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,510
I was excluded from most social gatherings.

141
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:02,712
You guys off to play some golf?

142
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:04,814
Yeah. You want to caddy?

143
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:07,617
No, I do not.

144
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:08,919
Yeah.

145
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:10,720
Golf sucks.

146
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:12,022
I know that wasn't the point of your story.

147
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:13,890
- Those guys were jerks.
- Yes.

148
00:05:13,925 --> 00:05:16,826
But I do envy the camaraderie they shared.

149
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:19,362
I've always wanted to
Josh around with my peers.

150
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:21,564
So you've never joshed around with anyone?

151
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:22,832
Never.

152
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:25,235
But go have fun with the squad.

153
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:26,836
Really Josh around for me.

154
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:33,209
Welcome to château boy-Al.

155
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:36,713
Eleanor told me to keep the
place clean, but I don't care.

156
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:39,716
Mommy's out of town, and we're gonna party.

157
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,384
You call your ex-wife mommy?

158
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:42,419
Not consciously.

159
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,721
This will do just fine.

160
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:45,755
You brought pineapple?

161
00:05:45,756 --> 00:05:47,424
Well, the fanny runs deep.

162
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,859
I am prepared for any vacation situation.

163
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:53,396
I've got a bottle opener,
sunscreen, inflatable neck pillow.

164
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:55,932
Wait. Are we having...

165

♪ is a total surprise to everyone ♪

184
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:36,714
Okay, well, Captain,

185
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:39,449
the only free bedroom is my ex-wife's,

186
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,850
which is strictly off-limits.

187
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:43,086
She locks the door and takes
the handle home with her.

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,155
All right, you can have my bed.

189
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:46,289
Charles, I'll take yours.

190
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,323
Problem solved.

191
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:48,458
I'll sleep on the floor.

192
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,126
Captain, come with me.

193
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:53,563
What the hell, Jake?

194
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:54,597
No bosses.

195
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:56,166
Look, he told me this story

196
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,468
about how his squad always excluded him,

197
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:02,806
and I know I come across
as a cynical, badass cop

198
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,774
with a checkered past and a thirst for...

199
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:06,276
I felt bad.

200
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,610
You would've too.

201
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,712
Guys, he just wants to josh around.

202
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:10,747
Is that so bad?

203
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,048
I am dating his nephew.

204
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:13,583
Now we're hanging out on weekends?

205
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:15,151
What is next?

206
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:17,454
Small talk.

207
00:07:17,488 --> 00:07:19,522
Okay, Amy, you got to be
glad that Holt's here, right?

208
00:07:19,557 --> 00:07:20,824
I mean, you're basically in love with him.

209
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,292
I love him.

210
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:25,662
I'm not in love with him, but
I'm definitely not comfortable

211
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,896
being drunk around him.

212
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,832
Ames, please keep the volume down, okay?

213
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,266
Sorry. It's two drinks.

214
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:31,801
I can't help it. That's it.

215
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:33,103
I'm cutting myself off.

216
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:36,106
So Jake messes up, and
you punish me for it?

217
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,108
Come on, Amy. You're better than that.

218
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,076
You guys, this is gonna be fine.

219
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:41,945
I mean, Terry's our boss, and
he comes with us every year.

220
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:44,180
You bring Vacation Terry,

221
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:46,649
and he is no man's boss.

222
00:07:46,684 --> 00:07:50,520
When the slippers are
filled, Terry is chilled.

223
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,021
We're happy the captain's here.

224
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:54,824
Thank you, Scully and
Hitchcock, the voice of reason.

225
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:56,893
Holt's the big fish we've been waiting for.

226
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,295
We have an exciting investment
opportunity to pitch him.

227
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,097
- What?
- It's an offshore casino

228
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,899
that's currently sunk
off the coast of Delaware.

229
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,033
No, all right, you guys are both

230
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,835
officially uninvited
from this whole weekend.

231
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,804
Too late. We drove up as a group.

232
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,172
There's no getting rid of us.

233
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,373
- Ah.
- Sorry, Jake.

234
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,474
This weekend's gonna suck.

235
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:12,942
All right, you know what?

236
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:16,212
You guys are being a bunch of
racist, homophobic golf cops,

237
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:19,049
and I for one think this
weekend's gonna be even more fun

238
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,084
because Holt is here.

239
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:22,685
Hey, what are you doing down here?

240
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Lunch is ready.

241
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,188
- I'm texting Marcus.
- Mm.

242
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:26,656
Texting...

243
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,492
that's the most intimate
thing you can do to a lover

244
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:31,628
with your fingers...

245
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:33,363
other than washing their hair.

246
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,598
So I texted Marcus, and
he hasn't texted me back.

247
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,734
I can't believe I'm asking
this, but can you help me?

248
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,602
Oh, Rosa, yes.

249
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:41,738
I am the perfect person for this job.

250
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,306
Okay, let's get busy.

251
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,574
What was his initial text?

252
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,742
"I can't believe I miss you this much

253
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,177
after three hours, X.O."

254
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,646
X.O.? Girl, marry him.

255
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,448
- What'd you write back?
- "Ha-ha, lame."

256
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:53,550
It's a joke. I was insulting him.

257
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:55,051
You know, flirting.

258
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:56,086
Think he's mad?

259
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,987
I bet he's heartbroken.

260
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:59,522
No, no. We can fix this.

261
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:02,759
We just have to write a very
sweet, very heartfelt text

262
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,661
that will jump-start the conversation.

263
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:05,862
"Hey, baby."

264
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:07,130
I don't call people "baby."

265
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:08,498
You do now.

266
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:11,835
So how do you all typically blow off steam?

267
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,236
Does anyone have any formal complaints

268
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,350
about the work environment?

269
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,106
No, no, we usually just gossip, right?

270
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,474
Yeah.

271
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:19,142
Hey, did everyone see Dave
from downstairs this week?

272
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:20,176
He shaved his beard.

273
00:09:20,177 --> 00:09:21,177
Oh, my God.

274
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,645
His whole face looks like a butt.

275
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:26,016
Ha-ha, Butt Face Dave.

276
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,450
Butt Face Dave, that's his new name,

277
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,445
butt face Dave, 'cause
his face looks like a butt.

278
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:32,789
I like David. He's a good cop.

279
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,494
- Yeah.
- David is great.

280
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:39,996
- He's a good dude.
- I like that guy.

281
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,097
I'd like to propose a toast.

282
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:42,866
- Good idea. Great idea.
- Mm!

283
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,401
Amy, you don't have a drink?

284
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:45,602
Oh, no, it's okay. I don't...

285
00:09:45,636 --> 00:09:47,504
The captain's making a toast.

286
00:09:47,538 --> 00:09:49,072
Don't be rude, Prude.

287
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:51,574
Okay, I guess I'll have one more.

288
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,043
You're on vacation. Who's counting?

289
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:55,211
I am.

290
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:57,314
Thank you for inviting me up.

291
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,349
To joshing around together.

292
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:00,784
- Cheers.
- To joshing!

293
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:02,986
Joshing.

294
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,454
This is fun.

295
00:10:04,488 --> 00:10:06,623
Ooh, you know what we could do after lunch?

296
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:07,724
Walk on the beach.

297
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:08,792
But it's the middle of winter.

298
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,427
Which is ideal, you know?

299
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:12,095
Not too hot, no crowds.

300
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,697
The sand doesn't get everywhere

301
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:15,165
'cause it's basically frozen.

302
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,567
Exactly. Who brought their beach boots?

303
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,536
"I did."

304
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,739
Spot-on Rosa impression.

305
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:26,810
This is nice.

306
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:31,081
I mean, the wind is unexpected
but welcome and bracing.

307
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:32,382
Yeah.

308
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,584
It's like a thousand
little needles of happiness

309
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:37,153
shooting into your face.

310
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,789
Well, we've been walking
for about 20 minutes, so...

311
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:42,659
So we should probably
turn around in another 20.

312
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:44,127
Good plan...

313
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,863
- an 80-minute walk on the beach.
- Mm.

314
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,264
I'm so cold.

315
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,900
Even my fiery dance moves
aren't keeping me warm.

316
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:53,670
The trick is, you got to be prepared.

317
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,338
Mini cognac, ladies?

318
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,707
Oh, yeah!

319
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:00,410
Oh, warm me up, you little bastard.

320
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,212
- Mm.
- Four drinks.

321
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,580
Mm, mm, mm.

322
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:05,715
Thank you, Terry's fanny.

323
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,917
And thank you, Poseidon,

324
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:12,322
great God of the sea!

325
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:15,358
What are you wearing?

326
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:16,860
A T-shirt.

327
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:18,061
I only brought a bikini.

328
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,297
Seems weird to be in front of
the captain in a bathing suit.

329
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,499
Got to cover up them thangs, yeah?

330
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:25,568
You can still see
them through your shirt.

331
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,138
So here we all are, finally relaxing

332
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:30,707
as a squad together in the tub.

333
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:31,741
It's fun, huh?

334
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:33,376
I can't hear anyone.

335
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:34,911
Can we please turn off the jets?

336
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:37,314
Yeah.

337
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:41,451
That's better.

338
00:11:41,485 --> 00:11:43,420
No more disturbed water.

339
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,487
Good call.

340
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:47,190
Wow, without the bubbles, you
can really see everything.

341
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:49,292
Eyes up here, Peralta.

342
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:53,563
And... snip.

343
00:11:53,598 --> 00:11:55,198
Mazel tov.

344
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:56,733
Captain, I bet you used to smoke cigars

345
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,368
on the job all the time, right?

346
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:00,036
No, but I had a partner who did.

347
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,072
Had one burning all day long.

348
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:03,506
Dan Hammer.

349
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,475
That name is so cool, it
doesn't need a nickname.

350
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,043
Ah, but he had one.

351
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:08,078
Snake Eyes.

352
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:09,579
Oh, Snake Eyes is a great one.

353
00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:10,680
Oh, yeah.

354
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:12,949
He was the toughest son
of a bitch I ever met.

355
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:15,218
When he died, he stuck
out his middle finger

356
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:17,387
so he'd be flipping
everyone off at his funeral.

357
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:20,090
- Oh, that rules.
- Yeah.

358
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:21,224
Who killed him?

359
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,727
Don't say a white tiger on
cocaine, 'cause I will lose it.

360
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:27,364
No, cancer of the mouth,
tongue, lip, and cheek.

361
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:30,133
Hmm.

362
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,369
Well, still, the middle
finger thing is cool.

363
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,670
Actually, no one got to see that.

364
00:12:33,704 --> 00:12:35,304
It was closed casket because the doctors

365
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:37,073
had removed so much of his face.

366
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:38,675
All right, that's that.

367
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:42,178
All right, I admit it.

368
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,613
It's weird having the captain here.

369
00:12:43,648 --> 00:12:45,248
It straight up sucks.

370
00:12:45,283 --> 00:12:46,483
Should we just go home?

371
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:47,484
What do you think, Terry?

372
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:50,487
I am not going anywhere.

373
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,322
I'm playing kwazy kupcakes.

374
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:55,926
I'm hydrated as hell, and I'm
listening to Sheryl Crow.

375
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,360
I've got my own party going on.

376
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:58,395
Wait a minute.

377
00:12:58,396 --> 00:13:01,364
Vacation Terry, you're a genius.

378
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,701
We'll have two parties, a fun
one down here with just us

379
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:06,269
and then an awkward, uncomfortable one

380
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:07,464
in the living room with Holt.

381
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:09,406
He doesn't even have to know about it.

382
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,508
Separate parties, separate but equal...

383
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,076
forget I said that phrase.

384
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:17,608
Ok, we don't have much time.
Captain's in the bathroom,

385
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:19,082
and we all know how
efficient he is in there.

386
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:20,637
Here's the plan: The boring Holt party

387
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:21,618
will be in the living room.

388
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,019
At least three of us must be with him

389
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,454
in that room at all times.

390
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:26,249
It's not a party if
there aren't four people.

391
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:28,158
Especially between the sheets.

392
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:30,093
The other party will be in here.

393
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:32,129
Shifts at each party will
be 20 minutes and staggered.

394
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:33,163
Any questions?

395
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:34,597
How do you get your hair like that?

396
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:36,066
Born this way... also, Hitchcock and Scully

397
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,601
are not to be left alone with the captain.

398
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,102
They'll annoy him into leaving his party

399
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:40,670
with their weird sunken casino idea.

400
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:43,040
It's not an idea. It's a scheme.

401
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:45,308
Okay, that is way worse.

402
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,743
I think this is gonna work.

403
00:13:46,778 --> 00:13:47,978
And who knows?

404
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:50,614
Maybe the Holt party will even be fun.

405
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:52,816
Now, the recorder is generally thought of

406
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,119
as a training instrument for
children, but listen to it.

407
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:59,089

Hey, Captain.

How much does it cost
to raise a sunken ship?

454
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,696

makes in a year hopefully.

455

sandwich in the other room

We lost track of who was where, sorry.

Guys, if we're gonna pull
this off, we need to focus.

- You want to play?
- Yeah, I want to play.

464
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:03,747
It's quarters. What, am I a monster?

465
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:06,016
Terry, tag me in. You're
on Holt party duty.

466

drive is four-wheel drive.

You need something. Who needs something?

468

I know they say it's not good
to have a TV in the bedroom,

469
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:20,964
which is...

470
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,099

supposed to be upstairs?

00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:37,347
Not now. It's schnapps time.

475
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:39,116
Okay, Amy and Hitchcock are still upstairs.

476

Oh, no.

480
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:49,893
Six-drink Amy isn't fun.

481
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,728
She's just sad. Damn it.

00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:53,597
Guys, this is really bad.

483
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:54,898
Got to get up there.

484
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:56,133

485
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:58,969
Ah, Detectives.

486
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,672
You were having a party without me.

487
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:03,840
- Captain...
- No need to explain.

488
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:09,212
This is gonna sound controversial,

489
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,381
but I think that went pretty good.

490
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:15,018
Man, I've never seen Captain
Holt that upset before.

491
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,347
He looks like a sad block of granite.

492
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:18,482
What are we gonna do?

493
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:20,450
How do you cheer up granite?

494
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:21,985
Well, you could salvage it,

495
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,687
much like the casino we've been talk...

496
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:25,722
- Seriously, stop.
- I feel awful.

497
00:17:25,757 --> 00:17:28,525
My fanny's not deep enough to fix this.

498
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,528
Vacation Terry...

499
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,363
- is dead.
- The fanny.

500
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:34,698
I'm gonna go talk to Captain Holt.

501
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:36,199
No, don't do that.

502
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:37,334
I invited him up here.

503
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:38,869
I should go talk to him.

504
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,637
- Okay.
- What?

505
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,105
Really thought you were
gonna fight me on that,

506
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,440
and then we'd have a
whole back-and-forth,

507
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,575
and eventually you'd go,
"Jake, I respect you",

508
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,810
but I got to do this."

509
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:48,345
No, it's uncomfortable.

510
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:49,613
I'd much rather you do it.

511
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:51,615
All right, fine.

512
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:53,650
Here I go.

513
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,921
- You're walking in place.
- All right!

514
00:17:58,045 --> 00:17:59,813
Hey, I need to write Marcus back fast.

515
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:01,314
He's already freaked out
by how long it takes me

516
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,682
to text him back.

517
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,485
Listen, Rosa, there's nothing
I'd rather do in my life

518
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,587
than write a sexy text to your boyfriend,

519
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:09,389

you got to do on your own.

520
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,790
Why?

521
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,125
You're so good at being lame, and I'm not.

522
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,593
- Yeah.
- Look, I like him.

523
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:14,761
I really like him.

524
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,096
I don't want to screw this crap up.

525
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,497
That's what you should say.

526
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:20,100
Just take that sentiment,
remove the word "crap,"

527
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:22,068
and then send it.

528
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:25,872
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:27,040
Gah, I sent it.

530
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:28,275
He didn't write back, so he hates it.

531
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,076
No, wait. Look.

532
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:33,446
Okay, oh, okay, "dot, dot, dot."

533
00:18:33,481 --> 00:18:34,514
It's happening.

534
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,416
It's a shirtless pic.

535
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,553
We did it. We did it!

536
00:18:39,587 --> 00:18:40,787
Thanks, Boyle.

537
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,789
Okay, I'm gonna leave. Don't follow me.

538
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:43,890
Things are about to get intense.

539
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,125
Makes sense.

540
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:48,295
Ames.

541
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,230
Gina.

542
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:52,566
You got to see the sasquatch.

543
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,100
Was it everything you drumpt?

544
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:57,137
It was the stuff drumps are made of.

545
00:18:57,171 --> 00:19:00,140
Can you hold my eyes still
till things stop spinning?

546
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,274
Okay, let's sit you up.

547
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,509
There. Easy does...

548
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:04,911
there... oh, there you go.

549
00:19:04,946 --> 00:19:06,780
Now drink this entire glass of water.

550
00:19:07,014 --> 00:19:09,749
You're taking care of me.

551
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,618
Just cause I know you won't remember it.

552
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,788
Mm-mm, no.

553
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:15,989
You like me.

554
00:19:16,023 --> 00:19:19,226
Six-drink Amy is your friend.

555
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:24,631
And... and she's gonna
be very sick right now.

556
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:25,665
Okay.

557
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,238
I heard you were out here.

558
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:32,639
Really hate those jets, huh?

559
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,841
I'm not a child. I
don't need a bubble bath.

560
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:38,912
So listen.

561
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,866
Before you say anything,
I want to say I'm sorry.

562
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:42,649
You're sorry?

563
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,985
Wow, I can't believe I
almost made Terry do this.

564
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,253
Apology accepted.

565
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:47,487
I was so eager to make up

566
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,189
for all the joshing around I'd missed,

567
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,691
I forgot this getaway is
really for you detectives.

568
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:54,628
And one of the things you're
striving to get away from

569
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:55,896
is your captain.

570
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,432
Yeah, I mean, it's nothing
against you as a person.

571
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:02,469
Everyone loves you, but
you're our captain,

572
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,771
and normally we get really drunk

573
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,040
and act like crazy idiots
and play stupid games

574
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:08,975
where we make fun of the boss.

575
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,145
Which is hard when the boss is present.

576
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,246
Yeah.

577
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,183
But not impossible.

578
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:19,786
I think instead of us rising to your level,

579
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,656
it's maybe time for you
to stoop down to ours.

580
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,233
And that's just the start.

581
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:36,269
I call the game "Real Ray or Fake Ray?"

582
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,572
And joining us is a
very special contestant,

583
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,206
Captain Ray Holt himself.

584
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:45,679
All right, here's how the game works.

585
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:46,780
I will say a phrase.

586
00:20:46,814 --> 00:20:48,048
You tell me if I made it up

587
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,849
or if it's something that Captain Holt

588
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:53,019
actually said in real life
to an actual human being.

589
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,521
I understand the logic of this game.

590
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:57,057
Great! Phrase number one:

591
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,459
"The futility of lighting candles

592
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:00,994
only to blow them out immediately

593
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:04,364
is just one reason I find
children's birthday parties

594
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:05,665
impractical."

595
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
- Holt.
- That's Holt.

596
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,701
Mm, fake.

597
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,002
I say fake too.

598
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,604
I don't remember saying
it, so it must be fake.

599
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:11,638
It was real!

600
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:12,672
Oh!

601
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,975
To Terry's kids at their birthday party.

602
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,076
Oh, I remember now.

603
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,310
Oh, do another one. Do another one.

604
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:18,812
All right, phrase number two:

605
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:22,115
"Any smile that lasts longer
than a second and a half

606
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,684
is a con man's ruse."

607
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,419
That's fake. That's a fake one.

608
00:21:26,454 --> 00:21:27,787
I said it.

609
00:21:27,822 --> 00:21:29,256
And I meant it!

610
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,790
Oh!

611
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,728
Not a doctor. Shh.

612
