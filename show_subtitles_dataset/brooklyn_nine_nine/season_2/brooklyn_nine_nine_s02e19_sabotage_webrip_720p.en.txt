1
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:04,179
The muggings were
confined to Cabot Street.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,414
They began over
two months ago...

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:06,715
Just like this briefing did.

4
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:08,417
Please go to charisma class.

5
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:09,985
I'm here. I'm here.
Sorry, Charles.

6
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:11,253
No, Jake.

7
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,388
Never apologize for
making an amazing entrance.

8
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:14,523
My power went out last night,

9
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:15,657
and my alarm didn't go off.

10
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:17,759
Your alarm is power-dependent?

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,294
You brought this
on yourself, son.

12
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:21,163
The point is,
it will not happen again.

13
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:22,931
Carry on.

14
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:23,932
Sorry I'm late, Sarge.

15
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:24,966
No hot water this morning.

16
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,703
But I'm here, ready to go.

17
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:29,403
Will cause no
further distractions.

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,074
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Seriously?

19
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,509
What is your excuse today?

20
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,510
More bad luck.

21
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:35,711
My car ran out of gas,

22
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:37,846
and then my clothes
disappeared from the Laundromat.

23
00:00:37,847 --> 00:00:39,882
I had to beg one of my neighbors
to loan me some of his.

24
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:41,783
You never told us Sinbad
lives in your building.

25
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:42,985
If Sinbad lived in my building,

26
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:44,152
I would have a tattoo
on my forehead

27
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:45,753
that said "Sinbad
lives in my building."

28
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,690
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here,

29
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,492
and I'm a half an hour early.

30
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:53,629
That's right, my string of bad
luck has finally come to an end.

31
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,330
Peralta, you failed
your drug test.

32
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:57,499
There were traces
of cocaine and methamphetamines

33
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,310
- found in your urine.
- What?

34
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:21,490
Captain, this is insane.

35
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:22,691
I don't do drugs.

36
00:01:22,692 --> 00:01:24,393
I mean, sure, a couple
of my teeth are loose,

37
00:01:24,394 --> 00:01:26,495
but that's from dental neglect,
not meth.

38
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:27,896
Yeah, those tests
are unreliable.

39
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:29,698
Okay, let's not blame "tests."

40
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:30,766
I believe in you, Jake,

41
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:32,568
but come on,
he's going after tests.

42
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:33,569
Sir, listen:

43
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,337
the missing laundry,
the hot water,

44
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:36,337
the power, the gas,

45
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:37,406
now this?

46
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:39,074
This is not bad luck,
it's a pattern.

47
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,676
Someone's trying to sabotage me.

48
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:41,809
And who would want to do that?

49
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:42,945
Probably someone I put away.

50
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:44,012
It's the only explanation.

51
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:45,347
Or you didn't pay your bills

52
00:01:45,348 --> 00:01:46,915
and you only put a quarter
gallon of gas in your tank

53
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,750
'cause you wanted to spend the
rest on mini-mart beef jerky.

54
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:50,252
Wrong, I buy my jerky online

55
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:51,787
from the world's
top jerkmasters,

56
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:53,922
so it looks like you need
to update your jerk Rolodex,

57
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:55,591
which is not as dirty
as it sounds.

58
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:58,193
Anyway, I can prove that I
filled up my tank, all right?

59
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,361
I even have a receipt,

60
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:02,297
because I keep all my receipts

61
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:04,032
like a mature adult person.

62
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:05,434
Laser tag,

63
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:06,935
wheelie shoes,

64
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:09,137
remote control monster truck,

65
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:10,138
aha!

66
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,139
Gas station.

67
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,139
Someone drained my tank.

68
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,542
Okay, I know you don't do drugs,

69
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,544
so maybe there is something
to what you're saying.

70
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,746
I'll talk to One Police Plaza
and arrange an appeal.

71
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:20,514
I'll also put someone
on this sabotage theory.

72
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,650
I got it.

73
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:23,051
Jake, when I find
whoever did this to you,

74
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm gonna rip out their eyeballs
and fill their sockets...

75
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,588
I think you might be
too close to this.

76
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:27,589
Copy that.

77
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,290
Santiago, Diaz: look into it.

78
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:30,592
Noice.

79
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:32,060
In the meantime, Peralta,
you're suspended.

80
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,494
I'm gonna need you to hand in
your badge and gun.

81
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,997
All right, fine,
you can have my badge and gun,

82
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:36,231
but we're doing it
in your office

83
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:37,566
so I can slam them
down on your desk

84
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:38,934
and yell out,
"The system stinks!"

85
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:40,802
Actually, the procedure is
to bring your gun and badge

86
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:42,404
down to the equipment room
on the second floor,

87
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:44,773
fill out form 452-underscore-J,

88
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:46,808
hand said form in
to the inventory clerk,

89
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:49,411
and then receive a claim check
through interoffice mail.

90
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,179
The system stinks!

91
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,481
Hey, Boyle,

92
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:54,116
any progress with
that extortion case

93
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:55,484
you and Jake
have been working on?

94
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,919
No, I've just been
going over his notes.

95
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,589
Look how cool and illegible
his handwriting is.

96
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,391
Oh, I wish I could be that free.

97
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,192
But you know me,
ever the calligrapher.

98
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:07,829
Yeah, well, I thought you might
need a little more manpower.

99
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,830
Okay.

100
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:10,532
So I'm assigning you
a new partner.

101
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,068
Actually, partners.

102
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:15,303
Yep, there's definitely
something in there.

103
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:16,337
Looks like a peanut.

104
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:18,073
Bet it's a cashew.

105
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,074
You're on.

106
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:20,909
No, Sarge, come on!

107
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,044
They're terrible.

108
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:23,645
Stop exaggerating, Boyle.

109
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:25,580
They're good detectives.

110
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,581
They're fine.

111
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,582
Oh, no.

112
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,649
I pushed it in deeper.

113
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:31,420
They're all we got.

114
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,188
Sir,

115
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:35,724
Gina's dance concert
was last night.

116
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,426
Right.

117
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,494
The Dancy Reagan performance.

118
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:41,530
I've been so preoccupied
with Peralta's drug test,

119
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:42,664
it totally slipped my mind.

120
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:43,865
Me too.

121
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,367
But don't worry.

122
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,501
I told her we were there.

123
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,904
Was your favorite move
"The Gull"?

124
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:50,639
Or was it "Space Bubbles"?

125
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,441
Oh, I loved them both!

126
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:54,576
I'm a bubble man

127
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:55,810
and a gull man!

128
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,380
You lied to her?

129
00:03:58,381 --> 00:03:59,381
Like a pro.

130
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:00,682
I couldn't hurt her feelings.

131
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,350
She really wanted
us to be there.

132
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,220
Well, I wish you hadn't
involved me in your deception.

133
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:08,490
I maintain a strict
code of integrity.

134
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,858
Come on, Captain.

135
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:12,226
You never told a white lie
to make a person feel better?

136
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:15,697
I only lie when someone's
safety is at risk.

137
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,666
Or if a juvenile aged
eight years or younger

138
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,167
asks about Santa Claus.

139
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:20,167
In which case...

140
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:22,037
I feed them some reassuring pap

141
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:24,806
about the logical impossibility
of proving a negative.

142
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,641
It's sentimental drivel,

143
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,276
but they eat it up.

144
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,479
So...

145
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,582
does this mean you're
gonna blow up my spot

146
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,950
and tell Gina the truth?

147
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:36,885
If she asks me, then yes,

148
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:40,888
I suppose I will have to
blow your spot right up.

149
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,092
Okay, this is
everyone I could think of

150
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:45,360
who would want to
mess with my life.

151
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:46,762
Perps,
people I've testified against,

152
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:47,963
the old guy
who lived underneath me

153
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:49,531
when I was learning
the Gangnam Style dance.

154
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:51,066
Wow, you've pissed off
a lot of people.

155
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,501
Well, that's what happens
when you live out loud, Rosa.

156
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:55,904
We need to look into
the power outage and hot water.

157
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:57,339
Do you have proof
you pay your bills?

158
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,440
Are you serious?

159
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:00,342
Guys, this is not my fault.

160
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,110
My reputation is being sabotaged

161
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,378
by some guy.

162
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,379
Or girl, you know.

163
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,781
Monsters can be women too.

164
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:07,282
Super progressive
attitude, Jake.

165
00:05:07,283 --> 00:05:08,650
Look, we are on your side.

166
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:10,352
It's just, you're not
the most responsible person.

167
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,419
We have to do our job.

168
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,188
All right, fine.
You can see my bank records.

169
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,890
But I always pay my power bill.

170
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,191
Often late.

171
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:18,493
One time in person
with Canadian pennies.

172
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:20,128
Oh, my God, talking
about your finances

173
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:21,462
makes me sweat behind the knees.

174
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:22,497
Nice.

175
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:23,497
Hey, speaking of funky smells,

176
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:24,800
should we start this
investigation

177
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,067
at the urinalysis lab?

178
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,403
Hmm? Take a trip
to the old pee factory?

179
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:29,604
Jake, you're suspended.

180
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:31,439
Just go home, have a beer,
and smash something.

181
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,574
That's what I'd do.

182
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:34,042
Or take advantage
of this amazing city.

183
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,210
Go sightseeing.

184
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,645
MoMA has an exhibit
I'm dying to see.

185
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:38,146
It's all about
office chair design.

186
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:39,648
Oh!

187
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,817
Look, I know technically
I'm not supposed to help out,

188
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:43,517
but rules are made to be broken.

189
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:44,719
They were made to be followed.

190
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,821
Nothing is made to be broken.

191
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:46,822
Uh, piñatas.

192
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,222
- Glow sticks.
- Karate boards.

193
00:05:48,257 --> 00:05:49,691
Spaghetti when you
have a small pot.

194
00:05:49,692 --> 00:05:50,792
Rules.

195
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:52,227
Look, someone's messing
with my life here.

196
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:53,261
I thought you guys had my back.

197
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,529
We do.

198
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,164
But seriously,
you can't come with us.

199
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,499
Okay.

200
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,267
Fine.
I get it.

201
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:01,136
Protocol's protocol.

202
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:03,305
I'm gonna go check out
that office chair design exhibit

203
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:04,305
at the MoMA.

204
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:08,538
Rosa? Amy?

205
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:09,990
What are you guys doing here?

206
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:11,458
Our non-suspended jobs.

207
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,127
You're not supposed
to be investigating.

208
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:14,461
I'm not, I'm sightseeing,

209
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:15,896
just as Amy suggested.

210
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,296
At Brooklyn Urine and Blood?

211
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,699
Oh, yeah, the internet says

212
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,234
this is the number-one
urinalysis lab

213
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:21,335
in all of New York.

214
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:22,703
Fun tourist selfie!

215
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:24,538
Boink!
Not your best.

216
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,874
Anyways, I'm gonna take
a "walking tour" in here

217
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,542
while you guys ask
a couple of questions,

218
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,244
and also, I've been
waiting for 20 minutes.

219
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:31,445
Where have you been?

220
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:32,813
We had to find the addresses
of all 78 people

221
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:33,813
you said might want to hurt you.

222
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:35,015
Uh-huh.

223
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,858
And was there another
stop along the way?

224
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:37,885
We got coffee.

225
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,186
Those are cappuccinos.

226
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:40,888
You know how long it takes
to foam that milk?

227
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,389
Time you could have
spent on my case,

228
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,699
but I guess it's just froth
over friends with you two.

229
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:46,326
Anyways, let's do this.

230
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,428
Jake...

231
00:06:47,429 --> 00:06:48,929
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

232
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,598
I really wish you could come
look at urine with us,

233
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,766
but you can't.

234
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,334
You're suspended.
Go home.

235
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:55,335
All right, fine.

236
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:56,437
If you guys won't help me,

237
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:58,939
I guess I'll just
get myself off.

238
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,973
Context.

239
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,340
Context was
important on that one.

240
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:02,376
I get Greek yogurt,

241
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:03,610
'cause there's heritage there,

242
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:05,012
but Iceland?

243
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:07,848
No, no, no, no, no!

244
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,483
Hey, Gina!

245
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:11,652
What are you guys talking about?
Yogurt? Me too.

246
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:12,886
Let's keep talking about that.

247
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:13,987
Whoo!

248
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:15,089
Terry's out of breath.

249
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,440
Cool. I was just
dropping off some files.

250
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:19,026
Great, let's just
go out to your desk

251
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:20,827
and let's talk
about how that went.

252
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:22,229
Okay, Terry.

253
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,864
But first, I want
to ask the captain

254
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:26,066
for his impresh of my show.

255
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:29,118
Got any feed-b, or was it just
love, love, love?

256
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,771
Well, actually...

257
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:32,639
I thought it was amazing!

258
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,275
You were like a swan
who went to Juilliard.

259
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:37,478
It was so good.

260
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,047
Terry, I have already
received your praise.

261
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:42,423
I'm clearly fishing
in another pond right now.

262
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,800
I'm putting an end to this.

263
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:44,952
Sergeant Jeffords and I

264
00:07:44,953 --> 00:07:48,222
were unable to attend
your performance.

265
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,923
Oh.

266
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:52,024
But you were so spot on
with your compliments.

267
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,893
Terry is a practiced liar.

268
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:55,770
I'm sorry we missed the show.

269
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:58,532
I know that dancing is
an important hobby to you.

270
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,833
Hobby?

271
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,275
You think my dancing is a hobby?

272
00:08:01,302 --> 00:08:02,402
Oh, yes.

273
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:04,471
Like me and antique
globe collecting.

274
00:08:04,472 --> 00:08:07,541
It's thrilling, but nobody is
ever going to pay me for it.

275
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:08,574
Ergo, a hobby.

276
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,910
I get paid...

277
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:11,612
in applause.

278
00:08:11,613 --> 00:08:13,371
But apparently not yours.

279
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,835
I know that maintaining
integrity can be difficult,

280
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:20,287
but in the long run,

281
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:22,156
everyone is better for it.

282
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,794
Attention everyone.

283
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:30,430
The tragic sound you hear
is the shredding of my spandie.

284
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:32,999
Gina Linetti
will never dance again.

285
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,503
So those threatening phone calls

286
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,373
were being made to Tim Orsk

287
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:40,773
of Tim O's Limos.

288
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,075
That's interesting.

289
00:08:42,076 --> 00:08:44,577
This Orsk guy's name keeps
cropping up in this case.

290
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:46,180
'Cause he's the victim.

291
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:47,815
You know, he's
the guy whose window

292
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:50,184
was smashed with this rock.

293
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:51,185
Okay?

294
00:08:51,186 --> 00:08:52,869
He's being extorted for $10,000.

295
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,163
Sure, but what do
they want from him?

296
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,623
$10,000.

297
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:58,158
I just said that.

298
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,960
We're trying to figure out
who's doing the threatening.

299
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:03,263
Wait.
I have a theory.

300
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:05,766
I think "limousine"
and "magazine"

301
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:07,099
come from the same word.

302
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:08,502
Just focus!

303
00:09:08,503 --> 00:09:09,937
I'm sorry for snapping.

304
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:10,937
I interviewed Orsk...

305
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:12,339
Orsk!
There it is again.

306
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,740
Oh, you're useless!

307
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,142
You're completely useless!

308
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:17,377
You are without a doubt
the most incompetent detectives

309
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:18,779
I've ever seen.

310
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,647
And I'm including
that bomb-sniffing dog

311
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:21,939
who humps all the bombs!

312
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:26,553
You know your turning
signal's been on for 30 seconds.

313
00:09:26,554 --> 00:09:28,487
I like to announce
my turning intention.

314
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,031
This isn't the Indy 500.

315
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,492
Well, when you finally change
lanes an hour from now,

316
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:33,894
we should go talk
to Jake's super...

317
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:35,094
see if there was a power outage.

318
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,463
What?

319
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:37,598
Oh!

320
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:38,915
Why would you do that?

321
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:39,967
I just broke into your car

322
00:09:39,968 --> 00:09:41,501
and then
popped up without warning.

323
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:42,585
Not cool.

324
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:43,803
What the hell are you doing?

325
00:09:43,838 --> 00:09:45,739
I thought I was hitching
a ride to Rikers

326
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,574
so we could interview
some convicts I put away,

327
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:49,976
but apparently you're still
wasting time investigating me.

328
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:52,846
Hey, it's your fault we have to
check up on your power outages.

329
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:55,181
You have three mini-fridges
plugged in to the same outlet.

330
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:57,433
Three mini-fridges are cheaper
than one regular one.

331
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:58,785
We're just doing our jobs.

332
00:09:58,786 --> 00:09:59,786
Why don't you trust us?

333
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:00,787
How can I?

334
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:01,889
You didn't even know a man

335
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,590
was lying
in the backseat of your car.

336
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:05,392
And while you two
were busy lolly-gargling...

337
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:06,960
I'm not familiar
with the expression...

338
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:09,329
I was investigating.
I'll send you some selfies.

339
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,731
Look, we're gonna
get to your list.

340
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:12,499
We just have to rule out
other possibilities first.

341
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,867
You know, there is a real chance

342
00:10:13,868 --> 00:10:15,368
that no one is after you.

343
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:16,904
Yeah, but I'm telling you
that someone is.

344
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:17,870
That should be enough.

345
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,506
And we told you to trust us.

346
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:20,539
That should be enough.

347
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:21,842
All right, fine.
You don't want my help?

348
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:22,808
You're not gonna get it.

349
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:24,978
Dude...

350
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:27,588
In fact, I'm deleting
your numbers from my phone.

351
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:28,756
Just let us take you home.

352
00:10:28,783 --> 00:10:30,250
See you never.

353
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:31,384
Fine.

354
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:36,657
Where am I?

355
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,466
Hello, Peralta.

356
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:51,760
Geoffrey Hoytsman?

357
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,361
You're the one
who's been sabotaging me?

358
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,431
I'm just ruining your life
like you ruined mine.

359
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:57,932
You never should
have arrested me.

360
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,968
But I basically got
your cocaine charges dropped.

361
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:02,136
You only had to do 40 hours
of community service.

362
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,773
Right, but I wanted to
get them all done at once,

363
00:11:04,774 --> 00:11:07,809
so for energy, I did way too
much cocaine and meth.

364
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,010
Went on a prolonged
psychotic episode

365
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,080
involving assault,
public fornication,

366
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:14,015
and, apparently,
the touching of my scrotum

367
00:11:14,016 --> 00:11:15,951
to every doorknob
in a synagogue.

368
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,151
And you know what happened then?

369
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:18,453
They thoroughly cleaned
the synagogue,

370
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:19,654
you landed on your feet

371
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:21,389
and pursued your true passion
of selling ice cream?

372
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,591
None of that.

373
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:25,360
I lost my job
and my wife and my home.

374
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:26,862
An ex-client lent me this truck.

375
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,096
He likes me
because I got him off

376
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:29,296
on a strangle-and-mangle.

377
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:30,865
You have a phrase for that?

378
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,268
I used to, when I was
an awesome lawyer.

379
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,569
Now I'm just another idiot
living in an ice cream truck.

380
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,571
So that's why you put
drugs in my urine.

381
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:39,541
Hey, that was my urine.

382
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,175
Your urine is in there.

383
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,643
Why would you keep my pee?

384
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:44,346
I need belongings, Jake,

385
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:45,447
to feel like a man.

386
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:47,348
Look, this is a bad idea,
Hoytsman.

387
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:49,550
People are gonna notice
if I disappear.

388
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,553
See? Someone's already
looking for me.

389
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:53,722
You're in big trouble, buddy.

390
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:57,158
Your e-coupon for Big Mike's
Calzones expires today.

391
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:58,293
You're damn right.

392
00:11:58,294 --> 00:11:59,728
And if I don't redeem that,

393
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:02,062
Big Mike is gonna get
real suspicious.

394
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,632
Big Mike is a cartoon

395
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,567
with pizzas for eyes.

396
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:06,934
All right, fine.

397
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:09,069
Maybe not Big Mike,
but someone will.

398
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,771
Shut up, Peralta!

399
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:12,173
Oh, boy.

400
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,142
Captain Holt,

401
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:16,912
here's your CompStat report.

402
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,647
This is how I move now.

403
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:20,448
Walking is too close to dancing,

404
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,084
and there's no more dance in me.

405
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,687
Plus I'm hoping my leg
muscles will atrophy

406
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:27,922
so I won't be
tempted to use them.

407
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:36,564
I bet you feel real good about
calling her dancing hobby, huh?

408
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,066
Sarcasm...
the coward's lie.

409
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:40,234
I don't get it.

410
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:41,903
Gina's always
so sure of herself.

411
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:43,104
She usually doesn't care at all

412
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,471
what people say
or think about her.

413
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:46,775
Maybe not with
most people, Captain.

414
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:48,210
But she cares what you think.

415
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,848
Fine.
I regret what I said.

416
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:55,282
But now, I don't know how
to make it right with her.

417
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:56,685
Lie!

418
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:58,687
Look, yesterday I told my twins

419
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:00,488
there were baby bunnies
in their stomachs

420
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,922
to get them to eat lettuce.

421
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,225
And that worked?

422
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:05,493
Yeah, but then they refused
to drink their milk

423
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,362
because they thought
the bunnies would drown.

424
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:10,098
So I bought a couple rabbits
and told the girls

425
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:12,333
that they hopped out of
their mouths while they slept.

426
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,567
I've lost track of your point.

427
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:14,703
They ate their lettuce,

428
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:15,837
I'm stuck with two bunnies,

429
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,404
and lying works!

430
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:25,447
Pretty good gag, huh?

431
00:13:25,448 --> 00:13:27,115
A prostitute taught me
how to make it.

432
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,617
Ugh.
Where were you?

433
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:30,185
You were gone for three hours.

434
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:33,020
I know because I sang "This Is
How We Do It" 143 times.

435
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,690
Okay, well, I had to grab a few
things at the art supply store.

436
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,759
Kidnapping is 90% crafting.

437
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,228
Jake, you're gonna help me
get my life back.

438
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:41,830
You're gonna confess, on video,

439
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,032
to framing me for everything
that got me in trouble.

440
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,466
And why would I do that?

441
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:46,835
Because I'm high on bath salts,

442
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:47,869
emotionally unstable,

443
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,169
and pointing a gun at you.

444
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,604
Let's make a movie!

445
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:53,108
Hey, Boyle,

446
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:55,009
guess who caught
the Tim O's Limos perp.

447
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,678
Jake?

448
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,679
Is Jake back?

449
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
No, we did.

450
00:13:58,681 --> 00:13:59,848
Scully and Hitchcock.

451
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:01,783
Signed confession.

452
00:14:01,784 --> 00:14:02,784
You called us useless.

453
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:04,319
You called us incompetent.

454
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,819
You called us zeros in the sack.

455
00:14:05,855 --> 00:14:06,987
Never happened.

456
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:09,190
Well, someone said it
to me last night.

457
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,559
Oh, uh, must have been my wife.

458
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,993
How did you solve the case?

459
00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:14,562
We listened to those
voicemails again

460
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,598
and noticed the sound
of parrots in the background.

461
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:18,400
Got a list of employees,
did door duty

462
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:20,567
asking neighbors
if any of them kept pet birds.

463
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:23,571
We finally found
one who did, and guess what.

464
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,540
The landscaping in front of his
building was covered with these.

465
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,244
Same type of rock that
was thrown through the window.

466
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:30,345
I can't believe it.

467
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:31,813
What, you don't think
it could break one?

468
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:32,813
Watch.

469
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,850
I meant I can't believe
you solved the case.

470
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:38,285
Well, you were
wrong on that too.

471
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,392
Hi.
My name is Jake Peralta,

472
00:14:44,393 --> 00:14:45,859
and this is my confession.

473
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:48,395
I destroyed the good name
of an American hero...

474
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,630
Geoffrey Hoytsman.

475
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:53,868
I framed him
for drug possession,

476
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:55,203
I got him fired from his job,

477
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,838
and I planted his scrotal prints

478
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,772
on the synagogue doorknobs.

479
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:01,009
Great, now just eighty more
confessions to go.

480
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,177
You've been very naughty.

481
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:06,081
I threatened to blow
Mr. Hoytsman's head off

482
00:15:06,082 --> 00:15:07,849
if he didn't quote-unquote

483
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,417
"really cheap out
on his dad's funeral."

484
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:12,420
And while he slept,

485
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:14,255
I logged in to
Hoytsman's computer

486
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:16,658
and flooded it with Thai
pornography.

487
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:17,725
Starts crying.

488
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,494
"Starts crying"
is a stage direction,

489
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,029
you imbecile!

490
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,199
Also, I fathered two children
with Hoytsman's cleaning lady,

491
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,967
and it was I,
disguised as Geoffrey,

492
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,702
who spoke against her
at her political asylum hearing.

493
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:29,803
God.

494
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,183
You did it, not me.

495
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:35,310
I am a horrible person
who has done horrible things

496
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:37,111
to a truly decent man,

497
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:40,949
which is why I've decided
to take my own life.

498
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,383
Wait, no, I didn't decide that.

499
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:43,617
Spoiler alert!

500
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,775
Decided to take my own life.

501
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:49,543
That last take sounded great.

502
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:51,845
You really brought
my words to life.

503
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:53,347
You know, I should write more.

504
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:54,348
What a rush!

505
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:56,316
Hoytsman, you don't
have to do this.

506
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:57,551
Your life's not so bad.

507
00:15:57,552 --> 00:15:59,553
Living in an ice cream truck?
Never showering?

508
00:15:59,554 --> 00:16:01,021
That was my childhood dream.

509
00:16:01,022 --> 00:16:02,423
I had everything.

510
00:16:02,424 --> 00:16:06,026
I had friends, a wife,
two beautiful children...

511
00:16:06,027 --> 00:16:07,127
out of three total.

512
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:08,262
Not a bad ratio.

513
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,430
And now I have nothing

514
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:10,431
and no one.

515
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:11,532
Look, I get it.

516
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,000
I know what that feels like.

517
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,836
You've only lived in an ice
cream truck for part of one day!

518
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,438
How could you possibly know?

519
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,573
Well, I know no one's
coming to rescue me.

520
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:21,875
I was so concerned with saving
myself and my reputation

521
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:23,209
I pushed all my friends away.

522
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:25,846
Wow.

523
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:27,915
Sounds like you're
having a breakthrough.

524
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,215
You should act on this.

525
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,752
You still have time
to make it right.

526
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:33,220
Really?
You're not gonna kill me?

527
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:34,321
Oh, jeez.

528
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:35,689
I totally forgot.

529
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,825
Thanks for reminding me.
Of course I'm gonna kill you.

530
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,327
Drugs make me say
such silly things.

531
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:41,829
Drugs are so silly.

532
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,032
Ooh, I'm gonna do some
right now.

533
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,033
- Hoytsman.
- What?

534
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:47,034
- Hyah!
- Oh!

535
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:49,036
God!
That's my nose!

536
00:16:49,037 --> 00:16:50,470
That's where I put the drugs in!

537
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,573
- Gyah!
- Oh!

538
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,210
So long, Hoytsman.

539
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:58,144
Hyah!

540
00:16:58,179 --> 00:16:59,246
I can't move!

541
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:01,682
I'm turtling.
I'm turtling!

542
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:03,650
Nice try, Jake.

543
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:04,685
Get up!

544
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:05,818
I can't.

545
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,321
Oh.

546
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:08,588
Yeah. Okay.
My bad.

547
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:11,859
What's this?

548
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,829
I'm selling my smoke machine,
glitter cannon, and castanets.

549
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,197
I would've put my soul on there,

550
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:19,967
but that was shredded
along with my spandies.

551
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,702
Gina, I want to
tell you something.

552
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:24,438
Dancing is more than just
a hobby for you.

553
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:25,773
It's a profession.

554
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,674
Oh, so you're a liar
like Terry now?

555
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:29,977
No, I'm no bunny-buying coward.

556
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:31,912
You are a professional dancer,

557
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:34,348
because I'm paying Dancy Reagan

558
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:37,851
to perform two shows at
our at-risk youth program.

559
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:39,019
Congratulations.

560
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,189
Thank you, Captain.

561
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,957
You just made me
the happiest, prettiest,

562
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,492
most talented girl in the world.

563
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:47,828
This is the best $8,000
you ever spent.

564
00:17:47,829 --> 00:17:49,262
It's $200.

565
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:51,364
I'm sure you're
good for the rest.

566
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:53,599
Captain loves my dancing.

567
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:02,276
This is why you're alone, Jake.

568
00:18:02,277 --> 00:18:03,644
We were bonding,

569
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:04,678
talking about our pain,

570
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:06,547
and you pull a stunt like that?

571
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:07,681
You were gonna kill me.

572
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,316
Deflect, deflect, deflect.

573
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:11,785
This is why everyone hates you.

574
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:12,986
You open?

575
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:14,988
Okay.
You keep it shut.

576
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:16,522
I really need this sale.

577
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:21,460
Hello, ma...
whoa!

578
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:23,564
Don't hurt me!

579
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,532
I'm someone's little boy.

580
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,234
Geoffrey Hoytsman,
you're under arrest.

581
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,368
Ow.

582
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,872
Oh, I am so relieved
you guys found me.

583
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:33,072
Wait, how did you find me?

584
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:34,641
You hadn't done anything
super annoying to us

585
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:35,642
for, like, five hours,

586
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:36,844
so we knew something was wrong.

587
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:38,212
Oh, that's very insulting

588
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:39,646
but dead on.

589
00:18:39,647 --> 00:18:41,949
We looked through those
irritating selfies you sent us,

590
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,417
and in the background
of three of them

591
00:18:43,418 --> 00:18:44,518
was an ice cream truck.

592
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:46,420
We ran the plates
and put out an APB.

593
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:48,355
I'm sorry we doubted
anybody was sabotaging you.

594
00:18:48,356 --> 00:18:49,957
No, I'm the one
who should apologize.

595
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,625
For some reason,
I have trouble believing

596
00:18:51,626 --> 00:18:52,826
people actually have my back.

597
00:18:52,827 --> 00:18:54,127
I don't know why.

598
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,563
Probably my dad abandoning me.

599
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:58,899
Maybe something I should work
out in therapy, but...

600
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,536
who has an hour to spare
once every two weeks, right?

601
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:03,537
Anyways,

602
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,104
I'm sorry I acted
like a jackass.

603
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:07,407
Wow, Jake, you're so sincere
since you got off coke.

604
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:09,276
And meth.
That was the hard one to kick.

605
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:11,478
No, the hard one to kick
is angel dust,

606
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:13,947
which is why I am
locked in for life.

607
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,150
Hey.

608
00:19:17,151 --> 00:19:18,385
I double checked your evidence.

609
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:19,386
Everything looks good.

610
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:21,488
I got to say...

611
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:22,923
you guys are good cops.

612
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:24,791
Hyeah, no doy!

613
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,760
How do you think we got to be
the oldest guys here?

614
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:27,861
By never being promoted

615
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,563
and losing all
your money to divorces?

616
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:30,931
And bad investments.

617
00:19:30,932 --> 00:19:33,333
Anyway, I'm sorry
for calling you useless.

618
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,235
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows you did good.

619
00:19:35,236 --> 00:19:36,470
- Boyle, please don't.
- Don't?

620
00:19:36,471 --> 00:19:37,871
The last thing we need

621
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,439
is to suddenly be
on everyone's A list.

622
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,474
The ones to watch.

623
00:19:40,475 --> 00:19:41,475
The golden boys.

624
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:42,842
Pair of red hot dicks.

625
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,411
No one calls detectives
that anymore.

626
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:45,746
People call detectives that?

627
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:47,981
All that
investigating was exhausting.

628
00:19:47,982 --> 00:19:50,250
Besides, we did our share
of that in the '70s and '80s.

629
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:53,153
Now we like to do paperwork
in our comfy chairs.

630
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:54,788
If we're away from
our desks for too long,

631
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:58,325
they'll update our computers,
and we'll lose Minesweeper.

632
00:19:58,326 --> 00:19:59,960
So please, don't tell anyone

633
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:01,962
about the amazing work
we did today.

634
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,530
I never said "amazing."

635
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:05,432
You kind of just did your jobs.

636
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:07,267
There you go.

637
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:08,268
No, really.

638
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:09,502
I mean, you also broke a window.

639
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:10,770
Now you get it.

640
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:16,476
Your suspension
has been lifted, Peralta.

641
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:17,978
Well, that's great news, sir.

642
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,713
And now it is time
for the traditional

643
00:20:19,714 --> 00:20:21,048
handing back of gun and badge

644
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:22,449
to the vindicated hero ceremony.

645
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,617
Everyone in!

646
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:25,251
I don't have your gun
or your badge.

647
00:20:25,286 --> 00:20:28,755
Just take form 891-underscore-J
down to the equipment room

648
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:30,324
and retrieve your things there.

649
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:32,059
I'm sorry,
but that's unacceptable.

650
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,260
Come on, Captain.
I need this.

651
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:34,261
We all need this!

652
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,198
Fine. Fine.

653
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,032
If this will make you happy...

654
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:44,705
I believe these belong to you.

655
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:45,872
Congratulations.

656
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:49,810
That's very nice.
Thank you.

657
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:52,045
But as I've said before,
the system stinks,

658
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,313
and this isn't over.

659
00:20:53,314 --> 00:20:55,649
I say we march down
to city hall!

660
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,050
Get out of my office.

661
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,051
Yup.
