1
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,349
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,508
Rosa's wearing pink!
Rosa's wearing pink!

3
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,286
Are we sure it's not a white shirt that's
just been bloodied in a motorcycle crash?

4
00:00:18,287 --> 00:00:20,451
Maybe it wasn't her.
Does she have a twin sister?

5
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:22,120
If Rosa had a twin,

6
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,888
she would have eaten her
in the womb.

7
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:25,456
Wait. Hold it. Stop.

8
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:27,025
How come none of you
teased her about it?

9
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,726
It's Rosa.
She's scary.

10
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,428
You guys are unbelievable.

11
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,463
I once wore a tie
with a splash of purple.

12
00:00:32,464 --> 00:00:34,532
You guys called me Mr. Grapes
for two years.

13
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:36,701
Oh, Mr. Grapes.

14
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,403
I forgot about Mr. Grapes.

15
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:40,905
If I wore a pink shirt,
you'd tear me to shreds.

16
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:43,675
Well, yeah, but you'd look like
a My Little Pony with a gun.

17
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:44,909
Let me guess.

18
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:46,778
Your theater club
is putting on Grease,

19
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,246
and you're playing
a pink lady.

20
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:50,915
What are you guys
laughing at?

21
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,417
If Boyle was wearing
a pink shirt.

22
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,918
I get it.
That's hilarious.

23
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:54,919
What's happening?

24
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,688
Rosa is the one wearing pink.

25
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:59,190
And?

26
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:00,391
It's gorgeous.

27
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:01,759
I wish I could pull that off

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,094
Dream on,
Strawberry Shortcake.

29
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:05,096
Yeah, nice try, Mr. Grapes.

30
00:01:05,097 --> 00:01:07,965
Mr. Grapes.

31
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,934
Mr. Grapes!

32
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:32,190
Last night, several masked men
robbed a number

33
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,225
of check cashing locations
in our precinct.

34
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,327
They also hit several locations
in the Nine-Three,

35
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,329
so this will be
a joint investigation.

36
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,798
Detective David Majors
is already on the case.

37
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,867
Whoa, Dave Majors?

38
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:43,867
Seriously?

39
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:45,370
Who's that?

40
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,839
He's The best detective in
the NYPD, myself included.

41
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,974
His arrest numbers
are staggering.

42
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:52,343
His conviction rate
is magnificent.

43
00:01:52,344 --> 00:01:54,479
He is blotter dynamite.

44
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:55,980
I mean, I'm cool.

45
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,382
I'm just hanging out
with you guys.

46
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,517
Okay, but what's his body like

47
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:01,552
on a scale from Charles
to Terry?

48
00:02:01,587 --> 00:02:02,954
Sorry, buddy.

49
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:03,988
What?

50
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:05,390
I'm the ten.

51
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,391
Sure you are.

52
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,326
Majors does just fine.

53
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,728
His girlfriend is the weather
lady from channel five.

54
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,997
You know, the one who's always
reaching for Cooperstown?

55
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,365
Love her.

56
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:15,733
Well, I need someone
to partner up with him.

57
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,302
- Ooh, me, me, me, me, me.
- Oh, I'll do it.

58
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,736
Sir, with all due respect,
I'm the obvious choice.

59
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,539
I mean, look at me.
I'm not in profile.

60
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,007
Sir, please let the record show

61
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,109
that the sauce on his face
is from yesterday.

62
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,544
And it is that level
of eagle-eyed observation

63
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:27,779
that I plan to bring to...

64
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,981
Enough.
You can both work the case.

65
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,649
Three heads are better
than two.

66
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,151
Also,
I fear any other decision I make

67
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,319
will just result
in further noise.

68
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,486
Good call, sir.

69
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:37,322
I was about to start chanting,
"Vote for Jake."

70
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,523
Let's do it anyway.

71
00:02:38,524 --> 00:02:40,525
Vote for Jake.
Vote for Jake.

72
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:43,027
- Dismissed.
- Yeah.

73
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,262
Code Chartreuse.

74
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:45,763
I repeat, Code Chartreuse.

75
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:46,798
Gina, for the last time,

76
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,533
please limit your alerts
to ROY-G-BIV.

77
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:49,701
Disappointing.

78
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,302
"Code Chartreuse" means
"the recruiter

79
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:53,504
from Copperhead Security,
Gary Shaw, is here."

80
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,707
Gary Shaw has attempted
to pry me away

81
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,842
from the NYPD for eight years.

82
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:00,712
When he makes his offer,
I know just what I'll say:

83
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:04,215
Never is not just a crater
on Mars.

84
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:05,569
Of course,
it is a crater on Mars.

85
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:06,684
That's hilarious.

86
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:08,019
It's not meant to be funny,
Boyle.

87
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,520
It's meant to be devastating.

88
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,823
Captain Holt,
good to see you.

89
00:03:11,857 --> 00:03:14,826
Mr. Shaw,
let's just cut to the chase:

90
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,729
Never is not just a crater
on Mars.

91
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,201
Of course,
it is a crater on Mars.

92
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,003
Well, actually,
I'm not here for you.

93
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,071
A member of your squad
reached out to me,

94
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,906
a Sergeant Terry Jeffords.

95
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,009
Oh.

96
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,076
Oh, I see.

97
00:03:32,077 --> 00:03:35,179
Well,
Sergeant Jeffords is out there.

98
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,414
Thank you, Captain.

99
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,450
There's my guy
Terry the tank.

100
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,487
What? Guys. What? Guys.

101
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,422
Terry called him?
He's shaking Terry's hand.

102
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:46,624
Now I'm just describing
everything that's happening?

103
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,926
What the hell is going on?

104
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,160
I do not know.

105
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,396
And now Captain Holt
doesn't know.

106
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,306
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

107
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,007
Oh, Majors isn't here yet?

108
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,543
I wasted all that coolness
on a bunch of nobodies.

109
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,744
I'm just gonna reset.

110
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:11,616
Jake, he's a
highly decorated detective.

111
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:14,118
He's not gonna be impressed
by your sunglass choreography.

112
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,288
He's gonna be too distracted
by my notebook flip.

113
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,991
Shut up. Shut up.
He's here.

114
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:21,492
Hey,
you must be the Nine-Nine.

115
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:22,860
- I'm Majors.
- Hey. Peralta.

116
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,229
This is Santiago.

117
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,932
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

118
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,034
You mean here in my notebook?

119
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,136
I looked into the baby masks
the perps were wearing,

120
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,239
and no stores
in the tri-state area sell them.

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,374
Reminds me of a murder I worked
a few years back.

122
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:37,909
Perp always wore
these weird masks

123
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:39,663
We couldn't figure out
where he bought them.

124
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:41,145
Turns out he was making
his own masks

125
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:42,880
from human skin.

126
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,415
No.

127
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,050
That is so awesome.

128
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:47,919
Really, Amy?
For whom?

129
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,420
Sounds to me like those
face masks

130
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:52,223
were once somebody's face...
faces.

131
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,458
That's true, Peralta.

132
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,859
I think about that every day.

133
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,595
You and me both.
Ahh.

134
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,465
Okay, I'm gonna look around,
take a few statements.

135
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,499
Juicy. Juicy.

136
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,034
- Good call. Good call.
- Yep, yep, yep.

137
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,435
Tight, tight, tight,
tight, tight.

138
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,938
Well, looks like round one
goes to Peralta.

139
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,706
And don't worry;
I'm just getting warmed up.

140
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,074
I still have eight
sunglass moves

141
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:11,109
locked and loaded.

142
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:13,845
Make that nine.

143
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,680
A-whee.

144
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,656
So how was lunch?

145
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,823
It was good.

146
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,292
I had the T-bone with...

147
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,726
I don't give a crap
about the food.

148
00:05:28,727 --> 00:05:30,261
Just email me
about that later.

149
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:31,262
What happened with Gary?

150
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,097
He gave me the hard sell.

151
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:36,000
Look at all this swag I got:

152
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:38,403
Puffy vest, carabiner...

153
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,737
Terry, carabiners suck.

154
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,339
You want free stuff?

155
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,740
Here you go.
All right?

156
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:44,275
You can have anything
you want from Amy's desk.

157
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:45,276
Yeah.

158
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:47,645
Gary made me an offer:

159
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:51,449
Better hours, great benefits,
a serious pay raise,

160
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,985
my own office...
with walls.

161
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,054
Did you tell him Terry
doesn't love walls?

162
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,722
No, Terry loves walls.

163
00:05:57,756 --> 00:06:00,124
I'm seriously considering
saying yes

164
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,026
Look, I have another kid
on the way.

165
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,995
Do you know how much
diapers cost?

166
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:06,064
Yes.

167
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,168
The point is,

168
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,670
I'm trying to do what's best
for my family.

169
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:14,672
- It's not just about me.
- Exactly.

170
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:19,277
It's about me and how you are
abandoning me to these squares.

171
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,713
Yikes.

172
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,414
Look at all these baby masks.

173
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:25,717
Looks like someone's due
for a spanking from Papa Law.

174
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,985
Nice.

175
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,087
So the van was stolen
from a rental lot

176
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,056
three weeks ago
and dumped here yesterday.

177
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:35,527
Talk about
a curbside drop-off.

178
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,329
We're working a case here, Amy.
It's not Showtime at the Apollo.

179
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,665
Great point.
Thank you so much, Jake.

180
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,202
Well, I'm going to go sign
the van over to forensics.

181
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,673
Hey, listen, I'm a member
of this invite-only speakeasy

182
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:49,707
called The Keychain.

183
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,075
Want to get
a drink there later?

184
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:53,311
I'd ask Amy also,
but I can only bring one guest.

185
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,580
Nah, it's cool; I'm sure
she's busy tonight anyway.

186
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,048
Taxes are due
in eight months.

187
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:58,616
Actually, they were due
two weeks ago.

188
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:01,319
Well,
that is a horrible surprise.

189
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,389
But the point is,
drink sounds good.

190
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,066
Password?

191
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,634
Tropical.

192
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,143
Oh, my gah.

193
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,278
This place is amazing.

194
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,681
Yeah, I come here
after ever case I solve,

195
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,915
which means I'm here a lot.

196
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,383
Oh, nice.

197
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:33,885
Every time I solve one,
I go get a steak dinner.

198
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,520
My cholesterol is uh-terrible.

199
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,522
Milo,
this is my friend Jake.

200
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,823
We're working a case together.

201
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:40,625
Yeah, and this is
my friend Dave.

202
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,193
We're friends.
I'll have a...

203
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:43,528
Oh no.
You don't order here.

204
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,930
Milo makes you a drink
he knows you'll love,

205
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,065
and then you love it.

206
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,433
Really?
Interesting.

207
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:52,070
Barrel Proof bourbon, neat
orange stood a chaser.

208
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,605
Well, to the first
of many hangs.

209
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,039
Yeah, totally.

210
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,408
Listen, the reason
I brought you here is,

211
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,044
I want to ask you,
what's the deal with Santiago?

212
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,279
Amy?
Oh, no.

213
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,414
Did she do something weird?

214
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,982
No, no, she's great.

215
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,717
I just want to know if there's
something going on with you two.

216
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,051
You know, are you together...

217
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,887
Oh, no, no.

218
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,422
Cool, when this case is over,

219
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,423
I'm gonna ask her out.

220
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,258
Oh.

221
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,194
You're gonna ask out Amy
when the case ends.

222
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,229
Perfect.

223
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,798
Oh.

224
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,065
Yeah,
that's a sippin' whiskey.

225
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,343
So it is.

226
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:35,411
Seems about right.

227
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:36,779
What's wrong with you?

228
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,383
You and Majors have too much fun
last night at "The Keychain?"

229
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,885
Okay, it's a private bar,
not a haunted motel.

230
00:08:42,886 --> 00:08:44,954
And no,
I did not have a good time.

231
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:46,756
Turns out he didn't want
to be best bros at all.

232
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:48,424
He just wanted to know
if I was cool with him

233
00:08:48,425 --> 00:08:49,826
asking Amy out
when the case ended.

234
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,227
I thought he was dating
that weather girl.

235
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:52,428
No, he dumped her because she
blamed Hurricane Sandy

236
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:53,796
on gay marriage.

237
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:55,098
Anyways,
now when the case ends,

238
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,533
Amy is gonna marry
Detective "Blotter Dynamite."

239
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:58,601
Why do you even care?

240
00:08:58,602 --> 00:08:59,969
You still like her?

241
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,105
I don't know.
I mean, we're friends.

242
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:04,273
And things have been
kind of flirty lately.

243
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,476
Plus, we had this weird
romantic moment thing-y

244
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:08,111
at Charles and Gina's
parents' wedding.

245
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:09,846
Ugh, just say you still like her.

246
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:11,581
All right, fine,
I still like her.

247
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:13,249
Look, I've been thinking
about asking her out

248
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,751
for the last couple of weeks,
but it's hard.

249
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:16,519
There's so much buildup now,
you know?

250
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,653
Not really.
I don't ask people out.

251
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:19,055
I just tell them
where we're going.

252
00:09:19,056 --> 00:09:20,757
Great, well,
it doesn't matter now anyway,

253
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:21,958
'cause I told Dave
to go for it.

254
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:22,959
That was crazy stupid.

255
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,994
Sorry.
That was normal stupid.

256
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,429
You should have told him
to back off.

257
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,264
I can't go around telling guys
not to ask Amy out

258
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:30,533
because I like her and I'm too
dumb to do anything about it.

259
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,001
I can't make
a woman's choice for her.

260
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:33,703
I stand with Wendy.
Did I do that right?

261
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:34,771
- No.
- Oh.

262
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:36,673
Look, If you want to give her
a real choice,

263
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:40,309
you've got to let her know
that you are an option.

264
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,778
I think you know
what you've got to do.

265
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,112
Yeah.

266
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:44,681
Ask her out before
the case ends, right?

267
00:09:44,682 --> 00:09:46,115
I just want to be
extra clear.

268
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:48,451
The stakes are through
the roof for me on this one.

269
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:52,388
You wanted to see us?

270
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:54,157
What are these
requisition forms?

271
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:57,393
We are throwing Terry
a "please stay" party.

272
00:09:57,394 --> 00:10:01,097
My vision is a frozen yogurt
machine operated by Pam Grier.

273
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:04,734
Sir, we think Sarge is going
to accept Copperhead's offer.

274
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:06,269
I never thought
I'd say these words:

275
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,571
You have to put Gina in touch
with Pam Grier.

276
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:10,506
No, Sergeant Jeffords
can make up his mind

277
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:13,242
without the influence
of Foxy Brown or cold yogurt.

278
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,344
He is a grown man.

279
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,612
Oh,
I see what's going on here

280
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,548
You're upset that Terry
would even consider

281
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:19,982
leaving the Nine-Nine.

282
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:23,786
I'd expect this pettiness from
a spineless amoeba like Charles,

283
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:24,907
but not you, Sir.

284
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,122
I'm not spineless.

285
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:27,123
Come on, Charles.

286
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:28,124
Yep.

287
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,060
Ahh, look who's finally here.

288
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:32,628
We already solved the case
without you.

289
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:33,997
What?
You did?

290
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:35,298
Kidding.

291
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:36,799
Oliver was actually giving us
some pretty bad news.

292
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,334
Carry on, Oliver.

293
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:39,836
So we swabbed the whole van.

294
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:41,337
We didn't find anything.

295
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,339
No hairs, no fibers, no semen.

296
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,975
And a rental van is usually
a frickin' Jackson Pollock.

297
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,010
All right.

298
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,111
They also wiped
down the masks

299
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,879
with some sort of
bleach solution.

300
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,648
They were really
covering their tracks.

301
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,216
Check it out.

302
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:54,851
Well,
that wasn't very helpful.

303
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:57,387
Although, I did learn I should
never rent a van again.

304
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:59,455
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second privately?

305
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,324
Sure.
Oh, wait.

306
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:03,026
This isn't gonna be that thing
where you pretend you got

307
00:11:03,027 --> 00:11:04,360
an important text from Holt,

308
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:05,862
and it's just that video
of screaming sheep.

309
00:11:05,863 --> 00:11:08,498
I promise you it's not,
but I do stand by that prank.

310
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,402
So what's up?

311
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,439
Okay, I almost feel
weird saying this,

312
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,808
but I wanted to ask you...

313
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:20,510
wow, those pictures
are not helping.

314
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:21,944
Oh, my God.

315
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,713
They're really gonna
have to re-grout.

316
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:25,348
Ugh, finding a contractor.

317
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:26,683
You are so consistent.

318
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:28,685
Anyways, the question I wanted
to ask you is...

319
00:11:28,686 --> 00:11:30,486
So I got the results
on that feces.

320
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:33,589
It's human,
but it's not all human.

321
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,791
You're not Dr. Gassner.

322
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:35,825
We are not.

323
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:36,993
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.

324
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,328
Real quick,
what was the other...

325
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:39,562
Dog and bear.

326
00:11:39,563 --> 00:11:40,863
Wow.

327
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:42,865
I thought you'd really
be into that feces puzzle.

328
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:44,300
Normally, yes.

329
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:46,469
But I want to talk to you
about something else right now.

330
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,770
More specifically...

331
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,772
- Guys, dispatch just called.
- Great, Dave's here now.

332
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:51,474
The check-cashing babies
just struck on Flatbush.

333
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:52,475
We've got to go.

334
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:53,843
Lead the way.

335
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:55,511
What did you want to tell me?

336
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:59,449
Oh, Captain Holt sent
a very important text.

337
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:00,550
Oh.

338
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:10,893
What's that smell?

339
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:13,763
That's lavender.
Terry loves lavender.

340
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:15,932
A little homemade
honey yogurt

341
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:19,068
infused with
lavender and love.

342
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:22,538
Mmm, that is delicious.

343
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,073
Hold it.

344
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:26,476
This isn't some weird breast
milk or something is it, Boyle?

345
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,611
I mean, technically
it's from a sheep's breast.

346
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:30,913
Hey, Terry,
got any new baby pics?

347
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,715
You hate looking at
pictures of my twins.

348
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,150
You said since they
were identical,

349
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,885
I didn't need to take
photos of both.

350
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,787
That doesn't sound
like Auntie Gina.

351
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:39,722
I love your baby pics

352
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:42,659
and your stories about
the twins' sleep schedules.

353
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,495
Okay, I know what
you two are doing.

354
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:47,063
This is your weird way
of trying

355
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,399
to make me stay
at the Nine-Nine.

356
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,901
Well, I am loving it.

357
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:55,572
You know, the funny thing is,
Cagney naps better,

358
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:58,107
but at night,
that's Lacey's time to shine.

359
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,509
One time,
she went 8-to-8.

360
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,610
- Dang.
- Wow.

361
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:01,978
I know.

362
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:04,314
Jeffords, I need you to digitize
all your case files

363
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:07,350
from 1995 to 1999 inclusive
by tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

364
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,118
But it's already 1:00.

365
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:11,120
I told Sharon
we'd have dinner tonight.

366
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:13,056
I was gonna have
a cup of coffee

367
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:15,892
so that I could stay up
and... kiss.

368
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:18,361
I suggest putting that
caffeine towards something

369
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:21,998
more productive
than "kissing."

370
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:24,167
Sir, what are you doing?

371
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,236
Making sure Jeffords'
case files are digitized

372
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:28,238
by tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

373
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:30,773
I thought I was
perfectly clear.

374
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:34,177
I've got to call my wife,
tell her date night is off.

375
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:37,614
I sent her all those kiss-face
emojis for no damn reason.

376
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,182
Oh, no.

377
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,217
Despite what I've been
saying for years,

378
00:13:41,218 --> 00:13:43,987
that ass just might quit.

379
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:45,388
I don't get it.

380
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:46,890
There's no rhyme or reason
to the locations they hit.

381
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:48,524
This place was so
well-guarded.

382
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:49,993
And why not hit the one
down the street

383
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,327
that just has an old man
out front?

384
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:53,830
It just seems so random.

385
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:57,300
Yeah, it's like...
oh, that feels great.

386
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:58,601
I don't think it's random.

387
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,336
These guys are too good,
you know.

388
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:01,905
We'll crack it.

389
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:03,306
I'm gonna go grab
some coffee.

390
00:14:03,307 --> 00:14:04,874
Great.

391
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,576
Mm.

392
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,511
Hey, now that it's just us,

393
00:14:08,512 --> 00:14:11,181
there's a thing
I wanted to...

394
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:13,850
to say a-da-za you.

395
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,118
Why doesn't your mouth work?

396
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,719
Why doesn't your mouth work?
Title of our sex tape.

397
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,687
- What?
- Your sex tape.

398
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,055
What?
No.

399
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:22,959
Look,
here's what I wanted to say.

400
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,827
Oh, no.
I just figured it out.

401
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,563
- Huh?
- Here, look.

402
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:28,932
The trash cans, the van,
the jumpsuit,

403
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,700
they all say
"Johnny's Janitorial."

404
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:31,734
Not random.

405
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,636
They cased each location
as cleaners.

406
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,471
That's why the van
was so spotless.

407
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:36,606
Hey, what did I miss?

408
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,107
Jake just solved the case.

409
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:40,176
Holy crap.
That's awesome.

410
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:42,412
All right.

411
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:45,415
I mean, but, you know,
it's not totally done yet.

412
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,050
You know,
still a long way to go.

413
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,219
Tons of paperwork,
and a case is never truly done

414
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,553
until the trial is complete

415
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:53,089
and the sentence is served
completely to its fruition

416
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,324
in prison.

417
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,992
Jake, just celebrate.

418
00:14:55,993 --> 00:14:57,861
Okay.

419
00:14:57,862 --> 00:14:59,629
Wow.

420
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:03,925
Why the long face?

421
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:05,927
That Mexican candy
giving you nerve damage again?

422
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:07,962
Probably, but who even cares?

423
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:09,230
Why'd I have to solve the case?

424
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:10,732
Why couldn't I have just
let those guys continue

425
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,267
to terrorize Brooklyn
until I built up the nerve

426
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:13,268
to ask out a girl?

427
00:15:13,302 --> 00:15:14,369
You're a good cop.

428
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,730
Do not beat yourself up
about that.

429
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:17,205
I'm not a good cop.
I'm an amazing cop.

430
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:18,825
And I'll never
forgive myself.

431
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:20,675
The case is over,
Amy and Majors are on their way

432
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:21,810
to The Keychain right now.

433
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:22,810
It's too late.

434
00:15:22,812 --> 00:15:24,112
Has she done
the double tuck yet?

435
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:25,680
When Amy really likes a guy,

436
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:27,082
she gets nervous
and tucks her hair

437
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,351
behind both ears
at the same time.

438
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,254
Well, I can never unsee that,

439
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:34,889
but no,
she has not done that yet.

440
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,924
Then there's still time.

441
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,226
Get in there
and bust up her date.

442
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:39,327
Show her you care.

443
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:40,562
Ruin her night.

444
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,630
You really have
a unique take on love.

445
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,572
Ugh, I've only gotten through
September of 1995.

446
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:51,806
What are you guys doing here?

447
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,641
Blowing your stupid mind.

448
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,176
We did the rest
of the files for you.

449
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:57,112
Seriously?

450
00:15:57,113 --> 00:15:58,980
I'm gonna text my wife.

451
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:01,483
Now there's time for dinner
and a movie.

452
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:03,418
And none of that
"on demand" crap.

453
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,188
Tonight I'm gonna fall asleep
in a real movie theater.

454
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:09,658
Yeah, that's how we do it
in the Nine-Nine.

455
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:11,026
We've got each others' backs.

456
00:16:11,027 --> 00:16:12,093
Damn right.

457
00:16:12,094 --> 00:16:14,362
Charles, make your own point.

458
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:15,797
Don't just pile onto mine.

459
00:16:15,798 --> 00:16:17,165
Gina, where have you been?

460
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,466
You left your cell phone
on your desk,

461
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,601
and I assumed you were dead.

462
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:21,936
Mm, I would clearly be
buried with my phone.

463
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:25,940
Sir, these guys already
digitized all my files for me.

464
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,709
- Isn't that amazing?
- What?

465
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:29,778
Why did you snatch up
Sergeant Jeffords' task?

466
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:31,379
Because we're trying
to get him to stay.

467
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,048
Well, that's not your job.

468
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:34,683
And Jeffords, you can
stay here and digitize

469
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:37,118
2000 through 2005 inclusive.

470
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,486
I expect it done
by the morning.

471
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:42,857
Great.

472
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:44,459
Now I have to re-cancel
on Sharon.

473
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:47,562
If I worked at Copperhead,
I'd be home by now

474
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:49,331
swimming in a pool
of gold coins,

475
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,299
like my boy, Scrooge McDuck.

476
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:56,871
Password?

477
00:16:56,906 --> 00:16:58,540
- Tropical.
- Mm-mm.

478
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:00,608
That's an old password.

479
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:01,676
It changes every night.

480
00:17:01,711 --> 00:17:05,347
All right, fine.
Tropical one?

481
00:17:05,381 --> 00:17:06,815
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Augh!

482
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,783
Ahh!

483
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,353
Ha-ha.
Not cool, okay?

484
00:17:11,354 --> 00:17:13,788
Look, just ask Milo
the bartender, all right?

485
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:15,924
He knows me.
Tell him Orange Soda is back.

486
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:17,258
I don't know no Milo.

487
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:19,828
The bartenders also change
their names every night.

488
00:17:19,862 --> 00:17:23,999
And get out of here until
you know the password, man.

489
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:26,768
Damn it.
This place is so cool.

490
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:29,770
Come on, strangers.

491
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:32,073
Show me your lips.

492
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:33,475
There you go.

493
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:34,943
Got it.

494
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,751
Pepper.

495
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:43,752
Pooper.

496
00:17:47,223 --> 00:17:49,290
Popcorn.

497
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,861
Plor-pa-pa.

498
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:54,195
Plorp.

499
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:55,196
Pa-aark.

500
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,498
Parked.

501
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,333
Okay.

502
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,107
Yeah.

503
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:09,277
Nooorse.

504
00:18:13,115 --> 00:18:14,215
Bull's-eye.

505
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:19,154
Oh, no, the double tuck.

506
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:23,024
Oh, hey.

507
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:25,327
You wouldn't kick out a hopeless
romantic who's only here

508
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:26,628
in the name of love,
would you?

509
00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:28,630
Ooh, you would.

510
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:33,860
Terry!

511
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:35,528
So what happened at breakfast
with Gary?

512
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:37,263
Are you leaving us
for Copperhead?

513
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:39,932
Because I'm prepared to light
Charles on fire in protest.

514
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,367
Relax.

515
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:44,170
I declined the offer,
told them I wasn't interested.

516
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,171
Eat it, Gary.

517
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,606
I gave him back all his swag,

518
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:51,077
except the puffy vest,
which I, uh, lost.

519
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:00,486
I'm staying
at the Nine-Nine!

520
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,490
Great news, Sergeant.

521
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:05,692
Really?

522
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:08,261
So you're done trying
to push him out, Yoko?

523
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:10,997
Whoa, don't give
Captain Holt a hard time.

524
00:19:10,998 --> 00:19:12,365
He's the reason I'm staying.

525
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,967
I don't know what
you're talking about.

526
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,636
You're an adult, and you came
to your own decision.

527
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:18,972
Look at me.
I can't keep a straight face.

528
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:20,907
I played you like a fiddle.

529
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,108
Yeah, you did.

530
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,110
Digitizing those old files
reminded me

531
00:19:24,111 --> 00:19:27,547
of all the cases I worked and
all the good we do in a community.

532
00:19:27,548 --> 00:19:30,583
What's best for my family
is that they grow up with a dad

533
00:19:30,584 --> 00:19:32,018
who's proud of what he does.

534
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:33,586
Thank you, Captain.

535
00:19:33,587 --> 00:19:35,154
Look at you.

536
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:39,158
You're like the wise old owl
from those lollipop commercials.

537
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,760
Terry's back!

538
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:44,297
Hey, buddy, sorry I'm late.

539
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:46,266
I had to get this dumb medal
from the commissioner

540
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,834
for a double-murder
I solved last year.

541
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:48,835
Been there.

542
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:50,436
I had a pretty crazy
morning myself.

543
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:52,472
Jake, your taquitos exploded
in the toaster oven.

544
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:54,707
Thanks, Rosa.
10-4. Copy that.

545
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,142
So how did it go
with Santiago?

546
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:57,577
Actually, she wasn't into it.

547
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:58,578
Swing and a miss.

548
00:19:58,579 --> 00:19:59,578
You're kidding.

549
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,747
Yeah, it was really weird.

550
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:02,181
I've never been
turned down before,

551
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:03,716
so unexpected.

552
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:06,819
I'm excited to see
what happens to me next.

553
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
Okay.

554
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,425
So... Blotter Dynamite
struck out, huh?

555
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:13,726
I know, but why?

556
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:15,561
What does it mean,
and why did she double tuck?

557
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:16,930
And how come she
turned him down?

558
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:18,064
Do you think it has
something to do with me?

559
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:19,065
- Rosa, what is she thinking?
- Jake.

560
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:20,366
Yeah,
I should ask her myself.

561
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,670
Hey, you just missed Majors.

562
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:25,605
I've got to say, he was looking
a little bit rough,

563
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:28,207
almost like he was up all night
crying or something.

564
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,342
Ha-ha, Jake.

565
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:30,677
I'm sure he's fine.

566
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:33,179
So...
what happened?

567
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,847
Well, I thought
we were getting a drink

568
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:36,082
to celebrate
closing the case.

569
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,217
But apparently,
he thought it was a date.

570
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:39,686
Right, and you were
not into that,

571
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:42,355
because he's so muscular
and in command of his finances?

572
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:46,059
He's great, but after everything
that happened with Teddy

573
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,027
and all the cops I know
who go out and break up

574
00:20:48,028 --> 00:20:49,529
and then still have
to work together,

575
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,964
it's just too messy.

576
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:52,966
I don't date cops.

577
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,468
Cool. Cool.

578
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:57,537
Yeah, actually, that's funny.
I have the same rule.

579
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:58,938
No more cops.

580
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:01,074
From this point on,
it's strictly dating criminals.

581
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:02,642
If you break up with them,

582
00:21:02,643 --> 00:21:04,244
you can always send them
to jail forever.

583
00:21:04,245 --> 00:21:05,912
Exactly, nice and clean.

584
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:08,114
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

585
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,116
Hey, I got an email
from the commissioner's office

586
00:21:10,117 --> 00:21:11,150
about our case.

587
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:12,218
What did they say?

588
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,122
Ahh!
Ahh. Ah-ha.

589
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:17,223
You got me with my thing.

590
00:21:17,224 --> 00:21:18,224
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

591
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:19,259
Oh!
