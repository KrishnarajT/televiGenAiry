1
00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:04,559
Hey, you guys see the dude
I brought in today...

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,957
The drug dealer?
81 years old.

3
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:09,598
I think it's the oldest collar
of my entire career.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,857
I once arrested a 96-year-old
for flashing.

5
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,822
I was terrified he'd die
in my backseat...

6
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:16,217
Or flash me.

7
00:00:16,218 --> 00:00:19,554
My oldest collar was 78,
but the PCP

8
00:00:19,555 --> 00:00:20,888
made her fight
like she was 20.

9
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:22,423
What about two
50-year-old twins?

10
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:23,758
Does that count
as a 100-year-old?

11
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:24,761
- No good.
- No.

12
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:27,675
You talking oldest bags?
68.

13
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:29,729
That's not that old.
Yeah, but I was only 20.

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,411
20? Were you even
a cop then?

15
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:34,518
No, man, it was before
I got into the academy.

16
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:39,028
Charles isn't talking
about his oldest arrest.

17
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:40,062
Ew!

18
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:41,097
No... yes, I am.

19
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,899
Yeah, oldest arrest...
68, like I said.

20
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,901
God, you had sex
with a 68-year-old

21
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:46,269
when you were in your 20s?

22
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,571
You know how it is.

23
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:49,608
When you have a chance
to bed an older woman, you...

24
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,609
No, that is not an older woman.
That's an old woman!

25
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,010
That's someone's grandma!

26
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,579
She was, actually.
That's how I met her.

27
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,550
Went to college
with her grandson Marvin.

28
00:00:57,551 --> 00:00:59,453
Don't... don't knock it
till you try it.

29
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,689
She had a replacement hip
with some serious torque.

30
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,059
It was like having sex
with a transformer.

31
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,261
No.
That is no one's fantasy.

33
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,234
Peralta...

34
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:30,069
Where are we
on the Lincoln place murder?

35
00:01:30,103 --> 00:01:32,737
Well, like I told Captain Holt
earlier this week,

36
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:35,072
we are at the one-yard line.
It's a football reference.

37
00:01:35,106 --> 00:01:37,707
Yes, Jake.
I played linebacker at Syracuse.

38
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,509
Really? In High School,
I played center field

39
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,043
in the musical damn Yankees.

40
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:43,544
Yeah, you don't want
to brag about that.

41
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,579
Peralta, you want
to loop everyone in?

42
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:47,882
- Ehh...
- That was not a request.

43
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,919
Fine.

44
00:01:49,953 --> 00:01:52,522
Get ready for some stuff
on a screen.

45
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:54,891
Meet Fred Gorman...

46
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:58,226
Prominent citizen,
lawyer, corpse.

47
00:01:58,227 --> 00:02:00,561
Now meet his wife,
Ann Hoert.

48
00:02:00,562 --> 00:02:02,363
She did not take
his last name,

49
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:04,399
but I believe she did
take his life.

50
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:06,033
- Nice.
- Thank you, Charles.

51
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:08,869
Now, Hoert had means,
motives, and opportunity.

52
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,571
I just need to find
the murder weapon.

53
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:12,706
For some reason, the D.A. won't
move forward with the arrest

54
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,073
until we find the knife
she used.

55
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:16,208
Is that reason that they want
to win the case?

56
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,242
Yes.

57
00:02:17,243 --> 00:02:18,877
Well, find it.

58
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:20,211
The family's close
to the mayor,

59
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:21,914
and I'm catching heat
from the higher-ups.

60
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,181
I'm gonna ask you again.

61
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:25,416
Do you need any resources
or personnel?

62
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:27,084
No, sir, I've got it.

63
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,485
Okay.

64
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:30,220
Dismissed!

65
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:31,588
Sergeant Jeffords,
my office.

66
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:32,822
Uh-oh.

67
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:34,423
He probably wants
to talk to you

68
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:36,424
about how your shirts aren't
tight enough probably.

69
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,628
Okay, how can we help?
What do you need?

70
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:41,896
I need nothing.

71
00:02:41,897 --> 00:02:44,598
I'm about to solve this case,
meet the mayor,

72
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,266
and sell my life rights
to Channing Tatum

73
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,667
so he can play
my less attractive brother

74
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,901
in the ensuing film.

75
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,570
- Come on, Peralta,
- Holt said to use the whole team.

76
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,804
We all want this solved.

77
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:56,407
I appreciate the offer,
but I work best alone...

78
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:58,209
Except when it comes
to sex.

79
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,578
Actually,
sometimes including sex.

80
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,079
Will you just let us help?

81
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,313
Okay, fine.

82
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:06,014
I will let one
of you help me... Charles.

83
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:07,549
Yeah!

84
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,350
And I am choosing Charles
because he's the least likely

85
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:10,718
to steal my thunder.

86
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,687
I would never steal
his thunder.

87
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:15,522
I-I'd be afraid to borrow it.

88
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:19,391
Terry, I'd like you
to accompany me to a gun range.

89
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:21,560
You mean drive you there
and wait outside...

90
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:23,127
Far away from the guns.

91
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:25,596
I spent eight years
in the public affairs office,

92
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:27,230
so my tactical skills
are a little rusty.

93
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:28,665
I need some pointers.

94
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,500
Sir, I haven't fired a weapon
since the incident.

95
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:34,335
The mannequin incident...
I'm familiar.

96
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,143
Actually, there was an incident
after that.

97
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:45,277
Another incident?

98
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:52,449
You got to cool it, man.

99
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,117
I'm gonna get some candy.

100
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,718
Sir, I may not be the man
for the job.

101
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:58,853
You used to be the precinct's
champion marksman.

102
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:00,521
I only want to take pointers
from the best.

103
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:02,423
So I'll keep it low-key.

104
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:04,391
We'll go after work
to a private range.

105
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:05,992
No cops, no pressure.

106
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:08,294
Blam! Blam, blam!

107
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:09,862
Gun range.

108
00:04:09,896 --> 00:04:12,331
I told Gina she could join us.
I want to get certified.

109
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,365
There has been a ton of crime
in my neighborhood,

110
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:17,034
and the cops in my precinct
are very bad.

111
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:18,635
You live in our precinct.

112
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,371
Yeah, I know.

113
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:23,506
I know we've
gone over this before,

114
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,273
but I have to ask you again.

115
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:27,408
Is there anywhere
you can think of in that hallway

116
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:28,842
where a knife
could be hidden?

117
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:32,078
Well, since I've already
told you, like, three times, no,

118
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,712
why don't I just record it?

119
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:35,213
Then I don't have
to say it again.

120
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:38,682
The hallway,
like all other hallways,

121
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:41,517
does not have
a secret knife-hiding place.

122
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,419
All right,
you want to hear it again?

123
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,087
Idea for a novel...

124
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:47,421
A mild-mannered doorman
gets bitten on the penis

125
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,056
by a radioactive spider

126
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,624
and becomes the world's
greatest lover.

127
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,159
No, don't stop it.
I want to hear what happens.

128
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,460
This is terrific.

129
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,061
He saves the first lady,
if you must know.

130
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,462
Sounds compelling.

131
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:02,565
Oh, boy.

132
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:04,200
Well, hello.

133
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,801
I heard you guys
were making the rounds again.

134
00:05:06,835 --> 00:05:08,402
All right.

135
00:05:08,403 --> 00:05:10,505
- This one's all you, tiger.
- Come on!

136
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:15,051
Police!

137
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:16,711
Hey, ma'am.

138
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,312
Thank God!
Here, hold this.

139
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,248
The lasagna's burning.
Okay.

140
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,516
Get the dog, but don't
let it touch the baby!

141
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:28,189
Oh. Okay.
Peralta.

142
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:30,923
Yo, I looked at the photos
of your victim on your desk.

143
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,691
Is that Rosa?
Tell her I said hi.

144
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,026
The puncture wounds
are similar

145
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:35,494
to a case
I had a while back.

146
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:36,896
They aren't from a knife.

147
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:38,130
I think it's something spiral,
like a corkscrew.

148
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,164
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

149
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,899
Don't shush me.
I'm helping you.

150
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:42,267
No, no,
I'm holding a baby.

151
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:43,968
That was actually very helpful,
thank you.

152
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:47,205
Uh-oh.
You better get back here. Now.

153
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:57,719
Oh!
Hello, Peralta.

154
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,722
No, no, no!

155
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,285
I don't know why
you're so upset, man.

156
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:04,787
I'm the one who had to come
to this backwater stink hole.

157
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:05,935
What's up, little man?

158
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:08,124
What's up?
Feeling sexy? Huh?

159
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,459
Yeah, I feel sexy.

160
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,827
Yeah, you look sexy, man.
You know I do.

161
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,863
Watch out for that door.

162
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,132
Yo, how much you bench,
seriously?

163
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,301
Captain, please, please,
pretty please

164
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:19,908
do not let him take over
my case.

165
00:06:19,936 --> 00:06:22,271
Major crimes is stepping in.
Nothing I can do.

166
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:23,405
You're off the case.

167
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,773
I can't believe
you're just rolling over

168
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:26,775
and giving my murder away
to The Vulture.

169
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,310
We call him The Vulture
because he swoops in

170
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:29,879
and solves cases
that are almost solved

171
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,380
and takes the credit
for himself.

172
00:06:31,415 --> 00:06:33,963
Yes, Boyle, I put that together
from context.

173
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:36,633
First of all,
major crimes has jurisdiction

174
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:37,887
over any and all cases
they want to take.

175
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:39,355
But more importantly,

176
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,524
you're the one who insisted
on working alone.

177
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:43,693
I told you for weeks
to use the squad,

178
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,861
and you refused.

179
00:06:44,895 --> 00:06:46,329
I used them.

180
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,398
I mean, Rosa's the one
who figured out the corkscrew.

181
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,867
And Charles caught a dog.

182
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,370
Oh, congratulations,
Detective Boyle.

183
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:54,838
You should've
involved him sooner.

184
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,706
Turn over your files
to Detective Pembroke.

185
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:58,208
Sir, call him The Vulture.

186
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,576
Giving him a name
makes him human.

187
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,545
Turn over the files.

188
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,646
Fine.

189
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:04,881
But in protest,

190
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,951
I'm walking over there
extremely slowly.

191
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,692
Thank you.

192
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:19,763
God! This is so boring!

193
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,465
For both of us.

194
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:23,066
You know,
before I solve this case,

195
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,769
I'd like to thank you for doing
all the super-easy work,

196
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,904
you know, the real
Nancy Drew-level stuff.

197
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:30,311
Oh, yeah? Did Nancy Drew solve
a lot of murders?

198
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:32,309
Yeah, she did...
Murder on Ice,

199
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,510
Recipe for Murder.

200
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:35,078
Nancy was
a wonderful Detective.

201
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,246
I wanted to be her
when I grew up.

202
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,548
Thanks, Charles.
That's helpful.

203
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:41,884
Hey! Should we take odds on
how fast I'll solve this case?

204
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,320
- Nope.
- I mean, what was it with Diaz's last

205
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:45,622
"impossible" extortion case?

206
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,757
What was it, six hours?

207
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,759
That's because
it was 98% solved.

208
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:52,462
The last 2%
is the hardest to get.

209
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:54,297
That's why they leave it
in the milk.

210
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:55,599
What?

211
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,766
Oh! Wow!

212
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,568
Looking good, Santiago.

213
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,203
You foxy ma.

214
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:01,672
Go rot in hell.

215
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,240
This is your fault.

216
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,776
Thanks, champ.
Good effort.

217
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,445
I got it from here.

218
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,113
And, hey,
you feel free to call me

219
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,781
anytime you need me
to come down here

220
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,105
and help powder
that big white ass of yours.

221
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,020
Well, that's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

222
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:22,610
I hate The Vulture so much!

223
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,880
Me too.
But he's kind of hot.

224
00:08:25,914 --> 00:08:27,281
What?

225
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:28,816
You can hate people
and still think they're hot.

226
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,351
Case in point,
Manuel Noriega.

227
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,920
You know what?
I'm with you on this.

228
00:08:32,921 --> 00:08:34,085
Tonya Harding.

229
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:36,356
- Yeah, she's thick.
- Right?

230
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:38,325
- Always classy, Jake.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,360
Sorry you got vultured.

232
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,561
Happens to the best of us.

233
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,863
On my count.

234
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,719
One, two...

235
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,833
Three!
I got it from here!

236
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,068
Yeah!

237
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,936
Get up! Get up!
Turn around!

238
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,572
You have the right
to remain silent.

239
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,874
Anything you say...

240
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,076
Can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

241
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,277
Thanks, guys,
I got it from here.

242
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:58,779
Let's go.
Beat it!

243
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,847
Skim white chocolate macchiato
for Charles.

244
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:02,282
I got it from here.

245
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:04,484
I used a gift card
for that!

246
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:07,220
God, I just... I want to get
back at him so bad!

247
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,523
I wish I could throw
his cell phone in the toilet

248
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:12,025
or slash his tires...
I don't know.

249
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,560
Or slash
his gorgeous throat.

250
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,729
I cannot figure you out.

251
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,264
Okay, I'm buying
everyone drinks

252
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,399
as long as we're here
thinking of a revenge plan.

253
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,467
Best idea gets 50 bucks.

254
00:09:21,468 --> 00:09:22,769
Throw 'em on out.

255
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:24,203
What if you called him
from a hospital

256
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:26,072
and said his whole family
is dead?

257
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,740
Like, they died
of cancer.

258
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,809
Charles, that is so dark.

259
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,143
I'm putting it down.

260
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:33,513
So my stance feels good,

261
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:35,948
- but I'm still not hitting center.
- All right.

262
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:38,017
Back your left foot up
a hair.

263
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:39,351
Like this?

264
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:40,419
Mm, mm, mm!

265
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,154
No! Gina!
We've been over this.

266
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,789
Well, show me!

267
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,860
Like, wrap your thick,
muscular arms around me and...

268
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:48,961
All right, look,

269
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:51,630
hands here, stand up straight,
chin forward.

270
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:52,932
Hold on, my nose itches.

271
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,366
Gina!

272
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,802
When I lock my shooting arm,
the other hand feels unstable.

273
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:58,504
Now, what stance
am I supposed to be doing...

274
00:09:58,505 --> 00:09:59,872
Weaver or isosceles?

275
00:09:59,873 --> 00:10:01,607
You guys did stances?
Like, I'll be like...

276
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:02,742
Yeah, everybody
does stances, Gina.

277
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,743
Listen, uh...
Hey, all right, all right!

278
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:07,312
Look, hey, both you,
just watch.

279
00:10:09,616 --> 00:10:11,650
That's eight!
He did it!

280
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:14,853
That was only seven.

281
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:17,356
Why are you counting
my shots?

282
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:19,157
Are you trying
to have me recertified?

283
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:20,792
Yes.

284
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:22,427
If you make eight
of ten shots,

285
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:24,429
I can sign off on
you carrying a gun again.

286
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,964
Gina's here
as an official witness,

287
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,165
and I thought
it'd be easier for you

288
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,300
in a no-pressure
environment.

289
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:30,469
I can't believe
you tricked me!

290
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,604
You're too good a cop
to be shackled to a desk.

291
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:36,474
You only have one hit
until you get recertified.

292
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:39,678
So deep breath, huh?

293
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,781
Take the final shot.

294
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:45,884
Don't overthink it.

295
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,621
Just relax and breathe.

296
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:51,056
Bring air into your lungs...

297
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,225
Like you've done
your whole life.

298
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:56,761
Oh, my God.

299
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:59,497
Guys!
How do you breathe?

300
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:01,132
I forgot how to breathe!

301
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:04,602
Is it two in, one out?

302
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:07,039
What if we wrap his motorcycle
in plastic wrap

303
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,107
and melt it
with a hair dryer?

304
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:11,777
Little trick I learned
in gift basket making class.

305
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:13,945
All right.
Here's what we're up to.

306
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,182
Steal his kidney,
burn down his house,

307
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,417
replace his aloe tissues
with regular tissues.

308
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:20,752
Thank you, Charles.
You're welcome.

309
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,787
Leave a dead cat
in his cedar closet.

310
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:25,457
Note: He would have
to own a cedar closet.

311
00:11:25,491 --> 00:11:27,459
He seems like he would.

312
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:29,795
Sneak into his apartment and
burn popcorn in the microwave.

313
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:32,164
Thank you, Charles.

314
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,966
Uh, Scully asked
for mashed potatoes,

315
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,134
so I wrote that down.

316
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:37,403
Well, I hate to say it,
but I think, by default,

317
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,671
Charles' motorcycle idea
is the winner.

318
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:42,074
Yeah!
Winning by default.

319
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:43,375
Let's get into it.

320
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,043
Anybody know
where The Vulture lives?

321
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,412
On third, right near here.
How do you know that?

322
00:11:47,446 --> 00:11:49,280
Chug 'em, boys.
We're rolling!

323
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:51,649
Yes!

324
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:52,850
Take that, Vulture!

325
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:54,385
- Yeah.
- Nice.

326
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:56,053
All right,
give me your hair dryer.

327
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,688
What?
What are you talking about?

328
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,157
Don't you carry one
in your purse?

329
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:01,692
Have you ever met
a human woman?

330
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:03,761
There's a drugstore
four blocks away... I'm on it.

331
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:05,229
Oh, no.

332
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:07,432
Scully traveling
four blocks?

333
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:09,467
That could take weeks.

334
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:11,903
Hoo!

335
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:13,204
Take the shot, sergeant.

336
00:12:13,205 --> 00:12:14,639
I just need a second.

337
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,874
You've had 18 minutes
of seconds.

338
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:22,146
Gina's authentic
stolen police badges.

339
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:23,515
How can I help?

340
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:25,350
- Hey, it's Peralta.
- Oh, hey, Jake.

341
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:27,352
Hey, do you carry
a hair dryer in your purse?

342
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:29,187
Of course.
I'm not an animal.

343
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:31,322
Great.

344
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:32,724
I need you to bring it
to The Vulture's apartment.

345
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,092
There's someone named
"The Vulture"?

346
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:36,194
Tell Rosa.
She'd be into that.

347
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:37,562
Come on!

348
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:39,798
Peralta, why are you asking Gina
about Detective Pembroke?

349
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:41,533
Oh, Captain, hello.

350
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:45,203
Uh, we are preparing him
a gift basket of sorts.

351
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:46,972
Look,
I understand that you're upset.

352
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:48,974
But if you want to keep this
from happening again,

353
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,109
I suggest that you pull
your team together

354
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,846
and solve these cases before
major crimes can step in.

355
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,314
Am I clear?

356
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:59,451
Yes, sir.
That is definitely clear.

357
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:02,021
Thank you, sir.

358
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:04,256
You should be frowning.

359
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,792
Why is Jake smi...
Why are you smiling?

360
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:09,695
Because the Captain just gave us
the perfect revenge plan.

361
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:12,664
We team up
and solve this case right now!

362
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:14,232
That is not what he meant.

363
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:15,801
Think about it, Amy.

364
00:13:15,802 --> 00:13:17,135
We go back to the scene
of the crime,

365
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:19,304
find the murder weapon,
and out-vulture The Vulture!

366
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,540
No one gets in trouble
if we crack the case.

367
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,539
Okay, screw it.
I'm in.

368
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,377
Yes! That's right!
All right.

369
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:27,335
We're angry.
We're getting revenge.

370
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:28,681
We're a little bit tipsy.

371
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,421
We should not be driving.
We're taking the bus.

372
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,729
I love the bus!

373
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:38,903
So the waitress heard
the couple arguing at dinner.

374
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:40,404
Apparently he was having
an affair,

375
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:42,373
and it was not
the first time.

376
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:44,809
Two years ago, she caught him
with a dog walker

377
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,845
who was walking his dog,
if you know what I mean.

378
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,980
- I do.
- Right?

379
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,314
- Yes, I got it.
- Sex times.

380
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,550
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyways, we know it's the wife.

381
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:55,019
You're real talkative
now that you want our help.

382
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:57,655
All right,
it is possible

383
00:13:57,656 --> 00:13:59,924
that I should've brought
you guys in sooner.

384
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,592
But I just get so excited,

385
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:03,527
wrapped up in wanting
to solve stuff, you know?

386
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,629
I get it.
You want to be the best.

387
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,565
We all do.

388
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:11,602
You just don't have to be
such a butthead about it.

389
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:12,786
What?

390
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:14,405
I just can't believe
you would call me a butthead.

391
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:15,974
- Shut up.
- That's so harsh.

392
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:23,414
Hitchcock farts nonstop.

393
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:25,483
Still waiting, sergeant.

394
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:28,219
It's just the target looks
exactly like a friend of mine.

395
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,553
It's just freaking me out.

396
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:31,388
You have a friend...

397
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,224
- Who's just a silhouette?
- Yes.

398
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:35,260
Let's all just count
to a million.

399
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,728
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

400
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:39,998
So then Iceman says,
"You can be my wingman any day."

401
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:42,601
And then Maverick says...
I've seen the film, sergeant.

402
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:44,302
I haven't.
What happens next?

403
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:46,638
Goose comes back, right?
He's not really dead.

404
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:49,808
Goose is gone.

405
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:51,209
- No!
- I know!

406
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:52,978
All right,
here's how it went down.

407
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:55,380
9:45, a man screams.

408
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:58,050
90 seconds later,
wife goes down to the doorman,

409
00:14:58,051 --> 00:15:00,852
says a guy murdered her husband
and then ran off.

410
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:02,487
We know she's lying.

411
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:03,955
We've just got to
find the corkscrew

412
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,457
to make our case airtight.

413
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:07,993
I say we role-play,
see if something sparks.

414
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:09,828
Darling, thank you
for a lovely dinner.

415
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:12,331
Perhaps we should have
one more drink before bed.

416
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:14,733
Don't you
"darling" me, you philanderer.

417
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:17,202
No, you're the husband.
The husband had the affair.

418
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:18,770
I'm always the victim.
I don't want to be the victim.

419
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:20,339
Okay, Charles is the door.

420
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,307
No. I'll be the victim.
Don't make me a door again.

421
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:25,009
Great. Okay, so...
Wife goes into the drawer.

422
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,579
Gets the corkscrew.
Stab, stab, stab.

423
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:30,148
What did she do
with the corkscrew?

424
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:31,482
She dumps it
in the hallway trash chute

425
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:32,683
on the way to the doorman.

426
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:34,318
No, we checked the trash,
like, ten times.

427
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,987
We would've seen
a bloody corkscrew.

428
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,755
All right, Hitchcock,
you're up.

429
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:42,293
The body.

430
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,596
The corkscrew's
still in the body.

431
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,331
No, you're terrible at this.
Go sit down.

432
00:15:46,365 --> 00:15:47,632
You're up, Diaz.

433
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,600
Stab!

434
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:51,302
Then I...

435
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:52,704
Toss the corkscrew
out the window,

436
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:54,005
and it lands
on a passing car.

437
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,308
Security cam showed
no one driving by at that time

438
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:57,609
and nothing on the street.

439
00:15:57,643 --> 00:16:00,645
Okay, I want in.
But I only want to stab you.

440
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:02,947
Fine.
Charles, door.

441
00:16:02,982 --> 00:16:04,549
Right.

442
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,553
Okay, uh, sweetheart.

443
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:09,654
Time to die.

444
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,489
That seems a little harsh.

445
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:14,325
What if it was
a magnetic corkscrew?

446
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:17,962
If the corkscrew was
on a magnet...

447
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,930
It's stuck halfway down
the inside of the trash chute.

448
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,265
I figured it out first!

449
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:22,433
Wow!

450
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:23,901
What's happening?

451
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:25,770
You have a ten-pound flashlight
in your purse,

452
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:28,239
but not a hair dryer?

453
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,075
I can't see
far enough down.

454
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:31,543
Someone's gonna have to go
down in there.

455
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:34,011
Someone
with narrow shoulders.

456
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:35,546
No! I have
broad shoulders.

457
00:16:35,547 --> 00:16:39,216
I have narrow hips,
but broad shoulders.

458
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,219
God!

459
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:42,520
See anything?

460
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:44,222
A little lower.

461
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:46,591
Freeze!
Hands in the air!

462
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:47,859
Ahh!

463
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,594
We're cops.
Broad shoulders!

464
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:52,630
Stuck! Told you...
Broad shoulders.

465
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:55,366
Apparently, our Detective squad
has gotten drunk,

466
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:56,834
compromised the crime scene,

467
00:16:56,835 --> 00:16:59,370
and an officer has gotten stuck
in a trash chute.

468
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:01,672
I need you to lead
this squad, Terry.

469
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:02,940
And I mean really lead it.

470
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:08,079
I hope you take the shot.

471
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,181
What kind of
precinct are you running here?

472
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:11,482
Would you like to sit down,
Detective?

473
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:13,484
You seem upset.
Hell yeah, I'm upset.

474
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,954
Your team disrupted
a crime scene

475
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:19,591
over which they have zero...
Zero jurisdiction.

476
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,859
They were publicly drunk.

477
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:22,460
Apparently
one of them pressed

478
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:24,729
all the buttons
on the elevator.

479
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,431
Only, maybe he just bumped up
against the panel

480
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:27,565
with that big white ass
of his.

481
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,934
What now?
Holt is gonna kill you.

482
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,269
I don't think he will...

483
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:32,704
Because...

484
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:34,305
Voila!

485
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,141
You actually found the corkscrew
in the trash chute?

486
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:38,843
Stuck to the side,
just like you said.

487
00:17:38,878 --> 00:17:41,913
Boyle, we're pulling you out!

488
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:49,288
This is the proudest moment
of my career.

489
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,589
Ah!

490
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:53,926
Oh, my God, you guys,
we out-vultured The Vulture!

491
00:17:55,795 --> 00:17:56,796
What the hell was that?

492
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,230
What? It's a vulture.

493
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:00,299
Now, if you'll excuse me,

494
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,669
I'm gonna take this corkscrew
over to the D.A.

495
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,305
So we get the collar,
not major crimes.

496
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:07,874
Peralta!
Now.

497
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:11,945
Okay.

498
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:13,613
- Before you get mad...
- Shut it!

499
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:14,681
Holt was right.

500
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:15,948
I've been so worried
about my own kids,

501
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:17,984
I forgot about
my stupid grown-up kids.

502
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:19,485
That's insulting.

503
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,020
I should've been
on you guys more.

504
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:23,723
And starting now,
I will be.

505
00:18:23,724 --> 00:18:26,092
But if you ever
do this again,

506
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:28,829
I swear I will crush your head
in one hand.

507
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:30,497
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

508
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,132
Okay.

509
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:35,302
Where you going?

510
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,670
The boss is taking heat

511
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,438
for something
that's not even his fault.

512
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:40,140
I can't let that happen.

513
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:42,642
Wait.
Damn it.

514
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:45,278
Look, it's not
your fault either.

515
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,449
And it's not
The Vulture's fault.

516
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,717
It's Amy's.

517
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:52,085
I know. I know.
It's mine.

518
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:53,687
It's mine, okay?

519
00:18:53,688 --> 00:18:56,289
God, I do not love
how this worked out.

520
00:18:58,059 --> 00:18:59,860
Detective Pembroke.

521
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:01,194
Now what?

522
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:02,996
I'd like to cordially invite you
to calm down,

523
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:04,598
especially considering
that this case

524
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,167
has already been solved...

525
00:19:06,168 --> 00:19:07,535
By you!

526
00:19:08,937 --> 00:19:10,457
Looks like you found
the murder weapon.

527
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:12,907
It's a good thing you realized
it was magnetically stuck

528
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:14,275
to the inside
of the trash chute.

529
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:16,243
Congratulations.

530
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:19,613
Cracked the case
all by yourself.

531
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:20,948
We done here?

532
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:26,454
Yeah.
Yeah, we're done here.

533
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:29,324
Hey, keep up
the bad work, champ.

534
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:32,327
Here it comes.

535
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:34,544
Why does he keep
touching my butt?

536
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,702
- Stay foxy.
- Die lonely.

537
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:41,438
Well, case closed.
Good work, everyone.

538
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,773
Let's, uh, call it a night
without any further discussion.

539
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:45,208
No!

540
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,743
All of you broke
into a crime scene

541
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:48,378
under the influence
of alcohol,

542
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:51,214
overstepped your jurisdiction,
and disobeyed my direct orders.

543
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:53,483
Everyone involved tonight
is gonna get written up.

544
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,084
Okay, fine.

545
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,153
Here's everyone who was there.

546
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,588
Jake Peralta,
J. Peralta,

547
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,257
Dr. Jacob Peralta,

548
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,325
who has a PhD
in slow-jam studies

549
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,361
from Funktown State University,

550
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:08,731
also involved was the right
honorable J... okay, enough.

551
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:10,933
My point is it was
a Peralta special, sir.

552
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,135
No one else was there.

553
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,838
Well, Detective,
I'm happy to see

554
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,474
you're learning how to be
part of a team.

555
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:21,043
Everybody go home.
Sleep it off.

556
00:20:22,112 --> 00:20:25,248
Sir?
Thank you.

557
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:27,850
Ultimately, it was
our raw sexual chemistry

558
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,886
that helped him overcome
his crippling fear.

559
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,222
You should just stay
in the office all day every day

560
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,658
and be my bestie.

561
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:38,661
You could join
my dance troupe, Floorgasm.

562
00:20:38,662 --> 00:20:41,130
We're looking for a man
of precisely your...

563
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,500
It's gonna be a long road,

564
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:46,602
but I'm ready to get myself
back in the game.

565
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:47,703
I know you will.

566
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:49,972
I mean, eventually...

567
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:52,174
Not tonight.

568
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:53,942
I need to go hug
my baby girls.

569
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:56,245
Excuse me.

570
00:20:58,014 --> 00:20:59,815
Jake, I have to say,
the way you handled things

571
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:01,817
with The Vulture yesterday
was very mature.

572
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:03,486
Well, sometimes in life,

573
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:05,521
you just have to take
the high road.

574
00:21:05,522 --> 00:21:07,122
Oop! Time's up!

575
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:09,024
- Can't wait to see it.
- Ah, here we go.

576
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,993
- That's good suction.
- Oh!

577
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:12,494
Ooh!

578
00:21:12,495 --> 00:21:13,628
Check it out!

579
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:16,297
- Perfect, right?
- Yeah!

580
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:18,967
"Dear Vulture,

581
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:23,037
"enjoy my big white ass.

582
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,305
Jake."

583
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:25,940
Here you are.

584
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:27,609
Always take the high road,
Charles.

585
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,177
Always take the high road.

586
00:21:29,178 --> 00:21:35,124
