1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,821
Al right, you'll take this one
on the right,

2
00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:09,356
and I'll take the big one on the left.

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:12,193
NYPD!
Santa, stop hitting Santa.

4
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:13,494
What's going on here?

5
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:14,862
I've been on this corner for six years.

6
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:16,697
Suddenly, this guy shows up.

7
00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:17,965
Hey, you don't own
this corner. I got a charity too.

8
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:20,367
Canine diabetes?
Who cares about fat dogs?

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:22,403
They can't give themselves
shots, they got paws.

10
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:23,604
All right.
Calm down, calm down.

11
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:25,473
Boyle, frisk the skinny one.

12
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:26,874
I've gone 42 years without a lump of coal.

13
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,375
I'm not gonna start now.

14
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:29,777
Are you kidding me?

15
00:00:29,778 --> 00:00:31,099
All right, fine.
Come here, buddy.

16
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:35,249
Hey, hey, hey!

17
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:38,919
Hit him in his fat cherry cheeks.

18
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:40,721
Ooh!

19
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:41,956
That felt wrong.

20
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:42,990
Knife!

21
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:44,525
Skinny Santa's got a knife!

22
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,161
That's right. Boom!

23
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:48,562
Just kicked Santa in the testicles.

24
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:54,435
Merry Christmas.

26
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:17,758
Looking good.
Happy Hanukkah.

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,260
You look happy.

28
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:20,394
Let me guess.

29
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:21,562
Your egg sandwich fell on the floor

30
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:22,830
and they gave it to you for free.

31
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:24,265
No. Can you do that?

32
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,799
Why doesn't everyone just drop
their sandwiches on the floor?

33
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:28,235
I was trying to insult you.

34
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,238
And instead, you gave me
an amazing life hack.

35
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:34,875
Oh, Amy, you shouldn't have.
But this is embarrassing.

36
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,644
I didn't get you a present.

37
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:38,145
The gift is for Captain Holt.

38
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:39,613
It's one of six presents I got him

39
00:01:39,614 --> 00:01:42,182
representing the six lessons
that he's taught me:

40
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:45,185
Determination, wisdom, posture...

41
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:46,587
Excuse me, everyone.

42
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:48,322
As you may know,
this is the holiday season.

43
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:50,524
Detectives sometimes feel the urge

44
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,626
to buy their captains holiday presents.

45
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:54,295
Please refrain from doing so.

46
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,896
Under no circumstances

47
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:58,365
do I want a present.

48
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,701
Peralta, my office.

49
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:01,936
Roger that!

50
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:03,437
Oh, my God, I have to return
so many items.

51
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:04,605
I know.

52
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:05,906
Shut up.

53
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:07,308
Thank you for joining us, Peralta.

54
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:08,676
This is deputy chief Gerber.

55
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:09,977
Merry Christmas, chief.

56
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,546
And a very merry Christmas
to you, Captain.

57
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,914
Ho, ho, ho!

58
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:15,416
Captain Holt has received

59
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,017
a number of death threats.

60
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,285
Oh.

61
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,087
I really came in here
with the wrong energy.

62
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:22,356
Captains receive meaningless
threats all the time.

63
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:24,224
It's really no big deal.

64
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:25,492
Of course, totally.

65
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:27,027
I mean, why would a death threat
be a big deal?

66
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:28,529
Oh, that's right.
'Cause it threatens death.

67
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:29,663
It's a hoax.

68
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:30,998
I didn't wanna alarm the squad.

69
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,666
So, please, keep this between us.

70
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:35,502
Awesome.
I'm great at secrets.

71
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,438
Santiago got you like six presents.

72
00:02:37,472 --> 00:02:40,641
Well, it may be a hoax,
but protocol dictates

73
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,109
that Captain Holt
have a security detail with him

74
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,544
at all times.

75
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:45,346
He's chosen you for that detail.

76
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,680
Interesting.

77
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:49,183
And not at all surprising.
I'm his favorite.

78
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:51,285
Tell me, what would this job entail?

79
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,354
You'll be assigned to Captain Holt.

80
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:55,623
You'll be entirely in control
of his movements. Amazing.

81
00:02:55,624 --> 00:02:57,658
He will not leave your sight.

82
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,560
You have the authority
to make decisions that you feel

83
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,995
are in the best interest of his safety.

84
00:03:01,029 --> 00:03:02,329
Oh, my God.

85
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,031
Basically you'll be completely in charge.

86
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:05,366
Oh, well, it sounds really tough,

87
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:06,767
but of course I accept,

88
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:09,169
and I will be willing to put
my life at risk for this man

89
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:10,504
to have to follow all of my orders.

90
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:11,939
Thank you!
This is the best Christmas ever.

91
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,607
God bless us, everyone!

92
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,810
Hey, my flight
is at 8:00 tonight.

93
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:18,412
It's domestic.

94
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:20,914
You think I'll be safe if I get
to the airport five hours early?

95
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:22,650
Five?
No way!

96
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,385
You gotta do seven.
Seven minimum.

97
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,753
Seven. I knew it.
Yep.

98
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,621
Why are you going on a singles cruise?

99
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:28,789
I thought you were into Rosa.

100
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,257
Well, I am.

101
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:32,593
But I've begun to feel
like there's a slight chance

102
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:34,294
Rosa may not love me back.

103
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,863
Hey, how about we grab
some dinner tonight,

104
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:37,031
just you and me?

105
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:39,033
That's nice, and I like you as a person,

106
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:40,634
but I'm just not interested in you...

107
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:42,202
Romantically.

108
00:03:42,237 --> 00:03:43,404
Coolio!

109
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,572
Hey, what say you we grab a drink?

110
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:47,007
You're starting to make this weird.

111
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,076
I'm not into you that way,
and I have a boyfriend.

112
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,021
Got you.
Rain check.

113
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,047
A rose... for Rosa.

114
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:54,281
Listen to me!

115
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:57,584
The healthy thing for you
to do is move on.

116
00:03:57,585 --> 00:04:00,254
So we both decided
the healthy thing for me to do

117
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:03,090
is to just move on.

118
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:04,925
I'm impressed, Charles.
That's very mature.

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,193
Thanks.
You know what's funny?

120
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:08,529
I realized I sometimes...
Oh, no, don't get comfy.

121
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:10,203
This wasn't an invitation to keep talking.

122
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:11,498
Gotcha.
Rain check on the convo.

123
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,267
Yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.

124
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,335
Peralta's busy, so let's just get started.

125
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,137
Now, the Captain won't allow us
to give him

126
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,472
all the presents we bought him.

127
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,741
You are the only one that did that.

128
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:24,778
But we can make him the greatest
Christmas card of all time.

129
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,581
We're gonna Santa hats and big sweaters

130
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,749
and take a picture of us all in a lineup.

131
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,983
I'm sorry, Santiago,

132
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:31,318
but I don't have time for that.

133
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,020
My psych evaluation is today.

134
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:34,288
They're gonna decide if I'm ready

135
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:35,389
to make it back on the streets.

136
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,590
Why do you care what they think?

137
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:37,825
Psychologists are just people

138
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,626
who weren't smart enough to be psychics.

139
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:41,962
Don't worry, sergeant.
We'll add you in later.

140
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,266
Sorry, I gotta go too.
My flight is in...

141
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,668
Eight hours.

142
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:48,836
I can make it.

143
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:49,870
I'll buy a sandwich on the plane.

144
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:51,405
Boyle!

145
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,407
So if Peralta, Boyle,
and the sergeant are out...

146
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,908
Fine, everyone just go.

147
00:04:54,943 --> 00:04:56,577
Yeah.

148
00:04:56,611 --> 00:05:00,247
I could take a pic of myself
dressed up as an elf.

149
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:01,915
Elfie-selfie.

150
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,917
Not that...

151
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:06,386
But I think there is something
you could help me with.

152
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:10,657
You gonna sit there all day?

153
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:11,992
Affirmative, stone eagle.

154
00:05:11,993 --> 00:05:14,795
That's the Secret Service
codename I gave you.

155
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:16,363
Just sitting here doing my job,

156
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:18,699
watching, protecting, bossing you around.

157
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,967
Now, for your safety,

158
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,135
if you could open up your Internet browser

159
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:22,436
and search the words
"pigs" and "jet skis,"

160
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:23,804
and that's an order.

161
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,707
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going, Cold Mountain?

162
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,841
I changed your codename.

163
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:29,343
To use the restroom.

164
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:31,145
I'm only asking this for your safety.

165
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:33,580
Is it a number one or a number two?

166
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,016
Your silence indicates number two.

167
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,018
Let me do some recon.

168
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,123
It's all clear, sir.

169
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:45,893
Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go,

170
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:50,497
go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

171
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:51,865
Cold Mountain is on the move.

172
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:54,802
I repeat, Cold Mountain
is rolling to the can.

173
00:05:54,836 --> 00:05:58,172
Sergeant Jeffords,
thank you for coming in today.

174
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:01,875
We are here to assess
your readiness for active duty,

175
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:05,479
and if all goes
I will stamp this release form,

176
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,980
you can go back in the field.

177
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:08,849
Well, I think I'm ready.

178
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,019
I am no longer fixating on my fears, ha.

179
00:06:12,053 --> 00:06:15,088
Good. But for today,
let's... fixate on those fears.

180
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:18,759
Okay.
Um...

181
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,194
That sounds fun.

182
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:23,130
Let's begin by talking
about your baby girls

183
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:25,399
and your wife,

184
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:27,568
and what would happen to them
if you died...

185
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:29,536
In the line of duty.

186
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,873
I popped your pillow.

187
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,252
Captain...

188
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:47,287
Where do you think you're going?

189
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:49,089
I'm going home to work in peace.

190
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,792
That's a negative, ice veins.
Changed your codename again.

191
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,494
Do you know why I chose you
to be my security escort?

192
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,196
Because I'm a modern-day
Sherlock Holmes?

193
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:58,498
No, I chose you
because the threat is not real.

194
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:01,768
And I thought you'd have
no problem breaking the rules

195
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:03,303
and letting me get my work done.

196
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:04,771
Now... let me go.

197
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:06,273
Well, you thought wrong.

198
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,041
You can't go home.
It's protocol.

199
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:09,776
But if you really wanna get outta here,

200
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:11,578
you can come to my mom's.

201
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:13,146
She lives nearby.

202
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:14,314
Or I can lock you up in the holding cell

203
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:15,482
with an armed escort.

204
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:16,717
Totally your call.

205
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:19,286
Fine. We will go
to your mother's house.

206
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:21,388
I guess I am curious to see where...

207
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,223
This all started.

208
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:25,292
Shotgun.

209
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,462
So... this is my mom's place.

210
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:33,100
You can just throw your jacket
in the closet.

211
00:07:33,134 --> 00:07:34,334
That's a bathroom.

212
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:36,637
Water closet.
My mom's British.

213
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:39,806
Why are there no photographs of you?

214
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:42,309
No holiday decorations.

215
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,378
Nothing but...

216
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:47,014
Motel art.

217
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:50,083
This isn't your mom's apartment.

218
00:07:50,118 --> 00:07:53,020
It's a safe house, son!
You've been protected.

219
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:54,955
Don't say "son."

220
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,556
Get outta my way.

221
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:57,891
Look, you wouldn't stay at your desk

222
00:07:57,892 --> 00:07:59,226
and you evaded your protection detail.

223
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,061
I'm sorry, but I've gotta
order you to stay.

224
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:02,562
I love giving you orders.

225
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:03,897
The only way you're gonna keep me here

226
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,299
is if you physically stop me.

227
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,400
Can you do that, Peralta?

228
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:10,504
I didn't think so.

229
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:12,639
Jordan.

230
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,974
Oh, no.

231
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:16,343
We're handcuffed together
and we've lost the key.

232
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:18,845
Falconer one to HQ,
stone eagle is in the cage.

233
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,148
I repeat, stone eagle is in the cage.

234
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:30,131
I told you the death threat
was not serious.

235
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:32,400
So what on earth are you doing?

236
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:34,435
Look, I know you think
that I'm just goofing around,

237
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:36,704
but I got a direct order from your boss

238
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,139
to protect you.

239
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,707
So from this point forward,
we're on lockdown.

240
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,642
Fine. But before we go
into lockdown...

241
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:42,977
Too late.
You're on it.

242
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:44,178
I'd like to text my husband

243
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,413
and tell him I'll be
coming home late tonight.

244
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:46,847
All right, but for security reasons,

245
00:08:46,848 --> 00:08:48,149
I get to craft the message.

246
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,051
Let's start with a pleasant greeting.

247
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:51,552
How about...
"Hello, honey."

248
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:53,187
You will not craft the message.

249
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:54,855
Okay, Roger that.
"Honey's" wrong.

250
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:56,457
How about "hello, husband"?

251
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,758
How about "hello, sir"?

252
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:00,227
You call each other "sir"?
Give me my phone.

253
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:02,863
Fine.

254
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:05,066
I'll give you some privacy.

255
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:09,470
Maybe put Hitchcock's head
on top like an angel.

256
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:12,640
Like that?

257
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:14,442
No, put it behind the tree.

258
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:15,943
Thanks for helping me make this card.

259
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:17,244
You're so good at this stuff.

260
00:09:17,245 --> 00:09:19,480
I know.
I'm good at everything.

261
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:21,749
All right, so here's
all the pictures of Rosa

262
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,950
that we have.

263
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,585
Which one should we use?

264
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:27,488
She never smiles.
Is her mouth broken?

265
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,490
Well, what about if we...

266
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:32,195
Flip those lips?

267
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:33,627
Oh, God.
Oof!

268
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:35,129
That's horrifying.

269
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:36,364
We have to get a picture of Rosa smiling.

270
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:38,499
Holt's card has to be perfect.

271
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,334
Guys... I got this.

272
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,203
I can make Rosa smile.

273
00:09:42,204 --> 00:09:44,105
Just keep your cameras ready.

274
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,708
Making coffee?

275
00:09:47,743 --> 00:09:49,046
Can you make another cup

276
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,946
for senor tickle and his nueve amigos?

277
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,247
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

278
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:56,720
What the hell, Hitchcock?

279
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,319
I think you sprained senor tickle.

280
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,521
Next time, I break it off.

281
00:10:04,926 --> 00:10:06,360
All right.

282
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:08,029
My safe house, my rules.

283
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,766
This is a no tie zone.

284
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,735
A hungry safe house
is an unsafe safe house.

285
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:19,240
A fun safe house is a safe safe house.

286
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:20,975
My serve.

287
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:26,213
I thought you said
you've never played this.

288
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:27,213
It's very intuitive.

289
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:28,983
Let's have another sandwich.

290
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:30,718
A safe house- watching
safe house

291
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:32,953
is a safe safe house house.

292
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,288
I've already seen the film.

293
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:35,589
I enjoyed it.

294
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:36,991
Wow, I would not have guessed that.

295
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:38,659
You see, those are the kind
of things that you learn

296
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,061
when you're handcuffed together.

297
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,742
And that is the true meaning of Christmas.

298
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:44,465
Who knows we're here?

299
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:47,435
Get behind me.

300
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:48,869
No, no!
Going over!

301
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,205
Standard protocol suggests
that you put me in another room

302
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:52,773
before you open the door.

303
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:53,941
But since you've cuffed us together...

304
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:55,076
I order you to be quiet.

305
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,477
Come on.

306
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:02,016
Freeze, sicko!

307
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,784
Jake, it's me, Charles from work.

308
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:09,090
Okay, let's switch gears,
do a little word association.

309
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:10,825
What do you think of

310
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,193
when I say the word "bottle"?

311
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:16,797
Liquor store, holdup, gun, die.

312
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:17,998
How about "grass"?

313
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:21,202
Marijuana, drugs.

314
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:23,270
Gun, die.

315
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:24,338
Cat.

316
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:25,940
Kitten.

317
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:27,041
Cute.

318
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,677
Calm.
False sense of security.

319
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:31,479
Gun, die.

320
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:33,914
What are you doing?

321
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:35,616
You gonna stamp my form?

322
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,621
No. I just didn't want the ink
to dry out.

323
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,524
Boyle, what are you doing here?

324
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:44,825
I thought you had to catch a flight.

325
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:46,827
I do.
My flight is in six hours.

326
00:11:46,828 --> 00:11:48,229
But the Captain texted me to come,

327
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,497
so I'm here.
What?

328
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,898
You texted Boyle when you told me

329
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,199
you were texting your husband?

330
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:54,335
As the person who's completely
in charge here,

331
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:56,537
I am very disappointed in you.

332
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:59,373
I'm changing your codename
to "bad boy."

333
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:00,774
Oh, I can't imagine what it's like

334
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:02,710
to be disappointed at
someone under your command.

335
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:05,379
Okay, I see what you're doing.
Tushy.

336
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:07,381
It's touche.

337
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:08,883
Well, I'm in charge, and I say it's tushy.

338
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:09,883
Boyle?

339
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,185
I've heard it both ways.

340
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:12,520
Please don't involve me in this.

341
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,721
I'm just here to uncuff the Captain

342
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:15,022
and take him to his old precinct.

343
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:16,223
What?

344
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,825
Old precinct?
Wait a minute.

345
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:19,493
You weren't going home at all.

346
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:21,228
You were going to investigate the threat

347
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:22,830
because it's not a hoax, it's real!

348
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:24,899
Wrong, it's not real.
You're lying!

349
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,133
You have a tell.

350
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:27,868
When you lie,
the corner of your mouth moves,

351
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:29,069
and it just moved.

352
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,671
Wrong, it's not real.

353
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:31,772
You're lying!

354
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:33,107
Fine.

355
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:34,441
I believe the threat is real,

356
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:36,043
though I'm not sure who's behind it.

357
00:12:36,044 --> 00:12:37,711
But this is my problem,

358
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:39,113
and I'm gonna solve it on my own.

359
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:40,514
Boyle, uncuff me.
Don't do it, Charles.

360
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,016
I'll take you on that trip
to the botanical gardens

361
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:43,717
we've always talked about.

362
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:45,052
Uncuff me, and that's a direct order.

363
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:46,554
Don't do it, best friend.
Botanical gardens.

364
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:48,989
This is just like Christmas
at my parents' house.

365
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,658
Why do they have separate dining rooms?

366
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:53,561
I...

367
00:12:54,729 --> 00:12:56,297
No!

368
00:12:56,298 --> 00:12:58,032
That was not one of the options!

369
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,800
I couldn't choose,
I love you both so much.

370
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,970
Who wants to watch safe house?

371
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:09,576
So, including letters, e-mails,
and texts from a blocked phone,

372
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:11,244
we have received ten threats.

373
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:12,746
How many people have you put away

374
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,013
that might want you dead?

375
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:15,348
I've arrested over 600 people.

376
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:16,549
Brag.

377
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,851
Boyle, will you please
read the transcripts

378
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,185
of the threats he's received?

379
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,387
Yup.

380
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:22,389
"Die, die, die."
"Die, Holt, die."

381
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:24,090
Okay, a little obvious.

382
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,625
"You will drown
in your own blood."

383
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:27,026
Better.

384
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,395
Although I would've gone with the whole,

385
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:29,863
"I'm gonna staple my face
onto your face" thing.

386
00:13:29,897 --> 00:13:32,365
Human skin mask.
Classic.

387
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,968
The next one is "I'm gonna
send you off the deep end."

388
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:37,003
"Drowning" and "deep end."

389
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:39,205
Almost sounds like he's talking
about a swimming pool.

390
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,907
It's Haimes.

391
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:42,208
Aha!
Who's Haimes?

392
00:13:42,243 --> 00:13:44,978
Colin Haimes, the freestyle killer.

393
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:48,848
He took out an entire 4x100
meter relay swim team in 1982.

394
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:52,652
Marco.

395
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:57,757
Now you say "polo," punk.

396
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,292
The freestyle killer.

397
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,994
Man! How come
all the killers you've caught

398
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:02,462
had such cool names?

399
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:05,064
The best name I ever brought in
was "narrow shoes" Sam,

400
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,733
because... his shoes were
narrow and his name was Sam.

401
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,601
I get it.
Yeah, you get it.

402
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:11,571
Well, Captain, it looks like
you needed our help after all.

403
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:13,239
Together, we figured out it was Haimes,

404
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:14,874
and together, we're gonna take him down.

405
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,943
Because together, we can do anything.

406
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:18,645
Here we go!

407
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:21,614
I'm finding Haimes alone.

408
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,218
Coming back at you, Jake!

409
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:29,656
Oh, my God, Rosa!

410
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,024
I accidentally opened your mail,

411
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:32,091
but look what it says.

412
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:35,061
"Dear miss Diaz,
you just won..."

413
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:36,396
Rosa, guess what.

414
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:37,864
I accidentally opened your mail,

415
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,065
and here's what it says.

416
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,667
"Dear miss Diaz,
you just won..."

417
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:42,435
No, I'm reading the letter,
and you're taking the picture.

418
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:43,436
What?

419
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:44,838
Ha!

420
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,172
You were trying to get me
to smile for your dumb picture,

421
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,107
but you messed up.

422
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,976
She smiled.
She's smiling!

423
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:51,878
And no one has a camera.

424
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:53,413
Got it, Amy.

425
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,814
Got a picture of you frowning.

426
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:56,049
That's what you wanted, right?

427
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,220
Peralta, for the last time

428
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,354
we don't have to go back to the precinct.

429
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,522
I don't need everyone's help.

430
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:04,390
Look, Captain, you're stubborn.

431
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:05,825
And that's an adorable quality.

432
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,994
You wanna know what's not
an adorable quality?

433
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:09,128
Being dead.
Acne.

434
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:10,330
Yep, being dead.

435
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:11,397
I mean, I give up.

436
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:12,565
What's going on with you?

437
00:15:12,566 --> 00:15:13,800
Why are you being so weird about this?

438
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:15,068
I don't need your help.

439
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,271
I don't wanna involve you,
or Boyle, or anyone.

440
00:15:18,272 --> 00:15:19,873
Because I brought
this situation on myself.

441
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:22,842
No one should get hurt
because of a dumb mistake I made

442
00:15:22,843 --> 00:15:24,577
as a brash, young Detective.

443
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:25,979
Hey, Haimes.

444
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,347
You're gonna spend the rest of your life

445
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:30,083
in a little cement room, doing nothing.

446
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:33,019
And while you're in there,
I'm gonna go for a swim.

447
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:36,990
And after that swim,
I might take another swim.

448
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:38,658
And you'll just be sitting there

449
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:41,761
on your metal toilet,

450
00:15:41,762 --> 00:15:45,698
thinking of me swim, swim, swimming

451
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:48,067
all day long.

452
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:49,435
When I get out of lockup,

453
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:51,704
I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you.

454
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:53,640
Yeah.

455
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:54,908
Right.

456
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:56,409
Wow.

457
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,777
I think I really would've gotten
along with young Ray Holt.

458
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:58,845
Yes, that's why I decided

459
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:00,547
to change everything about my life.

460
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:02,248
Well, frankly, sir, you're still acting

461
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:03,716
like that brash, dumb Detective.

462
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:05,952
If you had truly changed, you'd be saying

463
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:07,921
a bunch of boring,
responsible stuff, like...

464
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:09,289
"Don't be stupid.

465
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,190
"Use the Detective squad.
You're part of a team.

466
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:12,458
I smell like sandalwood."

467
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,960
That's what it is!

468
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:16,195
Yet another terrible impression, Peralta.

469
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,597
But I think you're right.

470
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,332
Wait, what?

471
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:22,468
Sir, I'm sure you had your reasons

472
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,137
for going to Peralta, but...

473
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:26,873
This is exactly the type of job
I would love to have.

474
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:29,142
Okay, the next time someone
threatens to kill me,

475
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:30,443
I'll come straight to you.

476
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:32,111
Thank you, sir.

477
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:34,180
I can't wait.

478
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:37,483
I... didn't mean...

479
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,752
Let's catch this bastard.

480
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:43,222
All right, let's go!
Updates. Santiago.

481
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,158
Looking into Haimes' associates.
Nothing yet.

482
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:47,093
Boyle?

483
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,628
Some intel coming in from ossining.

484
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:50,229
Haimes was released two weeks ago.

485
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:53,399
Good. Hitchcock and Scully,
update on your secret project?

486
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:54,901
Hazelnut coffee'll be up in five minutes.

487
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:56,402
Sumatran's ready to go.

488
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:57,570
Keep me updated.

489
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:58,738
Warrant for the phone trace came through.

490
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,039
We got Haimes' number...

491
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,008
And the last coordinates from its GPS.

492
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,643
The rail yards.

493
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:06,813
All right, we got him.
Everyone suit up!

494
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:08,681
I know there's no point
in telling you not to come,

495
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:10,183
but while we're out there,
you're sticking with me.

496
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:11,484
Oh. Goodie.

497
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:13,519
Man, you really know how to take the fun

498
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,687
out of saving your life.

499
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,422
You heard him, Hitchcock.

500
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:18,024
Get that Sumatran in the thermos.

501
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:20,026
I'm on it.

502
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,668
If things go south,
I just want you to know

503
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:31,037
it's been an honor
being able to boss you around.

504
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:32,639
Anything else?

505
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,908
Yes. What cute little nickname
do you call your husband?

506
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,644
Kevin.

507
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:39,379
Adorable.

508
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:42,415
Sorry you missed your flight.

509
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:45,952
I have a backup flight in four hours.

510
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:50,985
Gotta flush him out.

511
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:52,492
We got his number now.
Call his phone.

512
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:55,194
Smart.

513
00:17:57,698 --> 00:17:59,766
It's ringing.

514
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,268
This is exciting.

515
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,041
That is Haimes' phone.

516
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:10,843
I repeat, everyone converge
on that ringtone.

517
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:16,516
He's heading north on track 17!

518
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:21,754
Hey.

519
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,924
When this is all over, we should
take a train trip together.

520
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,993
Just for fun.

521
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:30,296
Go, go, go, go, go!

522
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:34,934
Ray Holt!

523
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:36,936
Hello, Haimes.

524
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,337
Thought about you every day I was in jail

525
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:39,872
just like you said.

526
00:18:39,907 --> 00:18:41,541
I thought about pointing a gun at you

527
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:43,743
and pulling the trigger.

528
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:46,212
Kinda like this.
Noooo!

529
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,482
Terry's back!

530
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:50,683
Terry's back!

531
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:52,018
We got him.

532
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:53,252
Nice work, Jeffords.

533
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:55,621
Nice work, Peralta.

534
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,156
Captain, you're doing it.

535
00:18:57,157 --> 00:18:59,058
You're emoting.

536
00:19:00,728 --> 00:19:04,063
I need an
ambulance. Boyle's down.

537
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:07,033
What happened?
Am I dead?

538
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:08,901
You saved my life.

539
00:19:08,936 --> 00:19:11,104
Die, pig!

540
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:13,005
Don't!

541
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:19,946
Oh, my butt!

542
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:21,848
Oh, my butt.

543
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,053
He's gonna be fine.
You can see him in a minute.

544
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,556
Thank you.

545
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,925
Sarge, I'm so glad
that shrink cleared you.

546
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:37,060
More or less.

547
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,529
And time's up.

548
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:41,131
Show me how Terry sees Terry.

549
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,100
Oh, no.

550
00:19:44,135 --> 00:19:45,769
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

551
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:47,270
Sergeant!
Excuse me, we are...

552
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,672
Yeah, can it, quack.

553
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,440
Captain Holt needs your help.
His life is in danger.

554
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:51,575
Oh, sergeant...

555
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:54,778
I do not think that you're ready.

556
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:56,146
I'm ready.

557
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,649
Kay, bye!

558
00:19:59,684 --> 00:20:01,918
I owe you one.

559
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:03,920
Boyle got shot because of me.

560
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,155
This is exactly the kind of thing

561
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:06,456
I was hoping to avoid.

562
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,991
Captain, this is our job.

563
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:09,492
Any one of us would've taken that bullet.

564
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:11,528
I'm sorry I've been so difficult.

565
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:12,963
You were right.

566
00:20:12,964 --> 00:20:14,397
We couldn't have caught him
without the team.

567
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:15,665
Well, well, well.

568
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:18,935
It appears the student
has become the teacher.

569
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,670
And the teacher hath become...
That's enough.

570
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:21,838
Okay.

571
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,106
Thank you.
You're welcome.

572
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:24,808
Team pop and lock.
Here we go!

573
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,509
Whoosh!

574
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,379
Come on, still?
We saved your life!

575
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,584
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

576
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:35,852
It's happening!
Whoa, whoa!

577
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:36,987
Yes! We did it!

578
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:39,956
Excuse me!

579
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,124
This is a hospital.

580
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,158
Right. Sorry.

581
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:44,160
People are dying.

582
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:46,062
You know, everyone should just go home

583
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:47,964
and enjoy their Christmas.

584
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:49,699
You don't need
to stick around here for me.

585
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:51,768
Shut up, no one's going anywhere.

586
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:54,037
What you did was amazing.

587
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:55,405
Yeah, Boyle, that was some superman stuff.

588
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:57,741
Yeah, you did the nine-nine
proud.

589
00:20:57,742 --> 00:20:59,175
No ifs, ands, or butts.

590
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,478
Sorry, it's just right there.
Literally.

591
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:04,314
It's just right in front of me.
His butt is right in my face.

592
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:05,548
I have to tell you guys something.

593
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,583
Even though I got shot...

594
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:07,851
In the butt.
Sorry.

595
00:21:07,852 --> 00:21:09,386
I'd rather be here,

596
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:10,787
spending Christmas with all of you,

597
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:12,856
than on some stupid singles cruise.

598
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,658
And I mean that, from the bottom of my...

599
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,059
Butt.
Again, sorry.

600
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,261
Shut up, Jake!

601
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:20,797
Boyle's a hero.

602
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,332
And so is his butt.

603
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,968
I got it!
She smiled!

604
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,169
Christmas card complete.

605
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:30,140
He got shot in the butt.

606
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:36,473
