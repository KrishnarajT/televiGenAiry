1
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:03,253
All right, gang, Diet Day Four.

2
00:00:03,787 --> 00:00:05,454
How's everyone holding up?

3
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:07,557
Honestly, I'm going to last forever.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:11,661
You hear that, bitches?
♪ I'm gonna last forever ♪

5
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:13,195
I'm doing great.

6
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,806
This morning the homeless guy on my stoop

7
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:15,998
said my skin looked dope.

8
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,333
What's going on?

9
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,168
Why do you all have matching bags?

10
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:21,671
We're doing a diet together.
My wife found it.

11
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:24,073
She heard about it
at Mommy And Me Graphic Design.

12
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,576
Wait, it might've been Toddler Karate.

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,891
She takes our little
ladies to so many classes,

14
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:30,046
I can't keep it straight.

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,881
Childhood is truly a time of wonder.

16
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:34,116
This diet is very scientific, sir.

17
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:36,551
All the meals are pre-planned
and delivered to your doorstep.

18
00:00:36,576 --> 00:00:38,276
This is our breakfast:

19
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:41,501
An orange wedge, three cashew nuts...
and a solitarie grape.

20
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:43,395
It's actually more than you realize.

21
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,864
Sometimes I can't even finish
all the grape.

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,333
This seems unnecessary to me.
You're all in perfect shape.

23
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,069
You can always be healthier, sir.

24
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:51,603
And I like the challenge.

25
00:00:51,638 --> 00:00:53,005
Plus, it's good team building.

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,007
We're gonna get through this together.

27
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,875
Hey, guys, pro tip.

28
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,745
Lick the baggie.
There's food molecules in there.

29
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,413
Oh.
Oh, that's so smart.

30
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:11,344
Sync & corrections by Alice
web dl sync snarry

31
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:27,339
What are you doing here?
Isn't it your day off?

32
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:29,541
Yeah, stalker.
It is my day off.

33
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:30,909
But I am here to meet Charles.

34
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,511
Did you hear what he did last night?

35
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,646
Drink it, Jake.
Drink it.

36
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:37,616
What's up your tiny sleeve?

37
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,285
Oh!

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,020
Why is there a bow tie in here?

39
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:43,255
Wait a minute.

40
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,923
Jake Peralta, will you be my best man?

41
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,060
Yes. Yes!
A thousand times, yes!

42
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:50,162
Wow.
Best man.

43
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:52,865
So are you gonna set up shop
in a strip club?

44
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:54,633
What kind of shop would I set up?

45
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:57,169
Hand sanitizer.
I would sell hand sanitizer.

46
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,504
And no.

47
00:01:58,538 --> 00:01:59,938
I was hoping
that my best-man duties

48
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,240
would be all whiskey and cigars,

49
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:02,741
but this is Charles we're talking about.

50
00:02:02,776 --> 00:02:04,777
So we've got two straight days
of wedding planning,

51
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:06,845
plus, he gave me this to prep.

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,148
Fancy Brudgom!

53
00:02:09,182 --> 00:02:11,216
It means "fancy groom" in Danish.

54
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,618
According to Charles,

55
00:02:12,652 --> 00:02:14,153
the Danes throw the most
beautiful weddings in the world

56
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:17,022
and the most violent funerals.

57
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:20,025
This does not look like
something you'd be into.

58
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,293
Normally, yes.

59
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:23,195
But I am now Charles's forlover...

60
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:24,897
"best man," Danish.

61
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:27,299
So it is my duty to support him,

62
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,436
no matter what weird, crazy,
Charles-y ideas he has.

63
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,437
Let's do this.

64
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,605
There he is!
My groom!

65
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,441
Hello, my big,
beautiful B.M.!

66
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,076
"Best man."
Just "best man" is fine.

67
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,210
I hope you're rested.

68
00:02:38,244 --> 00:02:39,478
We're gonna be on our feet all day.

69
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:41,547
I am totally prepared.
I even bought some nurse shoes.

70
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,549
I love them!

71
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,085
Let me grab this!
Let me grab this!

72
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,820
- Let me grab this!
- Grab me!

73
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:50,355
First stop, kagesmagning!
Cake tasting!

74
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,224
Wow.

75
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:54,626
You wanted to see me, sir?

76
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:56,328
I understand you stopped

77
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,163
by the patrol officers' morning briefing.

78
00:02:58,198 --> 00:02:59,465
Yeah.

79
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:00,933
Officer Deetmore helped me out
with my crime scene,

80
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:02,234
so I gave him a little
thank-you present.

81
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:03,635
Hey, Deetmore.

82
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,738
If you're gonna bag evidence
like a five-year-old,

83
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:07,673
you should have the proper tools.

84
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:09,575
It's a "My First Police Kit."

85
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,443
The walkie-talkie
blows bubbles.

86
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:13,712
Hope you can handle it.

87
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:19,852
He mislabeled the weapon, like an idiot.

88
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:21,186
And it almost got filed
with the wrong case.

89
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,755
He could've blown months of work!

90
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,124
You humiliated Officer Deetmore
in front of his peers.

91
00:03:25,158 --> 00:03:27,726
He submitted an official
complaint against you.

92
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,921
Did he fill it out in crayon?

93
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,162
No.

94
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:32,297
But he did use a green pen,
which seems crazy to me.

95
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:35,367
The good news is, if you go
down there and apologize,

96
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:36,969
he'll let the whole thing go.

97
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,604
Fine. I'm great
at apologizing.

98
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:39,872
I'm a very sweet person.

99
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:41,740
Out of my way, Chunk.

100
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,275
Ooh!

101
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:48,013
Jake, I got to tell ya,
the engaged life is amazing,

102
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:50,282
- especially sexually.
- Well, I don't want to pry.

103
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:51,950
- You're not prying. I want you to know this.
- No.

104
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:54,053
Vivian and I have a wonderful
intercourse itinerary

105
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,288
- that we have planned.
- Ha!

106
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:57,722
I'm usually more of a chocolate guy,

107
00:03:57,724 --> 00:03:59,892
but this one's closer,
so I'm gonna do that.

108
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,860
Oh!
Hot, hot!

109
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:02,995
Spicy cake!
Why?

110
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:04,596
That's habanero pepper frosting,

111
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:06,765
because our marriage is going to...

112
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,168
♪ Sizzle ♪

113
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,636
Unless you think it's a bad idea.

114
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,771
No.

115
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:14,907
Sounds like a great idea, Oprah.

116
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:18,377
Two... One.

117
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:19,978
Okay, be kind.

118
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,380
I don't have a model's body like you.

119
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:22,748
Come on, show me what you got.

120
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,352
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly.

121
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:28,087
Liberace, Diane keaton.

122
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:29,288
Roger that.

123
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,856
God.

124
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,860
Charles, Charles.
You're not Scottish.

125
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:36,495
Yeah, get back in there, Braveheart.

126
00:04:36,529 --> 00:04:38,230
Summer linen suit...

127
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,132
casual but classic.

128
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:41,667
Actually not bad.

129
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,736
One question...
can you see my underwear?

130
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,405
Thong!
Why are you wearing a thong?

131
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,806
It's my something borrowed.

132
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:49,875
Get back in there.

133
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,077
Yes!

134
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:53,145
Lunchtime.
Wait's over.

135
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:54,780
- That was easy.
- Totally.

136
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,135
I feel like we just had our snack

137
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,549
an hour and 17 minutes ago.

138
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,351
I never got into diets...

139
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,920
Though I did take diet pills in the '70s.

140
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:05,657
I love these pills.
They give me so much energy.

141
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:08,794
And I can eat whatever I want.

142
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:10,996
Oh, God!

143
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,701
He's dead!

144
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:18,037
Actually, I was in a coma.

145
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,005
When I woke up, I had so much mail.

146
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,307
Weight-loss science
has come a long way since then.

147
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:27,346
"Ingredients... carrot."
Got to respect that.

148
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,548
Damn, Gina!

149
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:30,749
What is that?

150
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:33,018
Oh, it's a sloppy Jessica.

151
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:36,221
Mac 'n' cheese, chili, pizza on a bun.

152
00:05:36,256 --> 00:05:37,856
It's everything I've wanted to eat

153
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:40,392
for the last 48 hours.

154
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:44,129
What happened?

155
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:46,799
I thought you were gonna
"last forever, bitches!"

156
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,600
Turns out I gave up easy.

157
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:50,235
You hear that, bitches?

158
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,105
I gave up so easy!

159
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:55,441
Thank you!

160
00:05:55,475 --> 00:05:56,796
Hey, are you sure it's a good idea

161
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,677
to eat all this shawarma
right before your tux fitting?

162
00:05:58,712 --> 00:06:00,012
Oh, yeah.

163
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,380
I'm not gonna be one
of those grooms who doesn't eat.

164
00:06:01,414 --> 00:06:02,781
Hey.

165
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:04,283
Thanks for being so supportive all day.

166
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:06,452
Best man...
whatever you need, I will do.

167
00:06:06,486 --> 00:06:08,253
Actually, there is one thing.

168
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:09,955
Do you have a pen I could borrow
to sign these forms?

169
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:12,191
You bet I don't have a pen.
I never do.

170
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:13,792
But I will get you one.

171
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:15,494
What is it, some sort
of marriage license thingy?

172
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:16,895
Oh, no, it's my retirement paperwork.

173
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,764
- What? Shut up. What?
- Yeah.

174
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:20,566
Vivian got a job in suburban Ottawa.

175
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,901
She wants me to retire from
the NYPD and go with her.

176
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:24,236
Retire?

177
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,071
Boyle, we're supposed to
die on the force together...

178
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:27,473
me in a big explosion,

179
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,475
and you committing suicide
at my funeral out of respect.

180
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:30,743
I know.

181
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:33,045
But Vivian needs to make
this move for her career,

182
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,713
and I'm excited to go.

183
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:36,448
I mean, suburban Ottawa's great.

184
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:37,983
It has everything Brooklyn does.

185
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,918
- Really?
- Yes...

186
00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:42,554
Other than my job
and my friends and my family,

187
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:45,791
you, interesting people,
museums, restaurants,

188
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,760
every other reason that I have to live.

189
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:49,928
Okay, I'm kind of picking up
on a couple of clues

190
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:51,964
that you maybe don't want
to retire in Canada.

191
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:53,232
Oh, my God.

192
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,827
Jake, you're such an amazing detective.

193
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:56,167
I don't want to go.

194
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:00,032
Okay, Boyle, let's strategize

195
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,333
on how you're gonna tell Vivian

196
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:02,701
that you don't want to move to Canada.

197
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,102
No, Jake, I'm not gonna say anything.

198
00:07:04,137 --> 00:07:05,304
Just drop it.

199
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:06,572
We have the perfect relationship.

200
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:07,739
We've never fought.

201
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:08,841
I don't want to mess up and ruin it.

202
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,008
She's my everything.

203
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,376
- Move your testicles to the left.
- 10-4.

204
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,544
She's your fiancee.

205
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:14,046
You can't be scared to talk to her.

206
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:15,514
Testicles to the right...

207
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,916
You know, can we actually cool it
on the testicles for a minute?

208
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,585
No, I'm on the testicle part.

209
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,021
Honestly, Jake, I wouldn't
even know how to bring it up.

210
00:07:23,056 --> 00:07:24,189
What if it goes badly?

211
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,191
It won't.
Just tell her how you feel.

212
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,093
Say something like, "Vivian, I love you,

213
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:29,628
but we need to talk
about Ottawa."

214
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,764
Right. And then she'll say,
"you're a selfish man-pig,

215
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,133
and I hope you die alone,
and I never loved you."

216
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:36,902
Oh, God.
She never loved me.

217
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,337
She's not gonna say any of that

218
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:40,172
because she's not criminally insane.

219
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:41,573
Okay, just calm down.

220
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:42,929
We'll think of something together.

221
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,276
We're going to the stationery store next.

222
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,511
We can write a bunch of stuff down.

223
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:47,713
It's gonna be all right.
Take a deep breath.

224
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,314
No deep breaths.

225
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,116
Makes the testicles clap.

226
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:54,119
Detective Diaz.

227
00:07:54,154 --> 00:07:56,088
How's your apology
to officer Deetmore coming?

228
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:57,723
I've been working on a letter to send him.

229
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:59,391
Yes, I saw a draft of it on your desk.

230
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:00,759
What did you think?

231
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:03,328
It was so horrifying,
I had to destroy the whole pad.

232
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:08,133
Just go downstairs and apologize.

233
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:10,269
Fine.
I'll say, "I'm sorry."

234
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,337
No, be sincere, like this...

235
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,339
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

236
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:16,341
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

237
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:17,543
I'm sorry.

238
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:18,577
I'm sorry.

239
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:20,546
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

240
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,980
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

241
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,382
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

242
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,617
Good.
That's the one.

243
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:28,703
Still working on that afternoon almond?

244
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:31,673
I've been sucking on it so long,
it's smooth.

245
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:33,642
- It's like sea glass.
- You do you.

246
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,680
I'll get that for you, Ames.

247
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:43,018
Oops!

248
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:44,252
Butter feet...
sorry about that.

249
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:47,889
Sorry? You bumbling
son of a bitch!

250
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:49,724
You just ruined my life!

251
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:51,193
I hope you get hit by a truck

252
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:52,728
and a dog takes a dump on your face!

253
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:53,895
Nothing to see here...

254
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,397
just a little hypoglycemic rage.

255
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:56,531
Move along.

256
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:59,234
I'm so sorry, Hitchcock.
That's not me.

257
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:00,936
I'm never like that.

258
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,437
That's okay.
It was my fault.

259
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:04,339
I shouldn't have bumped your cashew.

260
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:07,242
Cashew?
It was an almond, you idiot!

261
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,044
I hope you drown in a tub!

262
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:12,848
I hope you have aneurysm
after aneurysm after aneurysm!

263
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:14,416
Okay, buddy.

264
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,090
We have got some great opening lines here,

265
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,420
three very reasonable explanations

266
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:19,955
as to why you don't want to go to Canada,

267
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:23,859
and four very attractive options
for your invitation card stock.

268
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:26,828
Well, I like
" Romantic Opening 'C.'"

269
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:28,930
this page about how my life is New York,

270
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:32,067
and I love the Chantilly Ecru
paper for place cards.

271
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:33,802
That is an excellent choice.

272
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:35,771
Those are all excellent choices.

273
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:36,772
You can do this.

274
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:38,086
You're a smart and wonderful man.

275
00:09:38,107 --> 00:09:39,875
With fantastic handwriting.

276
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,376
Sure, with fantastic handwriting.

277
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:42,811
You really think so?

278
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:45,080
Yeah, I think that you could be
a professional calligrapher.

279
00:09:45,114 --> 00:09:47,616
Charles, a professional calligrapher.

280
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,584
You can do anything,

281
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:52,120
including, but not limited to,
talking to Vivian.

282
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:54,990
Right.
Right. Right.

283
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:56,825
Look, I know it's gonna be hard.

284
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:58,260
And she might even get mad at you.

285
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,262
But I promise you will be back
to doing weird sex stuff

286
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:01,430
together in no time.

287
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:03,465
All right.

288
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:05,767
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Vivi.

289
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:08,336
Great idea, buddy!

290
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,471
- Yep!
- Yeah!

291
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:11,573
So who's gonna pay for the paper?

292
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:14,576
It's gonna be $250.

293
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,478
Her name is Amy Santiago.

294
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:18,547
Lick, lick, lick.

295
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:20,849
It's an ice cream cone.

296
00:10:20,883 --> 00:10:23,251
You can't tempt me, traitor,

297
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:25,821
not when I got this big,
juicy cantaloupe wedge

298
00:10:25,855 --> 00:10:28,156
to keep me company.

299
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:30,125
It's so thin I can see through it.

300
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,993
Santiago!

301
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:34,229
Come hold this so it looks
bigger in your tiny hand.

302
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:36,798
Aw, Amy left the building 20 minutes ago.

303
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,133
That doesn't make sense.

304
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,402
Santiago loves cantaloupe time.

305
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:42,037
We wrote a song about it.

306
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:43,839
♪ Cantaloupe ♪

307
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:45,173
♪ Cantaloupe ♪

308
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,676
It's just nonsense without
her singing the high parts.

309
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,978
Where is she?

310
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,816
Amy, where are you?
It's cantaloupe time!

311
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:57,586
Santiago!
Stop!

312
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,754
It's not too late.

313
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,122
I failed, Sarge.

314
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,491
This is my second burger.

315
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:04,793
Okay, I lied.
It's my fourth!

316
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,763
You both betrayed me.
That's okay.

317
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,464
I can do this all on my own,
I don't need you!

318
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,166
I can even sing the high parts!

319
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,334

00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:13,402

Traitors!

324
00:11:17,373 --> 00:11:19,875
Officer Deetmore...

325
00:11:19,909 --> 00:11:21,276
I came down here to say I'm sorry.

326
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,878
Oh, good.
Go ahead.

327
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:24,846
No, that was it. I did it.
I said, "I'm sorry."

328
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:25,847
Hey, I said it again.

329
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:26,922
Now I got one in the bank,

330
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:28,150
so I can do whatever I want to you.

331
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:29,384
What are you even sorry for?

332
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:30,485
Come on, man.

333
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,521
I said the words.
I paused afterwards.

334
00:11:32,555 --> 00:11:34,556
I even averted my gaze
to make you feel like the Alpha.

335
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,857
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

336
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,326
I'd like you to apologize like you mean it.

337
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:40,328
Fine.

338
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:43,031
I'm sorry you screwed up my case.

339
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm sorry you're a terrible cop.

340
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,203
I'm sorry for your goat face
and your rodent brain

341
00:11:48,237 --> 00:11:50,906
and your weird goose body.

342
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,841
I meant all of that.

343
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,711
Hope you feel better.

344
00:11:57,513 --> 00:11:58,847
Hey!

345
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:00,982
So? How'd it go
with Vivian last night?

346
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:02,951
Great.
It went so great.

347
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:05,821
I went to her apartment.
I sat down face-to-face.

348
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,556
Then I panicked and totally bailed.

349
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,757
Oh, no.

350
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,459
But the good news is,
she's on her way here,

351
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,494
- and you're gonna talk to her for me.
- Oh, no.

352
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:13,762
Just tell her I absolutely shouldn't retire

353
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:15,230
and move to Canada,
but don't tell her I think that.

354
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:16,665
- Hi!
- Hi, Vivian!

355
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:17,666
Mwah!

356
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,667
Hi, Jake!

357
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:21,436
Vivian!

358
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,711
Jake, you're so sweet!

359
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,046
Charles told me you insisted
that I come to breakfast.

360
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,149
Because of it being such an important one.

361
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,316
Meal, I mean.

362
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,118
You know that in ancient Egypt,

363
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,820
the peasants drank beer for breakfast?

364
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,289
Well, that explains why all
their buildings were crooked.

365
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,091
Charles, can I see you
in the bathroom for a second?

366
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,226
I've got a mole on my back
that needs a looking-at,

367
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,661
and Charles has eyes.

368
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,496
I do.

369
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:46,975
All right, so let's see that mole.

370
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,301
What? Get off of me!
That was a fake excuse.

371
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,669
Of course.
Totally.

372
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,138
Look, I can't talk to Vivian
for you. This is crazy.

373
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,374
I tried talking to
her, just like we practiced.

374
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,975
But every time I bring up Ottawa,

375
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,810
she says how excited
she is about our future.

376
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,012
Then we made love.

377
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:01,313
Don't say "made love."

378
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,481
Fine, we had wonder-sex.

379
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:03,882
I don't want to know what that is.

380
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,017
I don't want to move to Canada.

381
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,351
But I can't lose her.

382
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,687
You're my best man.
Please help me.

383
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,023
Fine. I'll try.

384
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,958
Okay, but bring it up naturally,

385
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,326
so she doesn't think I put you up to it.

386
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,594
Sure.
How hard could that be?

387
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,429
I'm constantly talking
about suburban Ottawa.

388
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,266
Wait, don't go!
I still have to pee.

389
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,768
Why would I stay for that?

390
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,246
Is it cool if I just stare
at your croissants

391
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,438
for a little while?

392
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,539
Sarge!

393
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,007
You need to stop this diet.

394
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,609
Amy and I folded.
You won.

395
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,512
It's not a competition.
We were on the same team,

396
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,915
until you deserted me for team eating food!

397
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,351
Was that a good burn?
I'm too hungry to tell.

398
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,454
It was a great burn, sir.
Now please eat. You look weak.

399
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,856
I'm fine.

400
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,424
I am stronger than ever!

401
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,459
Watch this.

402
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:49,804
Sarge, what are you...
what are you doing?

403
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,896
No, no, no, no, no.
No!

404
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,532
Wow.

405
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,970
See? I'm fine!

406
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,705
What is happening?

407
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,641
Just a tummy gurgle.
Diet messed up my system.

408
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,376
Oh, no.

409
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,383
Go back inside!

410
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,986
Are you talking to us or the fart?

411
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,589
So, Vivian, do you ever go watch hockey?

412
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,558
No, I'm not one for sports.

413
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,893
Of course you're not.

414
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,730
My graduate student told me the
craziest story about her family.

415
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,331
That's hilarious!

416
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,567
Hey, can you pass me
the maple syrup, please?

417
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,103
Speaking of, where does the best
maple syrup come from again?

418
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,771
Vermont.

419
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,740
Oh, and Canada.

420
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,075
Canada?
Hey, that reminds me.

421
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,077
Weren't the two of you talking
about maybe moving there?

422
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,746
Oh, yeah, we are so excited

423
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,948
to start this new chapter
of our lives together.

424
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,683
Yeah. Well, although
I have to say,

425
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,187
as someone who's read many of the
older chapters in Charles's life,

426
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,588
I wonder if that's the best thing for him.

427
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,324
That's so sweet of you to care, but...

428
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,660
Chuck is excited about moving
to Canada, right, baby?

429
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:57,162
Mouth full.
I love you.

430
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,097
But what about his job
and all of his friends

431
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:01,033
and his Brooklyn-based
pizza blog?

432
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,935
Do they even have pizza in Canada?

433
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,337
Yes, it's puffier, and it's sweet.

434
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,005
It's called Manitoba Sauce Cake.

435
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,974
Okay, there's no way Charles wants that.

436
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,143
Jake, I think you're overstepping here.

437
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:12,945
Charles and I both want to move to Canada.

438
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,882
Is that true, Charles?
Is that what you want?

439
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,886
Yeah.

440
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,189
I want to retire from the force
and move to Ottawa with Vivian.

441
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,659
And frankly, I have no idea
why you're getting involved.

442
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,229
And no one asked for your stupid opinion.

443
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,964
Vivi...

444
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,166
We're leaving.

445
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,567
What?

446
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,302
Detective Diaz...

447
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,271
I gather that, once again,
things did not go well

448
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,539
with Officer Deetmore.

449
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,075
All due respect, sir,
it's how I was trained.

450
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,810
You mess up, you get made fun of.

451
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,478
It's like scientist zapping a rat

452
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,846
when it messes up in a maze.

453
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,148
Oh, I get it.

454
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:53,385
When I was a young officer, I
was that rat and got zapped.

455
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,053
And all I wanted was to be captain

456
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,388
and throw some lightning bolts.

457
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,191
Emperor Palpatine.

458
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,993
I do not know who that is.

459
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:04,229
But a real leader doesn't zap
people when they mess up.

460
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:07,533
They teach them how to fix the problem.

461
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,035
I think you're a leader.

462
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,503
So act like one.

463
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,740
I'll try.
I'm sorry.

464
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,476
Please, Diaz.
No need to make a scene.

465
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,946
- I can't believe he's moving to Canada.
- I know.

466
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,816
And I tried to help him, and he
fully threw me under the bus.

467
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,117
So I quit as best man.

468
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,385
- Jake.
- What?

469
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,719
I did everything right.

470
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,888
I was loyal. I put up
with all his dumb ideas,

471
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,691
his spicy cake, his champagne
made out of olives,

472
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,060
reading his vows as a recipe.

473
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,062
"One teaspoon eternal love,

474
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,364
a dash of peeing
with the door open."

475
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,033
Okay.
That's hard to hear.

476
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,401
Yeah.

477
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,203
I just don't understand
why he's being so weird.

478
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,971
I can't believe he would
turn on me like this.

479
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,306
He's not being himself.

480
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,308
Maybe because he's facing
a terrible decision

481
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,543
and he doesn't know what to do.

482
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,445
Yeah, that sounds right.

483
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,247
I think he needs his farm lover.

484
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,582
It's pronounced "for-lohver."

485
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,883
I don't have time to teach you Danish.

486
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:58,951
I gotta go help Charles!

487
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,452
I'll find out where he is and text you.

488
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,986
That would be helpful!

489
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:07,563
- Charles, get in the car.
- No!

490
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:09,332
Go to heck!

491
00:17:09,616 --> 00:17:10,850
Don't siren me.

492
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:13,453
You quit on me as best man,
I'm not talking to you.

493
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:16,823
Police.
Stop walking.

494
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,727
I hate that I'm so by the book.

495
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:22,295
Listen, Boyle,

496
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,496
you're not handing in
those retirement papers

497
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,731
without telling Vivian how you feel.

498
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:25,898
I won't let you.

499
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,573
Oh, really?
And how are you gonna stop me?

500
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:28,568
Baton to the knee.

501
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:30,670
Baton to the knee?

502
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,006
Oh!

503
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,409
Hey, Deetmore.

504
00:17:36,443 --> 00:17:39,679
I'm sorry for making fun of you
in front of everybody...

505
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,881
And also for making fun of you
behind your back.

506
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:44,584
Didn't know you did that,
but thank you for the apology.

507
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:45,952
I'm not done.

508
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:47,854
Also, I'm sorry for making fun
of you during my book club.

509
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:48,921
Those people don't even know you.

510
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:50,023
That was uncool.

511
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,324
Also, I'm sorry...

512
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:52,692
it's okay.
I get it.

513
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:53,893
No.

514
00:17:53,927 --> 00:17:55,895
Also, I'm sorry that I didn't take the time

515
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:58,598
to show you how to fix your mistake.

516
00:17:58,632 --> 00:18:00,667
Come on, we can go over it upstairs.

517
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:03,269
Thanks.
That'd be great.

518
00:18:03,303 --> 00:18:05,672
Oh, one more sorry.

519
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:07,607
You're about to see a drawing
I did of you in the elevator.

520
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:09,575
Just remember I was really
pissed at you at the time.

521
00:18:13,914 --> 00:18:16,049
I'm unquitting as your best man.

522
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,383
Oh, how kind of you.

523
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:19,352
Are you also taking me
to the knee hospital?

524
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:20,820
Your knee is fine.

525
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:22,155
Besides, you had it coming

526
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:23,423
for throwing me under the bus like that.

527
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:25,758
I'm sorry.
I was terrible to you.

528
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:28,361
It's just I don't know what to do.

529
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:30,063
I know, it's tough.

530
00:18:30,097 --> 00:18:31,397
But I'm here to support you

531
00:18:31,432 --> 00:18:33,533
and not just in your weird,
awful wedding decisions.

532
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,867
"Awful"?

533
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:37,036
Oh. Did I just plan
the worst wedding in history?

534
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:39,706
Second worst.
Red Wedding, Game Of Thrones.

535
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,075
And, no, your wedding
is gonna be incredible

536
00:18:42,109 --> 00:18:43,743
because it's exactly what you want.

537
00:18:43,777 --> 00:18:45,645
What you don't want is to go to Canada.

538
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,114
So I don't care how many buses
you throw me under,

539
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:49,716
I'm making you talk to Vivian.

540
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,152
Okay, thanks.
You're right.

541
00:18:53,187 --> 00:18:55,888
And you know what?
I'm ready.

542
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:57,323
No, I'm not!
I'm running away!

543
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:58,825
Boyle, no!

544
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:00,579
I'm not ready! I'm not ready!
I'm not ready!

545
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:03,262
Hey, superstar.

546
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:05,665
Why the long fart?
Oh, I meant "face."

547
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:07,000
Why the long face?

548
00:19:07,034 --> 00:19:08,134
Keep walking, Linetti.

549
00:19:08,168 --> 00:19:10,803
Okay, but this shake is really good.

550
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:11,938
Listen. Shh, shh.

551
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:13,272
Listen.

552
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:16,309
That's it!
I give up.

553
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:17,944
Why do you care so much about this diet?

554
00:19:17,978 --> 00:19:20,079
Just stop.
You're in perfect shape.

555
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:21,814
Amen!

556
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,149
I'm not doing it for me.

557
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:24,817
My wife is on a diet.

558
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:26,452
She's a little self-conscious
about her body

559
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:27,820
since giving birth to twins.

560
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:29,188
It's crazy!

561
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:31,658
I think she looks perfect, and
I tell her that all the time.

562
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,193
And I love that you do that, Terry.

563
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:36,229
She's running around
after those girls all day,

564
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:37,697
and I'm not there to help out.

565
00:19:37,731 --> 00:19:40,099
This was one thing
I thought I could do with her.

566
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,635
But I'm too weak.

567
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,305
Just hand me that milkshake.

568
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:47,774
Okay.

569
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:50,176
Hey, what are you doing?
What...

570
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,611
Thank you.

571
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:52,979
We are still a team,

572
00:19:53,013 --> 00:19:55,882
and we will keep you from eating
so you can support your wife.

573
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,583
Thank you, team.

574
00:19:57,618 --> 00:19:59,899
However, just to be clear,
Gina and I are still gonna eat.

575
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,855
I'm eating right now,
Terry... corndog.

576
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,724
Come on.
There we go.

577
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,727
You got this, all right?

578
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,900
Hello, Vivian. Charles has
something he'd like to say.

579
00:20:13,934 --> 00:20:15,368
In case he tries to flee.

580
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,675
Vivian...

581
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,344
We need to talk about Ottawa.

582
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:34,454
Jake.

583
00:20:34,488 --> 00:20:36,489
Oh.

584
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:40,026
Hey.

585
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,694
How'd it go?
Everything okay?

586
00:20:41,729 --> 00:20:43,796
Vivian and I talked for hours.

587
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,832
There's a lot more to discuss,
but it's a start.

588
00:20:45,866 --> 00:20:47,266
And you were right.
She didn't dump me.

589
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:50,603
You did good.
I know you were scared.

590
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:52,805
Hey...

591
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,842
Your duties as best man aren't over yet.

592
00:20:55,876 --> 00:20:58,211
What?
Whiskey and cigars!

593
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,848
Thanks for being the best best man.

594
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:04,250
To the fancy brudgom!

595
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,689
Spicy!
Why is that spicy?

596
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:11,424
Not a doctor. Shh.

597
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:16,057
