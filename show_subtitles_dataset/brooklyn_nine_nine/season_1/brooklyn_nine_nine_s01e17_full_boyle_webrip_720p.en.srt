Dryin' dishes, yeah.

2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:07,699
Man, Charles has been
so happy and confident

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,167
ever since he hooked up
with that Professor

4
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:10,468
at the captain's party.

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,707
She has tenure, and also has ten years,

6
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,243
times two, older than him.

7
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:19,678
That sucked.
Yeah.

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,945
It's nice to see him like this.

9
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:22,681
He's so confident.

10
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:24,582
This morning, he finally
corrected the barista

11
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,217
when she called him "Charlize."

12
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:29,087
He's been living as
"Charlize broil" for five years.

13
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:31,156
It's great.
It's all so great.

14
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:33,224
He could take it down, just a smidge.

Sorry.

17
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,931
But whatever, I can handle the singing.

18
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:41,166
I'm just so happy for that guy.

19
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,267
It's about time he caught a break.

20
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:44,736
Sexy train is leaving the station.

21
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:46,705
Check out this caboose.

22
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:48,173
Later, sluts.

23
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,207
Just let him have it.

24
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,176
Great job, Boyle.

Peralta, where are we
with the black cab holdups?

27
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,734
Well...
I got this, Jakey.

28
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:17,936
Oh, all right.
Have at it, man.

29
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:19,537
Nice jeans, Boyle.

30
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,706
Those are surprisingly
low-waisted.

31
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,941
Eyes up here, Gina.

32
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:24,542
I'm more than just a piece of ass.

33
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,010
Ooh.

34
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:27,645
Not bad, not bad.

35
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,382
An unlicensed cab driver's
been picking up tourists.

36
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:32,550
Driver takes the vics
down under the B.Q.E.,

37
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,219
robs 'em at gunpoint,
leaves them stranded.

38
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,154
Unfortunately, because they're tourists,

39
00:01:36,155 --> 00:01:38,089
and our perp is not Caucasian,

40
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,091
we don't have a clear idea
of what he looks like.

41
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:43,928
He was either Latino, Arabor Mican.

42
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,265
Either way, very Muslim.

43
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:49,667
We'll go undercover,
dress as out-of-towners,

44
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:51,102
hope the perp picks us up.

45
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:53,972
Don't worry, sarge, we'll nail this guy.

46
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:57,242
I can't believe I was just
briefly attracted to Boyle.

47
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,749
A Mr. Brain Jensen
here to see you, sir.

48
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,452
It's Brian.
Not according to this note

49
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:10,455
I wrote on my hand
very quickly: "Brain."

50
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:13,324
Captain Holt, we recently met
at the African-American

51
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:16,261
Gay and Lesbian New York City
Policeman's Association.

52
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:17,829
Yes, that name is quite a mouthful.

53
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,364
Just call it the "AAGLNYCPA."

54
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:21,099
Your organization has meant so much to me.

55
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,967
Well, it's not my organization.

56
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,736
I mean, I did found it
and I've been president

57
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,806
for the last 25 years
and I oversee every detail,

58
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:30,375
but really, it's our organization.

59
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,743
It's yours.

60
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:33,077
And out of respect for you and everything

61
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:34,946
that you've done, I wanted to stop by

62
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,681
and let you know I'll be
running for President.

63
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:38,483
I hate to run against you,

64
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:39,918
but I have some ideas for change that'll

65
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,420
bring AAGLNYCPA into the 21st century.

66
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:43,488
I see.

67
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:45,390
Well, it's been good meeting you.

68
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,459
And, I wish you the
very best. Thank you.

69
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,927
Good-bye, brain.

70
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:50,628
It's... it's Brian.

71
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,963
Very nice man.

72
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,231
Yes, he is.

73
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:56,601
Now, let's figure out how to...

74
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:58,636
Destroy him.

75
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,905
How'd the interview with the victim go?

76
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:02,073
It went okay.

77
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:03,408
The guy was from Canada,
said it was probably

78
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:04,676
his fault for getting robbed,

79
00:03:04,677 --> 00:03:05,977
and apologized for wasting my time.

80
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,345
Oh, Canada.

81
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:09,647
Truly Odie to America's
Garfield. -

82
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,748
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night?

83
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,016
I think I can get us some Nets tickets.

84
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,251
No go, amigo.

85
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:16,287
Tomorrow is Vivi's and
my big 20-day anniversary.

86
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:17,822
I'm pulling out all the stops.

87
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,225
Dinner at Le Bonbon, with
300 roses at the table.

88
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:21,459
No. Oh, man.

89
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,329
Then a gondola ride
along the Gowanus Canal.

90
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,564
No. No, no, no, no, no.
And then, a skywriter's

91
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,666
gonna write,
"Charles loves V."

92
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,934
I couldn't afford her full name.

93
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,836
Okay, first of all, "Charles loves V"

94
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,404
means something very specific

95
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,073
and, I'm gonna guess,
not what you're intending.

96
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:38,076
But more importantly,
you're going full Boyle.

97
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:39,644
What? I am not.

98
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:41,579
What's full Boyle?
Anytime Charles gets

99
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,448
into a new relationship,
he gets way too intense

100
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,684
way too fast, and it always
ends in heartbreak.

101
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,986
We met on the subway,

102
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:49,721
went out to dinner,
and I told her loved her.

103
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:51,789
And my mom was so happy.

104
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,592
And then the barbershop quartet
I hired started to sing.

105
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:56,661
And then she broke up with me.
And then she broke up with you.

106
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:57,929
Yes!

107
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,765
Oh, Joanna, no!

108
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:01,933
Courtney!

109
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:03,134
Rhonda!

110
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:04,802
I know when I'm going full Boyle.

111
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:06,170
Trust me, this is different.

112
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:07,405
I have it under control.

113
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,941
Gotta go, Jakey.

114
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,442
Excuse me.

115
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:13,044
Are you a detective?

116
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,113
Oh, who's asking?

117
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:18,683
I'm Super Dan, scourge of
Brooklyn's underworld,

118
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:21,119
and I need to talk
to an officer of the law.

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,389
I'm busy right now,
working on this... excuse.

120
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,723
I think Santiago's free.

121
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,158
Hi.

122
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:28,893
I'm Super Dan.

123
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,562
And I have a crime to report.

124
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:33,097
Oh, gosh, I am so sorry.

125
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:35,867
I literally just retired.

126
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:38,870
This is my retirement cake.

127
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,806
Thanks, you guys.
I'm gonna miss this place.

128
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,675
Why aren't you guys taking me seriously?

129
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:47,245
Your cape and your tights,
and your name is Super Dan,

130
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,913
and I can kinda see your penis.

131
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,149
And it's just all a rich tapestry.

132
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,483
Yeah, well, I'm a citizen.

133
00:04:52,484 --> 00:04:53,885
I'm from this neighborhood.

134
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:56,721
So the only reason
I'm wearing this costume

135
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:59,591
is so when I'm fighting crime,

136
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,292
people will respect my authority.

137
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:02,594
How's that working out for you?

138
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,296
Detectives, when a citizen
comes in off the street,

139
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:07,799
it is NYPD policy to take a statement.

140
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,702
This isn't enough of a statement?

141
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:12,770
Yes, I wanted to inquire

142
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,372
about renting out the Statue of Liberty

143
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:15,907
for a romantic evening.

144
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:18,676
Is there a bed in the torch?

145
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:20,244
No? Okay.

146
00:05:20,245 --> 00:05:21,346
I'll get back to you.

147
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:23,114
Hey there, Charles.

148
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,716
I thought maybe we should
have a little chat

149
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:26,150
about how crazy you're acting,

150
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,785
and how you're blowing this beyond repair.

151
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,455
Are you really qualified
to give romantic advice?

152
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,324
You're not exactly the king
of mature relationships.

153
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:34,726
Fair enough.
But I would argue

154
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,861
that I am like a beautiful angel of love,

155
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:38,563
who has trouble finding love for himself.

156
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:39,831
Admit that you would see that movie.

157
00:05:39,832 --> 00:05:40,865
I would.

158
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:42,000
Thank you for honesty.

159
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:43,401
But this is not about me.

160
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:44,669
It's about Charles.

161
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,871
I've seen this before,
buddy, and it is bad.

162
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:48,840
Jake, I'm nowhere near full Boyle.

163
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:52,343
Then prove it. Just push your
anniversary dinner one night.

164
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:54,312
Say, "Vivian, tomorrow
doesn't work for me.

165
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:55,413
Can we reschedule?"

166
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:58,282
If this will convince you,
more than happy.

167
00:05:58,283 --> 00:06:00,018
No problem.
Great.

168
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,552
Voice mail.

169
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:03,688
God, I love how she says
the words, "you've reached."

170
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,890
Hi, Vivi. It's Chucklebunny.
Oof.

171
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:09,861
I'm just calling about dinner tomorrow.

172
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:10,928
I can't wait to see you,

173
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:12,263
my luscious little breakfast quiche.

174
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:13,831
I just wanna draw you a bubble bath

175
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,466
and spoon-feed you caviar.

176
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,201
I think we should open up
a joint checking account.

177
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,703
I love you...
What am I doing?

178
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:22,240
It's okay. I hung up
right after "Chucklebunny."

179
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:25,209
Help me.
I've gone full Boyle.

180
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:31,432
I need to focus on my reelection campaign.

181
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,800
Clear my schedule.

182
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:34,536
You really care about
this little club?

183
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:36,738
It's not a club.
It's an organization

184
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,706
that I founded over 25 years ago.

185
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:41,709
I'm proud to say we now have 50 members.

186
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,778
But it wasn't so easy in the beginning.

187
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,613
I'd like to request discretionary funds,

188
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,615
to start an organization supporting black

189
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,250
gay and lesbian police officers.

190
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:57,792
They never actually said no,

191
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,694
so I just went ahead and did it.

192
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:02,330
I've poured my heart and soul
into this organization.

193
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:04,966
And I'm not gonna just
give up the presidency.

194
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:07,268
You should make me your campaign manager.

195
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:08,670
I was born for politics.

196
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,172
I have great hair and I love lying.

197
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:13,908
Find out everything you can
about this Jensen.

198
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,310
I'll work on my speech.

199
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,079
How's this for an opening joke?

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,347
You know what the toughest part about

201
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:22,350
being a gay black police officer is?

202
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:24,419
The discrimination.

203
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,423
I believe that's what
you call observational humor.

204
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:30,725
Probably. That's great.

205
00:07:32,895 --> 00:07:35,263
All right, let's go over our disguise

206
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:38,099
I am Herbert Goffleman from San Diego.

207
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,367
I came here to stand in the cold

208
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,902
outside the today show, holding a sign

209
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:42,904
with a misspelled word on it.

210
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:44,205
Oh, you know what?
You win.

211
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:46,407
That neon green fanny pack
screams, "gullible tourist."

212
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:47,609
It's mine.
I brought it from home.

213
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,277
Hey, can I have my phone back, please?

214
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:51,145
No, because you will call Vivian,

215
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:52,280
and you have the worst case

216
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,349
of full Boyle I've ever seen.
What?

217
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,683
I found this, by the way.

218
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,086
You wrote "Mr. Charles Ludley"
over a thousand times.

219
00:07:58,087 --> 00:07:59,887
Why would you take her last name, Boyle?

220
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:01,055
Look.

221
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,323
For the last two years, I've been

222
00:08:02,324 --> 00:08:04,092
directing all my love at Rosa.

223
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:05,727
So my emotions just piled up.

224
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,028
And now with Vivian, my feelings

225
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,796
are springing out of me like a fire hose.

226
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:10,798
Oh, that is overtly sexual.

227
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,100
Jake, I'm gonna ruin it.

228
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,368
You gotta help me.

229
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,736
All right, here's the plan.

230
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:16,404
I'll text Vivian from your phone,

231
00:08:16,405 --> 00:08:18,373
and tell her you want it
to be a double date.

232
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,208
That way, I can come with you
and hold your hand.

233
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,275
Well, then your hand will be on her butt,

234
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:22,310
because my hand will be on her butt.

235
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,511
You gotta get it together, man.

236
00:08:23,512 --> 00:08:25,413
I told you I need help!

237
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:28,750
Hey, can I get your file on
that Atlantic Avenue drug ring?

238
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:30,585
Sarge gave me and Scully the case.

239
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:32,720
What?
Oh!

240
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,788
Why did you do that?

241
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,923
I-I know I deserved it,
but why?

242
00:08:35,924 --> 00:08:38,292
Sarge, you reassigned our drug case?

243
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:40,995
Diaz and I have been
working it for three months.

244
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:42,163
Remember Super Dan?

245
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,931
The guy you ignored and made fun of?

246
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:45,800
He's been perching on rooftops at night,

247
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,669
secretly taking photos of drug deals.

248
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,737
He has thousands of images

249
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,973
and can I.D. the entire network
of dealers.

250
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,107
What?
But you refused

251
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:55,309
to take his statement,
because he had a cape on.

252
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,178
Luckily, Hitchcock and Scully didn't mind.

253
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,913
I didn't even notice
he was wearing a cape.

254
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,815
You're a cop.
You should've noticed that.

255
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:03,651
We screwed up.
Message received.

256
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:04,986
Yep, be nicer to virgins.

257
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:06,521
She doesn't speak for me.

258
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:08,823
You're not getting your case back.

259
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:10,291
Okay.

260
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,161
Here's what I found out
about our competition.

261
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:16,330
Brian Jensen, born 1899,

262
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:18,599
served in the navy during World War I.

263
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,802
A hero at the battle of Scimitar Hill,

264
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:24,672
Jensen perished in a factory
fire in the Netherlands.

265
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:26,441
This may be a different Brian Jensen.

266
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,476
I've never been in this position before.

267
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:30,378
I've always run unopposed.

268
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,880
If you wanna compete,
you're gonna have to have

269
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,483
a little more pizzazz.

270
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,218
A couple ideas for ya.

271
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:40,455
The obvious place to start would
be you, in a silver suit,

272
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,890
with sunglasses and roller skates...

273
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:45,359
The candidate of fun.

274
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,361
What's your second idea?
Nada.

275
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:50,031
Thought I had a slam dunk
on the first one.

276
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:54,102
Hi, there.

277
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:55,803
We'd like to go to the Times Square.

278
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,605
We're brothers.

279
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,374
We're all set for the double date tonight.

280
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,844
Vivian's bringing her friend Bernice.

281
00:10:02,845 --> 00:10:04,212
Bernice?

282
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,080
That sounds like a cartoon dump truck.

283
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,915
Whatever, that's probably for the best.

284
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,383
I don't need any distractions.

285
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:10,818
My mission is to protect you.

286
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,053
All right.

287
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:13,287
Hey, this guy's going the right way.

288
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:14,689
We should get out and try again.

289
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,324
You can let us off here.

290
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,030
We would like to buy some bagels.

291
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:24,799
And where is
the sex and the city street?

292
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,434
We wanna see where Carrie and Big live.

293
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:28,169
I'm a Carrie.
I think I'm a Carrie.

294
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,671
We're both Carries.

295
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,774
All right, let's prepare
for the date tonight.

296
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,675
Here's the things you're not
allowed to talk about:

297
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,178
Love, poetry, music, or passion.

298
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,880
We don't have to talk at all.

299
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:40,214
I'll just stare into her eyes.

300
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:42,116
They're like little drops
of cilantro reduction

301
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,851
on lily-white flan.
Okay, no.

302
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,453
See, no food talk.

303
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:47,989
It sets off something primal
and disgusting in both of you.

304
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,357
It makes me wanna barf.

305
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,658
You're right.
Look, if you feel like

306
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,460
you can't handle it, we need a signal.

307
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:53,528
I'll do this.

308
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,299
And how would you do that naturally?

309
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,433
I don't know.

310
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,835
This guy's clean, by the way.

311
00:11:00,836 --> 00:11:02,436
Can we pull over, please?

312
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:04,872
There she is.

313
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,240
I don't know if I can do this.

314
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,708
Listen to me.
I am with you all night.

315
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,010
And nothing will distract me

316
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:11,179
from my solemn vow to protect you, okay?

317
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,280
Okay.

318
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:13,781
Vivian, you look beautiful.

319
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:15,316
I love your dress.
Aww.

320
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:17,652
You too, Charlie.
You look so handsome.

321
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:21,155
Steady, steady.

322
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,124
Jake, this is my friend Bernice.

323
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,294
Oh, hello.
I'm jak-tractive.

324
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:27,628
Jak-tractive?

325
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:32,600
Yes, my parents were hippies.

326
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,068
Let's eat.

327
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:38,161
Okay, so, Jake, you're a cop.

328
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:39,962
I wanted to be a cop when I was a kid,

329
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:42,231
mostly because I love Die Hard.

330
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:45,201
Die Hard, really?-

331
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:47,470
Well, that makes sense,
everyone loves that movie.

332
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:48,738
Oh, not like me.

333
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:51,574
I sleep in a Nakatomi Plaza
Security t-shirt.

334
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:53,409
Oh, no.

335
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,877
What kinda dogs do you like?

336
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,579
I mean, you know, just hypothetically,

337
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,080
if we were to get a dog.

338
00:11:58,081 --> 00:11:59,549
Oh, I love all dogs.

339
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,484
When I was a kid, I had the cutest

340
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,753
Golden Retriever, named Rufus.

341
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:05,421
That is the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

342
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:06,789
I wanna meet him.

343
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,891
Charles, why don't you tell Vivian

344
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:10,760
about the ten-day forecast?

345
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:12,028
Oh, good idea.

346
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,162
Sorry about that.

347
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:15,431
So if you're not a cop,
then what do you do?

348
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:16,632
I'm in grad school.

349
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,367
I thought about maybe
being a sports reporter,

350
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:20,937
but it would be impossible
for me to be objective.

351
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,672
I love the Nets so much.

352
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:24,340
You're a Nets fan?
I love the nets.

353
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:27,577
Oh, my God. This season has
been a disaster, right? Yes.

354
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:29,812
- And everybody blames it Jason Kidd.
- Yes.

355
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,647
But it's like, at a certain point,

356
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:33,249
Billy King is the one
who put the team together.

357
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,250
Yes.

358
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:35,418
Wow.

359
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:37,520
I love rainy days.
My mother loves rainy days.

360
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:39,622
You should meet her.

361
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:40,756
Excuse me.

362
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:41,991
Our signal.

363
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:43,559
Here's a question for the group.

364
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,562
What is the longest funeral
you've ever attended?

365
00:12:46,563 --> 00:12:48,030
Ladies first.

366
00:12:48,031 --> 00:12:50,933
On behalf
of captain Holt: Floorgasm.

367
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:55,471
♪ Hands in the air
fist pumpin' like champs ♪

368
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:57,773
♪ hands in the air
fist pumpin' like champs ♪

369
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:00,243
♪ hands in the air
fist pumpin' like champs ♪

370
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:01,644
♪ fist pumpin' like champs

371
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,179
♪ fist pumpin' like champs

372
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:07,483
Did you like it?

373
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:09,952
It was inspired by the city of New York,

374
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:11,887
in that I stole it from some kids

375
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:13,756
I saw dancing on the subway station.

376
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:16,425
All of you, go home, immediately.

377
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:18,794
I appreciate the effort,
Gina, but I can't risk

378
00:13:18,795 --> 00:13:19,962
losing this election.

379
00:13:19,963 --> 00:13:22,031
The AAGLNYCPA means too much.

380
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:23,499
Let me rehearse my speech.

381
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,435
Do you want a president
who struggled against all odds

382
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,271
to create this great organization?

383
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:30,273
Or do you want a great nothing

384
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:33,643
who struggled against
nothing odds to create nothing.

385
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:35,044
Yikes.

386
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,647
The meeting is beginning.

387
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:39,015
The stakes are very high for me.

388
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:40,383
I'm getting nervous.

389
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:45,154
My stomach is in flux.

390
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,889
You know, in the court of Louis XI,

391
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,758
women would only eat consomme, because

392
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,727
they were worried that chewing
would give them wrinkles.

393
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:53,796
I love it when you talk broth.

394
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:55,598
Hey, Charles, remember that dog

395
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,866
we found on the train tracks?

396
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:59,068
Was it inside-out
or just very badly burned?

397
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:00,136
Inside-out.
Yeah, 'cause there were

398
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:01,203
things on the outside that

399
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:02,672
definitely should've been on the inside.

400
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:03,839
Definition of inside-out.

401
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,741
Bingo.
Will you excuse us?

402
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:07,943
Bernice and I are gonna
use the ladies' room. Yeah.

403
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:11,180
Hurry back.
Oh, no.

404
00:14:11,181 --> 00:14:12,815
Jake, I can't stop looking at her butt.

405
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,750
Yeah, you are definitely
making her uncomfortable.

406
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:16,419
And this beautiful
basketball-loving

407
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,688
Die Hard fan is tearing down
my walls of defenses.

408
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:21,657
If we find out that she is
half-Jewish, we are all doomed!

409
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:23,292
I know.
I borrowed the waiter's phone

410
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:24,960
when you weren't looking,
and bought me and Vivian

411
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:26,429
plane tickets to Rome.
What?

412
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,797
We leave in two hours.

413
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:29,598
Terrible itinerary,
connect through Vietnam.

414
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,267
All right, just go home.
Get out of here and regroup.

415
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:32,601
I'll take care of everything.

416
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:34,804
I'll tell 'em it was
an emergency. Thank you.

417
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,906
Can you make it a work
emergency, not a bathroom one?

418
00:14:36,907 --> 00:14:38,007
I kinda wanna make it a bathroom one.

419
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,210
Sarge, you made your point.

420
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:42,244
We messed up.

421
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:43,612
But this is a big case, and Hitchcock

422
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:45,081
and Scully are gonna screw it up.

423
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:46,415
I'm sure they can handle it.

424
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,818
They have a combined
50 years of experience.

425
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:50,486
This morning I found Scully's gun

426
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:52,555
in the freezer, in the frozen yogurt.

427
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,390
I think he was using it as a spoon.

428
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:57,093
The truth is, I had to give 'em the case.

429
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,828
You insulted Super Dan.

430
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:01,030
He refuses to cooperate with you.

431
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:02,298
We weren't that bad.

432
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,133
You told him his superpower
was being so embarrassing

433
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:06,035
that people laughed themselves to death.

434
00:15:06,036 --> 00:15:07,703
Yeah.

435
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:10,406
For those of you who don't know me,

436
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:11,874
I'm officer Brian Jensen.

437
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,677
Listen to him talk.

438
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,845
He has no gravitas.

439
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:18,414
Do you know what gravitas sounds like?

440
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:21,150
Greetings, all.

441
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:23,285
Details about this organization

442
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:25,721
should be included
in NYPD recruitment literature

443
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:27,423
and on the website.

444
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,458
He actually has some good ideas.

445
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,894
Maybe you shouldn't be
so quick to dismiss him,

446
00:15:31,895 --> 00:15:34,530
like you were with a certain
amazing dance troop.

447
00:15:34,531 --> 00:15:35,898
He isn't fit to be president.

448
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,633
He hasn't spent the last 25 years

449
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,301
fighting to build this organization.

450
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:40,603
Right. Is that bad?

451
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:44,774
I thought you created
agla... naca... macapa

452
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,709
or whatever, so people like him

453
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,778
wouldn't have to go through
what you went through.

454
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,846
Isn't it a good thing that Brian Jensen

455
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:53,616
didn't have to struggle for 25 years

456
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:55,418
just to get up on this stage?

457
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:57,653
Thank you all for your time.

458
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:58,954
I hope you vote for me.

459
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,729
Greetings, all.

460
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,063
You know what the toughest part about

461
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,800
being a gay black police officer is?

462
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:12,067
The discrimination.

463
00:16:14,604 --> 00:16:15,971
What?

464
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:18,374
At the very first meeting
of the AAGLNYCPA,

465
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,676
I was elected president unanimously,

466
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:23,412
because I was the only member
and I voted for myself.

467
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:26,348
But after 25 years of struggle,

468
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,551
I am no longer the only member.

469
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,821
And I look forward to casting
my vote for someone else.

470
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,589
That is why I withdraw my name

471
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,826
from consideration as president.

472
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,994
Congratulations, Brian.

473
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,733
If you screw this up, I will impeach you.

474
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:47,169
I wrote the bylaws,
so I know how to do it.

475
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,206
But I'm very happy for you.

476
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,209
But I will impeach you, if necessary.

477
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:57,680
Anyways, Charles wanted me to
reiterate how sorry he is,

478
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,315
but he got an emergency call.

479
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,817
And that is plausible,
because we're detectives.

480
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,052
Well, is it a tough case?

481
00:17:03,053 --> 00:17:05,020
'Cause Charlie was acting
so weird tonight.

482
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:08,190
Work has been
so stressful.

483
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:10,726
Speaking of, here is your coat.

484
00:17:10,727 --> 00:17:12,094
I've gotta run.

485
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:13,496
If you wouldn't mind using the back exit,

486
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:14,730
it'll be much safer.
Trust me.

487
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:17,666
I'm a cop. New York, right?

488
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,903
Charles, what are you doing here?

489
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:22,571
I'm so close to getting you out of this.

490
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:24,340
They're putting their coats on.
Funny story...

491
00:17:24,341 --> 00:17:25,908
I was walking home
and I passed a pawn shop.

492
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:27,243
And then I went into a trance.

493
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:28,511
And now I have this engagement ring.

494
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,246
No, Charles!
Well,

495
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,181
I'm gonna go ask Vivian
to marry me. Bye.

496
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:34,049
No, give me that.
Jake!

497
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,050
Give that back.

498
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,285
I'm doing this for your own good.

499
00:17:36,286 --> 00:17:38,153
You've gone full Boyle.
I'm helping you out.

500
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:39,755
Give me that ring,
or I'm gonna pepper spray you.

501
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:43,225
Pepper spray me, I will pepper spray you!

502
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:46,595
No!

503
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:53,702
Aah!

504
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:56,105
Crap! Crap! Aah, crap!
Crap! Aw, crap!

505
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:01,598
Hey, buddy.

506
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,367
Got you that fancy coffee you like.

507
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:04,501
Nah, I don't want it.

508
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:06,236
So expensive.

509
00:18:06,237 --> 00:18:07,404
How you holding up?

510
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:08,973
Well, Jake, I've been better.

511
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:10,641
Right. Look, I'm sorry

512
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:12,476
I threw your ring
in that boiling pork water.

513
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:14,778
Yeah. I'm sorry
I pepper sprayed you.

514
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:16,347
I'm sorry I pepper sprayed you.

515
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:18,015
It burned like hell, right?
Yeah.

516
00:18:18,016 --> 00:18:19,083
Thank God for that soda.

517
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,489
It's so sticky, but it feels so good.

518
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,057
Ooh, cab.

519
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:30,260
After you.
Yes, sir.

520
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,664
What are you two still doing here?

521
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:34,865
Isn't your shift over?

522
00:18:34,866 --> 00:18:36,367
There's something we need to take care of.

523
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:39,403
Oh, Super Dan, over here.
Thanks for coming.

524
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:40,938
Great.

525
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,106
You two?

526
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:43,374
If you guys wanna make fun of me,

527
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,876
just come down to pita paradise
like everyone else does.

528
00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:47,277
We need your help.
Why?

529
00:18:47,278 --> 00:18:48,579
What happened to Scully and Hitchcock?

530
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,682
They're busy, cleaning Hitchcock's ear.

531
00:18:51,683 --> 00:18:56,086
Yeah. Did you witness any of
these men selling narcotics?

532
00:18:56,087 --> 00:18:58,055
This is so official.

533
00:18:58,056 --> 00:19:00,724
Yeah, this guy, number three.

534
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,092
That's the mope we brought in.

535
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:03,961
Yeah, okay.

536
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:05,596
We're gonna need to take your statement.

537
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:07,631
Spare no detail.
Really?

538
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,233
Yeah!

539
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:12,269
Okay, um, all right.

540
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,538
Well, I was driving
around my neighborhood

541
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,640
in the "Danmobile," which is my bike.

542
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:19,043
I know what we did wrong.

543
00:19:19,044 --> 00:19:20,978
Should've followed the rules,

544
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:23,247
but more importantly, we're supposed

545
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:25,349
to help out everyone, no matter what.

546
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,750
That's right.

547
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:28,519
Nice work on the arrest.

548
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,289
I got vaccinated that year,
but then I still got the flu.

549
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,258
Whoa.

550
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,793
Don't be bummed, man.

551
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:37,961
It's gonna be okay.
No, it isn't.

552
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:40,164
You can't be with me
every minute of every day.

553
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,066
I'm in love with this woman, for real.

554
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:44,168
And I'm gonna go full Boyle
and scare her off.

555
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,336
No, we can figure this out, all right?

556
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:47,971
I still got your phone,
so you're good there...

557
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:49,039
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

558
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,774
I think we're gonna get robbed.

559
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:51,975
I need to pull over.

560
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:55,345
Flat tire.

561
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,613
Give me your wallets.

562
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:58,749
NYPD, you're under arrest
for armed robbery!

563
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,150
A little to the left, Charles.

564
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:03,187
Yeah, I'm still not seeing great
because of the pepper spray.

565
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:07,424
Hey, cab driver's
in the interrogation room.

566
00:20:07,425 --> 00:20:10,094
You ready?
Let's do it.

567
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,196
Oh, no, what's this?

568
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:14,331
What is this?

569
00:20:14,332 --> 00:20:15,432
I checked your phone.

570
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:17,534
There were a hundred texts from
Vivian, worried about you,

571
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,704
a selfie that I can never unsee,
and dozens of voice mails.

572
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:23,640
Hey, Chucklebunny, it's me.

573
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:24,675
You disappeared last night.

574
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:26,310
And you were acting weird.

575
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:28,278
And I'm worried it's
because I'm moving too fast.

576
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,047
I really wanna see you.

577
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:31,215
And I know it's 3:00 A.M.,

578
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:32,783
but we should feed each other falafel

579
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,251
in our underwear...
Okay.

580
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:36,587
I know it when I hear it.

581
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:37,855
She's full Boyle.

582
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:39,089
Full Boyle for Boyle.

583
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,557
I took the liberty of texting her,

584
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:42,025
and telling her to come meet you here.

585
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:44,394
I thought you might wanna give her this,

586
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,396
or something considerably nicer.

587
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:47,731
That is definitely not platinum.

588
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:49,399
You really think this is a good idea?

589
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,868
Buddy, I honestly don't know,

590
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:52,803
but you're definitely
not gonna scare her off.

591
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:54,805
I say do whatever makes you happiest.

592
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:55,906
Jakey, you're the best.

593
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,376
Your body is trembling like a leaf.

594
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:02,679
I'm so excited.

595
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,047
Yes! Yes?

596
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:05,382
Yes!

597
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,717
Aww.

598
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:09,453
Charles is engaged.

599
00:21:09,454 --> 00:21:11,755
You handled this really well, Peralta.

600
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:14,091
I take back what I said
about you being immature.

601
00:21:14,092 --> 00:21:16,693
Oh, apology accepted, fart monster.

602
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:18,729
Okay.

603
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,063
Oh, no.

604
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:21,298
Oh, boy.
Okay.

605
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:23,400
Yeah, this is turning into
a live sex show.

606
00:21:23,401 --> 00:21:24,768
Yeah, let's go.
Oh, no.

607
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,036
I wasn't saying it in a bad way.

608
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:27,271
Jake!
Yep.

609
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:30,507
Although they can't see us.

610
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:31,775
- Jake!
- Yep.

611
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,276
