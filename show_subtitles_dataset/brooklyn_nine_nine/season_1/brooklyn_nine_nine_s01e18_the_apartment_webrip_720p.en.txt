1
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:05,774
So, again, your alibi is
a mysterious stranger

2
00:00:05,776 --> 00:00:08,510
handed you the gun,
made you put your prints on it,

3
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:10,612
robbed the store,
and then hid the gun

4
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:11,813
in your underpants.

5
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:13,014
Well, yeah, if you say it
like that,

6
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:14,416
it don't sound believable.

7
00:00:14,418 --> 00:00:15,750
Oh, hey, captain.

8
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:17,319
Did you get my report
on the Finley murder?

9
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,687
Yeah, I looked it over.
Nice work.

10
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:22,557
Good. Thanks, dad.

11
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,492
Why is everyone
staring at me?

12
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:26,428
You just called
captain Holt "dad."

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,331
What? No, I didn't.
I said, "thanks, man."

14
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,032
Do you see me as
a father figure, Peralta?

15
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:32,934
No. If anything, I see you

16
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:34,035
as a "bother" figure,

17
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:35,570
'cause you're always
bothering me.

18
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,706
Hey, show your father
some respect.

19
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,374
I didn't call him dad.

20
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:40,942
No, no, no, no, Jacob.

21
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,344
I take it as a compliment.

22
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,980
I called Vivian "mom" once,
and she's my fiancee.

23
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:47,549
Guys, jump on that!

24
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:49,084
Boyle has
psycho-sexual issues.

25
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:50,485
Old news.

26
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,454
But you calling Holt "daddy"--

27
00:00:52,456 --> 00:00:54,589
hey, "daddy" is not
on the table here.

28
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:56,658
But you did call him
"dad," dude.

29
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,528
All right, all right,
I was lying about the holdup.

30
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,030
But the dad thing,
that happened.

31
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:03,732
Aha!

32
00:01:03,734 --> 00:01:05,066
He admitted that his alibi
was a lie.

33
00:01:05,068 --> 00:01:09,571
It was a trap, all part
of my crazy, devious plan.

34
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:11,005
I believe you.
Thank you.

35
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,574
Son.

36
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:13,808
Do you want to talk
about it later

37
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,878
over a game of catch?

38
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,846
I'd like that.

39
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:40,602
Thank you for coming in
on your day off.

40
00:01:40,604 --> 00:01:41,736
I know you'd all rather be
at home,

41
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:43,538
binge watching media content.

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,607
Oh! I just started
the second season

43
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:46,674
of media content.

44
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:47,876
No spoilers.

45
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:50,078
But these evaluations
are important.

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,547
Sir, I think I speak
for all of us...

47
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:53,748
She doesn't.

48
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,784
When I say that we can't wait

49
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:57,585
for you to sit
in judgment of us.

50
00:01:57,587 --> 00:02:00,121
Oh, these will be
self-evaluations, Santiago.

51
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:02,624
Why... Se.

52
00:02:02,626 --> 00:02:04,626
Very wise, sir.

53
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:05,627
Nice save.

54
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:06,728
Also, please stay
out of the way

55
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,962
of the weekend squad.

56
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:10,432
They are on duty,
and the bullpen is theirs.

57
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:12,467
I hate the weekend squad.

58
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:14,002
Detective lohank
shaves at my desk

59
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:15,170
and gets hair
all over my computer.

60
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:17,038
My "r" key
is jammed with stubble.

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,673
Well, that explains
the email you sent

62
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:20,975
about the "guesome mude."

63
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,644
Dismissed.

64
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:24,813
I'm pumped for these
evaluations, sir.

65
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,115
I can't wait to hear what you
have to say about my squad.

66
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:28,850
I think they've had
a great year.

67
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,785
I feel like
a proud mama hen

68
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,987
whose baby chicks
have learned to fly.

69
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:34,522
Interesting analogy,
sergeant.

70
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:37,058
Chickens are famously bad
at flying.

71
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,092
Yo.

72
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:39,727
Peralta asked to be first,

73
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:42,163
which shows how seriously
he's begun taking his job.

74
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:43,765
Nope, I just want to get
this over with.

75
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,099
So I have 72 arrests,

76
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:47,535
an 80% clearance rate,

77
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,838
but most importantly,

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,606
I wore a tie sometimes.

79
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:53,808
Now, I have a question
for you:

80
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,244
Is there any way
I can borrow $430,000?

81
00:02:56,246 --> 00:02:58,246
Why on earth do you need
that much money?

82
00:02:58,248 --> 00:02:59,781
I need to buy my apartment.

83
00:02:59,783 --> 00:03:01,182
I've been living
at my Nana's place

84
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:03,084
since she passed away
'cause it's rent-controlled,

85
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:04,719
but now the building's
going co-op,

86
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,054
so I have to buy it.

87
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,857
I need to secure a loan
by the end of the day.

88
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:10,925
Uh, so should we do
a wire transfer,

89
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:12,193
or do you think cash
is easier?

90
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:13,528
Let's just do cash.

91
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,596
Shouldn't you be asking
somebody else

92
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:15,730
for that kind of money?

93
00:03:15,732 --> 00:03:16,731
Like a bank?

94
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,900
Yeah, I tried that.

95
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:26,040
Jake, I cannot believe

96
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:27,909
you're gonna lose
Nana's apartment.

97
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,577
We grew up together.
We used to hang out there

98
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:31,012
every day after school.

99
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:33,848
That's right, because there was
no one to look after us,

100
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,551
because our moms
both worked, and...

101
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:38,686
We didn't have fathers

102
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:42,524
Peralta, I will not give you
a cool half mil

103
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:44,559
because you had
a slightly sad childhood.

104
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:46,828
Go solve
your housing crisis.

105
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,600
Nana made me the intelligent,
sensuous woman I am today.

106
00:03:52,602 --> 00:03:54,769
Weird way to describe
a grandma's influence on you.

107
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:55,837
I'm sorry, Gina.

108
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,305
I don't know
that we can spare you.

109
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:59,541
Um, these are her notes
so far.

110
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,643
"Empanadas, Atlantic city,
birth control."

111
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,077
No, that's my travel journal.

112
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,946
I haven't started
on the notes yet.

113
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:06,881
You may go with Peralta.

114
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:08,850
Both: Thank you.

115
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:11,085
I want to take Vivian
somewhere romantic tonight.

116
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:12,287
How about this?

117
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,655
Graziolo's,

118
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:15,857
for the porco digestivo meal.

119
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:19,694
It's a culinary tour
of a pig's digestive track.

120
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,296
Pig bung gelato for two,
anyone?

121
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:22,830
Uh-oh, heads up.

122
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:23,831
Weekend crew.

123
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:30,038
I feel sad for you.

124
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,573
I love my desk buddy.

125
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,074
Sometimes detective kearns
and I leave presents

126
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:35,677
for each other.

127
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,946
Well, lohank's
a stubble monkey.

128
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:39,781
I hate him
and his face garbage.

129
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:41,683
Why don't you just tell him
to stop shaving at his desk?

130
00:04:41,685 --> 00:04:44,185
He denies even doing it.
I don't know why.

131
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:45,587
Next time I catch him shaving,

132
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:46,588
I'm gonna punch him
so hard in the mouth

133
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,157
he bites his own heart.

134
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,025
Could that be why
he denies doing it?

135
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:54,062
Oh, yeah, you could be right.
Yeah.

136
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,897
Oh, wow.

137
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:59,033
It is always so crazy
coming back here.

138
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,602
Remember when Nana got cable?

139
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:03,705
We watched house party 2
so many times.

140
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:05,807
It was a pajama-jamma-jam.
We had no choice.

141
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,308
Our hands were tied.
I gotta say,

142
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,344
I'm psyched to be hanging
like this, old-school stylez.

143
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:10,778
"Stylez" with a "z".

144
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,680
Oh, I could tell.

145
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,248
Okay, well, maybe we can
figure out a way for you

146
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,650
to afford this place.

147
00:05:15,652 --> 00:05:19,120
Hup, hup, before we get
all financial,

148
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:21,823
can I interest you
in an ice-cold foh-dy?

149
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:24,659
A'ight.

150
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:26,628
So talk to me, goose.
How we lookin'?

151
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,796
Sexy, but not like
we're trying too hard.

152
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:29,897
Like, sure, we're trying,

153
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,766
but it's almost effortless.

154
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:32,800
Yeah, no,
I knew all of that.

155
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:33,801
I meant the money thing.

156
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:35,703
Oh. My first impression

157
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:39,007
is that you have a debilitating
spending problem.

158
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,709
Jake, you have
six massage chairs.

159
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,211
Well, they don't make
a massage couch.

160
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:46,014
Okay, but you also have
three turntables.

161
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:48,650
Ooh, yeah!
I'm learning how to spin.

162
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,118
Check it out.

163
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:55,823
All I have are my grandma's
old klezmer records,

164
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:57,258
and I still haven't
quite figured out

165
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,327
how to sync up the beats,
but it's not bad, right?

166
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:03,698
It sounds like joy behar
falling down some stairs.

167
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,400
Okay, you also purchased

168
00:06:05,402 --> 00:06:09,103
Olympus has fallen
on demand 12 times.

169
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,706
Was it a difficult movie
for you to follow?

170
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,041
No, just watched it a lot.

171
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:16,811
How much do I have to cut back
in order to keep this place?

172
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:19,681
Infinity percent.

173
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:22,016
Technically speaking,
you're bankrupt, kiddo.

174
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,351
That sounds bad.

175
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:26,988
I only said "kiddo"
to soften the blow, kiddo.

176
00:06:30,826 --> 00:06:32,026
This is so unfair.

177
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:35,096
And then all of the sudden,
they decide they're going co-op

178
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:36,064
with zero warning?

179
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,231
It seems illegal

180
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:38,966
they didn't tell you
this was happening.

181
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,301
Well, it's possible
I missed a letter,

182
00:06:40,303 --> 00:06:41,335
but I doubt it.

183
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:43,037
Ooh, let's check
the mail tub.

184
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,205
Mail tub?

185
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,707
Nope. No.

186
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,041
No.

187
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:49,744
See? It's impossible
to find anything in here.

188
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:50,978
It's not my fault.

189
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,180
This is actually
a cool little bathroom.

190
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:53,948
Nice claw-foot tub.

191
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,317
Which I will never throw
my mail into again.

192
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,119
Unless...

193
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:59,921
I didn't want to do this,
but I do know one way

194
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:00,922
we could get the money.

195
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:02,490
You'd make
a decent prostitute.

196
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:04,325
I'd make an amazing prostitute.

197
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:07,028
But I was actually talking
about this guy I know, Frank.

198
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,997
He's kinda skeevy, but he will
loan money to anybody.

199
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:11,466
So he's a loan shark.

200
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,101
Maybe you're not
thinking this through.

201
00:07:13,103 --> 00:07:15,436
Says the woman who's been
engaged eight times.

202
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:17,305
Uh, but never married once.

203
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:19,107
Game, set, match—linetti.

204
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:21,109
Well, it's the only choice
I have.

205
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:23,211
So let's go.

206
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:26,180
Sir, I know we got off
to a weird start,

207
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:27,949
so to get things
back on track,

208
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:30,218
I'd like to bring in
Santiago next.

209
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,419
She's had a great year.

210
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:32,854
You wanted
to see me, sirs?

211
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:34,021
I was reading
the sergeant's lips

212
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:35,123
through the window,
and he either said,

213
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,958
"bring in Santiago next,"

214
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
or something
about a San Diego nest.

215
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:41,295
Are you ready
for your self-evaluation?

216
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:43,931
I am.

217
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,834
I understand from a lip-reading
session last week

218
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:50,004
that you intend to ask us
each ten questions.

219
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:55,243
But for you, I have
just one question.

220
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:57,111
What is your biggest...

221
00:07:57,113 --> 00:07:59,547
Flaw?

222
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:01,949
My biggest flaw?

223
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:05,787
Working too hard?

224
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:08,256
Being too thorough?

225
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:11,392
Caring too much?

226
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:12,794
Got it.

227
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,929
Something entirely different.

228
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:18,399
Rosa, look!

229
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:19,801
Lohank is shaving
right now.

230
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:37,585
Both, in slow-motion: Noooo!

231
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:39,086
Boyle, call an ambulance.

232
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:40,254
I'm gonna do
some stuff to him.

233
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:43,090
Or we give him a taste
of his own medicine.

234
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:44,225
We fill his locker
with shaving cream

235
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,260
and loose hair.

236
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:47,562
I like it.

237
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,463
I cannot believe
I am considering

238
00:08:49,465 --> 00:08:50,998
a non-violent option.

239
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,001
And I know just where to get
a bundle of loose hair.

240
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:56,404
How much interest
do you charge?

241
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:58,039
Look, I'm not a bank.

242
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,307
It's my own personal money.

243
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,609
So I take a larger vig.

244
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:02,844
20 points.

245
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,212
A "vig." So cool.

246
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:05,880
Well, I don't need much.

247
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:08,149
Just, like, $430,000.

248
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:09,350
Nah, too much.

249
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:13,120
I make small loans
to desperate losers.

250
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:15,122
And friends, like you.

251
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,490
Well, I'm happy
this went terribly.

252
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:19,093
Uh, we do have to go now,
so please excuse us.

253
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,562
Wait, I just need enough
to show the co-op board

254
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:23,164
I can make a down payment
at the bank.

255
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,866
How about $20,000?

256
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,434
Two bags of ziti?

257
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,002
That I can do.

258
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:29,871
"Bags of ziti?"

259
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,572
Come on, Gina,
how awesome is that?

260
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:32,874
Get on board.

261
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,876
Come on, Gina.
Get on board.

262
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:37,044
Jake, he is a sea witch
in disguise.

263
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:38,880
Do not sing into his shell.

264
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,282
I have no idea what you're
talking about right now.

265
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:42,984
Oh, little mermaid.

266
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:44,919
What have you done?

267
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:47,622
Oh, yeah.

268
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:49,156
Wow.

269
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:51,359
Nothing gets you smiling
like cold-blooded vengeance.

270
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:57,331
And now,
the piece de resistance.

271
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,233
Emilio's giant bag of hair.

272
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:03,371
Oh, this is disgusting.

273
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:04,405
It's perfect.

274
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:05,539
Ugh.
Ugh.

275
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,409
Ooh, check—check this out.

276
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:13,447
I'm tom Selleck.
Park my chopper on the beach.

277
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:18,052
I'm a Billy goat.

278
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:22,256
Oh!

279
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:25,026
Oh, I think I swallowed
a bunch of stranger hair.

280
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:26,227
Ugh!

281
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:27,628
Hey.

282
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,597
Mr. henders,
the king of the lobby.

283
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:32,500
Jake, the co-op board meeting
was an hour ago.

284
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,335
I know.
I am so sorry.

285
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:37,371
It's just I've been pretty busy
with police work, you know,

286
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,140
with my police friends,

287
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:41,943
helping out non-police folk
such as yourself,

288
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:43,945
keeping you safe police.

289
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:44,946
We appreciate your service.

290
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:48,015
Look, I know there's been
a lot of misconceptions

291
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,350
about my financial situation,

292
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:52,119
but I am ready to put that
to rest right now.

293
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:53,955
Boom goes the dynamite.
Oh, my God.

294
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:55,623
That's $20,000 right there,

295
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,092
and I intend to use it
as a down payment on a mortgage.

296
00:10:58,094 --> 00:10:59,260
Where did you get this money?

297
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,328
Just had it lying around.

298
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,996
You've been
an adequate tenant.

299
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,698
Adequate.
But we needed
a completed application

300
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,266
with a bank loan by today.

301
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:07,401
With all due respect, sir,
that's not fair.

302
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:08,669
I mean, I didn't even know
that the building

303
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,137
was going co-op
until last week.

304
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:11,172
I got one letter.

305
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,074
We left you 15 voicemails
as well.

306
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:14,675
Ah, voicemails.
Well, that explains it.

307
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:17,078
My generation mostly texts.

308
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,713
I'm only 33, so—

309
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:20,247
we're in the same generation.
I'm 31.

310
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:21,649
31?
Mm-hmm.

311
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:23,117
But I call you "mister."

312
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:26,087
And you wear a suit, and...

313
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,455
That.

314
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,190
Did you just point
at my bald spot?

315
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:30,458
No.
Look.

316
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,126
We're putting the apartment
on the market.

317
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:34,061
We need to get it ready
for brokers to show.

318
00:11:34,063 --> 00:11:35,663
We need you out
by next Friday.

319
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:37,999
Ohhh, next Friday's
a little tough for me.

320
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,400
Is there any way
we could move it

321
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:41,669
to the Sunday after
eight years from next Friday?

322
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:44,538
Based on your judge-y eyes,

323
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,408
I am going to take back
my dynamite.

324
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,176
Un-boom.

325
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:52,213
You got a full head—
head of hair.

326
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:54,148
Nope.
Okay.

327
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:00,454
Aw, that bad?

328
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:02,056
I'm gonna be homeless.

329
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:03,491
A homeless cop.

330
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:04,625
It's like a made-for-TV movie

331
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:05,793
that I will not be able
to watch

332
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,261
because I won't have
a television

333
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:08,429
because I'll be homeless.

334
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:10,131
Chin up, lil' pup.

335
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,599
First of all, you could
watch it on your phone.

336
00:12:11,601 --> 00:12:14,735
Second, this isn't the only
apartment in the city.

337
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:16,103
We'll find you a new one.

338
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:18,272
You're right.

339
00:12:18,274 --> 00:12:19,507
You're right.
This could be good.

340
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,175
I mean, maybe we'll find
a great place.

341
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:23,210
Atta girl.
In a cooler neighborhood.

342
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:24,311
That's right, girl.

343
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:25,646
Maybe I'll even have
a cute neighbor.

344
00:12:25,648 --> 00:12:27,148
Get it, girl.

345
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,416
You gotta stop
calling me girl.

346
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,684
Sorry, girl.

347
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:32,219
Okay, sirs.

348
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:34,688
I know why you weren't happy
with my self-evaluation.

349
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,057
You didn't want me
to say a flaw

350
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,458
that was actually positive,

351
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,293
like how the sergeant
always says it's bad

352
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,628
that he works out too much.

353
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,530
Whoa. Why the drive-by?

354
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:43,531
Sorry.

355
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,232
But that's not right,

356
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:48,769
because you value honesty
and humility above all else.

357
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:50,671
So what's your biggest flaw?

358
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:52,506
My biggest flaw.

359
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:54,341
I'm too competitive,
prone to jealousy,

360
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:55,810
"bit of a killjoy,

361
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,211
"follow rules to a fault,

362
00:12:57,213 --> 00:13:02,516
and every now and then,
I smoke a cigarette."

363
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:03,851
Is that what
you're looking for?

364
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:05,519
Because I can keep going.

365
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:06,620
I am deeply flawed.

366
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:08,756
Santiago—
oh, no.

367
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:10,524
"Santiago" in "b" flat.

368
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:11,425
You're disappointed.

369
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,094
Okay, well,

370
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,829
I'm going to go
to a secret location

371
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:16,397
and make sure that nobody
is smoking there.

372
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,798
I'll be right back.

373
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,534
Is this a pre-war?

374
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,702
Ah, very good eye.

375
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:23,704
And you should know
it's also pet-friendly.

376
00:13:23,706 --> 00:13:26,507
Really?
Do they allow cats?

377
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:28,542
I can't tell if you're
being sarcastic.

378
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:34,115
How would you even
get a bed in here?

379
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:36,283
Oh, Murphy bed.

380
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:37,284
Voila.

381
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:38,486
Nope.

382
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:40,187
This is kinda cool.

383
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,789
High ceilings,
so many windows.

384
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,390
Gina, the toilet is

385
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:46,227
in the middle
of the living room.

386
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:47,394
I think it's sexy.

387
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:51,132
Aah!

388
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,533
So when's this going down?

389
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:54,201
Well, normally, Lohan hits
the locker room

390
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:55,469
when he goes to the gym,

391
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:58,272
so let's see when he plans
on working out.

392
00:13:58,274 --> 00:13:59,874
So, Lohan,
I was reading an article

393
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,542
about the benefits
of exercise—

394
00:14:01,544 --> 00:14:02,843
you going to the gym today?

395
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:04,445
Not today. Been spending
all my breaks on the phone

396
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:06,280
with my wife, Nancy.

397
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:07,882
We've been having
marital problems.

398
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:09,450
Right, 'cause of your hygiene?

399
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:12,319
What? No, I wish.

400
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:14,221
No, about a year ago,
she fell down the stairs

401
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:15,523
and broke her back.

402
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:18,259
Now she's addicted
to painkillers.

403
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:19,593
We've been fighting a lot.
Mm.

404
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:21,862
'Cause I want to help her,
you know?

405
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:24,532
I guess I just love her
so much.

406
00:14:24,534 --> 00:14:26,200
But she's refusing treatment.

407
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:27,468
Ohhh.

408
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,669
We got into it again
last night.

409
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:30,905
I went out
for some fresh air,

410
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,506
but I forgot
to close the door,

411
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:33,908
and our dog cinnamon
got out.

412
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,276
Oh, no.

413
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,378
Cinnamon got hit
by a drunk driver.

414
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,612
I wish I could say

415
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:40,414
she was put out of her misery
instantly,

416
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,683
but the vet assured us
that her suffering

417
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:45,486
was unending and terrible.

418
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:48,489
Just venting a little.
I-I appreciate—

419
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,658
of course.

420
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,259
Anything for a good friend
like you.

421
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:53,594
Charles, can I see you
for a minute?

422
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:55,196
Yep.

423
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:56,830
My first question is,

424
00:14:56,832 --> 00:15:00,434
why are the two of you doing
this self-evaluation together?

425
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:02,536
Scully doesn't handle
pressure well.

426
00:15:02,538 --> 00:15:04,438
Um...

427
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,639
Um...
Not to brag,

428
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:07,508
but Scully and I have
a combined total

429
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,611
of 14 arrests.

430
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,580
Would've been 20,
but we only got 14.

431
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:13,647
That's not enough arrests.

432
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,549
Well, no one asked you.

433
00:15:15,551 --> 00:15:16,817
It's a self-evaluation.

434
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:19,920
Come on, Scully.

435
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:23,891
I'm trying to hurry,

436
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:25,526
but when you grab the hair,
it breaks apart.

437
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:27,861
The key is you use your hands
like scoopers.

438
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:29,830
Just go—

439
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:34,702
I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for this, sir.

440
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:37,571
Uh, we accidentally dropped
all our loose hair

441
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:38,772
and shaving cream
in this locker,

442
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:39,940
so we're cleaning it out.

443
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,742
Hasn't detective Lohan
been through enough?

444
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:44,378
He just got diagnosed
with prostate cancer.

445
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,379
Course he did.

446
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,514
Clean this up. Now.

447
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:50,618
Yes, sir.

448
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:54,388
What's wrong with you guys?

449
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,258
I've lost control
of my squad.

450
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,726
Should we turn some lights on?

451
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:00,494
Trying to save
electricity, Gina.

452
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:02,396
Your massage chair is on.

453
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:04,598
Yeah, I'm poor.
I'm not a savage.

454
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,300
Man, what am I gonna do?

455
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:08,269
Well, what if I bought
the apartment?

456
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,503
What are you talking about?

457
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,472
And then I could rent it
to you till you find

458
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:12,539
a new place.

459
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,608
How could you afford
this place?

460
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,876
Have you been
dealing drugs?

461
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:17,544
No, I'm thrifty.

462
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:19,647
I cut my own hair.
I walk to work.

463
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:21,382
I eat Scully's lunch
every day.

464
00:16:21,384 --> 00:16:24,551
I've rented the same
crap box since I was 20

465
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:25,919
'cause it's so cheap.

466
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,388
I've saved up money,

467
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,423
and I'm looking for
a real estate opportunity.

468
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:31,525
Ew. A real estate
opportunity?

469
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:32,793
Are you being serious?

470
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,495
We were drinking 40's
this morning.

471
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,397
I'm saying I could
give you a fair rent

472
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,865
because I would be
your landlady.

473
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:40,534
Whoa, whoa,
you be my landlady?

474
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:41,402
You're Gina.

475
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:42,469
Your lifelong dream

476
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:43,737
is to be on wife swap.

477
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,439
You call gum "the dentist."

478
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:47,374
You think ray j
is a national treasure.

479
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,476
Yeah, so what?
I'm eclectic.

480
00:16:49,478 --> 00:16:51,779
You're not better
than me, okay?

481
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,847
And I'm glad
that I still own this place

482
00:16:53,849 --> 00:16:56,517
because I can happily
invite you to leave.

483
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,952
Grow up, Jake.

484
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:00,454
"Grow up, Jake."

485
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:01,455
Oh, my goodness.

486
00:17:01,457 --> 00:17:03,691
Yeah, thanks for your help.

487
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:05,492
Old-school styles.

488
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:07,328
I take back the "z"!

489
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:12,466
Whoa, you okay?

490
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:13,567
Yep.

491
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,837
Just checking out
my new bedroom.

492
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,771
Oh, good.

493
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:19,106
It feels like scoliosis

494
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:21,041
and smells like
10 million butts.

495
00:17:21,043 --> 00:17:23,043
I take it your apartment thing
didn't work out.

496
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,012
When did everyone decide
to become an adult?

497
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:26,647
I mean, I know you were born
in your fifties,

498
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:27,648
but come on.

499
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,649
Thanks?

500
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:29,883
Get this.

501
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:31,585
Gina just offered
to buy Nana's apartment

502
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:33,120
as a real estate opportunity

503
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:34,788
and become my "landlady."

504
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,956
Jake—
I know.

505
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,491
She was just trying
to help,

506
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:38,659
but we've known each other
since we were kids,

507
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:39,660
you know?

508
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:42,963
Which an ice cream cone
could do, by the way.

509
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:44,998
And now I find out she's been
saving all these years?

510
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,734
Jake—
I know.

511
00:17:46,736 --> 00:17:48,035
The person that I'm
really mad at is myself

512
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:50,070
for screwing
this whole thing up.

513
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:52,706
I gotta talk to Gina.
Thanks for your help, Amy.

514
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,774
Didn't say anything,
don't want credit

515
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:56,744
yeah, that's smart,
given my track record.

516
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:58,545
Hey, wait.

517
00:17:58,547 --> 00:18:00,781
What would you say Holt
thinks my biggest flaw is?

518
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:01,849
Who care what Holt thinks?

519
00:18:01,851 --> 00:18:03,550
What's most important

520
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:05,386
is what I think
your biggest flaw is.

521
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:06,854
And there are so many
to choose from—

522
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:09,123
too competitive,
prone to jealousy,

523
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,591
bit of a killjoy,

524
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:11,925
your shame cigarettes.

525
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,962
Oh, my God.
But your biggest flaw is...

526
00:18:14,964 --> 00:18:16,997
You suck at throwing away
your secret lists.

527
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:24,104
Although I'm pretty sure
I caught some form of face lice

528
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,406
from that bag of hair.

529
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,874
Being a cop is dangerous.

530
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:30,544
Yeah, it was fun.
Hey, you wanna grab a drink?

531
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:31,845
Oh, shoot, I would,
but I'm meeting Vivian

532
00:18:31,847 --> 00:18:33,480
for that romantic
pig colon dinner.

533
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:35,115
Hey, rosa.

534
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:36,650
I want to apologize.

535
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:38,051
I haven't been much fun
to hang out with

536
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,153
over the last year or so

537
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:40,954
on account of all
the asking you out

538
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:43,824
and staring at you
from point-blank range.

539
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:45,926
Yeah, you were a real weirdo.
Mm-hmm.

540
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:47,094
But you're pretty cool

541
00:18:47,096 --> 00:18:48,896
now that you're in love
with someone else.

542
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:49,797
Have a nice dinner.

543
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,465
Oh, we will.

544
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:52,866
They make a sorbet
out of the tail.

545
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:55,903
See ya.

546
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:58,872
Excuse me, captain.

547
00:18:58,874 --> 00:18:59,873
What are you doing, sergeant?

548
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,475
I'm going to yell at you,

549
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:03,210
and I don't want Santiago
to read my lips.

550
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:04,211
Excuse me?

551
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:06,547
You were completely unfair

552
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:07,548
to my squad today.

553
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,682
Santiago is one

554
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,217
of your best detectives.

555
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:13,554
And all you wanted to do was
play mind games with her.

556
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:15,889
Scully and Hitchcock
only arrested 14 people,

557
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:17,691
but that's 8 more
than last year.

558
00:19:17,693 --> 00:19:19,526
They only arrested
6 people last year?

559
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,994
And I know Peralta
can be childish,

560
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:22,963
but he leads the precinct
in collars,

561
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:25,466
and he's grown up a heck
of a lot since you got here.

562
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:26,967
Okay, sit down, sergeant.

563
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:29,102
I'm going to do
your evaluation now.

564
00:19:32,974 --> 00:19:34,475
Sergeant Jeffords,

565
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:35,642
you're right.

566
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:37,811
I have been hard
on the squad.

567
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:40,714
And just the fact
that you're willing

568
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,850
to stand up for them
is one of the reasons

569
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:44,117
they respect you so much.

570
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,587
I could learn something
from you.

571
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:49,857
You have every right
to feel like, um,

572
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,692
um, what was it
you said this morning?

573
00:19:51,694 --> 00:19:52,960
Proud mama hen, sir.

574
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,795
A proud...

575
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:57,965
Mama hen.

576
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:02,503
What do you want, Jake?

577
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:03,937
I'm watching Oprah's
legends ball,

578
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,806
which is what I do
every time a close friend

579
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:07,007
hurts my feelings.

580
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:10,711
I came here to apologize.

581
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:12,679
Look, I was mad at you

582
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,681
for being more together than me,
and that's not fair.

583
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:15,849
I felt stupid,
so I acted out.

584
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:16,884
I'm sorry.

585
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:18,585
Yeah, you were stupid,

586
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:20,621
and you should be sorry, Jake.

587
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:22,890
But watching Oprah
have brunch

588
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:25,626
with her strong woman friends

589
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:27,561
has taught me that
it's okay to forgive.

590
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:28,695
Great.

591
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:30,197
Also, you should buy
Nana's place.

592
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,298
Not for me.

593
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,866
You should live there.

594
00:20:32,868 --> 00:20:34,601
You love that apartment,
and you said so yourself.

595
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:35,636
It's a great investment.

596
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:36,737
Where are you gonna live?

597
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:37,971
Here.

598
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:38,939
I'll sublet from you.

599
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:40,274
I actually ran the numbers.

600
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:41,808
I'd keep paying
the same amount of rent,

601
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,176
and you would turn
a small profit.

602
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:44,878
It's a starter apartment,
and it's my fault

603
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
for starting when I'm 33.

604
00:20:48,684 --> 00:20:50,017
You have a deal.
All right.

605
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:51,285
Shake, shake.

606
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:52,920
Yes!

607
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:54,988
Hello, detective.

608
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,023
Is there a reason

609
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:57,925
you're interrupting me
mid-soup?

610
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:58,926
Yes.

611
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:02,029
I'm ready for my
self-evaluation.

612
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:03,130
So I asked Peralta

613
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:04,831
what you thought
my biggest flaw was,

614
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,035
and he said, "who cares
what Holt thinks?"

615
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:09,036
That's not surprising.

616
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:10,871
He's very disrespectful.

617
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:13,807
My biggest flaw
is that I care too much

618
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:15,142
what you think of me.

619
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:17,177
I should be more confident
in my own judgment,

620
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,646
and I am so sure of that,

621
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:21,014
I don't even care
if you think I'm right.

622
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:23,050
Evaluation over.

623
00:21:23,052 --> 00:21:25,819
Enjoy your soup.

624
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:33,961
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
