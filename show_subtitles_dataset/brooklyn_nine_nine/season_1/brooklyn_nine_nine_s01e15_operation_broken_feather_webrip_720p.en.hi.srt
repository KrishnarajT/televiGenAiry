But today we face the worst
New York has to offer...

The fire department.

4
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:13,772
Fire marshal Boone, we meet again.

00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:15,674
Detective Peralta, your fly's down.

6
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:17,342
I made you look.
I didn't look.

7
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:19,311
And I'm wearing shorts, there is no fly.

8
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:20,378
That's not what your mom said.

9
00:00:20,379 --> 00:00:21,513
You make no sense.

10
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,148

00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:53,191

98
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:54,325
We need more time.

99
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:55,360
Someone do something.

100
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:57,996

Tear gas.

101
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,801
Scully, Scully,

102
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:04,669
wrap my shirt around your face.

103
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:10,241
And out of the tear gas rises the Phoenix.

104
00:04:11,744 --> 00:04:13,611
Hey, Peralta.

105
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:14,612
I got it from here.

106
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:16,881
All right, fine.

107
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,750
I'll just go then...

108
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:21,319
With this fully signed confession.

109
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,254
We did it, Gus!
Whoo!

110
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:24,589
Suck it, vulture.

111
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,157
I killed that guy and his neighbor,

112
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:27,892
but you were too late.

113
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:31,029
Whoo!
Wait, you killed his neighbor?

114
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,164
Amy, check it out.

115
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:35,667
Nice, you got it framed?
Of course.

116
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:37,535
It commemorates our victory
over the vulture,

117
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:39,470
the greatest day in human history.

118
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:41,039
Sorry the tear gas made you look like

119
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,868
a demon dog at the end of ghostbusters.

120
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,310
Brief me on the hotel robberies.

121
00:04:45,344 --> 00:04:47,545
Helpful hint to the scientists
that programmed you,

122
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:48,680
most humans say "hello"

123
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:50,281
at the beginning of a conversation.

124
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:52,183
Manager at the Prentiss hotel told us that

125
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:53,551
someone's been breaking into the rooms,

126
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:55,320
stolen over $100,000 in jewelry.

127
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:56,688
We're heading over there now.

128
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:59,123
Keep me updated.
Another helpful hint...

129
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:01,893
Good-bye. It's learning.

130
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:03,430
What?

131
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:07,265
Man, an hour of footage,
and we've got nothing.

132
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,936
I have to admit, I do love
a thorough vacuumer.

133
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,536
I'm a little O.C.D.

134
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,405
What? No, you're not.

135
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:15,540
Whoop.

136
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,509
I can leave it there.

137
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,345
Totally.
It doesn't bother me.

138
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:22,146
I know.

139
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,849
There it is.

140
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,551
All right, let's get started.

141
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:28,786
So we have good news,
and we have bad news.

142
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:30,255
My Nana always said, "bad news first,

143
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,423
because the good news
is probably a lie."

144
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:34,559
Fun fact, she made me cry a lot.

145
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:36,160
Good news is, the sting we set up

146
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:37,829
to catch deadbeats went great.

147
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:40,498
Name's Bill Voss,
just got this thing in the mail,

148
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:42,567
said I won a free Bahamas cruise!

149
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:44,068
Congratulations, Bill.

150
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:47,305
You have six outstanding
warrants for credit fraud.

151
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:50,241
Oh, man, can't it wait till
I get back from the Bahamas?

152
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:51,876
I won a cruise.

153
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:53,444
You're not very bright, are you, Bill?

154
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:55,113
Now I know you'd all prefer
to go to a bar,

155
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:58,116
drink beer, and eat chips
of various textures.

156
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,585
But our compstat numbers
are due tomorrow morning,

157
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:04,689
so I need these arrests
on the books today.

158
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,624
Darn it. I had
a belly dancing class.

159
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,393
Tonight was Egyptian undulation.

160
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:10,061
Oh, show us some moves.

161
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:12,563
Sure. Dismissed.

162
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,735
First batch of arrest files
is done-zo Washington.

163
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,970
There's only three files here.

164
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:20,772
It's been an hour.
Yeah, I know.

165
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:22,717
It has not been a productive morning.

166
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:24,208
For example, somebody

167
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,137
used the toaster in front of Boyle.

168
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:28,348
No. No, no, no, no.
Tommy?

169
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,715
And then Boyle spent 30 minutes

170
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:34,552
lecturing him on how to make a sandwich.

171
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:36,154
I'd describe the work flow today

172
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:39,424
as dismal with a tiny,
little splash of pathetic.

173
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:42,946
Get me out of here, man.

174
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,595
I'm worried.

175
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:46,097
The compstat numbers are due
tomorrow at 9:00 A.M.,

176
00:06:46,098 --> 00:06:47,932
but at this rate, we won't be finished

177
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,953
until your daughters
are grown and married.

178
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,135
I may have a solution.

179
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,538
We need to compstat the office.

180
00:06:53,572 --> 00:06:54,605
What is compstat?

181
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,007
It's just using data

182
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,576
to identify problem spots
in the neighborhood.

183
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,412
Now, I have been taking notes

184
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:04,384
on points of friction
in this office for years.

185
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,352
The red areas are places
where no work gets done.

186
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:09,253
If we can fix these problems

187
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,522
without anyone knowing what we're doing,

188
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:13,393
we will finish on time.

189
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:15,526
Are you saying you want
to secretly perform

190
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:17,428
scientific experiments on your friends

191
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,164
and coworkers to increase efficiency?

192
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,533
Yes.

193
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:24,469
Sounds fun, let's do it.

194
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,771
Hey, hand me some peanuts.
I'm snacky.

195
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,673
I have something I need
to talk to you about.

196
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:31,676
I might get a promotion to major crimes.

197
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:34,012
They asked me to come in
and interview for a job.

198
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,580
What?

199
00:07:35,614 --> 00:07:37,248
You're gonna go work for the vulture?

200
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:39,150
Have you forgotten how awful he is?

201
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,547
The Vladimir putin collection?

202
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:44,355
Yeah, 70 bucks a pair.

203
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,157
And they only increase in value.

204
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:51,295
I guess that's your new
best friend now, Santiago.

205
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:53,892
Emphasis on "iago," backstabber.

206
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,466
I'm surprised you've read othello.

207
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:57,035
What the hell's othello?

208
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,403
I'm calling you the parrot from Aladdin.

209
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:00,304
I wouldn't be working for the vulture.

210
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,207
I'd be working with him in data analysis.

211
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:06,144
Oh, it's just a lousy desk job?

212
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:08,713
Okay, never mind.
You're not gonna do that.

213
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:10,314
You love working cases too much.

214
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,483
Here's the plan:
We're gonna catch this perp.

215
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:13,985
You're gonna remember how much
you love your job.

216
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,153
You're gonna skip that interview.

217
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:16,788
And that's a Peralta guarantee.

218
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:18,189
Your last Peralta guarantee was that

219
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,891
you could dunk a basketball.

220
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:21,592
I never said I couldn't use a ladder.

221
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:23,861
Peralta guarantee achieved.

222
00:08:24,863 --> 00:08:26,431
Aah!

223
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:28,066
The subtext of the guarantee was that

224
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,095
you would be entertained, and you were.

225
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,702
Let's go!

226
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,779
Okay, so I've already taken care

227
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,247
of a few obvious problems.

228
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:37,648
I moved the toaster to the break room,

229
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,283
far away from Boyle.

230
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,284
Good.
What's this red area here,

231
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,253
the Diaz triangle?

232
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,756
Right, so you know
about Rosa's anger incidents.

233
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,492
It's my birthday.
I hate birthdays.

234
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,327
If you wish me a Happy Birthday,

235
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,762
I will punch you.

236
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,096
You're a funny little bird, Diaz.

237
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,998
Happy Birthday.

238
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:56,000
Any time mt. Diaz erupts,

239
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:57,735
everyone on the squad avoids her.

240
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,637
Mt. Diaz.
Humorous, yes.

241
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,606
Tell me, what room is just

242
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,441
down the hall from her desk?

243
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,843
The bathroom.

244
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,379
If people are afraid to walk by Diaz,

245
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,150
bathroom breaks would be to a minimum.

246
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,552
Hey, Diaz, I just need

247
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:18,389
to make sure I've got
the details right in this file.

248
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,224
Yeah, guy was passing bad checks.

249
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,026
But is this the same guy?

250
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:25,129
Yeah, the name here
is the same name on the checks.

251
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,664
Ca-caw!

252
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,566
Okay, all right, thank you,
thank you. Ca-caw!

253
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,902
Got it.

254
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,871
Come on!

255
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,441
I'm so sick of these sucky computers.

256
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,010
Aah!

257
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,982
One more step and you're next.

258
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,353
NYPD.

259
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,257
Oh, boy.

260
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,525
NYPD, sir.

261
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:56,394
Have you seen anything unusual today?

262
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,197
Oh, no.

263
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,198
This was nice, thank you.

264
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,099
Wait, wait, wait.

265
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,634
What is this music?

266
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,838
Oh, this is from my country:
Leirkrakeegovnia.

267
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,040
Do you like it?
I weirdly do.

268
00:10:09,074 --> 00:10:11,609

272
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:22,520
you meet people from all over the world.

273
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,121
This song is a celebration song

274
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:26,290
from when a dog loses its virginity.

275
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,159
Who checks that?

276
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:30,628
I was having a smoke, and I saw a bellboy

277
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,730
take his jacket off
and throw it in the dumpster,

278
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:34,398
then go back inside.

279
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,700
Well, that's unusual.

280
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,034
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you.

281
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:39,237
Looks like we are going dumpster diving.

282
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,638
Great.

283
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,541

00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:47,778
I can't believe you would ever

286
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,113
consider leaving this job.

287
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:51,315
This is real police work, and you love it.

288
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,884
Remember that time you had
to shove your hand

289
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,685
down that woman's throat
to get her car keys?

290
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,922
Why do you even care if I leave?

291
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,924
Because the vulture is the worst.

292
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,559
That whole division is the worst.

293
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,061
They steal cases.
It's the lowest of the low.

294
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,129
So if I transferred somewhere else,

295
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,130
you wouldn't care at all?

296
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,432
No, of course not.

297
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,769
Do whatever you want,
you know, it's your life.

298
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,439
Aha!
The jacket.

299
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:16,774
This case is heating up.

300
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,409
Ooh, receipt in the pocket.

301
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,278
Dust it for prints.
And send a scan to Boyle.

302
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,147
Yes. You're feeling it now.
Whoo!

303
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,616
The thief's name is Benjamin Disanto.

304
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,784
Here's an old mug shot.

305
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:28,419
He's surprisingly photogenic.

306
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,820
A lot of criminals are, strangely.

307
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,255
He doesn't work here.

308
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,090
Must have stolen the bellhop uniform.

309
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,425
Receptionist just spotted Disanto

310
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:35,693
entering the Salieri ballroom.

311
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,961
What's going on in there?

312
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,496
An auction of Greek antiquities.

313
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,098
I believe it's
pronounced "antiques."

314
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:43,601
I'm sorry about my partner.
He's never been to a museum.

315
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,803
Have so.
Wax museums don't count.

316
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,204
Then why are they called museums?

317
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:48,205
It's right there in the name.

318
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,507
Oh, my God.
Come on.

319
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,776
It's going really well, sir.

320
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,345
We've gone from 10 cases
per hour to almost 20.

321
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,213
It's good, but we can do better.

322
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,550
Tell me about
the Boyle-linetti reaction.

323
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,851
Boyle gets cold a lot

324
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,520
because of what he calls his...

325
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,500
Medically diagnosed thin skin.

326
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,490
So he goes to the lost and found,

327
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:09,794
and he grabs something
that's usually unflattering.

328
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,496
That's when Gina gets involved.

329
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:15,633
Sweet sweater, Charles.

330
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,501
You look like you're starring
in an Albanian remake

331
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,003
of the cosby show.

332
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:22,073
Dr. Huxtable, Dr. Huxtable.

333
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,475
Gina is completely useless

334
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:26,644
when Boyle is wearing
lost-and-found clothes.

335
00:12:26,678 --> 00:12:28,646
Well, I really can't blame her
on this one.

336
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,315
Maybe we should just,
empty lost and found.

337
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,650
Already done, sir.

338
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,387
Good lord.
Where did he get that?

339
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:39,357
Oh, my God, we're doomed.
Boyle looks like a lesbian.

340
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,591
He must have gotten it

341
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,326
from the evidence locker or something.

342
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:43,326
Don't worry.

343
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:45,329
I had a backup plan.

344
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,832
I distracted her with a mirror.

345
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,167
She's like a cockatiel, sir...

346
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,703
Fascinated by her own reflection.

347
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,706
Hello, sexy,
how are you?

348
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:57,174
Right back at ya.

349
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,609
Well done.

350
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,681
Good afternoon, sir,
I'm Detective Peralta.

351
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,216
This is Detective
always-stays-loyal.

352
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,184
She's named after her father
Alvin stays-loyal.

353
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:08,519
We're tracking a thief that's stolen

354
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,087
thousands of dollars worth of jewelry.

355
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,722
We think he's scouting auction winners,

356
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,124
so he can rob their rooms.

357
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,760
We called for backup,
but we need to move now.

358
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:16,921
And we have to keep it quiet.

359
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,295
What can I do to help?

360
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,664
Well, there's too many people in here.

361
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,065
I need a better vantage point.

362
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,900
Any way I can get up onstage
by the podium?

363
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:24,435
You'll blow our cover if you go up there.

364
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,903
You don't exactly blend in.

365
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,706
Yeah.

366
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,708
Irwin, how would you
like to have the honor

367
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:31,976
of being the first man to undress

368
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,179
in front of Amy Santiago?
Okay.

369
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:40,257
Here we go.

370
00:13:40,258 --> 00:13:41,425
Hello, everyone.

371
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:43,360
My name is Roger Strikewell,

372
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,796
and I will be your guest
auctioneer this evening.

373
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:48,365
So many faces to look at.

374
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:49,866
I won a radio contest,

375
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:51,435
and I'm so excited to be here tonight

376
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:54,338
to sell you all of
these cool, old, Greek things.

377
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:58,475
Our first item up for bid
is lot number 344.

378
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:02,279
It is this old "vase,"
"vahs" if you're nasty.

379
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:06,283
It was made
in the year... five

380
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:10,654
and depicts the classic Greek fable:

381
00:14:10,655 --> 00:14:13,390
Boy meets girl, boy has goat legs.

382
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:16,126
And on the back,
just a whole bunch of wheat.

383
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:19,062
So let's start the bidding at $10.

384
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:22,265
Okay, started it way too low.

385
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,402
We've done it, sir.

386
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:26,503
If we stay on this pace,

387
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:28,205
I think we'll finish on time.

388
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,406
I think we should keep going,

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,109
make the office even more efficient.

390
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:34,945
Sir, are you familiar
with the story of icarus?

391
00:14:34,946 --> 00:14:36,513
He didn't know when to quit.

392
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:38,615
He flew too close to the sun,

393
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:41,318
and his wax wings melted, and he died.

394
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,654
Are you familiar
with the story of Moneyball?

395
00:14:43,655 --> 00:14:45,756
A man uses statistics and logic

396
00:14:45,757 --> 00:14:47,157
to win several baseball games.

397
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,558
It's my favorite film.

398
00:14:48,593 --> 00:14:50,627
The statistical analysis...

399
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:54,002
It's so beautiful.

400
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,766
This office is becoming a powerhouse

401
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,300
of paperwork processing.

402
00:14:57,301 --> 00:14:59,136
I'm flying high, sergeant,

403
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:02,172
and I'm never coming down.

404
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:05,976
I have 85.
Do I have 90?

405
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,013
I have 90 from the man
with the face at table four.

406
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:12,683
This is terrible... you don't know
what you're doing.

407
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:14,451
Adam Sandier?
Yeah, that's right.

408
00:15:14,452 --> 00:15:17,621
I collect antiquities.
I'm a serious person.

409
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:20,190
I'm writing a movie right now
about the Russian revolution.

410
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:22,292
Oh, really?
Who does Kevin James play in it?

411
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:24,861
Ha, ha.
It's a serious movie.

412
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:26,930
Trotsky.
There it is.

413
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:29,132
But he's got a wife who never wears a bra.

414
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,034
I think you're gonna like it.

415
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,396
Thanks for dressing up, by the way.

416
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:33,904
All right, back to this plate.

417
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:36,173
I think you could use it
for a variety of things.

418
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:37,574
New item up there.
How much you guys

419
00:15:37,575 --> 00:15:38,975
wanna pay for me to stick my socks

420
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:40,744
in this moron's mouth?
I will.

421
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,345
Did football legend Joe Theismann

422
00:15:42,346 --> 00:15:44,347
just bid $1,000 to put a sock in my mouth?

423
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,516
You bet. Okay, but let's get
it going a little higher.

424
00:15:46,517 --> 00:15:48,385
Seriously, back to the porno plate...

425
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,987
1,200 bucks, sock in the mouth?

426
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:53,056
Boom, okay, the idiot
gets the sock in the mouth.

427
00:15:53,057 --> 00:15:55,092
I'd say 1,300 would be even better.

428
00:15:55,093 --> 00:15:56,359
1,300!

429
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,328
Joe Theismann coming in strong.

430
00:15:58,329 --> 00:15:59,663
I got 1,300.
25,000 from...

431
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:00,831
and a one and a two and a...

432
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:03,900
Boom, sold to Joey Theismann!

433
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:05,902
Congratulations, you're getting
a sock in your mouth,

434
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:07,471
1,300 bucks, Joe Theismann.

435
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:08,872
Can I stick the sock in his mouth?

436
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,073
I'll pay extra.

437
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:11,374
Yes, you may, because I just

438
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,543
sold my item to the man

439
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:15,112
in the gray shirt at table 18.

440
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:17,180
NYPD. You're under arrest.

441
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:18,248
Heading your way.

442
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,457
Gotcha!

443
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,960
My leg! My leg!

444
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,029
You broke my other leg.

445
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,866
Oh, this was supposed to be a safe event.

446
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:36,867
Nothing to see here.

447
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:38,635
Except for the bone,

448
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:40,504
sticking out of the leg.

449
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,773
Joe, I video'd it!

450
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,407
What a day?

451
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:46,576
Met Adam Sandier,
broke Joe Theismann's leg,

452
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,245
and solved an awesome case together.

453
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:49,546
Yeah, good day.

454
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:50,714
Hell yeah, it is.

455
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:52,048
Drinks are on me.

456
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,784
Jake, I'm still doing the interview.

457
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:55,385
What?

458
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:57,120
No.

459
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:58,555
Don't do that.

460
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:00,223
We still have to process the perp.

461
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:01,792
You love processing...
It's your favorite thing,

462
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:03,093
after organizing your emails

463
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:04,795
and replacing toilet paper rolls.

464
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:07,397
This job would be
a great opportunity for me.

465
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:09,666
Okay, whatever.
You know what?

466
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,334
You're being a bad partner.

467
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:13,270
You're joining forces with the enemy.

468
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:15,505
And from now on, I'm gonna
call you "the cheetah."

469
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:17,407
They're scavengers, just like vultures.

470
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:18,575
And I kinda wish I hadn't said it,

471
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:19,910
'cause they're pretty cool.

472
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:22,512
Come on, jewel thief.

473
00:17:22,513 --> 00:17:24,848
You're my only friend now.

474
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:30,329
Scully, what are you doing at my desk?

475
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,497
And working?

476
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:32,927
What is going on today?

477
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:34,533
The Captain put me here.

478
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:36,535
Says I waste time
when I sit next to Hitchcock.

479
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:42,975
Okay, well, go work in the break room.

480
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,210
Hello, Peralta.

481
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:45,711
A human greeting, nicely done.

482
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:47,046
Updates on the case?

483
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,381
Well, you're gonna love this one.

484
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:49,749
We busted the guy for grand larceny.

485
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,117
And to celebrate, Santiago is taking

486
00:17:51,118 --> 00:17:52,885
a job interview at major crimes.

487
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:53,990
Can you believe that?

488
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:55,955
Yes, she told me yesterday.
What?

489
00:17:55,956 --> 00:17:57,923
Why didn't you try and talk her out of it?

490
00:17:57,924 --> 00:17:59,191
She would literally shave her head

491
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:00,459
if you asked her to.

492
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,061
Which, by the way, is a great idea

493
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:03,362
for a prank, if you're
looking to prank her.

494
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:05,298
Santiago wants to make Captain one day.

495
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,899
I know, because I've frequently caught her

496
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,968
wearing my hat and looking into a mirror.

497
00:18:08,969 --> 00:18:11,904
Dismissed.

498
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:16,042
I support her decision.

499
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:17,476
That's what good detectives do.

500
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:21,350
They have each other's back,
no matter what.

501
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:27,653
All right, let's move on

502
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:30,389
to your unpaid parking tickets.

503
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:32,491
Dude. Dude, fire.

504
00:18:32,492 --> 00:18:34,226
Oh, my. Fire.

505
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:36,629
Hey! Fire!

506
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,431
Oh, I-I got it, okay.

507
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,465
Here we go.
Here we go, Boyle.

508
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:42,635
I got it.

509
00:18:42,636 --> 00:18:44,103
What happened, Scully?

510
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:45,438
I didn't know there was a toaster there.

511
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,739
Why is the toaster there?

512
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:47,973
oh.
Aah!

513
00:18:47,974 --> 00:18:49,008
My fringe!

514
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:50,176
My beautiful fringe!

515
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:51,610
Boyle's on fire!

516
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:55,147
Icarus.

517
00:18:55,148 --> 00:18:57,283
Extinguisher's empty, morons.

518
00:18:57,284 --> 00:19:00,419
Aah!

519
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:05,758
Back to the drawing board.

520
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,327
Sir, I'm begging you,
please, we have to stop.

521
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:10,162
Boyle is still smoldering.

522
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:12,465
The problem is, we didn't
take Peralta into account.

523
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:13,966
In our next trial...

524
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:20,639
Hello, boys.
Welcome to your own office.

525
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:23,709
I hear you're trying to make
the precinct more efficient.

526
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,378
Gina, what are you doing
in the Captain's chair?

527
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:27,913
Please, I'm open to any ideas
about efficiency.

528
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:31,117
I've narrowed the problem
down to one location:

529
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:33,652
The Holt-Jeffords vortex.

530
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:35,688
Things would go a lot faster
if the two of you

531
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:38,324
did less experimenting and more working.

532
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:41,293
And I'm not the only one who thinks that.

533
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:45,197
You melted my fringe.

534
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:46,565
You think I have an anger problem?

535
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,001
I don't.
You are both dead to me.

536
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:51,337
Well, I suppose it's possible

537
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:52,905
we may have been a tad enthusiastic

538
00:19:52,906 --> 00:19:54,540
in our pursuit of efficiency...

539
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:57,042
Really?
A tad, icarus?

540
00:19:57,043 --> 00:20:00,079
Fine, message received.

541
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,214
Jeffords and I will get right to work.

542
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:04,984
Great, that will be all.
Thank you.

543
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:06,585
Get the hell out of my chair.

544
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,387
All right, I pushed it
a little bit on that one.

545
00:20:08,422 --> 00:20:10,923
Okay, bye.

546
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:14,560
Santiago.

547
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:16,896
Before you go in there,
there's something I have to say.

548
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:18,497
I'm sorry I said you were a bad partner.

549
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,132
I was the bad partner.

550
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,535
The truth is, our job isn't always great.

551
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:23,903
I mean, sometimes it sucks.

552
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:26,005
But it sucks a little less

553
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:27,406
when I get to do it with you.

554
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,942
So when you said you were gonna leave,

555
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:31,210
I freaked out, and that was dumb.

556
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:33,746
I should've been more supportive.

557
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,047
You're a great Detective,

558
00:20:35,048 --> 00:20:36,916
and they'd be lucky to have you.

559
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,218
In fact, if it helps,

560
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,587
I wrote you a letter of recommendation,

561
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,322
which is riddled with
spelling errors, I might add.

562
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:45,591
Including the word, "recommendation,"

563
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:48,093
which is just... I don't have
to tell you about that.

564
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,929
There's no way there's four "M" s
in that word, right?

565
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:51,597
I already turned down the job.

566
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:53,332
Seriously?

567
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:55,935
In the end, you were right.
I don't wanna sit at a desk.

568
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:59,038
And right now, I like where I am.

569
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,541
But thanks
for thinking I'm great.

570
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:04,610
No, I take back all
of the things I just said.

571
00:21:04,644 --> 00:21:06,979
You said
I was a good Detective,

572
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,014
and you were nice.

573
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:10,616
This is my nightmare.

574
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,218
Lookee, lookee.

575
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:14,386
I thought I saw your big,
white ass lumbering around.

576
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,489
As for you, Santiago,
well, now you certainly

577
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,123
showed your true colors, didn't you?

578
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:20,359
And they're a shade of pink
called "loser."

579
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:21,961
All right, everybody just calm down.

580
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,762
There's no reason we can't be friends.

581
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:26,332
Here, I brought you a peace offering.

582
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,100
Run!

583
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:31,003
Oh.

584
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:35,852
