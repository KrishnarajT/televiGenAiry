1
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:04,372
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa!

2
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:05,607
Settle.

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:07,075
Sorry, sarge.

4
00:00:07,077 --> 00:00:10,378
Ugh, Halloween is the worst.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,380
Everyone's drunk,
wearing a mask,

6
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:13,882
and carrying a fake gun.

7
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:16,017
Plus all the girls think
they have to dress sexy.

8
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,020
I know, that is the worst.
Please make them stop.

9
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:20,488
I passed a slutty tree
on the way here.

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,490
Who wants to have sex
with a tree?

11
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:23,525
Was it a maple?

12
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,993
Was it a maple?

13
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:27,028
Buon giorno,
buon giorno.

14
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,496
Pretty cool 'stume, huh?

15
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:29,698
'Stume?

16
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,499
Short for costume.
Ah.

17
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,568
All right, let me guess.
You are dumpy Chuck Norris.

18
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,869
No, I'm—
dumpy Ron Weasley.

19
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:36,371
No.

20
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:37,639
You guys, stop it.

21
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,574
He put thought
into his costume,

22
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:42,110
and he is obviously Miranda
from Sex and the City.

23
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:43,511
Guys, I'm Mario Batali!

24
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:45,847
"Molto Mario"?
Celebrity chef?

25
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:47,615
Ginger Prince
of Little Italy?

26
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:49,517
Is he also
a homeless troll doll?

27
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:50,618
'Cause you look like
a homeless troll doll.

28
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,821
Hey, sweet Batali costume,
dude.

29
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:54,556
Thank you!

30
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:55,990
There's a man
with impeccable taste.

31
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:59,561
He bit a guy's butt off
at a WNBA game.

32
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:00,628
Eric Stoltz from Mask.

33
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,630
I'll take it.
Yeah.

34
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:04,532
I hope you're all
well rested.

35
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:06,501
It's gonna be
a busy night.

36
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:07,535
The holding cell's
completely full.

37
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:09,037
I keep having to separate

38
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,505
Hillary Clinton
and Kim Jong-un.

39
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:12,907
Stop it!
Stop making out!

40
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,677
Hey—no!
What would Bill say?

41
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,145
We need two undercovers

42
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:18,646
at the DeKalb street
warehouse party.

43
00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:21,583
Boyle, you're already
in costume as, uh,

44
00:01:21,585 --> 00:01:22,650
Joy Behar?

45
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:23,852
I'm Mario Batali.

46
00:01:23,854 --> 00:01:25,920
Okay.
And, uh, Santiago,

47
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:27,155
you go with him.

48
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:29,524
Yes, sir.
Damn it.

49
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:31,993
Santiago, I know
that you hate Halloween,

50
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,695
but stick with me,
and I promise you,

51
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:35,163
you will love it.

52
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:36,598
Can you magically make everyone
kind, sober,

53
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,699
and fully dressed?

54
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,534
"Kind, sober,
and fully dressed."

55
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:40,702
Good news, everyone,
we found the name

56
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:42,904
of Santiago's sex tape.

57
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:06,761
Well, ring it up, nerds.

58
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:08,763
I just arrested
my first Halloween idiot

59
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:10,031
of the season.

60
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,599
He was trying to rob a bank

61
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,668
but had a little trouble
with the getaway.

62
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,970
Trying to "split," huh?

63
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:18,807
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll
get out on "a peel."

64
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:20,141
I'm so glad you're stuck.

65
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:21,643
I've got a million of these.

66
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:23,578
No, no, don't touch the money!
Ugh!

67
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,480
I swear,
these perps are so stupid.

68
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,781
I'd make a better criminal
than any of them.

69
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:28,550
Yeah, you would.
You'd be an evil mastermind,

70
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:30,585
and everyone would call you
the handsome bandit.

71
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,554
Thank you, Charles.
And the best part is,

72
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:34,589
none of you could catch me.

73
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,025
I'm fairly certain
you would be caught.

74
00:02:37,027 --> 00:02:38,493
No, scratch that.

75
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:40,628
I'm 100% sure
you'd be caught.

76
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,230
Ho, ho, ho!

77
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:43,731
All right,
challenge accepted.

78
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,467
I didn't issue a challenge.
Fine.

79
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:46,868
I'll issue it for you.

80
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,503
What's the most valuable thing
in your office?

81
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:49,704
My medal of valor.

82
00:02:49,706 --> 00:02:51,139
God, you are such a hero.

83
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:53,107
All right, how about this?
I will bet you

84
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,776
that by midnight tonight,

85
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:56,611
I can steal the medal of valor
from your office.

86
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,980
Why would I possibly
agree to that?

87
00:02:58,982 --> 00:03:00,515
Because if I lose,
I'll work

88
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:01,649
the next five weekends,
no overtime.

89
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:03,051
And I won't tell
anyone here

90
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:04,586
about the time I saw you
wearing short shorts

91
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:05,653
outside of work.

92
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:06,955
But if I win...
You won't.

93
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:08,490
You have to do all
of my paperwork tonight,

94
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,793
the busiest and spookiest night
of the year.

95
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:14,529
And you have
to publicly state

96
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,533
that I'm an amazing
detective/genius.

97
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:20,668
And this won't interfere
with you doing your job?

98
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,172
You mean my job as an amazing
detective/genius?

99
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:25,673
No, it will not.
I'll do all of my work,

100
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:26,708
guaranteed.

101
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,510
I'm considering it.

102
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:29,611
I'm interested.

103
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,146
I agree to participate.
All right.

104
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:34,716
There's the robot
I fell in love with.

105
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:36,017
Hey.

106
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,819
Sister Steve here
got mugged.

107
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:39,220
Some guy dressed
as the royal baby

108
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:41,289
punched him
and took his wallet.

109
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,724
She keeps laughing at me.

110
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:44,158
Can't tell you how many nuns

111
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,660
I wanted to beat up
in catholic school.

112
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:46,861
Ten.

113
00:03:46,863 --> 00:03:48,830
I didn't know you went
to catholic school.

114
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:50,665
Good.
You shouldn't know it.

115
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,167
I get it.
You're so mysterious and tough.

116
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,669
But you know what I think?

117
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:56,571
You're actually
a big softy.

118
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:57,872
No, I think
she's really mean.

119
00:03:57,874 --> 00:03:59,541
You probably read
a Maya Angelou poem

120
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:01,209
at your graduation
and cried.

121
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,944
Didn't graduate.
Had to leave.

122
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:04,279
Why?
What'd you do?

123
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,047
Here's a hint.

124
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:08,616
I'm not gonna tell you.

125
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:11,319
Oh, I'm gonna find out
anyway.

126
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,754
I'm a detective.

127
00:04:12,756 --> 00:04:15,223
I will detect!

128
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,624
Hey.

129
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:18,560
Got an arrest file here
for the Captain.

130
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:19,794
Drunk and disorderly.

131
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:21,596
So, anyways...

132
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,064
Gina!

133
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,566
We never talk anymore.

134
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,200
How's the dance troupe?
Did you get a haircut?

135
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,602
What's the Captain's
schedule like today?

136
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,337
I'm not gonna help you
rob him, Jake.

137
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,606
I'm his assistant,
and I take that job

138
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,274
incredibly seriously.

139
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:34,342
You're literally making
paper airplanes

140
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,277
out of police reports
right now.

141
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,946
Well, how am I supposed to get
it into that garbage can?

142
00:04:37,948 --> 00:04:39,247
Please, Gina?

143
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:40,782
Fine, Captain's got
a meeting

144
00:04:40,784 --> 00:04:42,750
downstairs in ten minutes.

145
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,353
You're the best.
Mwah!

146
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,955
What does your skin taste like?

147
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:49,090
Dina Lohan.
I'm wearing her face lotion.

148
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,925
That's it.

149
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:52,727
Thank you.

150
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,696
Okay, party's
around the corner.

151
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,098
Tipster said there'll be
a huge amount of drug activity.

152
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,667
Why is this costume
so stiff?

153
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,636
And what is that smell?

154
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:03,304
The department never washes
them, so it's probably vomit.

155
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,339
Hey!

156
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,641
I got you a chocolate.

157
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:09,377
Yet another great thing
about Halloween—chocolate!

158
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:11,346
Thanks.
Oh, look.

159
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,681
Raggedy Ann is drinking vodka
right from the bottle.

160
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,183
People think
if they put on a costume,

161
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:17,685
they can just get away
with anything they want.

162
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:20,755
Halloween is Christmas
for jerks.

163
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,857
Come on, ma'am.
No open containers.

164
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:26,661
Oh, and why should I listen
to you, bone person?

165
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:29,364
It's called a skeleton.
It's a very common word.

166
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:30,832
Just put the vodka away.

167
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,100
You guys are cops?

168
00:05:32,102 --> 00:05:33,401
These guys are cops!

169
00:05:42,945 --> 00:05:44,712
Are you in my ceiling,
Peralta?

170
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:46,648
No.

171
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,882
So what's the plan?

172
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,183
You wait for me
to leave my office,

173
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:50,351
lower yourself down,
take my medal,

174
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:51,819
and win the bet?

175
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:53,054
Who are you talking to?

176
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:54,822
There's no one up here.

177
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:56,424
Peralta,
just so you know,

178
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:59,093
right now, I am taking
my medal off the wall

179
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:01,095
and placing it
in a locked safe

180
00:06:01,097 --> 00:06:03,031
whose combination is known
only to me.

181
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,999
The safe, in turn,

182
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,401
is locked in the cabinet.

183
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:11,005
The only key to that cabinet
is on my person.

184
00:06:11,007 --> 00:06:13,374
I'm off to my meeting.
Good luck with your plan.

185
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:15,910
You think that scares me?

186
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:18,946
I laugh in the face
of adversity!

187
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:20,415
Are you still there?

188
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:22,050
Captain, are you still there?
I can't hear—

189
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:24,352
Agh!

190
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:25,687
Ow.

191
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:30,124
Here you go.

192
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:32,794
Don't touch the butter.

193
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:34,328
What happened?
I thought you guys

194
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,396
were supposed to be
at the warehouse party.

195
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:36,931
We got egged.

196
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,433
Some of the shell
got in my contacts

197
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,235
and my hair and my mouth
and my bra.

198
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:42,270
I can't tell
if that's hot or not.

199
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:43,738
Not hot.

200
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,972
Eggshell in my bra
is not hot.

201
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:46,240
Well, it's kinda hot.

202
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:49,210
Boobs go in a bra.
Up top.

203
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:51,379
Whoo! My man.

204
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:53,715
Well, it sounds like
costume duty is going great.

205
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,149
So great.
We're having the best time.

206
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:56,384
Right, Amy?

207
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:58,186
I wish I was dead.
Hmm.

208
00:06:58,188 --> 00:06:59,854
How's the unwinnable bet going?

209
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:01,155
Well, on the one hand,
I fell through the ceiling

210
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,990
and onto a pencil,
but on the other hand,

211
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,726
I also badly bruised
my brain.

212
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:06,060
If you wanted to make
a bet with Holt,

213
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:07,395
you shoulda made a bet
you could win.

214
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:09,063
Like who wears
more denim jackets.

215
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:10,498
That was one time.

216
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,333
You guys never forget
anything.

217
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:13,468
You know, frankly,
I'm a little surprised

218
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,136
you don't think
I can win this thing.

219
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,804
You're always telling me
how I'm the best.

220
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,873
You're the best, Jake.

221
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:20,408
Paperwork delivery.

222
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,943
You're the best, Jake.

223
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:23,878
Jake, you're the best.

224
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Thank you, Charles.

225
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:27,215
Yeah, maybe it's just Charles.

226
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:29,050
Look, Jake,

227
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:31,052
I love you like you're one
of my daughters. Really?

228
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:33,287
But it's not about you
or how smart you are.

229
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:34,355
It's about Captain Holt.

230
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:36,124
The man's a genius.

231
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,425
He's had your number
at every turn.

232
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:41,796
Well, not this day...
Turn... Time.

233
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:44,999
Sorry, I'm pretty sure
I had a concussion back there.

234
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,300
Here I come.
All right.

235
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:49,537
Ohh, strong.
Ahh.

236
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,472
Okay, here's the first set

237
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,407
of royal babies
I rounded up.

238
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,442
Popular costume.

239
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:55,910
Any of these guys
look familiar?

240
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:57,278
Maybe the third guy.

241
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,046
The baby who mugged me
was pretty short.

242
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,382
You're not supposed
to laugh at me.

243
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:03,084
Number three,

244
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:04,485
step forward and say,
"Give me your money,

245
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,053
you stupid bag of crap."

246
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,890
Gimme your money,
you stupid bag of crap.

247
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,291
No, wrong giant baby.

248
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:11,359
I still want to know
why you got kicked out

249
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:13,127
of catholic school.

250
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,495
Were you doing drugs?

251
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:17,331
Worse.
Selling drugs?

252
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,868
Worse.
How bad could it have been?

253
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,371
Did you burn down a church?

254
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:26,240
Number three, step forward
and say the word

255
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:27,542
"Worse."

256
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:30,244
Worse.

257
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:32,246
Excuse me, Gina.

258
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:33,381
I can't find Peralta anywhere,
and you're the only one

259
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:35,283
who can decipher
his handwriting.

260
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:37,919
He arrested that bunny,
but I don't know what for.

261
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:40,922
He's either a crispy
mother werewolf

262
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,591
or cowboy mustard,
Oslo, Norway.

263
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,226
Hmm.

264
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:48,229
The bunny groped multiple women
on the subway.

265
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:50,965
Being able to read
Jake's writing is a gift.

266
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:53,134
A useless, useless gift.

267
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:57,138
Excuse me one second.

268
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,273
Nice costume, Peralta.

269
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,108
No Peralta here.

270
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,478
Just a normal janitor
pushing trash around.

271
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,380
Come out of there.

272
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:09,884
Captain, hey.

273
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,152
You really thought
this was gonna work?

274
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:12,386
Uh, it did work.

275
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:13,454
This whole janitor gambit

276
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:15,256
was designed to fail.

277
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:16,524
It's just like in chess.

278
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,159
Sometimes in order to win,

279
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,460
you have to sacrifice
your king.

280
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:21,395
That's exactly how
you lose in chess.

281
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:22,530
Have you ever played
the game?

282
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,098
Yeah, I used to play
with my Uncle Bob

283
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,933
all the time,
and he said I was great.

284
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:28,169
This is a game
of concentration, Jake.

285
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,239
So focus your mind,
and start shooting.

286
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:37,378
Now you're a master
of chess, huh?

287
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,512
He taught me how to shoot
backgammon too.

288
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:40,114
I expected better
of you.

289
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:41,382
You could have at least
created a diversion

290
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:43,384
to distract me
from your terrible costume.

291
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,986
Uh, I'm not a dumb butt.

292
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,354
I had a diversion planned.

293
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:49,390
There was just
a slight timing issue.

294
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:50,892
Oh, my God!

295
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:53,027
Get down, everyone!
There's a big fire!

296
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,595
Captain, you better head
over there for, like,

297
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:57,131
15 minutes and see what's
going on with that.

298
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:00,201
Beware of the back draft.
I'll be in your office.

299
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:04,505
You have beautiful eyes.

300
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:05,940
Have it your way.

301
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,642
But you're gonna need this.

302
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:10,111
And... That.

303
00:10:10,113 --> 00:10:12,914
It's filthy in there.

304
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,354
Come on, Amy!
Loosen up!

305
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:21,489
You look like
such a cop!

306
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:24,191
Come on, have some fun,
you know?

307
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:26,260
It'll help you blend in!

308
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,528
Whoo!

309
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,331
Stop trying to get me
to love Halloween.

310
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,999
It'll never work.

311
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,234
I'm backing it up.

312
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:36,037
Oh, God, please don't.

313
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,205
Hey, heads up.

314
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,273
I'll cut 'em off at the exit.
Okay.

315
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:42,343
Move! Move, move!

316
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:43,978
He ditched the drugs.
I'm on it.

317
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,413
Ugh.

318
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:49,016
Oof, everything
is sticking to me.

319
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:50,351
Ooh.

320
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:52,320
Okay, ugh.
Yes.

321
00:10:52,322 --> 00:10:54,355
Hey, watch it, man.

322
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:56,357
Ugh! What is that?

323
00:10:56,359 --> 00:11:00,428
How is it hot and cold?

324
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,497
So the soonest you can fix
the ceiling is Monday?

325
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:12,740
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

326
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:14,375
Wait, stop scratching me.

327
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:15,409
We're supposed to be a team.

328
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:17,278
Ahem.

329
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,315
Captain, hi... I was just
photocopying some stuff.

330
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,050
Are you trying to jam pigeons
into my air-conditioning vent

331
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:24,318
to flush me
out of my office?

332
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,420
Way to ruin the surprise.

333
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:28,756
How did you get those birds?
By using my big, fat brain.

334
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,524
Get in the bag,
you damn bird.

335
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:31,759
Eat the bread.
Eat the bread!

336
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,361
I gotcha!
I gotcha!

337
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:36,430
All part of my elaborate plan
to defeat you.

338
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:38,599
So far, you and
your big, fat brain

339
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,501
are losing—badly.

340
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,737
Maybe, if we're talking
about who's winning our bet.

341
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:45,373
But if we're talking
about who's holding more birds,

342
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,375
I'm winning,
four-nothing.

343
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:50,411
You're only holding two.

344
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:53,714
Yeah.

345
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:57,785
Ooh, when you were
logging in the drugs,

346
00:11:57,787 --> 00:11:59,186
you missed
some awesome stuff.

347
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:01,288
Guy walked by in full
astronaut costume,

348
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,556
gave me a high five.

349
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:04,725
He high-fived me too.

350
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:06,027
Wait—Hitchcock?

351
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,528
Darn it.

352
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,796
I wasn't supposed to talk,
but I got so excited

353
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:10,031
about that astronaut.

354
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,699
What is happening?

355
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:12,800
Amy paid me 50 bucks
to trade places with her

356
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:14,268
for the rest of the night.

357
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,669
Really?
Yeah.

358
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,739
I'm gonna use that money
to buy two suits.

359
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:23,044
Well, I was gonna ask you
to tell the Captain

360
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,545
that I brought in royal babies
for Diaz,

361
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:26,414
but I'm sure he already knows,

362
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,681
since he's always one step
ahead of me.

363
00:12:27,683 --> 00:12:29,116
Aww.

364
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:30,584
Why so down, little clown?

365
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:32,053
I'm just sick
of losing to Holt.

366
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:33,087
I want that medal.

367
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:34,522
It's not real gold.

368
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:37,058
I tried selling it online.
Zero bids.

369
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,260
But here's some advice
I gave to the girls

370
00:12:39,262 --> 00:12:41,595
in my dance troupe at the "Dance
Till You Drop" tournament.

371
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:45,166
That advice was, dance.
Dance!

372
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:46,634
Dance.

373
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:49,470
Yeah, I'm not really sure
that applies here, Gina.

374
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:51,505
It does apply.
It means don't give up.

375
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:54,175
We would've won if
Natasha's water hadn't broken.

376
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:56,110
Oh, Natasha had her baby?
You know Natasha?

377
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:57,344
Yeah.
Yeah.

378
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:58,612
Her dog has lupus.

379
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:00,414
Yeah.
That's a trip.

380
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,416
Small world.
Yes.

381
00:13:02,418 --> 00:13:07,288
All right, I'm gonna go cry.

382
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,090
I kind of feel bad for him.

383
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,324
Don't.

384
00:13:10,326 --> 00:13:11,826
He brought this on himself.

385
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:16,330
You can hang up now.

386
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:18,299
You paid money to get
out of working with me?

387
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:20,367
Charles, I had to.
Tonight has been awful.

388
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:23,137
Halloween is the worst,
and I don't understand

389
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,538
why you like it.

390
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,173
No, all the things
that you think are bad

391
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:28,342
about Halloween
are what make it great.

392
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:29,810
The big kids egg you.

393
00:13:29,812 --> 00:13:32,680
Then you and your friends
run away together.

394
00:13:32,682 --> 00:13:34,648
Friendships are forged
in the crucible

395
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,817
of Halloween adversity.

396
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:40,121
That's all I wanted
for us.

397
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:44,859
You can keep the wig.
I don't need it anymore.

398
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:48,129
I don't really need it either.

399
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,263
Hey, Captain Holt,

400
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:52,900
can you come out here
for one sec?

401
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,909
You need something, Peralta?
Yes, I do.

402
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:05,179
Hit it, royal babies.

403
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:16,891
What—no!

404
00:14:16,893 --> 00:14:18,159
Give me my keys.

405
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,827
Will you stop catching me?

406
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:21,695
Do you have any idea how much
I spent on key chains?

407
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,230
$23.

408
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,598
Wow, that is
unbelievably close.

409
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,866
$22.76.

410
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:28,669
Keys.
Okay, look.

411
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:29,904
Tonight has been
a little humiliating.

412
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:31,605
Things are not going well,

413
00:14:31,607 --> 00:14:33,207
so I'm gonna just
throw this out there.

414
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,608
What do you say
we call off the bet

415
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,843
and pretend this whole thing
never happened?

416
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:37,545
Oh, I'm not letting you
off the hook.

417
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:39,213
What? No. Pfft.

418
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:41,916
I meant to give you an out,
so you could save face.

419
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:43,918
This is getting sad.

420
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,921
Yeah, for you.

421
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:48,822
So.

422
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,758
I called your school.

423
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,629
And I managed to get a hold
of one sister Bernadette.

424
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:57,865
I remember that old bag.
She was my favorite.

425
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:59,400
Well, guess what she said.

426
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:01,569
Apparently, you were
a model student

427
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:04,705
and transferred
of your own volition.

428
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:08,242
Fine.

429
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,677
The reason I left
catholic school

430
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,912
was because I got into
the American Ballet Academy.

431
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,948
I was a classical dancer.

432
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,449
And I was good.

433
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:16,684
I knew it!

434
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:18,485
I knew you were
a big softy.

435
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:21,422
You tell anyone,
I break your face.

436
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:27,861
No, you won't.
You're too sensitive.

437
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:31,599
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

438
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,867
Some officers
just arrested Peralta.

439
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,269
What?
They caught him scaling

440
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:36,971
the side of the building
with a blowtorch.

441
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:42,943
Captain.

442
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,812
Welcome to the endgame.

443
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:46,347
Would you care to shake
the hand

444
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:47,915
of the man
who defeated you?

445
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:50,985
Forgot I was wearing handcuffs.
Ohh, that hurt.

446
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:53,621
Whoo!

447
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:57,891
Climbing the side of
the building with a blowtorch.

448
00:15:57,893 --> 00:15:59,260
What were you thinking?

449
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,828
I was thinking I had
better core strength.

450
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,263
I got winded, like,
ten feet up.

451
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:03,831
I knew you wouldn't
win the bet,

452
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,266
but your performance tonight
has made me question

453
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:06,734
not only how good
a detective you are,

454
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:09,870
but, quite frankly,
how smart you are.

455
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:12,373
Well, that's not surprising.
You constantly underestimate me.

456
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,276
No, you've been
correctly estimated.

457
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,711
You have five minutes
until your deadline,

458
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:19,680
and here you are,
handcuffed to a table,

459
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:21,015
in a locked room.

460
00:16:21,017 --> 00:16:25,019
Which is precisely
where I planned on being.

461
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:26,754
Captain, let me tell you
a little story.

462
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,555
You remember when
I fell through your ceiling?

463
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:30,491
Yes, that was
six hours ago.

464
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:32,593
It was, I admit,
a disastrous failure.

465
00:16:32,595 --> 00:16:34,995
But it gave me the idea
for Herman,

466
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:36,497
the friendly janitor
you met.

467
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:39,466
With Herman, I commenced
the perfect crime.

468
00:16:39,468 --> 00:16:41,735
I caught you as Herman.

469
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:44,338
But you didn't catch Rosa.

470
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,442
Come out of there.

471
00:16:48,444 --> 00:16:49,677
It turns out that Rosa

472
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,745
is great at picking locks.

473
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:54,315
Does not surprise me.
No, me neither.

474
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:55,983
Of course, I had to find a way
to get her out of your office

475
00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:59,086
So I created a diversion.

476
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:02,423
Not mistimed—
perfectly timed

477
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:03,791
so she could escape unseen.

478
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:05,059
What about the pigeons?

479
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:10,397
Their only purpose was
to draw you into the copy room

480
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:14,601
while two members of my team
broke into your locked office.

481
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:15,602
So now I had a way
into your office

482
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:18,072
and an open cabinet.

483
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:20,074
All that was left was
for the royal babies

484
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:21,475
to steal your keys.

485
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,444
Yes, but you didn't need
the keys.

486
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:25,446
The cabinet
was already unlocked.

487
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:26,580
You needed a way
into the safe.

488
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:28,349
And I got it.

489
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,851
Your keys back,
you didn't even notice

490
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:32,853
the sergeant steal your phone.

491
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:35,356
That's right, even
the sergeant is on my side.

492
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:37,524
I then had Charles dust
your screen cover for prints.

493
00:17:37,526 --> 00:17:39,393
The greasiest smudges revealed

494
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:40,894
the four numbers
you use the most—

495
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:42,996
the four numbers
in your passcode.

496
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,665
Based on your advanced age,

497
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,967
I assumed that you use the same
passcode for everything—

498
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:49,370
your phone, your email,
and, of course,

499
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,404
your safe.

500
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:52,973
That would be
a fair assumption.

501
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,541
It was at that point
that I bumped into a girl

502
00:17:54,543 --> 00:17:57,611
dressed as a sexy robot,
and we got our flirt on—hard.

503
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:01,682
'Sup?

504
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:05,886
'Sup?
Jake Peralta.

505
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:07,554
And how was flirting
part of the plan?

506
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:09,690
Oh, it wasn't.
It just ruled.

507
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:11,458
And that brings us
to five minutes ago,

508
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,559
when Amy came to your office
and told you

509
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:13,994
that I had been arrested.

510
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,162
I knew she's the only one
you would believe

511
00:18:15,164 --> 00:18:16,997
because, frankly,
she's usually too lame

512
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:18,832
to take part
in these kinds of things.

513
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:20,768
And as you walked over here,

514
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,136
Charles awkwardly stuffed
himself through your window

515
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:24,838
and opened your safe.

516
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,807
We had the four numbers
of your code, which meant

517
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:29,009
there were 24 possible
combinations for Charles to try.

518
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:30,677
That could take
up to four minutes,

519
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,513
which is why I really dragged
out this explanation.

520
00:18:32,515 --> 00:18:34,815
I mean, really stretched it.
I don't know if you noticed,

521
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:36,417
but there were times
where I was like,

522
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,118
what am I even talking about?
This isn't—

523
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,887
Oh.

524
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:42,656
But now,
four minutes is up.

525
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:44,792
Which means Boyle is either
on the other side of that door

526
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:46,059
holding your medal,

527
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:49,163
or I've lost.

528
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:50,597
Well, Captain,

529
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,065
it seems that Jake

530
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:56,136
isn't the only person
you underestima—

531
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:59,740
20 seconds to spare.
Game over, Captain.

532
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:00,974
Check me.

533
00:19:00,976 --> 00:19:02,476
I think you mean "checkmate."

534
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:03,977
You really need to learn
how to play chess.

535
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:06,447
How did you get everyone
to help you?

536
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,215
I appealed to their sense
of teamwork and camraderie

537
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:10,751
with a rousing speech that would
put Shakespeare to shame.

538
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:11,985
For too long,

539
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:14,822
we've been put down,
ridiculed,

540
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:16,757
made to wear ties!

541
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,991
But no more!

542
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:19,460
For today,

543
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,094
we defeat him!

544
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,897
And that worked? No. No, no.
Not at all.

545
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:25,999
My speech did not inspire them.

546
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,068
Come on.
So I bribed them.

547
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,903
I told them that if we
pulled this off,

548
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:31,472
I would do
all of their paperwork.

549
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,740
And since you're doing
all my paperwork...

550
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,576
I'm impressed, Peralta.

551
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:36,910
Well done.

552
00:19:36,912 --> 00:19:38,245
Thank you, sir.

553
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:41,748
In fact, the thing
that you failed to see, Captain,

554
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,784
teamwork, is exactly...
Captain?

555
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:45,786
What provided our success.
Sir?

556
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:48,755
He's not coming back.

557
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:51,825
Boyle, I need you
in the briefing room.

558
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:58,932
What is all this?

559
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,567
You know how I think
Halloween is for jerks?

560
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:03,237
Well, this Halloween,
I was the jerk.

561
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,972
I'm sorry about tonight.

562
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:06,106
"I'm sorry about tonight."

563
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:07,774
We found the title

564
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:09,843
for Santiago's
follow-up sex tape.

565
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:12,279
I'm sorry I couldn't convince
you to love Halloween.

566
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:13,847
It's not your fault.
I was terrible.

567
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,115
"It's not your fault
I was terrible"

568
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:16,650
is also one
of your sex tapes.

569
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:17,951
Ow.

570
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:20,287
Halloween is unbearable.

571
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:23,290
But it was slightly less
unbearable with you.

572
00:20:23,292 --> 00:20:24,625
Don't.
Okay.

573
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:26,260
Anyway.

574
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:28,795
We're all going to the bar,
so get changed,

575
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:30,564
'cause you can't be
the only one there

576
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:32,299
not wearing a 'stume.

577
00:20:32,301 --> 00:20:34,835
'Stume! Oh, my God.
It caught on.

578
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:38,305
No.

579
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:41,174
Ah, Captain Holt.
It is so nice to see you.

580
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:42,876
Never thought I'd say that.
Hmm.

581
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:45,012
A poor winner.
I never would've guessed.

582
00:20:45,014 --> 00:20:46,547
Yeah, you would've.

583
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,015
Way to go all out
on your costume, by the way.

584
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:50,150
I believe you have
an announcement to make,

585
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:52,286
so the floor is yours.

586
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:55,289
Attention, everyone.

587
00:20:55,291 --> 00:21:00,027
Jake Peralta is an amazing
detective/genius.

588
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:02,062
Now, if you'll excuse me,

589
00:21:02,064 --> 00:21:05,198
I have some paperwork
to do.

590
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,601
All right.

591
00:21:07,603 --> 00:21:10,070
Officer in the 92nd got
the royal baby mugger.

592
00:21:10,072 --> 00:21:11,605
He had 19 wallets
in his diaper.

593
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:15,008
We got a runner!

594
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,910
Waahhh!

595
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:19,179
Damn!

596
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:20,981
Oh, I didn't tell you.

597
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,183
I got kicked out
of ballet school

598
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:27,220
for beating the crap
out of ballerinas.

599
00:21:27,222 --> 00:21:29,156
It's a good thing we gave him
a heads up.

600
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:32,292
Team effort.
Go Nine-Nine.

601
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:34,361
Not a doctor. Shh.
