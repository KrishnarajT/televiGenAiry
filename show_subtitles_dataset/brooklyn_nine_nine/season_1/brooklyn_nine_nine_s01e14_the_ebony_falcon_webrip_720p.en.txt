1
00:00:02,744 --> 00:00:04,487
Morning, Scully.
How was your weekend?

2
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:08,591
Oh, fun. Kelly and I hit
the park, went for a long walk.

3
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,059
Fell asleep watching TV.

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,996
Oh. Sounds like a fun
weekend with Kelly.

5
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:17,066
So, Kelly. Is that
Scully's wife or his dog?

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,034
Wait.

7
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:20,236
No one knows Scully's wife's name?

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,704
I think Kelly is his dog.

9
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:23,472
Went for a long walk.
That's what you do with a dog.

10
00:00:23,507 --> 00:00:25,674
You can go on a long walk with a person.

11
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:26,909
At sunset.

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,011
Talking about nothing.
And everything.

13
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:31,847
Sounds awful.
Hit the park. That's a dog.

14
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:34,583
My wife takes the babies
to the park all the time.

15
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:36,418
All right, we're doing this.

16
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:37,686
Let's play "wife or dog."

17
00:00:37,687 --> 00:00:39,822
Hey, so Scully,

18
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:41,957
what do you do at the park with Kelly?

19
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,492
Oh, we just walk around.

20
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:45,694
She gets antsy if she doesn't
get outside enough.

21
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:48,731
And then it's just
yap, yap, yap, all day long.

22
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:51,600
Hey,
what's Kelly's favorite food?

23
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,637
Peanut butter. She'll eat it
right out of the jar.

24
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,838
How old is Kelly again?

25
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:57,106
Well, she's getting up there,

26
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,941
but she's pretty spry for her age.

27
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:01,043
Especially considering she got
hit by that car a year ago.

28
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:02,711
Oh, that's so awful.

29
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,547
Was she chasing something
into the street, or...

30
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:07,049
No. Just getting me
the newspaper.

31
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,751
All right, this is useless.

32
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:10,313
Scully, is Kelly your wife or your dog?

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,889
How can you ask me that?

34
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,791
I still don't know which it is.

35
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,860
Could be either.
I could not tell you.

36
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:21,657
Sync & corrections by Rafael UPD
web dl sync snarry

37
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:39,415
Okay, what do you got?

38
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,417
Yup.

39
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,218
Oh, sir, are you looking for your glasses?

40
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:45,421
I borrowed them to do
an impression of you.

41
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:46,422
It killed.

42
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:49,091
Peralta, give me my glasses.

43
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,327
Peralta, give me back my glasses.

44
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,428
Okay.

45
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:53,963
All right, lay out the steroids case.

46
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:55,564
It's a major operation.

47
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:56,799
And one of the biggest
black market distributors

48
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,100
in all of Brooklyn.

49
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:01,770
And it's centered at a gym
called Brooklyn total body.

50
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,822
The center of our investigation
is a guy named Brandon jacoby.

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,675
He did seven years at Rikers for assault.

52
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,847
We spent two weeks undercover
infiltrating the gym.

53
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:14,216
"Gym-filtrating" it.
I coined that.

54
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,952
I think it'll really catch on
if more people infiltrated gyms.

55
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:20,155
We believe that jacoby can
link us to the distributors,

56
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:22,658
but he only talks to trainers
and other muscle heads.

57
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,593
So we want to bring in the sarge.

58
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:26,328
His name will be Trent Carter.

59
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,663
A personal trainer, bouncer,

60
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:30,332
and assistant manager at petsmart.

61
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,067
It's the economy.
What can you do?

62
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:33,769
Gentlemen, have a seat.

63
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,071
Sergeant Jeffords is just
getting back in the field.

64
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,072
What if he panics again?

65
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:38,941
Why is everyone so worried
about the sarge?

66
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,943
I mean, he saved your life
at the rail yard.

67
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:43,812
Okay. It's your case.

68
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:45,581
But if anything goes wrong, it's on you.

69
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:48,183
Trust me, the sergeant will be fine.

70
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:50,185
If you want to worry about
anyone panicking in the field

71
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:51,286
it should be Boyle.

72
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:53,322
Damn straight.

73
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,523
Wait, why'd high five that?

74
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:56,125
'Cause you're a sucker for a high five.

75
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:59,294
Damn straight I am.

76
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,664
Captain, I need a favor.

77
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,766
My apartment got broken into last night.

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,534
Gina, that's terrible.
Are you okay?

79
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:07,870
I'm fine, but I suffered the loss

80
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,672
of many treasured items.

81
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,374
Such as my grandma's jewelry, some cash,

82
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:17,246
and this very fancy gown
with, like, a magic eye print.

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,548
Do you have any connections
in the FBI or CIA?

84
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,184
There's no one else I can
turn to to solve this crime.

85
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:23,686
Gina, you work in a police precinct.

86
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:24,687
You can turn to anyone here.

87
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:26,488
You think these buffoons can help?

88
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:27,523
They're buffoons.

89
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,024
They are not buffoons.

90
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,560
Try the heel.

91
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,697
Still don't feel anything.

92
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:37,466
Awesome. I wish I had
nerve damage.

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,702
Some of them are buffoons.

94
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:41,870
But I'll find the non-buffoons
to investigate.

95
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,873
Could you ask Scully
to return my thumbtacks?

96
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:46,575
I already put 'em in a biohazard bag

97
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,043
and tossed 'em in the furnace.

98
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,078
Good call.

99
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:50,779
You ready, sarge?

100
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,947
I was born ready.

101
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,149
And then I was not born ready for a while,

102
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,718
but now I'm back to being born ready.

103
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,287
Yes! The ebony falcon
soars again.

104
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,621
The ebony falcon.

105
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,590
His feathers are muscles.

106
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:03,826
Let's talk strategy
later tonight at my house.

107
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,894
My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.

108
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,229
But you're ready for this, right?

109
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,664
Absolutely.

110
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:12,067
I just need to put my precious
babies to bed with a story.

111
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,871
The ebony falcon needs
to read go, dog, go.

112
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,106
Yeah, he does.

113
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:18,957
Terry Jeffords is back!
Chest bump me.

114
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:19,975
You don't want to do this, man.

115
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:20,976
No, I really do.

116
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,077
It hurts you every time.

117
00:04:22,112 --> 00:04:23,212
No, I know, but I'm fired up.

118
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:24,513
The adrenaline is gonna carry me through.

119
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,581
Here we go.

120
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:33,689
No signs of forced entry at the door.

121
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,090
But the window was jimmied.

122
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:36,425
You don't have locks on your windows.

123
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,860
Way to blame the victim.

124
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,262
Sorry I'm not rich like you, miss 1%.

125
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:43,165
They cost $8.
You have a fur bedspread.

126
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,467
Why do you have so many lycra bodysuits?

127
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:48,103
And why do you need eight
full drawers of underwear?

128
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:50,105
Because I'm civilized.

129
00:04:50,106 --> 00:04:52,241
Less talky-talk,
more solvey-solve.

130
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,309
We need an itemized list
of everything that was stolen.

131
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:55,911
I already gave it to Captain Holt.

132
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:59,782
$160 in cash, one TV,

133
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,484
one large painting
of a naked lady on a lion,

134
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,120
one set of Joseph Gordon-levitt
nesting dolls...

135
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,121
Wow.

136
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:08,123
Homemade and irreplaceable.

137
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,858
One music box that plays

138
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,628
she works hard for the money when opened.

139
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:13,862
One knockoff designer clutch...

140
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,464
Can't you just buy another knockoff?

141
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,533
No, I can't, silly sue.

142
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,002
'Cause the label no longer
makes the original,

143
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:22,304
so the sweatshop no longer
makes the knockoff.

144
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:25,140
Can you estimate the value
of everything that was taken?

145
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:30,112
Emotionally, $700 million.

146
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,515
Somebody at the door.
Yeah.

147
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:34,515
Hey, sarge.

148
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,385
Sorry about the mess.

149
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:37,519
Hi, Cagney. Hi, Lacey.

150
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:40,189
Hey, your kids like
the same kind of cereal as me.

151
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,490
Well, we just finished story time.

152
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,358
I'm gonna kiss
the girls night-night,

153
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,027
then we can get down to business.

154
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,362
All right,
time for night-night, girls.

155
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:50,165
He is so strong but so gentle.

156
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,935
He's like an enormous,
muscular Ellen Degeneres.

157
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:55,537
You know, I just want to let you guys know

158
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:58,207
that I love you girls so, so muc

159
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,008
okay? So sleep tight.

160
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:03,111
You know, daddy will never
leave you, right, girls?

161
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:04,847
Night-night, daddy.

162
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:08,050
Gosh. Really makes you
understand what he went through.

163
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,718
I'm worried about Terry.

164
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:12,921
We can't let anything bad happen to him.

165
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:16,710
Jake, where are you?

166
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:20,113
In here.

167
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,515
Oh...

168
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:23,417
This is a classy tepee.

169
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,285
Should we get these
instead of desks at work?

170
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,787
We have to get Terry off this case.

171
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:27,888
What? Why?

172
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:29,256
Look, I thought he was a weirdo

173
00:06:29,257 --> 00:06:31,425
for having his year-long
freak-out, but I get it now.

174
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:33,894
He has children. What happens
to them if he gets hurt?

175
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:35,162
I'll have to take care of them.

176
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:37,965
Or his wife or other family
or his more mature friends,

177
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,299
but interesting point.

178
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,801
Why is this just hitting you now?

179
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,803
I don't know, I guess I just
hadn't seen his kids in so long

180
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:45,105
he never takes them around
the precinct for some reason.

181
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,974
Because of
all the guns and danger.

182
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,243
If you have concerns, maybe you
should talk to Terry about it.

183
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:50,944
No. And you can't either.

184
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,446
If he finds out we're worried about him,

185
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:53,847
it'll get in his head and freak him out.

186
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,215
He'll lose his edge and panic.

187
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,017
Yeah, that's why I've never
tried to develop an edge.

188
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,285
You can't lose what you don't have.

189
00:06:58,286 --> 00:06:59,286
No surprises.

190
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:00,387
What are you guys talking about?

191
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:01,922
Work. International
taxes and tariffs.

192
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,523
Work.

193
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:04,524
Heh.

194
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,759
So...

195
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,127
What's the plan at the gym?

196
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,328
Well, I say
we slow-play it.

197
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,329
You know?

198
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,430
Do a little more setup,

199
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,765
a little surveillance,

200
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,434
wait a couple months and see
if they turn themselves in.

201
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,370
Listen, man, I know
everybody's worried about me

202
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:18,171
being psychologically ready for this.

203
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,940
But I promise you I am.

204
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,308
No matter what happens,

205
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:22,976
no matter how many bullets are flying,

206
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,779
I'm gonna be right there
in the middle of everything.

207
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,681
I got your back.

208
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:31,385
No, it's not even that,
you know, it's just...

209
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:33,220
Well, frankly, I'm not so sure
that everyone at the gym

210
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,621
is gonna buy you as a trainer.

211
00:07:34,656 --> 00:07:36,536
You've been sitting behind
that desk for so long

212
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,858
you've gotten a little tubby.

213
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,926
Right? It's like,
love handle alert!

214
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,428
Do you have a bone there somehow?

215
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:45,599
Jake, I promise.
I'm good.

216
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,034
Oops.

217
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:50,437
I gotta put this stuffed giraffe
between my two girls.

218
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:53,907
They both like to snuggle
against his head.

219
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,142
Here comes Mr. snuggles.

220
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:57,678
Here comes
Mr. snuggles.

221
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:01,782
Okay, thanks.

222
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,484
Crime tech report from
your apartment came back.

223
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,053
Apparently they found a strand of hair

224
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:07,554
belonging to Mario Lopez.

225
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,656
I bought a lock of his hair at an auction.

226
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,825
That's cool it's real.

227
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,193
What'd they say about the prints?

228
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,895
None of the partials returned any matches.

229
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:17,364
Nobody in your building
saw anything. We've hit a wall.

230
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:18,732
So what do we do next?

231
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,801
Do I just look for another apartment?

232
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:22,636
Should I buy a handgun?

233
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:24,237
Should I buy a shotgun?

234
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,439
Should I buy an uzi?

235
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:28,075
Look, Gina, we've done all we can.

236
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:29,676
This is how it goes with most B and es.

237
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,745
All right.

238
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,081
C'est la vie. Let me grab
your badge numbers.

239
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,382
'Cause I will be filing

240
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:37,484
an official civilian
complaint with the Captain.

241
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,622
Why did I just receive

242
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,984
a civilian complaint about you two?

243
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,492
I can answer this.

244
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:47,627
Because your assistant is a goblin.

245
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:49,096
Captain, we swept the scene,
ran the prints,

246
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,300
canvassed the building.
We followed procedure.

247
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:57,904
"Procedure" is just a fancy word
for proper order to do things.

248
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,873
Yes, that is it's definition.

249
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,942
This is a miscarriage of justice.

250
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,777
I'm gonna haunt your dreams.

251
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,320
You sure you can lift this much weight?

252
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:15,222
Are you kidding me?

253
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,758
I was the strongest kid in
my camp seven summers in a row.

254
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,092
It would've been eight

255
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:20,861
if that freak Rebecca Lobelman
hadn't showed up.

256
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,096
Let's put in work.

257
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:24,097
And here we go.

258
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,132
One.

259
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:26,800
And I'm done. That's it.

260
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,802
Oh, good rep.
Don't wanna get too bulky.

261
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,171
Two things.

262
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:33,206
First, this gym's wipe-down
policy is criminally lax.

263
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:34,374
So I rewrote it.

264
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,842
Second, I lowered the temperature

265
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,377
of the water fountain by two degrees.

266
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,912
Still waiting on feedback,

267
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,548
but I see a lot of refreshed faces.

268
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:43,110
Also Brandon jacoby should be here soon.

269
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:45,118
How was that not one of your two things?

270
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,820
I gave his regular trainer the day off,

271
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:49,055
I told him Trent would be filling in.

272
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,925
It was an interesting interaction.

273
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,694
Well, according to my new
cloud-based scheduling system,

274
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:57,464
your trainer is out,
and Trent will be filling in.

275
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,538
I spent 40 minutes making that
water bottle pyramid display.

276
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,006
This guy is a psycho.

277
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,808
You know the best way
to deal with psychos.

278
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:10,744
The silent treatment. We should
draw him out by not engaging.

279
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,179
Nope.

280
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,314
The longer we wait the more
likely our cover gets blown.

281
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,782
I'll make contact.

282
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,150
Okay, but just remember.

283
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:19,753
You're not Terry.
You're Trent.

284
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:23,990
Trainer and known hemophiliac,
so be careful.

285
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,960
Trent is also a quaker who
avoids violence at all costs.

286
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,866
You Trent?

287
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:36,937
Yup. A black Trent.
One of many.

288
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:38,705
What do you want to start with today?

289
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,607
Weights.

290
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:42,409
Excuse me, sir.
Can I borrow this machine?

291
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,478
I need to be here to keep
an eye on a friend.

292
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,148
Hold on. I'm on my last set.

293
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,149
Okay.

294
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:53,086
Two...

295
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,521
Three...

296
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:56,056
Can you go any faster?

297
00:10:56,057 --> 00:10:57,257
I mean, what do you need
leg muscles for anyway?

298
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:58,592
You're, like, 100 years old.

299
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:00,727
Socially acceptable for you
to roll around on a scooter.

300
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:04,030
I lost the count.

301
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,031
One.

302
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,031
One?

303
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:08,568
You're not even moving.
Let's go.

304
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,237
Get your hands off me!

305
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:11,938
I've heard about this in the news!

306
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,807
You're cyber-bullying me!
Shh!

307
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,342
I'm getting the manager!
Get the hell away from me!

308
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,744
No, you're very misinformed.
Please don't...

309
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,045
Damn it.

310
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:32,705
Hey. Have you seen Terry?
I lost him.

311
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:34,640
His children could be orphans already.

312
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:36,843
Fatherless,
mother-having orphans.

313
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:38,678
I'm sure he's fine.

314
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,580
I think the bigger issue
is the complaint I received

315
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,948
from an older gentleman

316
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,683
saying you tried to
hurry him off his machine,

317
00:11:43,684 --> 00:11:45,351
in open defiance of gym protocol.

318
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:46,552
Don't do this.

319
00:11:46,553 --> 00:11:49,055
I know we're friends,
but if you do that again,

320
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,356
I'm gonna have to suspend your membership.

321
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,624
What have you become?

322
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:53,092
Me. I've become me.

323
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:54,093
What?

324
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:55,695
Oh, sarge, thank God.

325
00:11:55,696 --> 00:11:57,163
Where were you?
What happened?

326
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:00,333
Nothing happened. Jacoby wanted
to do wind sprints outside.

327
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:03,135
You know, he's a mean dude,
but I think I'm making progress.

328
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:05,505
He asked to borrow
my squat belt, I told him no,

329
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:06,806
he respected that.

330
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,475
Okay, but let's build up
that relationship slowly, okay?

331
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:12,011
We don't want to
jump the gun and spook him.

332
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:16,282
'Sup?
Good workout.

333
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:19,485
You know, it's weird I never
worked out with you before.

334
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:20,926
What'd you say your regular gym was?

335
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:24,490
I didn't.
Brooklyn bulk fitness.

336
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:26,926
I work out there too.

337
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,595
Never heard of any Trent.

338
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,931
I don't know why.
I work out there all the time.

339
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:34,400
Really? Starting when?

340
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:36,702
NYPD, hands on your head!
My God, you're gigantic.

341
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:39,305
What are you doing, Peralta?
You just blew my cover!

342
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:40,907
Or did I save your life?

343
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,109
Or did you compromise an investigation

344
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,911
and piss off a superior officer?

345
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:47,079
I'm sensing from your tone it's that one.

346
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,749
I need some afternoon coffee.

347
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:51,984
What's the matter with you?

348
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:55,054
Gina came by my house last night
to go over the case.

349
00:12:55,055 --> 00:12:58,124
Between us doing that and her
using my bread maker all night,

350
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,359
I didn't get much sleep.

351
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,628
I will say she makes a wonderful rye.

352
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:04,864
So dense, yet so moist.

353
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:06,866
Hello, ladies.

354
00:13:06,867 --> 00:13:08,601
Since you have allowed crime to win,

355
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:12,872
I've hired a private
investigator to solve my case.

356
00:13:12,873 --> 00:13:14,774
Say hello to Leo Sporm.

357
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:17,810
A P.I.?
These guys are hacks.

358
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:20,446
How do you know if your
husband's a murderer?

359
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,548
You don't.

360
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,283
Call Leo now.

361
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:26,118
Leo Sporm.

362
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,453
How's business?

363
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:28,487
You know this guy?

364
00:13:28,488 --> 00:13:29,622
Everyone knows him.

365
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:31,791
The Picasso of hucksters.

366
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,292
I like that.

367
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:36,128
"Look up who Picasso is."

368
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:37,597
Sporm. Out.

369
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:40,299
Now.

370
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,500
You blew our cover, man!

371
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:43,836
Now I gotta go into an
interrogation with no evidence

372
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:46,105
and try to get jacoby
to rat out his distributors!

373
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,640
I'm sorry, I got jumpy.

374
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:49,575
I wasn't thinking straight.
It was all the exercise.

375
00:13:49,576 --> 00:13:51,477
The blood from my head
rushed into my delts.

376
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:54,380
Point to your delts, Jake.

377
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:56,282
There is...

378
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:57,817
You didn't have to hop in there, man.

379
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,786
I can handle this.

380
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:01,787
What's my name?

381
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:02,788
Terry Jeffords.

382
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,323
What is my name?

383
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:05,357
The ebony falcon.

384
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:07,259
And what does the ebony falcon do?

385
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,162
Takes every precaution to
ensure his own safety?

386
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:12,632
Takes bad guys to jail
and bad girls to bed.

387
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,066
Hell yeah, he does.

388
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,768
Except now the ebony falcon is monogamous

389
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,770
and too tired for sex,
so his only indulgence

390
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:22,775
is fresh fruit yogurt parfaits.

391
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:24,644
Terry loves yogurt.

392
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:26,679
How's it going?

393
00:14:26,713 --> 00:14:28,848
Well, so far jacoby
hasn't given anything up,

394
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:30,316
but I think Terry's
starting to get to him.

395
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,484
I'm not talking.

396
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:33,319
You're talking right now!

397
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,453
Boom!

398
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:38,324
I'm already in your head.

399
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:39,825
Sarge is safe in there,

400
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:41,527
so the longer this
interrogation goes the better.

401
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,529
We gotta solve the case before he does.

402
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,431
Hey, tell me about that new
system you set up at the gym

403
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:46,799
for scheduling appointments.

404
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,934
I've been waiting so long
to hear you say those words.

405
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:50,202
Come with me.

406
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:54,140
Experience the future
of cloud-based scheduling.

407
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:55,307
Okay.

408
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:57,543
I put all the trainers' schedules

409
00:14:57,544 --> 00:14:59,311
into a shared online calendar.

410
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:01,480
Aside from the cucumber water
at the front desk,

411
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:03,716
it's probably my greatest
accomplishment ever.

412
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:05,685
Hang on a sec.
Who's this guy?

413
00:15:05,686 --> 00:15:07,386
Says he's a personal trainer at the gym,

414
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:09,055
but he has no regular hours.

415
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:10,589
He always makes
last-minute appointments,

416
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,958
always in the boxing area,
and always late at night.

417
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,860
And look who he trains.

418
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:16,028
Brandon jacoby.

419
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:17,430
That's probably our supplier.

420
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:19,732
We should set up a buy
from this Vladimir Rincic.

421
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,568
All right. We should set up
a tactical team and hit the gym.

422
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,003
And sergeant Jeffries should stay here

423
00:15:24,004 --> 00:15:26,105
and keep interrogating jacoby
for as many hours

424
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:27,873
or years as necessary.

425
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:29,508
Are you sure I shouldn't go get him?

426
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,844
I feel a little uncomfortable
leaving him out of this.

427
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,179
Don't think of it as leaving him out

428
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,247
so much as including his babies
in having a father.

429
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:36,348
Let's go.

430
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:37,349
Detectives.

431
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,451
Where are you going?

432
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:40,352
Just headed out to close the steroid case.

433
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:42,555
Isn't sergeant Jeffries
interrogating the suspect now?

434
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:43,956
Yup, he's got that locked up.

435
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:45,624
We're following up on this lead.

436
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,893
The whole team is running
smoothly and perfectly

437
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:52,064
like a well-lubed,
oiled time clock... bye.

438
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:54,867
Why do you think
Gina hired that P.I.?

439
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:56,102
To mock us.

440
00:15:56,136 --> 00:15:58,270
She's scared.

441
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,638
She's not scared.

442
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,775
With all due respect, sir,
Gina has no feelings.

443
00:16:02,776 --> 00:16:04,844
She once said the best comedy of all time

444
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:06,779
was the girl with the dragon tattoo.

445
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,614
Well, think about how she's been acting.

446
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:10,616
Gina came by my house last night.

447
00:16:10,617 --> 00:16:11,951
Do I buy an uzi?

448
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:14,920
I asked for a police officer
to escort me to work,

449
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:17,022
and it took a while
for dispatch to find me

450
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:19,291
a young Kevin costner type.

451
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,228
Her home doesn't feel safe anymore.

452
00:16:22,229 --> 00:16:23,729
If someone broke into your apartment

453
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,398
and you weren't cops,
wouldn't you be scared?

454
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,501
Yes.

455
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:30,970
Depends. How many guns
do I still have hidden?

456
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:31,971
None.

457
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:34,507
Do I still have my knife?
Nunchucks?

458
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:35,808
Axe?

459
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:38,244
It was a hypothetical question.

460
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:40,045
I know, but I want to play it out.

461
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:41,914
Do I still have my throwing stars?

462
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:44,450
This has taken a strange turn.

463
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:46,619
Fine. I'd be scared.

464
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,954
We're on it.

465
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:51,257
What kind of woman doesn't have an axe?

466
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,161
All right, we're all set for the sting.

467
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:57,129
We got hidden cameras, wireless mics,

468
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,831
and tactical teams by all the exits.

469
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:01,000
I told Vladimir to meet Vance Vandervaven,

470
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,668
a.K.A. me, here at 10:00.

471
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:04,336
Said that I was filling in for jacoby.

472
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,172
You and I will be sparring
when he arrives.

473
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:08,407
Cool.
I boxed at the academy.

474
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,176
They invented a new weight class for me.

475
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:13,012
You're looking at the undisputed
bubbleweight champion.

476
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:14,346
Hey! Peralta!

477
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,148
Boyle!
Sarge, hey.

478
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:17,917
I'm so psyched you
made it here to the sting

479
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:20,853
that I definitely told
Charles to tell you about.

480
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:21,854
You lied to me!

481
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:23,355
I can see that you're upset,

482
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:24,957
but let's just sit down and talk about it.

483
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,359
Done talking!

484
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,562
Time to dance.

485
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:31,630
Fine. But I should warn you.

486
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:33,332
I took three years of tap.

487
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:40,862
Again, sarge, it's so good to see you.

488
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:43,264
Just out of curiosity,
how did you find out about this?

489
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:46,568
I'm a Detective sergeant in the NYPD.

490
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,404
Holt told me. Why are you
cutting me out of the operation?

491
00:17:49,438 --> 00:17:51,072
What? That's crazy!

492
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,373
Boyle, come in here
and stand in front of my body

493
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:54,075
and tell him that's crazy.

494
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:56,110
My lucky face!

495
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:57,846
You gonna talk to me now?

496
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,048
Sure. If you could be
any vacation...

497
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:01,082
Oh!

498
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,484
You didn't let me finish.

499
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:05,620
If you could be any vacation,
what would you be?

500
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:06,754
I'd be skiing.

501
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,089
Oh, now I'm gonna hit you for real.

502
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:09,924
That wasn't for real?
Oh, my God.

503
00:18:09,925 --> 00:18:10,892
No, wait, wait, wait!
I was worried!

504
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:12,927
Worried about what?

505
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:15,129
About you getting hurt.

506
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,598
I don't want your daughters
growing up without a dad.

507
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,233
I know what that's like, and it sucks.

508
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:19,534
And I don't want it to happen to them.

509
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:21,269
Why didn't you just say something to me?

510
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:23,071
Because I didn't want to get in your head

511
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:25,506
and have you freak out again.

512
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:27,342
Yeah, I get it.

513
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:28,910
It's been a rough year.

514
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:32,480
But I've learned to embrace my
fears. It makes me a better cop.

515
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:33,514
Tacs one and two are set.

516
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:34,549
30 minutes until the bogeys arrive.

517
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,884
Thanks, Boyle.

518
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:38,453
I love it when
you say "bogeys."

519
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:39,654
So we good?

520
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:42,257
We good.

521
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:44,025
And for the record...

522
00:18:44,026 --> 00:18:46,327
If I could be any kind of vacation...

523
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:47,595
I'd be lake trip.

524
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,930
Classic.

525
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:51,532
You're here late.

526
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:53,668
You know me.
I love working.

527
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:55,436
Can't tear me away from my work.

528
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:59,407
I just love requisitions
and corporate record reports.

529
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:02,810
Just, you know,
messages from people for Holt.

530
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:05,513
I can imagine
how frightening this must be.

531
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:06,915
I'm sorry we didn't catch the guy.

532
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:08,583
Yeah. It's weird.

533
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:10,018
It's like, why do the worst things

534
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,253
always happen to the best people?

535
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:14,355
And what's to keep it
from happening again?

536
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,858
We are. Come on.
We're taking you home.

537
00:19:16,892 --> 00:19:18,293
Really?

538
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:24,198
We installed a second lock
on your front door,

539
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:26,267
put locks on the windows
by the fire escape,

540
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:27,535
and set all your lights on timers.

541
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:29,904
That makes me feel so much better.

542
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:30,972
Thank you, guys.

543
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:33,141
And as a token of my appreciation,

544
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:36,344
I would like to give you...

545
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,344
These.

546
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:39,314
Great.

547
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:41,149
The cool thing is you can
eat whatever you want.

548
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,651
These are right there with you.

549
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:50,725
Hey!

550
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,560
You Vance Vandervaven?

551
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:56,364
Yeah. That's me.
I'll be right there.

552
00:19:56,398 --> 00:19:57,398
You gonna let me do this, man?

553
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,700
What choice do I have?

554
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,735
You hit me in the arms so hard
they no longer work.

555
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,472
All right. It's time
to catch some bad guys.

556
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:05,907
It good to be back.

557
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:07,875
Have a fun steroid deal, sergeant.

558
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,243
You're a weird guy, Jake.

559
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:10,445
Yeah.

560
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,884
The ebony falcon.
No.

561
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,020
The ebony falcon had no fear.

562
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,289
He's the ebony antelope now.

563
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,191
Brave enough to drink at the lake,

564
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:26,294
but wise enough to run from the lions.

565
00:20:26,295 --> 00:20:28,529
Hey, my arms don't work.
Can you scratch my nose?

566
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,898
You bet.

567
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:32,233
Yeah. Thank you.

568
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,036
Morning, Captain.

569
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,939
So? How did
sergeant Jeffries do?

570
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:39,974
Why is everyone so worried
about the sarge?

571
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:41,042
He was amazing.

572
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:42,677
He made the buy, took out the suppliers,

573
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:44,718
but wisely didn't take on
more than he could handle.

574
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:47,682
I left one for you.

575
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:49,250
And you'll be happy to know

576
00:20:49,251 --> 00:20:51,119
that he punched me
in the face several times.

577
00:20:51,153 --> 00:20:52,253
That does make me happy.

578
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:55,089
Guess we're being candid today.

579
00:20:57,526 --> 00:20:58,760
Hey, sarge,

580
00:20:58,794 --> 00:21:00,261
just for the record,

581
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:02,363
I hope you're on every case with
me for the rest of my career.

582
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:04,766
I'm not scared for you at all.

583
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:06,034
Of you a lot.

584
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:08,569
Thanks, Jake.

585
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:11,539
Oh, Peralta, I almost forgot.

586
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,840
My girls made you a card.

587
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,375
To thank you for keeping me safe.

588
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:16,177
Oh...

589
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,246
They're so full of potential.

590
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:22,750
Why would you show me this?

591
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:26,838
