1
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:06,560
Ah, Captain.
You're at my desk.

2
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:08,323
Just what I wanna see
first thing in the morning.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,232
You're three minutes late,
Peralta.

4
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:12,834
Not my fault.
I had a plumbing problem.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,482
Which reminds me,
I'm gonna need

6
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:21,118
a new
departmentally issued phone.

7
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:23,087
Oh, come on, really?
I'm a few minutes late,

8
00:00:23,088 --> 00:00:24,506
so you're gonna call me out
in front of everyone?

9
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,550
Good idea.
Everyone?

10
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:29,305
Gather round, so I can call out
Peralta in front of you.

11
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,517
Okay, fine.
I was three minutes late.

12
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,255
I'm sorry for doing
one thing wrong.

13
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,768
- Oh, it's more than one thing.
- Uh-oh.

14
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:37,894
Let's start
with the Kristov murder.

15
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:39,198
It was
an amazing solve.

16
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,468
I got him to confess
in 20 minutes.

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:41,905
You also mislabeled
the evidence,

18
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,945
so that confession
is worthless

19
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,718
if the sergeant
hadn't caught your mistake.

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,621
Here are three cases
with sloppy paperwork.

21
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,425
Here are two pictures.

22
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:51,061
One is your locker.

23
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:54,104
The other is a garbage dump
in the Philippines.

24
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:58,846
Can you tell
which is which?

25
00:00:58,847 --> 00:01:01,250
- That one's the dump?
- They're both your locker.

26
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:02,819
Gah, I should've guessed that.
He's good.

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,222
This folder is labeled
"undies, dirty."

28
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:08,258
So I won't confuse it
with "undies, clean."

29
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:10,095
Also, who cares
about all these rules?

30
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:12,666
I have more felony arrests
than any other Detective here.

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,269
You also have more mice
living in your desk

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,271
than any other Detective.

33
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:19,306
Algernon.

34
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:21,310
You guys,
Algernon's back.

35
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:24,547
Get rid of the mouse,
and get your act together now.

36
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:28,519
He's grumpy.

37
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,996
Okay, detectives,
let's get started.

38
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,133
Santiago, where are we
with the Jay street drug bust?

39
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,235
There are 12 keys of coke
unaccounted for,

40
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:00,037
but we just got a warrant to
search the dealer's apartment.

41
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,838
Good.
Take Boyle and Diaz.

42
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:03,607
Dream team.

43
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:06,677
Peralta, brief us
on the vandalism case.

44
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,411
Well, there's no easy way
to put this, sarge,

45
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:11,348
but someone has been painting
wieners on squad cars.

46
00:02:12,683 --> 00:02:14,518
And apparently,
they won't stop

47
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,254
until there's a penis drawn
on every cop car in Brooklyn.

48
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:19,091
Oh, that's what
he's been drawing.

49
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:21,427
But what are those little
round things at the bottom?

50
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:22,428
That's the butt.

51
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:24,198
The butt?

52
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,035
I assume you have a plan
to catch this gentleman.

53
00:02:27,036 --> 00:02:29,071
Did you just
say "genital-man"?

54
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,576
Because if so, kudos,
and yes, I have a plan.

55
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:34,048
I'm gonna plant
a decoy squad car as bait.

56
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:38,052
Meanwhile, I'll be waiting
in an undercover vehicle here.

57
00:02:38,053 --> 00:02:40,756
He's already tagged
three U/C vehicles.

58
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:43,461
He can clearly spot 'em.
You should take my minivan.

59
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:45,333
- A minivan?
- A-ha!

60
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:50,239
You all got a problem
with my minivan?

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,642
'Cause my wife
doesn't like it either.

62
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:54,743
She wanted an SUV,
but those things roll, man.

63
00:02:54,744 --> 00:02:56,512
They roll!

64
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:58,146
That's a good idea, sergeant.
We'll take the van.

65
00:02:58,147 --> 00:02:59,780
We?
You're coming with me?

66
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:02,583
Sir, with all due respect,
I don't need backup.

67
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:05,250
It's not backup.
It's babysitting.

68
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,517
- Babysitting.
- A-ha!

69
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,920
Oh, look at this.

70
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:13,021
The drug dealer
got a B.A. in art history

71
00:03:13,022 --> 00:03:14,689
from Brooklyn college.

72
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,690
Interesting, huh?

73
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:17,523
How's that interesting?

74
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:19,994
Well, it's surprising
because you would think

75
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:22,701
he had studied... drugs.

76
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,539
I studied
art history too.

77
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,440
- Also not interesting.
- Excuse me.

78
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:28,773
I know I'm just
a lowly civilian administrator,

79
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:30,707
but I couldn't
help overhearing

80
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,275
you're looking
for some missing drugs?

81
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:35,443
As it turns out,
my friend here, Carlene,

82
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:38,846
is a psychic,
and she's ready to help you.

83
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,447
I do palms, tarot,

84
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:42,885
and I have a degree
in numerology from the Internet.

85
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,655
- Ugh.
- Really, Gina?

86
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:46,722
- A psychic?
- What? She's the real deal.

87
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:48,856
E.G., last week,
she predicted

88
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:51,493
I would have
a sensuous encounter

89
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:53,129
with a guy named Mark.

90
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,368
And I did.

91
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:01,675
Is anyone here
named Mark?

92
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,010
You're good.

93
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,748
Okay, she's had visions
which, frankly,

94
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:07,483
science cannot account for.

95
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:10,085
Also, she can get you
amazing deals

96
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:11,820
on ladies' footwear.

97
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:15,021
She's assistant manager
at Leonard's designer shoes.

98
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:18,558
Vision.
The drugs are in a location.

99
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,427
I see the color blue...
She sees blue.

100
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,995
And yellow.

101
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:25,531
And I see the letter
"L", "R", "S", "T", "W", "E",

102
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,231
and "B."

103
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:29,331
So basically, everyone's
first eight guesses in hangman?

104
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:31,164
Thank you, Carlene.

105
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:34,335
Your entire life
is garbage.

106
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:36,204
So Holt's coming
on my stakeout now?

107
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:38,605
I made a mixtape with
some very explicit rap on it,

108
00:04:38,606 --> 00:04:40,508
and now I can't sing along.
You made a mixtape?

109
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:41,875
Yes, I still listen
to cassettes.

110
00:04:41,876 --> 00:04:43,374
This guy is all over me.

111
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,041
I mean, a Captain
on a minor vandalism case?

112
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,343
It's insane.

113
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:48,279
What's insane
is how you refuse

114
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,614
to get with the program.

115
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,082
There is a new sheriff
in town, Jake.

116
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,948
Well, I like
the old sheriff.

117
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:54,748
I mean, McGintley wouldn't care
about a messy desk

118
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:56,315
or all these stupid rules.

119
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:59,117
Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase...
Hey!

120
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:00,518
What the hell's
going on here?

121
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,086
Science experiment.

122
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:04,055
I wanna see what happens
if I taser this cantaloupe.

123
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:05,458
Okay.

124
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,195
Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase...

125
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:08,797
Ah!

126
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:14,074
Yeah!

127
00:05:14,075 --> 00:05:16,277
And McGintley wouldn't care
if I was three minutes late

128
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:19,213
'cause he was always
an hour late and hungover,

129
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,982
and he would let you do
literally anything you want

130
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:22,284
if you gave him
a hamburger.

131
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:23,487
Did he let you play
your mixtape?

132
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,223
Okay.
That's very funny.

133
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:27,658
Get an iPod, man.

134
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:28,892
Mixtape.

135
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:30,426
I just want
to apologize

136
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,561
for my fellow
Detective's behavior.

137
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:37,065
Okay, my granny
also had the gift.

138
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:40,331
I feel
that I will die soon.

139
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:43,401
She was right.
She died two years later.

140
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:47,237
Your sincere belief in my gift
means a great deal.

141
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,171
Vision.

142
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,372
The woman you love,
the one you work with,

143
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:53,307
the scary one
with the black hair...

144
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:54,709
- Rosa.
- Yes?

145
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,110
She doesn't
love you back.

146
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:58,146
She will never
love you back.

147
00:05:58,147 --> 00:05:59,414
Say "thank you," Charles.

148
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:01,082
She just told you
your future.

149
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,484
Thank you.

150
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:12,128
You left without me.
You were late again.

151
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,032
Well, I had to put on
my undercover minivan disguise.

152
00:06:15,033 --> 00:06:17,434
Say hello
to Harvey Norgenbloom,

153
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:20,472
CPA, recently divorced
father of two

154
00:06:20,473 --> 00:06:23,607
with a dark sexual secret.

155
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:25,943
- What's your cover?
- Angry Captain.

156
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:29,214
Okay, so you do not like
my ensemble.

157
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:31,181
I'm just concerned
that you may find it hard

158
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,717
to pursue a criminal on foot
while wearing man sandals.

159
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,123
But the sandals
define Harvey.

160
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:39,228
He's a sandals guy.

161
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,829
Captain, why the babysitting?
Why are you micromanaging me?

162
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,728
You think I wanna be
sitting here with you

163
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:45,963
instead of running
my precinct?

164
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:47,633
Yes.
It was a rhetorical question.

165
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:49,336
I've spent
the last 12 years

166
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:50,906
fighting
for my first command,

167
00:06:50,907 --> 00:06:52,477
and I'm not gonna
let you screw it up

168
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,313
because you refuse
to take your job seriously.

169
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,715
Hey, I do take
my job seriously.

170
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,550
I put away bad guys.
That's what matters.

171
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,085
Well, so does doing
your paperwork,

172
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,718
showing up on time,
wearing proper footwear.

173
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,487
That's on Harvey.
That's not me.

174
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:04,888
Well, so here's
the deal.

175
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,389
You're gonna have
a superior officer

176
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,492
babysitting you
on every one of your cases.

177
00:07:08,493 --> 00:07:09,927
And when you show me
that you can do your job...

178
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,100
Every part of your job...
Perfectly,

179
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,673
then I'll back off.

180
00:07:15,674 --> 00:07:18,908
Okay.
Counteroffer.

181
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:22,708
I give you 50 bucks, and you
let me do whatever I want.

182
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,747
Fine.
We'll do it your way.

183
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:27,015
From this point on,
I'll do

184
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:29,451
every part
of the job perfectly,

185
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:31,188
perfecter than perfectly.

186
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:34,026
It's "more perfectly."
You said that imperfectly.

187
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:37,293
I was testing you.
You did perfectly.

188
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:39,192
Quick update
on the tagger situation...

189
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,259
He is currently spray-painting
our van right now.

190
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,562
Police, freeze!

191
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,463
Ow, ow, ow.

192
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:48,064
Sandal down.

193
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:50,431
Lost a sandal.
NYPD, freeze!

194
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:52,865
I'm here.

195
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,363
You're busted.

196
00:07:54,364 --> 00:07:55,765
Already got him.
We got him.

197
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,673
Oh, hey, Captain.

198
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:06,710
Hi, so I was able to procure
that $50 after all,

199
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,511
and my offer
still stands.

200
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:10,446
Let me do whatever I want,
and the $40...

201
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:12,682
That's how much
I actually have... is yours.

202
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:15,288
No? Fair enough.
I only had 30 anyway.

203
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:16,856
Well, I guess
in order to get you

204
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:18,491
to stop micromanaging me,
I'm gonna have to get back

205
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:20,793
to the most important piece
of police work there is:

206
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,194
Writing a perfect report.

207
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:23,929
Good, I'm anxious
to read it.

208
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:27,469
And I'm anxious to restore
my status as a lone wolf.

209
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,209
Anything else, Detective?

210
00:08:32,243 --> 00:08:33,677
Yeah, I'm gonna do
one more.

211
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,215
Lone wolf.

212
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,818
He's digging me.

213
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:45,653
Hey, sarge, do you know
where we keep the glitter?

214
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:47,653
Just wanna make sure
this report for the Captain

215
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:48,819
is extra sparkly.

216
00:08:48,853 --> 00:08:50,153
What are you doing,
Peralta?

217
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,921
Look, if I have to do things
his way,

218
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,256
I'm gonna do them
my way.

219
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:55,224
Okay, man.

220
00:08:55,225 --> 00:08:57,394
It was nice working with you.

221
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,126
I'm not scared of him,
okay?

222
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,764
I'm not scared
of anyone.

223
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:03,565
Oh, also, the tagger drew
a penis on your minivan.

224
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,399
I'm sorry.
Please don't chase after me.

225
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,946
What?
There's a penis on my minivan?

226
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,505
High ceilings,
three bedrooms.

227
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:13,910
Why does every perp
have a nicer place than I do?

228
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:16,043
You know what they don't
teach you at the academy?

229
00:09:16,044 --> 00:09:17,165
It's better to be
a criminal.

230
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:20,550
Oh, no.
The cabinets are blue.

231
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,354
Tacky.
Not a deal breaker, though.

232
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:23,723
I'd just repaint it.

233
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:25,592
The psychic predicted
the drugs

234
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:26,873
would be found
in something blue.

235
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:30,029
I see the color blue.

236
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,032
She also made this really
depressing prediction

237
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:33,367
about my life.

238
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:36,404
She will never love you back.

239
00:09:36,438 --> 00:09:39,143
And if she's right
about where we find the drugs,

240
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:40,344
that means she's right
about the other thing.

241
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,613
- Uh-huh.
- Kitchen.

242
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:47,754
- Whoa.
- Jackpot.

243
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:49,959
There's way more
than 12 keys in here.

244
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,127
Where was it?

245
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,896
Baseboard,
behind the hamper.

246
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,731
What color
was the hamper?

247
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:55,731
- Green.
- Yes.

248
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:57,065
The clothes hamper
was green.

249
00:09:57,066 --> 00:10:00,137
The clothes hamper was green!

250
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:01,939
Drinks on me.

251
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:03,873
You're weird.

252
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:08,411
Sorry this is
taking so long.

253
00:10:08,412 --> 00:10:09,612
Still writing up
my report.

254
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:11,315
Pretty detailed.

255
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:13,517
Hey, Gina, can you look up
what the humidity was

256
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:15,920
about an hour ago and also
what moon cycle we're in?

257
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:19,225
No, sorry.
Don't feel like it, no.

258
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,428
Thanks, Gina.

259
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,264
And now to you.
What's your name?

260
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:26,133
My name is
banana fartman, md.

261
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,502
I don't believe you.

262
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:29,637
Come on, man.
Just tell me who you are.

263
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:30,971
I need to fill
this thing out perfectly,

264
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:32,740
so my boss
will get off my back.

265
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,076
Are you a minor?
How old are you?

266
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,011
I'm 610.
I'm a highlander.

267
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:37,879
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna put that in there.

268
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,115
And then you're gonna be tried
as an adult highlander.

269
00:10:40,116 --> 00:10:42,317
And they're gonna cut
your head off.

270
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:43,519
Is that what you want?

271
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:45,790
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

272
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,961
but your psychic
friend's predictions

273
00:10:47,962 --> 00:10:49,631
about the drug case
were wrong,

274
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:51,703
which means all
of her predictions are wrong.

275
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:54,805
Mm-mm. No way.
She's never wrong.

276
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:56,839
We found the cocaine
behind a green hamper.

277
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,877
Never said green
or the letter "H."

278
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:01,984
Mm-hmm, she said
"blue" and "yellow," Charles.

279
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,219
I don't know if there's
any kindergarteners present,

280
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,655
but those two colors combined
make green.

281
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:10,460
She also mentioned
the letters "L" and "B,"

282
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:13,799
and another name
for a hamper is...

283
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,836
Lady bin?

284
00:11:16,837 --> 00:11:17,938
Laundry basket.

285
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,675
Oh, little boo-boo.

286
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:22,079
Can you go be depressed
over there?

287
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,581
You're bumming out
my whole area.

288
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:26,815
Baby, I've got
some bad news.

289
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:31,687
Someone painted a giant penis
on our minivan.

290
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:34,456
No, you cannot have
an SUV now.

291
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:36,859
Those things roll, baby.
They roll!

292
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,029
Hey, look at this.

293
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,933
Your prints were
on file.

294
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:44,107
Nice to meet you,
Trevor Podolski.

295
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:49,379
Oh, Podolski, just like deputy
police commissioner Podolski.

296
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,452
Your father is deputy
police commissioner Podolski.

297
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,922
I'm not sure
how things work here,

298
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,993
but does that mean
that your career is in my hands?

299
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:01,731
Okay, you know what?

300
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:02,900
Yes.

301
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,601
20.2 kilos.

302
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:10,902
I feel like
we could round up to 21.

303
00:12:10,936 --> 00:12:14,306
Or we could round down
to 20,

304
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:17,976
take the extra 0.2,
sell it to our friends.

305
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:23,985
I'll call the D.A.
Rosa, you log this in.

306
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:25,587
Charles, maybe watch Gina.

307
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,956
So what are
you doing tonight?

308
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:30,927
Nothing.
What about you...

309
00:12:30,928 --> 00:12:32,263
Are doing tonight?

310
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:35,103
Nothing.

311
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,471
Carlene.

312
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,975
Whelp, I hope you find
something to do.

313
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,148
I'm gonna pee.
That's what I'm doing tonight.

314
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:48,584
No.

315
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,622
Deputy commissioner's son, huh?

316
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:55,457
His decision to target cop cars
makes a lot more sense now.

317
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,824
We gotta let him walk,
right?

318
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,458
He defaced
nine police vehicles,

319
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,758
and you caught him
red-handed.

320
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,790
Why would you let him walk?

321
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,692
Captain, I did all the work
on this perfectly.

322
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:07,761
I mean, my report
has over 25 pages

323
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:10,599
of meticulous research,
diagrams, and maps.

324
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,505
I even put an "about the author"
section on the back.

325
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:15,975
I did everything
you asked me to do,

326
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,443
but this is
above my pay grade.

327
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:18,978
You gotta make the call.

328
00:13:18,979 --> 00:13:22,447
You're the arresting officer.
It's your call.

329
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:24,649
I told you to do
every part of your job,

330
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,119
and making this call
is part of your job.

331
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,624
- Yeah, but you think I should process him.
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,359
Well, if I do,
the deputy commissioner

333
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,894
could ruin my career,
and I'll end up on the streets

334
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,797
selling my beautiful body
for a can of beans.

335
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,500
Mm-hmm.

336
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:40,638
Has anyone ever told you
you look exactly like a statue?

337
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,006
Yes.

338
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:45,710
Man, you were totally right
about the cocaine,

339
00:13:45,711 --> 00:13:47,646
and you were also right
about Rosa.

340
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,381
Who's Rosa?
The woman I...

341
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:51,349
The woman who doesn't
love him back.

342
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,817
Oh.
Yes, that woman.

343
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:54,585
You know, it can be a burden
to always know

344
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,086
what's gonna happen
in the future.

345
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,654
Don't get out
of the chair.

346
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:00,058
I just had a vision
of you leaving this chair

347
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,693
and getting
seriously injured.

348
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,227
Oh, my God.

349
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:05,361
I should probably wheel you
back to your desk.

350
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,496
That is a great idea.
Wheel you off a bridge.

351
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:08,997
I'm kidding.

352
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,330
♪ Oh, you're alone

353
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,834
♪ Uh-oh, you're alone
for life ♪

354
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:15,838
So here are my options.

355
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,440
One, I process
Podolski's kid,

356
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,208
he fires me, and I spend
the rest of my career

357
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,046
as a Detective, third grade,
which is literally pathetic.

358
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:25,819
No offense, Hitchcock.
None taken.

359
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:28,023
Option two,
I let him walk,

360
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:29,258
and I spend the rest
of my life with Holt

361
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,193
as my babysitter.

362
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:33,028
Honestly, when I think about
spending the rest of my life

363
00:14:33,029 --> 00:14:34,529
with a babysitter,

364
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,965
she's kind of a cute blonde
named Erica,

365
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:38,435
and she always has
pizza money

366
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:39,804
and lets me stay up as late
as I want.

367
00:14:39,805 --> 00:14:41,408
How old are you
in this scenario?

368
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,478
Anyway, the point is
Holt cares more

369
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:46,047
about whether I
"do my job right"

370
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:47,750
than whether I have a job
at all.

371
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:49,119
So I'm taking suggestions.

372
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,989
I say piss off Holt,

373
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,991
so we get to watch your career
end right in front of us.

374
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,826
Okay, thank you
for that, Santiago.

375
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,295
I'm gonna put you down
for "don't arrest,"

376
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,797
and I'm also going
to put your phone number

377
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:59,300
on every urinal
in Rikers.

378
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:01,770
Don't arrest him.
Just smack him. Hard.

379
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,238
With a phone book
on a body part

380
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,737
no one can see,
you know what I'm saying?

381
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,639
So you're suggesting
police brutality?

382
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,842
Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah.
Why?

383
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:10,844
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?

384
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:12,415
You want this collar?
Paperwork's all done,

385
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,084
and it's perfect.
The Podolski kid?

386
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:16,919
Are you kidding?
I just gave him my lunch.

387
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,788
Okay.
Boyle, what do you think?

388
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,923
I don't know, man.
I'm lost.

389
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:24,023
The universe is
a cruel and vexing puzzle.

390
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,356
I-I'm at the whim
of the cosmos.

391
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:29,094
All right, I'm gonna put
you down for "bummer,"

392
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,631
and you can hang out in
that category all by yourself.

393
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,332
Hey, everyone.

394
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:39,102
Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy,
angry official here,

395
00:15:39,103 --> 00:15:40,937
deputy commissioner Podolski.

396
00:15:40,938 --> 00:15:43,708
He's asking for you.
Very angry.

397
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,511
Elderly, sexy, furious.

398
00:15:47,545 --> 00:15:50,847
Well, my career
is over.

399
00:15:50,848 --> 00:15:53,447
See you at the bottom,
Hitchcock. No offense.

400
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:56,546
No, none taken.

401
00:15:58,013 --> 00:15:59,280
Deputy commissioner.

402
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:00,380
Where's my son?

403
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:02,049
He is at my desk,

404
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,554
enjoying a nice glass
of bubbly water

405
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:06,791
and some chocolate I was saving
for a special occasion.

406
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,462
Hey, Peralta,
when you're done,

407
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:10,633
can you help me wrap up
this massive cocaine bust

408
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,235
I just pulled off?
Thanks.

409
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:15,804
Oh, deputy commissioner,
didn't see you there.

410
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:17,405
Sorry for interrupting.

411
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:19,073
Amy Santiago.

412
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:22,811
Trevor, what'd you do
this time?

413
00:16:22,812 --> 00:16:24,046
Nothing.

414
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,282
There you have it.
He said he did nothing.

415
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,917
So I caught him red-handed
doing nothing?

416
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:29,917
I'm saying maybe
it's a possibility

417
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,383
you made a mistake.

418
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:32,851
You know, normally,
I would agree with you,

419
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:34,754
but I've been
pretty detail-oriented

420
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:35,856
the last few hours.

421
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:37,393
You might not
understand this,

422
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,831
but Trevor is
a special kid.

423
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,565
He makes straight "A's.
He's going to Duke next year.

424
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,667
Lacrosse scholarship.
Oh.

425
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:47,438
Sometimes, boys
just need to be boys.

426
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,544
You do realize
he did thousands of dollars

427
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:52,579
worth of property damage,
though,

428
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,214
to police vehicles.

429
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:56,182
Look, I think
we can all agree

430
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:58,285
that I'm ordering you
to let this slide

431
00:16:58,286 --> 00:16:59,922
because nothing happened.

432
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:01,926
This is officially
out of your hands.

433
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:05,366
Would you actually mind
just checking out my report?

434
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,567
It's pretty thorough,

435
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,068
and I spent over an hour
on fonts.

436
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,235
Kinda snazzy, so...

437
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:12,035
Oh, thank you.

438
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:13,202
I'll get right to it.

439
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:15,371
Thanks.
Trevor, let's go.

440
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:18,074
Have a good one.

441
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:27,519
Choo.

442
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,620
Yes.

443
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:30,255
What's up with the chair?

444
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:33,724
Um, Carlene predicted
if I get out of this chair,

445
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:36,060
I'd get badly hurt,
so I'm not chancing it.

446
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:39,996
Oh, man.
There's no pudding cups left.

447
00:17:39,997 --> 00:17:42,198
Ah!
What'd you do that for?

448
00:17:42,232 --> 00:17:45,566
There.
Now you're hurt in this chair.

449
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,034
You can get hurt anywhere,
Boyle.

450
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:48,870
And if you do,
it won't be

451
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:52,809
because some shoe salesman
predicted it.

452
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:55,849
You make
your own destiny.

453
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:03,220
Well, we don't have to worry
about Podolski's son anymore.

454
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:05,122
The case is officially
out of my hands.

455
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:06,289
No charges filed.

456
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,893
Why is there yogurt
on this?

457
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:09,628
The deputy commissioner
threw my report

458
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,363
in Terry's trash can,

459
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:13,029
and he'd been eating
yogurt earlier.

460
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:15,997
Terry loves yogurt.

461
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:18,400
Something wrong?
Kinda, yeah.

462
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:20,137
I called six precincts
about this kid.

463
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:21,940
He's been brought in
a dozen times.

464
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:23,977
Theft, vandalism,
drunken disorderly,

465
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,411
but he's never
been processed.

466
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:28,244
His daddy comes in
and bails him out every time.

467
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,611
He's a lucky little jerk.

468
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:31,244
No, I wouldn't say
he was lucky.

469
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:32,812
I feel bad for this kid.

470
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:34,780
I mean,
what kind of father

471
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,148
cares so little
for his son

472
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,453
that he lets him get away
with everything?

473
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,421
Well, he's someone else's
problem now.

474
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:45,223
Like you said,
it's out of your hands.

475
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,224
All right, I see
what you're trying to do,

476
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,889
but it's not gonna work.

477
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,725
I'm not going to arrest him.
I'm going to arrest him!

478
00:18:49,726 --> 00:18:52,095
- You want backup?
- Yes.

479
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:59,488
What is this?
You can't do this.

480
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:00,956
Get that thing
outta here.

481
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,324
Excuse me, sir.

482
00:19:02,325 --> 00:19:04,360
Trevor Podolski,
you're under arrest

483
00:19:04,361 --> 00:19:06,096
for vandalism
and destruction of property.

484
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:07,531
What... dad!
What are you doing?

485
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:08,734
I told you
to back off, Peralta.

486
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:10,906
First off,
the name's Santiago,

487
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:12,943
Detective Amy Santiago.

488
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,844
Second, I'm arresting
your son,

489
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:19,446
which, as I say it aloud,
seems like an unwise choice,

490
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,282
but it's the one
I'm making.

491
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:23,485
Once again,
my name is Amy Santiago.

492
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,757
You're being stupid, Peralta.
Don't be stupid.

493
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,593
I can make
your life miserable.

494
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:30,364
Commissioner, please don't talk
to my Detective in that Tone.

495
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:31,931
If you have a complaint,
you can take it up with me.

496
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:35,566
You just made yourself
a very powerful enemy, Holt.

497
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,301
I'm gonna be watching you,
both of you, like a hawk.

498
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,402
You're gonna have to try
a little harder

499
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:40,938
if you wanna scare me.

500
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,240
I've been an openly gay cop
since 1987,

501
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:46,309
so you're not the first
superior officer to threaten me.

502
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,144
You know
how I'm still standing here?

503
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,046
'Cause I do my job,

504
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:52,650
and I do it right.

505
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,053
Damn, son!

506
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:56,021
Don't say "son."
Sorry.

507
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:57,756
Deputy commissioner,
if you wanna pick Trevor up,

508
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,625
he'll be
at the nine-nine.

509
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,990
Let's go, fartman.

510
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:06,427
Carlene was wrong, Gina.

511
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:09,131
Rosa said it herself...
I'm in charge of my own destiny.

512
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:10,801
That means she wants me
to make a move.

513
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,971
Mm, but Carlene
was also right.

514
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:15,407
You did get hurt
'cause Rosa punched you.

515
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:17,074
And the fact that Rosa
punched you

516
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:18,475
means she does not
like you.

517
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,242
No, no, she punched me
to prove Carlene wrong.

518
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:23,243
Move.

519
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:24,611
Oh, wait,
I take it back.

520
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,412
She definitely is
