1
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:02,722
Happy Turkey Day.

2
00:00:02,848 --> 00:00:04,433
Yes! Right out of the gate.

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:06,018
What? What's going on?

4
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:07,728
We're playing Boyle Bingo,

5
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:07,728
Thanksgiving edition.

6
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:09,146
Everyone filled out their cards

7
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:11,106
with possible

8
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:11,106
Charles-related scenarios.

9
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:12,567
First to bingo gets 100 bucks.

10
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:14,318
I had "Boyle calls it

11
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:14,318
'Turkey Day'"

12
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:15,986
in the center square.

13
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:18,406
"Boyle explains

14
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:18,406
they ate lobsters

15
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:19,699
at the first Thanksgiving."

16
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:21,033
They did. Back in that time,

17
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:22,493
they called lobsters

18
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:22,493
"ocean bugs."

19
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:23,785
I'll just mark it off for you.

20
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,246
I think got the winning

21
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,246
card here.

22
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:26,872
Boyle tells us

23
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:26,872
that he played Pocahontas

24
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:27,956
in his third-grade play.

25
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:29,291
All the girls were too big.

26
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:30,668
This is a fun one...

27
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,127
"Boyle says, 'gobble,

28
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,127
gobble, gobble.'"

29
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:34,171
Now that I know

30
00:00:32,253 --> 00:00:34,171
you want me to say that,

31
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:36,131
I'll just say it

32
00:00:34,296 --> 00:00:36,131
with two gobbles.

33
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:37,341
Gobble, gobble...

34
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:41,011
Gobble. God, it just

35
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:41,011
sounds right that way.

36
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:42,680
Ugh. I don't like this game.

37
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:44,640
Ha! "Boyle objects

38
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:44,640
to Boyle Bingo."

39
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:46,267
Come on, guys.

40
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:48,227
Boyle says, "Come on, guys."

41
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:48,227
That's two for Terry.

42
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:50,605
Well, guess what.

43
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:50,605
I can spoil your little game

44
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,774
by sitting over here quietly

45
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,774
all day and doing nothing.

46
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,693
Oh! Aah!

47
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:57,570
Anybody have

48
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:57,570
"Boyle falls on the floor"?

49
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:58,862
No one?

50
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,114
That's a victory.

51
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,074
That's a victory for Boyle.

52
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,074
Boom!

53
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:03,492
[all] Boyle says, "Boom!"

54
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:05,786
[upbeat music]

55
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,306
[Jake] Check it out,

56
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,306
chair jockeys.

57
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:28,225
While you were busy tickling

58
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:28,225
the ivories on your computers,

59
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,853
I was doing a bust. Cocaine!

60
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,107
Thanks, Lucius.

61
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,107
He ran, I pursued.

62
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,693
Whole thing turned

63
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,693
into an awesome car chase.

64
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,112
Aah.

65
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:41,614
NYPD!

66
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,198
[grunts]

67
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:45,909
[tires screeching]

68
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:48,370
- Come on! Move, move!

69
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:48,370
- [horn honking]

70
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:51,540
Hey, there, criminal.

71
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:51,540
It's me, Johnny law.

72
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,958
Well, at least

73
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,958
you're done early,

74
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,502
so you have time

75
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,502
to go home and change

76
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:55,961
for my Thanksgiving dinner.

77
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:57,713
Why do we have to dress up

78
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:57,713
for Thanksgiving?

79
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,799
I don't even celebrate

80
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,799
that stuff.

81
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:01,592
The whole holiday

82
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:01,592
is based on overeating.

83
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,636
We should be wearing

84
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,636
velvet track suits and diapers.

85
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:05,179
Jacket and tie.

86
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,097
Rosa's even wearing

87
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,097
her formal leather jacket.

88
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:08,641
It's the one without any blood

89
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:08,641
on it.

90
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,518
You're gonna dress up,

91
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:12,269
and you're gonna give a toast

92
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:12,269
about what you're thankful for.

93
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:13,604
Start preparing.

94
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,648
Oh, I prefer not

95
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,648
to prepare for my toasts.

96
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:17,191
I just wing 'em like scat jazz.

97
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:19,777
[imitates jazz]

98
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:21,779
- Are we singing?

99
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:21,779
- No, no, no.

100
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:26,575
- [singing opera]

101
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:26,575
- [Jake] That's nice.

102
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,536
- You don't have to...

103
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,536
- [continues singing]

104
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:31,372
[whispering] I'm not dressing up

105
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:31,372
for your party.

106
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:33,374
[continues singing]

107
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,543
Damn it, Boyle.

108
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,543
You left the fridge open.

109
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,961
The door couldn't shut

110
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,961
because of your empty pizza box.

111
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:39,714
Pizza? Please.

112
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,590
This is a butternut squash

113
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,590
and truffle butter flatbread.

114
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:44,677
Everything's spoiled.

115
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:44,677
My lunch is ruined...

116
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:49,807
My chicken, my potatoes,

117
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:49,807
my pasta, my meatballs,

118
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:52,560
ham, my yogurt.

119
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:54,645
- Oh, that's a lot of yogurt.

120
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:54,645
- I love yogurt.

121
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,231
So this is your lunch

122
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,231
for, like, the month?

123
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:00,568
I need to eat 10,000 calories

124
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:00,568
a day to maintain muscle mass.

125
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:01,861
My wife made me all of this

126
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:03,445
before she left town

127
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:03,445
with the kids.

128
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:05,865
That was everything

129
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:05,865
in my fridge.

130
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,324
Scully.

131
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:08,743
- Hey, Sarge.

132
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:08,743
- I know you got a secret stash

133
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,118
- of food hidden somewhere.

134
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,118
- Oh, no.

135
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:11,495
Where is it?

136
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,872
- No, I don't.

137
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,872
- Is it in your pockets?

138
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:14,248
Oh, come on.

139
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,624
I'm gonna shake it

140
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,624
out of your pockets.

141
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,251
- Turn around.

142
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,251
- Sarge. [grunts]

143
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,045
- Sarge!

144
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,045
- Go limp, Scully.

145
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,299
- [grunts] This is fun.

146
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,299
- Release your sweets.

147
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:29,513
Can I help you, Santiago?

148
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,474
Oh, Captain, I didn't expect

149
00:03:29,638 --> 00:03:32,474
to see you there.

150
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,101
In my office?

151
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:35,977
So I just wanted

152
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:35,977
to make sure you knew

153
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,312
about the Thanksgiving dinner

154
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:38,856
I'm hosting for the squad

155
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:38,856
after work.

156
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,190
Yes, I received

157
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,777
your "Save the Date"

158
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,777
decorative gourd,

159
00:03:42,902 --> 00:03:45,654
your ornamental cornucopia,

160
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,531
and this beautiful

161
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,531
handcrafted card

162
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:49,074
of a turkey wearing a top hat.

163
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,618
It's a pilgrim's hat.

164
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:52,244
Where's the buckle, Santiago?

165
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,621
The buckle.

166
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:55,748
My husband's

167
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:55,748
out of town for work,

168
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:57,917
so of course I will attend

169
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:57,917
your dinner.

170
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,461
Cool. Whatever.

171
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:03,672
Yeah, don't worry about it,

172
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:03,672
either way. It's not a big deal.

173
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,802
- Yes!

174
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,802
- Why so excited?

175
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:10,304
Did you make the cover of

176
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:10,304
Hair Pulled Back magazine?

177
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:12,973
The captain is coming

178
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:12,973
to my party.

179
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:14,683
I'm gonna give a toast,

180
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,102
tell him how thankful I am

181
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,102
to have him in the precinct,

182
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:19,062
and officially ask

183
00:04:17,227 --> 00:04:19,062
him to be mentor.

184
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:20,815
Wait, are you only

185
00:04:19,187 --> 00:04:20,815
hosting dinner

186
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,775
because you want

187
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,775
to suck up to Holt?

188
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,027
Not cool. This was supposed

189
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,027
to be about friendship.

190
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:28,614
You said you were only coming

191
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:28,614
to see if my apartment

192
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:30,198
was the reason I was single

193
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:32,033
or if it was my personality,

194
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:32,033
like you suspected.

195
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,619
Yeah, but that was before I knew

196
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,287
I could get up

197
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,287
on this high horse.

198
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:37,122
Love the view up here.

199
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,000
Clip clop, clip clop, clip clop.

200
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:42,962
Same to you, your honor.

201
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:45,506
- What judge were you talking to?

202
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:45,506
- That was my mother.

203
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:47,048
You call your mom "your honor"?

204
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:48,884
She's a federal judge

205
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:48,884
in the ninth circuit.

206
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,136
- What else would I call her?

207
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,136
- Okay.

208
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:53,889
Captain, paperwork is all done

209
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:53,889
on that drug bust.

210
00:04:54,014 --> 00:04:55,140
What else you got for me?

211
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:56,976
Nothing.

212
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:56,976
All open cases are assigned.

213
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,603
There's got to be something

214
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,603
I can investigate.

215
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:00,980
No, there's nothing.

216
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:02,523
When there's nothing,

217
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:02,523
there's nothing.

218
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,900
What can ya...

219
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,900
Whoa! Who did that?

220
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:06,360
Don't worry, sir.

221
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:07,903
I will stay here all night

222
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:07,903
figuring this out.

223
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:09,571
I know what

224
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:09,571
you're up to here, Peralta.

225
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,281
Damn straight,

226
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:11,281
I'm trying to catch

227
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:12,992
the mad paper scatterer.

228
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:15,369
You want an excuse to skip

229
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:15,369
Santiago's Thanksgiving dinner

230
00:05:15,494 --> 00:05:16,662
because for some reason,

231
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:17,872
you refuse to celebrate

232
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:17,872
this holiday

233
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:18,914
like a normal person.

234
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,081
Fine. You're right.

235
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:21,792
I wanna do what I do every year,

236
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,044
sit at home, watch football,

237
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,044
and eat mayo nut spoonsies.

238
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,714
Those are spoonfuls of mayo,

239
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,714
sprinkled with peanuts.

240
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,882
That's revolting.

241
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:29,341
Maybe so,

242
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:29,341
but it's what I invented

243
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,010
when I was six

244
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,010
because my mom was working,

245
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,761
so I had to make dinner

246
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:32,761
for myself.

247
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:34,095
My sad story trumps your insult.

248
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:35,848
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

249
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:37,558
[Boyle] Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

250
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:38,684
Thank you, Boyle.

251
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,268
If a case opens up, it's yours.

252
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:42,437
But if not,

253
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:42,437
you will be at Santiago's

254
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:44,982
as a professional courtesy.

255
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:44,982
Dismissed.

256
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:47,442
From what?

257
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:47,442
I thought we were just chatting.

258
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:50,946
We never chat anymore!

259
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,241
Oh, my god, Amy, that's so cool

260
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,993
that you still live

261
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,993
with your grandmother.

262
00:05:56,117 --> 00:06:00,455
I live alone. This is my stuff.

263
00:05:56,117 --> 00:06:00,455
I like quilts.

264
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:02,583
Stop. Each sentence

265
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:02,583
is getting sadder.

266
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,668
It looks like you live

267
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,668
on the set of Murder, She Wrote.

268
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:07,713
Well, I gotta say, it's not

269
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:07,713
as bad as I thought it would be.

270
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,088
The football game's not on,

271
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,549
so I can still watch it

272
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,549
later at home.

273
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,342
And it's kind of cool

274
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,342
to visit a time

275
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,969
before electricity was invented.

276
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:15,429
I have to practice my toast.

277
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,514
- God, how long is that?

278
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,514
- Eight pages.

279
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,098
- Single-spaced?

280
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,098
- Double-sided.

281
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:20,517
- Santiago style.

282
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:20,517
- Mm-hmm.

283
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:22,895
Hey, excuse me.

284
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:22,895
Can we please eat?

285
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,272
My body is starting

286
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,272
to digest itself.

287
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,148
Terry needs nutrients.

288
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:29,735
No eating until the captain

289
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:29,735
gets here, okay?

290
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,445
- Sorry.

291
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,445
- Don't apologize.

292
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,572
I'd rather spend Thanksgiving

293
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,572
at your house

294
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,365
than with my sister.

295
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,910
"Things you find at the beach."

296
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,910
For s, I had seagull.

297
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,536
Good one, Diana!

298
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,622
- Ice cream break.

299
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:41,622
- [Diana] Yay!

300
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:42,748
Yay.

301
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:44,792
It's so pleasant and boring.

302
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,086
But Holt at your house,

303
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,086
surrounded by these idiots,

304
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,254
guaranteed train wreck.

305
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,254
Thanks for the invite.

306
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,297
[doorbell chimes]

307
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:52,173
He's here! Okay, he's here.

308
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,760
Everybody, be cool. Hitchcock,

309
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,760
why do you have your shirt off?

310
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:57,512
Can't spill food on your shirt

311
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:57,512
if you're not wearing one.

312
00:06:57,638 --> 00:06:58,931
What...

313
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:02,225
- Captain Holt.

314
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:02,225
- Happy Thanksgiving.

315
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,185
Your apartment

316
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,185
was very easy to locate.

317
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:07,522
Thank you so much.

318
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:07,522
You look beautiful.

319
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:12,736
Weirdest conversation ever.

320
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:12,736
Nice work, you two.

321
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:15,906
Before we eat,

322
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:15,906
I'd like everyone to go around

323
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,366
and say what

324
00:07:16,031 --> 00:07:18,366
they're thankful for this year.

325
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:20,243
[sighs] Fine, I'll go first.

326
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:23,705
I am thankful that Thanksgiving

327
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:23,705
only comes once a year.

328
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:26,041
People stuff themselves,

329
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:26,041
and then at midnight,

330
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,336
they run to appliance stores

331
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,336
and trample each other to death.

332
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,339
It's a garbage holiday.

333
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,339
[sniffles]

334
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:33,799
I'm sorry, I just get emotional

335
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,718
when I talk about how bogus

336
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:36,718
Thanksgiving is.

337
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:38,137
I'll just go.

338
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,972
I actually prepared

339
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,972
a little something.

340
00:07:40,097 --> 00:07:41,389
You did?

341
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:42,724
When I was a little girl,

342
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:42,724
playing cops and...

343
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,893
- [cell phone ringing]

344
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,893
- Excuse me.

345
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,854
- Continue, Santiago.

346
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,854
- I could wait.

347
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,856
No waiting, just toasting.

348
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,856
I want you to toast.

349
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,649
Now I want to eat toast.

350
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,649
Give me some toast!

351
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,067
[Holt] Okay,

352
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,067
I'll be right there.

353
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:53,443
I have to head back

354
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:53,443
to the precinct.

355
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:54,945
No. Why?

356
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,822
Someone stole $10,000

357
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,822
from the evidence lockup.

358
00:07:56,947 --> 00:07:58,323
Yes! Oh, awesome.

359
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:00,117
- Why is that awesome?

360
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:00,117
- It's a case.

361
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:02,243
You said I could hop

362
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:02,243
on any case that came up.

363
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:03,912
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.

364
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:07,124
Have fun, you guys. Let's roll!

365
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,337
You'd think money would be safe

366
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,337
in a police station.

367
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:13,881
I hear that.

368
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,716
Remember when Santiago

369
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,716
called you "beautiful"?

370
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:17,258
Yes, that was odd.

371
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,260
We need to get this money back,

372
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,260
the exact bills,

373
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:22,014
or the commissioner's office

374
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:22,014
will make our lives hell.

375
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,598
What is this?

376
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,266
Uh, this is Terry dancing.

377
00:08:23,724 --> 00:08:25,266
People do weird stuff

378
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:26,560
in the evidence lockup

379
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:28,187
when they think

380
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:28,187
no one's watching.

381
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,689
Fast forward, fast forward,

382
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,689
fast forward.

383
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,358
Wait, stop.

384
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,358
Okay, so here's our money.

385
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:35,861
Fast forward.

386
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:38,446
[Jake] Hold it,

387
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:38,446
hold it, go back.

388
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:41,158
There's our guy. Got him.

389
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:42,910
We should start

390
00:08:41,282 --> 00:08:42,910
by checking all the perps

391
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,578
that were released

392
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,578
from holding today.

393
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:46,538
- Good idea.

394
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:46,538
- And if's none of them...

395
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:49,374
we may miss Santiago's

396
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:49,374
altogether.

397
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:50,792
Thanksgiving is dead!

398
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:54,671
Santiago, can we please,

399
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:54,671
please just eat?

400
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:56,882
What if Captain Holt and Jake

401
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:56,882
are coming back?

402
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:58,299
Hang on. I have a toast.

403
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,012
I am thankful

404
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,012
to have someone in my life

405
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,514
who gives me a reason

406
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,514
to get out of bed every morning.

407
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,435
And I hope that my relationship

408
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,435
with this person

409
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,022
will only grow more intimate.

410
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:14,274
Who are you talking about?

411
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,444
Um, Hitchcock.

412
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,907
Okay, enough is enough.

413
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,907
I'm eating.

414
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:26,078
[grunts]

415
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,829
What's in these?

416
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,706
Potatoes, butter, a little milk.

417
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,792
And I ran out of salt

418
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,792
so I used baking soda.

419
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:35,170
Why wouldn't you?

420
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:35,170
They're both white powders.

421
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,464
Of course

422
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,464
they're interchangeable.

423
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:38,590
Yeah.

424
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,508
[grunts]

425
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:42,469
There were two men released

426
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:42,469
from holding today

427
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,221
who were the same

428
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,221
size as our thief

429
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:45,639
on the security footage.

430
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:47,141
Even if it is one of them,

431
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:47,141
how will we know?

432
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,101
Easy. The guy on the footage

433
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,101
was left-handed.

434
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:51,561
We just give all of our suspects

435
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:51,561
some made-up form to sign

436
00:09:51,686 --> 00:09:53,272
and see which hand they use.

437
00:09:53,396 --> 00:09:55,023
All right, amigo.

438
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:57,567
Punch it.

439
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:01,947
- [seat belt clicks]

440
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:01,947
- Good. Did that.

441
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:03,364
Now punch it.

442
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,827
Uh-huh. Safety first.

443
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:08,120
Punch it!

444
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:11,290
[electric window whirring]

445
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:13,625
- Now you're just messing with...

446
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:13,625
- [tires squeal]

447
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:17,838
- Anyone want seconds?

448
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:17,838
- Can't. I'm stuffed.

449
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:20,841
[Scully] Amy,

450
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:20,841
the toilet's overflowing.

451
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:23,551
What? Ew! Scully,

452
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:23,551
what did you do?

453
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:25,179
And the night gets worse-better.

454
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:27,181
I didn't do it,

455
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:27,181
although I understand

456
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:28,265
why you'd suspect me.

457
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:29,850
Well then who clogged it?

458
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:38,399
So none of you ate anything?

459
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,277
Terry, you said you ate

460
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:40,277
the whole turkey.

461
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:41,862
Toilet.

462
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:47,159
I ate one string bean.

463
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:47,159
It tasted like fish vomit.

464
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:48,243
That was it for me.

465
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:49,870
But I'm a good cook.

466
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:52,206
You all ate those brownies

467
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:52,206
I brought in last week.

468
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:53,623
I thought they were erasers.

469
00:10:53,748 --> 00:10:55,334
Charles said he loved them.

470
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,669
I'm a textbook people-pleaser.

471
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,669
I have a serious problem.

472
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,672
This was great, though.

473
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,672
You must be so proud.

474
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:03,842
Yeah, Thanksgiving's over.

475
00:11:00,797 --> 00:11:03,842
Everybody go home. We're just...

476
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,302
We're done hanging out together.

477
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,387
I'm not done hanging out.

478
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,387
Let's go to the bar.

479
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,472
They serve food there.

480
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,472
That's a great idea.

481
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:12,559
Oh, look at that.

482
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:12,559
"Boyle saves Thanksgiving."

483
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,686
- Does it really say that?

484
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:14,686
- No. But it does say,

485
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:17,438
- "Boyle believes obvious lie."

486
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:17,438
- Dammit.

487
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:19,900
So what's our strategy here?

488
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,027
I'm thinking we could do

489
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,027
the whole thing in character.

490
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:23,904
I'll play detective Bart Barley,

491
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,489
tightly wound,

492
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,489
hates violence against animals.

493
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,700
And you're my partner

494
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,700
Gerald Jimes,

495
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:31,536
a man who solved

496
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:31,536
every crime but one...

497
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:33,080
The murder of his wife.

498
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:35,707
- Peralta, take this seriously.

499
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:35,707
- I am.

500
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,542
As seriously as you're taking

501
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,542
the search

502
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,169
for the man

503
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,169
who killed Jane Jimes.

504
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:42,172
Your only clue:

505
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:42,172
He wore a yellow sweater.

506
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:45,508
Eh? You're considering it.

507
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:45,508
Let's get in there.

508
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:48,427
NYPD! [knocks on door]

509
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:50,680
What's going on?

510
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,099
I'm in the middle

511
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,099
of carving turkey.

512
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:53,808
I'm vegetarian.

513
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:53,808
Eating meat is murder.

514
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,310
I hate violence against animals.

515
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:56,728
Bup, bup, bup, bup.

516
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:57,979
We overlooked a release form

517
00:11:58,105 --> 00:11:59,522
we were supposed

518
00:11:58,105 --> 00:11:59,522
to have you sign.

519
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,149
We apologize.

520
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,485
Yeah, he's right-handed.

521
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,485
Let's go.

522
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:07,822
[Jake singing] Look out,

523
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:07,822
bad guys, it's Barley and Jimes.

524
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:10,284
Barley and Jimes are

525
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:10,284
on the case.

526
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,827
Please refrain from make-believe

527
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,827
this time.

528
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,372
- Fine.

529
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,372
- [knocks on door]

530
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:17,291
Good evening, ma'am. NYPD.

531
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,000
Barley and Jimes.

532
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:22,337
- We're looking for Donny Romano.

533
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:22,337
- Ugh. Come in.

534
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:24,131
Donny, what'd you do?

535
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:25,173
Cops are here.

536
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:28,593
Aw. What do you guys want?

537
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:30,469
Sorry to bother you, sir,

538
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:30,469
my partner here forgot

539
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:31,846
about a form we need you

540
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:31,846
to sign.

541
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,514
What's happening, Donny?

542
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,514
What'd you do?

543
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,976
I didn't do anything.

544
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,976
It's not my fault.

545
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,769
Same old story.

546
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,769
It's never you, is it?

547
00:12:37,894 --> 00:12:39,229
What did Donny do?

548
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:40,605
I swear, Ma,

549
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:40,605
I don't know what this is about.

550
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,190
Why won't you ever believe me?

551
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:44,525
'Cause I raised a liar. You lie.

552
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:45,652
Shut up, Ma.

553
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:47,237
Hey, don't talk to Ma like that.

554
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:49,030
Don't you tell me

555
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:49,030
what to do, Louie!

556
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:50,198
Excuse me.

557
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:51,283
Hey! Not the rolls!

558
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:52,617
George, do something.

559
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:54,244
Excuse me. If...

560
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,997
[overlapping arguing]

561
00:12:57,122 --> 00:12:58,623
Get off now.

562
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:01,376
My wife was murdered by a man

563
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:01,376
in a yellow sweater!

564
00:13:02,336 --> 00:13:04,545
It's the one case I can't solve.

565
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:10,135
Don't fight with family.

566
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:10,135
It can all go away so quickly.

567
00:13:10,844 --> 00:13:12,304
Sign this?

568
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:20,979
That's a hell of a breakthrough,

569
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:20,979
Jimes. I'm proud of you.

570
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:25,275
- Also, we just caught our man.

571
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:25,275
- He signed with his right hand.

572
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,652
That's right, he did.

573
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,652
But he didn't do it.

574
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:29,946
- He did.

575
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:29,946
- What?

576
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,990
I noticed you throwing

577
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:31,990
those rolls with your left hand.

578
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,658
Not to mention

579
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,658
this hoodie matches

580
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,076
our security footage exactly.

581
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,829
You stole money when you came

582
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,829
to pick up your brother

583
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,831
- from holding today, didn't you?

584
00:13:37,954 --> 00:13:39,831
- Dammit.

585
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:42,250
Nice work, Peralta.

586
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:42,250
So where's the money now?

587
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:43,793
It's not here.

588
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:45,170
I bet it on the football game.

589
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:45,170
My bookie has it.

590
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:47,047
Yes! The case continues.

591
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:50,258
- This is not good.

592
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:50,258
- Right. Sorry, Jimes.

593
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:53,053
His father was murdered

594
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:53,053
by a bookie.

595
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,055
I know you miss him.

596
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,437
Our perp says

597
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,437
the bookie operates

598
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,189
out of a hidden back room.

599
00:14:04,314 --> 00:14:05,564
Try to blend in.

600
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,984
Good idea.

601
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,984
I'll just age myself 60 years,

602
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:09,777
become Chinese and female.

603
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:12,113
Here we go. Whoosh. Did it work?

604
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:14,991
- $10 to play.

605
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:14,991
- Oh, we're just looking around.

606
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,702
- $40 just to look around.

607
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:17,702
- All right, we'll play.

608
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:20,663
- $15 to play.

609
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:20,663
- All right.

610
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,209
[sighs] Tommy,

611
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,209
can we order some food?

612
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,710
The cook's gone.

613
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:25,710
I sent him home.

614
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:26,920
Do you have any more

615
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:26,920
of these pretzels?

616
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:28,796
Sure.

617
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:32,842
I'm gonna call the cook.

618
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,511
Smart. Good call.

619
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:37,389
Hey. Rough night?

620
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:39,682
Yeah, it certainly hasn't gone

621
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:39,682
according to plan.

622
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:42,102
Oh, no.

623
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:44,521
Oh, Amy, I was ordering a drink

624
00:14:42,227 --> 00:14:44,521
called a "rough night."

625
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,773
It's tequila

626
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,773
with a nicotine patch.

627
00:14:46,898 --> 00:14:48,275
Right.

628
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:51,152
How do I get Holt

629
00:14:49,025 --> 00:14:51,152
to pay attention to me?

630
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,321
He sure spends a lot

631
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,321
of time on Peralta.

632
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:56,324
Maybe I should start screwing up

633
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:56,324
like Jake does.

634
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,826
- I can act out, too, you know?

635
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,826
- Please do.

636
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:01,621
Okay. Watch this.

637
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,418
[glass shattering]

638
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:08,086
Oops.

639
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,505
Out, all of you.

640
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,049
- But the cook is coming back.

641
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,049
- Out!

642
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:16,428
Fine!

643
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,846
But I'm taking these olives.

644
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:24,060
[sighs] Sorry. Happy Turkey Day.

645
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,189
[speaking Chinese]

646
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:29,690
Ah.

647
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,234
I think I'm getting

648
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,234
the hang of this.

649
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:34,321
These tiles are

650
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:34,321
either game pieces or candy.

651
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,030
Game pieces.

652
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,491
Here we go.

653
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:39,618
[women speaking

654
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:39,618
Chinese excitedly]

655
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:42,162
I think I just won.

656
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,581
The guy by the bathroom

657
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:44,581
seems very interested

658
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:45,665
in the commotion you just made.

659
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,916
Yeah, and he's been waiting

660
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,543
for the toilet

661
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,543
since we got here.

662
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:50,420
10:1 that's not a bathroom

663
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:50,420
and he's a lookout.

664
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,880
- Let's go.

665
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,880
- You got it.

666
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:54,966
Ahh, I'm gonna just cash out.

667
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:56,884
[speaking Chinese]

668
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:00,888
There is nothing here.

669
00:16:01,014 --> 00:16:02,849
Don't worry, guys. I found food.

670
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,226
Are you eating packing peanuts?

671
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,729
Okay, I do keep a secret stash

672
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,729
of food in the office.

673
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:10,565
I knew it! Where?

674
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:12,275
Where?

675
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:15,362
- Sarge, am I too heavy?

676
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:15,362
- No. Where is it?

677
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,197
There, the one

678
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:17,197
with the water stain.

679
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,367
- There's a lot of food up there?

680
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,367
- Yeah, it's a smorgasbord.

681
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,579
[all screaming]

682
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,085
- I think the rats got to it.

683
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,085
- You think?

684
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:33,046
This is the greatest thing

685
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:33,046
that's ever happened.

686
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:36,299
Okay, it's over.

687
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:36,299
Thanksgiving time of death, now.

688
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:39,093
No, this will not be

689
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:39,093
our Thanksgiving.

690
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,638
All right, you all wait here.

691
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:41,638
Give me an hour.

692
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,139
Terry, to the door.

693
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:44,849
I'm just gonna put

694
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:44,849
you down, man.

695
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:46,976
Yeah, totally. That makes sense.

696
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,436
Hey, there. Bathroom?

697
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:49,854
There's another one upstairs,

698
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:49,854
over there.

699
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:52,857
Aah. Oh! [grunts]

700
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:57,654
[whispering] Oh. Never mind.

701
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:57,654
Let's go.

702
00:16:57,778 --> 00:16:59,406
What, it's really a bathroom?

703
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,824
No, no, there's tons of illegal

704
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,824
stuff happening in there.

705
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:03,410
But they're watching

706
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:03,410
the football game

707
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:05,370
and I DVRed it.

708
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:05,370
I don't wanna see the score.

709
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:06,829
What?

710
00:17:06,954 --> 00:17:08,456
Okay, fine.

711
00:17:06,954 --> 00:17:08,456
We'll go get the stolen money.

712
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:09,874
NYPD! Freeze!

713
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,459
Change the channel

714
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,459
and then freeze!

715
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:13,002
Put it down!

716
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:16,130
[Holt] Put it down!

717
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,091
This is a weird request,

718
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:18,091
will you switch places with me?

719
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,634
I really don't want

720
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,634
to see the score.

721
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:21,177
[both grunting]

722
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:27,767
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

723
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:27,767
That's so much better.

724
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:30,562
Oh! Why are there

725
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:30,562
so many TVs in here?

726
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,106
[Jake] Thank you.

727
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:34,190
The money was still

728
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:34,190
in the bookie's safe.

729
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:35,525
All the numbers match.

730
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,901
Let's head back

731
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,901
to Santiago's party.

732
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:38,653
Ah, no, thanks.

733
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:40,780
I think I'm gonna head home

734
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:40,780
and watch the football game,

735
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:42,365
which was ruined for me!

736
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,367
What's your problem

737
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,367
with celebrating Thanksgiving?

738
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:46,745
It's a sucky holiday.

739
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:46,745
It's always sucked.

740
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:48,162
My mom worked. My dad was gone.

741
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:50,540
And I sat at home

742
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:50,540
watching football.

743
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:54,252
Look, Jake, I came

744
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:54,252
from a very formal family.

745
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,463
My parents were not

746
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,463
especially affectionate.

747
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:59,299
Really, "your honor" wasn't

748
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:59,299
a big snuggler?

749
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,050
But the beauty of being an adult

750
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:02,761
is that you can

751
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:02,761
make a new family

752
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:04,554
with new traditions.

753
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:05,888
That's nice, Captain,

754
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:07,641
but I don't have

755
00:18:06,013 --> 00:18:07,641
a new family yet,

756
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:10,518
so I guess I'm stuck

757
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:10,518
with my awesome old traditions.

758
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:13,354
Okay. I'll tell the squad

759
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:13,354
you couldn't make it.

760
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,441
Thank you. Before you go,

761
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,441
can I borrow some money?

762
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:17,942
I'm getting

763
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:17,942
some pretty serious vibes

764
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:19,360
from Wendy over there,

765
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,362
and I'd like to take her

766
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,362
someplace special.

767
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:29,203
Hey. What are y'all doing here?

768
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:30,455
Amy broke everything

769
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,332
and got us kicked

770
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,332
out of the bar.

771
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,626
Then we got attacked by rats.

772
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,626
It's the best Thanksgiving ever.

773
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:36,127
Fascinating.

774
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:40,047
Happy Turkey Day.

775
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:40,047
Right through there, gentlemen.

776
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:41,841
Not a lot of places are open,

777
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,761
so this will be a multiethnic,

778
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,761
nontraditional Thanksgiving.

779
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,095
It's a real culinary challenge.

780
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,555
Give me 15 minutes

781
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,555
and then we feast.

782
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,808
- Make it five.

783
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,808
- You eat with your eyes,

784
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,811
- so the plating alone...

785
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,811
- Five, Boyle!

786
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,859
- Captain?

787
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,859
- Hmm?

788
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,195
I wanna tell you something.

789
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,195
I think you're...

790
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,823
like, when

791
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,823
I was a little girl...

792
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:06,991
You think I'm like

793
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:06,991
when you were a little girl?

794
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,870
- Forget it. The moment's passed.

795
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:10,870
- Is this about your toast?

796
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,165
- How'd you get that?

797
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,165
- Gina gave it to me.

798
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,042
It's very well-written.

799
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,002
There are several

800
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,002
compelling anecdotes.

801
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,253
The fonts suit the tone.

802
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:20,921
Good work.

803
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:22,465
I do feel, however,

804
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,175
the word choice

805
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,175
could've been improved in spots.

806
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,012
I marked them "awk"

807
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,012
for "awkward."

808
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,853
That was the best thing

809
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,853
anyone's ever said to me.

810
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:37,021
"I marked them 'awk'

811
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:37,021
for 'awkward?'"

812
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:40,024
It's advice. He's mentoring me.

813
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:41,942
Yes!

814
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,195
So this is kind of a play

815
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,030
on your typical

816
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,030
Thanksgiving dinner.

817
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:48,074
For turkey,

818
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:48,074
we have the Peking duck

819
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,701
with a veggie samosa stuffing.

820
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,619
The potatoes are the empanadas

821
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:54,247
with an Ethiopian

822
00:19:51,745 --> 00:19:54,247
lentil stew gravy.

823
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:57,041
And for dessert,

824
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:57,041
some seasonal gelatin cups.

825
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,543
Okay, I ran out of money.

826
00:19:58,668 --> 00:19:59,794
They're from when Hitchcock

827
00:19:58,668 --> 00:19:59,794
had a colonoscopy.

828
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,295
Bon appétit.

829
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:03,798
- I'm here. I'm here.

830
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:03,798
- [all cheer]

831
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:06,050
Finally something

832
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:06,050
to actually be thankful for.

833
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:07,176
What are you wearing?

834
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:08,720
Santiago said to dress up, so...

835
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:11,472
Well, you look beautiful.

836
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:11,472
That's my thing now.

837
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:12,682
I'm just owning it.

838
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:14,475
Okay, before we eat...

839
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:16,143
Nope, not doing that again.

840
00:20:14,601 --> 00:20:16,143
Move.

841
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:17,812
Could you pass the...

842
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:19,606
You get that hand near me again,

843
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:19,606
you're gonna lose it.

844
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,275
- Okeydoke, let's eat.

845
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,275
- Yeah.

846
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,569
Hey, thanks for giving a copy

847
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,569
of my toast to Holt.

848
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:26,404
- That was nice of you.

849
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:26,404
- Oh, you're welcome.

850
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,865
I mean, you don't have to get

851
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,865
so freaked out around him.

852
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:31,117
You're just trying to tell him

853
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:31,117
you respect him.

854
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:32,243
Okay.

855
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:33,453
But to be honest,

856
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:35,288
I kinda gave it

857
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:35,288
to him as a prank,

858
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:37,540
'cause I thought it would be

859
00:20:35,413 --> 00:20:37,540
super embarrassing for you.

860
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:39,709
But I'm happy it worked out.

861
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,545
But I would've been happy

862
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,545
if he hated it.

863
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,255
But I'm happy he didn't.

864
00:20:45,381 --> 00:20:46,507
So you pretty much got

865
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:48,134
the disaster night

866
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:48,134
you hoped for.

867
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,719
Yeah, till you made

868
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,719
the best Thanksgiving meal

869
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:51,095
I've ever had, and ruined it.

870
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:54,641
Excuse me.

871
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:57,518
Uh, so, earlier at Amy's,

872
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:57,518
I didn't give a real toast,

873
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:59,604
because I didn't know

874
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:59,604
what to say.

875
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:03,983
But since that time,

876
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:03,983
a wise, unsmiling man

877
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:07,487
named Gerald Jimes made me

878
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:07,487
realize what I am thankful for.

879
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:09,405
So I'd just like to say

880
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,659
I am happy to be here

881
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,659
with my family...

882
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:16,913
My super-weird family

883
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:16,913
with two black dads

884
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:20,207
and two Latina daughters

885
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:20,207
and two white sons

886
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,752
and Gina and...

887
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:26,172
I don't know what you are,

888
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:26,172
some strange giant baby?

889
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,925
- To the Nine-Nine.

890
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,925
- [all] To the Nine-Nine.

891
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:30,927
That was perfect.

892
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,929
Ooh, "Boyle cries."

893
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:32,929
I got Boyle Bingo!

894
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:34,889
- [all groan]

895
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:34,889
- Yeah!

896
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:36,307
Not a doctor. Shh.
