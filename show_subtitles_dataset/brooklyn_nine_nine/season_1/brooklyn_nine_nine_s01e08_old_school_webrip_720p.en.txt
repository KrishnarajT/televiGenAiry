1
00:00:02,126 --> 00:00:03,130
Careful!

2
00:00:03,131 --> 00:00:05,272
You only get one shot
at this, Peralta.

3
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:06,912
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.

4
00:00:06,913 --> 00:00:09,115
I saw the first 15 minutes
of The Hurt Locker.

5
00:00:09,149 --> 00:00:10,717
Hurry!
The stench is too much.

6
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:12,789
We gotta get
those shoes outta here.

7
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:14,091
How much time
do we have?

8
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:15,994
Scully ate his pot pie
30 minutes ago,

9
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,864
so we probably got 10 minutes
left on this nap.

10
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,768
12 if he's turkey tired.

11
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:22,277
All right, come to papa.

12
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:24,419
It's trapped.
Abort mission.

13
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,629
I have an idea...

14
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:42,462
Let's send these shoes
to hell.

15
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:46,072
Oh, wait.

16
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:47,640
Yeah, just smells
worse than before.

17
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:49,709
Oh...
Ugh! Abort!

18

19
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:14,781
Whoa! Why are you here
before me?

20
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:16,752
Am I asleep?
Is this a dream?

21
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:19,360
I am early because
Jimmy Brogan is here today.

22
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:21,800
Why do you care so much
about some old reporter?

23
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:23,469
Some old reporter?

24
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,472
Is the sky just some
big blue hat

25
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:26,874
that the world wears?

26
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:29,144
No. And no one has ever
thought that.

27
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,548
My point exactly.

28
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,452
Jimmy Brogan
wrote The Squad

29
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:34,654
about badass New York cops
in the '70s.

30
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:36,356
It's the best book
I've ever read,

31
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:38,124
and I've read 15 books.

32
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,828
50 books is not a lot.
Wait...

33
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,732
You said 15?

34
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,573
The Squad
is what made me decide

35
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:46,175
to become a Detective.

36
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:47,810
And it was my first
book report.

37
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:49,478
"The detectives wiped
the mobsters' blood

38
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,851
off their boots
and found the scag."

39
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:55,590
Scag is heroin,
and the book says it's so good,

40
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,662
you can never stop doing it!

41
00:01:57,663 --> 00:01:59,564
See me after class,
Jacob.

42
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:01,766
Fun side note...
I late lost my virginity

43
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,368
to Mrs. Stratton's
daughter.

44
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:05,772
It was... very fast.

45
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:08,378
Nice.

46
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,950
Mr. Brogan, these are
detectives Santiago

47
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:12,219
and Peralta.

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,222
Mr. Brogan, I am a huge fan
of your book.

49
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:16,024
Would you mind
signing my copy?

50
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:18,395
I'd love to.
It's always nice to meet a fan.

51
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:20,433
You can just make it out
to "death wish."

52
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:21,869
That's what everyone
calls me,

53
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,074
'cause I'm always
first through the door.

54
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:25,409
You go through doors normally,

55
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,745
and everyone calls you
pineapples.

56
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:29,114
My grandma calls me
pineapples,

57
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,548
and I regret
telling you that.

58
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,916
Those New York cops
from the '70s you wrote about

59
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:35,983
were my idols... I mean,
Gaminsky, Cavanaugh, Quigg.

60
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,617
Those guys
were the real deal.

61
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:40,452
I once saw Gaminsky
choke a hippy to death

62
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,754
with his own ponytail.

63
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:43,357
Illegal.
Love that.

64
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:44,757
Mr. Brogan
is writing an article

65
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:46,457
about how Brooklyn
detectives have changed

66
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,324
in the 35 years
since The Squad.

67
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,022
He'll be observing
the two of you

68
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,821
on your Internet
identity theft case.

69
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:54,056
I hope Mr. Brogan's presence
doesn't prove to be

70
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:55,758
a distraction to you,
Peralta.

71
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,725
Distracted? Me?
No, sir.

72
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,391
Evil would love that.

73
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:02,225
But I'm not giving evil
the satisfaction.

74
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:04,057
Not today.

75
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,760
Where's the can?
I gotta unload.

76
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,728
"Unload."
Great choice of words.

77
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,795
It'd be an honor
to show you, sir.

78
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:13,397
All right.
Everyone's here.

79
00:03:13,398 --> 00:03:15,799
Today we're gonna work on
our courtroom demeanor.

80
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,398
Pass.
This seminar

81
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,933
is not optional, Diaz.
You're testifying

82
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,934
in an aggravated assault case
tomorrow.

83
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,534
The D.A. is worried

84
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:26,201
about how you present yourself
on the stand.

85
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:28,099
Why?
I'm fine on the stand.

86
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:29,697
Look, I'll make this
real simple

87
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:31,231
so even these dum-dums
can understand.

88
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,733
Man did crime.

89
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,468
I'm sorry... can you
make her stop doing

90
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:37,337
that weird thing
with her face?

91
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:39,071
Crying?

92
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:41,570
And when this is over,
I'm gonna find you,

93
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,037
and I'm gonna break
those little fingers.

94
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,139
Ms. Diaz.

95
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,308
Please stop threatening
the stenographer!

96
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:51,610
This is an important case.
You need to do well.

97
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,310
Fine. I'll take
your dumbass seminar.

98
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:55,477
That's the spirit!

99
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:59,612
Someone has placed
tiny scanners inside ATMs

100
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,378
to steal card numbers
and pins

101
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,445
which they sell
on the Internet.

102
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:05,646
Oh, good God, why do you
smell like an ashtray?

103
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:07,148
Oh, sorry, mom.

104
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,457
It's the only way I can cope
with the stress of the job.

105
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,170
Pffft!

106
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:18,460
Anyway...
We're running an algorithm

107
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,960
to comb through
the transactions

108
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:21,559
looking for a pattern
which will lead us

109
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,492
to the perp's IP address.
Got it.

110
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,292
"Boring mumbo jumbo."

111
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:27,224
Well, you could think
of the algorithm

112
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:28,791
as a boot
and the IP address

113
00:04:28,792 --> 00:04:30,159
as some poor slob's skull.

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,294
You know?

115
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:32,594
We used to call guys

116
00:04:32,595 --> 00:04:34,630
who bragged about
sitting around all day

117
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,765
hair bags.

118
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:38,971
Except for
Detective Finaldi.

119
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:41,238
No, he had to sit
around all day.

120
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,403
A mafia thug pried
both his kneecaps off

121
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:44,803
with a crowbar.

122
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:46,371
Gah... so lucky.

123
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:48,207
This kind of data-driven
police work

124
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,144
has reduced crime
by over 70%.

125
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,581
I know hair bag work
when I see it.

126
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:57,049
Do me a favor... wake me
when your shift is over.

127
00:04:58,684 --> 00:04:59,718
No way.

128
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:04,825
That is amazing!

129
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:06,829
All you need
is for a jury to like you.

130
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:09,299
If they like you, they'll trust you.
Fine.

131
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,967
How do I get these morons
to like me?

132
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:14,937
Don't call them morons.

133
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,637
Good instinct!
Okay.

134
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:19,470
Sit up straight, all right?
Be aware of your hands, okay?

135
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:20,838
And don't be afraid
to smile.

136
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,340
And if you need to buy time,
you can always just say,

137
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,976
"to be perfectly candid..."

138
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,179
To be perfectly candid...

139
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,547
I like that.

140
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:29,650
And always make
good eye contact.

141
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:31,552
But don't stare at people.
Yeah.

142
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,220
You gotta blink.
But don't blink too much.

143
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:35,288
Or too fast.
I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.

144
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:37,455
Don't blink too fast or too
slow or too much or too little.

145
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,956
I know how to blink.

146
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:41,290
Quick question, sir.

147
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,123
You know how we've been
trading favors back and forth

148
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:44,425
and it's your turn
to give me one?

149
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,828
None of that is true.
Yeah, I know.

150
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,331
Please, can I jump onto
a sweet mob-related homicide?

151
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:50,765
There are no sweet
mob-related homicides

152
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,166
on which to jump.

153
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,364
Boom!
There's one at the seven-three.

154
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:56,530
Maybe I should
roll over there, help out.

155
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:58,666
Brogan can tag along,
maybe write some stuff down.

156
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,003
Why do you idolize that man
and the time he wrote about?

157
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:02,939
Because the '70s
were amazing.

158
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,875
I mean, everyone had
thick, juicy moustaches

159
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:06,907
and all the clothes
were orange and flammable.

160
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,906
The '70s were not
a good time for the city

161
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:10,437
or for the department...

162
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:11,805
Corruption, brutality,
sexism.

163
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,474
Diaz and Santiago never
would have made Detective,

164
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:15,709
and an openly gay man
like me...

165
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,977
I never would have been
given a command.

166
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,710
There were very few
black detectives.

167
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:21,009
Did I ever tell you what my
first day on the job was like?

168
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,712
Hello. I'm Raymond Holt.

169
00:06:25,747 --> 00:06:28,351
Are you... here
to turn yourself in?

170
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:31,554
Ah, yeah,
that's really messed up.

171
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:33,188
But the guys that Brogan
wrote about...

172
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,091
They were great detectives.
I mean, they were legit.

173
00:06:35,092 --> 00:06:36,426
Some of them were legit.

174
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:39,828
Some of them were just
Brogan's drinking buddies.

175
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,493
Sir, that is
a brilliant idea.

176
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:43,528
It wasn't an idea.
It was a scathing indictment

177
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:44,830
of your personal hero.

178
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:47,133
Eh, six of one.

179
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,669
This is the best!

180
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:50,037
Drinking with Jimmy Brogan.

181
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,739
So tell me more
about Quigg.

182
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,909
Could he really light
a matchstick on his face?

183
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,479
One time during a drug bust,

184
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,048
he had one of his fingers
shot off.

185
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,184
He didn't even flinch.
He just picked it up

186
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,888
and used it to flip off
every puerto rican in the place.

187
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,790
And that's my cue.
It's late.

188
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,192
Are you kidding?

189
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:07,596
The old guard
drank till dawn,

190
00:07:07,597 --> 00:07:08,798
ate some coffee grounds,

191
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,033
then started the whole day
all over again.

192
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:13,266
Pfft!
I eat coffee grounds.

193
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,535
Sure you do, pineapples.

194
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:15,937
How about
another round?

195
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,140
Are you kidding me?

196
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:18,677
I wanna hang with you
till one of us dies.

197
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:19,979
Look, I'm tired
of talking.

198
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,185
Why don't you tell me
some of your stories?

199
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:23,920
Great. 'Cause I got
some stories

200
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:28,460
that'll make Training Day
look like Super Troopers.

201
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,963
Eh, it's not... bartender.

202
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:31,999
Two scotches.

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,137
No, no, he meant two bottles.
What?

204
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:37,603
I mean... yeah!

205
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:39,939
Aaaalll... right!

206
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:44,865
You'll never get me!

207
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
You'll never get me!

208
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:46,967
We already
got you, idiot.

209
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:49,303
Look who's here.

210
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:52,577
How was your night
of old-school drinking, hmm?

211
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,144
Pretty hung over?
Shh!

212
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,579
Turn off
your mouth siren.

213
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,247
Here are the texts
I got from you last night.

214
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:00,614
"Best night ever."

215
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:02,649
"Why scotch burn so good?"

216
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,454
"Whaz his name in Serpico?"

217
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,525
"Who's the friend of yours
with the ping-pong?"

218
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:09,025
And lastly,

219
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,891
a picture of you
on the subway platform

220
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,661
eating Chinese chicken salad
with no shirt on.

221
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:17,401
Well, last night was awesome.

222
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:20,915
We had an epic night of bonding
that I will never forget.

223
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,309
Do it!
I believe in you.

224
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:29,552
Throw it!
I believe in you.

225
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:30,988
Man, I wonder
if Brogan's okay.

226
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:33,391
He's 65 and drank
two bottles of scotch.

227
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:35,159
He might be dead.
He looks fine to me.

228
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:36,194
Morning, kid!

229
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,462
Ooh!
How ya doing?

230
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:39,198
Uh... hey...

231
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:41,300
So good.
I feel great.

232
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,734
And I definitely don't think
it's burning hot in here.

233
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,302
Well, I'm around.

234
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:46,835
Grab me if anything
develops in your case.

235
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,369
You got it.

236
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,370
That hurt so bad.
Let me know when he's gone

237
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:52,303
so I can slide
onto the nice, cool floor.

238
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:53,636
He's gone.
Great.

239
00:08:53,637 --> 00:08:55,303
Mmm...

240
00:08:58,306 --> 00:09:01,907
Oh... my whole body
has dry mouth.

241
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,510
Why are we meeting
in the ladies' room?

242
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,913
It's the perfect place
for our second lesson...

243
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,181
Courthouse wardrobe.

244
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,217
What's wrong
with the way I dress?

245
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,886
You know, some people might
say that all the black leather

246
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,721
kind of makes you looks like
an evil villain.

247
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,223
Not me.

248
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,930
I think you look like
a sexy motorcycle.

249
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,598
Boyle, pull it together.

250
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,733
Yeah.

251
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,569
We need to
soften up your look.

252
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:28,504
My wife and Charles's mom
donated some clothes.

253
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:31,778
Your wife and Boyle's mom
are both blind?

254
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:35,850
I look like arsenio.

255
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:38,252
So it's... perfect?

256
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:41,551
That's actually
my wedding suit.

257
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:42,820
No.

258
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:44,455
Yes.

259
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:45,724
No.
No.

260
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:50,829
That's great.
Perfect!

261
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:52,064
You look beautiful... ly...

262
00:09:52,065 --> 00:09:54,066
Appropriate for court.

263
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,667
Ohh...

264
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:57,834
Scully.

265
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:59,935
Hey, Jake.
You've been alive forever.

266
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,604
How'd you used to cure
hangovers?

267
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,275
Oh, I didn't drink.
I was, however,

268
00:10:04,276 --> 00:10:06,815
extremely into cocaine
for most of 1986.

269
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:08,350
I gotta tell you the truth,
Hitchcock...

270
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:09,984
Can I tell you the truth?
You and me, man.

271
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,553
We're gonna be co-captains.

272
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:13,355
But first I'm taking you
to Japan!

273
00:10:13,356 --> 00:10:15,392
I'm already packed!

274
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:17,429
I had three heart attacks
that year

275
00:10:17,463 --> 00:10:18,530
and declared bankruptcy.

276
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:20,599
Hitchcock turned out
just fine.

277
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:23,200
My grandpa
was an old-school cop.

278
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:26,503
This was his hangover cure...
Raw egg yolks.

279
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:28,136
Aaahhh!

280
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,204
You look like a corpse
we just pulled out of the river.

281
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,741
Wrong. I look like
a cool rock star

282
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:34,377
who oded in his own pool.
Big difference.

283
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:35,946
I told you not to let
Jimmy Brogan

284
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:37,415
distract you
from your work.

285
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,119
So I assume you're not
too hung over to do said work?

286
00:10:40,153 --> 00:10:43,356
Pfft. Nope. It's like
I never even drank.

287
00:10:43,357 --> 00:10:44,490
And that's not
a hangover cure.

288
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:46,722
What, that?
Naw, it's just some...

289
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:48,958
Protein for my guns.

290
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,229
I drink one every morning
before I lift.

291
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:54,198
So...

292
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,800
Gah!

293
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:00,435
Ah ha ha!

294
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,204
So good!

295
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,976
You can barely even tell
it's a chicken embryo.

296
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:06,647
You should drink it all.

297
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:08,149
For your guns.

298
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,720
Yeah.

299
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,259
Agh.

300
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:20,925
Ah, it's just like...

301
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,827
Fitness, right?

302
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:27,298
Oh, why did I do this?

303
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,400
According to your text,
you were having

304
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:30,933
"the beef light
of my loaf."

305
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:33,535
What? No, no. Why did
I use this algorithm?

306
00:11:33,536 --> 00:11:35,672
We're only tracking people
who use the stolen cards.

307
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:37,607
They might not be the same
as the ones who stole them.

308
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,076
Here,
switch seats with me.

309
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:45,886
Oh, wow.
Your butt's really warm.

310
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,022
My butt's normal.
Your butt's the weird one.

311
00:11:48,056 --> 00:11:49,324
Don't be mad.
It's nice.

312
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:51,389
All right, so if we ignore
all these fraudulent purchases

313
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,391
and go back far enough...

314
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:56,095
Here. Someone posted
the stolen card numbers online

315
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:57,695
from this IP address.

316
00:11:57,696 --> 00:11:59,761
Not bad!
You found the pattern.

317
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,095
All right, let's aspirin up
and roll out!

318
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,463
Ah... ohh!

319
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:05,530
Ohh...

320
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,305
I'm glad you could
be here for this.

321
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:13,373
Mike Halbrook.

322
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:14,873
NYPD. Open up.

323
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:16,807
Put your head
through the door.

324
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:17,975
My head?

325
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:20,376
We got a runner!

326
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,910
Stop!
Hands in the air!

327
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:23,277
Oh, wow.

328
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:29,946
Hoo! Yeah!

329
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:32,986
Good job.
I'm never drinking again.

330
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:36,387
Hey. You know,
I was gonna take him out myself,

331
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,654
but ladies first, so...

332
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,089
Relax, kid.

333
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:41,926
Being too hung over
to chase a perp?

334
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,163
That's a classic
old-school move.

335
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:47,302
You know, you are one of
the last few good cops

336
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:49,769
fighting against
the rising tide of hair bags.

337
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:51,904
That's what you're gonna
say in your article?

338
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,204
Ah, don't worry,

339
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,072
you're gonna come out
lookin' real good.

340
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,808
Especially after
our talk in the bar.

341
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,575
Ah...
So many good quotes!

342
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:00,377
Especially about Holt.

343
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,911
Cops are usually afraid

344
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:04,145
to go after their
captains like that,

345
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:08,345
but you, sir,
are old-school.

346
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,249
You know it.

347
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,950
Oh, pineapples...

348
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,017
What did you do?

349
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:17,483
Your witness counselor.

350
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:20,018
Detective Diaz, it's always
a pleasure to see you.

351
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:21,419
This is not good.

352
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,088
The lawyer is that slimeball
grundhaven... Rosa hates him!

353
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:25,724
She's dressed right.
We coached her.

354
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,526
She'll be okay.

355
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:30,365
Would you please state
your name for the record?

356
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,668
To be perfectly candid...

357
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:34,303
My name is
Detective Rosa Diaz.

358
00:13:34,337 --> 00:13:35,638
Well, thank you for
your candor

359
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,374
regarding your own name.

360
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,346
Detective Diaz,

361
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,782
would you please
tell the court

362
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:43,352
exactly how you're
involved in this case?

363
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:45,488
I caught Mr. Ladd
physically beating his boss

364
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,724
with a fax machine.
Most of his cheek

365
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,092
was caved in.

366
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:51,061
His head was basically
a blood fountain.

367
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,363
I'm sorry, is this
amusing to you, Ms. Diaz?

368
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:56,234
Blinking.

369
00:14:00,241 --> 00:14:01,842
Oh, no.

370
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:04,046
Brogan just sent me
the quotes he's gonna run.

371
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:06,081
I slammed Holt
like 50 times.

372
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:07,415
Listen.

373
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,717
"Holt would rather
I wear a tie

374
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:09,885
"than solve a case.

375
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:12,053
"Holt cares more about
catching clerical errors

376
00:14:12,054 --> 00:14:13,988
"than catching bad guys.

377
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:16,757
Holt is way too
verticulis"?

378
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:19,060
That's not even a word!
What were you thinking?

379
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:20,861
We were just hanging out,
being old-school.

380
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,531
He wasn't supposed
to quote me.

381
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:24,735
I was off the record
the whole time.

382
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:26,206
Oh, no wait.

383
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,609
I'm goin' on the record.

384
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:30,615
Jake Peralta...
Can dance!

385
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,918
Whoo!
Whoo!

386
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,390
Jimmy Brogan!

387
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:38,959
You need to fix this,
okay?

388
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,763
Those quotes
cannot run.

389
00:14:40,764 --> 00:14:42,797
It would be
devastating for Holt.

390
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,099
And the department.
I'll fix it.

391
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,235
Brogan's a cool guy.
We're friends now.

392
00:14:47,236 --> 00:14:50,006
I'll just talk to him,
awesome dude to awesome dude.

393
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:52,511
I should brush my teeth
first, though, right?

394
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:53,980
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's terrible.

395
00:14:53,981 --> 00:14:55,514
Ugh!

396
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:56,883
Great advice, dummies.

397
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:58,251
I look like a psycho
up there!

398
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:00,321
Yes. You have to
pull it together.

399
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:03,227
That's not helping!
That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous.

400
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,997
Rosa, I think
you're nervous.

401
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:06,501
Of course I'm nervous!

402
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:07,971
What did you think
was the problem?

403
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:09,139
We just assumed you were
a terrifying human being

404
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,373
with a short fuse.

405
00:15:10,374 --> 00:15:12,808
But if the problem
is that you're nervous,

406
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:15,044
that's where
Charles Boyle lives, baby.

407
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,613
I can help!
You just need to go

408
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:17,982
to your happy place.

409
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,156
What's that?
Sounds stupid.

410
00:15:20,157 --> 00:15:21,791
Oh, everyone's happy place
is different.

411
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,292
For me, I just imagine
I'm slurping up

412
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:25,328
the world's longest
piece of linguini.

413
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:27,665
It just keeps going
and going.

414
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,671
Every 20 feet of noodle,
there's a sauce change.

415
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,841
I'm in my happy place
right now.

416
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:34,541
Mmm... pesto.

417
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,307
Mmm! Carbonara!

418
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:39,911
Great!
Now I'm starving!

419
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:45,987
Hey, hey, Jimmy Brogan.

420
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,023
Thanks for meeting me.

421
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:49,489
Welcome to
the Schvitz, kid.

422
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,260
The most comfortable
place on earth.

423
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:54,264
It's like crawling back
into your mother.

424
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:55,999
Is that something
people wanna do?

425
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,434
What'd you wanna
talk to me about?

426
00:15:57,435 --> 00:16:00,671
So I read those quotes
you sent me,

427
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:03,074
and you...
Wrote them so good.

428
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:04,843
The thing is...

429
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,179
I know I hid it
incredibly well,

430
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,084
but I was pretty drunk
when I said that stuff, so...

431
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:10,519
Any chance
you wouldn't print it?

432
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,719
Well, you said you were
going on the record.

433
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,752
I was clearly
not in control.

434
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:17,584
Well, maybe you should learn
to handle your brown.

435
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,018
Eew.

436
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,585
Look, you know
that I think

437
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:23,788
you're like the number one
hero of the 20th century.

438
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:25,724
But kinda feel like
you're being unfair here.

439
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,691
"Feel like"?
Listen to her,

440
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:30,393
Suzanne Somers over here.
Talk like a man.

441
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:31,928
All right,
I will talk like a man.

442
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:33,865
You got me drunk
and took advantage of me.

443
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,701
Oh, come on.
Gah!

444
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,072
Look, I'm asking you
nicely...

445
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:38,941
Please don't print
the quotes.

446
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:41,249
And I'm telling you nicely,
I'm printing them.

447
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,717
No, you're not.

448
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:45,354
What are you gonna
do about it?

449
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:52,359
Hey, how'd it go with Brogan?
Perfect.

450
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,662
Except I punched him
in the face

451
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,164
and made everything
a billion times worse.

452
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:56,164
What?

453
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:05,314
Yeah.

454
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:06,983
So, Detective Diaz,

455
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,010
you saw my client
struggling with his boss,

456
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:10,945
but you don't know
who initiated the fight.

457
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,113
To be perfectly candid,

458
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,365
I was pretty sure
it was the defendant.

459
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:16,826
Oh, to be perfectly candid,
"pretty sure" is not definitive.

460
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:19,255
I think I know
what happened.

461
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,558
Well,
to be perfectly candid,

462
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,706
no one cares what you think.

463
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,374
Do you actually know
anything,

464
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,566
or are you just guessing?

465
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,835
Your client instigated
the fight.

466
00:17:30,836 --> 00:17:32,305
I'm certain.

467
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:34,010
And I'm happy
to tell you why.

468
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:35,378
Yes!

469
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:36,780
She went to
her happy place.

470
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:38,116
I know that, Boyle.

471
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:40,817
You punched
Jimmy Brogan?

472
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,059
What were you thinking?

473
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,120
I was thinking

474
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,562
that I needed to protect
this precinct.

475
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,958
From things that I said
about this precinct

476
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:49,427
to a reporter while drunk
and insisting he record me.

477
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:50,996
I shouldn't have done it.
Unbelievable.

478
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,766
Every time I think you might
make a decent Detective,

479
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:53,968
you go and pull
something like this.

480
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:57,338
I thought I could
handle my brown.

481
00:17:57,373 --> 00:17:58,972
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's gross.

482
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,370
Go home!

483
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:04,273
You got the rest of the day
to put your head on straight.

484
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:12,069
Got Halbrook to cop
to every charge.

485
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:13,902
Nice work, Santiago.
Thank you, sir.

486
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:15,737
Peralta figured out
the pattern, though,

487
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:17,506
so he should get credit
for the collar.

488
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:18,674
Have you seen him?

489
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,744
I sent him home.
He assaulted Jimmy Brogan.

490
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:23,781
Yeah. But that caveman
kinda had it coming,

491
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,182
don't you think?

492
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:27,688
Oh. He didn't tell you.

493
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,724
Tell me what?
Never mind.

494
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:32,193
If Jake didn't tell you,
he must have had a reason.

495
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:35,026
It's not my place.
I'm disappointed in you, Santiago.

496
00:18:35,061 --> 00:18:37,960
I thought
you and I were close.

497
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:40,162
I know you're
manipulating me...

498
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:41,329
But I love it,

499
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:43,466
and I will tell you
anything.

500
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,034
So Jake went to the Schvitz
to talk to Brogan.

501
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:48,169
What are you gonna
do about it?

502
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,267
There's nothing
I can do...

503
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:57,004
Except to ask you nicely
as a fan of you,

504
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,539
your work, and the guys
you wrote about...

505
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,908
Please don't print
the quotes.

506
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,175
Sheesh. I didn't realize

507
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:03,643
you were gonna get your panties
all in a pretzel!

508
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:05,509
That's actually not
technically possible.

509
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,943
I'm not wearing underwear.

510
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:09,545
It is swampy in here.
My butt's like the everglades.

511
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:12,216
Look, I know you're trying to
be legit in a hair bag world,

512
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,383
so I will not print
your quotes.

513
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,085
Ah, thank you,
thank you!

514
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:17,519
That means
the world to me.

515
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,986
And for the record,

516
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:20,454
I know that Holt
is a stickler,

517
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:21,888
but he's actually
a really good cop.

518
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:24,223
Don't worry about it.
We're friends.

519
00:19:24,224 --> 00:19:27,092
You don't have to stick up
for that homo.

520
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:30,167
I really wish you
hadn't just said that.

521
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:31,196
What, homo?

522
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:32,197
Ooh!

523
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:34,880
Thank you, Santiago.
That'll be all.

524
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:40,399
Here she is.

525
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:43,501
Diaz, you did it.

526
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:45,368
They found him guilty
on all charges.

527
00:19:45,403 --> 00:19:46,936
Huh. Boyle's advice
worked.

528
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,037
So...

529
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,870
Where's your happy place?

530
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:54,339
I'm in a cabin
in the middle of nowhere.

531
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:55,807
Inside it's just me

532
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:58,444
and that stupid,
slimy defense attorney.

533
00:19:58,445 --> 00:20:01,048
And I'm beating
the hell out of him.

534
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,250
I break a dining room table
over his head.

535
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:05,151
Then I rip off his arm

536
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,020
and shove it
where the sun don't shine.

537
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:09,189
Then I reach down
his throat

538
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,461
and shake his hand.

539
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:16,268
Yeah. Okay.

540
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:19,238
I'm gonna go ahead and schedule
you for a psych eval.

541
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,042
I owe you one, Boyle.

542
00:20:22,077 --> 00:20:23,278
Thank-you dinner.
Tomorrow night.

543
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:25,483
Gribaldi's.
It's all-you-can-eat linguini.

544
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,087
Yes!

545
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:29,588
Oh, my boyfriend's
coming too.

546
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,979
Your what friend now?

547
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,128
All right.

548
00:20:35,162 --> 00:20:36,763
Let's hear it.

549
00:20:36,797 --> 00:20:38,834
Well, it's even worse
than I imagined.

550
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,136
"The new face of the NYPD

551
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:43,939
is perfectly embodied by
Brooklyn's own Jake Peralta..."

552
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:45,108
That's not so bad.

553
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:46,878
"Who cowers behind
his desk all day

554
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,846
like the true hair bag
that he is."

555
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,246
There it is.

556
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,281
"The old guard would have
eaten a guy like Peralta

557
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:55,286
for breakfast
and unloaded him by lunch."

558
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,958
Well, it's very colorful.
And hurtful.

559
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:00,860
You can ignore
that garbage, Santiago.

560
00:21:00,894 --> 00:21:03,128
Jimmy Brogan wouldn't
know a legit cop

561
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,732
if he punched him
in the face.

562
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,640
Well...

563
00:21:10,674 --> 00:21:13,641
Guess I'm done
with this.

564
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:16,712
Not good enough.

565
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:19,184
Three, two, one...

566
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:26,125
Welcome to the party, pal!

567
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:28,028
God,
you love that movie.

568
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,711
It's Die Hard.

569
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:33,638
