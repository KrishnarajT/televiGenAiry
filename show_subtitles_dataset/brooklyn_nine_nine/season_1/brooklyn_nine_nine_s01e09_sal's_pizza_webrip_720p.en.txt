1
00:00:01,326 --> 00:00:03,121
Oh, this is amazing.

2
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:04,355
This is so amazing.

3
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:05,356
Everything about this
is amazing.

4
00:00:05,357 --> 00:00:06,357
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:07,625
A virus got on the server

6
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:09,159
and sent all of us an email

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,159
with everyone's
search histories.

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,360
Check this out.

9
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:12,561
Sergeant Jeffords
searched the Internet

10
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,496
for "undiscovered muscle."

11
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,564
I was working out
and saw a muscle in my shoulder

12
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:18,164
I'd never seen before.

13
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:20,432
I thought it might've
been a scientific discovery.

14
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,900
Listen to this.
Scully searched for

15
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:24,669
"how much fudge
is in a calorie?"

16
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:27,337
I never found the answer,
but it was a good question.

17
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:29,172
Boyle looked up,
"how to make desk yogurt."

18
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:32,374
Yes, I did, and I am thrilled
with the results.

19
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,375
Although the jar
is really hot.

20
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,410
That's gross.
And Amy searched for

21
00:00:36,445 --> 00:00:39,212
"Daniel Craig hands"
plus "close up."

22
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,279
Ugh.

23
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:41,547
You should talk.

24
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:43,816
You searched for
"cheapest date possible."

25
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:46,250
And I wear that search
like badge of honor.

26
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:48,485
So, ready for dinner?

27
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:50,874
Here we go.

28
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:52,354
Would you like
something sweet?

29
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,256
Or maybe savory?

30
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:56,291
Apple pie...
And I'm stuck.

31
00:00:56,292 --> 00:00:58,359
I'm stuck!

00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:22,274
Peralta.

34
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:26,243
Hey, Sal.
To what do I owe the honor?

35
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:27,945
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:27,946 --> 00:01:29,947
Yeah, we'll be right there.

37
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:31,881
Boyle...

38
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:36,884
No!

39
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,519
I can't believe Sal's
is gone.

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,253
This place
is an institution.

41
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:41,621
It's the best pizza
in the neighborhood.

42
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:43,956
Well, eighth-best.

43
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:45,423
But yeah, a tragedy.

44
00:01:45,424 --> 00:01:47,692
I mean, any food-related crime
is a tragedy.

45
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:52,294
Oh, no.
Heads up, fire marshal.

46
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:01,845
Oh, Boone.
What's that nimrod doing here?

47
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,479
Hey, Peralta.

48
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:05,013
Hey, Boone.

49
00:02:05,014 --> 00:02:06,647
What are you doing here,
you nimrod?

50
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:07,982
Uh, there was a fire.

51
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:10,083
Big question is,
what are you doing here?

52
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:12,918
What, did somebody call in
a missing doughnut?

53
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,685
Uh, actually
someone reported

54
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:15,953
they couldn't find
your head.

55
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:17,688
But we found it.
It was up your butt.

56
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,046
You're a fireman,
you should know

57
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,723
how to treat that burn.

58
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,424
Joke's on you,
'cause this is a fire,

59
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:24,659
which means it is
fire department jurisdiction.

60
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,026
So why don't you back off

61
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:27,827
and let New York's bravest
handle it?

62
00:02:27,862 --> 00:02:29,529
You know they only
call you that because

63
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,297
"New York's best
at spraying stuff with water"

64
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,298
is too wordy.

65
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:33,432
Ha, well, it's too bad

66
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:34,666
we all can't be as awesome

67
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:36,367
as New York's finest,

68
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:38,301
which by the way,
sounds like my mom

69
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:40,669
describing her dishware,
which... and she's dead,

70
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,504
so let's tread lightly
on the response.

71
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:43,939
- That's not fair.
- Yeah.

72
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,640
Well, look, we heard
this might be arson,

73
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,041
so we wanted
to check it out.

74
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,775
No, I'm not letting you
onto my crime scene.

75
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:51,677
Okay?

76
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:53,612
All right, fine.
You know what?

77
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:55,999
You're not invited
to our next murder.

78
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:59,648
Good solve on
the Herman Avenue burglaries.

79
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:01,316
Finish up the paperwork
as soon as possible.

80
00:03:01,317 --> 00:03:02,750
Your wish is my command.

81
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:04,985
No, that was
actually a command.

82
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:07,320
So my command
is your command.

83
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,422
Well, then I guess you still
have all three of your wishes.

84
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,957
- You're not a genie.
- I know that.

85
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,825
Okay.
We're leaving.

86
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:16,894
What was the name
of the clerk we questioned

87
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:18,105
about the second burglary?

88
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,961
Where do farts go?

89
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:22,029
I was reading
Scully's searches.

90
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,498
Hey,
why'd you do a search

91
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:25,466
for "magic-themed
singles night"?

92
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:27,000
My last four dates
were really boring,

93
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,782
so I thought
I'd mix things up.

94
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,953
Oh, wow.

95
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:36,775
Ta-da!

96
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,509
Oh, no.

97
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,710
What about you?

98
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:40,910
Why were you looking
for real estate

99
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,478
in Ropesburg, New Jersey?

100
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,913
Ropesburg P.D.
Offered me a job

101
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,548
as their new police Captain.

102
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:46,549
I turned it down.

103
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,550
Oh!

104
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,719
You... Captain.

105
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,521
Oh... that's super...

106
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,722
Super cool.

107
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,127
If we're gonna figure out
what happened at Sal's,

108
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:06,662
we've gotta
get past those firemen.

109
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,464
We need access.
How 'bout this?

110
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:10,999
We light a bunch of fires
throughout Brooklyn,

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,701
and when the firemen
go to "fight the fires,"

112
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,969
we walk right into Sal's,
the crime scene's ours.

113
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,403
Why do we want to start a turf
war with the fire department?

114
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,005
I feel very uncomfortable
saying this to you,

115
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,138
but it doesn't seem
like it's worth it...

116
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,773
- Unless you think it is.
- I do.

117
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:24,674
Like I said,
Sal's is an institution,

118
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:26,408
and it's the best pizza
in the neighborhood.

119
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:28,643
I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's
is only the eighth-best.

120
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,713
I put out a weekly Brooklyn
pizza-ranking email blast.

121
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:33,814
Sal's has
the fourth-best texture,

122
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,916
ninth-best crust,
twelfth-best cheese,

123
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,484
and honestly, they're only
seventh in mouth-feel.

124
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,952
"Mouth-feel"?
What is that?

125
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:41,486
The inside of your cheeks
are very sensitive.

126
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:42,620
It's like the inside
of your thighs,

127
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:43,620
except with a tongue.

128
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:44,989
Ugh, God.

129
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,857
Look, no, Sal's
has the secret sauce recipe

130
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:48,904
that puts all the other
pizza places to shame.

131
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:51,659
But more importantly,
fire marshal Boone

132
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:53,861
is incapable of conducting
a crime investigation.

133
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,796
All fire marshals
are doofuses,

134
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:58,665
but Boone is King doofus
of doofus island.

135
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,066
Gasoline?

136
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,541
I'm pretty sure
that's water.

137
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,501
Only one way to tell.

138
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:07,437
There were more ways
to tell.

139
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:10,105
And he's their leader.

140
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:13,641
Captain, here's the mope
who hacked our computer system.

141
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:16,443
His mother turned him in.
His name is Corey Park.

142
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:17,644
My name is Savant.

143
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,813
His web handle is "Savant."

144
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:21,895
His people name
is Corey Park.

145
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:24,115
Why'd you target us with
your computer virus, Corey?

146
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,749
I don't know, I was bored,
and it was easy

147
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,484
to break into
your weak-ass system.

148
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,085
It was like taking candy
from a baby.

149
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:32,687
Why are you giving candy
to a baby in the first place?

150
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:35,856
Don't give candy to a baby!
They can't brush their teeth!

151
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:39,592
Yes, sergeant, it is unwise
to give babies candy.

152
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:40,893
If it's so easy
for this gentlemen

153
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:42,627
to break into our system,
we may need to hire

154
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:43,961
a new I.T. Director.

155
00:05:43,962 --> 00:05:46,003
Why don't you and Gina
get together on that?

156
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,731
I doubt I'll need Gina's help.

157
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:49,865
I'm sure she's busy anyway.

158
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,869
Use Gina.
She's my assistant,

159
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,204
and she has something
to offer.

160
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:58,905
Trust me.

161
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:02,041
Man, don't be hacking
into my stuff.

162
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,688
Uh-oh, Jake, firemen.

163
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,211
What are you two doing here?

164
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:08,078
You're a Detective,
you detect it out.

165
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,112
Good one, bro.

166
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:10,647
- I know, bro.
- Yeah, bro.

167
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,581
Wow, it's like watching
meet the press.

168
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:13,782
Boone reconsidered.

169
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:16,183
He wants you
to take a look at the files.

170
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:18,585
Well, that's unexpected,
but...

171
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,852
All right, fine, I'll...

172
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:21,653
It's not a file, bro.

173
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:23,488
It's a doughnut,
because you're cops.

174
00:06:23,489 --> 00:06:24,455
You sure?

175
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:26,990
All right, I don't care

176
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:28,058
if it's not our jurisdiction,

177
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:29,225
we're solving this.

178
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:30,459
Would you like me
to, uh,

179
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,693
file that for you, Jake?

180
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:32,799
Just ask for the doughnut,
Scully?

181
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:33,828
Can I have the doughnut,
please?

182
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:34,962
Yes.

183
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:36,029
Thanks.

184
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,353
It's good to see you, Sal.

185
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:43,921
I'm so sorry
about the fire.

186
00:06:43,922 --> 00:06:46,455
I can't believe it's gone,
Jakey, all of it.

187
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:47,689
The pizza oven.

188
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,690
The first dollar bill
I ever made.

189
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,325
The 7-up fridge.

190
00:06:51,326 --> 00:06:53,860
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You'll rebuild.

191
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,995
The fire department's
been asking a lot of questions.

192
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,897
Oh, fire department questions.
Let me guess.

193
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:00,398
"Uh, what part of my face
do I put food in?"

194
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,465
"How do you count to one?"

195
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,000
"What's air?"

196
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:05,702
They think I torched
my own place.

197
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:07,035
You know I wouldn't do
something like that, right?

198
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:08,036
Yeah, of course.

199
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:09,036
But can you think of anybody

200
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,337
who might've done it?

201
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:11,571
I could think
of ten pizzerias

202
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:12,872
that want me
out of the game.

203
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:14,440
That jerk Mario
comes to mind.

204
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,408
We share a delivery radius.

205
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,842
Mario is number ten
overall in Brooklyn,

206
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:19,510
and rising fast.

207
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:20,678
He might've wanted
to move up the ladder.

208
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:21,778
Of one foodie weirdo's

209
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,546
personal pizza email blast?

210
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:24,681
Yeah.

211
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:26,415
Okay, we'll start with him,

212
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,683
then we'll move on to the rest
of your competition,

213
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:28,984
see if anything suspicious
turns up.

214
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:30,652
It'll be
the perfect opportunity

215
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:32,086
to update my rankings.

216
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,520
Can we stop at home
for a pizza bib?

217
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,921
No, Charles,
we gotta go fast.

218
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,388
Right, right,
I'll just use my work bib.

219
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,956
No, no bib.

220
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,991
We're gonna solve this
for you, Sal.

221
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,451
Sit tight.

222
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:43,627
The guy who did the safe

223
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:44,961
in the second apartment,
what was his name?

224
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:46,562
Cone.

225
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:49,084
"C" as in "Captain."
"O" as in "overlooked."

226
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:51,086
- What?
- Nothing.

227
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,099
She said "C" as in "Captain,"
"O" as in "over..."

228
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,868
Yeah, I know
how to spell cone.

229
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:56,469
Okay.

230
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,938
So, Ropesburg P.D.

231
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:01,873
- You know someone there?
- Nope.

232
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:03,374
So you were looking
for a new job?

233
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,509
- Nope.
- Weird.

234
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,844
They just offered you Captain
without considering anyone else?

235
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,513
Like Scully...

236
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:12,914
Because he's got
so many years on the force.

237
00:08:12,948 --> 00:08:14,548
Hey, guys,
I think I put my gun

238
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:16,750
in one of these boxes,
and I don't know which.

239
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,852
You have a problem with me
that you want to talk about?

240
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:23,421
Me? No, I am just
filing evidence, sir.

241
00:08:23,422 --> 00:08:26,557
Found my gun.
It was in my holster.

242
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:27,858
My holster's on my butt.

243
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,916
Good solve, Scully.

244
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:32,594
Mario, this pie needs work.

245
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,004
Good consistency
on the crust,

246
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,830
but the cheese-to-sauce ratio
is a travesty.

247
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:39,632
Do you have to spit?

248
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,899
In a word, yes.

249
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,533
Amateurs go tasting,
they fill up,

250
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,067
and they lose their palate
by the third slice.

251
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:45,635
I take this very seriously.

252
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:46,869
So, Mario...

253
00:08:46,904 --> 00:08:48,504
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

254
00:08:48,538 --> 00:08:50,805
Your credit card transactions
are down by 1/3

255
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,140
in the last six months.

256
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,541
Meanwhile, over at Sal's,

257
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,909
it was a bunch of smiling faces

258
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,942
and happy stomachs.

259
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:57,411
One night, you snapped.

260
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,981
A little gasoline... fah!
A little match.

261
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:03,483
And poof! No more Sal's.
How right am I?

262
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,584
The night of the fire,
I was at my father's funeral.

263
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,919
Oh...
My condolences.

264
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:10,053
Ugh.

265
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:11,521
Gino...

266
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:13,823
This pizza is much better
than last time.

267
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,123
You've always
ranked dead last

268
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:17,091
in structural integrity
and sauce.

269
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:20,026
But way more importantly,
I did a little research,

270
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:23,129
and it turns out you did
six months in prison for a b&e.

271
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,964
I did.
The night of the fire,

272
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,966
I was at the prison
giving a motivational speech

273
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,017
on how parolees
can turn their lives around.

274
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,768
Well, it's good to hear
that the system works,

275
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,036
and you are welcome.

276
00:09:33,037 --> 00:09:35,471
Have a good one.

277
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:37,206
This is a dead end.

278
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:38,740
We've gotta check out
that crime scene.

279
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:40,508
Can't.
Firemen locked it down.

280
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:42,109
Grab your spit bucket, Boyle.

281
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,949
Those hose monkeys
can't stop us.

282
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,480
Ah, you must be Simon Walker.

283
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,215
Have a seat.

284
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,217
It says here
you were an I.T. Specialist

285
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:53,918
with the board of ed
for two years.

286
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,127
Well, I know my way around
a computer, that's for sure.

287
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:58,789
Query: What's your
favorite Jay-Z song?

288
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:00,123
I'm sorry?

289
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:01,457
Favorite Jay-Z song?

290
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,925
She's kidding.

291
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,626
Hmm. No, I'm not.
What is it?

292
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:05,762
I don't know.

293
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:08,029
- I'm sorry about her.
- Okay.

294
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,058
What's your experience
with cyber-security?

295
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:12,200
Uh, well, I added
encryption software...

296
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:14,236
But seriously, what's
your favorite Jay-Z song?

297
00:10:14,237 --> 00:10:16,238
I don't know! Big pimpin'?
It's big pimpin'!

298
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:19,440
Mm, wrong answer, friend.

299
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:22,946
And that's, um,
how I got involved in,

300
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:24,643
you know, systems analysis.

301
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:27,211
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.

302
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:29,146
There's no need
to be nervous.

303
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:32,481
Yeah, we're all just calm,
cool, collected...

304
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:34,082
Wahh!

305
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:36,017
Oops.

306
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:38,720
Was that a little sudden?

307
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:41,690
What would you say is your
biggest weakness as an employee?

308
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,860
Um...

309
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:45,844
I'm sorry,
what was the question again?

310
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:48,197
He said, "what's
your biggest weakness

311
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:49,699
As an employee?"

312
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,807
That's just gross.

313
00:10:50,834 --> 00:10:51,833
I'm sorry,
I just have

314
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,234
a skootch of gingivitis.

315
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,703
So I'm trying
to treat that as best I can.

316
00:10:55,737 --> 00:10:56,871
Sorry.
You seem disgusted.

317
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,606
Here's an itemized list

318
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:00,641
of everything taken
from the garden apartment.

319
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,743
TV, computer...

320
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,078
"Ster-b-eo"?

321
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,547
Uh-oh, spelling error.

322
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:07,748
That's not very Captain-y.

323
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,035
Oh, my God, enough.

324
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:12,819
I just think that you meant
"stereo," not "ster-b-eo."

325
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,187
Did you mean "ster-b-eo,"
Captain?

326
00:11:15,188 --> 00:11:17,959
That's it.
Get in my car, now.

327
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,085
And if you say another word,

328
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,560
I promise you,
you will regret it.

329
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,996
Aye aye, cap...
Ow, okay.

330
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:26,885
Fine, I regret it.
Ah... I'll go. I'm going.

331
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,634
These firemen
are not moving.

332
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,035
We gotta distract 'em.

333
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:32,036
Tell 'em
your little boy's cat

334
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:33,270
got stuck up in a tree.

335
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,271
Ooh, undercover work.
I love it.

336
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:36,672
I need more back story.

337
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:38,740
First off, can it be
my daughter's cat?

338
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:40,641
Okay, but if you get made
because of that, it's on you.

339
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:42,576
Fine.
Let's talk about the cat.

340
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,176
Short-hair, long-hair?
Tabby?

341
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:45,844
Short-hair, calico.

342
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,989
The son is adopted.
Your wife is in a coma.

343
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:49,949
Oh, that's brutal.
I like it.

344
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,683
Hey, guys?
Guys, I really need your help.

345
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:57,916
My little boy,
Brian, my angel,

346
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,319
I bought him
a short-haired calico

347
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,003
after my wife fell into a coma...
Motorcycle crash.

348
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,622
And now the cat's
stuck in a tree.

349
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,923
He's a cute kid.

350
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,190
Kinda looks like you.
Handsome guy.

351
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,558
Handsome little guy.

352
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,126
Oh, hey.
Just got locked out, so...

353
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:10,927
He doesn't care.

354
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:15,096
Brian was adopted,
so he has abandonment issues.

355
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:16,768
Just struck out
at tee-ball last week.

356
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:18,198
Everyone called him
"cryin' Brian."

357
00:12:20,934 --> 00:12:23,168
Hello, Peralta.

358
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:24,303
Aah!

359
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:25,571
You looking for something?

360
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:26,671
What is the deal with you

361
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:28,306
and this second-rate
pizza joint?

362
00:12:28,307 --> 00:12:30,074
This place
is a Brooklyn institution,

363
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:31,708
and I'm here
because you think Sal did it

364
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,708
and you're wrong!

365
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,743
He did do it!

366
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:35,210
Sal was in financial trouble,

367
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:36,812
he has no alibi,

368
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:40,667
and in cases of arson,
the owner always did it.

369
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:41,950
What's going on, sir?

370
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:43,252
What's going on
is that Peralta

371
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:45,020
has screwed with me
for the last time,

372
00:12:45,021 --> 00:12:46,355
and now he's gonna pay.

373
00:12:46,356 --> 00:12:48,557
Oh, you know what, Boone?
Any time you want to...

374
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:51,226
Well, that escalated fast.

375
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,932
They're getting nervous, Jake!
They're getting nervous!

376
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:01,603
Get off him, Boone!
You big marshmallow!

377
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:03,872
Hey, break it up!
Now!

378
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:05,774
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't tell my guys what to do!

379
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,576
Don't tell me what
to tell people what to do!

380
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,077
Well, make me not do it,
tough guy.

381
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,379
Uh-oh.

382
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,367
Hey, break it up!

383
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,013
I apologize, marshal Boone,

384
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:20,715
for Detective Peralta's
actions,

385
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,650
something I find myself
doing quite frequently.

386
00:13:22,684 --> 00:13:24,185
In my defense,
I was the only one

387
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,887
saying we
should stop hitting.

388
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,888
Stop hitting them!

389
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,724
Kicking them will hurt more!

390
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,262
Okay, I'm a reasonable man,
so I'm just gonna say this.

391
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:36,531
Fire Peralta immediately.

392
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:37,832
He started a fight.

393
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,267
He overstepped
his jurisdiction.

394
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,160
And he's obsessed
with this pizza place.

395
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,738
What I'm obsessed with
is how you're bungling

396
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,006
this investigation.

397
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,073
They should
write a song about it

398
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,708
called welcome to the bungle.

399
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,943
Seriously, why are you

400
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,111
dragging Sal's pizza
through the mud?

401
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:50,112
That place is special.

402
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:51,780
Why's it special?

403
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:53,081
Because it's the best pizza
in the neighborhood!

404
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,283
Well...

405
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:55,284
According to Charles's
email blast,

406
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:56,285
it's actually number eight.

407
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:57,553
Captain reads my blast.

408
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:58,587
Of course,
it's the only one

409
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,755
that measures mouth-feel.

410
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,756
What, are you kidding
right now?

411
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,790
This isn't about pizza.

412
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,992
What's it actually about?

413
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,928
When I was a kid,
I was shortstop

414
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,062
on my little league team.

415
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:09,631
Oh, my God.

416
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:11,066
It's the truth.
It's not a brag.

417
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:13,335
My dad was the coach,
and after every game,

418
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:15,003
he would take the team
to Sal's.

419
00:14:15,038 --> 00:14:17,673
Halfway through our last season,
he left me and my mom,

420
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:19,642
and the worst part about it
was that I couldn't

421
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:21,644
go with him
to Sal's anymore.

422
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,613
Well, that's certainly not

423
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,047
what I expected this
to be about.

424
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:28,651
Sorr... I'm sorry.

425
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:30,586
I'm sorry
that happened to you.

426
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:32,121
I mean,
what kind of dad just...

427
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,964
Just leaves his son
like that?

428
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:38,728
Look, you're...
You're a cop and...

429
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:41,764
And I'm a firefighter,
but underneath all of it,

430
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:45,668
we're just two boys
whose dads abandoned them.

431
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:49,772
And you and I, we're gonna
solve this thing, together.

432
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:50,773
- Okay?
- Okay.

433
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:51,841
- Okay.
- Yeah.

434
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,610
But first,
let's hug like men.

435
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,612
Oh, boy.
This is happening.

436
00:14:58,081 --> 00:15:01,150
Captain, get in here.

437
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,285
There, there.

438
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:06,088
There, there.
There.

439
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,389
I'm coming in.

440
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,024
Oh, Boyle.

441
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,392
What's going on?

442
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:12,961
Did you drive me out here
to kill me?

443
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,262
I thought about it,

444
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:15,763
but then I put
that thought on hold.

445
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,265
I wanted to show you
Ropesburg.

446
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,833
This is Ropesburg?

447
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,301
You wanted this offer
so badly,

448
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:23,171
I thought I'd give you
a chance at the job.

449
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,707
Miss Diaz!
Are you here to reconsider?

450
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:27,808
We've bought
the deputies bullets,

451
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:28,808
like you suggested.

452
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,910
Hi, sergeant.

453
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:31,278
No, I'm still not interested.

454
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,646
At all.

455
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:33,947
But this
is Detective Santiago.

456
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:35,649
She's one of
our top detectives,

457
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,317
and she really wants the job.

458
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:40,320
I...
Yes.

459
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:42,723
Can I ask what happened
to the last Captain?

460
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,658
He quit to start
a carpet cleaning business,

461
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,093
because that was better
than being Captain here

462
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:48,729
because this is the most
boring place on earth.

463
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,699
She doesn't mean that.

464
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,200
It's okay.
It's true.

465
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,793
Gotta be known
for something.

466
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:58,305
So of all the candidates

467
00:15:58,306 --> 00:15:59,673
that you interviewed today,

468
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:00,974
who do you think
I should hire?

469
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:04,845
Well, the interviews
got a little off-track.

470
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,015
But I'd go with Simon Walker.

471
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,683
Computer science degree,
worked for the board of ed

472
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:09,684
for ten years.

473
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:10,852
That guy?
No way.

474
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,387
He yelled at me
when I asked him

475
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,856
the same question about Jay-Z
three times in a row.

476
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,157
Why does that matter?

477
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:17,959
Because whoever
takes this I.T. Job

478
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,427
is gonna have
to deal with Hitchcock

479
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:21,395
asking how to log in
to his email

480
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,463
every single day
forever.

481
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:25,299
How do you think
Professor short fuse

482
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,325
is gonna handle that?

483
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:28,069
Fine, what about this guy?

484
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:30,972
Mm, no.
He was scared of everything.

485
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:34,709
Do you remember Rosa's reaction
last time the printer jammed?

486
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:41,315
I'll pay for that.

487
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,017
Fine, what was with
the flossing?

488
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:47,220
Mm, a precinct is a pretty
gross place, ter-bear.

489
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:50,357
There's blood, wounds,
Scully's feet.

490
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:51,925
You need a strong stomach,

491
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:53,794
and that lady
did not have one.

492
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:56,397
Plus, we already have
the perfect candidate already:

493
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:57,865
Savant.

494
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:59,358
That punk who hacked us?

495
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:00,802
Precisely.

496
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:03,772
Captain,
turn your greatest weakness

497
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,106
into your greatest strength,

498
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,775
like Paris Hilton
re: Her sex tape.

499
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,742
Get to the point.

500
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:11,045
Savant tore our walls down,

501
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:13,080
but he can build them
back up,

502
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,182
taller and thicker
than ever.

503
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:17,334
But how can we be sure
he won't turn on us?

504
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:18,953
His mom ratted him out,

505
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,523
so I bet he'd love
a steady paycheck

506
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:23,392
to get out of
that snitch's house.

507
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:25,761
If I had a mic right now,

508
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:28,220
I'd drop it.

509
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:31,432
There we have it.

510
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,203
And here's the file
you wanted.

511
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:38,807
Well, it's hard to believe
I'm gonna say this,

512
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,043
because I've spent most
of my adult life hating you

513
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:42,911
and everything
you stand for, but...

514
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:44,112
Thanks.

515
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,182
I'm not gonna lie,
my therapist

516
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,784
is gonna be
very proud of me.

517
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,152
That's weird.

518
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,286
Any reason you can think of
one of your guys

519
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,420
would've
forced this cabinet open

520
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:53,421
while they
were putting the fire out?

521
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:55,056
No, no.
I can't.

522
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,193
Looks like it was jimmied open
with a crowbar.

523
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:00,928
Oh, my God.
I know who did it.

524
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:02,930
Come on, I'll explain it
on the way down.

525
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:04,799
Wait, wait, wait.

526
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,401
I can't believe
I'm offering this to a cop,

527
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,336
but...

528
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,838
Do you want
to take the pole down?

529
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,430
Oh, my God, yes.

530
00:18:11,441 --> 00:18:14,343
Whee!

531
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,211
Let justice be served.

532
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:17,813
- Did you get it?
- Uh-huh. My turn?

533
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,414
Nope. No time.

534
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,153
Whoo!

535
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,905
We know you burned down
Sal's, gino.

536
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:32,107
You hated him because his pizza
was better than yours.

537
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:33,775
That's not true.

538
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:35,210
Gino's pizza's
always been the tastiest.

539
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,545
Wrong.

540
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:37,813
According to Boyle's
email blast,

541
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,248
it was downright lousy before.

542
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:40,350
That's what made it
so suspicious

543
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:41,885
when he suddenly loved it.

544
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:44,921
Much better than last time.

545
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:47,489
The crust was charred,

546
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,391
the cheese was stringy
and flavorless,

547
00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:50,559
but the sauce.

548
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,028
Oh, Marone, the sauce.

549
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,062
Continue.

550
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:55,263
And that was your mistake.

551
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,564
You didn't
just burn Sal's down,

552
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,933
you also stole
his secret sauce recipe.

553
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:00,802
Here's a picture

554
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:02,904
of the cabinet in which
said recipe was held.

555
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:04,316
Busted open with a crowbar.

556
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,907
Look familiar?

557
00:19:05,908 --> 00:19:08,243
Also, your so-called
motivational speech

558
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:10,279
down at the prison
ended at 5:00 P.M.,

559
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,081
leaving you plenty of time
to get back to Sal's

560
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:13,582
and burn it to the ground.

561
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:16,185
So I guess there's only
one thing left to say.

562
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,287
Gino Bianucci,
you're under arrest...

563
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:19,856
- Excuse me. No.
- Do you mind?

564
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:21,457
This is my collar...
I think I can handle this.

565
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,892
If I'm not wrong.

566
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:24,894
Yeah, but I actually
did all the work.

567
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,396
See, I knew you would...
You know what? Fine.

568
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:28,064
Go ahead, I don't care.

569
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:29,508
Gino Bianucci, you're
under arrest for arson. Yes!

570
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:30,533
- Said it first.
- Real mature.

571
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:31,835
Very mature.

572
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,370
Off we go.

573
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:37,140
So what'd you think
of Ropesburg?

574
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:40,176
It's, uh... quaint.

575
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:41,978
It's whack,
and you know it.

576
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:45,114
Their number-one crime
is tricycle theft.

577
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:46,882
There's a bakery
attached to the precinct.

578
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,150
Come on, Santiago.

579
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:49,919
You never would've
taken that job,

580
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,888
so why'd you even care
that they offered it to me?

581
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,624
I can't help it.
I'm competitive.

582
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,927
I have seven brothers,
and I was the only girl.

583
00:19:56,928 --> 00:19:59,062
I always had to fight
for a place at the table.

584
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:01,630
Well, you're not the only girl
at the table anymore.

585
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:03,965
We work in a police force
full of dudes.

586
00:20:03,966 --> 00:20:05,486
We gotta have
each other's backs, okay?

587
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,202
You saying you have my back?

588
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:09,903
Yeah, I got your back.

589
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,271
Don't smile.
I'm still mad at you.

590
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:12,873
I thought we were
having a moment.

591
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:14,341
Moment's over.
Shut up.

592
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:16,555
Hey, sarge.

593
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:18,412
He made my computer smarter.

594
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:20,414
All I have to do
is put my thumb on that thing,

595
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:22,183
and it opens up
all my electric mails.

596
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:25,553
You seem real smart, man.

597
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:27,889
Oh, and look,
and you play with toys.

598
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,924
Savant, you're part
of the nine-nine now.

599
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,192
We look after each other.

600
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:33,260
Hey, ball,

601
00:20:33,294 --> 00:20:35,362
if savant
was to do anything

602
00:20:35,363 --> 00:20:38,202
to harm this precinct,
would I destroy him?

603
00:20:40,068 --> 00:20:43,204
Answer uncertain.
Try again.

604
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,141
Peralta, fire marshal Boone
just called.

605
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:49,143
He told me you should
check your drawer?

606
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:54,549
Oh, look at that.

607
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,951
I've been booned.

608
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:58,219
Well, the joke's on him,

609
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,634
because I was out
of shaving cream.

610
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:02,691
I see we are once again at war
with the fire department.

611
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,098
You are not to retaliate.

612
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:05,619
Oh, I wouldn't dream
of it, sir.

613
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,499
In fact, I'm gonna send over
a little peace offering:

614
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,699
Some of Sal's famous sauce.

615
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,699
Now, Boyle!

616
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:15,078
Fire! Fire! Fire!

617
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:18,832
Pleasure working
with you, Boone.

618
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,272
Run, Charles!

619
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:25,288
Come on... whoa!
Get that guy!

620
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:29,233
