1
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:05,786
Whoa. What's with the cast?
I sprained my wrist.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,120
Oh, no!
What happened?

3
00:00:07,155 --> 00:00:08,822
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.

4
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:09,990
Yeah! Geez, Amy.

5
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:11,024
Back off.

6
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,292
Leave the guy alone.

7
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:13,573
All right, huddle up, everybody.

8
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:14,828
Bring it in, bring it in!

9
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,163
So he wouldn't say what happened,

10
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:17,664
which can only mean one thing.

11
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,933
- He's in a fight club.
- No.

12
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:22,869
He did it doing something he's
embarrassed by, like smiling.

13
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,371
Only question is, how do you
hurt your arm smiling?

14
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:25,672
Could be a sports injury.

15
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:28,308
I sprained my wrist in college
playing field hockey.

16
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:30,777
Men's field hockey?
Yeah.

17
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:32,512
It's much more violent
than the women's game.

18
00:00:32,513 --> 00:00:35,115
We're not allowed to wear anything
that protects our breasts.

19
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:36,817
Attention, everyone,
I can hear you speculating

20
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:39,820
about the nature and origin
of my injury from my office.

21
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,622
I tripped over an uneven sidewalk.

22
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:44,591
I did not think
it was relevant to your jobs,

23
00:00:44,592 --> 00:00:48,128
the jobs which you should all
be doing right now.

24
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:49,729
Get to work.

25
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:55,568
Do you wanna know
how I actually hurt my wrist?

26
00:00:55,603 --> 00:00:57,403
Yes.

27
00:00:57,404 --> 00:00:59,072
I was hula-hooping.

28
00:00:59,073 --> 00:01:02,408
Kevin and I attend a class
for fitness and for fun.

29
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:03,443
Oh, my God.

30
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:05,412
I've mastered all the moves.

31
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:07,547
The pizza toss...

32
00:01:07,548 --> 00:01:08,715
The tornado...

33
00:01:08,716 --> 00:01:11,951
The scorpion, the oopsie doodle.

34
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:15,221
Why are you telling me this?

35
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:18,391
Because no one...
Will ever believe you.

36
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:20,093
No. No!

37
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,432
You sick son of a bitch.

00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:46,786
Hey, hey!

40
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:49,829
What has three thumbs
and just made another arrest?

41
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,758
This guy!

42
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,793
It doesn't work if you don't
put your thumb up.

43
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:54,961
Thank you!

44
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:57,597
23 solves in one month.
New precinct record!

45
00:01:57,598 --> 00:01:58,998
Yeah!

46
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,433
Thank you, thanks.

47
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:01,801
Dance with me, Jakey.

48
00:02:03,204 --> 00:02:05,638
Ha! No, and I will never dance
to that song.

49
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:07,607
Wait to go, Jakey!
Whoa!

50
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:10,310
Are those thumbtacks?
What the hell, Scully?

51
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:11,784
I thought they'd make good confetti.

52
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:13,413
Why?

53
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,215
This took a lot of hard work
and a lot of late nights.

54
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:16,716
Take the weekend off, Peralta.

55
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:17,817
Thank you.

56
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,419
You know, I actually might.

57
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,788
I'm severely sleep-deprived
and I'm way behind on laundry.

58
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:23,656
Good work.
Oh.

59
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,558
That's nice.

60
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,793
Hey!

61
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,061
What's with the bag?

62
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:30,597
Are you going on a cruise
with your mom... in 1913?

63
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,532
This is a very stylish bag.

64
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,401
Teddy and I are going to
the Berkshires for the weekend.

65
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:36,403
Oh, for like a police conference?

66
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:38,238
Nope, just a romantic getaway.

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,806
Wow!

68
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:42,008
That's great.
I know.

69
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:45,078
We're kind of taking things
to the next level.

70
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:46,346
What are you doing this weekend?

71
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,448
Oh, opposite of the Berkshires.

72
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,984
Work-shires.
Working, whole weekend.

73
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,452
Fighting crime.

74
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:54,187
I thought you were taking
the weekend off to do your laundry.

75
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:58,258
Does crime take the weekend off
to do its laundry, Scully?

76
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,194
No, it doesn't.
Sorry.

77
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:05,131
Can I call you back?
Bye.

78
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:07,233
What's up?
Looking for paper towels.

79
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,069
What are you doing in here?
Talking to Vivian.

80
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,771
We're still trying to figure out
whether we should move to Canada.

81
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:13,173
It's awful!

82
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:15,208
Thank God it hasn't affected
how much we bathe together.

83
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,242
Almost never?

84
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:17,410
All the time.

85
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:18,712
Thing is it's so hard to talk at work

86
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:19,813
because there's no privacy.

87
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:22,882
The roof is freezing, the
holding cell is full of perps,

88
00:03:22,917 --> 00:03:24,818
and their romantic advice is not great.

89
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,021
It's always to tell Vivian,
"bitch, get your life right!"

90
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:30,557
I tried it.
She did not like it.

91
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,158
Let me work on it.

92
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:39,999
Hands up, cop.

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,434
Hey... no, no.
Oh, no, no!

94
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:42,702
It's Teddy, your boyfriend!

95
00:03:42,737 --> 00:03:44,971
Aww, boyfriend.
Yeah.

96
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,506
Can you release my arm?

97
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:47,774
Oh, yeah!
Sorry.

98
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:48,942
Good one.

99
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:50,110
Thanks.

100
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,511
What are you doing here?

101
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:53,646
Oh, I just wanted to see you
before we left for the weekend.

102
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:55,448
Aw, that's so gross.

103
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,873
What's this weekend?

104
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:58,385
We rented a cabin in the Berkshires.

105
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:00,286
We're taking a couples cooking class,

106
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:01,878
and there's this great antiques fair.

107
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,692
Sounds like you two have a wonderful
lesbian vacation planned.

108
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:08,862
Now my question is, will you
be back tomorrow afternoon?

109
00:04:08,863 --> 00:04:10,397
Because that is when you promised Holt

110
00:04:10,398 --> 00:04:12,899
you'd help with
his community outreach meeting.

111
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,501
That's this weekend?

112
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:16,336
I totally forgot.

113
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,171
How did I let the Captain
talk me into that?

114
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:19,272
Excuse me, everyone.

115
00:04:19,306 --> 00:04:20,273
Would one of you be willing to...

116
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:21,508
Me! I'll do it!

117
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:23,191
I volunteer all my time.

118
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,612
Crap.
What am I gonna do?

119
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,181
Well, it's okay.
We can reschedule.

120
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:30,283
I mean, we'll lose the deposit, but...

121
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:33,019
Or you could just lie to Captain Holt.

122
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,790
That's my policy for everything
and it always works.

123
00:04:36,824 --> 00:04:38,158
I'm not gonna lie.

124
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,494
I'll just tell the Captain I made
a mistake, and he'll understand.

125
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:42,695
Kay.

126
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:45,498
But if you do lie, you can't go
wrong with dental emergency.

127
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:47,333
Or death of a triplet.

128
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:49,135
Now that one you can use twice.

129
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:50,870
Smart.

130
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:52,305
Good news, sergeant.

131
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:54,681
I figured out what we're
gonna work on this weekend.

132
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,943
I'm working on spending time
with my family.

133
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,845
We're having a fancy tea party.

134
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,547
I am the King of origami napkins.

135
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:01,815
Oh, that's nice.

136
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,149
I thought you were taking the weekend off.

137
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,985
No, I decided to spend the weekend
taking things to the next level.

138
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,360
Work-wise.

139
00:05:07,388 --> 00:05:09,422
I found a cold case of ours
that everyone foolishly said

140
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:11,491
was unsolvable.

141
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,127
Case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ.

142
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:17,263
Jake, case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ
is unsolvable.

143
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:23,136
Or maybe case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ is
waiting for someone to de-unsolve it.

144
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:26,005
What's case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ?

145
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:29,042
Case 52ABX... we gotta find a way
to abbreviate this thing.

146
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:31,111
Anyway, it's an old case
that the sarge and I worked

147
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:32,479
about eight years ago.

148
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,647
This guy Nate Dexter was
murdered in a boat explosion.

149
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,183
No witnesses, no leads, minimal evidence.

150
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:38,585
This case almost killed us.

151
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:39,819
Yeah, but I'm on a hot streak!

152
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,788
Plus we're better detectives now.

153
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:45,425
We're smarter, computers are
faster, no more blockbuster.

154
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:47,394
Drones?

155
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:49,729
I'm feeling it.

156
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:51,731
That was creepy.

157
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:53,199
But... convincing.

158
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,834
Oh, he's standing up.

159
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,403
I've always wanted to solve that case.

160
00:05:56,437 --> 00:05:58,405
Then think about how good
it would feel to finally do it.

161
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,539
What's the best moment of your life?

162
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,207
My wedding day.

163
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,842
Tied with the day my babies were born.

164
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:06,413
Compared to this,
those memories will be garbage.

165
00:06:06,447 --> 00:06:08,181
You don't know what you're saying.

166
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:10,350
'Cause I'm not married
and I don't have kids. Right?

167
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,966
Okay.

168
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,183
Okay, here's what we know.

169
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:18,386
Nate Dexter was a small-time
crook who pissed someone off.

170
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:19,987
They blew up his boat,
with him still on it,

171
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:22,656
and left no evidence
except this one charred finger

172
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:24,258
and Nate's melted torso.

173
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,993
Man, I'm having deja vu right now.

174
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:28,829
Whoever did it left no evidence,
except one charred finger

175
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:31,098
and Nate's melted torso.

176
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,534
So in other words nothing's changed.

177
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:34,735
Except our attitudes.

178
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,171
So! We start at the last place

179
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:38,806
that Dexter was seen
before he went to the marina...

180
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,341
His apartment.

181
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:43,411
I'm telling you, sarge,
I got a good feeling about this.

182
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,747
Aw, no!

183
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,049
Well, it appears
his building was torn down.

184
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:52,186
I know this seems like bad
news, but on the plus side

185
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:55,189
the harder the solve the sweeter the solve.

186
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:56,624
No, it's just bad news.

187
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:57,691
You're bad news.

188
00:06:57,726 --> 00:06:59,059
What?
What?

189
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,462
Just saying you're bad news for bad guys,

190
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,698
'cause you're a number-one cop.

191
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,734
Blacker the Berry the sweeter the juice!

192
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,135
What?
What?

193
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,703
Let's solve the case!

194
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:11,439
Hey!

195
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,074
We need to tell Charles about Babylon.

196
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:15,109
He needs a private place to talk to Vivian.

197
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,245
What? No!
Babylon's our secret place.

198
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:21,649
It's the best thing in my life,
and I have a very full life.

199
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,752
Do you know I know Papa John?
The Papa John.

200
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:25,986
Someone is lying to you.

201
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,221
We can't tell Charles.

202
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:29,256
He's incapable of keeping a secret.

203
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:30,758
I shouldn't tell you this,

204
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,161
but we're throwing you
a surprise party later!

205
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,163
Look, we tell Charles about Babylon,

206
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,199
or I shred your nap blanket
into a million tiny rags.

207
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:41,502
No! I love wolfie.
Fine! You win!

208
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,304
Tell Charles.

209
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,306
Hold me close, little wolfie.

210
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:46,707
Hold me.

211
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:49,110
All right, convict.

212
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:51,645
What do you know
about the murder of Nate Dexter?

213
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,814
Look, I'll tell you the same thing...

214
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,302
I told you eight years ago.

215
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,017
I don't know anything about Nate Dexter.

216
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:58,185
And even if I did...

217
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,954
The best French toast I ever ate

218
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:01,756
was with mayor Lindsay's dog.

219
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:05,226
He's very old, he's lost his mind.

220
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,982
We're making progress!

221
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:11,298
Hello, Captain, my old friend.

222
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,833
I've come to talk with you...

223
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,135
Again.

224
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:15,503
I've lapsed into song lyrics.

225
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:16,771
Santiago, can I help you?

226
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:19,407
I need to speak with you
about this weekend.

227
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:20,908
Yes, I'm so happy you'll be there

228
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:22,676
to oversee
the audio-visual presentation.

229
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:25,279
The last time did not...
Go well.

230
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:27,081
The next chart shows
the drop in the crime rate

231
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:29,650
over the last month.

232
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,089
I just erased everything.

233
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,160
I'm so sorry, but I think I'm gonna
be unable to help out tomorrow.

234
00:08:39,194 --> 00:08:41,328
Why is that?

235
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:42,830
Dental emergency.

236
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:45,633
I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled.

237
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,334
Wow, you must be in a lotta pain.

238
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:49,270
Yeah, I've been in pain for days.

239
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:51,105
I had no idea you were living like this.

240
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:52,206
No one knows.

241
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,809
I am a rock.
I am an island.

242
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,811
I have lapsed into song lyrics again.

243
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,145
Okay.

244
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:00,981
That's all of 'em.

245
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:03,050
What? What about to Frank Williams?

246
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,318
He's in the infirmary.

247
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,188
He was beat up pretty good,
a lot of internal bleeding.

248
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,589
Awesome!

249
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,124
I mean, not the internal bleeding thing.

250
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,459
That sounds horrifying.

251
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,793
But I bet you we can get him to talk

252
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:14,295
if we offer to move him
from his current address

253
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:15,730
on beatdown boulevard.

254
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,532
That's a great idea.
Looks like we got lucky.

255
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:19,867
Hey, side note...

256
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:21,068
"Beatdown boulevard,"

257
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:22,470
good name for my debut hip-hop record.

258
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:24,572
Strongly disagree.
Okay.

259
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,807
Will you just tell me where we're going?

260
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:29,744
Guys? Guys!

261
00:09:29,745 --> 00:09:31,879
Oh, my God, you're gonna beat me up.

262
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:36,851
Welcome to Babylon!

263
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:38,986
It's our secret bathroom.

264
00:09:38,987 --> 00:09:40,821
It's so beautiful.

265
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:42,690
There used to be a transit
police squad down here.

266
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:45,559
This was a Captain's bathroom.
I found it a while back.

267
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:47,395
She told me about it a year ago

268
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:48,963
when I got stomach flu
from that sewer rave.

269
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,598
Fun night though.

270
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,100
We put a lotta effort
into making this place nice.

271
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,668
Look.

272
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:55,903
Weird crystals.

273
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,506
Also, lavender-scented candles,

274
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,044
a zebra-skin rug, and the toilet
paper is, triple-ply.

275
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,311
Wow.

276
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,147
It turns anyone's bottom into a VIP.

277
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,415
More importantly...

278
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,783
It has great cell service.

279
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:11,419
We thought you could use this place
to call Vivian when you need to.

280
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:14,388
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone about this.

281
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:15,923
I pinky promise.

282
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:17,925
Not good enough.

283
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:19,960
Blood pact!

284
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,762
All right, Frank, let's recap, shall we?

285
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:24,465
You slipped and fell onto a shiv.

286
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,702
Then you got up and fell
backwards onto another shiv.

287
00:10:27,703 --> 00:10:31,439
And finally one last shiv fell from
the ceiling and into your body.

288
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,773
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

289
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:34,141
I think you got shivved.

290
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,543
What do you guys want?

291
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:36,744
We wanna make a deal.

292
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:38,646
You know anything
about the murder of Nate Dexter?

293
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:39,780
Maybe.

294
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:41,749
What do I get if I do?

295
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,250
How about a transfer to another cell block?

296
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,719
One with fewer shivs.

297
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,920
Okay.

298
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:47,855
I can't be sure,

299
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:51,092
but I think Dexter owed money
to a guy named Sam Bunsen.

300
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:52,960
And... that's a new lead!

301
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:55,062
First lead in eight years.

302
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:56,330
You were right.

303
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:58,799
♪ Beatdown boulevard ♪

304
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,167

How are your teeth feeling?

310
00:11:07,976 --> 00:11:09,477
Oh.

311
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:10,745
Dental emergency?

312
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,713
Yes, it just sorta happened.

313
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:16,117
It still hurts, but I can
make it till tomorrow.

314
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:18,686
Well, if you're in this much pain,
I don't think you should wait.

315
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:19,987
My brother-in-law is
one of the top oral surgeons

316
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:21,122
in the quint-state area.

317
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,491
That's two better
than the tri-state area.

318
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:24,959
He's agreed to see you tonight at 6:00

319
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,028
as a personal favor to me and Kevin.

320
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,296
Wow! Tonight!

321
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:30,798
Thank you.

322
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:33,467
But that's not gonna work...

323
00:11:33,468 --> 00:11:35,169
Because of the anesthesia

324
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,604
and driving myself home.

325
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,939
I'll just go tomorrow.
Teddy can take me.

326
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,441
Nonsense.

327
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:43,044
I'll drive you to and from
the dentist's office myself.

328
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:47,581
That's great, just great.

329
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,150
He's a good dude.

330
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:51,852
He's a good, good dude.

331
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:53,487
Hey, sarge.

332
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:55,589
No sign of Sam Bunsen
in the federal database.

333
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:57,224
You got anything?
Bad news.

334
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,894
I only found his wife and she hasn't
heard from him in eight years.

335
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,629
That doesn't sound good.
Yeah.

336
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,898
That's why I started
by saying "bad news."

337
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,233
Terry believes in having
a clear topic sentence.

338
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:09,070
I bet Mrs. Bunsen is lying.
She knows where her husband is.

339
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,805
I pushed pretty hard.

340
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:12,506
She said she's willing
to take a lie detector test.

341
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,342
Well, then let's bust out the polygraph.

342
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,143
Lie detector truth or dare!

343
00:12:16,144 --> 00:12:17,545
No. Boyle, last time we did that,

344
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:19,313
you ended up telling everyone
you had a crush on the teapot

345
00:12:19,314 --> 00:12:20,715
from Beauty and the Beast.

346
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:22,650
It's the way they drew her.

347
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:29,809
All right, pretty boy, where is it?

348
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,401
Where's what?

349
00:12:31,436 --> 00:12:32,435
The secret bathroom.

350
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:35,239
Secret what?
Bathroom where?

351
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,673
Okay, Captain, I'll be right there!

352
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,542
Don't lie to us.

353
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:40,144
We've been watching you.

354
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:44,681
11:18 A.M., Rosa told you to follow
her, and you guys left together.

355
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:48,252
You returned at 11:31
smelling of lavender.

356
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:52,756
And you've been drinking
chamomile tea all day long

357
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:54,691
and haven't been to the men's room once.

358
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:57,261
Since when are you two
so into being good detectives?

359
00:12:57,295 --> 00:12:58,829
Since it came to secret bathrooms.

360
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,297
Tell us where it is!

361
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:02,099
Now!

362
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,668
Okay! Please state
your name one more time.

363
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,537
Are we really doing this again?

364
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:07,938
It's, like, the fifth time.

365
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:10,441
That's a lie!
It's only the fourth time!

366
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:11,775
No?

367
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:13,477
Okay, my bad.
Continue.

368
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:17,915
I'm Sophia Bunsen, I haven't talked
to my husband in eight years.

369
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,218
This is Nate Dexter.
He was friends with my husband.

370
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:23,187
I didn't know he was dead.

371
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:27,191
You think my husband killed him,
but I guarantee that's impossible.

372
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:30,027
Okay.
Good.

373
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:32,062
But not good enough!
Let's do it again.

374
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,731
Jake, what's going on with you?

375
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,332
She passed the test like five times.

376
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,935
Or maybe...
She's in cahoots.

377
00:13:37,936 --> 00:13:40,003
With him!

378
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:41,305
Are you two cahooting?

379
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,606
Are you cahooting?

380
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:44,174
Jake!
It's over, man.

381
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,542
We had a lead, now it's dead.

382
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:47,378
It happens!
No.

383
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,946
If it's not her, and it's not him...

384
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:50,914
Which I'm still not
convinced of, by the way,

385
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,416
then it's gotta be the machine.

386
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,817
Strap me in, sergeant.

387
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:56,754
I'm taking this thing
for a test drive of truth.

388
00:13:57,622 --> 00:13:59,256
Thanks for taking us, Marty.

389
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:00,824
Please, Ray, we're family.

390
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:04,495
Neither of us can understand you at all.

391
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,198
The visual examination
doesn't show much inflammation,

392
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:10,467
but these x-rays should be more telling.

393
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:12,803
Let's see what's beneath the surface.

394
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:14,004
Oh, stop!

395
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,539
Santiago.

396
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,274
I...

397
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,009
Oh, God.

398
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,045
I forgot I promised to help you,

399
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:23,447
and I made plans to go to the
Berkshires with my boyfriend.

400
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:24,481
Oh.

401
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:26,784
Wait.

402
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:30,621
So you lied to me to get out of work?

403
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:31,855
Yes.

404
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,992
I may be a liar, but I've got great teeth.

405
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:36,927
And no one can take that from me.

406
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,296
Have you heard of "over-brushing?"

407
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:40,464
Oh, no.

408
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:42,166
Your aggressive technique has stripped away

409
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,102
the protective enamel and much of your gum.

410
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:47,805
You have seven cavities.

411
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,775
I have to say...
I feel like you deserve this.

412
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,111
Charles!

413
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:55,579
What the hell is wrong with you?

414
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,081
You told Hitchcock and Scully?

415
00:14:58,149 --> 00:14:59,550
No! What?

416
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,319
Yep, this... is... happening.

417
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,787
They were scary.

418
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:05,422
It was like that moment in Planet of Apes

419
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:06,657
when the monkey talked.

420
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:08,392
Look, I'm sorry.

421
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:09,826
You let me into your special place.

422
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:12,262
Ew.
I messed up, and I'll fix it.

423
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:13,597
It's okay, Charles, you don't have to.

424
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:17,134
No! It's not okay.
Babylon hath fallen.

425
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:19,970
Charles betrayed us
and I will make him pay for it.

426
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,071
Gina, enough.

427
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:22,840
Boyle needed a bathroom,
so we told him about it.

428
00:15:22,841 --> 00:15:24,775
Just like I told you when you needed it?

429
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,243
Leave him alone.
He saved my life.

430
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:27,778
Plus... he's pitiful.

431
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,146
And his life is crap right now.

432
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,950
Yeah! It is!
Thank you, Rosa.

433
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:35,185
I'm telling you this machine is broken.

434
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,520
Ask me a question.

435
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,489
Is Jay Z really your favorite artist?

436
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:39,656
Yes, obviously.

437
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:41,425
Lie.

438
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,227
See? It's busted.
Is it?

439
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:45,362
Or is your favorite artist
really Taylor Swift?

440
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:47,464
No.

441
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:48,966
Lie.
All right, fine.

442
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,834
She is.

443
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,369
She makes me feel things.

444
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:55,072
She makes me all of us feel things!

445
00:15:55,073 --> 00:15:58,008
Look, that machine is working just fine.

446
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:00,110
Why are you being so crazy about this case?

447
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:02,046
I wanted to work the toughest case we had.

448
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,514
Why?

449
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:04,848
Because it would feel awesome to solve it.

450
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:06,617
Because a real man
doesn't run from a challenge.

451
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:08,886
I mean, do they run
from the bulls in Pamplona?

452
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,954
Yeah. That's the whole point of it.

453
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:13,223
Seriously?
That seems lame.

454
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:15,492
I don't know why you wanna spend
the entire weekend at work,

455
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:16,827
but I'm going home to my family.

456
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,829
See you tomorrow, Jake.

457
00:16:18,863 --> 00:16:20,698
Fine, abandon me!

458
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:22,633
I don't want you here anyway.

459
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:23,701
That's a lie.

460
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:25,636
Come on, man.

461
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,306
I got here an hour early.
This better be good.

462
00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:31,241
Holy Moses!

463
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:32,643
What happened to you?

464
00:16:32,644 --> 00:16:35,813
I have not slept in, since I
last saw you, many hours.

465
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:37,314
Plus, I think I'm hallucinating

466
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:40,050
because I'm pretty sure I just
heard your biceps mocking me.

467
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:41,752
No, that's possible.

468
00:16:41,753 --> 00:16:43,921
My biceps mock a lotta people.

469
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:45,155
Good to know.

470
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:48,692
So I rewatched the
interrogation, and get this.

471
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:50,594
Sophia wasn't lying about anything.

472
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:52,262
She doesn't know who killed Nate Dexter.

473
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:56,333
But... she does know
something way better.

474
00:16:56,334 --> 00:17:00,070
Come with me.

475
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:02,840
Jake!

476
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:04,241
People normally move after they say that.

477
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,610
Oh, yeah, I feel asleep for a second.

478
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:08,345
Sorry.

479
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:10,114
Come with me.

480
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:13,615
Okay!

481
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:15,617
Y'all ready for this?
You know what I'm saying?

482
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,154
Terry Jeffords,
allow me to introduce to you...

483
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:23,591
Our murder victim,
the not-dead Nate Dexter.

484
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:25,260
What the hell is going on?

485
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:27,228
Right?

486
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,596
Sophia wasn't lying.

487
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,165
I was just not asking the right questions.

488
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,879
She hadn't seen her husband in eight years,

489
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:34,669
but she was positive there's
no way that he killed Dexter.

490
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,672
That's when it occurred to me,
no one killed him.

491
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:40,175
Hey, Nate, just talking
about how you're alive.

492
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:42,243
Yeah, I'm alive.

493
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,245
But whose melted torso did we find?

494
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,116
Sophia's husband.

495
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,317
Yes!

496
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,386
Sophia and Dexter were having an affair,

497
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,855
husband found out, Nate killed him.

498
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:55,857
Now I'm telling my friend
about how you killed that guy.

499
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:57,392
It was for love!

500
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:58,993
Cool motive, still a murder.

501
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,995
Also, you remember that severed finger?

502
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,564
Check this out.
Hey, Nate.

503
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,966
Show us your hands, please?

504
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,001
Ho-ho!
Right?

505
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,771
Cut it off himself.
How screwed up is that?

506
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,173
Anyway, I asked all of my CIs
if they had dealings

507
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,508
with a nine-fingered man.

508
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,044
Unsolvable case...
Solved!

509
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,245
Whoo!

510
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,948
What'd you wanna talk to us about?

511
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,649
Well, I got Hitchcock and Scully

512
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,818
to promise never to use our bathroom again.

513
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,253
How'd you do that?

514
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:27,655
The Donald and I call it
"the art of the deal."

515
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,357
You want your bathroom back, fine.

516
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,092
I want your chair.
Mine smells like my butt.

517
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,127
Ew! Fine.

518
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,595
And we want your coyote blanket.

519
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:35,296
It's not a coyote, it's a wolf.

520
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:36,998
Learn your animals, idiot.

521
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,266
Told you she wasn't serious.

522
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,834
Let's go, Scully.

523
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,069
Fine!

524
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,670
I can't believe you gave up wolfie.

525
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:43,772
It was worth it.

526
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,441
Plus, I'm done with wolves now.

527
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,143
I'm into angry unicorns.

528
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:52,414
If I was a unicorn, I'd never be angry.

529
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:53,948
Jake!

530
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,517
Nice job on the case.
Great solve!

531
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,685
Thanks. Aren't you supposed
to be in the Berkshires?

532
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,487
I had a dental thing.

533
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:00,622
But you're such a good brusher.

534
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:01,990
I know!

535
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:03,391
Turns out that was my undoing.

536
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,060
Classic.
Yeah.

537
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,428
Hey, you remember Teddy.

538
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:07,762
Oh! Yeah. Hey, man.
How are you?

539
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,064
Great solve.

540
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,832
Can I buy you a Pilsner?
They have awesome Pilsners here.

541
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,200
Teddy's really into Pilsners.

542
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:13,435
Cool!

543
00:19:13,436 --> 00:19:14,736
Attention!

544
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:19,541
Everyone raise your glasses
to the amazing Jake Peralta!

545
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,943
Today, he did the impossible.

546
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:25,547
He closed case 52abx-dash-32qj.

547
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,150
Speech, speech, speech!

548
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:31,386
Look, the real hero here is the murderer.

549
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,987
Because without him
there wouldn't be a case.

550
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:36,224
So... here's to Nate Dexter,
the murderer.

551
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,433
Captain... I wanna
apologize for lying.

552
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:47,735
Thank you.

553
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:49,437
Next time just talk to me.

554
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,073
Okay.

555
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:55,309
Now I know this comes
on the heels of betraying you,

556
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,478
but... can I have next weekend off

557
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,614
to go to that cabin
in the Berkshires with Teddy?

558
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,020
Okay.

559
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,789
Thank you, sir.

560
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:15,897
I still can't feel my mouth.
Did a little bit dribble out?

561
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:18,266
What's going on with you?

562
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,734
For the past two days,

563
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:21,435
you've been telling me
how amazing it was gonna be

564
00:20:21,436 --> 00:20:22,803
to solve this case.

565
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,605
This does not look amazing.

566
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:25,873
I don't know, man.

567
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:27,808
I thought I'd be more psyched too.

568
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,044
Maybe I just need a cooler case.
No.

569
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:32,413
That is not gonna work.

570
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:34,649
You set the precinct record,
you weren't happy.

571
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:37,952
You solved an unsolvable case,
you weren't happy.

572
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,620
No case is gonna make you happy.

573
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:42,356
Something's bothering you.

574
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:45,726
And whatever it is you gotta deal with it.

575
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:49,330
Yeah, well, maybe I can't
deal with it right now, or...

576
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,798
You know, whatever.

577
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,769
I know!

578
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,404
Oh.

579
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:57,638
That's a tough one.

580
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,373
Yeah.

581
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:02,109
But solving more cases isn't
gonna make you feel any better.

582
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,414
Having a drink with a friend might though.

583
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:10,618
Thank you, but I don't think
another drink is gonna help.

584
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,386
I think having a lot more drinks
might help.

585
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:15,022
There he is!

586
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,493
So...
Amy?

587
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,128
We're gonna need some shots.

588

I hate myself right now.
