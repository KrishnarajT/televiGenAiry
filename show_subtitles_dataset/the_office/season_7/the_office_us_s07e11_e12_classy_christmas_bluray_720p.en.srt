1
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:04,201
Got it.
All right.

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:06,303
Okay, let's go in.
I'm freezing.
People, wait, wait, wait.

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,668
Come back, come back.
One fun one.

4
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:09,036
We're gonna do a fun one.
Okay.

5
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:11,803
One Charlie's Angels.
One. Let's go.

6
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,902
Okay,
this is just a Christmas card
from your paper supplier.

7
00:00:14,978 --> 00:00:16,139
No one's putting
this on their fridge.

8
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:18,273
I got it, you guys,
how about this.

9
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:20,577
Michael, what if all the boys
are on one side,

10
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:21,946
all the girls
are on the other.

11
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,284
The boys are, like,
"Why, I ought to..."

12
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:26,687
And the girls are, like,
"Let's go shopping."

13
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,187
Let's just jump in the air.
That's it!

14
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:30,886
That's a picture!
Yes! Jump in the air.

15
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,259
We're gonna jump in the air.
Here we go.

16
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,356
Okay, one, two, three.

17
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:37,791
Not everyone jumped.

18
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:40,463
Okay, everybody jump
in the air this time, please.

19
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:41,595
Here we go.

20
00:00:41,672 --> 00:00:43,300
One, two, three.

21
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:46,272
Still some people not jumping.
You gotta be kidding me.

22
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,278
Who isn't jumping?
I'll tell you who.

23
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,974
Darryl, Phyllis,
Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.

24
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,072
I am jumping.

25
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:53,845
You are?
Let me see you jump.
Yes, I'm jumping.

26
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:57,316
Oh, my God. This is
a store-bought camera.

27
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:59,219
This isn't one of those
special military-grade cameras

28
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:00,450
that would be
able to capture that.

29
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:01,583
I'm freezing.

30
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:03,718
Also, Erin is
jumping way too early.

31
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:04,988
She's on the ground
by "three."

32
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,155
I didn't want to miss it.

33
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,130
Well, if we all jump
really high,

34
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:09,826
we'll be in the air longer.
Do that.

35
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,391
Here's a question
nobody's asking,

36
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:12,868
is this worth it?
Don't answer that.

37
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,404
People,
listen up and listen good.

38
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,565
We need to just
get one picture

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,666
where we're all in the air
at the same time. Yes?

40
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:20,040
Why?
I believe in us.

41
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,203
We can do this.

42
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:23,247
Okay, on three,
everyone in the air.

43
00:01:23,647 --> 00:01:26,776
Three, two, one, zero.

44
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,910
Just say "jump."
Say the word "jump."

45
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,615
We didn't get it.

46
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,579
I'm the office
administrator now,

47
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,984
which means I'm
basically being paid

48
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:04,021
to be head of the
party planning committee.

49
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:07,086
The first thing I did
as head, I shut it down.

50
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:10,753
At its worst it was
a toxic political club

51
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:15,026
used to make others feel
miserable and left out.

52
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:18,063
At its best
it planned parties.

53
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,964
It hardly looks fake.
It's so lush.

54
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,300
Why does it smell real?

55
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:25,197
JIM: Ah!

56
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:26,899
Good one.

57
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:31,839
Ho, ho, ho!
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

58
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:34,680
Merry Christmas,
little children!

59
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:35,810
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

60
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,549
How's everybody doing today?
PAM: Good.

61
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:41,156
How's the party coming along?
Great.

62
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:43,490
Are we over budget?
Nope.

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,729
No? Good.

64
00:02:45,796 --> 00:02:48,459
Did anyone
get drunk already?

65
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:50,727
Not yet.
Good for you.

66
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,635
Angela, lay it on me,
what's the problem?

67
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:55,497
Nothing. Should be fun.

68
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:59,134
So, Stanley,
how big is the bug
up your butt today?

69
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:02,041
Pam got those
sugar-free cookies I like.
I'm doing fine.

70
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:05,774
All right, well,
I will be in my office

71
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,375
making toys for
the good children.

72
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:11,086
Andy?
Yeah?

73
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:12,688
What you got?

74
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,283
It's all good, Santa.

75
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:15,754
Well, that's a relief.

76
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:18,125
Santa's gonna take
some much-needed free time.

77
00:03:19,029 --> 00:03:20,759
All right. Good!

78
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,766
MICHAEL: My kids
are growing up.

79
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:25,731
As a boss, I look at that
and I say, "Great."

80
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:29,637
It is exactly what a boss
would hope would happen

81
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,265
because that's what I want.

82
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,310
That's what
every boss wants,

83
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:36,938
is a wonderful Christmas
with no drama.

84
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:44,081
It's present time, you guys.

85
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:48,292
Happy holidays from
your friends at Sabre.

86
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,486
We just want to say
how grateful we are.

87
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,722
Sabre is actively looking
for ways to involve me

88
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:54,765
as minority executive trainee.

89
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:58,129
So I suggested choosing
the annual Christmas gift
to the employees.

90
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,170
And they said,
"Oh, yes. Perfect.

91
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:03,332
"Thank you, Kelly. Finally,
something for you to do."

92
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,269
It's a Hello Kitty
laptop sleeve.

93
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,709
Hello Kitty's for girls.

94
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,439
Nashua got mp3 players.

95
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:11,175
Yeah, I don't even
have a laptop.

96
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:13,911
I wonder if these
presents would be under
as much scrutiny

97
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:15,418
if I were white.
WOMAN: Wow.

98
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:17,010
Come on.
I said "I wonder."

99
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:18,680
I didn't say "I think."

100
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:21,257
Kelly, I thought we agreed
on fleece blankets.

101
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:23,084
Blankets?
What am I, five?

102
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,959
Erin and I make
great use of ours.

103
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:28,655
Yes, Erin and I
are still dating.

104
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:31,995
Why do you ask me so often
if we're still dating?

105
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:34,861
I'll take one of
those pink pouches.

106
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:37,801
I feel good today.
My little girl Jada?

107
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:40,434
It's my turn to have her
for Christmas this year.

108
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,173
Two years ago I had her,
and we had the best time.

109
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,680
I've TiVoed her
favorite shows,

110
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:46,283
some things
I've never heard of.

111
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:47,916
iCarly...

112
00:04:48,652 --> 00:04:50,678
You know who's funny
on that show?

113
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,220
The friend with
the video camera.

114
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:55,421
He's got a nice
way of talking.

115
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,559
Hey, it's snowing.

116
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,326
DWIGHT: Oh, my God!

117
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,097
It's the first snowfall
of Christmas.

118
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:09,102
Is that just so magical
for you, little girl?

119
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:10,834
Can you not wait to
have a hot chocolate,

120
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:14,469
and cuddle up with Papa
and tell him about all
your Christmas dreams?

121
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:16,237
It's not even a real snow.

122
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:18,714
Look, it's a dusting.
It's pitiful.

123
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:30,158
Hey, Dwight.

124
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,087
MEREDITH: Yes!

125
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:37,090
Damn it, Jim,
you cannot throw
snowballs in here!

126
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:40,963
Well, it's not a snowball,
'cause it's only a dusting.
Right?

127
00:05:41,037 --> 00:05:43,563
Look at that.
There's a pebble in there.
You could have killed me!

128
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,040
Don't be such a baby.

129
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,804
Yeah,
who's a little girl now?

130
00:05:50,647 --> 00:05:52,081
You apologize to me
right now.

131
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:53,343
You've got something
on your nose.

132
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,112
You apologize right now.

133
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:57,184
No.
Very well,

134
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:59,718
then I challenge you
to a snowball fight

135
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:02,154
on the first
real snow of winter.

136
00:06:04,828 --> 00:06:06,057
You got it.

137
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:08,894
That sounds awesome.
Can we all do it?

138
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:10,695
No, Andy,
it's a snowball fight.

139
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,233
It's not fun.
Go get your own thing.

140
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:13,494
Beat it.

141
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,470
Jim, let go.

142
00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:28,408
Angela, are you bringing
your new boyfriend
to the party?

143
00:06:28,785 --> 00:06:30,378
I wouldn't subject
Robert to that.

144
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:32,445
He's a very busy senator.

145
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:33,785
State senator.

146
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:36,758
I would not expect you
to know what it's like

147
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:38,226
to date someone in
the public arena.

148
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:40,591
Who are you dating
in the public arena?

149
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:43,390
The senator.
Oh, right.

150
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,762
The state senator.

151
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:48,862
We went to a picnic thrown
by the comptroller's wife.

152
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:51,702
Oh.
That would be impressive

153
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:55,143
if anyone knew what
a comptroller was.

154
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:57,708
Well...

155
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,645
Do you have any idea
how many photographers
there are

156
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:02,549
at a ribbon-cutting ceremony?

157
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:05,145
I do. Two.

158
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:09,886
"Angela... Here.
Look here!"

159
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:13,326
Before we kick off the party,
I just want to remind everyone

160
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:15,388
that an office party
is just that...

161
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:16,660
Yeah!
A party.

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,128
It's not an excuse
to get really drunk

163
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:22,331
or confront someone
or have a cathartic experience

164
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:23,737
of any kind.
MICHAEL: Pam?

165
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,331
Pam?
Pam?

166
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:27,874
Wow, there are questions
to that. Okay.

167
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,970
You know what,
no questions.

168
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,643
Last item on the agenda,
Toby would like to
make an announcement.

169
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:38,345
Hi, guys.
Hi.

170
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:40,413
I just wanted to
let you know

171
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,288
that I'll be taking
a leave of absence
starting next week.

172
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,588
Because you've
been on the lam?

173
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:45,889
Because the boring police
have been after you,

174
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:46,952
and they finally
caught up with you?

175
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:48,087
No, the opposite.

176
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:52,363
I was actually selected
to be a juror on a very
high-profile case.

177
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:57,032
Yes, the case of the
horrible red-headed sad sack.

178
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,335
And the verdict, it was Toby.

179
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,277
And the sentence, death.
Death to Toby!

180
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:03,771
DWIGHT: Death to Toby!

181
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:05,839
Okay, that's hurtful talk.
We've talked about that.

182
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:07,645
You know, I don't interrupt
your announcements.

183
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:10,016
You leave these huge pauses
in your sentences.

184
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,145
What do you expect me to do?

185
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,450
What's the case, Toby?

186
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:13,615
Well, I really can't
talk about it,

187
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,885
but it's a very
high-profile case.

188
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,392
Is it criminal?
Yes.

189
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,027
Have we heard of it?
I don't know.

190
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:19,756
Is it the middle school
teacher who tried

191
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:21,730
to turn her foreign exchange
student into a sex slave?

192
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:23,733
Come on.
Was it the post office guy

193
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,166
who rubbed his penis
all over the mail?

194
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,363
Guys,
it's a really big deal.

195
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:29,338
He's rubbing his neck.
He's rubbing his neck!

196
00:08:29,406 --> 00:08:30,499
He's rubbing his neck.

197
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,733
Scranton Strangler!

198
00:08:33,143 --> 00:08:34,941
I can neither
confirm nor deny this.

199
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:38,209
Let's just say
I'll be up to my neck
in jury duty.

200
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:43,848
That was the worst joke ever.

201
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,719
Corporate will be
sending someone else
to take my place.

202
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,315
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.

203
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:50,087
Holly Flax.
She comes from
the Nashua branch.

204
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,458
What? What?
Yeah.

205
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:52,618
She'll be starting next week.

206
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:53,822
If you have any
questions about

207
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:54,956
the transition,
just let me know.

208
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,590
Hold on,
Holly's coming back here?

209
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,362
Yeah.
Guys, who's Holly?

210
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:00,299
MICHAEL: That is a great
question, Erin.

211
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,398
How do you describe somebody
who is at the same time

212
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:07,876
an old friend,
and was a lover.

213
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,811
And was a complicated part
of my past,

214
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:14,817
and maybe, just maybe

215
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:16,409
a part of my future?
Wow.

216
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:17,818
She's one sassy black lady.

217
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:21,187
Holly's coming back,
everybody, and we have to
have a party.

218
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:22,987
I'm not sure
the temporary replacement

219
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:24,721
of an HR rep
really warrants a party.

220
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:27,593
You know what,
we'll postpone this party
until then.

221
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:30,130
This is too important.
Cancel this one.

222
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,226
Dwight, get rid of the tree.
Okay.

223
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:33,768
Cancel. We're canceling it.

224
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:34,827
No, don't throw them out!

225
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:35,961
No, we have to
cancel the party.

226
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,029
We can save that!
No, no, no.

227
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:38,939
We're gonna get
fresh for Holly.
Fresh and new.

228
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:40,237
I know.
These cookies are fine!

229
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,643
It's not. They're not.
Michael, wait.

230
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:43,873
We don't have...

231
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,939
We don't have the budget
for another party.

232
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:47,950
Well, then,
everybody will chip in.
It'll be fine.

233
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,885
I honestly think
you're idealizing people
here again, Michael.

234
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:52,388
I don't think
that's gonna happen.
You know what,

235
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:54,390
I'll pay for it.
I'll pay for the party.
It doesn't matter.

236
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:57,188
This is way too important.
People, Holly's coming back,

237
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:59,626
and this is the most
important Christmas party
of my life.

238
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:01,460
So back to work.

239
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:05,127
Man, I worked hard.
I worked so hard for this!

240
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,003
I was after
corporate constantly.

241
00:10:08,104 --> 00:10:11,097
I emailed Jo.
I wrote letters.

242
00:10:11,174 --> 00:10:15,373
And you know who
I end up owing this to,
is the Scranton Strangler.

243
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:18,904
Thank you. Thank you,
Scranton Strangler.
I love you!

244
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:22,284
You just took one more
person's breath away.

245
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:32,161
MICHAEL: We have always had
good Christmas parties here,
as you know,

246
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:33,992
but they've never been cool.

247
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:37,291
The name is Bond. Santa Bond.

248
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:39,928
I'll have an eggnog,
shaken, not stirred.

249
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:42,469
Classic Brosnan.

250
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,901
Santa. Wonderful tradition.
Everybody loves Santa.

251
00:10:45,975 --> 00:10:48,240
Everybody can't get enough
of the jolly old man.

252
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:50,438
But that is a myth,
because you know what,

253
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:53,244
he is not necessarily
a big fat guy with a beard.

254
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,941
He's not
necessarily an old guy.

255
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:57,783
No one knows what
the real Santa Claus... God!

256
00:10:57,854 --> 00:11:00,483
Could you just stop
moving your calves so much
while you're talking?

257
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:02,287
Well, this year's
gonna be different.
We're gonna have fun.

258
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,224
It's not gonna be tacky.
It's going to be...

259
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:07,389
You know what,
the food is
going to be austere.

260
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:10,196
It is not going to be tacky,
deli platter food.

261
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:12,826
It's not gonna have a big,
fat, gross Santa Claus.

262
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:14,962
It's gonna be a cool,
sleek Santa.

263
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:16,538
Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend.

264
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:17,972
Okay. Sure.
I'll invite him.

265
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,202
I mean,
unless there's any chance

266
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:20,538
there could be press
at this party.

267
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,873
You never know
about the press.

268
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:24,278
Well, I only ask
because he's a senator.

269
00:11:24,347 --> 00:11:25,815
Could he help us with
some parking tickets?

270
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:26,975
I don't think
that's appropriate.

271
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,245
Well,
then he's not a senator.

272
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:29,843
Yes, he is.
Okay.

273
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,217
Hey.
Hey.

274
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:34,552
We still doing
the gifts today?

275
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:36,719
I mean,
it is the Christmas party.

276
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:39,020
Well,
the classy Christmas party.
Yes.

277
00:11:39,128 --> 00:11:41,597
But don't get too excited,
'cause I didn't have
a lot of time this year.

278
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:43,758
Me neither.
Okay.

279
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,860
I've been working
forever on Jim's present.

280
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,600
He always gives me
the best Christmas gifts.

281
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,641
He'll take a memory
or a private joke,

282
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,238
and he'll create
something totally unique.
I love them.

283
00:11:57,313 --> 00:11:59,908
So this year
I made him something.

284
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:02,208
A comic book.

285
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:05,217
It stars Jimmy Halpert,
a mild-mannered paper salesman

286
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:06,756
who, while riding his bike
through the forest,

287
00:12:06,823 --> 00:12:08,951
is bitten by
a radioactive bear

288
00:12:09,025 --> 00:12:12,223
and becomes "Bear Man."
Wreaks havoc on the office.

289
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:13,991
It's really good.

290
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,643
Okay.

291
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:38,253
No, no, no, no!
Fake tree. No!

292
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:40,449
No, it has the little...
Pam, no, no.

293
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:42,014
Holly's coming
from New Hampshire.

294
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,720
Somebody from New Hampshire
looks at that and thinks
it's a burning cross.

295
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:48,287
No, no. I want you to
go and get a real tree.

296
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:50,224
Take some money. Thank you.

297
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,791
Hi, I'm looking
for Michael Scott.

298
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,459
Yes, that's me. Come on in.

299
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,932
There's nothing classier
than boring jazz music,

300
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,409
I am here to tell you.

301
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:03,105
And I made a bit
of a judgment call.

302
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,307
I hired one musician,
because I thought,

303
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:08,044
"What's better,
to hire an entire quartet
for half an hour,

304
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:10,109
"or one bassist
for the entire day?"

305
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:19,288
Hey, any volunteers
to come with me to
go buy a Christmas tree?

306
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:22,025
I would, but I don't
want to get dirty.

307
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:24,062
There might be
girls at the party.

308
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,396
Why do you always
think that girls
are gonna be at the party?

309
00:13:26,469 --> 00:13:29,132
No one invited girls.
It's just us.

310
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:32,665
I will help.
Although my brid, my hybrid,

311
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:35,176
my Prius hybrid,
won't fit a tree.

312
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:38,209
Which is ironic,
considering how
many trees it saves

313
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:40,007
on a daily basis.
KEVIN: Yeah.

314
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:44,076
I do, however, have a hookup
with a dude who has a pickup.

315
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,246
Do you mean Darryl?
That's a great idea.

316
00:13:46,322 --> 00:13:47,483
I'll ask him.
You know Darryl?

317
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:49,685
Yeah. He works here.
We all know him.

318
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,025
I should come along,
just 'cause he's my,
you know, he's my hookup.

319
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:54,153
Cool.

320
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,926
Come on, now, Justine, look.

321
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:59,064
Listen, look, I've been
planning this, okay?

322
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:01,695
You cannot do this, Justine.
I'm not doing it!

323
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:03,603
She told me she wants
to have Christmas here.

324
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:05,005
She did?
Yes.

325
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:07,441
She wants to be around
family for Christmas.

326
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,500
DARRYL: I don't know.

327
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:12,347
I thought I was enough
family for my daughter.

328
00:14:15,151 --> 00:14:16,585
Don't come in, I'm busy.

329
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,187
It's cool, Darryl,
I'm here, too.

330
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,949
Hey, sorry, I really
didn't want to come in.

331
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:21,820
It's just that we have to
go buy a new Christmas tree,

332
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:23,883
and we're hoping
we could borrow your truck.

333
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,353
Uh. No.
Come on, it'll be fun.

334
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:28,557
We could do donuts
in the snow on the way back.

335
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:31,226
No. Thank you for your
interest in my truck.

336
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:34,865
Okay. Sorry.
We'll leave you alone.

337
00:14:36,406 --> 00:14:37,669
Hey.

338
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:41,339
You know what?
I could use
a breath of fresh air.

339
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:43,310
Let's do it.

340
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:49,009
When Holly gets here,
I want you to be
very helpful to her.

341
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,247
I've looked her up online.
There's nothing about her.

342
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,720
She's made no impression
on the Internet.

343
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:54,883
She doesn't need
an Internet presence.
You just know.

344
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:57,885
Hey.

345
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,189
What the hell
are you doing here?

346
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:00,591
You're supposed to
be in the courthouse.

347
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:02,825
We're on recess.
I came for the party.

348
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,526
Hey, everyone.
KEVIN: Hi, Toby.

349
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:06,862
What does the Strangler
look like?

350
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,369
Is he gorgeous?
He looks gorgeous
in the drawings.

351
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:10,532
Yeah.
That scowl.

352
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:13,906
I can't talk about it
or I'll get removed
from the jury.

353
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:16,070
And then he will come back
here and replace Holly,

354
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,738
so stop asking him questions.

355
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:19,908
I know people are only
this excited to talk to me

356
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:21,610
because of the trial.

357
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:24,686
But they talk to me
for a while,

358
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:27,451
and maybe people realize
I have something to say.

359
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:32,661
And then one day,
we're just talking.

360
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,300
You've reached the voice mail
of Dwight Kurt Schrute.

361
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:43,464
Please leave...

362
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:59,153
Stop!

363
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:08,058
I have no feeling
in my fingers or penis.

364
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:10,323
But I think it was worth it.

365
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:19,072
I was laying on the ground,
defenseless,

366
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:23,510
and he just kept throwing them
until he exhausted himself.

367
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:25,774
And, then...

368
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:29,285
"How about icing it?
LOL. Dwight."

369
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,052
Hi.
ERIN: Hello.

370
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,687
Is there any way I can
get a hand with these, please?

371
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:42,329
I'm really sorry,
I can't help you.

372
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:44,367
I'm waiting for my boss's
pretty friend to arrive.

373
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:46,265
MICHAEL: There she is.

374
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:47,897
Hey.

375
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:50,934
Erin, would you help her,
for God's sake?

376
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:54,603
You're Holly!
Of course. Sorry.

377
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,943
Hello.

378
00:16:59,115 --> 00:17:00,777
Well, well, well,

379
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,649
if it isn't Michael Scott.
You old bastard.

380
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:07,418
Well, I never thought
I'd see your face

381
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,686
around these parts,
you old bastard!

382
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,285
Well, I did show my face
around these parts,
you old bastard.

383
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:14,897
Why, you're some
sort of wise guy, huh?

384
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:16,398
I most certainly am.

385
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:17,489
Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk...

386
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,566
D'oh!
Oh, Homey.

387
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:23,401
Okay. Holly's back.

388
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:26,869
Hi. Hi.

389
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:30,376
Oh, huggy monster!

390
00:17:30,446 --> 00:17:32,438
Oh, not the huggy monster!

391
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:34,211
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

392
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,876
I don't want to die!

393
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:40,152
Wow. Well, everybody,

394
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:41,918
you remember Holly.
Hi.

395
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,755
Did you bring us
anything from Nashua?

396
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,361
Oh, yeah.
I brought some maple candy.

397
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:49,228
But I have to admit,
I got a little hungry
on the drive,

398
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:50,357
and I ate some of them.

399
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:51,558
MICHAEL: That's adorable.

400
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:53,296
Would you put those out?
To throw out?

401
00:17:53,369 --> 00:17:55,600
Or put out, like,
six pieces for everyone?

402
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,230
Oh, it's so nice to be back.

403
00:17:57,306 --> 00:17:59,832
It looks beautiful in here.
Super-classy.

404
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:02,001
It's like a party
for limousine drivers.

405
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,980
Well, you came on the day
of our Christmas party.

406
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,448
It's fabulous.
I love what you did!

407
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:08,814
Isn't it wonderful?

408
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:11,080
We love it here.
Don't you love it?

409
00:18:11,153 --> 00:18:13,452
All right, let me show you
to your desk.

410
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,582
I show you to your desk!

411
00:18:15,658 --> 00:18:17,923
HOLLY:
Watch out for my guns.
They're both loaded.

412
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:21,055
What kind of guns
do you have? Six-shooter?

413
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,461
This is weird. I can't
believe you're here.

414
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:26,934
This feels like you
never left. Doesn't it?

415
00:18:27,069 --> 00:18:28,469
Yeah, kind of. Yeah.

416
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,373
Oh, God.
Oh, and you have a Woody.

417
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:38,078
Oh, I love...
A.J. gave me that.

418
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:40,646
Well, that's understandable.
Still raw.

419
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,815
Woody your favorite character?
Mmm-hmm.

420
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,788
You know who my
favorite character
in Toy Story is?

421
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,484
Andy's mom.
Why?

422
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:50,219
Because without Andy's mom,
there's no plot.

423
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,386
And without any plot,
there is no movie.

424
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:54,995
That is a really good point.

425
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:58,091
A.J. said he hadn't seen
any of the Toy Story movies.

426
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,759
You're kidding me.
No. I know.

427
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:01,929
I'm like, "What?
Are you serious?"

428
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,870
What a douche bag!
Get a life!

429
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:06,234
Get a...
Yeah, good riddance.

430
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:09,069
We sat down and we
watched them all in one day.

431
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,171
Now he's the biggest
Toy Story fanatic ever.

432
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,476
Good for him.

433
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:14,312
Next day I found him
in my bed.

434
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:16,750
Really? That's creepy.

435
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:18,253
How did A.J.
get in your house?

436
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:19,889
We live together.

437
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,552
Oh, you do?

438
00:19:22,692 --> 00:19:26,720
He had a little note
pinned to him that said,
"You've got a friend in me."

439
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,270
Yeah,
Randy Newman's the best.
Yeah.

440
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,601
I love him.
Me, too.

441
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:40,971
Christmas tree, Christmas tree

442
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:44,104
Won't you be my
Christmas tree?

443
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,648
Hey, how about this one?

444
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:48,210
Ah! Seems a little
full of itself, right?

445
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:49,308
Kind of a pretty boy.

446
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:52,484
What if we got
a really beat up one,
like on Charlie Brown,

447
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:54,181
and we just loved
it for what it is?

448
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:55,280
Maybe. I mean...

449
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:57,826
No, she be talking
to your mom or something.

450
00:19:57,893 --> 00:19:59,919
This is my
daughter too, Justine!

451
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,130
You seem to think...

452
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:07,561
Pick a damn tree already.

453
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,737
Hey, listen, Darryl,
it's none of my business,

454
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:14,299
but if I couldn't
have Cece for Christmas,
I'd be really upset, too.

455
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:17,642
I don't have kids
or anything,

456
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:21,747
but if my
grandmother ever dies,
I'm going to kill myself.

457
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:24,619
Jada don't want to
spend Christmas with me.

458
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:27,347
She told her mom it
wasn't as much fun.

459
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,220
How could she say that?

460
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:32,227
You know,
I took her to the toy store
to buy her own presents.

461
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,928
Well, Darryl, no kid
wants to buy their own
Christmas presents.

462
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:37,427
Her mom wants me
to take her to mass.

463
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,695
I guess that's
something to do.

464
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:42,205
No, you should have
her mom do the boring
Christmas stuff on her time.

465
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:44,502
You should be associated
with the fun parts
of Christmas.

466
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:46,140
How do I do that?

467
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,968
Bring her to the party.

468
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:50,740
Yeah, we'll have Santa,
and we'll play games with her.

469
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,645
It'll be a lot of fun.
Yes!

470
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:55,547
You'll be Mr. Christmas
by the end of the night.

471
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,779
Hey, guys, the tree's here.
Hey.

472
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:02,322
Nobody hug me.
I'm covered in tree sap, so...

473
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:04,553
Why would someone hug you?

474
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,789
Hey there, Jada.
Nice to see you again.

475
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:09,297
I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.

476
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:10,489
Are you serious?

477
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,701
It's a sophisticated take.

478
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:15,028
He doesn't look
like Santa Claus.

479
00:21:15,204 --> 00:21:16,365
No, he doesn't.

480
00:21:17,273 --> 00:21:19,538
I told her
Santa would be here.

481
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:21,577
Yeah, well, I was told
that Holly would be here,

482
00:21:21,644 --> 00:21:22,839
single and ready to date.

483
00:21:22,912 --> 00:21:23,971
And we all got misled.

484
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:25,172
Who told you that?

485
00:21:25,314 --> 00:21:28,944
Nora Ephron,
in every romantic
comedy ever made.

486
00:21:29,218 --> 00:21:31,278
So is it an open relationship?

487
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,145
Oh, God, no.

488
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:35,518
Well, you're almost 40.
Oh, do you not want kids?

489
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:38,618
Oh, I want kids.
I really want kids.

490
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:40,890
But A.J. and I are
practically engaged.

491
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:43,122
We talk about
spending our lives together.

492
00:21:43,199 --> 00:21:44,258
So where's the ring?

493
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,493
Kelly!

494
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:47,565
How are you
adjusting to the move?

495
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:48,763
Nobody cares about that.

496
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:51,672
Look,
you have to make him commit,
or kick his butt to the curb.

497
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:53,936
You guys,
I don't think any of us

498
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,978
are really qualified
to be giving Holly

499
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:57,673
personal advice
about her love life.

500
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,580
Yeah, I mean,
maybe Holly's not
in any position

501
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:02,743
to be shooing guys away.

502
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:06,488
I don't get it. I'm sorry.

503
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:08,490
I just... I don't get it.

504
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:10,826
Okay, listen,

505
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:15,626
I'm gonna tell him
that if he doesn't propose
by the end of this year,

506
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:16,688
we're over.

507
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,898
Wow, an ultimatum.
Yeah.

508
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,168
It doesn't
really seem like you.

509
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:24,831
That is a great idea.
Ultimatums are key.

510
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:26,773
Basically,
nobody does anything
for me anymore

511
00:22:26,842 --> 00:22:28,538
unless I
threaten to kill myself.

512
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,152
Don't... Stop. Dwight!

513
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:46,723
Dwight, stop!
Oh, no. Oh, no!

514
00:22:46,795 --> 00:22:48,388
Stop!
Oh, no.

515
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:50,762
Yes, taste my wrath!
Okay. Okay...

516
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,062
You like that?
Seriously!

517
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:53,897
Okay. Okay.

518
00:22:57,373 --> 00:23:00,138
Yes, I have a wig
for every single
person in the office.

519
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:06,114
You never know when you're
gonna need to bear a passing
resemblance to someone.

520
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,885
I just want it to stop.

521
00:23:09,752 --> 00:23:11,243
So cool, right?

522
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:13,822
There's no connection
between the origin
story and the quest.

523
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:14,879
Okay.

524
00:23:14,957 --> 00:23:16,448
We need to know
who Jimmy Halpert was

525
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:17,788
before he was
bitten by the bear.

526
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,886
Otherwise it's
the bear's quest.

527
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,597
Okay, well,
I just sort of meant,
like, cute, right?

528
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:23,824
Well,
did you come here for help,

529
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:25,629
or did you come here for me
to tell you how great it is?

530
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:27,496
I mean, help,
if it's something simple,

531
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,697
like add page numbers
or laminate it or...

532
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,401
It sounds like you
know what you want.

533
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:34,807
It's also a little derivative
of a serial called Bear Man.

534
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:35,901
Did you look that up?

535
00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:36,968
No.
Okay.

536
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:40,405
Oh, Jim. Hey.
Hey, Toby.

537
00:23:40,482 --> 00:23:43,884
There's this
female stenographer
at the courthouse...

538
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:45,387
No way.
Who looks exactly like you.

539
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:47,150
That's incredible.
Yeah. No, it's uncanny.

540
00:23:47,222 --> 00:23:49,817
You know what's crazy?
I can't reconnect
with you right now.

541
00:23:49,892 --> 00:23:51,758
Hold on one second.

542
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:57,793
Excuse me.

543
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:15,048
I guess there are
just some people

544
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:17,211
who you stay together with
when you transfer,

545
00:24:17,286 --> 00:24:18,686
and some people you don't.

546
00:24:18,754 --> 00:24:20,245
And that's just the way it is.

547
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:24,922
And I can be
mature about that.

548
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:38,865
It's so cold.
Even with my coat on.

549
00:24:39,074 --> 00:24:41,600
Maybe your senator boyfriend
has a blanket in his car

550
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:43,212
for screwing Americans.

551
00:24:43,312 --> 00:24:46,680
Yet another opportunity
where a blanket
would have come in handy.

552
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:48,450
You guys,
this has to stop.

553
00:24:48,517 --> 00:24:49,883
Someone could have
really gotten hurt.

554
00:24:49,952 --> 00:24:53,252
What if Meredith was taking
her smoking break
below that window?

555
00:24:53,322 --> 00:24:54,790
You know what
would have happened?

556
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:57,019
The shards of glass
would have shaved
her face right off.

557
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:59,286
And, yes,
it might have been funny,

558
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:01,660
but it also would have
been incredibly tragic.

559
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:02,823
I could not agree more.

560
00:25:02,898 --> 00:25:05,697
And I just want to
state for the record that
I am intending to sue Jim

561
00:25:05,768 --> 00:25:07,464
for acute
psychological distress.

562
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:10,529
What are you talking about?
You're the one terrorizing me.

563
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:13,633
With snowballs, Jim?
With fluffy little snowballs?

564
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,471
No. I thought we
were just playing.

565
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:16,603
Dwight's right.

566
00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:19,705
What you did was dangerous
and inappropriate.

567
00:25:19,782 --> 00:25:21,341
I'm really
surprised at you guys.

568
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:23,816
Last time I was here,
you were both best friends.

569
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:30,689
All this arguing reminds me
of a very funny story.

570
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,286
You see this on my desk?

571
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:36,656
You know who gave me this?

572
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,963
My girlfriend Tara,
who lives in New York City.

573
00:25:39,034 --> 00:25:40,297
DWIGHT: Wait,
what girlfriend?

574
00:25:40,436 --> 00:25:41,699
I haven't told you about her.

575
00:25:42,037 --> 00:25:44,871
I find that unlikely.
You email me when
you get a new zit.

576
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,239
I'm a man in my mid-40s
and I still get zits.

577
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:48,777
I think that's
pretty interesting.

578
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:51,609
But you know what,
I am not on trial here,
the Scranton Strangler is.

579
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,512
So anyway,
we have this great weekend,

580
00:25:53,582 --> 00:25:55,244
and she drives
me to the airport,

581
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:59,084
and we get to JFK,
but I'm flying
out of La Guardia.

582
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:00,850
So we laugh and
laugh and laugh,

583
00:26:00,923 --> 00:26:02,186
and then we spend
the rest of the day

584
00:26:02,257 --> 00:26:04,749
walking around slo-mo
drinking latte.

585
00:26:04,827 --> 00:26:07,695
And at the end of the day,
she gives me this,
and she says,

586
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:10,733
"Michael, maybe next time,
you should take a cab."

587
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,599
I didn't know you
had a girlfriend.

588
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:15,570
I do. She is.

589
00:26:15,637 --> 00:26:18,197
Did you see her face?

590
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:22,535
Well, it seems to me
that there is a person
sitting out there in the annex

591
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:25,547
that still has feelings
for Michael G. Scott.

592
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:27,783
And it ain't Tara.

593
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:30,943
So you went
homemade this year.

594
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:32,510
Yep.
Yeah.

595
00:26:33,188 --> 00:26:35,316
Money problems.
Is that what this is about?

596
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:37,955
I mean, oh, dear,
I don't think we
can help you out.

597
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,996
No, no. Jim had
a great year, actually.

598
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,894
I just wanted to
get your opinion.

599
00:26:43,465 --> 00:26:44,831
Are you good at homemade?

600
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:46,124
Look at this.

601
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:48,233
Yeah.

602
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:54,738
Who did this?

603
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:58,110
It's obvious to me
I'm not welcome here,

604
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,775
but somebody better
tell me who did this,
or else I'm leaving.

605
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:03,444
Well, I don't think
Erin seems to like you.

606
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,283
That's not true.

607
00:27:05,354 --> 00:27:07,016
I don't know her enough
to make a decision even.

608
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:08,853
What happened?
What happened?

609
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:10,689
Toby, what did you do?

610
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,789
I think Toby's very jealous
of all the attention
you've been getting.

611
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:16,454
No, I would never ever
do anything like that.

612
00:27:16,532 --> 00:27:18,330
But it does seem like
something you would do.

613
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,198
Oh, really? Turn it on me.

614
00:27:20,435 --> 00:27:22,768
Well, isn't that nice?
Thank you very much.

615
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:24,670
Wait, wait, guys, listen.

616
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:29,907
Toy Story is all about
toys that come to life
when people aren't looking.

617
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:32,848
You don't think...
It's not possible

618
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:36,342
that Woody did
this to himself?

619
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:37,847
MICHAEL: It is Christmas.

620
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,287
No, it really seems like
something Michael would do.

621
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:43,826
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
Well, the fact that
you would think that

622
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:46,657
points to the possibility
that it is probably not me.

623
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:48,190
And that I have been framed.

624
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,491
Why would anyone
frame you for that?

625
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:51,295
Okay, I'm sorry,
why are we discounting

626
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:53,835
this whole
"Woody came to life"
thing so quickly?

627
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:01,440
Surprise!
It was part of the party.

628
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:03,677
Pretty funny, huh?

629
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,212
You think this is funny?

630
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:07,639
I don't.

631
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,186
But someday I think
we will laugh about this.

632
00:28:11,253 --> 00:28:13,188
When we tell our kids...
Yikes.

633
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:16,557
Oh, my God.
All right! Shh!

634
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,725
Okay. You know what,

635
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:21,160
Holly, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

636
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:25,565
An accident borne
of jealous feelings.

637
00:28:26,068 --> 00:28:28,003
Michael,
you have to let this go.

638
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,801
I'm with someone else.
I don't feel that way anymore.

639
00:28:31,006 --> 00:28:32,065
Oh, really?

640
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,200
Well,
you certainly seemed jealous

641
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:36,438
when I told you
about my fake girlfriend.

642
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:37,843
That's what Jim
and Dwight thought.

643
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:40,439
Okay, hey, hey, hey...
No, fake girlfriends
are always wrong.

644
00:28:40,515 --> 00:28:43,508
You made up a fake girlfriend
to see if I'd get jealous?

645
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:45,679
And you destroyed a gift
my boyfriend gave me?

646
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:46,983
What is the matter with you?

647
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:52,758
When you got transferred,
and I drove you up to Nashua,

648
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:56,354
you said,
"Michael, I love you,
but I can't do this."

649
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:59,766
But then, with this other guy,
you don't have any problem

650
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:01,497
with a long-distance
relationship, do you?

651
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:03,803
And you know what,

652
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,102
that is what is
the matter with me.

653
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:12,544
Michael, I'm sorry...
And we did this whole
stupid party for you.

654
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:18,611
No.

655
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,624
You guys,
it wasn't my fault.

656
00:29:25,827 --> 00:29:28,126
Nothing is ever your fault.

657
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:34,228
Just like when you
ate those maple candies
that you brought for us!

658
00:29:39,474 --> 00:29:41,375
I really think
you're better off.

659
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:45,879
Mmm. Erin, would you do me
a favor and find my street
clothes for me, please?

660
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:47,006
Yeah.

661
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:51,785
Is she an amazing cook
or something?

662
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:06,800
"Hey, Pickles,
Merry Christmas.
Open immediately?

663
00:30:07,235 --> 00:30:09,261
"Love, Swiss cheese."

664
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:16,637
Damn it, Dwight!

665
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:19,039
Didn't think your
affectionate nicknames

666
00:30:19,114 --> 00:30:21,447
would be your undoing,
did you, Jim?

667
00:30:21,516 --> 00:30:22,848
Let that be
a lesson to you all.

668
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,819
So do they bring in food,
or do you get to go out?

669
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,256
No, they bring it in.

670
00:30:30,926 --> 00:30:33,020
You lucky son of a bitch.

671
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:35,461
I have been trying
to get on jury duty

672
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,023
every single year
since I was 18 years old.

673
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:43,797
To get to go sit in
an air-conditioned room
downtown, judging people

674
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:45,864
while my lunch is paid for...

675
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:48,877
That is the life.

676
00:30:49,878 --> 00:30:52,040
Daddy, I'm bored.

677
00:30:52,114 --> 00:30:54,481
Can I read my book
in your office?

678
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:56,515
Sure, sweetie.

679
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:04,392
Jada, Darryl,
I'm so glad I found you guys.

680
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:06,995
A Grinch stole the star
from on top of
the Christmas tree

681
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:09,054
and is hiding it in
the warehouse somewhere.

682
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:11,095
You want to go
help me find him?

683
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:20,098
Oh, my goodness.

684
00:31:29,518 --> 00:31:33,580
I am the mean old Grinch.

685
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:38,318
The little girl who wishes
to win back the Christmas star

686
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:43,657
must first succeed
at these challenges.

687
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:47,896
That sounds fun
and Christmasy,
you mean old Grinch.

688
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:50,495
What kind of challenges?

689
00:31:50,572 --> 00:31:53,440
Something like
an obstacle course,
Mr. Grinch?

690
00:31:53,508 --> 00:31:58,845
No. You must answer
topical political questions.

691
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:04,779
How many congressmen
is the state of
Pennsylvania guaranteed?

692
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,921
And what other state
has the equal number?

693
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:10,918
I don't know.

694
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:12,551
Do you know the other state?

695
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:16,358
Maybe the Grinch hid
the Christmas star,

696
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:18,892
and we could ask for clues,

697
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,127
and he'll tell us
if we're hot or cold.

698
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:25,339
The star has been hidden.

699
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:28,433
Is the little girl
hot or cold?

700
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,342
Well, it turns out
she's burning up

701
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:34,713
because the star is
right behind her ear!

702
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,717
And the game's
over seconds later.

703
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:38,845
I'm so glad you could come.

704
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,910
It's nice. I know.

705
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:44,156
Hey, everybody,
this is my boyfriend,
Senator Robert Lipton.

706
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:46,420
Hi.
Senator, it's an honor.

707
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:47,861
I'm Angela's friend Oscar.

708
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:50,530
Oscar. A pleasure.

709
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:54,126
Robert seems great.
He's very handsome,

710
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:56,899
firm handshake, he's gay,
good sense of humor.

711
00:33:07,048 --> 00:33:08,209
Hi.
Hello.

712
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,581
I'm A.J.,
I'm here to see Holly.

713
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:11,948
It's kind of a surprise.

714
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:14,490
I know who you are,
and I think you should go.

715
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:17,488
I bet you didn't even
bring us anything, did you?

716
00:33:17,726 --> 00:33:19,695
Was I supposed to
bring you guys something?

717
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:23,093
What? A.J.!
Surprise.

718
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:24,890
What are you doing here?

719
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:26,491
I wanted to see you.
Oh, my God.

720
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,935
How are you?
Wow! Nice.

721
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:30,836
Oh, God, you look great.

722
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,306
When did you get here?

723
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:35,036
Just now. Just now.
Hey.

724
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:36,839
Hey, Michael.
Good to see you again, A.J.

725
00:33:36,945 --> 00:33:38,573
Welcome.
Pleased to see you.
Thank you.

726
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,343
Good trip down?
Yeah, it was great.

727
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:42,077
Good, good.
Good to see you.

728
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,420
Have fun. Enjoy the party.

729
00:33:45,987 --> 00:33:47,853
I am dead inside.

730
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:53,755
What do you want, baby?
We got some granola,

731
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:55,854
got some cupcakes,
chips, apples, pies.

732
00:33:56,064 --> 00:33:58,329
You have a whole room
of vending machines.

733
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,163
I know. Isn't it something?

734
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,462
I can't decide what I want.

735
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:16,774
Merry Christmas.

736
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:19,049
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

737
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:20,485
A Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

738
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:24,122
A Merry Christmas.

739
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:28,828
Thank you so much.
Merry Christmas.

740
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,626
And Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.

741
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,867
Merry Christmas.

742
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,492
Oh, thank you.

743
00:34:37,872 --> 00:34:39,272
For your feet.

744
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:42,035
It's amazing.

745
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,942
It's so great. Thank you.

746
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:46,877
For me?
Yes.

747
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:48,644
Thank you very much.

748
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:05,927
I don't know if you
guys have had a chance

749
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:08,470
to use the new parking meters
that accept credit cards,

750
00:35:08,536 --> 00:35:11,233
but Robert was instrumental
in that legislation.

751
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:13,806
Wow, that's awesome!

752
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:15,373
A real David
and Goliath story.

753
00:35:15,443 --> 00:35:18,675
I'm just so touched
that she's so interested
in my work.

754
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:20,174
ANGELA: I am.

755
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:22,046
MEREDITH: The real problem
is the teachers' union.

756
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:23,483
Zip it, Meredith.
No.

757
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:25,952
You tell me why my kid is 17
and still can't read.

758
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,647
Hey, who's in charge
of making drinks around here?

759
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:30,621
Is there a bartender?
You are.

760
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:31,886
You make your own drink.

761
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:35,123
I'll make it.
What are you drinking?

762
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:36,824
An F train to Brooklyn.
Extra bitters.

763
00:35:36,998 --> 00:35:38,091
I don't know
how to make that.

764
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:40,567
Okay, well, I'll just
stick with my Mojito.

765
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:43,135
And you know
those annoying
geese at the park?

766
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:45,104
Well, he's helping
eradicate them as well.

767
00:35:45,507 --> 00:35:47,203
I mean, I think
they've really become a pest.

768
00:35:47,275 --> 00:35:48,265
Annoying.
Yes.

769
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,312
I don't think
he's in the ceiling, babe.

770
00:35:57,585 --> 00:36:00,578
Well, I don't think
any of us really know.

771
00:36:02,624 --> 00:36:03,990
All right.

772
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,230
Is it...

773
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,203
Is it pebbles from
that beach in Jamaica?

774
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:21,101
Go easy with the shaking.

775
00:36:27,549 --> 00:36:29,017
Oh, my God.

776
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:33,450
You like it?

777
00:36:36,825 --> 00:36:38,350
I love it.

778
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,691
Yep, I do make
great Christmas gifts.

779
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,222
But I couldn't make that.

780
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,061
All right, my turn.

781
00:36:46,134 --> 00:36:48,467
Oh, it's just... I didn't...

782
00:36:48,536 --> 00:36:50,596
I didn't have a lot of time,
so that's just a place holder.

783
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:52,265
Right. Of course.

784
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,141
"The Adventures
of Jimmy Halpert."

785
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:02,542
Oh, my God.

786
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:05,151
This is awesome!

787
00:37:05,286 --> 00:37:06,618
That's my bike.

788
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:09,148
That's my desk.

789
00:37:09,224 --> 00:37:11,159
And that is my daughter.

790
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:16,661
I mean...

791
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:24,069
I don't like
to talk about it.

792
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,172
Better office policy up there.

793
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:31,407
KEVIN: But it should be
the same policy as us.

794
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:38,047
Okay.

795
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:41,784
Michael, wait.

796
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:44,788
Hey, hey, no, don't run.
You're gonna slip.

797
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:47,189
That's good advice.
Yep.

798
00:37:47,796 --> 00:37:52,359
I read this story
about a woman who slipped
on some black ice,

799
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:55,130
and she hit her head
and went into a coma forever.

800
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:57,834
And then every day,
her husband went

801
00:37:57,906 --> 00:38:00,432
and visited her in
the hospital until she died.

802
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:02,637
That's a sad story.

803
00:38:02,844 --> 00:38:05,279
Yeah, well,
at least he was married.

804
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:07,482
Okay, Michael, slow down.

805
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:08,981
Everything's gonna be okay.

806
00:38:09,284 --> 00:38:11,412
No, it's not. It's not.

807
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:16,154
Oh, man,
I can tell you confidently
that it is not gonna be okay.

808
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:20,354
I shouldn't tell
you this, but...

809
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:24,622
A.J. won't commit to Holly.

810
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:28,594
And she's gonna tell him
that if he doesn't propose
to her

811
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,468
by the end of the year,
it's over.

812
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:32,763
Really?

813
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:33,966
Really.

814
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,947
And I don't know about you,
but I don't know
a lot of happy marriages

815
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:41,244
that start off with
an ultimatum. Do you?

816
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:43,943
No.

817
00:38:44,886 --> 00:38:47,913
So just be patient.

818
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:52,049
Yeah. I mean,
I can wait till then.

819
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:58,997
Come here.
I don't want you to fall.

820
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:01,669
I surrender.

821
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:04,800
I do not accept
your surrender.

822
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,241
There's only one way
that I would ever relent.

823
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,135
Anything. You got it.

824
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:14,844
You hit Pam in the face with
a snowball while I watch.

825
00:39:15,884 --> 00:39:17,147
You're a psychopath.

826
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:18,548
I'll take that as a no.

827
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:21,783
I was in the mall,
and I saw that,

828
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,688
and I thought it had
your name written all over it.

829
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,955
Michael, this is the gift
that corporate gave us
that I picked out.

830
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,020
You're re-gifting this to me.

831
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:31,959
No, that's not...

832
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,971
No, I went to the mall
and I picked that out
especially for you.

833
00:39:36,037 --> 00:39:38,063
Oh, yeah?
Well, show me the receipt.

834
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:42,000
From the mall.

835
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:44,504
That...

836
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,810
This is a fast food
receipt from April.

837
00:39:47,115 --> 00:39:48,208
That...

838
00:39:48,283 --> 00:39:49,979
God, how many number nines
did you order?

839
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:53,748
A.J.: Is everyone here
kind of mean?

840
00:39:54,656 --> 00:39:57,888
I think everyone's
on edge because of
the Strangler trial.

841
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,985
Hey, I'm so glad
you came down.

842
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:02,695
It's been so much
harder than I expected.

843
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,958
Hey, what happened to Woody?

844
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:08,465
Oh, okay, get ready for this.
You're not gonna believe it.

845
00:40:09,037 --> 00:40:12,439
I was making salad,
and he fell right
into the dressing.

846
00:40:12,507 --> 00:40:15,238
I mean,
there was salad
dressing all over him.

847
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,744
He smells awful.

848
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:18,312
It was blue cheese dressing.

849
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:19,809
Great.

850
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:23,751
Hey, Mike.
Hey.

851
00:40:23,818 --> 00:40:26,049
We wanted to
give you something.

852
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,315
Merry Christmas.

853
00:40:27,388 --> 00:40:30,085
Thank you.
A Hostess apple pie!

854
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:32,491
This is my favorite breakfast.
How did you know that?

855
00:40:32,627 --> 00:40:33,720
Thank you very much.

856
00:40:33,962 --> 00:40:35,931
What do you say?
You're welcome.

857
00:40:37,532 --> 00:40:39,467
Oh, you know,
I seem to remember

858
00:40:39,534 --> 00:40:41,230
that Santa promised
that he would listen

859
00:40:41,302 --> 00:40:42,964
to all the gifts you
wanted for Christmas.

860
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:44,061
Didn't he say that?

861
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:45,128
Yeah.

862
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,136
I think I know where he is.

863
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:49,772
A trampoline.
Mmm-hmm.

864
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:51,608
Video games.
Video games.

865
00:40:51,713 --> 00:40:53,807
DSi.
DSi.

866
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:55,510
A horse.

867
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,845
A pool.

868
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,943
Are you sure you
don't want a pony?

869
00:40:59,153 --> 00:41:01,213
You want a real horse?
Yes.

870
00:41:01,289 --> 00:41:04,191
All right. You have
to pick up after them.

871
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:08,160
Hey, sorry. I'm ready.

872
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:10,154
I don't want to go.

873
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:12,826
Oh. Come on, Bear Man.

874
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:15,764
Come on.

875
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,109
Have you ever
seen them do that?

876
00:41:35,456 --> 00:41:37,220
I'm sorry.

877
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:38,554
I had no idea.

878
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,288
No, it's okay.

879
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:43,698
Okay.
Oh, my God.

880
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:45,595
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.

881
00:41:55,343 --> 00:41:56,641
Okay, this is it.
What?

882
00:41:56,711 --> 00:41:58,304
Go! Go! Go!
What? What is it? What?

883
00:41:58,379 --> 00:41:59,642
Oh, my God!

884
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:05,576
Honey? Jim?

885
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,951
Jim!

886
00:42:17,765 --> 00:42:21,327
In the end,
the greatest snowball
isn't a snowball at all.

887
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:22,998
It's fear.

888
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:25,706
Merry Christmas.
