1
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:10,925
DWIGHT: I have the best
stocked survival shelter
in northeastern Pennsylvania.

2
00:00:10,998 --> 00:00:12,091
But everything
has a shelf life.

3
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:16,102
So I must eat and
then replace everything
that's about to expire.

4
00:00:16,169 --> 00:00:18,070
It's nice not to
have to plan my meals.

5
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:20,801
You're eating
eight-year-old tomatoes.

6
00:00:20,874 --> 00:00:22,035
They're still good
for another week.

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,771
You know, I think I
might have some type
of cheese

8
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,437
in the back of my
fridge you might like.

9
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:27,845
I've got some cheese
you might like, too.

10
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:29,811
In between my toes.

11
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:33,180
DWIGHT: Hardy-har-har.
All right, picture this.

12
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:35,683
Snowy ash drizzles
from the sky.

13
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,015
A rabid pack of
dogs surrounds you

14
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:40,184
as the flame at the end
of your stick dies out.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,128
There's only one
hope left for you,
the door to my shelter.

16
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:46,291
You pound. You beg.
"Dwight, please let me in."

17
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:48,995
But I ignore your cries
and do not let you in.
You want to know why?

18
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:51,470
Because of the sign
that says, "No pounding.
No begging."

19
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:53,598
No, because you
laughed at me.

20
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:56,439
Kevin will be eaten.
Pam will be taken slave.

21
00:00:57,044 --> 00:01:00,344
Jim will be made
a warlord's jester.
Meredith will do okay.

22
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:03,544
Be assured this day
will come. It's just
a matter of time.

23
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:05,415
Could be one month,
could be two months.

24
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:07,718
Three months.
Could be.

25
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:09,521
Four months.

26
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:11,682
I see that happening, yes.

27
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,124
Eight months?

28
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:15,222
That's a realistic timeline.

29
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:18,998
Eleven months.

30
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:20,125
Perhaps.

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,796
Okay, wait,
now really think hard
about this one.

32
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,133
One year.

33
00:01:26,673 --> 00:01:28,699
I could see that as
a very real possibility.

34
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:30,308
Four hundred and
ninety-four months.

35
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:32,577
I could see that happening.

36
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:35,810
Four hundred and
ninety-five months.
That's just...

37
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:59,938
I really
thought I was becoming
too much of a womanizer.

38
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,101
I realized I had shirts
in five different
women's houses.

39
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:04,572
Still not seeing
the problem there.

40
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:05,635
All right.

41
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:08,807
Truth is,
I got a couple love
bumps on my ding-dong,

42
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:10,874
so I was like,
"Game over."

43
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:14,881
MICHAEL: It was the best
of times. It was the
"awesomest" of times.

44
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:17,356
And now Packer
wants to come home.

45
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:20,859
And look who's here
to sign off on it.

46
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,418
My boo, Holly.

47
00:02:23,563 --> 00:02:25,191
Hi.
Hi.

48
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:27,792
You must be Todd.

49
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:29,302
Whoa, I'm sorry.

50
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,031
Michael, I thought
we were meeting
Holly today,

51
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:32,197
not Jennifer Aniston.

52
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:34,966
Very funny.

53
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:36,840
Okay, let's get started.
After you.

54
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,071
Okay.

55
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:43,116
Michael,
this'll be just us.

56
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:44,583
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

57
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:48,317
Just so you know,
he's at his funniest

58
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:49,913
when you've given him,
like, five shots.

59
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,014
Okay.

60
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:52,320
And it also helps if
you've had five shots.

61
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:53,917
I already have.

62
00:02:58,532 --> 00:02:59,761
Why is Packer back?

63
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,926
Is Packer here?

64
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,264
Why is he
talking to Holly?

65
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:03,564
Don't know, don't care.

66
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:07,438
Michael loves you,
and your sales speak
for themselves. So...

67
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:13,112
Yes! The Pack is back.

68
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,445
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like
to introduce you

69
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:16,915
to a man who
needs no introduction,

70
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:19,714
probably because
most of you have
done it with him.

71
00:03:19,786 --> 00:03:21,914
Just kidding. He wouldn't
be interested in any of you.

72
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:23,354
In all seriousness,

73
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:27,326
Todd Packer is
a permanent salesman
at this branch.

74
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:30,558
And I would like to
invite you now to welcome
him with open arms.

75
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:32,063
Yes!
What?

76
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,097
It's great to
be among friends.

77
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:38,400
And until then,
you suckers will do.

78
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:39,804
Nice.

79
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,774
We got burned.
MICHAEL: You did.

80
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:44,135
You got burned,
because Packer's back.

81
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:47,579
Packer is turning in
his car for a desk.

82
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:51,812
He is turning in
his condoms for
a condominium,

83
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:54,480
although he's probably
going to have to use
condoms from here on out.

84
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:56,113
Holly. You approved this?

85
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:57,213
Yes, I did.

86
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,816
I think Todd's gonna
make a great addition
to the staff.

87
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:01,691
You did approve it?
Yeah.

88
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:04,789
What don't you understand
about the word "approved"?

89
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:06,925
It seems a couple
of you don't know

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,992
what the word
"approved" means.

91
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,704
I have very little
patience for stupidity.

92
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,639
Sorry we're late.
Gabe fell in the shower.

93
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:16,904
Such a klutz.

94
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:19,879
Yeah, and it took
the fire department
forever to get there.

95
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:22,472
Oh, my God.
Where did this
come from?

96
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:24,751
Who did this?

97
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:26,116
PAM: I got Erin
a new computer

98
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:28,178
because the one at
reception sucked.

99
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:29,780
I should know.

100
00:04:29,856 --> 00:04:31,722
And I don't want to say
the other one was old,

101
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,728
but its IP number was one.

102
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:37,990
Right?

103
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:39,088
Thank you, Pam.

104
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,657
Oh, you're welcome.

105
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:41,758
My pleasure.

106
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:51,301
Can I do something for you?

107
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,506
I just helped someone out.
It feels good.

108
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,843
Nice.

109
00:04:55,048 --> 00:04:57,347
You know, I cleaned
up our daughter for,

110
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,908
like, an hour at 4:00 a.m.
this morning, so...

111
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:00,450
So you know the feeling.

112
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:04,056
Special delivery for
Dwight K. Schrute.

113
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:05,285
I didn't order anything.

114
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:06,587
And I don't have
anything for you,

115
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,788
but I do want to talk
to you about something.

116
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:10,888
We have been
thinking about where
Packer should sit,

117
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:13,399
and we can't just
sit around waiting
for Creed to die.

118
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:15,725
Well, there's a lot
of seats in the annex.

119
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:17,862
So you wouldn't mind
permanently relocating

120
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:19,997
so that Packer can
take this desk here.

121
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,432
TODD: Thanks, man.
It would mean a lot to me.

122
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:25,175
I've been sitting here
for 10 years, Michael.

123
00:05:25,278 --> 00:05:27,338
Well, I was there
for 12 years.

124
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,042
Plus, my name's
carved under the desk.

125
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:30,946
No, it is not.
It is too.

126
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:32,349
Where? Let me see this.

127
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,853
Right there.

128
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,081
Check it out.

129
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,021
DWIGHT: Michael, I don't
want to move desks.

130
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,114
MICHAEL: Don't be
a baby. We're...

131
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:39,523
Okay, there it is.

132
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:41,255
"Packer was here
and so was your mom."

133
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:42,318
Yeah.

134
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:43,385
Do I have any say in this?

135
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,431
MICHAEL: No!
No!

136
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:46,966
It's $20 to watch, Halpert.

137
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:51,465
Hey. Whose
dirt box is this?

138
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:52,934
That's our Zen garden.

139
00:05:53,006 --> 00:05:55,532
What do you
growing here, bull crap?

140
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,206
Hey, Holly.

141
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:02,805
Hey. What's up, guys?

142
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:04,317
Don't "what's up" us.

143
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,821
You think you're
so cute with your
pretty blond hair.

144
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:11,457
Pull it back.
Why did you hire
Todd Packer?

145
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,117
PAM: He's seriously awful.

146
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:15,219
Michael's recommendation
was glowing.

147
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,797
And honestly,
he's been nothing
but nice to me.

148
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:20,698
That's how he gets you
to take off your panties.

149
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:21,928
Why are you nodding?

150
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,470
United front.

151
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:26,263
Okay, look,
we can't fire someone
because we don't like him.

152
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,807
Right. This isn't the
U.S. government.

153
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:30,275
What are you referencing?

154
00:06:30,343 --> 00:06:32,312
Everything.
Everything.

155
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,713
Do any of you have
any concrete complaints
about something he's done?

156
00:06:35,782 --> 00:06:37,114
Well, I mean,
he humped Michael.

157
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:40,585
Well, if that's the case,
I guess I've got
to be fired, too.

158
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:44,622
Hey. Hey, you guys.

159
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:46,819
The Yarmouth
Regatta video is up.
Gather round. Check it out.

160
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,325
This guy's on
a full beam reach.

161
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:51,695
They're hiking out
like mad.

162
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:53,290
Luff him up. Luff him up.

163
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:55,460
Nice!

164
00:06:57,837 --> 00:06:59,396
This computer's
a hunk of junk.

165
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:02,306
Hey, sailor,
come watch your
regatta over here.

166
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:03,703
Where did you get this?

167
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,439
Pam gave it to me.

168
00:07:07,347 --> 00:07:08,679
This is a sick computer.

169
00:07:09,082 --> 00:07:10,573
Gwen Stefani
has this computer.

170
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:13,918
Pamela.
Yep?

171
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:18,186
What does a guy
have to do to whom
to get one of them?

172
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:19,954
You have a computer, Andy.

173
00:07:20,026 --> 00:07:21,722
Yeah, but if you
donated my computer
to Africa,

174
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,629
it would become famous
as the slowest computer
in Africa.

175
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:27,532
Okay, listen,
we just don't have
the budget for it, okay?

176
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,796
Reception needed
a computer, so we got one.

177
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:32,065
Well, Andy's desk
needs a computer.

178
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:35,369
And, I mean, it's just
kind of a coincidence
that I work there, but...

179
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,604
Yes, but reception
is a one-person department.

180
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:40,806
If I get you a new computer,
I have to get one
for everyone in sales,

181
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,213
for Dwight, for Stanley.
It would be crazy.

182
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:47,049
So something good
happening to Stanley
is crazy now.

183
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,315
ANDY: They're not
asking for one.

184
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:49,515
I am. I need it.

185
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:52,184
If you're just
handing them out,
I want one, too.

186
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:54,187
Phyllis, nobody's
handing anything out.

187
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:55,989
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

188
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,826
What, are you gonna
play mahjongg faster?

189
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:59,624
PAM: I'm sorry, Andy.

190
00:08:04,771 --> 00:08:06,569
Hey, what's going on,
you guys?

191
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,629
Yeah.

192
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:08,697
Three muske-queers.

193
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:11,138
Mean, but good.

194
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:14,304
So, Todd, this must
be nice for you,
getting off the road.

195
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,009
You get to spend some time
with your daughter.

196
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:17,550
I don't know.

197
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:20,052
I love her and all,
but she's turned
into a bitch.

198
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,985
Most days she's great,
but some days she
acts like her mom.

199
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,024
Well, some girls
go through a phase.

200
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:27,492
Yeah. Your life
is so insane.

201
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:29,486
You should write a book.

202
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:30,962
Since when did you
learn how to read?

203
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:33,226
I do know
how to read, though.

204
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,133
Yeah. You know
how to read a menu.

205
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,167
This guy...

206
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:46,543
I... He's right.
I mean, I could
lose some weight.

207
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,747
Kevin, in sumo culture,

208
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,614
you'd be considered
a promising up-and-comer.

209
00:08:57,524 --> 00:09:01,017
What the heck?
Why do you have
Erin's computer?

210
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:02,153
It's crazy, right?

211
00:09:02,662 --> 00:09:04,756
Erin just
wanted me to have it,
so we switched.

212
00:09:04,964 --> 00:09:07,263
What? Erin,
is that true?

213
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,564
I just thought he seemed
to really need a new computer,

214
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:10,797
and he knows so
much about that one.

215
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:14,773
Erin, it's not up to you.
This computer was
for reception, okay?

216
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:16,366
It's not yours
to give away.

217
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:19,739
Pam.

218
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:22,908
When I'm freaking out,
I just sort of step back,

219
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:25,076
take three deep breaths.
I'm not freaking out. Okay?

220
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:26,779
And then I ask myself,

221
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:30,220
"Is this worth
freaking out about?"

222
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,021
Andy, why should she
have your crappy computer?

223
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,559
That's interesting.

224
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:36,596
So you also think
my computer's crappy.

225
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,393
Switch the computers
back, Andy.

226
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:42,465
Seriously?
Seriously.

227
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:44,561
Pam, come on.

228
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:46,367
PAM: Now, please.
ANDY: Fine!

229
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,375
Please make sure
nobody is humping me.

230
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:53,138
If you're going
back to the annex,

231
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,406
could you take
these to Dwight?

232
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,277
I think the ants
are waking up.

233
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:57,544
They need to
start farming soon.

234
00:09:58,318 --> 00:09:59,650
Thanks.

235
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,688
Best day ever.
Best day ever.

236
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:04,617
So much is happening.

237
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:07,984
Question.
Should I get stripes shaved
into the side of my head?

238
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:09,393
No. No.

239
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:10,521
Please.

240
00:10:10,597 --> 00:10:12,395
Did Todd tell you
to do that?
Yes.

241
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:14,263
Yeah, I thought so.
You love him, right?

242
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:16,669
You love him. I can tell.

243
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:18,568
I love you.
No, no, not me.

244
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:19,833
Him. What...

245
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:21,397
He's certainly opinionated.

246
00:10:21,474 --> 00:10:22,635
If you're not gonna
take the ants over,

247
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,541
I should probably
just do it myself.
I'm going.

248
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:29,743
No. Are you jealous of him
because you think
he's funnier than you?

249
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:31,473
Honey.

250
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,541
I don't think
he's funnier than me.

251
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:33,780
He's funnier than me.

252
00:10:34,954 --> 00:10:36,286
He's not funny at all.

253
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,382
So I'm less funny
than not funny at all?

254
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,859
Hey, oh-oh, I think the ants
are starting to eat
each other.

255
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:45,695
No, what I'm saying is
he's not funny, but
you're funnier than he is.

256
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:49,498
Okay, Bill Cosby,
Steve Martin,

257
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:51,465
Charlie Bit My Finger,

258
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:54,474
Michael Scott,
then all the way down here,

259
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,437
Todd Packer.

260
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:58,536
That's insane.

261
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:00,876
Honey, he's a jerk.

262
00:11:00,947 --> 00:11:03,974
For Pete's sake,
it just needs to be done.

263
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:10,914
So you two are
married now, right?

264
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,185
Yeah.

265
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:14,284
That's sweet.
How's the sex?

266
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,325
Yeah.
DWIGHT: Hey, Packer,

267
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:18,990
I made you some
hot chocolate.

268
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,089
Why?

269
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,964
'Cause I want to let
bygones be bygones,

270
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:23,128
show you I'm cool.

271
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:25,229
You're the new guy.
It's cold out.
I made too much.

272
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:27,331
I got this awesome
hot chocolate recipe
from my wife.

273
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,171
That's a lot of reasons.

274
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:30,403
Drink it.

275
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,569
I think I'll pass.

276
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:34,776
The only hot
chocolate I'm into
is Vivica A. Fox.

277
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:35,971
Can I talk to
you for a second?

278
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:37,483
Here.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

279
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,984
So this hot chocolate
thing with Packer...

280
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:40,418
None of your business.

281
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:42,887
Well, you know you
can't actually poison him.
Right?

282
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:44,988
It isn't poison.
It's a laxative.

283
00:11:45,058 --> 00:11:46,424
People take laxatives
all the time.

284
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:49,826
This is just a lot
more of a laxative.
Let me handle it.

285
00:11:50,964 --> 00:11:52,694
I really think we
should join forces
on this one.

286
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:53,994
Really?
What do we think?

287
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,695
What would drive him crazy?

288
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:57,997
I know.
Here we go.

289
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:00,837
Pepto-Bismol in
his hot chocolate.

290
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,239
You have got to stop

291
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:03,742
with the hot chocolate stuff.

292
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,834
Okay.

293
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,277
I was thinking
maybe we could
jam his drawers

294
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,047
so they only
come out two inches.

295
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:10,015
Then, that way,
you can see
everything in them,

296
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,142
but you can't get at it.

297
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:15,416
Does Edgar Allan Poe
know about that one?
So sinister.

298
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:17,013
That wouldn't
annoy a person at all.

299
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,581
Where do you come
up with this stuff?

300
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:21,628
Okay. All right,
well, this isn't my best,
but call Froggy 101,

301
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:23,996
say that we're
the tour manager
for Justin Bieber,

302
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:25,190
and we're giving
away free tickets.

303
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:27,825
We give them a number
to call for the tickets,
and it's his number.

304
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,198
Who is Justice Beaver?

305
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,600
He... It's a
crime-fighting beaver.

306
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,972
Why don't you write
up your best 40 ideas

307
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,408
and e-mail them to me.
Can you do that?

308
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:38,536
Absolutely.
I'll e-mail you 100.

309
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:39,601
Okay.

310
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,480
Yeah. Write up
your list of 100, edit it
down to your top 40,

311
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:44,744
and I'll read it over.

312
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,217
Pam, can I talk
to you in private?

313
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:48,653
I don't know if there's
really a private place
in this office.

314
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:50,451
Well, I put a sign-up sheet
in the conference room,

315
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:52,389
and I signed us
up for three mods.

316
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,917
A mod is five minutes,
and it started two
minutes ago, so...

317
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:57,622
You did that?
Can we talk about
this in the meeting?

318
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,131
'Cause we're already late.
Okay.

319
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,725
Wow, when did
people sign up for that?

320
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,790
Mind if I close the door?

321
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,063
No.

322
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:06,129
What you did out there earlier
was totally un-cool.

323
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,800
Well,
what I was supposed to do,
let you walk all over me?

324
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,867
You humiliated me in
front of everybody.

325
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:14,507
Okay, well, I didn't
think about it like that.

326
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,481
It's just...
I can't do anything about it.

327
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,882
I can't replace your computer
unless that one breaks.

328
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:21,250
Well, I mean,
it's pretty broken already.

329
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:24,155
Well, if it breaks
all the way,

330
00:13:24,223 --> 00:13:25,350
I can get you a new one.

331
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:30,189
Pretty sneaky, sis.

332
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:37,300
Hey, cats, we got
a jam session in
mods six, nine and 12.

333
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:42,607
There are 400 of these.

334
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:44,371
Yeah, I couldn't cut it down.

335
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:45,639
They're all good.

336
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:49,779
So good.
"Number three, eat a frog."
That sounds promising.

337
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:51,578
"Number four, eat a dog."

338
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:54,447
I don't know, from
a practical standpoint...

339
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,580
One thirty-five.
Did you like
one thirty-five?

340
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,525
"Eat a brog."
Maybe it's 'cause I
didn't understand it.

341
00:14:01,828 --> 00:14:05,265
I just had a couple of notes.
Let me grab a pen and...

342
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:07,027
Damn it.

343
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:12,470
Just when we were...
Just when we were
getting going.

344
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:27,914
Allow all cookies?
Why, soitenly.

345
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:30,019
Pop-ups? Yes, please.

346
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:33,850
Bit torrent streaming
from a Somalian music website?

347
00:14:33,926 --> 00:14:35,417
Yeah, why not?

348
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:39,694
I hope you don't get sick,
Mr. Computer.

349
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:42,565
Why are you doing
this to me, Andy?

350
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:44,866
Because I hate
your broke ass.

351
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:47,967
And a 76ers fan to boot.
I like that.

352
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,668
And you made Hank smile.

353
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:52,143
That doesn't happen often.
You're very charming.

354
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:55,382
You know what?
That is something that
you should take upstairs

355
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,679
and use on the people
that really matter.

356
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:00,549
Why?
I don't know.

357
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,847
Holly mentioned
that there were
some complaints

358
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:06,085
and that you had
said some things
about Kevin.

359
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,991
Holly said that?
Yeah.

360
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,029
She was laughing hysterically
the whole time.

361
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:12,065
I guess you said
something weird
about your daughter.

362
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:15,101
She asked me, Michael.
It would have been
rude not to answer.

363
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:17,034
You've been on
the road a long time.

364
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,129
And you've been
an outdoor cat.

365
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:21,071
And now you have
to be an indoor cat,

366
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,339
so you can't be peeing
all over the walls.

367
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:26,101
Michael, can I open
the kimono with you?

368
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:29,106
I've been on
the road too long.

369
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:32,352
But I want to connect
with my daughter.

370
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,580
And it's not right
to call her a bitch
in front of strangers.

371
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:36,316
No, it isn't.

372
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:38,591
You're right. I got to...
I got to watch my behavior.

373
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:39,785
Yeah, a little bit.

374
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:42,789
Don't give up on me.

375
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:46,827
I won't.

376
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,693
Okay. Everybody?
I need you to see this,

377
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,932
because maybe
there is somebody here

378
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,770
that you underestimated
who will surprise you.

379
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:58,175
Todd Packer is
going to apologize.

380
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:00,143
Kevin, front and center.
Come here.

381
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:03,478
I got a lot of numbers
here to put together.

382
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:06,041
Kevin, we know
that you are just
trying to save face.

383
00:16:06,118 --> 00:16:08,246
We know that you are
hurt and embarrassed.

384
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:09,812
That's silly.

385
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:12,187
I should be
apologizing to Packer,

386
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:16,320
'cause everybody
knows that I can dish it
as good as I can take it.

387
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:20,025
Okay, sweetie, no,
you shouldn't be
apologizing to Packer.

388
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:21,465
That doesn't
make any sense.

389
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:23,628
You ready for this?
Are you ready for this?
Mmm-hmm.

390
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:25,672
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

391
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:29,868
I'm sorry if you were offended
by my comments earlier.

392
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:31,877
Well, like I said,
I wasn't offended,

393
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:33,936
but I'll stand here
for the big show.

394
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:36,380
Kevin, do you
accept the apology?

395
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:38,577
Don't do it, Kevin.
That's that fake
kind of apology.

396
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:39,983
Okay, go back to the annex.

397
00:16:40,052 --> 00:16:42,578
This is textbook.
It's so un-cool.

398
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,624
Ryan does this to
me all the time,

399
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,591
like it's some offense
to have feelings.

400
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:47,718
Don't do it, Kevin.

401
00:16:47,793 --> 00:16:48,817
Sometimes you overreact.

402
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,295
OSCAR: Michael, how is
this supposed to work?

403
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:52,331
Packer's gonna keep
saying terrible things,

404
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:54,492
and then he's just gonna
make half-ass apologies,

405
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:55,762
and we're back
to square one.

406
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:58,066
Okay. You want an apology?
Here goes.

407
00:16:58,604 --> 00:17:00,402
Kevin, I am so sorry.

408
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:03,443
You are skinny,
and you're a genius.

409
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:06,240
Okay. That...
That was maybe too much.

410
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:10,015
Packer is a survivor
of divorce, Stanley.

411
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:13,382
Packer doesn't speak
with his child, Meredith.

412
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:16,945
Packer never lived up
to his parents'
expectations, Andy.

413
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,189
Angela loves pussycats.
Packer loves...

414
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,284
No, don't.

415
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:23,954
I was going to say "dogs!"

416
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,931
Okay, you know what?
This is over.

417
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:28,593
Apology has been issued,
and we're through with it.

418
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:32,935
Packer's going to be here
until the day he dies,
just like the rest of us.

419
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:37,372
So, listen, we have to
really scuff this up.

420
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,969
No, no, no, we can say
that the previous owner
was a neat freak

421
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:43,141
or an elegant old lady,
and she just kept it around

422
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:45,241
in case her grandkids
came to visit.

423
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:48,686
But they died,
and they never came.
I'm gonna make myself cry.

424
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,851
Andy, this is the
deal we made.

425
00:17:51,357 --> 00:17:52,552
That's probably good.
That's enough.

426
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,116
We should break
this hinge maybe.

427
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,661
Let's not go crazy.

428
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:56,855
Well, thanks. Will do.

429
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:59,194
JIM: Absolutely. Now,
when you get down there,

430
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:01,393
Jo's a little bit forgetful,

431
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,459
so she may have
locked the gate,

432
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:05,505
but what you're gonna
do is, go ahead, hop it,

433
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:07,199
and just head
back to the pool.

434
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:08,502
That sounds weird.

435
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:10,736
JIM: It is weird.
Look at you. Perceptive.

436
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,780
Now I know why Jo's
kept her eye on you.

437
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:15,474
And you make sure
to get down there

438
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,141
and check out
the Harry Potter World.

439
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:19,811
JIM: Whatever you want to
do in your spare time
is up to you.

440
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:22,650
Harry Potter World
is supposed to be fantastic.

441
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:24,213
Apparently, as soon
as corporate found out

442
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,156
I wanted to come
in off the road,

443
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,990
Jo offered me a cushy
new job in Tallahassee.

444
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:30,461
And here's the best part.

445
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:33,089
I'm a huge alligator nerd.

446
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:37,193
I can name you every genus,
every subspecies.

447
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:39,067
Also, I'm a huge boob nerd.

448
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:41,606
Check it out
and have a free
Butterbeer on us.

449
00:18:41,674 --> 00:18:43,199
Keep the receipt,
and we'll get you back.

450
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:44,743
What are you doing?

451
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,834
This is a very
important client.

452
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:47,174
All right,
so just pack your bags.

453
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:49,306
And be sure to bring
those swimming trunks.

454
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:50,577
Bye, now.
Bye.

455
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:54,275
I cannot believe this.
You're sending
Packer to Florida? Why?

456
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:55,614
Because he's a jerk.
You gave him my desk.

457
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:59,024
Okay. So you're
tricking him into
flying to Florida.

458
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,390
This wasn't my first choice.
Jim had so many better ideas.

459
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,486
You have to tell him.
You have to tell him
what you did.

460
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:06,157
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That is not in the plan.

461
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:07,825
That is actually
anti what we're doing.

462
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,902
He is my oldest friend.
I am going to tell him.

463
00:19:10,002 --> 00:19:12,471
Wait. Why don't we
come up with a plan
that we're all happy about?

464
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:13,836
Yeah, that...

465
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:17,104
Pam, how is this
thing even any better
than my old computer?

466
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:20,010
Come on, Andy.
I mean, you said
you wanted a computer.

467
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,445
This is the best I could do.

468
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:22,982
Where'd you even
find this thing?

469
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,483
Like, in the corner
of the warehouse?

470
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,951
Yes, I found it on
a shelf in the corner
of the warehouse.

471
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:30,956
All right, well, thank you
for my garbage computer.

472
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,790
You're looking at
the new face of corporate.

473
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:43,392
Gonna put the "ass"
in Tallahassee.

474
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:44,732
Yes, about that...

475
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,739
Man, we got to go out
and celebrate tonight.

476
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:48,440
Well, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

477
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:50,573
The old ball and chain?

478
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,407
No. No. Nothing
like that at all.

479
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:54,037
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you something

480
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:56,514
that none of these
people have the stones
to tell you.

481
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:58,016
It's your girlfriend.

482
00:19:58,684 --> 00:19:59,947
She's uptight.

483
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:01,979
Sorry?

484
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:03,352
I know this stuff can hurt,

485
00:20:03,422 --> 00:20:05,914
but I wish someone
had said something
to me about my ex-wife.

486
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:08,893
All I'm saying is,
in about a month or so,
have you down to Florida,

487
00:20:08,961 --> 00:20:12,261
introduce you to
all the local talent.

488
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:17,093
Sounds great.

489
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:18,296
Yeah.
It's gonna be so good.

490
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,895
MICHAEL: That is.
It's gonna be awesome.

491
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:23,238
I think you're really going
to enjoy it down there.

492
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:28,312
I'm sorry
about your friend.

493
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,246
No. He's an ass.

494
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:32,410
You are.

495
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,583
You are.

496
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:38,619
What are you,
wicked smaht?

497
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:41,325
No, you are.

498
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,122
Hoo-ah!

499
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,362
Hoo-ah!

500
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:54,196
Saw Andy's new
computer you found
in the warehouse.

501
00:20:54,273 --> 00:20:55,536
Yep. Lucked out.

502
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:56,632
Yeah, you really did,

503
00:20:56,709 --> 00:20:59,611
'cause I know every
inch of that warehouse.

504
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:01,814
Yep. Super lucky.

505
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:03,109
Maybe you could
go back down there

506
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:05,651
and see if you can find
me some extra sick days.

507
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,718
Yeah.

508
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:18,361
You know what?
I think I saw
one sick day.

509
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:21,832
I think maybe I saw five.

510
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:22,960
Three.

511
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:28,703
I'm full-on corrupt.
