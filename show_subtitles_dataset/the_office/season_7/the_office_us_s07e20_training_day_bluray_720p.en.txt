1
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:03,504
MICHAEL:
Kahlua sombrero, please.

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:04,872
All right.
So just you tonight?

3
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:08,103
Actually,
I'm meeting somebody,
but I'm a little bit early.

4
00:00:08,745 --> 00:00:11,977
Leaving my company
after 19 years.

5
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:13,443
I'll drink to that.

6
00:00:14,485 --> 00:00:15,885
I'm starting at
a company this week.

7
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:17,285
Oh, really?

8
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:18,749
To beginnings and endings.

9
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:22,987
And to middles.
The unsung heroes.
And to moms.

10
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,586
The moms of the troops.

11
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:25,820
Mmm.

12
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:28,763
Do not tell my fiancÃ©e
I'm drinking on a Wednesday.

13
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,494
I won't.

14
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:32,397
I don't know her.

15
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:33,562
Moving out to the 'burbs.

16
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:36,106
Actually, I'm moving
further than the 'burbs.
Moving to Colorado.

17
00:00:36,173 --> 00:00:37,197
Colorado?
Yeah.

18
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:38,833
Sunshine State.
Yep.

19
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:39,933
Don't mess with Colorado.

20
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,000
No, don't.

21
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:42,504
Doing some skiing?

22
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,707
No, no.
I don't want to end up
like Sonny Bobo.

23
00:00:45,082 --> 00:00:48,018
Well, that's just good
sense right there, yeah.

24
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:50,645
Everyone I know
who skis is dead.

25
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:54,081
You know what?
I would like to
try the luge, though.

26
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:56,217
Try it once, you're hooked.

27
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:58,159
That's my guess.
That's what I've heard.

28
00:00:58,228 --> 00:00:59,457
I'm an Olympics nut.

29
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,658
Oh, yeah? Me, too.
Summer or winter?

30
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,067
Summer.
Summer.

31
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,326
Knuckle. Actually,

32
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,568
I've got to come
around and give you...
Yeah, come on.

33
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:11,404
You know, it's funny.
I actually tried

34
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:13,569
to get an animal
Olympics going.

35
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:15,112
Really? What happened?

36
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:17,815
You know, life happened.

37
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:20,012
What are you gonna miss
most about Scranton?

38
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:24,282
Oh. Wow. The mountains,
where things are.
Mmm-hmm.

39
00:01:25,556 --> 00:01:26,854
That's the way it goes.

40
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:29,290
Man, he is late.

41
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,793
I'm gonna call him.
Do you mind? I'm sorry.

42
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:32,261
No, no.

43
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,991
Where is this guy?

44
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:39,233
Excuse me.

45
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:43,436
Hello?
This is Michael Scott.

46
00:01:43,507 --> 00:01:45,169
Yes, yes.
Hi.

47
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,301
You running late?

48
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:49,005
No, I'm here.
I'm at the bar.

49
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,069
I'm at the bar, too.

50
00:01:50,147 --> 00:01:52,116
You are? What bar?

51
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:57,677
I'm at the bar,
the bar that's located
in the lobby of the hotel.

52
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,014
I do not see you.

53
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:00,113
How long have you...

54
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,285
I've been here about, gosh,
over half an hour.

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,589
Okay, yeah, me, too.

56
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:06,726
Sorry.
Sorry.

57
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,889
What are you wearing?

58
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:10,491
I'm wearing
a gray suit, red tie.

59
00:02:10,867 --> 00:02:12,495
Are we both at
the right place?

60
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,997
Which place...

61
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:16,165
I hear your voice.

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,673
I hear your...
I see your lips moving.

63
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,004
I hear your voice

64
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:23,275
in the phone.
And that's... Man!
And...

65
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:26,206
Michael Scott.

66
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:27,273
Deangelo Vickers.

67
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:28,614
Wow.

68
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,654
That is insane.

69
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:33,520
"That is insane" is right.
That's the right term.

70
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,355
Bartender,
let's get some vodka
up in this cranberry

71
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:37,792
and one for my friend.

72
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:39,022
Here we go. Ready?

73
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:40,155
I am ready.

74
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,391
All right, here we go.

75
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:47,004
Well, this is it.
What do you think?

76
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:51,906
She'll do.
Oh, she'll do just fine.

77
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:57,607
I am very much
looking forward
to tomorrow. It is...

78
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:00,741
It feels like
the culmination of
a lot of hard work,

79
00:03:00,817 --> 00:03:02,786
a lot of good fortune and...

80
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:07,353
Hey, come on. Did that...
Did that just happen?

81
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:11,285
We should write
a movie or something.
I'm serious.

82
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:35,144
Michael is leaving.

83
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:38,450
And apparently
they already hired
a new manager.

84
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:41,754
And we're meeting him today.
It's a lot to process.

85
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:44,689
Paperwork-wise.

86
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:54,102
Nope, it's not Ashton Kutcher.
It's Kevin Malone.

87
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:57,300
Equally handsome,
equally smart.

88
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:01,871
Okay, everyone,
as you know,

89
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:05,814
one of my favorite things
is fanfare for its own sake.

90
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:08,113
So without further ado,

91
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,177
let's all start clapping.

92
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,486
Presenting Deangelo Vickers!

93
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:21,256
Hi. Hello.

94
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:23,997
MICHAEL: Come on out!

95
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:28,462
Hello. Hey.
How are you, sir?

96
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:29,904
I'm well, sir,
how are you?

97
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:33,000
Uh, can I just say
I am so excited
to be working here.

98
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:37,808
Little bit about myself,
I love the American southwest,
for starters.

99
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:41,611
You may call them
Arizona, New Mexico,
Nevada, Utah.

100
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:43,012
I call them heaven.

101
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:46,022
I have a peanut allergy,
something I live with.

102
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,456
It's a part of me.
I've learned to cope
with it. What else?

103
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:53,793
I'm just as
comfortable at a ball game
as I am at the opera.

104
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:55,421
I was a...

105
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:58,435
Did I want to be
made manager? Sure.

106
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:01,028
A great opportunity
squandered? Absolutely.

107
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:03,767
A crushing blow? Yes.

108
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,305
Will I get over it?

109
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:07,400
Mmm...

110
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:09,745
No.

111
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:12,510
But life goes on.
Not for me.

112
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,980
I'll get that,
you guys. Don't...

113
00:05:19,122 --> 00:05:20,283
No, I'll help you. Here.

114
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:21,450
You know, it's just...

115
00:05:21,792 --> 00:05:23,090
You know...

116
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:26,627
Hi.
Hello. Hi.

117
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:29,530
Have we met before?

118
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,098
No, not officially.
I saw you coming out
of the bathroom earlier.

119
00:05:34,237 --> 00:05:36,604
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go back to my cave.

120
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,471
Okay.
It was really
great meeting you.

121
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:43,141
And that is what
they call a meet cute.

122
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:46,379
So we talked for
like 20 minutes,

123
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,179
no clue it's Deangelo
the whole time.

124
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:50,647
It's kind of embarrassing.

125
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,847
No, no.

126
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:54,147
Yeah, that story
makes you sound stupid.

127
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:58,252
I happen to like
the hilarious high jinks
that I get myself into.

128
00:05:58,728 --> 00:05:59,889
There he is, there he is.

129
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:03,593
Deangelo, I was just
telling them about last night
when we met.

130
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:05,864
Remember that?

131
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:07,928
That was crazy.
That was crazy.

132
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:10,439
Let's see,
where's my replacement?

133
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:13,309
Where's the guy
I'm replacing?
I don't know.

134
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:15,242
Why don't I look
to my left?
I know.

135
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:16,780
He's sitting right there.
I know.

136
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,712
Well, that's what I was
just saying. That's...

137
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:24,652
That exact situation
is why I always carry
around a couple of these.

138
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:26,087
Just in case,
'cause, you know,

139
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:27,454
sometimes you need
to ID yourself.

140
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:30,286
Office funny guy.

141
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:33,228
Always glad to have
an office funny guy around.

142
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:35,325
ANDY: I wasn't even
trying to make a joke.

143
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:40,896
I guess I've always
been sort of quirky,
offbeat, a little twisted.

144
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,566
This is Jim and Pam,
a.k.a. Jap.

145
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:49,510
What started as an affair
has blossomed into
a family before our eyes.

146
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:51,479
Well, it wasn't...
It wasn't an affair.
Yes, it was.

147
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:53,176
But, no,
but we are a family.

148
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,513
We made that.

149
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:55,813
Cecelia.
DEANGELO: Oh!

150
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,249
Congratulations.
Thank you.

151
00:06:58,321 --> 00:06:59,380
I have four kids
of my own.

152
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:00,515
Really?
Yeah.

153
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,527
Oh, my gosh,
well, we just have the one,
but she poops for four.

154
00:07:04,861 --> 00:07:05,851
Uh-oh.

155
00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:08,922
Someone started off
on a good foot
with the new boss.

156
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,468
Yeah, they don't
ever talk about careers
that were made

157
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:14,436
because of unplanned
pregnancies. So...

158
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,666
Psst. Thanks for
meeting me.

159
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,764
Are you kidding?

160
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:19,605
I would come anywhere
to see a turtle.
Yeah.

161
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:20,769
Where'd you find him?

162
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:23,275
There's no turtle, Michael.
I just wanted to get
you here.

163
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:26,315
You know me
very well, Dwight.

164
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:28,579
That's because I'm your
right-hand man, Michael.

165
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:30,450
But I can't do it.
I can't do it again.

166
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,352
I can't be a right-hand man
to a whole new guy.

167
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:35,051
Now, I'm gonna
have to go online
and look at turtles

168
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,491
or else I'm gonna
be off the whole day.

169
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:38,653
I want to be manager.

170
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:43,029
I just don't understand
why I wasn't even
interviewed for the job.

171
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:44,123
I mean, what's wrong?

172
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,102
I'm totally qualified.
You were pushing for me.

173
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,866
That apple looks delish.

174
00:07:52,275 --> 00:07:53,641
I do a lot of
portion control.

175
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,302
Try to keep my daily
caloric intake
under 1,200.

176
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:58,505
Deangelo, you're going
to starve to death.

177
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:01,546
So you decided
to have an orgy
and not invite me?

178
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:03,086
Come on. I call middle.

179
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,889
That's cool that you
like the southwest.

180
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:08,789
It's one of my
favorite regions.

181
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:10,019
"It's one of my
favorite regions."

182
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:12,892
Did I just sound
totally lame?

183
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:14,756
Oh.

184
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:17,233
I sounded good.

185
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:20,871
I love the desert.
It's one of my
favorite ecosystems.

186
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:23,099
Here's the great thing
about the southwest,

187
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:25,836
there is so much
more than desert.

188
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:28,105
Along the north rim
of the Grand Canyon

189
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:30,340
is a forest as lush
as you've ever seen.

190
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:32,573
Burned. It's lush, dummy.

191
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:36,209
Hey, Deangelo,
what do you think
about bald people?

192
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:38,716
I hate them.

193
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:41,280
Deangelo, I forget,
did you mention
you like politics?

194
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:42,348
I did not.

195
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:45,862
Because I was thinking,
you should meet my boyfriend.
He's a state senator.

196
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:49,297
I really think the two
of you would hit it off.
He's a great person to know.

197
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,196
Sounds very interesting,
thank you.

198
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,462
ANGELA: Mmm-hmm.

199
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,699
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin.
Okay, let me transfer you.

200
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,034
Why do you use your name
when you answer the phone?

201
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,272
Oh, that's how Pam does it.
I just copy her.

202
00:09:02,345 --> 00:09:04,337
She's sort of
a living legend.

203
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:07,076
Try it without
using your name.

204
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,385
Dunder Mifflin. This is.

205
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:12,352
Oh, yeah, I like it.

206
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:14,891
Dunder Mifflin.
How may I assist you?

207
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:16,485
Oh. "Assist."

208
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,583
I sort of like
the old way.

209
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,155
I just prefer it
without the name.

210
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,132
And I thought...
Okay. No, no, no.

211
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,065
I've got to start doing
some managing at
some point, right?

212
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:27,104
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
But if it's not a big deal,

213
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,695
we should just
do the old way.
And it really isn't.

214
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:30,468
Okay. That good?
ERIN: Yeah, okay, good.

215
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,441
Well, I'd like to
change it, actually.

216
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,671
MICHAEL: Well,
you know, whatever...

217
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:36,303
Yeah.
Whatever you think
would work.

218
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,908
What do you...
Yeah.

219
00:09:38,314 --> 00:09:39,646
I think a change
would be nice.

220
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:43,380
You could do the old
way or the, you know...
Whichever one you want to do.

221
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:44,785
Mmm-hmm.

222
00:09:47,557 --> 00:09:48,786
DEANGELO:
Change it.

223
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,430
I'm so sorry.

224
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:14,275
Hey, funny guy.
I have a little
midday lull here.

225
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,643
Make me laugh. Huh?
What do you got?

226
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,146
I can't even look
at you.

227
00:10:18,221 --> 00:10:19,280
Here we go.

228
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:21,180
Okay...

229
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:26,922
What do
African Americans
call the...

230
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:34,431
What?

231
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:35,699
ERIN: Deangelo?
Yeah?

232
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:36,796
Did you order a barber?

233
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:38,671
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on back here.

234
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:41,544
Put a pin on that, okay?
I can't wait to hear
the punch line.

235
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,079
Finish the joke, Andy.

236
00:10:44,781 --> 00:10:46,579
What do
African Americans call?

237
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,644
I don't know. Help me.

238
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,082
That is so bad-ass.

239
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:54,814
Just so hardcore.

240
00:10:54,891 --> 00:10:56,519
Yeah, very cool.

241
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:57,822
Real power move.
Yeah.

242
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:03,222
I saw a hawk today.

243
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,533
It was just
sitting right there

244
00:11:05,602 --> 00:11:08,265
on the overpass,
looking at me.

245
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:12,904
Shave me.

246
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:18,706
Well, this is going
to be funny.

247
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,875
Because it looks like
we're gonna be
shaving buddies.

248
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,182
Okay, all right.
I love it. I love it.

249
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:26,155
Michael, this is Reggie.
Hello.

250
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:27,781
He is the number one

251
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:30,156
Yelp-reviewed
shaver in Scranton.
It's not even close.

252
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:33,754
And this is Erin,
and she's going
to shave my face.

253
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,196
Here we go.

254
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:42,997
All right.

255
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:46,176
This is how we do it.

256
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:47,369
MICHAEL: Mmm.

257
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:48,433
Feels nice, doesn't it?

258
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,843
It really does.

259
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,544
This is luxury.
Here we go.

260
00:11:58,655 --> 00:12:00,487
Okay.
Okay.

261
00:12:00,557 --> 00:12:02,287
Oh, that is nice.

262
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:04,321
You wanted to
talk to us, Deangelo?

263
00:12:04,394 --> 00:12:07,023
Oh, yes, yes, please.
Cozy up there.

264
00:12:07,197 --> 00:12:09,757
I just thought we could
have some rap sessions
with smaller groups.

265
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:13,132
You know, we don't
really do rap sessions,
we kind of do... God!

266
00:12:13,937 --> 00:12:16,338
We sort of do
more of like powwows
and what-ups.

267
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:18,071
Okay, well,
powwows, then. Fine.

268
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:19,370
That's...

269
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:22,412
Hey, Deangelo,
my mom just sent me
this picture of Cece.

270
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:23,536
It is so adorable.

271
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,246
All right, wait,
but a little bit
of back story.

272
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:26,715
She loves dogs,
she calls them dadas...

273
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:27,842
Dadas.

274
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,476
and what happens is...
You know what?

275
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:31,783
Enough about
your baby, okay?

276
00:12:32,922 --> 00:12:33,981
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,685
Well, we were just...
I think she was
just trying to...

278
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:38,819
No, no, no,
I know what you're doing.
Just quit it.

279
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,361
I want to hear from
the rank and file.

280
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:46,335
How can I be
the best manager
for you all?

281
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:48,098
You know,
what can I do better?

282
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:50,003
Okay, you know
what, everybody?

283
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:52,633
There's... You have
to be honest here.

284
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:56,578
You can't say that everything
is perfect, right?

285
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,909
So, you know,
come up with something.

286
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:02,817
OSCAR: Well, Deangelo,
I'd say communication
could be improved.

287
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:05,421
People stopped
reading memos.

288
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:06,888
So everyone
marks them urgent.

289
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:09,323
Okay, you know what?
I mark it urgent "A,"

290
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,691
urgent "B,"
urgent "C," urgent "D."

291
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,662
Urgent "A" is
the most important,

292
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,132
urgent "D" you don't even
really have to worry about.

293
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:19,734
Okay, Michael,
can you stop talking now?
I have to do your lips.

294
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,633
Don't shave my lips.

295
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:25,800
What's up?

296
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,707
I don't mean to go off
on a rant here, but...

297
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,109
I wrote the perfect joke.
Topical, edgy, funny.

298
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:36,912
I saw this thing in the news.
Democrats want electric cars.

299
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:38,852
Republicans don't.
Right.

300
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,913
I'm thinking,
how crazy is it

301
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,893
that we got
a car debate going on
in a city known for gridlock.

302
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:48,892
Um... Let's not talk politics
in the office, okay?

303
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,532
I like you better
as the funny guy.

304
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:54,628
I wasn't taking a position.
It was just sort of
one of those things.

305
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:07,113
Now that's funny.
That's funny.

306
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:08,581
You walk much?

307
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:10,754
Yeah, right? I mean...

308
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:17,253
A little click.
Mmm-hmm.

309
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:21,162
Deangelo, this box
came for you.

310
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,323
Great, thank you.

311
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:25,567
That's my stuff. Yeah.

312
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:27,730
Michael, take a look
at this.

313
00:14:27,804 --> 00:14:29,636
Need a hand?
Oh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

314
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:31,038
Hey, you know what?
This office sort of

315
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:33,474
has a perfect
fung shooey to it, and...

316
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:37,977
You know,
let's not go overboard
with the redecorating.

317
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,709
And I'm
still here, so...
Wow.

318
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:40,806
Right?
Ooh.

319
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:41,873
That's nice.

320
00:14:42,151 --> 00:14:44,279
I still have to look
at this stuff, guys, so...

321
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,546
Oh, man. So this is
a 10-gallon hat?

322
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,215
Yeah, you like that?
10-gallon hat.

323
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,783
Technically, it only
holds about 3 quarts.

324
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,759
A little factoid.
Interesting.

325
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,757
MICHAEL: Deangelo's great.
I love the guy.

326
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:58,329
But I'm not sure
he's a good fit
for the office.

327
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:01,337
And also, I'm not sure
if I love the guy.

328
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:06,773
Cool, cool.

329
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,805
All right,
see you later, girl.

330
00:15:08,878 --> 00:15:10,039
Hey, hey, hey.

331
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:13,506
No, I'm good. Keep that.

332
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:18,678
Hey, funny man.
What you got for me?
Make me laugh.

333
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:39,908
Let's see if
my favorite tea is in...

334
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,341
Whoa! Jeez.

335
00:15:58,127 --> 00:15:59,254
That's hot coffee.

336
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,362
Drink some soap.

337
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,293
Eat some hand soap.

338
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:15,239
I guess this is my life now.

339
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:18,411
How do I become
a manager at Sabre?

340
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:20,516
Well, first things first,

341
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,484
thank you for coming
to me directly, you know.

342
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:24,020
I know you could
have called Tallahassee,

343
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,021
but it would have
just looped back to me.

344
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:27,487
So it's cool you
recognized my role here.

345
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:28,820
I left a message
at corporate.

346
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,583
There you go.

347
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:32,526
Get a recommendation
from Michael.

348
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:34,461
That'll put you
right on the short list

349
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,828
for next time
there's an opening.

350
00:16:36,098 --> 00:16:38,363
Can't you just use
the recommendation
you already have on file?

351
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,363
What recommendation?

352
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:42,504
From when
he recommended me
to replace him.

353
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,032
Um...

354
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:50,542
I'm sorry.
I never know how to act

355
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:52,844
in these awkward
type situations.

356
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:56,376
Best whale watching?
Easily the West Coast.

357
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:57,943
If you're gonna
go whale watching
on the East Coast,

358
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,047
you might want to
bring a magazine called
West Coast Whales.

359
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:03,356
Because you're
not gonna see...

360
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:07,089
Snack time!
It's the witching hour.
It is the sandwiching hour.

361
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:08,253
Awesome.

362
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,355
PHYLLIS: Hmm. What you got?

363
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:11,298
PB and J. My mom's recipe.

364
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,495
Michael, Deangelo
has a peanut allergy.

365
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,164
Okay, I need a wide berth.
I need a wide berth
from those nuts.

366
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,873
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

367
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:20,375
I think Kevin wants one.
Kevin, here you go.

368
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:23,273
OSCAR: Michael,
this is serious.

369
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,144
Do you know what happens
if Deangelo touches a peanut?

370
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:26,238
What?

371
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,511
Michael, the last time
I was exposed to a peanut,

372
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:30,780
I was itchy for
three days, okay?

373
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:33,914
I had to take
baths constantly.
I missed the O.J. verdict.

374
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,652
Had to read about it in
the paper like an idiot.

375
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:38,695
Wait, so you
don't go into, like,
shock or die or anything?

376
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:42,525
No, Jim. Not
everything's life and death.
I want to feel comfortable.

377
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,664
Oscar, here you go.

378
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:46,228
Oh! Whoa!

379
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:48,533
You're getting nut
particles all in the air.

380
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:52,041
No one had
a problem with the air here
until you came around.

381
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,814
Everyone, mandatory meeting.
Multi-purpose room, now.

382
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:05,218
No, that's good.
You just stay in there.

383
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:06,881
Except for Michael.
Stay in there
by yourself, loser.

384
00:18:06,956 --> 00:18:08,982
Nobody go in.
Nobody go in there.
Why?

385
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:10,492
Why?
Stay where you are.

386
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,823
Michael, this is insane.

387
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:13,226
No, it's not
insane, Oscar.

388
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:15,231
I've been here
for 19 years,

389
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:16,994
and just because
someone else is
called the boss,

390
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,432
you're gonna throw
it all away? No, no.

391
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:26,371
Listen, you're the one
who decided to leave.

392
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:29,037
Come on, he's our new boss.
You know we have to do this.

393
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:30,645
Okay.

394
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:34,240
Well, who needs them?

395
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,580
Looks like it's just
you and me, Dwight.

396
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:38,953
Correction.
Just you.

397
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,088
All right. Meeting,
multi-function room.

398
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,389
DEANGELO: Apology accepted.

399
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:50,089
Hold on.

400
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:55,564
Hey, Michael.
Michael, wait up,
hold up. Hold up.

401
00:18:56,906 --> 00:18:57,896
Um...

402
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:00,268
So, for these meetings,

403
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,278
do you just jump
into business

404
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:04,211
or do you start
with some chitchat or...

405
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:09,074
I start with some chitchat
and maybe a couple of jokes.

406
00:19:10,486 --> 00:19:12,978
And you might
want to develop
a couple of characters.

407
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,588
You know what?
You just...
You'll be fine.

408
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,625
Maybe, maybe not. 50-50.

409
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:23,397
You know,
it is too bad for this place
that you're leaving.

410
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,105
Bring it in. Come on.

411
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,643
Bring it.

412
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,142
Okay. Okay.

413
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:54,891
Why did you have
to be so damn good?

414
00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:57,961
I... I'm adequate.

415
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,331
I'm half as good as you.

416
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:03,235
No, no, no.
Come on.

417
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:06,139
You are good.
They know it.
Come on.

418
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:10,236
I just didn't expect you
to get there so fast.

419
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:13,846
DEANGELO: Would you do me
a favor and enjoy this time,
okay? You've worked so hard.

420
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,045
Get your senioritis on.
It's Lake Havasu time.

421
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:19,648
I guess I've been
working so hard

422
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:21,850
I forgot what it's like
to be hardly working.

423
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:28,428
Okay.

424
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:35,838
What is the Native
American girl's name?

425
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:37,664
You'll figure it out.

426
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,846
DEANGELO:
Thank you, Dwight.

427
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,113
DWIGHT: Thank you, sir.

428
00:20:53,823 --> 00:20:55,052
DEANGELO: Listen up...

429
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:02,231
Hey, Deangelo.
Want to meet Cece?

430
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,371
That's a cute baby.

431
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,035
Very cute baby.
Adorable. Very cute.

432
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,442
Thank you very much.

433
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:16,740
See? We knew it.

434
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:18,337
If he just met her,
he'd understand.

435
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:19,882
We're back in.

436
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:21,416
Ha.
Ha.

437
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:22,577
Right?

438
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:25,416
I'm telling you, that baby
could be the star of a show

439
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:27,957
called Babies I
Don't Care About.
