1
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:08,820
Why?

2
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:11,054
Twenty minutes a day, Jim.
That's all it takes.

3
00:00:12,065 --> 00:00:13,761
Twenty minutes a day,
all feet, no hands,

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:15,631
and I'll have
the pedidexterity of a chimp,

5
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:18,103
and you'll be sitting
there like an idiot.

6
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:20,770
Okay, here we go. Yes.

7
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,909
Do you mind?
I'm sorry, Pam.

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,245
Allow me to write
you an apology letter.

9
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:27,842
You don't have to do that.

10
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:29,005
D...

11
00:00:29,316 --> 00:00:30,340
E...

12
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:32,884
A...

13
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:34,315
Oh...

14
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:37,614
Backspace,
A... Dear...

15
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,592
Thank you, hands.

16
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:46,065
Nothing else in the universe
can do what you do.

17
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:57,507
Don't worry about it.
Dwight, it's okay.
You were wrong.

18
00:00:57,878 --> 00:00:58,868
It's so hot.

19
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:09,151
Well, "A" for effort, right?

20
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,300
Welcome.
Start your morning right

21
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:29,569
with a burst of
blueberry or try plain.

22
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:30,633
What's the occasion?

23
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,078
Dwight said this entry
was a waste of space.

24
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:37,140
I would like
un muffin du blueberry,
por favor.

25
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:38,808
$8.

26
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:39,875
$8?

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,119
Owning a building is a war
between
the landlord and the tenant.

28
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,022
Not a literal war,
unfortunately,

29
00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:46,990
but I am using
the same tactics.

30
00:01:47,227 --> 00:01:51,130
I've surrounded the enemy,
and I'm slowly starving them.

31
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:53,292
To save on electricity,
I have installed a timer

32
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,527
and motion
sensors on the lights.

33
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:59,596
It's part of my
green initiative.
And by green, I mean money.

34
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:02,532
Mmm-hmm.

35
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,635
China. China.

36
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,173
Michael, how was the dentist?

37
00:02:07,047 --> 00:02:08,071
It was great.

38
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:09,372
China.

39
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,107
Are you okay?
What's wrong?

40
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:13,244
Everything here was
made in China, Pam.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,583
Yeah, that's where
they make stuff.

42
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:17,682
They used to make
stuff in America, Andy,
but we're falling behind.

43
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:18,748
Did you know that?

44
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,521
China is a sleeping dragon
that is just
beginning to stir.

45
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:23,825
Oh, no.
Yeah.

46
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,398
Right here.
It is right there.

47
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,267
Anybody read the news anymore?

48
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:32,234
"China is on the move."

49
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,797
I found that in
the waiting room
at the dentist's office.

50
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,776
This kid had
the magazine I wanted to read.

51
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:38,334
That's the only
one I could reach,

52
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:40,003
and I read it and
then I read it again.

53
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:43,481
My whole life I believed
that America was number one.

54
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,813
That was the saying.

55
00:02:44,885 --> 00:02:48,219
Not America's number two.
England is number two.

56
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:51,725
China should be, like, eight.

57
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:53,683
Hey, Andy.

58
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:55,120
Hey, Darryl.

59
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:57,327
You gotta stop
texting me so much.

60
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:01,827
But I wanted you to know that
Michael and I are
wearing the same tie today.

61
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:02,892
It's insane.

62
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:06,196
You need to
change your standard
for what's worthy of a text.

63
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:09,539
Ask yourself,
"Is this something
Darryl needs to know?"

64
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:11,305
The answer's
almost always "no."

65
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,540
Got it.
Then, I will call you.

66
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:14,603
No.

67
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:17,484
There was a time
when the only
people who texted you

68
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,783
were people you
wanted to text you. Girls.

69
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:24,086
And they'd all
say the same thing.
"I'm coming over, baby."

70
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:28,959
And I would text back. B-T-B.
"Bring that Booty."

71
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,067
Dwight.
Why is the toilet
paper only half a ply?

72
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,970
I'm sorry.
Is that not good
enough for your anus?

73
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:41,007
Don't get me started on
how coddled
the modern anus is.

74
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:42,565
Okay, Stanley,

75
00:03:42,642 --> 00:03:45,111
maybe you can just
unspool a little more
each time you need to...

76
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:47,113
Don't tell me how
to do my business.

77
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:51,776
Stanley, as a fellow
Dunder Mifflin employee,
I feel for you,

78
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:54,549
but, like you,
I am completely powerless

79
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:55,782
to the whims of
the new building owner.

80
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:56,846
Which is you.

81
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,615
"Which is you"
is not a sentence.

82
00:03:58,792 --> 00:04:00,055
I disagree with.

83
00:04:00,193 --> 00:04:01,889
Are you gonna just sit there,
office administrator,

84
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:03,624
or are you gonna do something?

85
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,065
Dwight, can we talk
about these cut backs?

86
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:11,533
Pam, when I'm
sitting at this desk,
I'm a salesman.

87
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,164
If you wanna talk to
the new building owner,

88
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,106
you should call Nate
and schedule an appointment.

89
00:04:15,408 --> 00:04:16,899
I'm not gonna do that.

90
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:19,003
Well, then you're
not going to talk
to the new building owner,

91
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,069
which is a shame,

92
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:21,809
because I hear he's
a very reasonable guy.

93
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,385
Y'ello?
Hi, Nate. It's Pam Halpert.

94
00:04:26,453 --> 00:04:27,443
Oh, hey, Pam.

95
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:30,389
Hey,
I would just love to schedule
a meeting today with Dwight.

96
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:32,925
Let me put you on hold
just for one eensy second.

97
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:34,353
Sure.

98
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:38,824
Dwight Schrute.

99
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,055
Mmm-hmm.

100
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,060
Tell her I'm busy.

101
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,294
I don't know.
Make something up.

102
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:48,704
NATE: Hey, Pam,
Dwight's being
questioned by the police

103
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:52,678
in connection with
a string of dognappings
that have been...

104
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:54,236
Dwight.

105
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:58,609
Dwight, can you please tell
the new building owner

106
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:01,052
that he is screwing over
all the people he works with.

107
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,784
People he's
worked with for years,
his friends.

108
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:07,085
You know what, Pam?
You're right.

109
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:10,089
This isn't just a business,

110
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,128
this is a home.

111
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,294
And I would much rather see
a smile from Kevin

112
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:17,997
than save hundreds
on plumbing and electricity.

113
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,363
ERIN: Oh, my God.

114
00:05:21,474 --> 00:05:22,464
What?

115
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:25,444
According to the Internet,
the tallest man in
the world is Chinese.

116
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:27,543
So much for keeping
our secrets up high.

117
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:28,871
What's America gonna do?

118
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:31,517
I know what we're gonna do.
We're gonna put
our best minds on it.

119
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:35,651
Everybody, stop working.

120
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:38,622
I want you all
to imagine a world

121
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:40,888
in which America is not
the number one superpower,

122
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:43,530
where forks are irrelevant,

123
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:46,489
and where every man,
woman and child

124
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:49,332
is expected to learn
how to play the cello.

125
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:51,527
Now, open your eyes.

126
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:52,971
You never told
us to close them.

127
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:54,504
Welcome to your future.

128
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,166
What do we do?
How do we stop this?

129
00:05:56,476 --> 00:05:59,605
How do we stop it?
With a big idea.

130
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,278
That's what
America is built on.

131
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,945
Big ideas,
blue jeans, the Grand Canyon.

132
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:07,954
Who's got one?
Who's got a big idea?

133
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:09,580
An idea bigger
than the Grand Canyon?

134
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:11,316
MICHAEL: Yes, indeed.

135
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:13,382
Yes, Kevin.

136
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:17,494
An antacid that you
only take once a week.

137
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:22,799
Once-a-week antacid
is the idea to beat.
Anyone else?

138
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:24,764
Nobody?

139
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:25,828
Okay, then, we are...

140
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:26,896
Michael.
Yes.

141
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:31,536
An antacid pill
that you take
once every six weeks.

142
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:33,273
Why not just go
one for the year?

143
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:34,336
I don't know.

144
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,349
It's too big
a pill to swallow.
MICHAEL: All right.

145
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,318
What if we all get together
and help each other,

146
00:06:39,386 --> 00:06:41,480
and hire a new guy
and then we all kill him,

147
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:44,581
but first we take out, like,
a $100,000 life
insurance policy?

148
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:46,422
I bet you guys like
that idea, don't you?

149
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:49,352
I think that's what
they're doing to me.

150
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:52,888
I can't prove it,
but I wanted to see
their faces when I said it.

151
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,229
I learned nothing.

152
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,769
I don't know
what the that was.

153
00:06:56,836 --> 00:06:57,826
I say we bomb 'em.

154
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:00,169
By 2020, they're gonna be
the world's largest economy,

155
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,142
and they're getting
a taste for protein.
We'll all starve.

156
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,677
Yeah, Dwight's right,
we should drop the bomb.

157
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:06,007
MICHAEL: No, he's not right.
We're not...

158
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,809
Where would we
even drop it, Phyllis?

159
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:12,447
Did you know that in China
there are 56 cities
with over a million people?

160
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,351
You know how many
we have here? Nine.

161
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:15,912
Actually, that's not true.

162
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:17,651
I know the figure
you're referring to,

163
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,453
and it's a projection
of 15 years from now.

164
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:20,550
KEVIN: Thank God.

165
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:22,118
No. No,
that is right now.

166
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:25,490
Michael, China's agrarian.
Urbanizing fast?
You betcha.

167
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:26,555
But still agrarian.

168
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,096
Most in terms of land,
not population.

169
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:30,398
Come on,
Michael, you couldn't...

170
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,766
No! No, you're
wrong about this.

171
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:34,204
Where are you
getting this information?

172
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:35,936
I got it from
newyorktimes.com.

173
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:37,033
Uh-oh.

174
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,079
Getting nervous, Oscar?

175
00:07:39,145 --> 00:07:40,272
Okay, someone
look it up.

176
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,574
I'm on it, Jim. I'm on it.

177
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:43,082
Guys, it's not worth it.
Really.

178
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:45,118
Guys, this is not
worth our time.

179
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:47,051
"Are you watching this?"
Seriously?

180
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:48,811
Well, are you?

181
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,217
I'm sitting right here.

182
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:51,852
DARRYL: Got it.

183
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:55,660
China has 56 cities
with a population
of over one million.

184
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:58,631
The U.S. has nine.

185
00:07:59,132 --> 00:08:01,124
Suck it, Oscar.

186
00:08:01,201 --> 00:08:03,170
Well, on the plus side,
all this worrying about China

187
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:04,932
has made you smarter
than Oscar, Michael.

188
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:06,366
Great, I was wrong.

189
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,007
I'm wrong.
Is everyone happy?

190
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:12,076
So, I happen to know more
than the smartest
guy in the office.

191
00:08:12,145 --> 00:08:15,547
So what?
I don't care.

192
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:18,877
Okay, now, where were we
before I bested Oscar?

193
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,889
Wow, so this
building can get uglier.

194
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:26,950
I will not work in
a roach billboard.

195
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:29,053
Oh, my God.
I can't look at roaches.

196
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:30,921
Michael,
do something about this.

197
00:08:30,997 --> 00:08:33,398
Absolutely.
Pam, this is exactly why

198
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,025
I hired you as
office administrator.

199
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:36,091
Handle it.

200
00:08:36,236 --> 00:08:37,568
Taking care
of business.

201
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:40,433
Dwight, take it down.

202
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,569
I'm serious.
Take it down or else.

203
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:47,336
Or else. Or else what?
There's nothing you can do.

204
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:50,177
We can move out.

205
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:57,346
Ugh.

206
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:58,414
Really?

207
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:09,595
So, does anyone wanna know
where I've been for
the last two hours?

208
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:12,161
Oh, my God, I've been playing
Zombie Soccer for two hours?

209
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:15,208
I went out to look for
a better office space.

210
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:16,875
Waste of time.
Not really,

211
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:18,472
because I found one.

212
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,104
JIM: Oh, wow.

213
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:22,237
These are nice.
Yep.

214
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:23,305
Let me see.

215
00:09:24,784 --> 00:09:26,184
Look at the huge offices, Jim.
Yeah, I know.

216
00:09:26,252 --> 00:09:28,278
Check out that
conference room.
Totally.

217
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:29,583
You can't just move out.

218
00:09:29,722 --> 00:09:30,985
Oh, in three months we can.

219
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:32,047
Check the lease.

220
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,117
And if you don't
undo all the changes
you've made, we're moving.

221
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:35,662
Hey, guys,
can I show you some pictures?

222
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,923
Oh, my gosh, she's so cute.
She looks like both of you.

223
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:39,795
They're not of Cece.
Oh, cool.

224
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,235
This is possibly our new
Dunder Mifflin office.

225
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:44,328
Well, I like being
in the same building as Bob.

226
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:45,463
It keeps me honest.

227
00:09:45,538 --> 00:09:48,531
Well, this building isn't far,
and it's much newer.

228
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,770
There's a dry cleaner,
a nail place and a gym.

229
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:52,677
Oh, and it's next
door to an Outback,

230
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,178
so it always
smells like steak.

231
00:09:54,314 --> 00:09:55,805
Are you trying to kill me?

232
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:58,746
Is the nail place
Koreans or whites?

233
00:09:58,952 --> 00:09:59,942
Koreans.

234
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,918
Good. And the dry cleaners?

235
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,078
White?

236
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:04,179
Good.

237
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:12,527
Whoa,
there's a lot of brain power
in this room.

238
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,464
We got Michael and Oscar,
the two smartest
guys in the office.

239
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:17,101
Also, in that order.

240
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:18,637
Funny. Jim, that is funny.

241
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,298
Very comedically
humorous, Jim.

242
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:21,568
KELLY:
I have a computer question.

243
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,132
Hey, Oscar?
What is it?

244
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:24,677
Can you move aside
so that I can ask Michael?

245
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:25,871
All right.
All right, I get it.

246
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:27,880
Michael,
how do I create a new tab?

247
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:30,117
Try control "P."

248
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:31,173
That's print.

249
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:33,183
Not if the printer
isn't hooked up.

250
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:35,449
You are making some very
dangerous assumptions, Oscar.

251
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:38,391
Oscar, it must be killing you
now that Michael
is smarter than you.

252
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:42,554
He's not smarter than me.
He was just right
about one thing.

253
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:46,691
Yeah, but it was
a really smart thing
to be right about, actually.

254
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:48,394
Actually, it was.

255
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:51,230
Around here,
Oscar is known as "Actually,"

256
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:54,474
because he will insert himself
into just about
any conversation

257
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,375
to add facts or
correct grammar.

258
00:10:57,477 --> 00:10:58,706
Actually, you're speculating.

259
00:10:58,778 --> 00:11:02,772
He really does fit
that old stereotype
of the smug, gay Mexican.

260
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,277
"Megan Fox. Question mark."
What's that mean?

261
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:10,119
Megan Fox. Come on.

262
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,853
You know what?

263
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:14,724
You're one bad text away
from getting blocked.

264
00:11:14,827 --> 00:11:17,729
Yes, but one good text
away from a high five.

265
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:18,787
You accept these terms?

266
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:20,088
Oh, it's on.

267
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:24,868
In your perfect world,
what would make
this building awesome?

268
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:27,030
I'm putting together
kind of a wish list.

269
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:29,666
I wish for a million wishes.

270
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:30,732
Yeah,

271
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,578
no, I'm not a genie.
I'm just talking about...

272
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,341
Then see you later,
building.

273
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,607
DWIGHT: You can't
possibly be serious.

274
00:11:35,748 --> 00:11:36,875
I said,
"See you later, building."

275
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,816
Hey, Michael.
Hey.

276
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:41,150
I was thinking
about some of the stuff
you said earlier about China.

277
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,211
Mmm.

278
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:44,119
I'd love to
talk more about it.
Yeah.

279
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:45,852
Maybe over
some coffee later?

280
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:47,324
Sure.

281
00:11:50,697 --> 00:11:52,666
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Do you know what
you just agreed to?

282
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:54,030
Just coffee, Jim.

283
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,499
No, it is not just coffee.

284
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:58,437
He's trying to
set you up, Michael.

285
00:11:58,605 --> 00:11:59,698
What's gonna happen is

286
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:01,263
he's gonna try to
bring up whatever

287
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,898
you're talking about
in a very casual way.

288
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:05,777
But secretly he'll be
trying to trip you up.

289
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:07,871
And when he does,
boom, it's awful.

290
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:09,405
Haven't you noticed that

291
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:10,643
I don't bring up
the Tour de France
around him?

292
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,740
Yes.

293
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:16,246
And then,
he will smugly pay the check
and make you feel so small.

294
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,954
All right, well,
I just need to learn
everything about China.

295
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:23,057
To be safe, I should learn
everything about everything,

296
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,722
but I don't have time,
okay? Okay.

297
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,356
I'll just learn about China

298
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:30,802
and science and geography
and math and literary.

299
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,929
No politics?

300
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,167
I'm pretty good on politics.

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,106
California is bankrupt.

302
00:12:36,175 --> 00:12:38,406
And California, California.

303
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:45,374
What?

304
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,680
Parlay.
My office. Five minutes.

305
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:51,647
Parlay?

306
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,928
Pirate code. He wants to meet.

307
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:57,096
So, everyone here
knows pirate code?

308
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:58,927
I understand it.
I can't speak it.

309
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,962
Pam, I am not
an unreasonable man.

310
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:06,939
If you guys stay,
I will stop
watering down the soap.

311
00:13:07,173 --> 00:13:08,971
You've been
watering down the soap?

312
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,773
Why do you even need soap?
Are you that bad at
going to the bathroom?

313
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,779
We want everything
back the way it was.

314
00:13:14,013 --> 00:13:15,174
You don't wanna move.

315
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:17,547
Moving is one of
the most stressful things
you can do in life.

316
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,518
You'll probably just
take it out on your kid.

317
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:22,645
Jim will turn to the drink.
The family will fall apart.

318
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:23,984
And 25 years from now,

319
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:28,758
Cece will become world
famous for stripping.

320
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:33,156
That's a sad story.
I have another one.

321
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:35,792
We move,
the other tenants follow,

322
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:36,961
the bank takes the building,

323
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:39,665
takes your farm,
takes your car and
beats the crap out of you.

324
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,068
Penniless, you die.

325
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,941
And my daughter, Cece,
dances on your
grave fully clothed.

326
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,519
RYAN: Where is Tibet?

327
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:58,613
Pass.

328
00:13:58,825 --> 00:13:59,815
When was China founded?

329
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:01,659
Pass.
Two for two. Keep it up.

330
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:02,718
Who is Mao?

331
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:06,056
Life line.

332
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,258
Damn it, Michael.

333
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,529
You are moments away
from the smack down
of your life.

334
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,960
If you don't know something,

335
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:14,007
steer the conversation back
to something you do know.

336
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:17,003
I could talk about boobs.
I bet he knows
nothing about boobs.

337
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:18,237
What do you know
about boobs?

338
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:22,910
Michael, I have
to tell you something.

339
00:14:23,015 --> 00:14:24,142
It's from Rocky II.
Thank you.

340
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:28,378
"This guy
doesn't just wanna win,

341
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,581
"you know,
he wants to bury you.

342
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,147
"He wants to humiliate you."

343
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:34,126
Wait, wait, wait.
How long is this gonna take?

344
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,592
I'm, like,
a quarter of the way through.

345
00:14:35,728 --> 00:14:36,718
Is it gonna be worth it?

346
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,286
No.

347
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:40,799
Just in case, Michael,
I made you a cheat sheet.

348
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:42,057
I don't need to cheat.

349
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:43,291
Show him how to use it.

350
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,931
10,706...

351
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,232
Here it is, right here.

352
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,534
Pull over. Pull over.

353
00:14:48,074 --> 00:14:50,339
Oh, my God.

354
00:14:50,576 --> 00:14:52,204
No way.

355
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:54,276
Man, look at that.

356
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:55,371
Yeah.

357
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:56,814
There's no building.

358
00:14:58,151 --> 00:14:59,380
This can only mean one thing.

359
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,782
Building's underground.

360
00:15:00,853 --> 00:15:02,151
She was lying.

361
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:03,314
Oh.

362
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:05,153
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam.

363
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,055
Pam, Pam, Pam.

364
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:08,116
Yeah?

365
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:09,418
Pam?

366
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:10,895
What?
I'm Pam.

367
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,730
DWIGHT: Oh.
No, you're not.

368
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:15,301
I'm sorry, we have a colleague
with the same name.

369
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:16,836
Oh, that's funny.

370
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:18,460
You're not
a liar too, are you?

371
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:20,837
I've been known
to bend the truth.

372
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:22,735
Damn it, Pam. Get out.

373
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:25,205
Right now.
Leave it. I mean it.
Get the hell out of here.

374
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:26,710
Go!

375
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:32,149
I can't wait to do to Pam
what I just did to Pam.

376
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:35,644
Hey, Pam?

377
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:36,778
Yeah.

378
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:38,154
You know,
I'm the only one here

379
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,623
that you haven't asked
about the new office.

380
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,158
I know,
because you're
the reason we're moving.

381
00:15:42,228 --> 00:15:44,493
Yeah, but I'm
still an employee here,

382
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:47,159
and that part of
me is really excited
about the change of scenery.

383
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:48,933
What's the square
footage in the new place?

384
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:50,660
I think it's
something like...

385
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,363
What's the exact
square footage?

386
00:15:52,438 --> 00:15:53,565
Um...

387
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,629
Let me see.

388
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:55,697
DWIGHT: How many
offices are there?

389
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:57,606
I'll just look at
the one-sheet myself.

390
00:15:57,677 --> 00:15:59,475
Actually, I don't know
what I did with the one-sheet.

391
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:03,111
You know, that's the problem.
You only have one sheet.

392
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:04,377
üDWIGHT LAUGHING
SARCASTICALLYä

393
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:06,775
Oh, you're
a funny guy, Pam.

394
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,717
What's the first thing
you guys are gonna do

395
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:11,620
when you move
into the new office?

396
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:13,159
I'm gonna walk down the hall,
and I'm gonna say,

397
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:17,220
"Wow, I can't believe
this is real, but it is."

398
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,598
I can't wait.
Mmm-hmm.

399
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,863
I lied about some
aspects of the building.

400
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:24,926
It's still on a bike path,
though, right?

401
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:26,833
There's no building.
It doesn't exist.

402
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:27,965
What does that mean?

403
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:30,541
I needed leverage,
so I pulled those
pictures off the Internet.

404
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,472
It's just this...

405
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,878
This office
administrator thing,
I don't want to...

406
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:37,275
What?

407
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:40,617
Fail.
I don't want
to fail. Again.

408
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:41,676
You didn't fail.

409
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,450
That's what you
said about art school,

410
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:45,285
and that's what
you said about sales.

411
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:47,391
And you didn't fail
those things either.

412
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:54,429
Well, I'm not an artist,
and I'm not a salesman.

413
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,661
So, what would you call it?

414
00:16:56,402 --> 00:16:58,871
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

415
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:03,102
Michael, the reason
I asked you down
here for this chat is

416
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,871
I've been
thinking that your fears

417
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:06,741
about China are
a bit exaggerated.

418
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:09,941
Did you know that
China has a new missile

419
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:13,211
that can sink a U.S.
naval carrier
900 miles off the coast?

420
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:14,276
We have missiles, too.

421
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:16,219
Did you also know
that China has secretly

422
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:18,221
been expanding
its nuclear arsenal?

423
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:19,548
But what do I know?

424
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,491
I mean, that's just
according to the Pentagon.

425
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:22,654
Our Pentagon.

426
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:28,728
I wasn't here.

427
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,063
What?

428
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:33,800
I wasn't here.
It's a pretty common saying.

429
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,842
You may want to log
it away for future use.

430
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,541
Well, thanks.
Yeah.

431
00:17:39,845 --> 00:17:43,873
China has been loaning us
billions upon
billions of dollars.

432
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,079
We are going to be owing them
for the rest of our lives,

433
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:48,143
and they will control us.

434
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,022
Actually, we're in
a mild recession right now,
I'll give you that,

435
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:55,525
but people use
China as the boogeyman
for all their problems.

436
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:57,291
In the 1980s, it was Japan.

437
00:17:57,363 --> 00:18:00,527
How then do you
explain that in the past year

438
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,830
manufacturing in
China has risen by 17%,

439
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:06,938
and in the U.S.
it has only risen by 8%?

440
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:09,305
Do you really think
that manufacturing
is a relevant indicator

441
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,844
of where the world
economy's heading
in 2011?

442
00:18:13,112 --> 00:18:14,580
Do you know
the comparative expansion

443
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:16,182
of, say, the
information sector?

444
00:18:16,248 --> 00:18:18,740
I'd say that's
far more relevant,
wouldn't you?

445
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,183
Don't...

446
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,749
I...

447
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,861
Hello. Hello.

448
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:37,961
You're breaking the law.
Impossible. I love the law.

449
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:39,595
Read article 19.

450
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:42,437
There are certain standards
that you have to
maintain the building at,

451
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:45,478
and that includes
comfortable temperatures
and adequate lighting.

452
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:48,480
It also means no more cutting
the tampons in two,

453
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:50,675
and no more tampering
with the toilet paper.

454
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:55,481
I see I've underestimated you,
and I didn't think
that was possible.

455
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:57,054
Nate.

456
00:18:58,424 --> 00:18:59,517
Re-ply the paper.

457
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:01,116
I don't think
it goes that way.

458
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,421
Re-ply it!

459
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:06,926
Don't worry about the coffee.
It's on me.

460
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:07,989
Yeah, I figured that.

461
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:12,805
Michael, I am so happy
that we were able to
have this little chat.

462
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,433
Wait.

463
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:18,102
You forgetting something?

464
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:19,705
What?
This chat.

465
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,141
Two men.
One white. One Latino.

466
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:26,617
A boss and a money cruncher.
I could fire you.

467
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:29,187
Fire him. No.
Show mercy.

468
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:30,514
But here we are.

469
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:31,919
What's your point?

470
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:33,356
My point is

471
00:19:35,494 --> 00:19:41,161
that as long as
people like you and me
don't stop talking,

472
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,293
nobody can stop the U.S.A.

473
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,496
Yeah, go, girl.
Right. Yes.

474
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:49,941
I am talking about freedom,
about choice.

475
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:51,773
America...

476
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,710
I don't think
you need to worry,

477
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:55,712
because if you want to
beat China, you will.

478
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:57,880
If you don't, that's fine.

479
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:01,818
That, my friend,
is your victory.

480
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:05,723
You know,
a lot of people say that

481
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,453
if you dig long
enough and hard enough,

482
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,688
you will get to China,
and that may be true,

483
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:11,520
but what they
don't tell you is that

484
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:16,297
if you dig long
enough and hard enough
in a conversation,

485
00:20:16,368 --> 00:20:17,700
you get to a friend.

486
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,541
So, here is to conversation.

487
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:23,665
That's not...

488
00:20:23,743 --> 00:20:26,474
Raise your cups
on high.

489
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:28,480
Case closed.
Yeah!

490
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:33,549
That wasn't what we were...
That wasn't the whole...

491
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,946
They say the best vampires
don't bleed their victims dry,

492
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:39,287
but give them the strength
so that they can bounce back,

493
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:40,485
only to be fed on again.

494
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:43,258
I spared Pam,
and I might feast

495
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:45,694
off of her profits
for years to come.

496
00:20:45,765 --> 00:20:48,929
I let Pam win.

497
00:20:50,436 --> 00:20:53,668
I was not
motivated by compassion.

498
00:20:53,773 --> 00:20:56,242
I have no compassion.

499
00:20:56,308 --> 00:21:01,406
Make sure you got that.
"Not motivated by compassion."

500
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:13,318
"Come to parking lot.
Crazy pigeon action."

501
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:20,322
Shh.

502
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:21,890
You're gonna scare them away.

503
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:30,442
That's a text.
Yeah, right?

504
00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:32,543
That's your new standard.
