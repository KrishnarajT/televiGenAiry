1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:05,045
Next up, secretary Schrute
will read the minutes
from Sunday's meeting.

2
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,959
"Minutes from
previous meeting,
of Knights of the Night."

3
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:12,819
No! Jim, hey.

4
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:13,920
Oh.

5
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:15,522
This meeting is for
Knights of the Night only.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,864
Knights of the Night are
volunteer crime patrollers.

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,425
We're often compared
to the Guardian Angels,

8
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:21,062
but we could not
be more different
from them.

9
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:25,005
Seriously, we are nothing
like the Guardian Angels.

10
00:00:25,075 --> 00:00:27,670
I mean,
broad strokes purposes, sure.

11
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:28,973
Think Guardian Angels.

12
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:30,810
One of our many
recent good deeds,

13
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,745
we set out to capture
the Scranton Strangler.

14
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:35,515
Mission accomplished.

15
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:36,917
Not by us.

16
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:39,489
I'm actually just
looking for my BlackBerry,
so carry on.

17
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,684
No, no, no, no, no.
I see how this movie ends.

18
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:43,590
You make fun of me,
everyone laughs.

19
00:00:43,727 --> 00:00:44,854
Ha, ha, ha.

20
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:45,918
Screw you.

21
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:48,927
Dwight, don't be bothered
by your friend's presence.

22
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:50,757
What are you gonna do now?

23
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,894
You gonna make fun
of our leader's
weird voice, huh?

24
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,564
"Dwight, don't be bothered..."

25
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:56,931
Over the line, Jim.

26
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,541
I'm just looking for my phone,
so pretend I'm not here.

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,875
Fine. "Minutes
from previous meeting
of Knights of the Night."

28
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:04,672
It's our official name, Jim.

29
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:05,874
Sounds good.

30
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,578
"Reflective strips
were glued to patrol jackets.

31
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,349
"Knights went outside
with flashlights
to test them."

32
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,514
Smart.

33
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:14,888
And the rest
was just boiler
plate stuff, that's...

34
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,324
Go ahead and read it,
some people weren't here.

35
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,417
Okay.

36
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,191
Knights stayed outside
to play flashlight tag.

37
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:22,198
Oh, come on.
That sounds awesome.

38
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:23,795
It was pretty cool.
Was it?

39
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:24,994
It was fun.

40
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:26,296
It was...
It was pretty awesome.

41
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,899
Hey, yeah. No, I got it.

42
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:34,775
Just leaving now.

43
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,229
January 3, 2011.

44
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,937
A day which will
live infamously.

45
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:06,234
Holly Partridge Flax,
otherwise known as Holly,

46
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,507
otherwise otherwise known
as a living, breathing angel,

47
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:11,411
is engaged to another man.

48
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:14,074
This is freaking me out. I...

49
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:17,651
Okay, let's just switch
to the happy video, okay?

50
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,020
No, no, no, no.
Let's push through.
We'll do this.

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,184
Today will either be
the best or
the worst day of my life.

52
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,052
Holly gave A.J. an ultimatum.

53
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,620
He either
proposes by New Year's
or they break up.

54
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:29,689
Now if she's engaged,
I'm gonna go crazy.

55
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,859
And I'm gonna
start attacking people.

56
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:34,268
If she's not engaged,
in all honesty,

57
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:35,396
I may just burn
this whole place

58
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:36,632
to the ground
out of happiness.

59
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:40,108
Either way, I am going to need
some talking down.

60
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:43,636
And nobody talks me down
like myself in
a video talking me down.

61
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,473
Michael,
I know what you're thinking.

62
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:47,848
Holly is engaged
to somebody else
and you want to kill yourself.

63
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,944
That may seem like
a good idea, but it's not.

64
00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:52,211
Snot.

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,890
Sorry, it sounded like
you said, "It's snot."
I'm so sorry.

66
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,353
Okay, so killing yourself...

67
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:01,988
I was just
thinking about snot.

68
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:06,995
Good morning.

69
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,936
Hey, guys. Uh, fun thing.

70
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,634
The index cards on your desk
are resolution cards.

71
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,637
You write
your New Year's
resolution on them,

72
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,378
I'll collect them,
and then display
the cards on...

73
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,051
This. Resolution board.

74
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:24,282
Wow, did your baby draw that?

75
00:03:24,888 --> 00:03:26,516
The glitter is blinding.

76
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,125
I think it's good.
It's gonna be fun.

77
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,720
I recently met Sue,

78
00:03:31,161 --> 00:03:33,721
the office administrator
at Vance Refrigeration.

79
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:36,460
She has this awesome wall
full of fun initiatives

80
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,229
and morale boosters and stuff.

81
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:41,235
Sue just goes for it.
She's awesome.

82
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:44,440
I know Sue,
she's not that great.

83
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,134
And you know her husband's
in a wheelchair, right?

84
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,279
Okay, champagne.
Happy.

85
00:03:51,248 --> 00:03:52,341
Sponge.
Sad.

86
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,575
To soak up my tears.

87
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,283
Gummy bears and gummy worms.

88
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,556
Bears sad, worms happy.
Come on, Erin.

89
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:02,419
Ukuleles. Happy?

90
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,754
Sad. Something to break.

91
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:07,721
Chocolates.
For you, job well done.

92
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:09,530
Thank you.

93
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,298
And two bottles of scotch.

94
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,427
Both sad.

95
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:14,635
And did you get the tickets?

96
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,730
I did, I did indeed.

97
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:19,640
Two front row center
to Paula Poundstone,
live in Poughkeepsie.

98
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,938
Holly's favorite.

99
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:22,841
I hope she doesn't
call us up on stage,
that would suck.

100
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,275
"Hey, you think you
could do my job better?"
"I don't know."

101
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,341
"What's your name?"Michael."

102
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,947
I'm really excited
for Michael either way.

103
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:36,585
Because if Holly
chooses to be with him,
he will be so, so happy.

104
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:40,628
And if not, he'll be
avoiding the biggest
mistake of his life.

105
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,497
Oh, hey, guys.
I'd like to introduce you

106
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,534
to a new little
friend of mine.

107
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,763
His name is New
Year's Resolution Board.

108
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:51,406
Shut up. Hello.

109
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,499
What happened?
Is there a ring?

110
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,568
So, high five me. We're back.

111
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:56,738
To a happy...

112
00:04:57,514 --> 00:05:00,143
Woo! Look at those.
Mittens. Those a present?

113
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,684
Come on.
They're warm.

114
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,652
Those are so fuzzy and warm.

115
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,545
Let me feel those.
Let me feel that.

116
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:07,390
Put her there.
Give me a good firm one.

117
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:08,481
Ooh, that's a good,
firm handshake.

118
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,684
You're hired.

119
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:12,388
Yes, well let's get right
into the Anderson account,
shall we?

120
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:14,192
Okay.
Yes, yes, right away.

121
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,960
Yes, yes. Right away.

122
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,091
Okay.

123
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,636
Hey, hey, hey.
Want me to crank the
thermostat to 90?

124
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:21,638
Smoke her out?
She can't keep those
mittens on forever.

125
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:24,004
Yes. No, what? Stop. Yes.

126
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:29,237
Congrat...

127
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,506
Wow.
Oh.

128
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,879
Oh, my God.
That's it, that's it.

129
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:37,344
Oh, I get it.
Everybody knows
about the ultimatum.

130
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,752
Yes, I told everyone.

131
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:41,086
Ha, ha!

132
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:44,389
Hey, right back at you, bitch.

133
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,194
Happy, happy, happy, happy!

134
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:54,933
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

135
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:57,634
Okay, calm down! Breathe.

136
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm trying.

137
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,173
I said breathe.

138
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:01,336
I'm trying.

139
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:04,006
Wait a second.
Are you listening to music?

140
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,104
What?

141
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,581
Shut that off.

142
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,379
I'm not
listening to the music.

143
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,716
Fine, just go crazy
for a little while.

144
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,224
Looking good.
You're looking good.

145
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,127
I gotcha, I gotcha!

146
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,265
I'm pulling you back!

147
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,429
Michael dance-off!

148
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:27,762
That's nice. That's nice.

149
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:28,896
Go!

150
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,098
Me, okay!

151
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,732
Go!
Oh, yeah!

152
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,436
Nice!
We're gonna calm down later.

153
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,037
I'm doing it.
Oh, yeah!

154
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:38,548
Oh, yeah!
Right there, right there!

155
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,106
Oh, yeah!

156
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,215
Hey, Dwight. I'm
collecting resolution cards.

157
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,278
Not doing that.

158
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:47,346
Why not?

159
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,119
I've achieved plenty,
and there's no
better than the best.

160
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:51,286
Drink less caffeine.

161
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,387
That's a good one, Pam.
Here's mine.

162
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,494
"Learn to cook for one."

163
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,228
Yeah, I love cooking.

164
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:01,032
But I always find
myself throwing out
half the food that I prepare.

165
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:04,131
So I figured it's time
to just start preparing
the right amount of food

166
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,574
for the right number
of people, which is one.

167
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:07,835
Well,
maybe you'll meet someone.

168
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:10,080
No, some people just
don't meet someone.

169
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:12,081
I'm fine with it. Really.

170
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,616
This is not a pity party.

171
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,652
It's not a party at all.
It's just sad.

172
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,452
Angela.
Yes.

173
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:21,019
"Make time for romance."

174
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:23,359
Who's the senator?
My boyfriend.

175
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:25,221
Oh, you mean
the state senator.

176
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,621
I'm sorry, I was confused
'cause you accidentally
wrote "The senator."

177
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:31,200
Wait, wait, wait.
It's that easy?

178
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:33,969
That's not a resolution.
That's just
something I wanna do.

179
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,302
Okay, fine. I can do that.

180
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,809
My resolution is
"Meet a loose woman."

181
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,904
Oh, God.

182
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:47,106
That's a good one.
Yeah?

183
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:48,378
You know what?
That's my new one.

184
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:49,578
I'm taking that one, too.

185
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,880
Awesome.

186
00:07:50,954 --> 00:07:52,650
You know what
you guys should do?

187
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,951
Go to the book store at lunch.

188
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,856
There's tons of cuties
and it's easy to talk to them.

189
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,919
"Hey, what book is that?"

190
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,520
"Cool,
let's hang out tonight."

191
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:01,929
"Sex already? Whoa."

192
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,193
The book store?
It's that easy?

193
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,530
I'll come with you,
show you how it's done.

194
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:06,831
Okay.
I'll drive.

195
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,872
My resolution is to read more.

196
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:10,998
And if someone else
is driving me to
the book store,

197
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,669
I can eat my PB
and J in the car.

198
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,246
2011 is coming up all Darryl.

199
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,616
Hello.
Somebody's got a new phone.

200
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,312
Yeah.
That is neat.

201
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:26,015
I got it for Christmas.
I'm so out of my league here.

202
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,484
E.T. phone Holly.

203
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,224
Holly like phone?

204
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,191
Holly misses old phone.

205
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,322
Why?

206
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:37,856
New phone is confusing,
gets bad reception.

207
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,162
Oh, bummer.

208
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:40,497
Bummer.

209
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,799
Reese's pieces.

210
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,167
Reese's pieces?

211
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:44,605
KELLY: Oh, God. Please stop.

212
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:48,739
I still have my old phone.
This thing, indestructible.

213
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,181
Oh, I should get this.

214
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,212
Hey.

215
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,987
No. Don't go see that one.
I want to see that together.

216
00:09:02,492 --> 00:09:04,188
Yeah, go see that action one.

217
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,221
Okay.

218
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,422
I love you, too.

219
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,999
All right.

220
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,799
Holly doesn't
seem to be engaged,

221
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,136
but she's talking to A.J.
like she is.

222
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,438
I can't figure it out.

223
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:22,845
Do you think
she's already
dating a different A.J.?

224
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,239
I don't think so.

225
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,874
When you broke it off with Roy
did you still tell
him you loved him?

226
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,210
No.
But you did still love him.

227
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:30,776
I'm not gonna have...
Do you love him now?

228
00:09:30,853 --> 00:09:32,185
No!

229
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,714
Just talk to her.

230
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,190
No, she'd just resent me.

231
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:37,523
Or worse,
she would think of
me as her friend.

232
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,324
"Oh, hi, friend."

233
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:40,961
I'll talk to her, Michael.

234
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,225
You think she'd talk to you?

235
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,357
Why wouldn't she?

236
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,664
That's true,
she's really nice.
She'd talk to anybody.

237
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,999
Why don't you bring
Erin to balance you out?

238
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,100
There's a plan.

239
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:54,408
All right, we should
divide up by section.

240
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,445
I will take
Romance and Travel.

241
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,276
I'll take the entirety
of the second floor.

242
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,280
I got that cutie
behind the counter.

243
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:09,152
Well, if you read a lot
you should check
out our e-readers.

244
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,716
They're really neat.

245
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,351
Oh, I work at a paper company.

246
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:14,124
Those things terrify me.

247
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,029
They could put us
out of business,
you know?

248
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,727
Heard those machines
hold, like, 10 books at once.

249
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,367
Actually, it's 10,000.

250
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,036
Holy. What?

251
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:22,705
Let me see that.

252
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,598
So light. Like a croissant.

253
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,337
Hi.
Hi.

254
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:29,039
Welcome.

255
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,672
Let us know if
you need anything.

256
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,442
Thanks.

257
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,642
Why did we pretend
like we work here?

258
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,078
Is that what we were doing?

259
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,347
I don't know...

260
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:39,645
Hey, how'd you do?

261
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,748
Good. Yeah.
Good, real good. Yeah.

262
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,417
I think we kind of nailed it.
Yeah, pretty much.

263
00:10:43,493 --> 00:10:45,894
But, you know,
this place is kind of
tapped out, so let's roll.

264
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:47,627
Cool.
Okay.

265
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:48,892
What'd you get?

266
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:50,227
A book about oceans.

267
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,495
Oh, really?
What else? Let me see.

268
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,160
That's porn.

269
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:56,238
Pornography.
Old lady. Nasty porn.

270
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,334
Follow my lead.

271
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,504
Hey, want some company?

272
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:03,738
Want some company?

273
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:05,278
Oh, sure. Have a seat.

274
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,377
HOLLY:
How were your breaks?

275
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:09,919
Oh, really good.
I went to Portugal.

276
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:11,010
I went to Portugal.

277
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,986
Oh, wow. You went together?

278
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,682
No.
No.

279
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,951
So, I just gotta know.
What's going on
with you and A.J.?

280
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:19,251
Nothing really happened.

281
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,223
I mean,
I know I made a big deal

282
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:22,992
about this whole
New Year's deadline,

283
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,365
but, it came and went
and we're still together.

284
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:26,829
You didn't break up
with A.J. at all?

285
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,168
I mean, not even for a week
to make him buy you a present?

286
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:32,367
It just wasn't fair of me
to give him an ultimatum
in the first place.

287
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,468
The whole thing is
totally my fault.

288
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:37,207
But we're gonna be just fine.
Just fine.

289
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,304
BOTH: Hmm.

290
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,155
Whoa!
Hold on.

291
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,384
I am not going back
until I fulfill my resolution.

292
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,188
Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

293
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,419
DWIGHT: Come on, why not?

294
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,121
I've never been in one before.

295
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,598
I'm tired of being
Mr. Perfect Role
Model all the time.

296
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm telling you, don't do it.

297
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,326
I got nothing
against strip clubs,

298
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:03,396
but I do have
something against them
at noon on a Monday.

299
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,608
The day shift at a strip club?

300
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,575
You can't un-see that.

301
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,041
Well, we can't just
go back. I mean,
we came out to meet women.

302
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,406
Hey, there's a roller
rink across the street.

303
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,707
There's always
chicks at the rink.

304
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:16,012
What kind of chicks
are you gonna meet there?

305
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:18,281
I don't know.
Single moms at
a skating party?

306
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:21,555
Sweet 16, 10-year
reunion parties.

307
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:23,593
Chicks fall down,
need help getting back up.

308
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,594
Roller derby practice.

309
00:12:27,563 --> 00:12:28,587
We're going skating.

310
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,606
The goal of this
meeting is to get

311
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,509
everybody excited
about their resolutions.

312
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:46,739
Who's been good
about their resolution so far?

313
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,480
Erin, tell us about it.

314
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,818
Well, my goal was
to learn a new
word every single day.

315
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:56,050
And I must say that
it is going immensely.

316
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,554
Cool.

317
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:01,325
Here's a little "way
to go" gift from Sabre.

318
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,296
Intercepted.
Hey... Gabe.

319
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,390
Oops-e-doops.

320
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:07,164
Creed, I notice
you don't have
a resolution on the board.

321
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:08,397
What's yours?

322
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,734
I want to do a cartwheel.

323
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,069
But real casual, like.

324
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,006
Not make a big deal out of it.

325
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:16,807
But I know everybody saw it,
just one stunning,
gorgeous cartwheel.

326
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,972
How's it going?

327
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,016
I'm having a little
trouble motivating.

328
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:23,519
One of the hardest parts
about making
resolutions is keeping them.

329
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,913
In fact, most resolutions
are abandoned by February.

330
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:28,716
Or sooner.
Yeah.

331
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,657
It's not a joke.
But that's okay.

332
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,195
Because it's not
about being perfect,
it's about trying.

333
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:36,394
In fact,
why don't we go around
and confess some of the ways

334
00:13:36,466 --> 00:13:38,128
that we've already fudged
on our resolutions?

335
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:42,534
Well, I said that I
would eat more vegetables,
and I haven't yet.

336
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,733
But it's okay.
I still have time.

337
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,673
Since last year I ate none.

338
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:50,678
Okay,
well, my confession is that
today I had a sip of coffee.

339
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,146
But that's fine.
Is it?

340
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:55,049
Yes, because with
all of your support,

341
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:59,020
by this time next year maybe
I'll be down to one
glass of iced tea a week.

342
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,580
Next year? Come on.
I mean, what is the point?

343
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:02,920
What is the point of that?

344
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,687
I made a resolution to floss.
And I did it.

345
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:07,496
12:01, January 1st.

346
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:09,060
Bam! Blood everywhere.

347
00:14:09,398 --> 00:14:11,390
Not all of us are
Michael "Freaking" Scott.

348
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,062
What is wrong with you people?
Can't you stick to anything?

349
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:17,571
Erin, I want you
to go to the kitchen
and get me some vegetables.

350
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,735
Creed, you say you
want to do a cartwheel?
Nothing's stopping you.

351
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:22,673
Come on, old man.
Do a cartwheel!

352
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:24,077
Well, I can't.
I don't know how.

353
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:26,615
You're just going
to somersault around
for the rest of your life.

354
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:29,208
And you know what's gonna be
on your tombstone? "Loser."

355
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:31,020
My tombstone's
already made, thank you.

356
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,248
Just do a cartwheel!

357
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,583
This is all I could find.

358
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:36,782
Eat it.

359
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,888
PAM: You don't have
to do that, Kevin.

360
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,827
Oh, no.
I'm glad this is happening.

361
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:43,056
Thank you, Michael.

362
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,732
Why are you eating stem first?

363
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,462
This is a new food for me.
How else should I eat it?

364
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,536
GABE: The other way.

365
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,103
Can I get some Cheez Whiz?
Or Hollandaise?

366
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:55,804
No, no. No Cheez Whiz,
no Hollandaise,

367
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,538
no chocolate sauce,
just eat it.

368
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,309
Come on,
here comes the airplane.
There you go.

369
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,544
Open, open, into the hangar,
there you go.

370
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,279
PAM: Oh, Michael.
Yeah, eat it.

371
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,147
Put it in your mouth,
and just eat it.

372
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,415
God, I hate it.

373
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,117
I don't care
whether you hate it,
you said you'd do it!

374
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,180
Michael, Michael.
All right.

375
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:11,227
Eat it, eat it!
Oh, my God.

376
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:12,455
You're killing him, Michael.

377
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,697
All right,
all right, all right! Shh!
ANGELA: Michael!

378
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:18,027
Okay, I ate the fluffy part.
Can I be done?

379
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,165
Let me see if
you swallowed it.
Open your mouth.

380
00:15:21,437 --> 00:15:23,633
Under your tongue. Oh, God!

381
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,801
You guys are pathetic.

382
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:32,910
Can I get some
candy or something?

383
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:34,951
No, you can't have any candy!
I'll get him water.

384
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:36,575
PAM: Okay, Michael.
Just settle down.

385
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,513
PAM: Um...

386
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:43,217
Oh, God!

387
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,631
MICHAEL:
Holly Flax.

388
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,030
Yes, Michael?

389
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,398
Not Michael, E.T.

390
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:53,833
What's up?

391
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,636
Well, I just want to talk
about what happened in there.

392
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:00,406
Oh, no, Michael.
I don't want to
talk about it with you.

393
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:03,105
And I'm fine, I just...
I don't want to talk about it.

394
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,272
Okay.

395
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,169
MICHAEL: Holly, come on in.
Thanks for coming.

396
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,545
I thought there should be
an HR rep here for this.

397
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,076
So Kevin and Creed,

398
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:44,984
things got
a little bit intense
in the conference room.

399
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,181
You think?

400
00:16:46,322 --> 00:16:47,483
And I wanted to apologize.

401
00:16:47,556 --> 00:16:49,752
These resolutions
should be about you,

402
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,919
and I made it about me.

403
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:53,189
And it was none of my beeswax.

404
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,389
You were super mean.

405
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:56,360
It was insensitive
and I am sorry.

406
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,895
It was traumatizing, Michael.

407
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:02,132
I wouldn't be surprised
if I never ate
a vegetable again.

408
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:06,738
I really wanted
you to follow through
on your resolutions.

409
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:08,671
The cartwheel, the veggies.

410
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,540
I...
I care about you. Very much.

411
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:16,384
And you loom so
large in my heart

412
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,821
that I crossed the line.

413
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:21,848
Okay, Michael, no offense.

414
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:24,284
But you need to
get your own life.

415
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,028
You're right.

416
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:30,364
And I hope that we
can still be friends.

417
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,335
I don't think I'm
there yet, boss.

418
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,764
Well, I am.
Okay.

419
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,265
All right.

420
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,638
KEVIN: I'm gonna help you.

421
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,107
Okay, okay.

422
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:47,845
Hey, it's just you.
Anything you want to hear?

423
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,077
Um...

424
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,721
Dave Matthews Band.

425
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:54,347
No hits, deep tracks only.

426
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:55,850
Okay.

427
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:58,561
I said, no hits.

428
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:14,139
RYAN: I just feel blocked.
I feel like I'm living...

429
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,576
Hey, Ryan.
Yeah.

430
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:17,704
How's your fart
project coming?

431
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,214
That's real,
real classy, Kevin.

432
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,647
Hey, was it me or
you that just shoved

433
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:22,183
the butt end of
a pound of broccoli

434
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,243
into my mouth
because Michael told me to?

435
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,412
Me.

436
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:26,613
Kevin, don't.

437
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,623
Come on.

438
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,159
Oh, Pam? Soda. Caffeine.

439
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,487
Yeah, just a little.
I have a lot to
deal with today.

440
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:36,429
Well, if you don't
have to do them...

441
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,829
Meredith, what are you doing?
I could be pregnant.

442
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:40,028
Okay, no.

443
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,703
Oh, my resolution was to
get more attention.

444
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:44,001
RYAN: Nope, she's lying.

445
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,769
KEVIN: Hey, Ryan.

446
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,180
One, two, three.

447
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:54,280
I did it. I did a cartwheel.

448
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,850
you!

449
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:56,942
Oh, God!

450
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,009
Okay, that's it.

451
00:18:58,087 --> 00:18:59,077
God!

452
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:07,953
Lesson learned.

453
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,600
What's up?

454
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,169
Hey, where'd you go?

455
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,372
To the arcade.
Oh, cool.

456
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,370
Why, did you meet someone?

457
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,840
Yeah. I did, actually.

458
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,007
His name is Andy.

459
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,512
And he roller
skates like a Greek God.
And you know what?

460
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,674
I kind of like
hanging out with him.

461
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,342
Right on, son.

462
00:19:29,518 --> 00:19:30,986
Gentlemen.

463
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,954
And where did you go?

464
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:34,149
Strip club.

465
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:36,715
I was looking at the strippers
at the strip club.

466
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:38,994
Right.
So that's it, guys?

467
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:41,027
If you want I can
put on the strobe.

468
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,136
ALL: Yeah!

469
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:02,576
Do you want to keep this?

470
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:03,777
No.

471
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,079
Do you want to keep this?

472
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:07,315
Yeah.

473
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:10,720
Do you wanna keep this?

474
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,055
No, you can toss them.

475
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:18,031
My resolution?
I never want to
make Holly cry again.

476
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,393
Unless it's from
laughing too hard.

477
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:24,503
Or making love
too beautifully.

478
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:30,646
HOLLY:
We're gonna be just fine.

479
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,045
You know how
you say something
over and over

480
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,609
and the words
start to sound weird?

481
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:39,583
Going to be just fine.

482
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,921
Just fine,
just fine,
just fine.

483
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:47,586
I just think
we need to cool
things down for a while.

484
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,627
Yeah, a break.

485
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,496
At least until I
get back to Nashua.

486
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,095
Yeah, I'm sure.

487
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,970
Look at where you're going
to be doing the cartwheel.

488
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:03,603
So look where
you're going to be
placing your hand.

489
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,204
So pick a spot.
Mmm-hmm.

490
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:07,014
You ready to do this?
Yes, sir.

491
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,142
You know what?
I'm gonna stay here
as long as it takes.

492
00:21:09,218 --> 00:21:10,777
I really appreciate it.
I'm gonna spot you.

493
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,151
Spot you.

494
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:13,981
Go.

495
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:16,887
I did it!

496
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,650
You did?

497
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:19,717
A perfect cartwheel.

498
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,956
Okay, good!

499
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,526
What a rush! That's
all I had to do all year.

500
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,228
Congratulations.

501
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:29,571
All right.
Well, all right,
see you tomorrow.
