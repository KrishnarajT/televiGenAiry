1
00:00:04,928 --> 00:00:06,487
I got a delivery for you.

2
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:08,131
Leave it at reception.

3
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:11,095
I'm supposed to
deliver this one in person.

4
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:46,399
Clean up on aisle five.

5
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,641
After three years of writing,
one year of shooting,

6
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,837
four years of re-shooting,
and two years of editing,

7
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:57,438
I have finally
completed my movie,

8
00:00:57,514 --> 00:00:59,745
Threat Level Midnight.

9
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,339
Erin, Erin...
Yes?

10
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,465
What are you doing?

11
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:24,666
Guys...

12
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,905
Did you guys know that
our own Michael
Scott has made a movie,

13
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:30,277
and that he maybe
will let us watch it,

14
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,776
but only if
everybody's dying to see it?

15
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,045
That's... Well, don't
put words in my mouth.

16
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:39,751
Threat Level Midnight
is the great lost
film of Michael Scott.

17
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:43,282
We're all in it from,
like, years and years ago.
It's like a home movie.

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,661
Yeah, if Michael
Scott did your home movie.

19
00:01:47,764 --> 00:01:50,632
PAM: Michael screened
a work in progress for us
years ago,

20
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,067
and it didn't go well.

21
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:54,761
We thought it was a comedy.

22
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,137
Everything pointed
to it being a comedy.

23
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:58,197
Yep.

24
00:01:58,275 --> 00:01:59,265
We'd love to see it.

25
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:02,006
Sweet. I will go invite Holly.

26
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:05,706
Okay, everyone, I know
we're really excited to

27
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,717
see this movie
that everybody's in,

28
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:09,946
but we have to remember
that Michael is sensitive.

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,716
So, let's stay positive.

30
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:15,225
And no laughing, no comments,
just positive energy,

31
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,989
and we'll have
a pure fun day, okay?

32
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:19,393
Thanks, Mom.

33
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,291
You never told me
you made a movie.
Mmm-hmm.

34
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,597
It's got action.
It's got heart.
It's got symbolism.

35
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,964
It's got you.
It's got a lot of me.

36
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,766
I can't wait.

37
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:33,802
Ladies and gentlemen,
Threat Level Midnight.

38
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:46,418
NARRATOR: Michael Scarn?
Well, that is
an interesting story.

39
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:53,088
He was once
the best secret
agent in the business.

40
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:00,103
That was years ago.

41
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:05,734
Where is he now?

42
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:09,576
Well, that's also
an interesting story.

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,188
Master Scarn.

44
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,283
Master Scarn!

45
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:23,794
I play Samuel,
Michael Scarn's robot butler.

46
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,453
I wanted Samuel's voice

47
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:27,862
to be like this.

48
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,729
But Michael thought
that Samuel should be

49
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,166
a very advanced android,

50
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:34,329
almost indistinguishable
from a real person.

51
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:36,704
Dwight does not
play a robot.

52
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:39,965
I'm up.

53
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:41,033
It's the President.

54
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,374
He needs you for a mission.

55
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:43,914
Tell him I'm retired.

56
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,379
It's Goldenface.

57
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,146
Goldenface.

58
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:49,743
This makes it personal.

59
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,228
Scarn, you're right on time.

60
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,720
Hail to the chief.

61
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:01,888
I gave up a lot of weekends,

62
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:03,627
because I thought
it would be good
for my daughter

63
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,502
to see a black
man as President,
even in a silly home movie.

64
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:10,666
What a stupid waste of time.

65
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:13,006
It's your old enemy,
Goldenface.

66
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:15,102
He's after
the NHL all-star game.

67
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:18,146
He's hidden a bomb
somewhere in the stadium.
Scarn,

68
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,348
this one is personal for me.

69
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,716
I own the stadium.

70
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:25,017
I can't see it blown up.

71
00:04:25,088 --> 00:04:26,522
It's my retirement plan.

72
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,853
We have to search the stadium.

73
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:29,254
Not so fast.

74
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:31,090
Goldenface has
taken all of the

75
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:32,891
concession stand
workers hostage.

76
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:37,124
Scarn,
will you find these hostages
and save the game?

77
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:40,601
Heads I do it,
tails I don't.

78
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,696
Best out of seven.

79
00:04:44,674 --> 00:04:45,835
Heads.

80
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:50,212
Tails.

81
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:52,746
Heads.

82
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:54,476
Tails.

83
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,077
Heads.

84
00:04:58,855 --> 00:04:59,879
Tails.

85
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:11,265
Looks like there's gonna be
a clean up on aisle five.

86
00:05:17,707 --> 00:05:20,176
NARRATOR: Well,
the hostages were scared.

87
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:23,372
Don't you guys get it?
Nobody's coming for us.

88
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:25,506
GOLDENFACE: Oh,
someone's coming, all right.

89
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:29,383
The only man who would care,
Michael Scarn.

90
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:34,183
See, I'm gonna lure him here,
then I'm gonna kill everybody,

91
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:37,284
then I'm gonna dig
up Scarn's dead wife,

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,761
and I'm gonna
hump her real good.

93
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:42,960
JIM: I did not
love the dialog,

94
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,834
or the character.

95
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:49,930
I took the role to
impress a receptionist,
who will remain nameless.

96
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:52,441
NARRATOR: Well, the all-star
game was three days away.

97
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,876
So, naturally,
it was all sold out.

98
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:57,847
The only way
Scarn was getting in
was in a uniform.

99
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:59,746
Just one problem with that.

100
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:02,684
Scarn didn't know
a hockey stick
from a Slim Jim.

101
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:06,689
So, he went to meet
with the famed trainer,
Cherokee Jack.

102
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:07,985
Mop the ice.

103
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:09,558
I'm not here to
learn how to mop.

104
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:11,127
I'm here to learn
how to play hockey.

105
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:12,320
Mop it.

106
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:28,571
Come on. Come on!

107
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:49,362
Now, take this.

108
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:51,264
What am I
supposed to do with this?

109
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:52,424
Mop.

110
00:06:57,874 --> 00:06:59,866
NARRATOR: Well, Michael Scarn
was quickly becoming

111
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:02,469
one of the hottest
hockey players in the country.

112
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:06,277
Each year,
the National Hockey League
accepts one civilian amateur

113
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:07,908
to play in the all-star game.

114
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:09,714
It's down to the three of you.

115
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:13,314
The final test
is speed skating.

116
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,989
On your marks, get set...

117
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,453
Die.

118
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,520
Nice try, Goldenface.
Except you forgot
one thing, to kill me.

119
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:45,521
Oh, I wasn't
trying to kill you.

120
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:47,784
I was trying to
slow you down.

121
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,790
No!

122
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,124
Oh, by the way...

123
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,526
Yeah?

124
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:56,122
How's your wife doing?

125
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:00,970
Congratulations.

126
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:03,506
Hey, you came in second.
Not bad either, champ.

127
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:05,405
I am so sorry I
have to do this.

128
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:23,759
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

129
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:25,819
I'm intercepting
a name.

130
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,295
Jasmine Windsong.

131
00:08:27,797 --> 00:08:29,789
She works for Goldenface.

132
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:33,564
But what I
can't figure out is,
who is the Funky Cat?

133
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:35,366
Not "who," what.

134
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:37,737
The Funky Cat is the
hippest jazz club in town.

135
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,138
Oh! Oh...

136
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:49,914
He cut the part
where my circuit
board malfunctioned?

137
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:52,649
Then what was the point of
spilling the drink on me?

138
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:59,996
They call me Jasmine Windsong

139
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,123
Bingo.

140
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:06,730
He finished his movie?
No kidding.
Wow, that's great.

141
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:08,499
Yeah, good for him.

142
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,020
The hostages are
under the stadium

143
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:33,024
Check, please.

144
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:36,726
You have to let
us go, Goldenface.
We have families.

145
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,500
Ha! This is gonna show them
that I mean business.

146
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,799
See ya.

147
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:55,482
Far and away the most
expensive shot of the movie,

148
00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:59,182
but it was
integral to the story.

149
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:02,958
It's Scarn!

150
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,524
Sorry about
your friend, Scarn.

151
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,496
The joke's on you,
Goldenface.

152
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,760
That man was
a wanted animal rapist.

153
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,068
We've searched
the whole building,
Goldenface.

154
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:14,001
Where is the bomb?
Hmm?

155
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:16,101
We've searched
the whole building,
Goldenface.

156
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:17,834
Where is the bomb?
Hmm?

157
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:19,705
We've searched the...
Okay.

158
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,336
He said,
"Where is the bomb?"

159
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:23,708
In the puck.

160
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,442
SCARN: But why are you
telling me this?

161
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:29,418
Because I'm going
to kill you, unless

162
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:31,250
you forgive me for
murdering your wife.

163
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,899
Hey, Goldenface.
Yeah?

164
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,367
Go puck yourself.

165
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:48,896
No!

166
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,635
That was not scripted.

167
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:59,107
SCARN:
More Tylenol.

168
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,548
You've already had four.

169
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:02,117
Oh, God!

170
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,147
So good.

171
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:05,448
NURSE: You're lucky
to be alive.

172
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:07,819
It'll take a lot more
than a bullet to the brain,

173
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:11,919
lungs, heart, back and balls
to kill Michael Scarn.

174
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:16,160
Let's just make sure
that everything's
working properly.

175
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:30,871
You just said,
"The bomb is in the puck"?

176
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,040
BOTH: Yes.

177
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:34,209
Is that where you hid
the bomb, Goldenface?

178
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:39,455
But why would you
blow up the stadium?

179
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:41,286
You own the stadium.

180
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:44,486
For the insurance money.
I knew it all along.

181
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,528
You will never
get away with this.

182
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:02,109
SCARN: Where had I gone wrong?

183
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:06,172
All I wanted was to start
a family with my
beautiful wife,

184
00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:10,152
but somewhere along the way,
things got messed up.

185
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,052
NARRATOR: It wasn't easy
for Scarn to admit

186
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:14,020
that he'd lost
his self-confidence.

187
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,624
And he hadn't, of course.

188
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,519
He just wasn't
using it right now.

189
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:19,927
ALL: Mike!

190
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,259
SCARN: Beer me, Billy.

191
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:23,557
You don't look so good.
What's got you down?

192
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:26,159
I got problems, Billy.
Big problems.

193
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:28,831
You got problems?
My TV don't work.

194
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:32,342
I pay $30 a month
for the damn
satellite whats-a-whose-it.

195
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,468
I can't even
get the damn game.

196
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:36,705
Now, you tell me,
what's worse than that?

197
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:38,781
Don't ever change, Billy.

198
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,684
Goldenface is going
to blow up the NHL
all-star game tomorrow.

199
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,715
I see what you
mean about problems.

200
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:49,088
I know what'll cheer you up.

201
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:51,957
That table of
bachelorettes over there
bought you this drink.

202
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:56,863
ALL: Hey.

203
00:12:56,933 --> 00:13:00,893
Ever banged an entire
bachelorette party, baby?

204
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:05,236
Why are you
singling my line out,
like, a million years later?

205
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,107
I'm too depressed
to save the big game, Billy.

206
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:12,080
I'm gonna cheer you up
the only ways I know hows.
Hey, kid,

207
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,046
hit G-9 on the jukebox.

208
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:19,886
No, Billy,
I haven't done that dance
since my wife died.

209
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:22,391
There's a whole
crowd of people out there

210
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,994
who need to learn
how to do the Scarn.

211
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:35,703
Well, my name's Michael Scarn
And I'm here to say

212
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,831
I'm about to do the Scarn
In a major way

213
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,437
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

214
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:46,676
Then you jump to the left
And you shake that hand

215
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,877
You meet new friends
You tie some yarn

216
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:51,011
And that's how
you do the Scarn

217
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,147
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

218
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:55,453
Then you jump to the left
And you shake that hand

219
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:57,619
Meet new friends
Tie that yarn

220
00:13:57,694 --> 00:13:59,663
That's how you do the Scarn

221
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:01,322
You jump to the right
And you shake a hand

222
00:14:01,397 --> 00:14:03,423
Shh. Stop.

223
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,262
Meet new friends
Tie that yarn

224
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,498
That's how you do the Scarn

225
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:11,700
If doing the Scarn is gay,

226
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:14,505
then I'm
the biggest queer on earth!

227
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:17,311
You guys, I think I have...
Sorry.

228
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,611
I'm really sorry.

229
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:22,276
JIM: Hey, hey.
Michael!

230
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:25,811
Michael, I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

231
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:27,288
I think I was just
relieved to see that

232
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:28,857
Michael Scarn got
his confidence back.

233
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:30,052
Yeah, Michael,
the movie's amazing.

234
00:14:30,126 --> 00:14:33,255
It's, like, one of
the best movies I've
ever seen in my life.

235
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:34,854
You should enter
it in festivals.

236
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,126
Or carnivals.
Yeah.

237
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,435
Well, that's
a pretty good reaction.
That's pretty cool, right?

238
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,171
Did you like it?
Did you like that?

239
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,141
Which part?

240
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,236
Okay.

241
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:51,144
All right.
Come on.

242
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:52,546
MICHAEL: No.
Michael.

243
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,049
No, come on!

244
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,651
We have to see the end.

245
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:58,153
No, it's not good enough.
It's not good enough.

246
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:00,417
Some people are
really popping on-screen.

247
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,156
Hey.
Hey.

248
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,959
Good movie.
Mmm.

249
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,361
Good?

250
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,163
Everybody out
there says it's great.

251
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:14,227
I loved it.
Did you?

252
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:15,669
What did you love about it?

253
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:20,005
Um... I loved that you
got to work together
with all your friends.

254
00:15:20,076 --> 00:15:21,100
Mmm-hmm.

255
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:23,373
Isn't that so great
when you can all work
together like that?

256
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:26,314
No, no. Holly,
this isn't Ocean's Eleven,

257
00:15:26,382 --> 00:15:27,714
where you get together
with all your friends,

258
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:30,049
and you just have fun,
and you don't care
about how it turns out.

259
00:15:30,686 --> 00:15:32,587
What'd you really think,
honestly?

260
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:33,748
Um...

261
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,518
Is it...

262
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,856
Is it because you're afraid of
where this is gonna take me?

263
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:41,227
Because, see,
I need you to
keep me grounded.

264
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:44,091
Not worried about that.

265
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,430
This is 11 years, okay?

266
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:51,201
This has been
my dream for 11 years,

267
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:52,970
and if you don't
think it's great,

268
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:55,238
then you're basically saying
you don't believe in my dream.

269
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,475
It's your dream?
You never even
mentioned it before.

270
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:00,779
We talk about
a lot of things, Holly.

271
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,751
You know, I was
eventually going to

272
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:05,880
get around to my dream,
obviously.

273
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:07,287
Eleven years
that I could've been

274
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:08,881
working on "The
Scarn Nebulous."

275
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,359
Well, why do you have to
make a movie at all?

276
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:13,987
Because if I don't
have this, what do I have?
I have nothing.

277
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,764
Really? You can't think
of anything else
that you might have?

278
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,531
I have my book on business,
Somehow I Manage.

279
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:24,638
I have my HBO comedy special,
"Here I Go Again..."

280
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,642
But, you know what?
When I think about it,

281
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,043
when I really think about it,
none of those things

282
00:16:30,112 --> 00:16:32,308
are as real to me
as my movie.

283
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:34,507
I'm real.

284
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:36,743
Yeah, you're
a real pain in the ass.

285
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:38,853
And now, I'm gonna
go watch the movie

286
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:40,388
with people who
think it's great.

287
00:16:40,456 --> 00:16:43,153
And I'm sorry I called
you a pain in the ass.

288
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:45,252
I'm angry, and I love you.

289
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,558
I love you, too.

290
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:52,727
I am a huge Woody Allen fan.

291
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:54,566
Although I've only seen Antz.

292
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:57,732
But I'll tell you something,
what I respect about that man

293
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:59,002
is that when he
was going through

294
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:01,237
all of that stuff that
came out in the press,

295
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,371
about how Antz was just
a rip-off of A Bug's Life,

296
00:17:04,447 --> 00:17:07,940
he stayed true to his films.

297
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:11,181
Or at least
the film that I saw,
which, again, was Antz.

298
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:12,916
Thing is,

299
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:14,753
I thought A Bug's
Life was better,

300
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:17,384
much better than Antz.

301
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,658
Point is, don't listen
to your critics.

302
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,290
Listen to your fans.

303
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:26,993
Who likes Threat
Level Midnight?

304
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:30,672
Okay, well, then who wants
to watch the rest?

305
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,112
Michael, you have to get
to that puck before halftime

306
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,171
or the whole
stadium will explode.

307
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:42,514
I know. It's a good thing
my trainer and mentor
is here to cheer me on.

308
00:17:42,585 --> 00:17:43,746
Cherokee Jack?

309
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:46,618
Michael, he died.

310
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:56,528
This one's for you,
Cherokee Jack.

311
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,601
We filmed this
during an actual

312
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:11,270
Scranton High School
hockey game.

313
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:13,043
They were trying to
qualify for states...

314
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,146
It's fine. It's great.

315
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:18,449
No, no.
Actually, it was
really screwed up because

316
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:20,888
they were trying to qualify.

317
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:23,085
They were disqualified.
They had to forfeit the game.

318
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,153
Undefeated season.
That's why there were
so many people there.

319
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,135
FEMALE HOSTAGE:
Why is your face gold?

320
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:33,863
GOLDENFACE: Why do you care?

321
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:36,371
I'm just making conversation.

322
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:39,068
I worked in a gold factory.

323
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,303
We had a boss who
only cared about money.

324
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:43,175
Hey.
Hey, I'm sorry.

325
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:44,611
It is good.

326
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,147
No, no, it's not.

327
00:18:46,215 --> 00:18:48,207
It's not.

328
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:51,812
But they really seem
to be enjoying it. Come on.

329
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:53,549
MALE HOSTAGE: Please,
Goldenface, let us go!

330
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:03,327
Cherokee Jack.

331
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,959
I want you to take
all your frustrations

332
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:08,504
with women,
the system, with everything,

333
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:10,697
take it out on the puck.

334
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:12,735
All on the puck.

335
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,103
Hey, we got
sports games again.

336
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,703
Oh...

337
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:02,224
Some breakfast for me,
some breakfast for you.

338
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:09,960
Yeah, I guess I did
let him be a robot.

339
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,825
I'll get it.

340
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:13,392
Man, I love being retired.

341
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:15,227
Scarn here.

342
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:17,273
Michael, it's the President.
Hello, sir.

343
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:18,898
I need you for
another mission.

344
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:22,935
Yeah, I'm in.

345
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:28,145
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
isn't the President evil?

346
00:20:28,718 --> 00:20:31,984
Oh, yeah. Yes, he is.

347
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:33,852
No, no, he's doing it
to catch the President.

348
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:36,518
No, no, Dwight,
he's just being stupid.

349
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:41,964
Well, Michael Scarn
was back in the game.

350
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,363
And I bet you're wondering

351
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:47,733
why do I know so much
about Michael Scarn?

352
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:51,296
Well, because
I am Michael Scarn.
