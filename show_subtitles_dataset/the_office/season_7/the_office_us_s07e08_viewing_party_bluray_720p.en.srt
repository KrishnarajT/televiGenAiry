1
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:07,170
They caught
the Scranton Strangler.

2
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:08,237
They trapped him
in his house.

3
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:10,710
FEMALE NEWSCASTER ON COMPUTER:
and then
photographing them,

4
00:00:10,784 --> 00:00:12,047
is believed to be inside.

5
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:15,886
Police have now surrounded
the apartment complex.

6
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:17,218
Police have surrounded.
And we

7
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:19,952
now see what appears to
be a SWAT van pulling up.

8
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:21,518
SWAT, SWAT's arriving.

9
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:23,325
It is unknown if he
is armed with any...

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,160
They should
do that thing
where they play

11
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:27,599
the really good music
to get him to come out.

12
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,565
Ugh! They shouldn't
televise any of this.
It just encourages copycats.

13
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:34,840
Just say copies.
Why do you have to
drag cats into this?

14
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:37,536
Okay, while this is
interesting, we should
get back to work.

15
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:39,337
These standoffs
can last a long time.

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,205
What if it's
another Waco?

17
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,544
It's pronounced "wacko."

18
00:00:42,616 --> 00:00:44,312
Some events
are so newsworthy,

19
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:47,081
so historic,
that you have to stop
everything to watch.

20
00:00:47,254 --> 00:00:50,019
Balloon boy,
Michael Jackson's funeral...

21
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:52,922
Uh, things that,
if you didn't
see them live,

22
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:55,758
you wouldn't really
care that you didn't
see them at all.

23
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:57,828
FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
Coming to you
from the corner of...

24
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:59,729
Columbia Street
and Washington Ave.

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,368
God, when is he
gonna come out?

26
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,904
For what we all
pray is the last...

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,532
ANDY: I bet he's wishing
he had a hybrid, right?

28
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:08,131
Sixty miles
to the gallon
in the city!

29
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:11,273
No, I bet he's wishing
he was strangling someone.

30
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:12,505
Okay, that's our street.

31
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,413
That's our street.
He's going down
our street.

32
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,540
Come on, everybody.

33
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:17,011
KEVIN: Go. Go, go, go.

34
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,710
There it is.
There it is.

35
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:21,947
I saw it.
ANDY: Where? Where?

36
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:23,513
I saw it. It's gone.

37
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,580
ANDY: Oh!

38
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:26,718
He went right by.

39
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:28,989
You missed it.
You missed it.

40
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:33,329
MICHAEL: "Grandpa,
where were you the day

41
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,301
"the Scranton Strangler
was caught?"

42
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:39,805
Well, I was there, kiddo.
I was there.

43
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:44,333
And I'll tell you what,

44
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:50,143
you go sell these
and buy yourself
a nice spaceship.

45
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:13,167
Michael.

46
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:15,275
Walk with me.

47
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:16,705
Gabe and I are
having a party,

48
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:18,678
and everyone's invited,
and it's at his apartment.

49
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,338
And we're gonna watch Glee.
Glee? What is Glee?

50
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:21,847
Some sort of
television program?

51
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,941
Jim, I need
that thing, stat.

52
00:02:24,017 --> 00:02:25,508
Okay.
ERIN: Yeah,
it's a TV show.

53
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:27,986
Dwight. Signing.

54
00:02:28,054 --> 00:02:30,250
I don't have time for
parties. I don't have
time for TV shows.

55
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:32,087
Stanley,
what time is that thing
that I have to do?

56
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,219
I...
Cancel it.
Are you still here?

57
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:36,720
Oh, it's just...
It's our first
party together.

58
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,958
So...
Mmm-mmm!

59
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:41,023
Did you hear
what I said?

60
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,066
I'm a very busy man.
I don't have time
for your TV show.

61
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:45,538
Okay, sorry.
I'm joking.

62
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:48,032
Wait, which...
I'm joking.

63
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,205
I'm kidding around.

64
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:52,178
I'm not actually angry.

65
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:56,378
I'm not busy at all.
I'm not doing anything.

66
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,441
And I know what Glee is.
I am a total Gleek.

67
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:00,619
Oh, me too.
You know who my
favorite character is?

68
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:02,278
The invalid.

69
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:04,050
Yes, I'd love to
come to your party.

70
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:05,581
Oh, my gosh.

71
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,026
I don't know
if Michael likes
Gabe that much,

72
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:09,995
but there's
this thing on Glee
called mash-up,

73
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:13,659
where two things
that don't go together
make one great song.

74
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,465
Take Gabe, take Michael,
you make "Gaymike."

75
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:19,262
Best friends.

76
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:20,565
No, really?

77
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,833
Is there time
to change this?
That show...

78
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,040
I mean,
first they say
that Mr. Schue

79
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:26,704
doesn't know
anything about
choreography,

80
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:28,376
and then, like,
three episodes later,

81
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,349
he's this fantastic
choreographer.

82
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:31,407
Pick a lane, people.

83
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,243
And what was with
Jesse's sudden turn

84
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,016
on Rachel between
Dream On and Funk?

85
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:36,716
Where the heck
did that come from?

86
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,726
Honestly,
that show, it's just...
It's irresponsible.

87
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,553
Are you going?

88
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,761
Not because I want to.

89
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:48,565
Of all feelings,
to base a show
around glee?

90
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:50,931
Thirst. Now that's
a show I'd watch.

91
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:53,770
I would watch that.

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,933
Tonight might be
a convenient night

93
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
for us to have
some intercourse.

94
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:01,644
You're having a party
at Gabe's apartment?
Mmm-hmm.

95
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:03,479
I'd love it if
you were there.
You would?

96
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,412
You and Michael
are always the
life of the party.

97
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:10,254
Try and keep me
from coming.

98
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:12,053
Why would I keep
you from coming?

99
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:15,328
Try and hide it,
I will track
this party down.

100
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:16,988
Why would I hide it?

101
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,656
Kevin.

102
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,292
Hey. You going tonight?

103
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:23,428
Yes, I am. Are you?

104
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:25,569
Yeah. You got to go
to the boss's party, right?

105
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,629
Mmm-hmm.

106
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:29,801
What? No, Gabe...
Gabe is not the boss.

107
00:04:30,744 --> 00:04:32,610
No, he's not the boss.

108
00:04:33,246 --> 00:04:34,646
Why did you just
say he was the boss?

109
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:37,543
'Cause you're the boss.

110
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:40,787
Guys, do you consider
Gabe to be the boss?

111
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:46,523
It's a make-your-own-pizza
night.

112
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:47,583
MICHAEL: Okay.

113
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:49,721
Isn't Gabe's
place so nice?
Uh-huh.

114
00:04:49,796 --> 00:04:51,662
Look at the size
of those wine glasses,
Michael.

115
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,723
They're big.

116
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:56,802
Those posters used
to be real French ads.

117
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,929
All right.

118
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:00,802
So, these are your
cheeses, your hams,

119
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:03,139
your sausages,
your herbs and
your vegetables.

120
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,106
Here's what's been done.
Start creating.

121
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:07,904
Sometimes it helps
to think of a part
of the world

122
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:10,177
and then make...
Okay. Okay. Okay.

123
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,481
Gabe likes to
entertain a lot,

124
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:16,512
and he cooks in an oven,
and all that jazz.

125
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,149
I just have
a different lifestyle.

126
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:20,625
They have these
bags of vegetables

127
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:22,959
that steam right
inside their own bag.

128
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,789
So, I'll get a glass
of sangria,

129
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,457
sit down in front
of the TV,

130
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,365
my bag of vegetables...

131
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:31,067
Before you know it,
I'm ready for bed.

132
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:32,528
Okay.

133
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,772
You don't really
toss the dough.

134
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:36,500
Try to destroy
the old ways, Gabe.

135
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:38,306
I will not let you.

136
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:43,383
So, welcome
to my man cave.

137
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:47,811
I did my senior
year abroad in Japan.
Best year of my life.

138
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:48,945
You play?

139
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:51,581
I like to create
soundscapes.

140
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:56,062
Imagine one instant of
a song expanded to be
the size of the universe.

141
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:57,620
I can't even do that.

142
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:01,795
She's up. Great.

143
00:06:02,135 --> 00:06:03,831
Cece is reverse cycling,

144
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:06,771
which means she
sleeps all day,
and she's up all night,

145
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,004
which basically means
I'm up all day,
and I'm up all night.

146
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:14,776
And if it doesn't stop soon,
I am gonna be up all night.

147
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:20,115
The show's starting.
The show's starting.

148
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,119
The show's starting.

149
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:25,682
Show's starting.

150
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,258
FINN: All right,
let's gather around.

151
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:31,186
Who's that?

152
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:32,254
KELLY: Finn.

153
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:34,293
Who's that?
Rachel.

154
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,569
Okay. Which one's Glee?

155
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:39,367
You have to stop.

156
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,998
Where's Michael?
Where's Michael?

157
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:42,406
We can't start
without Michael.

158
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:47,243
Oh, here he is.
Oh, yay, and let
the show begin.

159
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:50,073
GABE: That's a little loud.

160
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:54,549
Well, actually, I think
it's not loud enough. May I?

161
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,584
Excuse me.
Thank you, sir.

162
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:59,021
There you go.
It's Glee, right?

163
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:00,424
Rock and roll.

164
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:01,961
Turn it up to 11.

165
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:03,223
Come on, Michael.

166
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:05,265
Spinal cord.

167
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:06,864
Some of us are trying
to have a conversation.

168
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,933
Well, some of us
are trying to...

169
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:10,493
I'll just turn
the captions on.

170
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:13,102
Well, I will turn
the volume up.

171
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:15,000
That's for the other box.

172
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,010
Okay.

173
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:26,044
Okay.

174
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,919
Here's what
we're gonna do.

175
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:31,480
Right down the hall
is a bedroom.

176
00:07:31,558 --> 00:07:33,993
All the real Glee fans
are gonna go down the hall

177
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,756
to the real Glee
party in the bedroom.

178
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,422
Follow me

179
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:39,363
where we can crank it.

180
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:44,331
What's your angle?
That woman.

181
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:46,066
She's been in
a couple of episodes
of Friday Night Lights.

182
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,163
You know what?
I'm so confused.

183
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,438
Is this a Glee watching
party or is this
a Glee pausing party?

184
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,445
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Because we keep stopping it

185
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:53,775
to get a history
lesson about
television...

186
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:54,837
OSCAR: I didn't
know the rules.

187
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:56,542
There. It's on, it's on.

188
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,617
I didn't read
the rule book.

189
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,844
Hey, Michael.

190
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:04,848
Maybe you should try going
in the other room again.

191
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:08,119
You can have my seat.
It's closer to the TV.

192
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:09,184
It'll seem louder.

193
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,289
Pam, I have a loaded gun
in my desk at work.

194
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,762
And if I ever start
acting like that
weenie, Gabe,

195
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:16,996
I want you to
take that gun,

196
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,868
and I want you
to shoot me,
like, 100 times

197
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:20,839
in the groin
till I'm dead, okay?

198
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,474
You have a gun
in your desk?

199
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,135
Somewhere.

200
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:27,976
Hey. Marantz tube
stereo from the 1970s!

201
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,774
I respect that.
I respect that a lot.

202
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:35,281
The five Chinese
virility herbs.

203
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,551
No kidding.
This is powdered
seahorse.

204
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:40,156
They say that 15
Chinese soldiers

205
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:42,923
fought off the entire
army of Genghis Khan
just using this stuff.

206
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:45,488
You know what they say...
No, what?

207
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:49,168
What is this,
samurai woodcuts? Yup.

208
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:51,059
Pretty erotic.

209
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:52,628
Hmm. Yeah.

210
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:56,108
Better men than Gabe
have tried to be my boss.

211
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:58,438
David got fired.

212
00:08:58,511 --> 00:09:00,707
Charles got fired.
Jan went crazy.

213
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,814
Ed Truck,
who I liked,
got decapitated.

214
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:04,873
Michael.
Yes.

215
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:07,420
I find it
absolutely disgraceful

216
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,353
that no one
followed you in here
for your walk-out.

217
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:12,617
I took the liberty of
making a list of everyone
who didn't follow you in here.

218
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:14,751
Jim, Oscar, Creed,

219
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:18,021
me, at first... Kelly...
Maybe I should go.

220
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,192
Are you gonna
quiet that baby
or do I have to?

221
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:36,077
In the Schrute family,
the youngest child
always raises the others.

222
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:38,208
I've been raising
children since
I was a baby.

223
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,150
Take a shot.

224
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,188
Oh, thanks.

225
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:50,629
So much Asian stuff!

226
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,894
I wonder if there's
a guy in China right now

227
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:55,265
looking at
a bunch of our stuff.

228
00:09:55,902 --> 00:09:57,302
Why does Erin
like Gabe?

229
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:01,541
Andy, look,

230
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:04,669
all I know is,
if I was a girl
and I had to choose

231
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:07,578
between a tall
dude who loved Asia

232
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:12,318
and a you-looking dude
who loved sweaters
and wearing sweaters,

233
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,281
I'd choose you.

234
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:18,254
That's really nice.
Thank you.

235
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:20,192
And I'd blow your mind.

236
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,234
OSCAR: Jim, what
are you doing?

237
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:36,469
It's a commercial break,
so I just wanted
to check the scores.

238
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,532
Flip it back, please.

239
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,805
Okay.

240
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,506
The show's back on.
What happened?

241
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,077
We were behind.

242
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:46,445
Go to the recorded version.

243
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:48,144
Oh, my God.
What song was that?

244
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,780
I wasn't recording it.
What?

245
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:51,757
What song was it?

246
00:10:51,824 --> 00:10:52,951
Wait, why do you
have to record it?

247
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,328
Right now is why, Erin.
We're living it.

248
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:56,787
Start recording now.
Jim.

249
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,529
Okay, they did
Blinded by the Light,

250
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:02,398
and they did it with
an actual blind guy.

251
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:06,195
Was it worth it, Jim?
'Cause we missed it.

252
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:11,005
If I could get her
sleeping normally,
I would get my life back.

253
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:12,768
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?

254
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:14,207
I can't even
talk about it.

255
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:15,814
You know, it's not
really necessary for me

256
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:17,373
to sit here
holding her all night.

257
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,850
Just go to
Gabe's refrigerator,
get a lump of suet,

258
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,913
or any kind of
congealed animal
fat will do, really.

259
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,619
Tie a piece of string to it,
tie the other end to her toe,

260
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:28,457
pop the suet
in her mouth,

261
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,325
she'll be happy for hours.

262
00:11:31,331 --> 00:11:33,163
I kind of doubt
Gabe has suet.

263
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,659
Really?

264
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:38,432
Well, then here we are.

265
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:39,528
Michael.

266
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,771
Gabe is making
the pigs in a blanket,

267
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,743
and he kind of
needs some help,

268
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:46,905
so he was wondering
if you could help him.

269
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:59,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Phyllis Vance.

270
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,326
Is that White Diamonds
by Elizabeth Taylor?

271
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,627
You know your perfumes.

272
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,796
My nanny used
to wear that.

273
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:11,334
I just ate an
entire seahorse.

274
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:13,998
I have to admit,
I did not think
it was gonna work,

275
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,336
but it's totally working.

276
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:18,275
I feel exactly
like a seahorse.

277
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:26,375
Look who I found.

278
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:28,648
Yeah, well, I wasn't
very hard to find.

279
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:30,117
Let's go ahead
and wash your hands.

280
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,186
Is this the same dough
that you used for
the pizza crust?

281
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,295
Yeah. Waste not, right?

282
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:40,490
So, these are pizza dogs.
These aren't
pigs in a blanket,

283
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,823
per se.

284
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:44,736
Michael knows
everything there is
to know about snacks.

285
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:45,794
Well.

286
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,431
Gabe was born in 1982.

287
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,232
He was the longest
baby in the hospital.

288
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:50,708
He's the longest
baby in this room.

289
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:54,004
What's the longest thing
you've ever seen?

290
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,104
For me,
it was the tail
from a jet...

291
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:56,204
Erin, you don't have to...

292
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:57,977
Yeah, you know what,
Erin, you do have to.
Michael,

293
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:00,781
you are making this
harder than it has to be.

294
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,148
That's what she said.

295
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:11,887
Hey.

296
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:13,259
PAM: It's a miracle.

297
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:15,767
She loves him.

298
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,470
I don't know
about "love."

299
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:20,297
She loves me.

300
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,805
Outside. My car.
Two minutes.

301
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:28,813
All right. Something's
come up. I gotta go.

302
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:29,871
No, no, no,
she'll wake up.

303
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:31,006
No, I have
something to do.

304
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:33,086
I know what you have to do.
Please stay with Cece.

305
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:38,586
Dwight,
I've always considered us
to be very good friends.

306
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:39,956
Great friends.

307
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,153
Remember your concussion?

308
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:43,160
I do,

309
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:44,390
but you married
my worst enemy.

310
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:46,433
I know.
Well, I think
enemy's a strong word,

311
00:13:46,566 --> 00:13:48,364
'cause I think we have
a really charming
back-and-forth...

312
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:49,766
Enough.

313
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:56,936
I will require
beer and pizza
to think this over.

314
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:58,735
Absolutely.
From Jim.

315
00:13:58,811 --> 00:13:59,801
Well, I don't
think that's...

316
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,246
Do it.

317
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:03,977
What kind of pizza
would you like?

318
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:07,018
Surprise me. No.

319
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:09,378
Pepperoni.

320
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,785
Okay.

321
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:17,592
All right.

322
00:14:17,697 --> 00:14:20,394
And the winner is,
by two votes, Sam and...

323
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,502
What's going on?

324
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:31,373
Hey, Creed.
Do you read Chinese?

325
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:32,601
Better than English.

326
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:34,670
What does this say?

327
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:48,683
Hello, UPS, still waiting
on that five minutes
with Erin I ordered.

328
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,161
Oh, never mind,
it's here.

329
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:53,366
Well, if it isn't
the belle of the ball.

330
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:56,793
You throw
a lovely party, milady.

331
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:59,398
Are you having
a good time?

332
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:01,304
Did you wear
my favorite outfit
on purpose?

333
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:02,364
Andy, you look awful.

334
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:06,072
You're four seasons
in a day.

335
00:15:07,713 --> 00:15:10,842
You got the autumn
thing going on.

336
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:12,783
But if you put on baby...

337
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:17,413
But if you put
on a blue...

338
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,760
It's springtime
in the Rockies.

339
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:26,959
Are you all right?
No!

340
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:29,968
Mmm-mmm.
Insert it in my mouth.

341
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,163
Okay, that's not
gonna make your

342
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:32,933
pizza-eating experience
any better, trust me.

343
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:33,995
Oh, try me.

344
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:37,066
Jim, just don't
think of it as
degrading.

345
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,772
Think of it as you happen
to be moving the pizza

346
00:15:40,112 --> 00:15:42,809
six inches this way,
and he happens
to be biting it.

347
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:44,851
I'd prefer for him to
think of it as degrading.

348
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:45,907
Okay.

349
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:50,885
Crust first.

350
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,819
Okay. Now the beer.

351
00:15:58,497 --> 00:15:59,487
Beer me, Jim.

352
00:16:03,436 --> 00:16:05,803
Gentle.

353
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,465
Mmm, mmm.

354
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:11,871
Now I've got to
go meet Angela.

355
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:13,810
What? No, wait.
You said you
were gonna help us.

356
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,006
I have a legal
obligation to Angela,
okay?

357
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,312
She needs to be serviced.

358
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:19,545
You need to stop talking.
Oh, God.

359
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:20,951
Oh, come on.

360
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,488
Can we stop
the fake prissy act?

361
00:16:22,555 --> 00:16:23,545
Join the real world.

362
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,182
Sex contracts exist, okay?

363
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:26,953
Okay, fine, there
must be some way

364
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:28,551
to get out of it,
even just for tonight.

365
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:30,153
Yeah, sure.
Jim can go see her.

366
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:32,187
Okay.
You've been with
a blonde before?

367
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:33,288
It's the big leagues.

368
00:16:33,432 --> 00:16:34,627
I'm going home,
and I'm taking my baby.

369
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,532
No, no, don't.

370
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:37,695
I will go
talk to Angela.

371
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,368
She is in heat.

372
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:40,497
She will eat
your face off.

373
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:43,607
The reverse cycling
ends tonight.

374
00:16:46,979 --> 00:16:48,208
A single piece of
pepperoni, please.

375
00:16:48,514 --> 00:16:49,948
I'm not...

376
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:58,950
What are you doing?

377
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:03,395
I wanted to eat
a pig in a blanket
in a blanket.

378
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:14,065
PHYLLIS: Are you all right?

379
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:16,542
Erin likes Gabe.

380
00:17:16,642 --> 00:17:17,905
I know.

381
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:19,809
I thought you two
were nice together.

382
00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:21,745
Do you think
that they've ever...

383
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:22,804
Made love?

384
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,181
I don't know.

385
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,850
Well, girls tell each
other things, right?

386
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,257
I'll see what
I can find out.

387
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:36,351
Where you been?

388
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:38,053
I just went out
for a walk.

389
00:17:38,364 --> 00:17:39,662
Cable's out.

390
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:41,428
What? Really?

391
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:42,694
That stinks.

392
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:43,929
It's still on upstairs.

393
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:47,106
What does that mean?
Party's over?
Everybody leaves?

394
00:17:47,306 --> 00:17:48,296
CREED: Are you sure?

395
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:52,809
Hey,
Puck and Finn worked it out,
and the solo is now a duet.

396
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:54,312
Are you kidding me?
No.

397
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,439
Now, that's going on.
Yep.

398
00:17:56,182 --> 00:17:58,310
KEVIN: I can't believe
we're missing that.

399
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:00,853
Boy, I wish
I could see that.

400
00:18:01,787 --> 00:18:03,221
You know what?
I have an idea.

401
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:04,683
I don't know if
it's gonna work,

402
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:07,090
but let me give
it this... Okay.

403
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,149
I'm gonna
give it a shot.

404
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,526
Please, Michael,
just make the Glee happen.

405
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:11,620
Good luck, Michael.

406
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:12,995
Erin.

407
00:18:13,065 --> 00:18:15,933
So, how long have you
two been going out now?

408
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,560
Oh, like three months.

409
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:19,604
I imagine things are
starting to heat up.

410
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:20,995
I don't know.

411
00:18:21,073 --> 00:18:22,598
Of course, you don't
want to rush things.

412
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:25,668
I mean, the anticipation
can be so exquisite.

413
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:27,946
Bob and I
took our time.

414
00:18:28,013 --> 00:18:30,573
The first time we
saw each other naked,
we didn't even make love.

415
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:34,313
We just stared at each other
until we fell asleep.

416
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:35,513
It was magical.

417
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:38,219
I have to go, Phyllis.
Really magical.

418
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,359
Hey in there.
It's me, Pam.

419
00:18:42,428 --> 00:18:43,726
It's not Dwight.
Don't think it's Dwight.

420
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,689
What are you doing here?

421
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:48,291
I know you and Dwight
have this weird deal.

422
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,297
He sent me out here
to see if you
could postpone.

423
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,402
Are you authorized
to do this?

424
00:18:53,472 --> 00:18:55,600
Yes. I have been
so authorized.

425
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,808
Okay, well, tell him
that we'll do this
tomorrow night instead.

426
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:01,870
Okay.
Wait, Pam. Pam.

427
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:05,843
How did he seem?
You know, like, did
he seem disappointed?

428
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,954
You know, there are
a lot of guys out there

429
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:10,387
who would just love

430
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:13,618
and appreciate a woman...
You know what,
Pam, just save it.

431
00:19:18,464 --> 00:19:19,488
You did this?

432
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:22,033
No, I was just check...
Yes, I did. Yes. Yes.

433
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:23,091
Why won't you like him?

434
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:25,138
What is there to like?
He's just...

435
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:30,636
He's a weird, little,
skeevy guy with no waist.

436
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:32,371
Why do you care
whether we like
him or not?

437
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:34,174
I care if you like him.

438
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:36,106
Why? I'm not
your father.

439
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:52,255
All right.

440
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:53,526
Okay.
Go to your room.

441
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,190
What?

442
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:56,997
Go to your room,
young lady.

443
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:03,942
I'm not going
to my room.

444
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,136
You listen to me.

445
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:08,306
You listen good.

446
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:12,408
You are not to see
that boy anymore.

447
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:13,711
You listen to me.

448
00:20:13,786 --> 00:20:15,778
You are not to
tell me what to do.

449
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:17,790
As long as you are
living under this roof,

450
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,052
you are going
to do what I say.

451
00:20:19,158 --> 00:20:20,387
I hate your roof.

452
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,518
Do not raise
your voice to me.

453
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,459
I'll raise it all I want.
I'll raise the roof.

454
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,327
I will pull
this car over.

455
00:20:25,397 --> 00:20:27,423
I hate it.
I hate your car.

456
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,730
See you, Oscar.

457
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:35,701
If you break that girl's
heart, I will kill you.

458
00:20:37,076 --> 00:20:38,066
It's just a figure
of speech.

459
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:41,043
But seriously, if you
break that girl's heart,

460
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:43,878
I will literally kill you
and your entire family.

461
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:46,316
Gabe, just go
and have fun with Erin,

462
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:48,286
but not too much fun.

463
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:52,217
That girl's gonna
turn my hair gray.

464
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:55,319
What happened?

465
00:20:56,762 --> 00:20:59,493
I accidentally
ate some seahorses.

466
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:01,965
How much?

467
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,295
I don't know.
It's powdered, so...

468
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:08,270
Like, four or five,
I don't know.

469
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,010
I've got just the thing.

470
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:20,386
This one is called
"Earthrise on the Moon."

471
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:22,714
üNEW AGE

472
00:21:24,556 --> 00:21:26,252
That's so beautiful.
