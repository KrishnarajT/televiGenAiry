1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,874
Look at that, huh? Nice!

2
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:05,671
I love cycling.

3
00:00:05,748 --> 00:00:07,545
Andy, I feel like
a tourist in my own city.

4
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:09,107
I literally can't wait
to wake up every morning.

5
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:10,980
Okay.
She is a beaut.

6
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:13,488
Can't beat a horse.
A horse is a bike
that pedals itself.

7
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,682
Yes, it is.

8
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:15,815
Look at that, smooth roll.

9
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,189
Yeah.
KEVIN: You got it!

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,318
Lance Armstrong's bike.

11
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:19,383
Yes!

12
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:22,556
His ass was on
that seat? All right!
KEVIN: Nice.

13
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,224
No, Meredith, it's
not his actual bicycle.

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,928
But it is the same
exact model he uses.

15
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:28,833
I'm on Sheryl Crow's
side in that whole thing,

16
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:30,634
so I feel really
weird right now.

17
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:32,072
PAM: Michael!
MICHAEL: Oh, God!

18
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:35,234
Yes, I can ride a bike.

19
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:37,939
I take spinning classes
three times a month.

20
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:40,038
I think I know
how to ride a bike.

21
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:41,548
Are you sure you once
knew how to do this?

22
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:42,915
I did, yes!

23
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:46,854
I had those extra
wheels on the back
that support you.

24
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,686
Michael!
Michael!

25
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,016
ALL:
Michael! Michael!

26
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:51,082
Michael! Michael!

27
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,252
Michael! Michael!

28
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:53,352
Michael! Yeah!

29
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,453
All right!
PAM: Yeah!

30
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,519
Just steer more now.

31
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:56,622
Oh, my God!

32
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,223
Not the car!
No, no.

33
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:04,834
You never forget.

34
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,464
How do I look?

35
00:01:31,534 --> 00:01:32,831
Amazing.
How do I look?

36
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,294
Normal. Ugly.

37
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:37,803
Well, I do the best
with what I've got.

38
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:39,671
Let's go.
All right.

39
00:01:40,576 --> 00:01:44,012
Wait, wait, wait, wait for me.
It's weird if I
come in slightly after.

40
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:48,081
We have a big meeting
with the chief buyer
for Frames Select, Steve Nash.

41
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,119
He's not "the" Steve Nash.
He's...

42
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:52,211
He's big, though.
He's kind of like
Scranton's Steve Nash.

43
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:54,779
Will you stop trying
to put it in terms
you think they'll understand?

44
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:55,881
It's condescending.

45
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:57,619
I'm not doing that.
I'm just explaining.

46
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:00,254
And who is this
"the" Steve Nash?

47
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:02,464
Phoenix Suns' point guard?

48
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:03,897
No.
No? Nothing?

49
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:05,866
No, Mr. Jock Hipster.

50
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:08,665
Well, I'm neither of
those things, so...

51
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:10,928
Oh ho.

52
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,037
Libby Dirketts got married.

53
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:15,907
Big, red mazel tov
to the Libster.

54
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:17,501
Ooh.

55
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,549
It says here Dan Becker
fell off the side
of Kilimanjaro

56
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:21,913
in a climbing accident.

57
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:23,913
It appears Dan's
Sherpa survived

58
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:25,613
to tell the tale...
Oh, my God!

59
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,049
What? Is Dan okay?

60
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,782
No, he died.

61
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,450
It's Broccoli Rob.

62
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,687
You know this guy.
I showed you his
picture on Facebook.

63
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:34,487
Yes.

64
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:39,160
"Some Vermont-based alums
can hear
'Broccoli' Rob Blatt, '96,

65
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:42,500
"in the state milk lobby's
new milk awareness song
Calci-yum,

66
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,665
"featuring
Phish's Trey Anastasio.

67
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,403
"Says Broccoli,
'Trey and I had a ton
of fun in the studio,

68
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:49,001
"'and I think you can
hear it in the song."'

69
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:50,841
Oh, that's great news
for your friend.

70
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:53,247
Yeah. Yeah. It's great.

71
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:56,342
You know, I forget about milk.
This is a terrific reminder.

72
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,521
I was the artsy musical one.

73
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,458
In Here Comes Treble,
I had four solos,
Broccoli Rob had three.

74
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:07,757
Right?

75
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,636
Go tell her we're here. You're
good with receptionists.
Ha.

76
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:19,436
Dwight.

77
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,472
Crap.

78
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:28,340
Danny Cordray
is the worst.

79
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:29,749
Well, by worst,
you mean the best.

80
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,684
The best salesman ever.

81
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,449
He works for Osprey
Paper over in Throop,

82
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,491
steals more clients
from Dunder Mifflin
than anyone.

83
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,185
So the situation
is the worst.

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,659
Also, he slept with Pam.

85
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:40,218
No, he didn't.

86
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,260
Tell them.
Nothing happened.

87
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:49,429
We went on a couple of dates.
He never called me again.

88
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:52,167
What? He never called you?
I thought you said
it just fizzled.

89
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,732
That's fizzling.
I mean, someone has
to start the fizzle.

90
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:56,073
Yeah, I thought
you started it.

91
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:57,976
No, I liked him.

92
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:00,038
For a couple of days.

93
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,640
Four years ago.

94
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:05,080
You know I have
a kid with you, right?

95
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:06,416
Aah!

96
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,691
I'm gonna
intimidate him.
Okay?

97
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,784
Okay, great.

98
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,488
I'm just gonna watch.
Watch this.

99
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:16,726
So anyway, she says,
"That is the biggest
penis I have ever seen."

100
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,027
And I said, "I know.

101
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,091
"That's why I brought you
to the penis museum,

102
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:23,661
"where tickets are $1,000."
Well, hello, Danny.

103
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:26,708
Hey, Dwight.
Good to see you. Jim, hey.

104
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:27,902
How are you?
I'm good.

105
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,342
What are you doing?

106
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:30,743
Well, I'm just here
for the coffee.

107
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,047
Like hell you are.
Dwight!

108
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:35,178
He's not just here
for the coffee, Jim.
Wake up.

109
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,080
Brainstorming
session is now open.

110
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:41,749
Anyone has an idea...
Hold on.

111
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,793
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hello?

112
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:47,996
Hey, it's Jim.
Listen, this is important.
Are you busy?

113
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,656
Oh, hey. No,
I'm not busy.
What's up?

114
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:51,461
You are busy!
We're in a meeting!
What?

115
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:53,627
It's Jim, okay? Yes.

116
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:54,829
Listen, you gotta
get over here,

117
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:55,996
'cause we're
pitching Steve Nash

118
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,403
and Danny Cordray's here.

119
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,334
You need the big guns, yes?

120
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:00,841
Yes.
What'd he say?

121
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,775
What did he say?
The big gun thing. Stop.

122
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,245
I will see you in 10.
Bye! Hold tight.

123
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:09,412
Well, I know
a lot of you thought

124
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:11,146
that my sales
days were behind me.

125
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,346
And, to be honest,
so did I.

126
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,387
And the only reason
I got out of the sales game

127
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,187
was to be reluctantly
called back in.

128
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,994
You don't look reluctant,
Michael. You look
really eager.

129
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:23,691
No, I don't have
time for this.
Are you kidding me?

130
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:26,098
PAM: You don't?
No! Okay. All right.

131
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,797
Knockity-knock,
Don't knock back

132
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,842
Just kidding, you can knock.
It's your office.
Do you have a minute?

133
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:36,575
I'm very busy with
time-sensitive work.

134
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:39,541
Not to go all
Sherlock Holmes on you,

135
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:41,173
but I can tell by
the reflection in your glasses

136
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,582
that you're entering points
into weightwatchers. Com.

137
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:46,754
If you don't enter
them immediately,
you forget.

138
00:05:47,623 --> 00:05:48,612
What?

139
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:51,854
I'm starting a band,
and I need you on keyboards.

140
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:53,121
Nah!

141
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:54,421
I play for pleasure.

142
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:55,891
This is for pleasure.

143
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:57,656
Wouldn't enjoy that.

144
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:58,891
I'm willing to pay you.

145
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:00,660
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

146
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,465
How much?
60 bucks a session.

147
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:04,062
That's crazy money.

148
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,129
I'll take 40.

149
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:06,196
Yes!

150
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,009
There he is.

151
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:11,905
Oh, no, that's a male model.

152
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,949
No, that's him.
That...

153
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,544
Hello.

154
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,347
Michael Scott,
Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

155
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,548
Danny Cordray, Osprey Paper.

156
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:21,681
Nice to meet you.

157
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,551
Three of you
guys for one sale?

158
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:26,094
Yeah, well...
We call it overkill.

159
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,096
Why am I telling
you my strategy?

160
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:30,390
Well, whatever works for you.

161
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:31,960
Anyway, all right.
All right.

162
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:33,194
Good to see you guys.
Nice to meet you.

163
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:34,361
Goodbye.

164
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,564
I could swear that
guy was a male model.

165
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,663
He's ready for you.

166
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,729
Oh! Thank you.

167
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:41,038
All right.
On the count of three,
it's show time.

168
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:42,701
Ready, one, two...
No, I'm not doing that.

169
00:06:42,812 --> 00:06:44,211
I've been in show time
mode since breakfast.

170
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,747
You're not?
Okay, all right,
just forget it then.

171
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,680
Show time!
It's show time!

172
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,684
Never mind. Let's go.

173
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:52,277
When I knock on your door,
you know who it is.

174
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:53,583
It's Michael Scott.

175
00:06:53,656 --> 00:06:55,317
We've been
together forever, and...

176
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:57,382
Michael,
I appreciate everything

177
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,519
that Dunder Mifflin has
done for this company.

178
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:02,428
You know what? You are
having some problems
with your loading dock.

179
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:06,332
Are you not? All right,
we're going to deliver
to you on weekends.

180
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:07,930
That's very generous, but...

181
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:09,869
And you know what
else we're gonna do?

182
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:11,236
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

183
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:14,037
We are going to offer
you our paper at cost.

184
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,202
I know.

185
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:16,909
I could get in a lot
of trouble for this,

186
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:17,968
so you'd better
shake my hand right now.

187
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:19,036
He's not kidding.

188
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,104
Shake it, shake it!

189
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:21,274
Michael, I'm going
with Danny.

190
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,539
Oh.

191
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:24,109
Thanks for coming in.

192
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:25,854
Okay. Thank you.

193
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:27,081
Thank you.

194
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:30,825
Jim talked too much.
No, I didn't.

195
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:32,724
Yes, you did.
Stop it. Just stop it.

196
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:36,094
We did what we
should have done.
We just got bested.

197
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,095
Why is there
a door close button

198
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,499
if it doesn't
even close the door?

199
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,472
How do I feel
about losing the sale?

200
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,169
It's like if Michael Phelps
came out of retirement,

201
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:51,577
jumped in the pool,
belly-flopped and drowned.

202
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:54,243
You know who we
always lose out to?

203
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:56,648
Staples, the big guys...

204
00:07:56,986 --> 00:08:00,513
Osprey?
They're a small company.
They're smaller than we are.

205
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:03,422
What's our excuse?
How do we combat this guy?

206
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,953
Stanley, how do we combat him?

207
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,085
We sell better?

208
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,924
Okay. You know what?

209
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:10,830
You clearly don't care,
so why don't you just leave?

210
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,024
I would like to stay.
This pertains to me.

211
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,899
Why don't you go outside

212
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,438
and take a shot of insulin
and have a nap, okay?

213
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,440
Why do you always
assume I have diabetes?

214
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:21,203
I don't know.
Your frame, your build.

215
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:22,642
Why don't you have
a glass of apple juice

216
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,010
and tell me
you're not a diabetic?

217
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:26,946
See? I could tell
by the sound you made

218
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:28,381
when you stood up
that you have...

219
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:29,850
Okay. Yes, Phyllis?

220
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,045
I could try to seduce him.

221
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,485
Oh, my God!

222
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,955
I know how we can
learn his tricks.

223
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:38,749
What I'm about to show you
is of the utmost secrecy.

224
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,918
Is that your office?

225
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:41,985
Yes, Jim.

226
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,328
And with a little tweaking,
it becomes a different office.

227
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,699
We lure Danny to it
and watch him sell.
PHYLLIS: Oh.

228
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,465
I'm out of here.
This is weird.

229
00:08:49,538 --> 00:08:51,597
You know what this is?
This is a stinger.

230
00:08:51,674 --> 00:08:53,141
A what?

231
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:54,301
Like the movie.

232
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:56,241
I think you mean The Sting.

233
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:58,075
Paul Newman, Robert Redford.
They're bank robbers?

234
00:08:58,147 --> 00:08:59,341
Nope. Different movie.
It's called The Stinger.

235
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:00,746
The Sting.

236
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,419
Your 2:00.

237
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:08,747
Thanks, hon.

238
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,016
Meredith was
the perfect choice

239
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,186
to play the head
of the company.

240
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:15,287
Her lunch break
lined up with our
appointment with Danny,

241
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:17,662
and... That's it.

242
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,701
That's really all
we were looking for.

243
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,393
Danny Cordray.
It's great to meet you.

244
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,937
Meredith Van Helsing.
Pleased to meet you.

245
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:24,666
Meredith Van Helsing?

246
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,298
Van Helsing was
a respected professor

247
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,706
before he was
a vampire killer.

248
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:29,745
Okay. But what is
he more famous for?
Shh.

249
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,638
Hey! That's my mug.

250
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:35,115
You know this
isn't real TV, right?

251
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:36,617
Yes.

252
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:40,049
Please, Mr. President

253
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,114
If you wanna
Give hope a whirl

254
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:45,956
Bring our troops
Home safe and sound

255
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:48,087
Says this little girl

256
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,633
Please, Mr. President

257
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:53,494
Wait a second,
wait a second,
wait a second.

258
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:56,561
So, the song is
from the point of view
of a little girl?

259
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,229
Yeah.
But you're singing it.

260
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,797
Yeah. But I'm
using my falsetto.

261
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,569
No, that's not a good idea.
I don't see it as
a very good song.

262
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,374
Yeah, well, it'd
sound a lot better

263
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:06,141
if you actually
sang with some soul.

264
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:08,210
I never sing with soul.
That's a lie.

265
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,409
I could sing it.

266
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,745
I just was hoping to
maybe save your voice

267
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:13,812
in case we did
a novelty song
about frogs.

268
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:17,092
But my voice is unique.
Like Bob Dylan.

269
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,619
Okay, three-way argument

270
00:10:18,694 --> 00:10:20,423
between a drummer,
a keyboardist,

271
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,157
and the front man,
lead singer.

272
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,766
Wonder who's
gonna win this one.

273
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,062
Two, three, four...

274
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,203
I'm gonna take off my coat,
if you don't mind.

275
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:31,540
It's just a bit warm in here.

276
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:35,542
Hello!

277
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:37,101
No, no, no. Don't.

278
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,170
People can't keep
their true natures
hidden for long,

279
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:41,011
and this guy is
smoldering like
a tire fire.

280
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,107
Testify.

281
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,481
Okay, he's not
that good-Iooking.

282
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:44,644
I don't understand
why everybody's...

283
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,051
Yeah, he is that
good-Iooking. Okay?

284
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:47,383
He's very, very handsome.

285
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:49,856
That's a great set of
shoulders you got there.

286
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,189
What is that, genetics?

287
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:53,319
Creatine?

288
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:55,554
Sorry.

289
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,297
Yeah.
Pull it together,
all right?

290
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,164
Stop looking at him.

291
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,567
I'm sorry.

292
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,401
You're here to
sell me some paper.

293
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:09,535
Well, actually,
no, Miss Van Helsing,
that's not why I'm here.

294
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:13,446
I'm here to meet you,
see if we'd be a,
you know, good fit.

295
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,607
What do you mean?

296
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:18,244
Oh, my God!
He's making her sell to him.

297
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,519
Bring our troops
Home safe and sound

298
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,649
Says this little girl

299
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,655
Okay. Honest
feedback time.
Oscar.

300
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:30,059
That's pandering.
And it makes me think
you think I'm stupid.

301
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,167
But do you think
it could be famous?

302
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,633
Like in a car
commercial or something?

303
00:11:33,836 --> 00:11:35,167
Not really.

304
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,330
It's kind of weird that
a grown man is singing

305
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,465
from the point of
view of a little girl.
Mmm-hmm.

306
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,032
I feel like I can see
someone ice skating to it,

307
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,942
you know,
like in the Olympics.

308
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:48,609
I don't think
they usually skate
to such bad songs.

309
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:51,548
Rude. And not helpful.

310
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,554
Well, I really,
really, really liked it.

311
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,491
Well, that really
bums me out.

312
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,786
You're welcome.

313
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:01,624
Well, you should think of
this as a first date.

314
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,961
And I think it's
going very well.
How about you?

315
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,496
Real well.

316
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:06,556
Uh...

317
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:08,863
Feels more like
a third date to me.

318
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,599
There you go!

319
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,506
Stay...
Shut up and let me do this!

320
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:18,836
You know,
what is with this desk
keeping us so far apart?

321
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:20,711
I've never been a desk man.

322
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:24,446
Always traveling on the road.
Come on... Why not? Uh?

323
00:12:25,554 --> 00:12:26,919
Well, we'll get this...

324
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:32,160
Oh, man.
So, what's your drink?

325
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:34,792
You a vodka man? Me, too.

326
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:37,126
We gotta get someone else
in there right now.

327
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,099
You're an exec at
Pennsylvania Solartech.

328
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:40,294
That sounds fake.

329
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,393
What do you mean?
I told you.

330
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,301
You're an exec at
Stark Industries,

331
00:12:43,372 --> 00:12:44,805
a corporation you
inherited from your father.

332
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:46,272
Will you stop?
Here's the story.

333
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:48,071
They need Meredith
somewhere else ASAP, okay?

334
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:49,201
Okay.
So you're taking over.

335
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:50,973
You just gotta
get her out of there
as soon as you can.

336
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:52,604
I can do that.
Then what?

337
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:53,773
Then make him pitch to you.

338
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:54,907
You gotta see what he's got.
Yes.

339
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,383
Exactly. You
can do this.
Okay, and remember.

340
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,646
You're not gay.

341
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,880
Stop it.
It's gonna be great.

342
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:01,889
Listen,
if anything else happens,
just roll with it.

343
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,248
Meredith, I...

344
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,316
Manuel.

345
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:09,956
This is Manuel,
my cleaning man.
He doesn't speak any English.

346
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,602
Manuel, cleano el window.

347
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:18,897
Give me the...

348
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:19,963
Who else we got?

349
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:25,110
Okay. You're a young
hotshot from
Stark Industries.

350
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,205
You've just
bought this company.
Meredith is fired.

351
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,716
It's a whole new regime.
He's gotta pitch to you now.

352
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:31,719
Okay, Stark Industries
isn't real.

353
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:32,947
I run Google.

354
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,751
Larry and Sergey brought me...
Great. Sounds awesome.

355
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:36,518
Just have him pitch to you.
Don't let us down.

356
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,157
Will do. Won't do.

357
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,588
Yeah, sure.

358
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:40,992
You smell like a Scorpio.

359
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,222
This is Esteban,
another cleaning man.

360
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,597
He doesn't speak
English either.

361
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:48,636
Esteban, el flooro.

362
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,773
You know what?
I may have parked my
car in a compact space,

363
00:13:58,847 --> 00:14:00,474
and I hate when I see
others do that, so...

364
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,141
Danny, I feel
a real connection to you,

365
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,445
and I got to get real.

366
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,508
JIM: No. No, no, no.

367
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:05,575
MICHAEL: No, no, no, no, no!

368
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:06,814
I'm going in! I'm going in!
Michael!

369
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,322
No, Michael, stop it!
No!

370
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,857
Stop, stop! Oh, my God!

371
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,450
Okay. Stop it,
stop it, stop it.

372
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:15,122
Gross! Stop it,
please. Everybody stop.

373
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:16,720
Michael Scott.

374
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,857
I said stop.

375
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:20,930
Okay, Danny,

376
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,901
this is not
Pennsylvania Solartech.

377
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:24,996
This is Dunder
Mifflin Paper Company.

378
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,405
This is Meredith Palmer.

379
00:14:26,508 --> 00:14:27,998
Pleased to meet you.
Don't... Stay away from him.

380
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,705
Please, just leave.
Get out of here.
Go. Forever.

381
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:31,970
Hmm.

382
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:35,278
I owe you a most sincere
and humble apology.

383
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:38,353
We were trying to watch you
to see your sales technique

384
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,354
so we could stop losing
so many clients to you.

385
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:41,916
Watch from where?

386
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,514
A surveillance
room next to this one.

387
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:46,527
Okay, so you set up
this fake company,

388
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,826
then you hired
this homeless woman
to impersonate an executive,

389
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:53,666
to spy on me
so that you could
copy my sales technique.

390
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:55,733
Yes. And it's the sincerest
form of flattery.

391
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:57,362
Or crazy.

392
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,799
Well...
I'm gonna go.

393
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,967
Okay. You know what,
it wasn't just me.

394
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,302
Jim and Dwight
are behind that wall

395
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,979
in the surveillance room,
and it was their plan,
as well.

396
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:07,242
No!
No, no, no, no.

397
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:08,744
Well, then, yeah.
All right, hey!

398
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:10,751
Good luck, guys!

399
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:12,252
Seems like you got
a great operation here.

400
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,812
No, we don't.
Here's... Here's my point.

401
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,250
Danny, listen,
you have to understand

402
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:20,056
that we are not
normally like this.

403
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,859
We just... We wanted
to know your tricks.

404
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:24,728
What do you mean, tricks?
There's no tricks, man.

405
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,325
I'm just a good salesman.
You wanna copy that?
You can't copy that!

406
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:30,860
You are, you are. You are!
Stop it, stop it. Stop.

407
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:31,997
You are a good salesman.

408
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,473
And because of that

409
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:36,805
I want you to work for me.

410
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,779
Sure. You seem like a fun,
professional guy.

411
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,105
So you will.
No!

412
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:41,740
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold on.

413
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,786
Hold on. Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Wait.

414
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,450
Danny, I want you
to look at me.

415
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:50,081
Do you want your
life to be better

416
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,820
or to be worse or
to stay the same?

417
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,628
Get out of my way.
Answer the question.

418
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,162
Do you want
a better life, Danny?

419
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,027
I swear to God,
I'm gonna hit you.

420
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,864
I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry. I'm not...

421
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,267
It's just, I'm very
upset right now.
I know.

422
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,395
I'm very upset!
I know, I know.

423
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:06,964
Do you want more freedom,
less freedom,
or to stay the same?

424
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,771
More freedom.
I can give you more money.

425
00:16:11,113 --> 00:16:12,546
There's your better life.

426
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,775
I can let you come
and go as you please.

427
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,579
There's your freedom.

428
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:18,051
And you already
know Dunder Mifflin

429
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,281
has the best service
and the best prices.

430
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,346
But you beat us anyway.

431
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:26,520
Can you imagine
how well you would
do selling our stuff?

432
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:32,400
Everyone, may I
have your attention?

433
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:35,630
I would like to introduce you
to Mr. Danny Cordray.

434
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:39,839
He's going to be
joining us as our
new traveling salesman.

435
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,407
Say hello to Danny!

436
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,203
me.

437
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,109
Okay. You know what?

438
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,080
No. No.

439
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:50,778
This is not some sort
of construction site,
or all of Italy

440
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:52,945
where you can just go around
treating people like meat.

441
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,621
We are to respect him.

442
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:58,991
I respect him
because he
reminds me of somebody.

443
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,289
Can anybody guess who that is?

444
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,618
Josh Duhamel.

445
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:02,755
Yeah, I can see that!

446
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:05,492
No. No. No.
Somebody in this office.

447
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:07,660
He's like
a better-Iooking Andy.

448
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:08,960
Thanks, Kevin.

449
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:10,834
No. Me. Right?

450
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,235
Sort of like a little,
younger version of me.

451
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,837
It's hard to judge
ourselves accurately,
isn't it?

452
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:17,970
Michael.
Yes.

453
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:19,707
Can I talk to you
about something?
No, you may not.

454
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,339
It's about this
very announcement
you just made.

455
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,043
I said no.
Michael...

456
00:17:23,118 --> 00:17:24,449
Michael, I think
you really want to
talk to him.

457
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,215
Okay, let's... All right,
all right. Let's talk.

458
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,381
Please don't
let him leave.
Don't leave.

459
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:29,481
Got you.

460
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:30,923
You hired him?

461
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:32,017
Guys, let me
ask you something.

462
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,824
Do you want your life
to be better or worse
or stay the same?

463
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,022
ALL: Stay the same.

464
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,999
Okay. Well, get ready,
'cause it's gonna get better.

465
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,894
It's not gonna get better.
He's gonna steal
all of our clients.

466
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,460
No. No. Wrong.

467
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,267
He would have
stolen your clients,

468
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,035
but you know what?
He can't now.

469
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,134
This guy used to
steal sales from us.

470
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,337
Now he's going to
steal sales for us.

471
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,478
Where's he gonna sit?
There's no more seats.

472
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:55,209
He doesn't need to sit.
He's a traveling salesman.

473
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,151
Look, I am not going
to exclude good people
from our staff

474
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,415
simply because they
are threatening to you.

475
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,288
And unless you have
a better argument
than that,

476
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:03,688
I suggest you leave.

477
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,348
Yeah.

478
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,555
Where's he gonna park?
There's no more
reserved parking spots.

479
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,858
Goodbye!

480
00:18:13,969 --> 00:18:15,800
Songs about truth.
Yeah.

481
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:17,600
What's something
you really care about?

482
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:19,833
Reverse snobbery.

483
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,066
More universal.

484
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,971
Sometimes I feel like
life has passed me by.

485
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,215
Couldn't get
Out of bed today

486
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,013
Wish the alarm clock
Would go away

487
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:33,111
Nice!

488
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:34,553
Holy crap.
Are you kidding me?

489
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,988
You just made that...
That's amazing.

490
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:37,116
Go ahead.

491
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,591
Which me am I
Gonna be today?

492
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,959
Which me am I
Gonna be today?

493
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,396
I got a closet full of mes
Ha ha!

494
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,368
Am I gonna be the happy me?

495
00:18:48,804 --> 00:18:50,863
Or the me that stinks?

496
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:53,764
Oh, my gosh.
We're almost
out of time.

497
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,207
How much for
another half hour?

498
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:57,174
Don't worry about it.

499
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,173
Wait. Seriously?
Yeah.

500
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,881
So we're just, like,
jamming as friends?

501
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:05,550
One, two, three, hit it.

502
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:07,752
Closet full of mes...

503
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:12,189
Oh, you know, funny,
your wife and I
went on a few dates.

504
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,824
Did you?
Yeah, way, way, way back.

505
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:16,227
I'm just kidding.
She told me about it.

506
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:18,823
Good. She was not into me.

507
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,299
Oh.
Obviously.

508
00:19:20,469 --> 00:19:21,766
I don't even think
she called me back.

509
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,004
You snubbed her.
Dwight, please.

510
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:27,735
Let me handle this, Jim.
Drop the act, Cordray. Okay?

511
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,401
We all know that
you probably thought

512
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:32,914
that Pam was too "meh"
or thin without being toned.

513
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,273
But I wanna
tell you something.

514
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,715
She is one of the plain,
hearty women of Scranton

515
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,650
that make this city great.

516
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,347
And so what if she
doesn't wear makeup?

517
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:41,616
I wear makeup.

518
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,090
We like her better that way!
And you steal clients,
don't you?

519
00:19:44,526 --> 00:19:45,618
Don't you?

520
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,319
Okay, that's different.

521
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:48,920
"That's different," is it?

522
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:51,056
Okay, thief.

523
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:54,159
You better check your
things, people. In fact,
where are my keys?

524
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:58,105
Oh. They're in my pocket.
False alarm.

525
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,166
Okay.

526
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:04,869
So you're gonna
be working here.

527
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:06,836
Uh...

528
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:08,608
I mean... Yeah.

529
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,508
Welcome aboard.

530
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,516
Thank you.

531
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,750
Hey, crazy. Um...

532
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:19,726
So, that's it?
You're just... You're fine?

533
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:23,126
It's after 5:00, Jim.
I'm not gonna take this home.

534
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:25,790
Pleasure.

535
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:27,361
Thanks.

536
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,462
This morning, Danny Cordray
stole a sale from me.
So what do I do?

537
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:32,696
I go out and I
steal Danny Cordray.

538
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,937
The sale that mattered,
I made. Boom.

539
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:37,444
Funny thing about it,
we don't even need him.

540
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:39,707
We already have
Packer on the road.

541
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,076
Crap. I forgot about Packer.

542
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:49,820
Star's in her eyes,
tongue full of flies

543
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:52,724
Would you like
to share my pad?

544
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:56,560
Croak, croak, croak,
Bullfrog in love

545
00:20:57,532 --> 00:21:00,126
Croak, croak, croak,
Bullfrog in love

546
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:01,328
And I gave her the croak

547
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:02,893
That meant I love you

548
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:06,030
I'll be your croak monsieur

549
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:08,473
I'll be your croak madame

550
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,704
Your mama might've said
That bullfrogs are dogs

551
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,373
But I'm here to
Tell you that I'm a frog

552
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:16,474
Come and sit on my log,
You little pollywog

553
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:18,849
I find you
absolutely ribbitting!

554
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,548
Croak, croak, croak,
Bullfrog in love

555
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:24,217
Croak, croak, croak,
Bullfrog in love

556
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:25,520
Croak
Ribbit

557
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:27,824
Scoopty splash

558
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:29,158
Nice.
