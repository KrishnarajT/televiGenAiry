1
00:00:01,365 --> 00:00:05,496
It is 6:00 a.m.,
and Deangelo and I
are about to go house to house

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:08,198
to give everybody
their Dundies
nomination certificate.

3
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:10,103
Just like the Oscars.
Yes.

4
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:11,732
And this happens every year?

5
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:13,674
Every year this happens.
Okay. Every year.

6
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:15,838
You have a lot
to learn, my friend.

7
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,611
Well, you know,
why don't we try it,

8
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:21,242
and if it goes good,
it'll be part of my tradition.

9
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:23,947
Why are you even saying that?
You're going to love it.

10
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:26,417
Here we go.

11
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:29,719
This way, this way.

12
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:34,090
Okay.
Nice house.

13
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:36,324
Surprise!
Congratulations!

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,493
Yep.

15
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:41,499
You and Pam have
both been nominated
for Dundie Awards.

16
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:42,728
Okay.

17
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:44,569
Here we go.

18
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,371
MICHAEL: Have Pam come down.
No, no, she's not here.

19
00:00:46,543 --> 00:00:47,567
PAM: What's going on?

20
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:48,735
Stay in bed.

21
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:50,708
Congratulations!
Stanley, we love you.

22
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:54,808
Have you lost your mind?
Get off my property
before I call the police.

23
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:57,719
All right, we got it. Good.
Okay.

24
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:58,811
Leave it at the door? Okay.

25
00:00:58,889 --> 00:00:59,913
Yeah, that's fine.

26
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:08,097
Hey, Toby, you suck!

27
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,229
Is this an employee of ours?

28
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:14,465
Why are...
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

29
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:17,271
I've never seen this
place in the daylight.

30
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:19,740
This reminds me
of Katrina.

31
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:24,145
Here we go.
All right.

32
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:27,582
Got it? Are we set? Hello?

33
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,543
Oh.
Uh-oh.

34
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,055
I'm so busted. Walk of shame.

35
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:36,058
Do you usually leave
your door unlocked?
And ajar?

36
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:39,789
Nice. I got
a Dundie nomination. Wow.

37
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:41,422
Yes, that's right.
Yes, you did.

38
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:43,467
No big deal.
Congratulations, Meredith.

39
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:44,933
Well, we should head out.

40
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,196
No, no, no,
you've got to stay.

41
00:01:46,269 --> 00:01:48,966
No, no, no, I have
Vienna sausages
and I have napkins.

42
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,008
Let me fix you breakfast.

43
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,843
I'm not going in there.

44
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,104
Go.

45
00:02:13,363 --> 00:02:14,456
Good morning, Erin.

46
00:02:14,598 --> 00:02:15,725
Oh, hey, didn't see you.

47
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:17,161
Any big plans for tonight?

48
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:18,293
I don't know.

49
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:21,361
Maybe volunteer at
the women's shelter,
go to bed.

50
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:23,130
Or, I don't know,

51
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:26,372
maybe I'm going
to the Dundies!

52
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:30,843
You are getting
so funny. Very good.

53
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:35,716
The Dundies are my baby,
and they need to go on.

54
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:41,489
When Larry King died,
they didn't just
cancel his show.

55
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:45,017
They got Pierce Morgan
to come in and do his show,

56
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:48,156
and that way, Larry lives on.

57
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,826
Anything can happen
at the Dundies.

58
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:56,303
They're like
the Golden Globes,
but less mean.

59
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,339
And I just want us to
all have a good time.

60
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,774
Just a little
announcement, folks.

61
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:02,312
Remember, the Dundies
is a black tie affair.

62
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:04,146
Black tie optional.

63
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:06,482
Every day is
black tie optional.

64
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,214
FYI, tonight we will
be hosting at Louie Volpe's.

65
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:11,880
Nice.
I love their breadsticks.

66
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,548
Oh, their breadsticks
are like crack.

67
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,249
I love when
people say "like crack"

68
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,953
who've obviously
never done crack.

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,061
Well, the breadsticks
are like what then, Ryan?

70
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,030
What can I use?
I don't know.
Something from your world.

71
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:22,656
"The breadsticks are
like scrapbooking."

72
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:24,928
You're right, you're right.
No, I'm a middle-class fraud.

73
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,560
MICHAEL: Shh.
Okay, okay, okay.

74
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:29,936
Everybody's right.
They're like
breadsticks on steroids.

75
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,565
Right?
Yeah, that's great.

76
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:33,868
So, as you know,
the Dundies are my legacy,

77
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:35,674
so I'm going to need
to train a replacement.

78
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:38,408
So this year,
I have decided
to have a co-host.

79
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:40,878
And that person is

80
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:45,212
Deangelo!

81
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:49,552
Always the Padawan,
never the Jedi.

82
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:53,624
Thank you, Michael.
Uh, but I will have to pass.

83
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:56,192
Think of it as
part of your training.

84
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,700
I'm not much
of a performer.

85
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,395
Unless you count
singing in the shower.

86
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:03,039
Boy, okay.

87
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:05,439
Okay, well, we'll work on it.

88
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:07,803
Look,
I'm very, very bad.

89
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:09,346
Very bad.
You are doing it.

90
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:11,938
Guys, I want you to help us
work on some banter.

91
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:13,980
Yes! I love banter.

92
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,040
Good.

93
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:17,314
But I hate witty banter.
MICHAEL: Here we go.

94
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:21,655
So, Deangelo, you and I
have a lot in common.

95
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,023
You lost 200 pounds,
and I lose my car
keys every morning.

96
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,325
That is true. We do
share some similarities.

97
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,063
I know how we can fix
one of those problems.

98
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:34,468
For me, it was
portion control.

99
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:36,369
For you, you need a keychain.

100
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:38,999
Maybe hang them on the...
Okay, okay, you know what?

101
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:40,509
I didn't actually
lose my keys.

102
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:41,801
Okay, so this
did not happen.

103
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:42,969
M'kay.

104
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:46,175
There needs to be
what you call a "rat-tat-tat."

105
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:48,808
And right now,
it's all "rat" and no "tat."

106
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:49,978
Ryan, come on up here.

107
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:51,646
Deangelo, if you'd just...
Do you mind?

108
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:53,656
Tap Deangelo out.
Because if I can see it.

109
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:54,918
Just watch this. Okay.

110
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:57,087
Ryan, how are you today?

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,321
Why don't you
ask my therapist?

112
00:04:58,461 --> 00:04:59,656
My mom certainly
pays her enough.

113
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,130
There you go! Lovely!

114
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,630
Regis and Kelly. Nice.

115
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:07,296
Use that as an inspiration.
Just be funny.

116
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:10,564
Uh... You, sir.
Are we having fun tonight?

117
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:12,400
Having a great time.
Thanks, yeah.
Oh, good.

118
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:14,038
Where were you
on September 11th?

119
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,170
No, gosh. No, no.

120
00:05:16,413 --> 00:05:18,211
MICHAEL: Stop, stop.
DEANGELO: This is so weird.

121
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,580
If I'm conducting a meeting,
good to go.

122
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,916
But if I think of
it as a performance,
I fall apart, obviously.

123
00:05:24,254 --> 00:05:25,779
Why don't you think
of hosting the Dundies

124
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:27,447
like you're just
running a meeting?

125
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:30,619
No, no, no, this is
the performance of your life.

126
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,853
Why don't you just privately,
in your own head,
think of it like a meeting?

127
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:36,057
Jim, please, no loopholes.

128
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,464
Mike, why do you
have to control

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,932
how he perceives
it in his mind?

130
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:41,061
This is my last Dundies ever.

131
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:45,074
If I want mind control
over him, is that
too much to ask?

132
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,941
Good. Good, good. Good.

133
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:53,643
Now, tell me
something terrible

134
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:54,912
that happened in
your childhood.

135
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:58,114
When I was very young,
my mother divorced my father

136
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:00,419
and I had to go to court
and choose between them.

137
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:03,357
Too personal.
I don't want to
hear about that stuff.

138
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:04,951
Let's try this. Put this on.

139
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:10,791
I am going to turn this on
and turn the volume
all the way up,

140
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:15,135
so you can't... That's right,
you're not going to be
able to hear yourself.

141
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:17,970
Read this, and it's
going to sound perfect.

142
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,443
"The Dundies are all
about coming together,

143
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:26,506
"and recognizing
the indomitability
of the human spirit!"

144
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,108
Say it with an accent!

145
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,776
The Dundies!

146
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,955
"The Dundies!"
The Dundies!

147
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:33,490
I just don't
understand the desire

148
00:06:33,623 --> 00:06:35,091
to push sweet
potato fries on me.

149
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:36,182
I just want regular fries.

150
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,249
Yeah.

151
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,650
Oh!

152
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:42,191
PAM: Hey, Erin,
everything okay?

153
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:43,800
Get away from the car,
or he's going to see you.

154
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,196
Who's going to see us?

155
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,564
Just get in.
Get in. Just get in.

156
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,864
JIM: Get in the car?

157
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:52,035
Please, sorry,
get in.

158
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:54,441
I'm sorry,
sorry, sorry.

159
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:55,774
What's wrong?

160
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:58,413
I eat lunch in the car now.
It's my alone time.

161
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:01,844
It's just nice
to have some time
away from Gabe.

162
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:04,119
Why don't you
want to each lunch
with your boyfriend?

163
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:06,918
I really don't like
spending time with him.

164
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,559
Don't you think it's better
to tell him the truth now?

165
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,990
You know,
rather than waste
more of his time?

166
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,831
I think I'm going to go.
What?

167
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:19,529
I think you got this.
Okay.

168
00:07:19,602 --> 00:07:21,195
Okay? All right.
Yeah.

169
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:22,967
Okay. Thank you, Jim.
Feel better.

170
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:26,776
I'm sorry, that just
wasn't interesting to me.

171
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:30,640
I can't just dump him, Pam.
I'm not like you.

172
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:32,045
I can't be mean.

173
00:07:32,115 --> 00:07:33,378
Wait, when am I...

174
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:37,143
You just have to be
clear and firm, you know.

175
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,679
Just tell him
you don't love him.
Just be honest with him.

176
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:46,059
Hi.
Appalling.

177
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:48,555
Eyesore.

178
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:51,023
Surprisingly adequate.

179
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:55,933
Okay, everyone,
the festivities
commence in four seconds!

180
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,901
Deangelo,
Jo's on the phone for you.

181
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:00,936
Hello?

182
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,605
Deangelo, we're in
serious horse manure here.

183
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,206
The Dundies are tonight,
and we ain't got no host.

184
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:07,782
Oh, no.

185
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:09,752
Luckily, I have
someone for you.

186
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,247
Billy Crystal?
Better.

187
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:12,613
Neil Patrick Harris?

188
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,954
He's in Little Shop
of Horrors on Broadway.

189
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:16,856
Right.
No, we need
Michael Scott,

190
00:08:16,926 --> 00:08:20,795
the best darn Dundies host
both sides of the Mississippi.

191
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:25,097
I've got to
find Michael Scott.

192
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:29,733
And then I've got to
get him to the Dundies.

193
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,934
Hey, can you help me
find Michael Scott, Angela?

194
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:36,842
My boyfriend can.
He's a state senator.

195
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:37,937
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:41,280
Oh, no, he can't help
because that title
has no meaning.

197
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:44,349
Try Jim, Deangelo.
He'll be able to help.

198
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:45,649
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

199
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,991
Jim, do you know
where I can
find Michael Scott?

200
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:52,884
Oh, I totally don't know
where Michael is, dude.

201
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,056
Hey, you want to
listen to some records?

202
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:57,798
No one's listening to me.
I'm running out of time.

203
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:01,065
Well, what are you
talking about?

204
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:07,273
I've fallen
and I can't get up.

205
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:10,074
Maybe I just need to
look into my heart.

206
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:13,275
Deangelo,
where is Michael Scott?

207
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:15,978
I'm here.
In a good way.

208
00:09:16,052 --> 00:09:17,418
I've been here
the whole time.

209
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:22,053
The analytical part of
me wants to examine it.

210
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,923
But I know it has no content.

211
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,187
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stand up

212
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:27,958
for your
co-host of the evening,

213
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:29,397
Michael Gary Scott!

214
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:37,202
Please remain standing
for your other co-host
and new manager,

215
00:09:37,273 --> 00:09:42,302
Deangelo Jeremetrius Vickers!

216
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:51,151
DWIGHT: Is that part of the...

217
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,787
Deangelo. Hey.

218
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:01,461
Deangelo, what are you doing?
There's a live
audience out there.

219
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,898
Just go do it by yourself,
or get Ryan.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,162
No, Ryan would never do it.
It's too on the radar.

221
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:11,572
Look, look,
the boss hosts the Dundies.
It's sort of our perk.

222
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,371
This was not part of
the job description.

223
00:10:14,477 --> 00:10:15,536
Okay, listen to me.

224
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:17,740
You're not doing this for me,
you're not doing this for you.

225
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:19,248
You're not even
doing this for them.

226
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:21,307
What am I doing it for?

227
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,481
You're doing it for
all those kids out there

228
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,350
eating off
the Louie Volpe's kids menu

229
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:27,390
who are wondering,
"Does it get better?"

230
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:29,849
What I want you to do is,
I want you to say,

231
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:32,019
"It's show time."
And get out there.

232
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:35,387
I can't.
Say it.

233
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:36,964
Stop hitting me.

234
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,365
You can do it,
just say it.

235
00:10:39,168 --> 00:10:40,295
Hit me again.

236
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,097
Now hit me.

237
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:45,100
One, two, three...

238
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:46,198
It's show time!
It's show time!

239
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:48,370
All right, here we go.

240
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,541
Okay, okay,
sorry about the delay,
everybody,

241
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:58,918
but we were at
the DMV waiting in line.

242
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:03,886
Fall asleep right after sex.
Huh, guys?

243
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,093
Nope, go back to the script.

244
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:09,359
There are a lot
of great salesmen
in this office,

245
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:13,526
but one of our great salesmen
is also a great dad,

246
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:16,029
and a close
personal friend of mine.

247
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:19,234
Jim Halpert, Best Dad Dundie.

248
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,181
Wow, I do not
parent for the awards,

249
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,251
but I got to tell you,
it feels pretty good.

250
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:31,653
Cece, if you're
watching this at home,
it's way past your bedtime.

251
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:34,714
By the way,
how'd this get
televised? Thanks.

252
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:35,986
Well done.

253
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:37,322
I don't know,
maybe being a good dad

254
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,723
is just following
your own compass.

255
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,991
I don't know, I don't know.
Thank you.
Okay.

256
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,290
Didn't think to
mention me, huh?

257
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,358
Didn't I?

258
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:50,006
Which moves us to
Best Mom Dundie.

259
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:52,142
This person, well,
I guess we all sort of

260
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:54,267
consider a mom
around the office,

261
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:55,642
Meredith Palmer!

262
00:11:56,312 --> 00:11:57,712
Oh, my God!

263
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,248
WOMAN: Say what?

264
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:07,657
I'll tell you one thing,
I'm not going to be
a good mom tonight.

265
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:08,817
Whoo!

266
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:12,123
Excuse me, can I get a photo
of the best mom and
the best dad, please?

267
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:14,121
Step on up.

268
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:15,187
I've got to go do this.

269
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:16,254
Why?

270
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,202
Let's go, big smiles, folks.
There they are.

271
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:22,761
Year after year,
I catch a lot of flak
on this particular award

272
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,867
because year after year,
I present this award
to a guy instead of a girl.

273
00:12:26,943 --> 00:12:31,278
Hottest in the Office
goes to Danny Cordray!

274
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:33,915
Danny could not
be here tonight...

275
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:35,417
How do I feel
about not winning

276
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,019
Hottest in
the Office this year?

277
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:38,884
Um, I'm very relieved.

278
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:42,084
How do you judge
something like...
What is his criteria, even?

279
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,148
It's...

280
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:44,987
It's so subjective.

281
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:48,429
Stanley Hudson is a grump,
everybody knows that.

282
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:51,065
But did you know
that Stanley Hudson

283
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:54,627
is also the face of
a debilitating disease
known as diabetes?

284
00:12:56,606 --> 00:13:00,202
The Diabetes Award
goes to Stanley Hudson!

285
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:03,310
Come on up here,
you sick bastard.

286
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:09,484
I have diabetes, too.
You don't see me
making a big deal about it.

287
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,085
They say he's going to be
my right-hand man,

288
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:16,058
ad-lib masturbation joke. No.

289
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,687
I hate this.
I hate it so much.

290
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:23,461
Dwight Schrute,
please accept this Promising
Assistant Manager Dundie.

291
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:29,137
Thank you, thanks so much.
Um, I want to
dedicate this award

292
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:33,370
to something that, uh,
we take for granted
in our daily lives,

293
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:35,002
and that is
the humble trash can.

294
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:37,472
This is for you, trash can.

295
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:46,285
Who gave you those crayons?

296
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:48,153
I brought them from home.

297
00:13:48,324 --> 00:13:49,519
Do you have a red?

298
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:50,888
This is a cloth tablecloth.

299
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,394
You can't color on it.

300
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:54,357
Oh, really?

301
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:59,936
Did you know herpes affects
one out of every five
sexually active adults?

302
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:02,403
Pippi Longstocking,

303
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:06,239
Ronald McDonald's wife,
Ron Howard, Ron Weasley.

304
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,710
What do they all have
in common? Redheads.

305
00:14:09,345 --> 00:14:10,574
And, Erin Hannon,

306
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,545
come on up here to receive
your Cutest Redhead
in the Office award.

307
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,543
That is bull.

308
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,489
Thank you,
thank you,
thank you.

309
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:26,626
This is the first
award I've ever won
in my entire life.

310
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:31,725
People were right
about the Dundies,
they are magical.

311
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,567
But I don't feel it,

312
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:38,699
and I think that's because
I'm not with the right person.

313
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,370
Gabe...

314
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,200
GABE: What?

315
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:43,268
We should break up.

316
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,340
What?

317
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,174
I'm not attracted to you.

318
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:51,816
I just...
I cringe when you talk.

319
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,748
I have to be honest.

320
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:56,349
Right, Pam?

321
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:01,860
Thank you for hearing me.

322
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:06,068
Okay, well,
this is embarrassing.

323
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:09,230
Obviously
really angry at Erin.

324
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:12,537
Here comes that
quarter-life crisis
everyone's talking about.

325
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:16,778
All right, I'm gonna go.

326
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:20,916
Let's... There you go.

327
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:22,983
Damn, that was cold.

328
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:27,883
It is difficult to
recognize the person
who will be replacing you.

329
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:30,056
But he is a good guy,

330
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:34,496
so the Michael Scott Award
for Best Dundies Host

331
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:36,461
goes to Deangelo Vickers.

332
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:45,897
ALL: Speech, speech, speech...

333
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:46,965
Speech, speech, speech...

334
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:50,676
Hold on, hold on one second.

335
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,347
Crank it.

336
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:01,721
I want to...
I feel truly blessed
to be working with all of you.

337
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,659
You know,
before this all started,
funny story,

338
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:08,664
I was in the bathroom,
vomiting and vomiting
in that men's room.

339
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,461
Okay.
That's why it has
been shut down...

340
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:11,728
That's it.
for most of the evening.

341
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:13,793
This is important.
He's expressing himself.

342
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:15,064
Hosts don't get Dundies.
No.

343
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:17,197
This is truly special for me,

344
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:20,539
and, anyway,
it's so much lighter.

345
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,511
MICHAEL: Okay,
we're done. That's it.
What?

346
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:23,807
Michael, are we... What?

347
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,040
We're done, we're done.

348
00:16:27,249 --> 00:16:31,050
So, that is how it ends.
My last Dundies ever.

349
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:36,691
I was hoping it would be
more like Godfather III,

350
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,194
that wrapped up
the whole franchise

351
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:41,797
in an extremely
satisfying way,

352
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:45,091
but instead,
it is like Godfather I,

353
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:48,703
that was very confusing,

354
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,172
had maybe three big laughs.

355
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,235
Oh, well.

356
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,334
PAM: Hey, Michael?

357
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:58,346
We were thinking
maybe we could
keep this thing going.

358
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,377
What?

359
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:01,745
I know I'm the cause
of this royal screwup,

360
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:03,376
but I would like to
see the show go on.

361
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:05,421
No, don't. You're
being too hard on yourself.

362
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:07,546
We had a very
truncated rehearsal time.

363
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,489
Let's grab some
ice cream, go back

364
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:11,356
to the office,
and finish what we started.

365
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:14,054
So what you're saying is,
you kind of liked it?

366
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,655
"I've fallen,
and I can't get up."

367
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:18,496
That Phyllis bit.
That was pretty good, right?

368
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,559
I don't know that
we need to dissect it all
right now, but it...

369
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:21,797
That got a big laugh.
It did.

370
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:23,396
That actually got a big laugh.
Pretty huge laugh.

371
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:25,134
You were laughing, right?
I was.

372
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:27,742
Oh, you know what?
I have to go to the bathroom.

373
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,869
Don't worry,
we're really close.

374
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:30,879
Really, you know, I can just
run over to
the gas station there.

375
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:32,141
We should just
wait here and not get

376
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:33,510
good seats in
the conference room?

377
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,346
That's true, we
wouldn't get seats together.

378
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:37,779
Okay, yeah, I'll hold it.
I'm fine.

379
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:41,585
You know,
despite a couple of hiccups,
I thought that went very well.

380
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:44,559
I thought it was
the worst Dundies
I've ever been to.

381
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:48,164
Man! Maybe you should have won
the Kind of a Bitch Award.

382
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:53,292
Gladly. I'd accept that award,
because a bitch
is a female dog.

383
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,529
What? What are
you doing?
Aah!

384
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:57,629
What...
Ooh!

385
00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:01,142
Please don't stop
so suddenly. Seatbelt's
pressing on my bladder.

386
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,573
Why are you even
wearing a seatbelt?

387
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:03,977
You're sitting in
the backseat, baby.

388
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:05,105
What is your problem?

389
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:07,514
I just don't see the point
of the Dundies, okay?

390
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,280
The jokes are terrible,
the venue was bad,
the fashion was boring.

391
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:14,619
Okay, that is unfair.
The clothing was
safe but tasteful.

392
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,850
And next time,
why don't you pick a co-host

393
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:19,052
that doesn't have
microphone-a-phobia?

394
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:20,960
Look, whatever
you're going to do,

395
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:22,929
how long is it
going to take, ballpark?

396
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,467
Because I just...
I've got to make
a decision here.

397
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:31,770
He is in
an all-out sprint.

398
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,537
better than before.

399
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:36,339
Please, excuse me.

400
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:38,778
Here... Okay.

401
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:40,840
By his own admission,
this person

402
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,975
actually tried
marijuana in college,

403
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:47,417
so the Doobie Doobie Pothead
Stoner of the Year Award

404
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,050
goes to Andy Bernard!

405
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,153
Yes.

406
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:53,418
Ohhh!

407
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:55,588
There's a lot of
people I'd like to thank,

408
00:18:55,664 --> 00:18:58,133
but I think we
all actually want
to thank you, Michael.

409
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:00,269
Oh! Thank you.

410
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:03,932
I mean, we actually really
all want to thank
you for everything.

411
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:10,008
Oh, my God.
Something's happening.

412
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:16,643
9,986,000 minutes

413
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,685
We actually sat
down and did the math

414
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:25,925
9,986,000 minutes

415
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:30,426
That's how many minutes
that you've worked here

416
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,890
In costumes

417
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,957
And impressions

418
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:34,531
In meetings

419
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,899
In cups of coffee

420
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:37,162
For birthdays

421
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,330
More meetings and...

422
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:40,569
E-mail forwards
you made us read

423
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,209
9,986,000 minutes

424
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:49,708
That's like watching
Die Hard 80,000 times

425
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:52,083
You hit me with your car

426
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:54,452
You helped me get off drugs

427
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:56,885
I watch you when you sleep

428
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,894
I forgive you for kissing me

429
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:02,257
Remember to call

430
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:04,333
You've got to remember to call

431
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
Remember to call

432
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:09,468
Love is a gift from up above

433
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:11,268
Remember to call

434
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,139
Text or call or e-mail or call

435
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:20,875
Measure,
measure your life in love

436
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,718
Remember to call

437
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:27,255
Yeah, yeah, yeah

438
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:29,315
Remember to call

439
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:32,555
Yeah, yeah, you've
got to remember to call

440
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,792
Remember to call

441
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,327
Yeah, okay.

442
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:46,669
Well, this is going to
hurt like a mother.

443
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:50,307
Every day,
millions of Americans

444
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:52,176
suffer from
extreme repulsiveness.

445
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:55,810
Someone in our midst
is bringing that
problem to light.

446
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:58,047
Toby Flenderson,
please come up here

447
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,248
and accept
the Extreme
Repulsiveness Award.

448
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:01,346
Oh, that's so mean.

449
00:21:01,423 --> 00:21:02,413
No, it's fine.

450
00:21:02,691 --> 00:21:03,784
It's his last Dundies.

451
00:21:03,926 --> 00:21:05,053
You got to play along, man.

452
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:07,358
Come on, Toby.

453
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:08,658
Here he comes!

454
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:11,664
All right, you deserved it.

455
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:15,262
I really disagree with this.
I think it's kind of hateful.

456
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:16,928
Although,
I am a little happy right now

457
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:19,305
to have
a platform to talk about
the outcome of a case

458
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,776
that I was
recently a juror on,
the Scranton Strangler.

459
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:25,608
A man's being put to death,
I was part of the verdict,

460
00:21:25,681 --> 00:21:27,775
and I'm not so sure
he's guilty anymore.
