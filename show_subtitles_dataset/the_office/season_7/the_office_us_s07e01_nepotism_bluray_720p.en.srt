1
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:41,445
You're falling behind.

2
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:49,153
Wuphf. Com.

3
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:51,197
Ryan, we're doing a dance...
This is how you
build a business.

4
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:52,254
KELLY: We're doing a dance.

5
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:53,890
RYAN: This is how you
make it in this country.

6
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,555
Find out...
You got Creed.

7
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:18,648
You jump in front of them.

8
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,250
You make it so hard
to love you sometimes.

9
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:22,590
Still behind.

10
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:23,687
I'll take these.

11
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:26,130
I said I didn't want
to be on the Internet!

12
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,757
Go, go, go, go!

13
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:43,076
ALL: Streamers!

14
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:50,912
Dwight!

15
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:52,288
Dwight, you got
to be kidding me!

16
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,849
Are you crazy?

17
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:16,979
Toby, how did we do?

18
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,018
TOBY: Well, that was better.

19
00:02:19,086 --> 00:02:21,611
We did it! Yes!

20
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:04,759
MICHAEL: I suppose summer
had to end sometime.

21
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:08,267
It's sad, though,
because I had
a great summer.

22
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:11,099
I got West Nile virus.
Lost a ton of weight.

23
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,139
Then I went back
to the lake.

24
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:16,642
I stepped on
a piece of glass
in the parking lot,

25
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,802
which hurt.

26
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,813
That got infected,
even though I peed on it.

27
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:23,472
Saw Inception.

28
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:27,145
Or at least
I dreamt I did.

29
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,620
Broccoli Rob,
obviously, will be there.

30
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:31,680
Yes, of course.

31
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:34,022
And J.C.
We call him Blorville,

32
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:36,562
because he looks
like a black
Orville Redenbacher.

33
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,689
Who's the guy who
invented the peanut?

34
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:39,925
Hey, guys.
Hey!

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,558
Hi. Hi.

36
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:42,659
Sorry, didn't mean
to interrupt.

37
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:43,725
Not at all.

38
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:46,598
I'm gonna head
back to Siberia there.

39
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,605
I started dating
Erin this summer.

40
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,979
It has been,
in a word, exquisite.

41
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,018
Gabe is awesome.

42
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:04,615
He has accomplished
so much career-wise
and height-wise.

43
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,090
Thank God he's my boss

44
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,956
because I would
not have said yes

45
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,996
to a first date if
I didn't have to.

46
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,827
But, it's been great.

47
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:16,130
Am I angry that Gabe
stole my girlfriend
over the summer?

48
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:17,568
No.

49
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:20,731
I've been through
anger management, okay?

50
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,766
So right now I am
sitting on a nice beach
at Cape Cod,

51
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:27,177
gazing out across
the whitecaps.

52
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:31,679
Oh, look,
it's a humpback whale.

53
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:33,117
How pretty.

54
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,048
He's eating Gabe.

55
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:42,419
Hey.

56
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:44,388
What are you doing?

57
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:46,591
From now on,
if you're hot,
sit on an ice pack.

58
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,099
Well, what if
you're cold?

59
00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:51,462
Like you'd
ever be cold, Kevin.

60
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:53,335
Stop asking me
hypothetical questions.

61
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:54,669
I'm too busy.

62
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:55,901
Hey, Dwight,
I don't know
if you heard,

63
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:58,001
but we're supposed
to be drinking out
of weird backpacks

64
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:00,342
instead of cups,
like regular people.
Oh, you did hear.

65
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,742
Jim, you have one job to do
and you do it forgettably.

66
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:06,547
Those of us who are busy
require hands-free hydration.

67
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,350
Dwight Schrute,
star salesman,
beet farmer.

68
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:12,688
Bed and breakfast proprietor.
Aspiring freelance bodyguard.

69
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,489
Add to that list,
owner of this building.

70
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:19,065
Then burn the list.

71
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:24,837
This summer I did
the Minority Executive
Training program at Yale.

72
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,338
You guys, I'm, like,
really smart now.

73
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:28,203
You don't even know.
You could ask me,

74
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,209
"Kelly, what's the
biggest company
in the world?"

75
00:05:30,277 --> 00:05:32,302
And I'd be, like,
"Blah, blah, blah,

76
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,937
"blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah,"

77
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:36,448
giving you the exact
right answer.

78
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:38,013
Coffee monkey's arrived.

79
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:40,611
I thought the coffee
was supposed to be
here at 9:00.

80
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,815
Here you go, Big O.

81
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,186
Tiny.

82
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,286
Darryl Hanah.

83
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:53,488
This says "decaf."
You got me decaf?

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,403
Ooh, yeah.
Must have been some
sort of mix-up there.

85
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,439
You cool to just drink it,
or should I drive
all the way back?

86
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:11,574
Well, summer,
I blew out my knee
playing softball.

87
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:14,142
Ended up watching
CNN most of the time.

88
00:06:14,221 --> 00:06:16,189
I don't know
how we're gonna get
out of Afghanistan.

89
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:18,281
I hate the new assistant.

90
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:20,849
He's only been
here for a week
and I hate him.

91
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,919
The new guy sucks.
Calls me "The Nard man."

92
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:27,091
I'm the "Nard dog," okay?
Nard man is my father.

93
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,461
My name is Luke Cooper.

94
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,401
I love cinema.

95
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:34,872
My favorite
movies are Citizen Kane
and The Boondock Saints.

96
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:39,002
That kid is the worst.
Needs to be fired, Michael.

97
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,809
He's not the worst. Okay?
He's not the worst.

98
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:42,906
You know who's
the worst?

99
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,209
That intern we had
a few years ago.
That guy.

100
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:46,843
Remember?

101
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,649
That face,
how ugly he was?

102
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,282
He was the worst.
Good worker, though.

103
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:52,347
Mmm!

104
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:54,516
It's not cappuccino.

105
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:55,583
He messed yours up, too.

106
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,856
He's got to go, Mike.

107
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,454
It's just coffee, guys.

108
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:00,557
But, yeah,
I'll look into it, okay?

109
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:05,098
Wow, that's a lot of keys.

110
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,668
The bigger the key chain,
the more powerful the man.

111
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:09,675
That's right.
The janitor said that.

112
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:11,005
By the way,
the raccoons are back.

113
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,066
Where?

114
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,312
I think they run
through these panels
and then down under the map.

115
00:07:15,382 --> 00:07:17,509
I wouldn't know for
sure 'cause I don't
have a trained ear.

116
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:18,676
That's why I have
to use one of these.

117
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,083
Give me that.
Yep.

118
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,986
Wait. And this.

119
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:26,292
Yes.
Go get 'em.

120
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,050
What happened to
me this summer?

121
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:29,186
Dwight bought
the building,

122
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:33,221
so, actually, this has
been the busiest
summer of my life.

123
00:07:46,546 --> 00:07:49,014
Hey, what's so
funny over here?

124
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,076
Ha! Very nice.
Give me my keys.

125
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,487
Ha! Ha!

126
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,994
Not funny, Jim!

127
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:06,723
Sorry.

128
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,824
Oh, no.
Don't worry about it.

129
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,836
I was just gonna
put a couple keys on
every day until Christmas.

130
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,895
Then his pants
would have fallen down,

131
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:14,065
which was a little
gift to me, but...

132
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:15,569
It was really funny.

133
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:16,799
Well, it would
have been.

134
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,576
So unprofessional,
Mrs. Halpert.

135
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:23,447
I love you.

136
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:26,515
Thanks.

137
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:27,610
Luke.

138
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:29,447
Luke!

139
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,414
What's up, Venus?

140
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,592
Did you send those
samples to Justin
at Lehigh Motors yesterday?

141
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:35,992
Because he didn't get them.

142
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:39,395
Uh, if you
asked me to do it,
I'm sure I did it.

143
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,361
Yeah, strawberries
are ripe.

144
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:43,527
MEREDITH: Hey.

145
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:46,197
Turn off the Chumbawamba
and scram, twerp.

146
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:48,035
All right.
You don't have to yell.

147
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:49,473
Okay, rude.

148
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,802
Luke,

149
00:08:52,278 --> 00:08:54,906
I want you to go to
the supermarket for me.

150
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:56,239
What for?

151
00:08:56,316 --> 00:08:58,216
To get some ice cream
for everybody.

152
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:01,185
It's national
ice cream afternoon.

153
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,154
Great.

154
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:05,748
And another thing
I did this summer,

155
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,721
I hired my nephew.

156
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:13,862
Having Luke here
is a pretty big
deal for me.

157
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,901
Because his mother,

158
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,961
who also happens
to be my half sister,

159
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,702
kind of cut me off from
that side of the family
15 years ago...

160
00:09:22,776 --> 00:09:24,801
Fourteen.

161
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:29,042
The last time I saw Luke
was the opening day
of Ace Ventura II,

162
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:30,309
and that was '95.

163
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:33,079
So, yes,
15 years on the dot.

164
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,590
Anyway, I lost
him in a forest.

165
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,721
"Don't bother Luke."

166
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,894
Why is there a circle
with a line through it?

167
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,357
That means don't.

168
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,830
Haven't you seen
Ghost Busters, Pam?

169
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,727
Yeah,
but it's like you're saying
we should bother Luke.

170
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:50,731
No, it...

171
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:54,803
Yes, okay. Right.
All right, yep. My bad.

172
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:56,273
I got it.

173
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:58,539
Here we go.

174
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,971
Don't don't bother Luke.
Got it.

175
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:05,713
Come on. Okay.

176
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:12,388
That's as clear
as I can make it.

177
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,459
Hey, why can't
we bother Luke?
He deserves it.

178
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,119
Because I don't
want it getting
back to Sabre

179
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:17,356
that we're yelling
at assistants.

180
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,897
I think it would
reflect poorly on us.

181
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,796
Who's gonna tell
on us? Gabe?

182
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:23,667
That'd be hilarious.

183
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:26,797
"Jo, they're creating
a hostile work environment.
Stop them."

184
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:27,897
Nope, it won't be Gabe.

185
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:29,874
But, actually, there is
somebody in the office

186
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:31,342
who is very,
very close to Luke.

187
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:32,734
How close?

188
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,074
Well, Dwight,
he wiped his butt.

189
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:35,307
Is that close
enough for you?

190
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,307
Yes. Of course.

191
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:41,217
Guys, I think Michael
and Luke are related.

192
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:42,413
No.

193
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:44,081
No, Toby. He's not.

194
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,115
Yes, he is.
He's my nephew.

195
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,125
What?
What?

196
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:50,691
Luke is my nephew.

197
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:51,856
OSCAR: Michael,
that's nepotism.

198
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:54,057
Luke is getting
special treatment
because he's your nephew.

199
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:57,160
Yes, exactly.
That is a very nice way
of putting it, Oscar.

200
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,071
Mixing family and business
is a beautiful thing.

201
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,903
What's wrong with
a level playing field?

202
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:05,638
Do you think
they should have
had open auditions

203
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:06,906
for the band Hanson?

204
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:09,738
What if no one
named Hanson showed up?

205
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,215
That wouldn't
even make sense.

206
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:15,778
Or what if they just
hired the littlest kid
and a 50- year-old guy

207
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,084
who was a murderer?

208
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:20,283
Really safe.

209
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:22,823
Oh, man, so many
points being made.

210
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,821
CREED: I couldn't care
less about nepotism.

211
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:27,257
But I'm loving the debate.

212
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,494
Great minds battling it out.

213
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,503
And I've got
a front row seat.

214
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:34,865
God, when he needed
help on earth,
who did he hire?

215
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,272
Jesus Christ, his son.

216
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,636
That's a really
tight argument.

217
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,836
MICHAEL: Thank you.
Yeah.

218
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:41,540
But you're
comparing you and Luke
to God and Jesus.

219
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:42,706
No. No.

220
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,512
I'm just saying,
why does God get to do
something that I don't?

221
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,182
This is hypothetical.

222
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:49,221
We're talking about Luke,
who happens to be terrible.

223
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:52,087
Well, then, why aren't
you bugging me to fire
everybody who's bad?

224
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:54,922
You just want me
to fire Luke.
That's reverse nepotism.

225
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:58,128
He should not be
punished because
he is related to me

226
00:11:58,198 --> 00:11:59,597
and bad at what he does!

227
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,791
I would just like
to say something
off of what Darryl said

228
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,267
about the level
playing field.

229
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:05,668
That is actually
a zoning issue.

230
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:10,541
So, thank you.

231
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,638
If there's nothing
wrong with this, Michael,

232
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,010
why have you been
keeping it a secret?

233
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:19,484
Because I wanted you
to come to me and say,
"Wow, he is so great."

234
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,952
And I was gonna say,
"Well, it's in the genes."

235
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,455
And I was actually
gonna be wearing jeans.

236
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:25,616
And I'd point
to them, right?

237
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:26,920
No. 'Cause you ruined it.

238
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,453
So, thank you very much.

239
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,997
Here he comes.
Guys, look.

240
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:35,831
I don't want you to
treat him like anyone
else in the office.

241
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,097
I just want you
to treat him
like my nephew.

242
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,832
Hey, there he is.
ERIN: Hey!

243
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,373
There he is!
Ice cream afternoon!

244
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:44,742
Wait.

245
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:48,144
Soy ice cream?
Did you get
real ice cream?

246
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:49,476
Or enough
for everyone?

247
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,511
No, man.
There was no list.

248
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:53,779
But I got bagel chips.

249
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:56,117
Oh, my favorite part of
an ice cream party.
The bagel chips.

250
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,647
Clutch cream run, bro.

251
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,421
Get whatever you want.
On me.

252
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:07,095
You really think you
can make it up to me
with food?

253
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,895
I don't know.
That usually works.

254
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:11,994
I feel horrible for
blowing Jim's prank.

255
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,835
I don't know
if you can tell,
but he's mildly upset.

256
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:16,341
And Dwight hasn't
been messed with
in a while,

257
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:18,673
so he's become a monster.

258
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:20,235
I need to
make this right.

259
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:31,386
I came down here to
feed the feral cats
like I usually do,

260
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,925
and I found something
unsavory in the back
of your nephew's car.

261
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:37,326
Okay, you know what?
Just... Just back off.
Back off!

262
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:40,230
Well, take a look.
It's all the packages
he was supposed to overnight.

263
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,791
He never bothered
to send them.

264
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:45,963
All right,
those might be his.

265
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,370
He might own
an eBay Store.

266
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,533
Yep. That's exactly
what my first thought was.

267
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,008
And then I remembered
having a conversation
with him

268
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:52,942
where he was like,
"I don't own an eBay Store."
So...

269
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,071
Okay, okay.
You know what?
This is disgusting.

270
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:56,581
This is like
a witch hunt.

271
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,514
This is like
The Blair Witch
Hunt Project.

272
00:13:58,584 --> 00:14:00,313
I'm sure those are
the expense reports

273
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:01,978
that corporate was
waiting for yesterday.

274
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,250
They are not.
Let's just make this
kid open his damn car.

275
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,315
Oh, my gosh, those are
the pants you wanted
to return to Talbots.

276
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:08,656
I'm reconsidering
sending them back
anyway.

277
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:10,991
You get that kid
to open this car,

278
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,462
or I'm gonna
do it myself

279
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,830
by calling AAA.

280
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,334
Wait a minute.
I'm in.

281
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,365
Don't... All right.

282
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:20,235
Well, okay.

283
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,240
You've just
committed a felony.

284
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,434
Yep, here they are.

285
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:26,772
Yep, I just lost a client
'cause I swore I sent
these samples on time.

286
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:27,972
This kid's costing
us sales, Michael.

287
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,948
I'm sorry,
do you want to try
them on again to see...

288
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:34,986
No, I know they fit.
It's not about the fit.

289
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:39,791
Why is this my problem,
Michael?

290
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,349
Because Gabe tattled.

291
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:44,089
I was perfectly happy
to just hide it from you.

292
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,858
GABE: Those overnight
packages needed
to go out,

293
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,866
and Michael refuses
to hold the guilty
party accountable.

294
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,466
Lower yourself, Gabe.

295
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:52,060
I don't wanna be
having a conversation
with your crotch.

296
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:57,107
Okay, now educate me
why you won't fire the boy.

297
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:58,737
You don't have
all the facts.

298
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:00,811
Which are?
I love him.

299
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,912
Oh, God.
How far has it gone?

300
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,687
No. No. He's my nephew.

301
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:11,617
Well, I got a nephew, too,
but he don't work for me.

302
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:14,285
You know why?
'Cause he's a screw-up.

303
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,828
He can swim in my pool,
but he can't come in my house.

304
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:20,831
Well, this office is my pool
and my house is my house,

305
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,063
and I just want
my nephew to work
in my pool.

306
00:15:24,137 --> 00:15:27,197
If you keep him, Michael,
I'm gonna hold you
accountable for him.

307
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,533
You're on the hook for
this kid. You got that?
Mmm-hmm.

308
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:31,436
Cover his ass
like tighty-whiteys.

309
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:34,639
I will cover his ass
like moss on
a Mississippi tree stump.

310
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:36,943
Was how I put it
not clear enough?

311
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,041
I mean, you had
to go and make up
your own saying?

312
00:15:39,152 --> 00:15:40,141
Okay.

313
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,277
Deal with it, boys.

314
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:48,591
Luke and I have been
working side by side
as master and commander.

315
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,458
Me as master,
he as commander.

316
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,395
Occasionally,
he'll need a little push.

317
00:15:52,465 --> 00:15:56,959
And I will do that,
and he'll slow down,
and then I'll push him again.

318
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,004
That's the thing with kids.
You have to keep pushing.

319
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:01,438
You have to push them
until they push you back,

320
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:02,701
and then you
push some more.

321
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:06,711
It's all about give
and take, but mostly it's
about pushing each other.

322
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:09,406
Oh, yeah.

323
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:10,881
This will be easy.

324
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,282
So just, like, rearrange
the buttons and stuff.

325
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:16,387
Yeah, yeah.
Like when he presses
"door close," the doors open.

326
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,048
Or he presses "lobby,"
it goes to third floor.

327
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,421
Stuff like that.
Can you do that?

328
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:22,517
Yeah. Let me
take a look at
the circus board.

329
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:26,022
Dwight is about
to get so Pammed.

330
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,859
Hey, did you
SMSItext message me?

331
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:31,369
Yeah, I wanted to
show you something
in the lobby. Come on.

332
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:41,037
Okay, that's weird.
I was just hitting
"door close." What?

333
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:42,838
There we go.
Well...

334
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:43,904
Good.

335
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,314
Is this elevator
going up?
Hmm?

336
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:48,676
Hey, the elevator
is disobeying us!

337
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,519
Okay. Okay.
We are stuck.
We are stuck.

338
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,352
Hank! Hank!
Can you hear us?

339
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,057
Oh, my God. Okay.
Emergency protocol.

340
00:16:59,132 --> 00:17:01,259
Okay, just...
Just... Just calm down.

341
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:04,235
Pam, try and pry open
those front doors,
immediately.

342
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,965
I don't...
Use your talons!
Pry 'em open!

343
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,973
Okay, Dwight...
Oh, my God!

344
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,133
Well, don't look, freak!

345
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,972
Dwight, what are you doing?
Well...

346
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:14,011
We've only been in here
for, like, two seconds.

347
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,980
I got 56 ounces of
fluid in my bladder!

348
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:18,039
And we have
to establish
a pee corner.

349
00:17:18,117 --> 00:17:20,278
You've got to
be kidding me.

350
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,451
Luke is going to
use his laser pointer
to point to account setup.

351
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:27,891
You click on that first,
then a whole new...
Not... No, no, no.

352
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,587
Luke, come on. Come on.

353
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,527
Not on Oscar's head.

354
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,588
All right.
Luke, come on.

355
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,788
Stop it.

356
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,027
What? I'm stopping it.
That's what you said.

357
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:38,428
Give me the pointer.

358
00:17:38,504 --> 00:17:39,630
So you just
want me to move it.

359
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:40,797
You're being
totally unclear here.

360
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:42,864
I'm just gonna go
ahead and move it.
No, just power it down.

361
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,308
No, no, no, no, no.
Not on Angela's boob.
Come on. Come on.

362
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:46,604
Luke, seriously.

363
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,874
All right, fine, fine.
I'll just go.
Okay.

364
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,781
I'm gone.
All right. Okay.

365
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:52,909
Good job.

366
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:54,347
Okay, email accounts.

367
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,149
So, we're starting
with account setup.

368
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,656
Oh, my God,
is it in my eyeball?
Yes.

369
00:17:58,724 --> 00:17:59,816
I think he's
burning my eye.

370
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,187
ANGELA: Michael,
do something.

371
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,921
Sack up, man.
KELLY: You have
to stop this.

372
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:04,087
Luke, can I have that?
No.

373
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:07,291
Okay, I am going to
count down from five.

374
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:08,424
Five.
Five.

375
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:09,490
Four.
Four.

376
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:11,036
I'm not kidding.

377
00:18:11,137 --> 00:18:12,195
Three.
Three.

378
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,329
Two.
Two.

379
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:14,964
One. Give... Okay.

380
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,838
All right, give it up.
No!

381
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:20,401
You are going
to learn to be more
professional, Luke!

382
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:21,502
LUKE: What the...

383
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:24,175
That's what you're
going to do, Luke!

384
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,478
What the hell was that?

385
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:27,348
I had to do that.

386
00:18:29,188 --> 00:18:30,485
this!

387
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:32,620
Screw it!
All right.
Are we good?

388
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,152
You're okay.

389
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,561
He's okay.

390
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:45,526
There are many different
schools of thought
on capital punishment.

391
00:18:45,605 --> 00:18:47,368
That was awesome.

392
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,671
Texas justice.

393
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,573
Yeah, your nephew
is so lame.

394
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:54,670
He's been trashing us
relentlessly on Twitter.

395
00:18:54,747 --> 00:18:57,181
Yeah, it's funny
stuff, but mean.

396
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,241
You follow him
on Twitter?

397
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:02,048
Everywhere I look,
it's Betty White this
and Betty White that.

398
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,988
Finally,
a kid who's not talking
about Betty White.

399
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:06,456
Of course I follow him.

400
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,024
Michael, you just
physically assaulted
an employee.

401
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:11,358
Can we talk in private?

402
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:15,190
Yes, of course.
What is this
in reference to?

403
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,463
Pam?

404
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:20,800
PAM: Oh, hey, Jim.

405
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:24,570
Some prankster
switched the elevator
buttons on Dwight.

406
00:19:24,644 --> 00:19:25,668
I did not do this.

407
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:26,734
I know.

408
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:33,816
Yeah, and it was going
really great at first.
I got video.

409
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:36,212
This is impressive.

410
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:38,088
Well, you know,
they don't call me

411
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:39,681
"The Bart Simpson of
Scranton" for nothing.

412
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:42,458
Do they call you that?
They do call me that.

413
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,194
Come on, give me your hand.
I'll help you down.

414
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,591
Nope. Scared of
getting cut in half.

415
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,724
Also, there's
pee on the floor.

416
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,091
Oh.

417
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:51,864
Of course there is.
Hey, Chinese tonight?

418
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,636
Yeah.
All right.

419
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,703
How you doing?
Pretty good.

420
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,470
You must be
almost out of water.

421
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:02,310
Stop drinking
the water! Stop!

422
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:08,743
ANDY: No, no, no, no.
It's the other hand,
right hand.

423
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:09,810
Right hand?
Yeah.

424
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,584
MICHAEL: Would have
been nice to work
with my family.

425
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:15,457
It would have been nice
if Luke had been
able to stay here.

426
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:16,790
But he couldn't.

427
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:19,160
These things
seldom work out.

428
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,699
I don't know how
Ringling Brothers do it.

429
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:24,565
Night after night,
town after town,
all across America.

430
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,763
You would think
they'd be sick of
each other by now,

431
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:29,865
but, clearly,
they make it work.

432
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,239
And my hat's off to them.

433
00:20:34,347 --> 00:20:35,405
Hey! Whoa!

434
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:36,812
You...
Hey.

435
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,543
Dwight.
Dwight...

436
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:41,111
Stop!

437
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:44,821
Legal says the best
way to protect us
from a lawsuit

438
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,256
is to call this
a stress induced
outburst.

439
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:48,682
Mmm-hmm.

440
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:51,661
You will have to
undergo six sessions
of counseling.

441
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,658
That's it? Really?

442
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,095
That's nothing.
All right.

443
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:59,069
That's highway
robbery. Good.

444
00:20:59,138 --> 00:21:00,799
Well, that's the spirit.
I can do that.

445
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:02,670
And you will do your
counseling right here

446
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:05,142
because our HR staff
are all certified
counselors.

447
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:07,839
Okay. Wait, what?

448
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,916
Yeah, I'm really looking
forward to working
with you, Michael.

449
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:14,910
Is there another option?

450
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,514
The alternative
is termination.

451
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,958
Michael?
