1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,662
Andy?

2
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:10,263
Attend the tale
Of Sweeney Todd

3
00:00:11,575 --> 00:00:14,510
His skin was pale
And his eye was odd

4
00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:15,602
Yes.

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,271
He shaved the faces
Of gentlemen

6
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:19,611
Who never thereafter
Were heard of again

7
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:22,516
He trod a path
That few have trod

8
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:24,850
Did Sweeney Todd

9
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:28,119
The demon barber
Of Fleet Street

10
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:30,920
Did you write this?
No.

11
00:00:30,994 --> 00:00:32,222
Who did?
Stephen Sondheim.

12
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:33,456
Who is he?

13
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:37,296
Swing your
Razor wide, Sweeney

14
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:41,064
Hold it to the skies

15
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:47,304
Freely flows the blood
Of those who moralize

16
00:00:47,377 --> 00:00:49,242
What the hell is happening?

17
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:50,610
We are the cast
of Sweeney Todd:

18
00:00:50,681 --> 00:00:51,943
The Demon Barber
of Fleet Street.

19
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:53,209
We open in
a couple of weeks

20
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:54,841
at the Loose Screw
Playhouse, here in Scranton.

21
00:00:54,918 --> 00:00:59,480
And today, just doing
a wee bit
of viral marketing, gov'nor!

22
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:01,581
ALL:
Attend the tale
Of Sweeney Todd

23
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:05,452
He served a dark
and a vengeful God

24
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,463
He served a dark
and a vengeful God

25
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,258
What happens then
Well, that's the play

26
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:13,098
And he wouldn't
Want us to give it away

27
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,472
Not Sweeney Todd

28
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,675
The demon barber of Fleet

29
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:22,204
Street

30
00:01:23,046 --> 00:01:24,775
Wow!

31
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:31,049
Oh, that was amazing!
That was awesome!

32
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:33,851
I auditioned for this!
When did the cast list go up?

33
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:35,917
Like a month ago.

34
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:37,585
Really? They didn't call me!

35
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:41,322
Who am I playing?

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,626
Andy?

37
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:24,704
Two comps for milady
and her Gabe.
It's closing night.

38
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,174
Tomorrow we have to
give the theater over

39
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,709
to the Scranton's
Miss Fitness Pageant.

40
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:31,441
I am so excited,
but I just need one.
Gabe can't come. Sorry.

41
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,312
What?
Yeah.

42
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:35,817
That's awful.
Everyone's
gonna miss that guy.

43
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,650
Gabe is not coming,
which is huge,

44
00:02:38,722 --> 00:02:40,986
because my plan
is to make Erin

45
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,854
fall back in love
with me tonight.

46
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:47,022
Women cannot resist
a man singing show tunes.

47
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:49,866
It's so powerful,
even a lot of men

48
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,367
can't resist a man
singing show tunes.

49
00:02:52,436 --> 00:02:54,165
Oh, who else is going?
Everyone.

50
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,398
Gabe seemed to
think no one was going.

51
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:58,903
What kind of terrible
rumormonger is Gabe?

52
00:02:58,976 --> 00:03:01,444
He is woefully
ill informed, all right?

53
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,671
Excuse me.

54
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:07,306
Everybody, you're all coming
to my show tonight, right?

55
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:08,373
Andy, what time's it start?

56
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:09,441
8:00 p.m. Sharp.

57
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,986
How long is it?
Hour and 45...

58
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:12,180
No, I can't make it.

59
00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:15,857
They say that no one
can take your pride,

60
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:19,555
but the people who
cast Andy's play,
they took mine.

61
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:21,858
Jim, Pam, you guys
are in, right?

62
00:03:21,932 --> 00:03:25,834
Oh, we wanted to, but our
sitter just fell through.
I'm really sorry.

63
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:27,827
Dwight?
No, thank you.

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,005
Last time I went
to the theater,

65
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,906
a man dressed as
a cat sat on my lap.

66
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:39,412
It would mean so much
to me if you came to
my show tonight.

67
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:41,815
I can't, Andy.
It's too hard.

68
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:43,147
That's...

69
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:47,146
I put everything I
had into that audition.
Do you understand that?

70
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:48,350
If it makes you
feel any better,

71
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:51,917
no one who auditioned
for the part of Sweeney Todd
got that part.

72
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:53,087
They had to bring
in a ringer.

73
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:57,491
This guy's, like, world class.
You should not feel bad.

74
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:01,629
I'm asking you,
thespian to thespian,

75
00:04:01,705 --> 00:04:05,471
will you please
be the bigger man
and come to my show?

76
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:08,477
I wish I could,
Andy, but I can't.

77
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:11,036
I have plans that night.

78
00:04:11,114 --> 00:04:14,572
I'm going to see
a friend in a play
called Sweeney Todd.

79
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:19,378
You're that friend.
I'm going to see your play.

80
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:22,919
Nice!

81
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:24,927
And scene.

82
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:28,028
Listen, I would like
you to take me to
Andy's play tonight.

83
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,227
Please, waste of time.

84
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,461
You know what?
Let's just knock
this out right now.

85
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,662
Disrobe.

86
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:38,140
Angela?
Don't like her anymore.
Not attracted to her anymore.

87
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,109
Just contractually obligated
to make a baby with her.

88
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,378
Give me the punch card.
No.

89
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:44,607
If you want to
punch the punch card,

90
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,773
you have to take
me to the show.

91
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:47,780
That is not in the contract.

92
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:50,183
Well, there's a lot of
gray area in that clause.

93
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:51,652
Do you want to re-mediate?

94
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:54,953
All right, fine!
I'll go to your little show.

95
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,083
But I'm not wearing a cape.

96
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,148
Thank you.

97
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:59,627
Dwight and I have
a contractual agreement

98
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:02,529
to procreate five times,
plain and simple.

99
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:06,626
And should he
develop feelings for me?

100
00:05:06,703 --> 00:05:09,900
Well, that would be
permissible under
item 7C, clause 2,

101
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:13,340
so I would not object.

102
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,503
Hey. How are those salads?

103
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:16,603
It's my own fault...

104
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,309
My parents used
to scramble to
find babysitters

105
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,318
so they could take
my little brother
to do stuff.

106
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:23,546
I understand how
hard it can be.

107
00:05:24,421 --> 00:05:26,252
I just... Tonight,
I mean, if you could...

108
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:27,483
We'll keep looking.

109
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:28,683
Yes!
Really?

110
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,421
I mean, who knows?
Maybe I have a niece
my family never told me about.

111
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,122
Oh, my gosh,
that would be amazing.

112
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:34,561
Yeah.
For a lot of reasons.

113
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,429
Yeah, I know. Niece!

114
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:40,328
Oh! Hey, guys.

115
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:42,065
You brought
balloons to a play?

116
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,539
I did, because I am
being the bigger man,

117
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:46,235
and balloons are
bigger than flowers.

118
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:47,298
It's nice, like Up.

119
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:48,366
Yes.

120
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:51,345
Excuse me.
Are you the guy
that did an entire

121
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:53,781
Law & Order episode
for his audition?

122
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:57,311
Nope.

123
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:00,490
Guys?
ALL: Hey!

124
00:06:00,557 --> 00:06:01,819
Andy!
Hey!

125
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:04,122
You all made it.
Thank you so much.

126
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:05,661
You should
actually thank Erin.

127
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,253
She's the one who
agreed to babysit.

128
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:10,193
She's babysitting?

129
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:14,761
I really wanted to see
Andy's play, because
he's so, so talented,

130
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:17,602
but I've been trying
to get in the babysitting
game forever.

131
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:21,132
The 13- year-olds
in this town have
a complete monopoly.

132
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,736
It's almost like
a babysitters' club.

133
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:25,281
I understand.

134
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,716
This is, like, a huge
opportunity for her.

135
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,489
This is ridiculous.

136
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:42,256
You'd think they'd
discourage people
from bringing in balloons.

137
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:45,358
Hey, I think this guy
playing Sweeney Todd
is my plumber.

138
00:06:45,435 --> 00:06:49,371
No, Darryl. This guy's
a world-class actor.

139
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,270
He doesn't daylight
as your plumber.

140
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:53,775
No, it's my plumber.
Says so in his bio.

141
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:56,244
Apparently, the director
discovered him doing karaoke.

142
00:06:56,313 --> 00:06:58,679
It's his first play.
He didn't even audition.

143
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:00,477
Are you kidding me?
Shh.

144
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,812
If we don't
listen to the overture,

145
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,113
we won't recognize
the musical themes

146
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:04,278
when they come back later.

147
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:05,821
All right, I'm sorry.

148
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,889
God.

149
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,950
Attend the tale
Of Sweeney Todd

150
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:15,329
His skin was pale
And his eye was odd

151
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,963
He shaved the faces
Of gentlemen

152
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,502
Who never thereafter
Were heard of again

153
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,505
He trod a path
That few have trod

154
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,404
Did Sweeney Todd

155
00:07:26,443 --> 00:07:29,276
The demon barber
Of Fleet Street

156
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,809
He kept a shop
In London town

157
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:39,617
Excuse me,
I think you may be
in the wrong seats.

158
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,686
What if none of
Their souls were saved

159
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,820
They went to their
Maker impeccably shaved

160
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,262
By Sweeney

161
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,564
By Sweeney Todd

162
00:07:52,335 --> 00:07:54,997
The demon barber
Of Fleet Street

163
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:02,444
I feel you

164
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:05,811
Johanna

165
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:10,319
I feel you

166
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:12,685
I was half convinced
I waited

167
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:14,348
I work with that guy.

168
00:08:14,424 --> 00:08:18,121
Satisfied enough
To dream you

169
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:21,630
Happily I was mistaken

170
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:24,667
Johanna

171
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:29,796
Oh!
There's gum on the seat,
and now it's on my work skirt.

172
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:31,602
I have to go change.

173
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:34,200
Too bad I'm not gonna
explain anything
that you miss.

174
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:36,074
Oh, Dwight, just move.

175
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:41,242
Do they think that
walls can hide you?

176
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:45,415
His name's Andy.
He's a terrible salesman.

177
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:49,015
I am in the dark beside you

178
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:52,825
What time is it?

179
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:01,665
Michael!

180
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:03,699
Shelby Thomas Weems,
the director.

181
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:04,899
Hello.

182
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:08,001
I promise you that if
you keep auditioning

183
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:09,739
with a similar gusto...
Okay.

184
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:13,647
we are going to
find a production
with a role for Michael Scott.

185
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:14,843
Okay.
Yes?

186
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:15,942
Yes.
Good.

187
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,281
Good.
Enjoy the second act.

188
00:09:17,354 --> 00:09:18,616
You enjoy the second act.
Have a refreshment.

189
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:20,019
Thank you. You, too.

190
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:22,220
Thank you, thank you.

191
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,220
Come on, Dwight.

192
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,664
Why are you dressed
like a seed catalog model?

193
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,493
These are just my dirty
old gardening clothes.

194
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:34,230
They were all
that I had in my car.

195
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:35,566
Let's go.

196
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:42,444
Hey, Erin, it's Pam.
Hey, how you doing...

197
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:44,742
No, no, don't put Cece
on the phone, because
she can't talk yet.

198
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:49,373
Okay. No, I was
just calling to see
how everything's going.

199
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:51,249
Yeah? Yeah? It's good?

200
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:54,690
The play?
The play is kind of great.

201
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:59,023
I mean,
it's fun to hear Andy sing
in the appropriate setting.

202
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:02,258
No, he's really sorry
you couldn't make it, too.

203
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:06,200
Yeah.
So thank you so much again.
We're having a great time.

204
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,931
Oh, they're
flashing the lights,
so we should go in.

205
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,404
Thanks. Bye.

206
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:12,771
Okay, so we called,
and everything's fine.

207
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:14,070
Everything's fine.

208
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:15,168
We can relax.

209
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:16,803
We can relax.
Let's get our Sweeney on.

210
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,372
Then I go
Walking with you-hoo

211
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,974
You-hoo

212
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:25,385
I warm me bones
On the esplanade

213
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:28,424
Have tea and scones
With me gay young blade

214
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:29,515
Hey, Michael!

215
00:10:29,592 --> 00:10:32,254
I'll knit a sweater
While you write a letter

216
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:35,923
Unless we've
Got better to do-hoo

217
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:38,126
Anything you say

218
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:42,164
Think how snug it'll be
Underneath our flannel

219
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:45,605
When it's just you and me
And the English Channel

220
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:48,974
In our cozy retreat
Kept all neat and tidy

221
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,912
We'll have chums
Over ev'ry Friday

222
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,471
By the sea

223
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,676
Anything you say

224
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:58,118
Don't you love the weather

225
00:10:58,922 --> 00:11:00,514
Just checking my e-mails.

226
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,082
See if I got any
last-minute "break-a-legs"

227
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,390
or "l-still-Iove-you"
type texts.

228
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:13,260
Doesn't look
like I got anything.
Maybe on my Facebook wall.

229
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:21,800
Unfortunately, in this
ham-fisted production
of Sweeney Todd,

230
00:11:21,878 --> 00:11:24,574
the real terror
comes from the
vocal performances.

231
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:25,841
New paragraph.

232
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:28,713
Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd!
I found her!

233
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:31,782
You found Johanna.

234
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:34,449
That monster of
a judge has locked her...

236
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:39,988

üMUSICAL TONE

238
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,766
There's a little
bird fluttering around.
Do hope it ceases chirping.

239
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:53,403
How is that funny?

240
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:57,503
The bird continues to call.
Someone please
turn off your bird.

242
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:02,614
Oh, for the love...
Turn your phone off!
There are signs!

243
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:03,777
Oh!

244
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:08,519
It appears the bird
was in mine own pocket
this whole time.

245
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:11,185
He's gone to sleep now.
I closed his beak.

246
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:16,425
What is the news
of my darling
daughter Johanna?

You know what?
Let me just double check.

249
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,567
Make sure that bird...

250
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:26,541
Okay, good. It's off.

251
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,939
I mean, silenced.
I silenced it by killing it.

252
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:34,814
I've killed it!
I'm a murderer!
Just like you, Sweeney Todd!

253
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,351
See? It all connects.

254
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:40,147
Not that I know
you're a murderer.

255
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,747
My character
doesn't know that yet.

256
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,723
But I'm suspicious,
because of all the razors
that you have laying around.

257
00:12:48,798 --> 00:12:50,459
And you spend time alone,

258
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:53,397
but you're a barber,
so that's legit.

259
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,903
So there's that.

260
00:12:55,972 --> 00:12:57,098
But...

261
00:12:57,173 --> 00:12:58,504
Where is Johanna?

262
00:12:58,575 --> 00:12:59,701
A madhouse.
A madhouse?

263
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:01,767
Yes, a madhouse.

264
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,244
A madhouse?

265
00:13:03,313 --> 00:13:05,042
Johanna is as good
as rescued.

266
00:13:05,114 --> 00:13:06,809
Where do you suppose
all the wig makers

267
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:09,681
of London go to
obtain their human hair?

268
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,276
Do you think...

269
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:14,179
So you think...

270
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:26,165
So you think...
Fogg's Asylum, why not?

271
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:33,405
Sounds like Cece.

272
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:35,808
Okay, I think everybody
just needs to relax.

273
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:36,868
Oh, my God. Go, go.

274
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,038
Oh, my God.

275
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:49,420
That's really
irresponsible of Erin.
She's a terrible babysitter.

276
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:54,896
I just didn't think
you guys were
gonna see us.

277
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,898
We were just gonna
stop by and then
get some ice cream

278
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:57,990
and then go home.

279
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,100
Okay, this was
pretty simple. Right?

280
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:01,193
Why are you here?

281
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,102
All you had to do
was play with her

282
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:04,969
for, like, 30 minutes
and then put her to bed.

283
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,975
Then we were kind of
hoping that you wouldn't
touch her again.

284
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:08,840
Babies shouldn't have
ice cream, by the way.

285
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:12,371
I'm sorry. I just...
I really wanted to see Andy.

286
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:13,847
You guys made it
sound so un-missable,

287
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:16,010
and you set me
up with a car seat
and everything.

288
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,610
Well, the car seat
was to take her
to the hospital or...

289
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:20,985
But why would I take
her to the hospital?

290
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:24,059
You know what,
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

291
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:26,755
Why don't I
just take her home,
and let you guys finish,

292
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:28,694
and then you should
stay out as late
as you want.

293
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:30,630
No, we're good.
Thank you, though.

294
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,826
Yeah.
Thanks.

295
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:33,960
Okay. All right, bye, Cece.

296
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:36,398
Okay.
All right.

297
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,198
Well, we're never
leaving the house again.

298
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:39,298
Not together.

299
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:09,263
That was more
horrifying than Nunsense.

300
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:10,499
All that singing
got in the way

301
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:12,734
of some perfectly
good murders.

302
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,541
Where's my car?

303
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:25,845
Come on.

304
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,824
Mmm!
Fruit is so much
better when it's dried.

305
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:32,588
I've already eaten,
like, 30 apricots.

306
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:33,686
Darryl?

307
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:34,752
Hey!

308
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,230
Didn't know you
were gonna be here.

309
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:37,891
How's the toilet?
Silent.

310
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,662
Look, congratulations.
Thank you.

311
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:43,263
I had no idea.
This plumber has pipes.

312
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:45,500
Yeah, good job. Well done.

313
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,201
You're the guy
who booed me.

314
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,904
Mmm-mmm.

315
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,307
No, there were a lot
of people booing you.
I wasn't one of them.

316
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:54,976
No, I saw you,
and you were the only one.

317
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:56,985
Get your eyes checked,
chucklehead.

318
00:15:57,053 --> 00:16:00,318
Be cool, Michael.
I saw this guy kill
a bunch of people.

319
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,255
Good work.
Thank you.

320
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:06,786
You didn't have to boo him.

321
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,763
He was getting
a lot of applause,

322
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:10,458
and I just didn't
think it was indicative

323
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:11,864
of how people
were really feeling.

324
00:16:11,934 --> 00:16:13,231
How would you like
it if we booed you?

325
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:15,202
That would never happen.

326
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:16,498
Okay.

327
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:18,166
I appreciate the feedback.

328
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,369
I don't like that at all.

329
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,638
Are you ready?

330
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:27,842
Yes.

331
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:30,613
I'm so scared!
Okay, kill me!
Just kill me! Kill me!

332
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:35,490
Blood everywhere.
Oh, no.

333
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:38,785
I'm so glad we're hanging
out again outside of work.

334
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:40,123
Yeah, me, too.

335
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:42,686
Okay, I kill you now.

336
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:43,754
Okay.

337
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,292
All right.

338
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:47,828
All right, let's do this.

339
00:16:47,904 --> 00:16:50,805
You know, actually, Dwight,
I didn't realize how far
this walk was,

340
00:16:50,873 --> 00:16:52,135
and I'm exhausted.

341
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,402
It's okay, I smell.

342
00:16:53,476 --> 00:16:55,808
No. No, no, no. I think
I just want to go home,

343
00:16:55,878 --> 00:16:58,472
but it's okay.
This can count as
one of your times.

344
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,812
No, no, no.
Contractually, we're
obligated to have sex.

345
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,543
Well, I won't
tell if you don't.

346
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:04,449
I will tell.
I will tell the mediator.

347
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:09,950
What...
What are you... Oh, okay.

348
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,251
Oh, was that in the way?
Get rid of it. Oh!

349
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:16,126
Good night, Dwight.

350
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:24,103
Good night.

351
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:30,342
These would have
been your seats.
Best seats in the house.

352
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:33,576
Lot of people think it
would be the front row,
but, actually, right here,

353
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:36,174
this is where
the speakers converge

354
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:39,050
and the sound just,
like, nails you right here.

355
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:40,714
This is awesome.

356
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,018
Oh.

357
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,251
Sorry. Oh.
Oh.

358
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:44,717
Hi, Gabe.

359
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:49,759
Yeah, I just stopped
by Andy's cast party
to say hi to everyone.

360
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:53,063
Sure, I can pick you up
some soup. What do you want?

361
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,865
That's broth, Gabe.

362
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,632
Okay, I'll see you soup.

363
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,975
Okay, I have to go.
Thank you so much.

364
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:03,807
This was so much fun,
and I'm really sorry
that I missed your play,

365
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,939
but next time,
I'll be there.

366
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,983
Or here.
Right here, I promise.

367
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,540
Awesome.
Okay.

368
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:11,177
See you later.

369
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:12,585
Thank you.

370
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,361
It's like The Hurt Locker.

371
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:24,729
This night was a disaster.

372
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,961
No, it was not a disaster.

373
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:29,061
It was weird,
but it wasn't a disaster.

374
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:33,407
I think we have, like,
a gift bottle of Irish Cream.

375
00:18:33,476 --> 00:18:35,239
Yeah?
We could put that
in orange juice.

376
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,437
Get it.
Yeah?

377
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,446
Let's get our juice on.
Yeah.

378
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,182
PHYLLIS: Found him.

379
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:47,214
Hey, what's going on here?
Post-show blues?

380
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,757
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

381
00:18:48,824 --> 00:18:50,849
Yeah, I get those
every day after work.

382
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:52,360
Your show was
really great, Andy.

383
00:18:52,428 --> 00:18:55,556
Interesting subject matter.
I'm surprised
you pulled it off.

384
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:57,863
It was like amateur hour.

385
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,526
It was an amateur production,
technically.

386
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:03,766
Oscar,
enough with the sass, please!
God! What is wrong with you?

387
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,431
Andy, listen to me.

388
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:06,873
Look me in the eye.

389
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,741
I thought that
you were awesome.

390
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:09,869
Stop just saying that.

391
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:11,345
I am not just saying that.

392
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:13,405
You can trust that I am
telling you the truth.

393
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:16,474
I booed someone tonight.
I have no filter.

394
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:18,918
And if I thought
you were terrible,
I would have booed.

395
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:20,751
And if I thought you
had done a better job,

396
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:23,519
I would be saying
nicer things right now.

397
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:26,494
But I thought that you
were exactly awesome.

398
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:28,325
No better, no worse.

399
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,393
Thank you.
That feels good.

400
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:35,927
I did not say that
to make you feel good.
I just said it.

401
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,597
Total integrity.

402
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:39,300
DARRYL: Andy,
sing us another song.

403
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,138
Thanks, but I feel
like a Ioner right now.

404
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,575
Come on, Andy.
You were the highlight.

405
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:43,942
Come on, Andy, seriously.

406
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:45,173
Andy! Andy!

407
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,340
ALL: Andy!

408
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:48,474
Andy! Andy!

409
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:50,075
Okay, all right.

410
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:53,713
I try to say goodbye
And I choke

411
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:56,383
Try to walk away
And I stumble

412
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:58,723
Though I try to hide it
It's clear

413
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,695
My world crumbles
When you are not here

414
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:07,567
I play it off but
I'm dreaming of you

415
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:10,970
I keep my cool
But I'm fiending

416
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,066
ALL:
I try to say goodbye
And I choke

417
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,172
Try to walk away
And I stumble

418
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:19,908
Though I try to hide it
It's clear

419
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:23,577
My world crumbles
When you are not near

420
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:25,951
My world

421
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:27,613
It crumbles

422
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,592
When you are not here

423
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,367
In the criminal
justice system,

424
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:52,437
the people are represented
by two separate
yet equally important groups,

425
00:20:52,515 --> 00:20:53,948
the police who
investigate the crimes,

426
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:56,712
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

427
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:58,083
These are their stories.

428
00:21:01,757 --> 00:21:04,123
I'm just a cleaning lady.

429
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,160
A dead body!

430
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:08,894
He wrapped his belt
around his own neck.

431
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:12,127
It looks like a classic case
of autoerotic asphyxiation.

432
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:15,500
Yeah, looks like everybody's
tightening their
belts in this economy.

433
00:21:15,571 --> 00:21:17,471
üHUMMING LAW & ORDER THEMEä

434
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,669
Last time you saw the victim,
was he happy?

435
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:25,339
Last time I saw
this John he was...

436
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:27,348
He wasn't a victim,
if you know what
I'm talking about.

437
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,644
DIRECTOR: Thank you.
No!

438
00:21:28,718 --> 00:21:30,743
That was just part...
I was just getting
into the first act.
