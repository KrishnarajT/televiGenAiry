1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,900
What about this one?
It's kind of badass, right?

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:08,501
It just seems kind
of crazy in a way
I might need right now.

3
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:13,341
I don't know.
Oh, that's not yours.

4
00:00:13,615 --> 00:00:16,015
JIM: Stanley just
drank OJ out of my mug

5
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:19,679
and didn't seem to realize
that it wasn't his hot coffee.

6
00:00:19,788 --> 00:00:22,086
So, the question
has to be asked,

7
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:25,320
is there no limit to
what he won't notice?

8
00:00:25,894 --> 00:00:28,021
What's a seven-letter
word for purse?

9
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:30,392
Satchel.

10
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:32,329
No. Starts with an "H."

11
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,629
Handbag!

12
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:36,193
Hmm, thank you.

13
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:39,696
Shh.

14
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,447
All right, everybody.
Take a seat.

15
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:55,781
As you may have heard,
our branch on
the planet Jupiter

16
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,222
is up 8,000% in sales.

17
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:06,465
Hold up.
That clock is slow.
It is 5:00.

18
00:01:07,202 --> 00:01:08,794
I will see you all
tomorrow.

19
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:10,236
Bye, Stanley,
love you.

20
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:15,367
So long, Stanley.

21
00:01:15,444 --> 00:01:16,843
Night, everybody.

22
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:44,663
So, what kind of
statement are you making

23
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,037
with that costume,
Kevin?

24
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,541
Well, the statement
that I am making, Oscar,

25
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,942
is I kind of look
like Michael Moore.

26
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,179
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Erin.

27
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:56,911
Happy Halloween.
How can I haunt you today?

28
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:59,451
A lot of people are
really getting into
Halloween this year.

29
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,988
Six seconds, MacGruber.

30
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:02,921
Pam's got a lot of
fun stuff planned...

31
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,021
Two seconds, MacGruber.

32
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:08,256
Including a costume contest
and bobbing for apples

33
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:09,758
and a ouija board.

34
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:12,129
Oh! Boom!
Oh! Explosion!

35
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:13,858
MacGruber!

36
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:17,264
People are really into
the costume contest
this year.

37
00:02:17,773 --> 00:02:20,401
Might have something
to do with the prize.
Maybe you've heard of it?

38
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:23,307
The 2011
Scranton-Wilkes-Barre
coupon book,

39
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,779
worth over
$15,000 in savings.

40
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:30,341
Stop.
Too late.

41
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:33,979
If I was the real
Scranton Strangler,
you'd be so strangled by now.

42
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:36,886
And if you're out there,
Strangler, you will
get caught.

43
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,483
By me.

44
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:40,388
Sounds like
someone's really trying
to convince us

45
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:41,986
that he's not
the Scranton Strangler.

46
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,827
To my chickens,
I'm the Scranton Strangler.

47
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:47,402
DWIGHT: Oh-ho.
That's very funny.

48
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:50,468
Looks like someone
decided to dress up as
old Dwight Schrute's mom.

49
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:52,435
What?
You're only one-third
as beautiful

50
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:53,769
and about
half her height.

51
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,642
I am supposed to be Olive Oyl.
And it makes more sense

52
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:58,839
when I'm standing
next to Popeye,

53
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:01,382
but Jim doesn't
wanna put his costume on.

54
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,844
I am Popeye.

55
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:05,618
I've never really
been a costume guy.

56
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,415
Even when I was a kid,
it just felt like
something I was too old for.

57
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:13,994
And then this morning,
Pam hands me
this little number.

58
00:03:14,763 --> 00:03:15,787
No.

59
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:20,728
In case you can't read
my, my, my poker face,

60
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:22,803
We will be reviewing
our sales policies.

61
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:27,438
I have 10 seconds to
explain them or this
whole place blows up.

62
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:28,999
MacGruber!

63
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:31,003
Lame.

64
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,274
Why don't
witches wear panties?

65
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:34,473
Oh, here we go.

66
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,513
Because they need
to grip the broom.

67
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:42,579
Oh! Who likes to
water-ski on Lake Eerie?
No, wait.

68
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,019
Where does Dracula
like to water-ski?

69
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:45,252
Lake Eerie.

70
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,295
When our warehouse workers
make deliveries,

71
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:50,388
they're gonna be
encouraged to offer clients
extra products.

72
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:52,429
And then they will
split those commissions
with sales.

73
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,061
Wait,
so drivers are gonna be able
to sell paper on the road?

74
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:56,126
That is correct.

75
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,262
Has anyone started
calling you
Gabe-wad yet?

76
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,631
Not here, no.

77
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,766
Gabe-wad.

78
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,310
GABE: Okay, guys.
Fun is fun, but...

79
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:06,836
Blackula.

80
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:08,007
Dracula.

81
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,813
Oh, so,
and I almost forgot,

82
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:12,378
you'll find this
hilarious.

83
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:16,655
Apparently corporate
is going to have drivers

84
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:19,250
sell paper on
their routes now.

85
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:22,195
That's, like, exactly
sort of the idea
that you had.

86
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:26,126
Yes, I do remember saying
something like that to you.

87
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:27,834
Yeah.

88
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:29,893
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,594
I blew this.

90
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:33,240
You should have gotten
credit for that, man.

91
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:34,705
I'm just glad
we're gonna try it out.

92
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:35,902
Really? We're good?

93
00:04:36,078 --> 00:04:37,102
We're cool.

94
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,476
Okay.

95
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:40,274
Okay.
What's that
in your shirt?

96
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:41,874
Oh.

97
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,545
That's a ream of paper.
I thought you might hit me.

98
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,886
Darryl Philbin
is the greatest guy
in the world.

99
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,417
And you know
what I'd like?

100
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:55,826
I would like to have
all the racists
brought together,

101
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:58,627
and take Darryl Philbin
out to lunch,

102
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,361
just to see what
they're missing.

103
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:01,825
It's a great stick, right?

104
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:02,927
RYAN:
It's really good.

105
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:05,539
A classic.
I feel like you might win
the whole thing with that.

106
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:07,708
Thanks.
OSCAR:
Everyone realizes

107
00:05:07,776 --> 00:05:10,973
this coupon book
is not actually worth
$15,000, right?

108
00:05:11,046 --> 00:05:13,776
You'd have to spend $200,000
on crap you don't even need

109
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,774
to get $15,000
worth of benefits.

110
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,216
I'm not the only one
who sees this, right?
RYAN: No.

111
00:05:18,286 --> 00:05:19,275
Well, sure.
No.

112
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:20,343
No.

113
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:21,411
I get that.
I get that.

114
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,089
Uh, excuse me,
everyone?

115
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:26,457
I wanna invite you all
to the Halloween party
I'm having at my bar.

116
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:27,990
You own a bar?

117
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:30,130
Public School,
at exit 11.

118
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:34,431
That's a great name.
You're hilarious.

119
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:36,426
A plus!

120
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,905
So, you're all on the list.

121
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:41,999
Hey, man,
can I get a plus five?
It's all guys.

122
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:44,772
Hey, what's the crowd like,
Danny? Our age?

123
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:45,902
Okay.

124
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,946
I don't think that
she would leave
Jim for Danny.

125
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,042
I don't know.
They're both handsome.

126
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,281
Pam is gonna choose
whoever has a scent
most like that of her father.

127
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:57,825
Does anyone remember
what her dad smelled like?

128
00:05:58,059 --> 00:05:59,185
I think he...

129
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:00,353
Hey, hey, gang, quiet.
Here she comes.

130
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,197
Did you hear
about that Danny guy?
Heard he used to date Pam.

131
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,995
So, four years ago,
when I was in Stamford,
Connecticut,

132
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:11,698
and dating someone else,
Pam went on
two dates with Danny,

133
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:14,173
which was obviously
the greatest
love story ever told,

134
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:16,267
given how much people
are walking
on eggshells around us.

135
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,505
We were basically
Romeo and Juliet.
That's right.

136
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,480
Except where
Juliet doesn't have
that great a time

137
00:06:20,549 --> 00:06:22,642
and Romeo doesn't
call back
after two dates.

138
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:23,775
Yikes.

139
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,581
But I've learned
to love again.

140
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:28,623
He's a cartoon sailor,
Oh! No.

141
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,954
And he looks so handsome
in his uniform.
No.

142
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:32,015
Please!
No, I'm not gonna... No.

143
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,826
Tuna! Tuna!

144
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,555
If you want us to
skip this party...

145
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:38,721
I don't care.

146
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,598
KEVIN:
I am never gonna forget
what Danny did to Pam.

147
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:43,464
I forget nothing.

148
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,131
I'm like an elephant
in that way.

149
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:46,231
You know what else?

150
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:49,277
This sucks for Jim, right?

151
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:50,936
But it also sucks for us

152
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:53,674
because we don't get invited
to a ton of Halloween parties.

153
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:56,376
Yeah. And like,
everyone's
gonna be there.

154
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:58,110
Stanley,

155
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,175
Phyllis,

156
00:06:59,254 --> 00:07:00,448
Angela,

157
00:07:00,522 --> 00:07:01,819
Darryl...

158
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,982
Creed's a maybe.
Creed's going?

159
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:10,425
Madge from the warehouse
just made her first sale.

160
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:13,900
Madge! We should
have been doing this
a long time ago.

161
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:21,398
Erin? Would you
please do me a solid,

162
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:24,673
and get Darryl Philbin
on the speakerphone?

163
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,041
Hello?

164
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,745
Hi, Darryl,
come out here, please.

165
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:33,845
I'm good.

166
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,521
You need to stop
being so shy,

167
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,457
come out here and embrace
who you really are, superstar.

168
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:39,789
This is embarrassing,
Michael.

169
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,953
MICHAEL:
Yeah, I bet it is.

170
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,929
You're gonna do
your job well here,

171
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:44,829
you gotta get used
to being embarrassed.

172
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,197
Well, let me put
my shoes on.

173
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:51,228
Hit the speakerphone button.

174
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,975
The speakerphone button.

175
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,667
Same button as
you hit before.

176
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:57,737
Same...
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Your call cannot...

177
00:07:57,812 --> 00:07:58,801
Or sit on it.

178
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,847
This whole
delivery slash sales idea,
you know whose that was?

179
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:04,077
That was Darryl Philbin's.

180
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,153
He thought of that way before
the corporate fatsuits.

181
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,324
So, what happened?
I got in the way.

182
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,325
I said, "No,"

183
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,520
and it just stopped.

184
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:17,622
But then, corporate
comes up with this idea.

185
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,328
But you know what?
They need to know
that it was yours.

186
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,064
And I don't care
if I take a bullet.

187
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:24,469
We are going to
call them,

188
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:26,632
we are gonna put them on
speakerphone right now,
Oh. Oh.

189
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,537
And we are going to
straighten this out.

190
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:32,204
Screw corporate!
They probably
stole the idea anyway.

191
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,813
MICHAEL:
Mmm-hmm.
Uh.

192
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:35,041
Corporate stole nothing. Okay?

193
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,640
Darryl brought this
idea to me.

194
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:39,219
And then I told them,
giving Darryl full credit. So,

195
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,216
no need to
"screw corporate."

196
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:44,083
Everyone, let's give Darryl
a round of applause
as planned.

197
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:51,089
I'm a little peeved
at Darryl right now.

198
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,724
He went to Gabe
behind your back!

199
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,428
No, he didn't
go behind my back.
He went over my head.

200
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:57,903
He went over your head
to go behind your back.

201
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,198
What is taking
someone from behind?

202
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,537
No. Shh.
Michael, listen.

203
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,078
This cannot stand.
You can't have workers
going straight to corporate.

204
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:05,339
It makes your
job superfluous.

205
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:06,778
It was a good idea, though.

206
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:10,681
Yeah,
here's another good idea,
corporate chain of command.

207
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,148
We need to
strangle Darryl's idea.

208
00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:17,219
Hey, Danny.
Hey.

209
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:20,551
I'm really sorry,
but we can't come to
your party tonight.

210
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,687
I was looking forward
to throwing some
darts with you guys.

211
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:23,955
You were?
Okay, well then...

212
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:27,524
I mean, maybe we
could do it like,
next Halloween?

213
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:28,725
For sure.
We're just, like,

214
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:30,437
totally caught in
the middle here.

215
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:31,631
What are you
talking about?

216
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,701
Well, Jim and Pam
basically begged us
not to go.

217
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:36,637
Jim and Pam really
don't want you to go?

218
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,138
They're really upset about
the whole Danny situation.

219
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:41,408
I'll talk to 'em.

220
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,975
Yeah, but do you know what?
Don't tell them that
we said anything to you.

221
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,844
Okay.

222
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,286
Okay? Or you're dead.

223
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,379
Okay.

224
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:50,480
Okay.

225
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:55,387
Kelly!
Great costume.

226
00:09:56,364 --> 00:10:00,198
Kelly!
You cannot change costumes
in the middle of the day!

227
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,393
Pam, she's out.

228
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:05,268
If I'm out, I'm gonna
sue this entire company
for discrimination.

229
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:07,898
Guys, you're arguing over
a one-in-sixteen chance,

230
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:10,534
over a prize worth $40.

231
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,212
Fifteen thousand
bucks, Oscar.

232
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,679
Yeah, shut it,
Oscar. Pam?

233
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,439
This is an amazing prize.

234
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:17,508
I mean, I don't even wanna
give Pam a compliment,

235
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:21,112
'cause she's so, ugh...
But she did a good job.

236
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:22,281
I really want
that coupon book.

237
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,918
Garbage magnet.
Garbage magnet.

238
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:27,187
God! Magnets are
interesting enough,

239
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:30,288
you don't need to
tart 'em up
with some design.

240
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:33,560
I can't believe this
doesn't make you mad.

241
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:35,101
What the hell are
they talking about?

242
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:39,269
Hmm. Kevin and Gabe?
Probably about the extremes
of the human physique.

243
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:41,103
Do you think Kevin
is going over my head?

244
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,769
I don't... Oh, my God.
Okay. All right,
all right, all right.

245
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:47,713
You know what?
That's inappropriate, Kevin.

246
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:48,840
I am your boss.

247
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:51,283
And if you have
something to say,
it goes through me,

248
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:52,715
and then I
take it to Gabe.

249
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,477
Chain of command.
Do you understand?

250
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,318
I am so sorry.
Oh, you're sorry?

251
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,085
I just thought...
What did you
just thought?

252
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,490
Well, Gabe asked me
if there were

253
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:03,224
any really cool
Lady Gaga moves

254
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,798
that he could do
for the catwalk.

255
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,024
And so, then I told...

256
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:08,493
All right.

257
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:10,696
I told him that there
was this one cool move

258
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:13,035
where she powers down
like a robot.

259
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:14,130
Okay.

260
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:16,040
Okay?
But I'm so sorry
that...

261
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:17,305
All right.
I didn't tell you first.

262
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:19,505
Well, don't let it
happen again.

263
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,141
You think that I would
let this happen again?

264
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,911
No way, Jose!

265
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:25,710
Um.

266
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:29,053
you, Gabe.

267
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:32,950
Can you imagine?
It's just crazy.

268
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,085
JIM: That is crazy.

269
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,421
We would never care
if Andy or Kevin
went to your party.

270
00:11:36,498 --> 00:11:38,591
Look, I'm just glad
we can laugh about it,

271
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,168
because I was a little nervous
about coming to work here,

272
00:11:41,236 --> 00:11:42,669
with, you know,
our history.

273
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:45,169
Oh, my gosh.
Everyone keeps blowing that
out of proportion.

274
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,299
It's not even a history.
Exactly.

275
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:50,104
It's not like
you guys had some
long relationship, right?

276
00:11:50,845 --> 00:11:51,971
Big painful breakup
I don't know about?

277
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,138
No!

278
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:54,676
Two or three dates.
It was two.

279
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,448
Was it two?
I thought it was three.

280
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:59,248
No, we had plans
for a third,

281
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,811
but then, I don't know,
you never called me back.
So...

282
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,414
Oh! You can't
handle the truth!

283
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:06,457
Well, that does not
sound like me.

284
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:08,962
Yeah. It was, though.
That's what happened.

285
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,157
Uh.

286
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:14,665
Well, great,
I just wanted to make sure
things weren't weird.

287
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:15,995
Uh-uh.

288
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,131
Okay. This whole
going over my head gate

289
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,675
is making people act weird.

290
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,139
Chain of command
is crumbling.

291
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,338
Do you know
what just happened?
I just made Kevin cry.

292
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:29,877
And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga.
That's not Halloween.

293
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:33,312
Halloween should
be a day in which
we honor monsters

294
00:12:33,388 --> 00:12:34,650
and not be mad
at each other.

295
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,451
I'm not mad.
Are you mad?

296
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:39,059
You went over my head,
and then you lied to my face.

297
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:41,561
So, my head and my face
have taken a beating.

298
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:44,421
Well, I'm sorry if it
seems that way to you.

299
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:45,624
Okay, that might help.

300
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,793
If you said "I'm sorry"
in front of everybody...

301
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:49,061
Mike.
in front of me.

302
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:52,265
You made a bad call
and I fixed it.

303
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:54,068
So, I'm not apologizing.

304
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,870
So, that's it?

305
00:12:56,311 --> 00:12:57,642
That's it.
Is it?

306
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:59,104
Yes.

307
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:03,673
Sookie!

308
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,183
Bill Compton
from True Blood.

309
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:11,453
How many freaking vampires
am I supposed to
care about these days?

310
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,657
Well, I guess you could say
I'm still in costume.

311
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:16,524
I'm a rational
"consumer."

312
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,460
Oh. Oh, yeah.
So, it's...

313
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,727
This stupid
coupon booklet.

314
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,463
Have you seen my costume?
I'm a rational "consumer."

315
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,974
Yeah, I heard you
say it to Phyllis.
That's a good line.

316
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,633
Okay, everybody.
After you walk the runway,

317
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:33,180
everyone has to vote for
who gets the coupon book.

318
00:13:33,248 --> 00:13:34,613
And you can't
vote for yourself.

319
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,116
Pam, can you vote
for other people?

320
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:40,211
Hey, I gotta get in on this.
Hey, it's cool, man.

321
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:43,382
I work in the warehouse.
I'm cool!

322
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:45,321
I'm hip and I'm jive!

323
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,753
But I don't care
about nobody!

324
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,428
Do you know who I am?

325
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:52,431
Happy Halloween, jerk!

326
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:54,828
Still don't know
who I am?

327
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,602
I'll give you a hint.

328
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,734
I go over other
people's heads.

329
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,202
Michael, this is
a bad idea.

330
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,469
What's a bad idea?

331
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,576
Dressing up as somebody.
I mean, when has that
ever worked for you?

332
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:05,701
Never!

333
00:14:06,547 --> 00:14:09,345
Okay, you know what, fine.
I'm not Darryl.

334
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:11,279
And thank God
I'm not Darryl.

335
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:13,579
Could you have for once
just let us enjoy a party,

336
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:15,418
instead of making it
about all your issues?

337
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:26,856
That's a warrior!

338
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:36,900
I present to you
the rational "consumer,"

339
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:38,434
as it were.

340
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:48,251
TODD: Slow, nice
and slow, honey.

341
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:49,551
PAM:
Angela as a nurse.

342
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:51,284
Don't... No,
slow it down.
CREED: There it is.

343
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,416
ANGELA:
I don't like your tone.

344
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,629
Look, they were sold out
of all the other costumes,
okay?

345
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:59,433
I think we all live
in the real world here.

346
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:03,026
Let's not pretend
to be unaware of what
sells in this office.

347
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,229
PHYLLIS:
What should we ask?

348
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:05,863
Hey, can I play?

349
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:09,569
Why don't you ask if
Darryl is a bad friend

350
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:10,974
who backstabs
people in the back?

351
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:14,279
We have one question
to ask the spirit world and
you want us to ask that?

352
00:15:14,983 --> 00:15:16,143
He says no.

353
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,980
Uh, Darryl moved it.
You moved it.

354
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,176
No.

355
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:20,777
Hey, Dwight, you saw
Darryl move it, right?

356
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:25,685
Let's just say I saw exactly
what the two of you
wanted me to see.

357
00:15:25,827 --> 00:15:27,818
I know how to
sit on a fence.

358
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:30,489
Hell, I can even
sleep on a fence.

359
00:15:30,565 --> 00:15:33,796
The trick is to
do it face down with
the post in your mouth.

360
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:36,297
If you had one word
you would use
to describe Darryl,

361
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:37,838
what would
that word be?

362
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,665
ERIN: A...

363
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:43,132
S...

364
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:44,767
S...

365
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:49,743
H... No!

366
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,212
Uh. E...

367
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,809
T.

368
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:55,047
An asset.

369
00:15:58,726 --> 00:15:59,715
That's enough.

370
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:05,856
I don't think
it's gonna work out
the way you think.

371
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:07,495
I don't think
you get it.

372
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,005
Hey.
Hey.

373
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,232
This is some party, huh?

374
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,571
When you work hard,
you play hard around here.

375
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:16,667
Even if you
don't work hard.

376
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:20,875
Oh, here's something.

377
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,040
Uh.

378
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:24,914
Why didn't you
ever call Pam back?

379
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:26,175
Serious?

380
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:30,213
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying
that everybody has to
fall in love or anything.

381
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,518
I'm just saying,
but...
To, you know,

382
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:33,025
to not even
call her back is...

383
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:35,654
You know what it was?
I think she
gave me her number,

384
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,755
but then, her fours
look like eights and...

385
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:38,856
Could be.

386
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:42,334
But you also
called her the second time,
so you had the number right.

387
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:43,392
TODD: Halpert,

388
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:45,939
you looking for
someone to bang your wife?

389
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,405
No.
Okay.

390
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:49,865
You want to know?

391
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:53,547
I didn't call her back
because she spent
the whole date

392
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:54,740
talking about you.

393
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,078
She was obviously
in love with you.

394
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:01,821
Fifty-seven,
fifty-eight...

395
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,516
Wait, wait.
She hasn't moved in a while.

396
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:05,116
Erin!

397
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:08,162
Two! I got two!
I ate two whole apples!

398
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,234
I'd remember
talking about Jim.
That wasn't it.

399
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:17,804
Just tell her
the real reason.

400
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:20,230
Do you honestly wanna know
why I didn't call her back

401
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:21,707
on a date
over four years ago?

402
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,004
Hey, she had
a nice time.

403
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:24,066
It seems rude.
Well...

404
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,772
I did. Yeah,
and it's one
of those things

405
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,405
that's just gonna
keep gnawing at me.

406
00:17:27,815 --> 00:17:30,750
Like, gnaw, gnaw...
"Why? Why didn't he?
I have no idea why."

407
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:33,546
Okay, honestly,
I didn't call you back

408
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:35,884
because I just thought
you seemed a little

409
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:36,981
dorky.

410
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,593
Hey, man...
Thank you!

411
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,256
Thank you. I got it.

412
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:45,899
Now I know.

413
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,269
You thought I was
a little dorky.
You know?

414
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:56,635
Okay. Well, excuse me.

415
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:01,371
In the future, you need to get
Michael's approval on anything

416
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:03,178
before coming to me.
Thank you.

417
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,116
You're gonna miss out
on some good ideas.

418
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,979
Okay, well, obviously if it's
a really, really good idea,

419
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:09,181
then my door is open.

420
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,815
If they're good ideas,
I'm not gonna say, "No."

421
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:12,983
You said, "No"
to this one.

422
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,494
That's... Okay, I make
one mistake in 15 years

423
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,087
and you drag me
over the coals.

424
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:18,289
After everything
I did for you?

425
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,355
What have you
done for me?

426
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:21,465
Oh, well...
What have you
done for me?

427
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,536
Ed Truck hired me.

428
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,037
Jo promoted me.

429
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:28,507
Gabe listened to me.
All you've ever done
was say, "No" to me.

430
00:18:31,212 --> 00:18:33,237
I have ambition,

431
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:35,248
and you kept me
at the same level
for years.

432
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:37,648
Dropping bombs, right?

433
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:40,746
This really make
you think, Michael?

434
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:43,381
Stop it. Stop. Stop.
We're thinking.

435
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:45,959
We're thinking about it.
GABE: Yeah.

436
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,325
You don't have to
point to the fact that
we're thinking about it.

437
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:49,987
Stop it.
Just let us think.

438
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:55,199
Okay, next time you
have a really great idea,

439
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:57,237
we will put it in a hat,

440
00:18:58,005 --> 00:19:00,803
and then we will have Erin
pick it out of the hat
and let her decide.

441
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,274
I don't understand
the point of a hat.

442
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,371
You're right,
we don't need a hat.

443
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:06,140
I am not budging
on the hat issue.

444
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,772
Okay, we're gonna
table the hat question.

445
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,316
The best ideas are
gonna come to me.

446
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,682
I make the
final decision,
period.

447
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:17,087
Okay, we both reserve
the right to go to Jo
if we disagree with Gabe.

448
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,117
Okay.
DARRYL: Fair enough.

449
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:22,191
Why don't we simplify this?
Darryl brings it to Michael,

450
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,958
Michael brings it to me,
no one calls Jo.

451
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,531
Unless you and I
decide we wanna talk to Jo,

452
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:29,661
then we'll give her a call.

453
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:31,328
Cool.

454
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:33,305
Hey, sorry I left.

455
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:35,568
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

456
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:38,642
MICHAEL: Friends fight.

457
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:40,940
Friends fight.

458
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:42,137
What's up, man?

459
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,014
Sometimes it seems
like it was better

460
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:45,347
down in the warehouse,
you know?

461
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,182
When I was
a freshman in college,

462
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,246
I worked at
the student newspaper,

463
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,450
the Cornell Daily Sun.
This was at Cornell.

464
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,824
I had to write
an op-ed column every day,
"Bernard's Regards."

465
00:19:55,363 --> 00:19:56,694
This was your
freshman year?

466
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:00,124
I started to ask myself,
do I have big plans here?

467
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,059
I didn't wanna become
editor of that paper, so

468
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:05,703
I got up
and walked right out
of Walter Bernard Hall,

469
00:20:06,073 --> 00:20:07,904
and that's actually
when I heard

470
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,109
eight male voices

471
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,474
singing,

472
00:20:12,213 --> 00:20:14,147
unencumbered
by instruments.

473
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,073
I was hooked.

474
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,211
So, is becoming
CEO of this company

475
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:23,817
your a cappella group?

476
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:27,551
Come on. We're going to
Danny's bar, Public School.

477
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:29,458
No, I got
some work to do.

478
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,092
I do have big plans
at this company.

479
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,528
ERIN: She...
It was fantastic.
Yeah.

480
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:36,126
It was like
a little gentle...

481
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:40,029
JIM: To be honest,
I still can't believe
he didn't call her back.

482
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,071
Who doesn't call
a dork like that back?

483
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,111
Oh! Wow!

484
00:20:48,282 --> 00:20:49,544
Spinach in a can!

485
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:50,948
Power from spinach!

486
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:52,110
Ag, ag, ag, ag, ag, ag!

487
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,380
Oh, my hero!

488
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:01,157
PAM: Okay, everyone,
I've tallied the votes,
and the winner

489
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,857
of the Costume
Celebration Spectacular

490
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,956
and the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre
coupon book,

491
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,193
Oscar Martinez.

492
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:09,625
PHYLLIS: Who?

493
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:14,406
If I have to vote
for someone,

494
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,670
I don't want it
to be someone
who can beat me.

495
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:20,442
Shake things up.
I'm a Nader guy.

496
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:25,285
Best Edward James Olmos
costume I've ever seen.

497
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:28,015
Like, freaky good.
