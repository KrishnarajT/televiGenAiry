1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,508
Mmm.

2
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:10,183
Necesito un bueno worker.

3
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:11,987
Tu es fuerte. Come on.

4
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:21,927
We don't go with that man.

5
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:24,597
I've seen several men go with
that man and none come back.

6
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:27,131
We've lost friends...

7
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:30,170
We don't know what
he does with them.

8
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:33,703
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

9
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,144
I pick up day laborers

10
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:38,117
and tell them that
they'll get paid at 6:00 p.m.

11
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:41,283
At 5:45, a certain
I.N.S. Agent,

12
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:43,152
by the name of Mose Schrute,

13
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:44,782
throws them in
the back of a van,

14
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,383
drops them off in
the middle of Harrisburg

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,553
and tells them it's Canada.

16
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:52,456
Tu es un bueno worker?

17
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:54,194
Si. Yo muy bueno worker.

18
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:56,803
Yel acento...
Donde are you from?

19
00:00:56,904 --> 00:00:58,201
Scranton.

20
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:01,103
Y... before that,
la Philadelphia.

21
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:02,640
You speak English?
Yes.

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,302
I'm really good at English.
Okay, good, me too.

23
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:05,936
Get in the car.
Okay.

24
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:09,946
Who is this guy
by our cars?

25
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:12,281
That is my new
maintenance worker, Nate,

26
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:14,116
and you'll be happy to know
that he's taking care of

27
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:16,383
that hornet's nest
that you've
been griping about.

28
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,324
Yeah. I got stung
up my dress.

29
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:19,586
Poor hornet.

30
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,491
I've left him all
the tools he needs.

31
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:22,927
This is do or die.

32
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,726
If he chooses correctly,
he'll conquer the hornets.

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,460
And if he doesn't?

34
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:28,724
He'll die.

35
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,369
What?
Beg your pardon?

36
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:32,497
DWIGHT: When did the phrase
"do or die"
become so corrupted?

37
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,470
KELLY: Is that
a blowtorch?
No.

38
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:37,375
No, no, no! No, no!

39
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,072
DWIGHT: Interesting choice.

40
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:40,408
PAM: Yes.

41
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:41,604
ANDY: Very, very smart.

42
00:01:41,682 --> 00:01:42,671
PAM: Walking away.

43
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:44,306
No! No, no, no!

44
00:01:44,385 --> 00:01:45,374
The bat.

45
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:46,610
PAM: What is he doing?

46
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:48,348
ANDY: Oh!
They're stinging him!

47
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:49,616
ALL: No, no, no!

48
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:50,918
No, no!

49
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:17,479
Good morning, Erin.
Any mustaches,
I mean messages?

50
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,677
Terrific.

51
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:21,714
MICHAEL:
There are many reasons

52
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,848
a man would wear
a fake mustache to work.

53
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,025
He is a fan

54
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:27,560
of the outrageous.

55
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:28,720
He loves to

56
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,058
surprise!

57
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:33,926
He loves other things
as well.

58
00:02:35,036 --> 00:02:36,025
Wow.

59
00:02:40,474 --> 00:02:41,463
Okay.

60
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,010
It's a pimple,
Phyllis.

61
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,478
Avril Lavigne gets
them all the time,

62
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:48,174
and she rocks
harder than anyone alive.

63
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:50,311
That's no pimple, Michael.

64
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:51,878
You mean cancer?

65
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:54,351
What? No way. No.
Definitely not.
Not cancer.

66
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:56,615
It's just good to catch
a Michael train
of thought early

67
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:59,022
before it derails
and destroys
the entire town.

68
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,949
MEREDITH: Wait, wait, wait.

69
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:02,154
It's just a cold sore.

70
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,253
It is?

71
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:05,128
Yup, just a cold sore.
Just a cold sore.

72
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,360
Thank you. Phyllis,
I don't have acne.

73
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:09,403
I have a cold sore.
I didn't even have a cold.

74
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:10,761
I don't know how I got it.

75
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:12,032
I know how you got it.

76
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:13,164
How?

77
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,434
Michael, come on.

78
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,540
A cold sore is herpes.

79
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,943
What?
What you should do,
Michael,

80
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:20,275
is have a doctor
take a look at it,

81
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:21,645
'cause we don't
really know what that is.

82
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:24,545
I know tons and tons
of people who have herpes.

83
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,016
I have it myself.

84
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:27,076
That's what it is.

85
00:03:27,154 --> 00:03:28,587
I've never seen
herpes on you.

86
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,283
'Cause it's on
my genitals, genius.

87
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:31,818
You have a penis?

88
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:34,357
Michael, have you ever
been tested for STDs?

89
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:36,520
Yeah, my last physical
when I was 40.

90
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:38,190
That was, like,
10 years ago.

91
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:39,493
No, it was, like,
four years ago.

92
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,227
Michael,
you're at least 46.

93
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:42,291
Why "at least"?

94
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,770
If you're guessing 46,
just say 46.

95
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:55,012
Can we please talk about
how gross Meredith is?

96
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:56,876
This is what you get

97
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,919
when you treat your
body like an outhouse.

98
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:01,111
ANDY: You know what, guys?

99
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:03,486
How about we just
chill out a little bit
on the herp chat?

100
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,620
Okay? I was
an R.A. In college,

101
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:06,785
and I can tell you,

102
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:08,556
the number one sexually
transmitted disease

103
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:11,831
is ignorance.

104
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:14,830
I guess maybe she
could marry a
meth dealer with crabs...

105
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:16,529
I don't even want
to know about these things.

106
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:17,764
Hey, guys.

107
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:26,707
How did this happen?
How did I get this?

108
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:28,976
Sometimes it can lie dormant
in a woman for years.

109
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:30,380
They may not even
know that they have it.

110
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:31,850
You know what?
I feel like

111
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,147
one of those
old-timey sailors with VD.

112
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,188
Eh, it's me own darn fault.

113
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:37,986
Girl in every port!
What port?

114
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,026
The Jan port?

115
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:42,322
The Holly port?
Don't even...

116
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,188
Holly was clean, okay?

117
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:46,130
If anything,
I gave it to her.

118
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,690
You may have.
Oh, my God.

119
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:48,792
What if I did?

120
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,894
You need to contact Holly.

121
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,963
You need to notify her that
she is crawling with herpes.

122
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:55,575
Okay. You know what?

123
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:56,667
Might.

124
00:04:56,744 --> 00:04:59,304
Might be crawling with herpes.

125
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:02,239
I might have
gotten it after her.

126
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:04,375
You need to contact
every woman you've been with

127
00:05:04,452 --> 00:05:06,477
and notify them of
your herpes infestation.

128
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,014
It's the right thing to do.

129
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:09,912
There's no way
I'm gonna do that.

130
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:11,181
Then I will.

131
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:12,350
All right, I...

132
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:16,025
Now, I'm no doctor,
but it seems to me

133
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:18,121
that we all have an obligation
to the public health

134
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,565
to track down anyone
who gives us a disease,

135
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:21,931
inform them of it,

136
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:24,197
and take overwhelming revenge
on that person.

137
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:26,469
Again, I'm no doctor.

138
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:28,667
I'm just a normal guy
who enjoys revenge.

139
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,338
DONNA: Hello.

140
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:34,378
Hi, Donna. It's Michael.

141
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:36,615
Michael. I didn't
think I'd hear from you.

142
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:37,941
How've you been?

143
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:39,451
I have a disease

144
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,747
for which there
is no known cure

145
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:44,347
that has been
sexually transmitted to me.

146
00:05:44,892 --> 00:05:46,086
Oh, no!

147
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:47,858
I can't even say it.

148
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:50,055
H-I

149
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,119
Oh, my God!

150
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:56,500
R-P-E-E-S.

151
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,404
Wait. You're calling to tell
me that you have herpes?

152
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:04,501
No. I am calling to see
if you gave me herpes,

153
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:06,273
because if you did,

154
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:08,542
I would be able to avoid
a lot of sucky conversations.

155
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:11,548
So you have it, right?
No.

156
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,216
Does your stupid
husband have it?

157
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:14,652
No, he doesn't.

158
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,383
Are you telling me
I have to get tested?

159
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:18,625
Yes, I'm telling you
you have to get
tested for herpes.

160
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,159
Good-bye!
So long, Donna.

161
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:23,258
Excuse me, everyone,
can I have your attention,
please?

162
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,354
Not again.

163
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:25,420
What do you mean "again"?

164
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:27,399
You're always
asking for our attention.

165
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:28,865
Well, maybe like a year ago.

166
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:30,130
Mmm. Seems recent.

167
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:31,501
No, that's...

168
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:33,665
Andy, the reason
it seems more recent

169
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,709
is because many of us here
have never stood up

170
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:37,243
and asked for
everyone's attention,

171
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,537
and it seems like
you've done it
on several occasions.

172
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:41,410
Everyone, I've noticed that

173
00:06:41,482 --> 00:06:44,280
we've not been entirely
kind to one of our own,

174
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:46,810
due to stigmas
and prejudices.

175
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:48,479
Oh! When you got
your new phone,

176
00:06:48,556 --> 00:06:50,046
that's when you asked
for everyone's attention.

177
00:06:50,124 --> 00:06:51,182
STANLEY: World Cup.
That's what I was thinking.

178
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,247
OSCAR: That's right.

179
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:54,157
You kept announcing scores.

180
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:56,454
It's the world's only
international sport, so...

181
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,265
This is Holly.

182
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,396
No, this is Holly.

183
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,738
No, this is Holly.

184
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:08,969
No, this is Holly.

185
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:11,110
No... This is Michael Scott.

186
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,040
Busted.

187
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,414
So, what can I
do for you, Holly?

188
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:19,349
I'm calling because

189
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:20,849
there was
a terrible car accident.

190
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:23,389
Oh, really?
Was anyone killed?

191
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:25,583
A lot of people.

192
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:26,956
Any nuns?

193
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:28,255
Three nuns.

194
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:31,094
Missionaries
from South Africa.

195
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:33,729
Were they in
the missionary position?

196
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:37,533
Hot pizza, check it and see

197
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:41,072
I got a whole
Bunch of pepperoni

198
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,268
Yeah.
Now you're looking at me.

199
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,203
Anyone who's interested
in entering into

200
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,941
an honest discussion
about the sexual
mores and taboos

201
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:51,542
of modern society
will be rewarded
with a pizza break.

202
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,983
Do you ever wonder
what life would
have been like

203
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:55,146
if you hadn't
been transferred?

204
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:57,451
HOLLY: Yeah.

205
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:58,684
We would have twins.

206
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,649
I don't think
we'd have kids.

207
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,127
Mmm-hmm.
We dated for a few weeks.

208
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:04,331
Mmm-mmm.
We would be married.

209
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:07,465
Michael, I've been
dating A.J. For a year
and a half now.

210
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,268
You do this, you know?

211
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,360
Do what?

212
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:12,671
You romanticize things.

213
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,438
I don't romantici...

214
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:16,498
No.

215
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:17,601
Michael, you cried

216
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:19,737
at that tag line for
a movie you made up.

217
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:21,643
"He had no arms or legs.

218
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:23,307
"He couldn't see,
hear or speak.

219
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,385
"This is how he led a nation."

220
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:28,584
You made us out to be
more than we were.

221
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:30,850
Maybe we were
more than we were.

222
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,282
I don't know what
you're getting
so upset about.

223
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,385
We had a fun fling
a long time ago.

224
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,526
It's a good memory.
Okay, all right.

225
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:39,498
I gotta go.
Michael...

226
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:45,170
He forgot
to mention the herpes.

227
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,470
It didn't come up
organically.

228
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,972
to accommodate
the suppliers.

229
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:53,442
Gentlemen, nice to see you.
It'll be just a moment.

230
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,309
If you could show them
into conference room B.

231
00:08:55,382 --> 00:08:56,371
The pharmaceutical company

232
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,974
should be able
to accommodate us.

233
00:08:58,085 --> 00:09:00,280
How do I do it?
Raise my daughter,

234
00:09:00,354 --> 00:09:02,219
work as director of office
purchasing for this hospital

235
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,189
and release an album
of Doris Day covers

236
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:05,850
on my own label?

237
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:08,559
If I knew,
I'd tell you.

238
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:09,687
It's nice to see you
doing so well.

239
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:10,987
Yeah, I'm really happy.

240
00:09:11,098 --> 00:09:14,033
Me and Astrid
against the world.
We're loving it.

241
00:09:14,268 --> 00:09:16,236
Yeah, so,
kind of the supermom.

242
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,793
Bringing home the bacon.
Yeah.

243
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,338
Fry it up in a pan

244
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:20,771
Never, never, never let you

245
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:21,865
Forget you're a man

246
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,533
Love that commercial.

247
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,511
I don't understand
the reference.

248
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:28,708
Well,

249
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,406
Michael, it was nice
to get your call.

250
00:09:30,484 --> 00:09:32,543
We had to come over
right away. It's urgent.
Okay.

251
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:33,950
Michael has something
to tell you.
Shh.

252
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,488
Are you gonna
keep me in suspense?

253
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:44,588
Would you excuse us?

254
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:45,654
Okay, I'm gonna

255
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,622
head outta here.

256
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:50,067
I know you have a lot
to talk about, okay?

257
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:52,664
Is there an operating theater

258
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,037
that's open to visitors?

259
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:55,473
Never mind. I'll find it.

260
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,074
He hasn't changed.
No.

261
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:01,715
So, what couldn't wait?

262
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:04,878
Am I the kind of person

263
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,886
to misremember
our relationship

264
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,751
as something more
than it was?

265
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:09,811
Michael Scott,

266
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,120
you are here
for a post-mortem.

267
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,448
What?

268
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:15,761
You wanna dig into
our relationship,

269
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,628
go over it,
see what killed it.

270
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,192
Okay.

271
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:23,663
I'm in.

272
00:10:24,371 --> 00:10:25,929
So, guys,
I've been really bothered

273
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:29,032
by the way certain people
are getting treated
around here.

274
00:10:29,109 --> 00:10:32,078
And I just think
as an office,
we're better than that.

275
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:34,746
Okay, now, I'm gonna
show you a picture

276
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:36,640
of genitalia.

277
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:38,807
ANGELA: Andy.

278
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,417
What, 'cause he's black?
Nope.

279
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:42,750
It's 'cause it's genitalia.

280
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:45,485
Perfectly normal genitalia,
Tuna.

281
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:49,223
Now I'm gonna show you
another picture

282
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:51,491
of perfectly normal
genitalia.

283
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:52,930
Oh, my God!

284
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,460
Am I blocking anybody?
Can everybody see?

285
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:57,163
ANDY: Perfectly normal.
Big deal.

286
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:59,339
Yeah, sure,
it's got some herpes on it.

287
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:03,207
But you know what?
It's just as normal
as anyone else's.

288
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:07,007
No. In the beginning,
we were not good.

289
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,146
Well, there was a bit
of a learning curve

290
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,012
in the conversation
department,

291
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:12,745
but between the sheets,

292
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,287
we were like
Jordan and Pippen.

293
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:15,647
Well, if there was anything
exciting about it,

294
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:17,587
it was because
we both knew
it was wrong.

295
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:18,983
Because we worked together.

296
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:20,083
No.

297
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,025
Okay, imagine
there's a princess

298
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,919
who falls for a guy
beneath her station,

299
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:25,464
and the queen
doesn't like this at all.

300
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,295
And the princess knows
that the queen
doesn't like it,

301
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,800
and so it makes her
want to do it all the more

302
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:29,858
just to get at the queen.

303
00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:32,799
Am I the princess?
No, I'm the princess.

304
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:34,363
And the queen.

305
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:36,271
Okay.
So I'm the guy
at the station.

306
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,201
ASTRID: Mommy!

307
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,208
Assie! Oh!

308
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:44,307
How was school?

309
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,373
It was cool

310
00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,977
What did you learn?

311
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,352
What did I learn?

312
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:51,914
You might have learned

313
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:54,552
Shapes, or blocks

314
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:56,994
Or clocks, or colors

315
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,895
Or you might have learned

316
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:02,094
That we're all
sisters and brothers...

317
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:03,466
I have herpes.

318
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:04,799
What? You...

319
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:07,503
I used to think
that she was "the one."

320
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:10,401
Or at least a "the one."

321
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:13,440
And if I called
that one so wrong...

322
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,778
Herpes, like all STDs,
is a consequence of sex.

323
00:12:19,853 --> 00:12:21,787
Can anyone else name
any other consequences?

324
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:24,354
It feels unbelievable.

325
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:26,821
Okay, I guess we can
make a pros column.

326
00:12:28,028 --> 00:12:29,017
"Feels..."

327
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:30,461
KEVIN: "Unbelievable."

328
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,588
Okay.

329
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:34,156
The ability to
express love physically.

330
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:36,799
It's a magical thing.

331
00:12:37,337 --> 00:12:38,702
ANDY: "Express love."
"Magical."

332
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:41,606
It feels amazing.

333
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,469
Um... Okay, is that different
from "feels unbelievable"?

334
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,278
Yes.

335
00:12:46,346 --> 00:12:47,745
Then I will write it down.

336
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:50,542
The feeling of pure risk.

337
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:52,778
Creed, I had that
in the cons column,

338
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:54,984
but...
It's thrilling.

339
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:58,382
Okay. Then...

340
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:00,521
We'll move that.

341
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:02,255
"Thrill of risk."

342
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,229
Andy, aren't there also
negatives to sex?

343
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:06,155
Yes! Thank you.

344
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:07,590
Such as...

345
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:08,657
Unplanned pregnancy.

346
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,430
Yes. Unplanned pregnancy.

347
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:11,595
Like Jim and Pam, what?

348
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:12,661
Hey.

349
00:13:12,773 --> 00:13:14,934
Just admit
that your baby
was a mistake.

350
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:17,476
Whoa!
Hey, our baby
was not a mistake.

351
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:20,506
She was a surprise.
Good.

352
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,808
I'm sure
they don't regret
having that child.

353
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:23,872
Let's move it to the pros.

354
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:24,940
BOTH: Thank you.

355
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:28,647
Okay. "Unplanned pregnancy,"
going in the pros column.

356
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,653
Next up is Helene.

357
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,483
You're gonna want to
make a left on Willow,

358
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:36,459
which is a little ways away.

359
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,519
I'll remind you.

360
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,531
You know, I don't know
if I trust Jan's judgment.

361
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41,533
She...
Jan knows paper.

362
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,466
No, not paper.
Relationships.

363
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:45,528
To have the ability
to point out

364
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,267
if a man is making
a bigger deal
out of something

365
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:50,071
than is really there.
Wait, what Holly said?

366
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:52,042
Yes! I don't...
Forget it, Michael.

367
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,437
Today is about herpes.

368
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:54,502
I know.

369
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:56,741
Okay? Who gave it
to you, who has it...

370
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,011
Right.
And who is going to pay.

371
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:59,074
Okay.

372
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:00,141
To answer your
question about Jan...

373
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,653
No, Jan is insane.

374
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:02,848
Why do you think I...

375
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:04,082
Left! Willow, now!

376
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:05,215
All right! God!

377
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,527
Hi, stranger.

378
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:10,320
Long time.

379
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:11,386
Who are you?

380
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:13,824
I'm Michael.
We dated for a while.

381
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:15,262
I don't think so.

382
00:14:15,702 --> 00:14:16,930
Michael?

383
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:20,372
Oh, hey!

384
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:24,204
Dwight, would you take
my grandmother for a walk

385
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:25,608
while I talk to
the real Helene?

386
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,703
Come on, old lady,
let's go.

387
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,769
What is happening?

388
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:29,372
Come on.

389
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:32,746
Who can tell me
the safest form
of safe sex?

390
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:34,581
Condoms.
Incorrect.

391
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,848
The only true form
of safe sex...

392
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:39,586
Okay? Abstinence.

393
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,853
Oh! I didn't
realize we were doing

394
00:14:42,162 --> 00:14:43,527
trick questions.

395
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,527
What's the safest
way to go skiing?

396
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,330
Don't ski.

397
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:48,595
DARRYL: Huh?

398
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,327
I just thought
I'd bring it up

399
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:52,372
in case someone here
was practicing abstinence.

400
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:54,298
That's all. Anybody?

401
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:56,534
Andy, that's way too
personal of a question.

402
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,339
Well, someone
could answer it
if they wanted to.

403
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,307
Okay, in that case,

404
00:15:03,383 --> 00:15:06,648
I will now show you how
to put this condom on using...

405
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:10,883
this pencil.
Oh, God!

406
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,449
What?

407
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:14,016
Why would you
choose a pencil, Andy?

408
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:15,851
Well, I'm not gonna
use my penis, Oscar.

409
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,692
It's not exactly
hard right now, anyway.

410
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,891
Come on, give it
a rest, pencil.

411
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,593
I'm doing this
for you, Meredith!

412
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:23,531
I didn't want it!
Well, didn't you?

413
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:25,036
Why didn't...

414
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:27,972
Does no one appreciate
what I'm doing right now?

415
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:30,271
MEREDITH: Whoa!

416
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:34,376
It'll go away in time.
Just don't touch it.

417
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:36,942
Did I make more
of what we had

418
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,109
than was really there?

419
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:39,544
What did you think we were?

420
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:42,812
Just a quirky indie movie,

421
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,356
weird sort of thing,

422
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:47,759
breaking all the rules,
but had to end

423
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:50,319
because the summer
was over for you.

424
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:53,228
I think that for you
to have come here

425
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,291
even expecting

426
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,799
that we could have
a conversation like this

427
00:15:57,871 --> 00:16:00,806
shows how
self-deluded you are.

428
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:05,439
Michael, your memory
has failed you greatly.

429
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,672
Jerk.

430
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:21,919
Michael.

431
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,625
So, this is a chef's kitchen,

432
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:28,133
which makes it perfect
for real entertainers.

433
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,460
Real entertainer,
like Billy Joel.

434
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:33,634
Michael.
Carole. How are you?

435
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,035
I'm great. How are you?

436
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:37,804
I'm great.
I saw your sign outside,

437
00:16:37,944 --> 00:16:39,673
and I decided
I'm gonna pull in,

438
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,576
and maybe I'm going to
buy a house from her.

439
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,248
You didn't call my office

440
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:45,147
and ask them
where I was?
No!

441
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:46,412
That's so...

442
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:48,554
'Cause the receptionist
told me that a man called,

443
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:50,783
but he would only say
that he was my ex-Iover.

444
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:51,915
Weird.
Yeah.

445
00:16:51,992 --> 00:16:53,016
Sounds like a nice guy.

446
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:56,753
I don't know,
I mean, people were being
really mean to Meredith and...

447
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,995
But this wasn't really
about Meredith, was it?

448
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,057
You and Erin
were broken up.

449
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:03,395
How is that
relevant to anything?

450
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,200
I asked you
if it was okay
if I asked her out.

451
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,130
You said, and I quote,

452
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:11,235
"My good sir,
nothing would make me happier

453
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:14,212
"than to hand you the hand
of the hand once in my hand."

454
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:17,378
I specifically remembered it
because you said it
in such a weird way.

455
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:18,908
Well, the only
reason I said that

456
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:20,850
is 'cause you
asked me so politely,

457
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:23,285
and it was very
difficult for me
to say no.

458
00:17:24,357 --> 00:17:25,551
I'll let this slide,

459
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,920
but I expect you
to put this whole
Erin thing behind you.

460
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:31,930
Oh, wow!
Another living room.

461
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:33,154
It's a family room.

462
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,563
You put the TV there.
You put your family here.

463
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:39,562
Michael,
why are you here?

464
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,605
Somebody told me

465
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:44,610
that I romanticize
relationships.

466
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:47,503
You know,
we all do that.

467
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:49,671
I have herpes.

468
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,342
What?

469
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:53,543
Did you have that
while we were together?

470
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,712
I just found out today.

471
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:57,086
It's right there.

472
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,458
Oh! Oh! What, that's what
you're talking about?

473
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,220
Mmm-hmm. I'm sorry.

474
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:02,691
Did you have a doctor
check it out?

475
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,662
I'm between specialists
right now.

476
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,624
Yes. Yes, Michael.

477
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:10,897
Actually, you do make
a bigger deal out of things

478
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,370
than you need to.

479
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:14,667
You proposed to me
on our fourth date.

480
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:16,499
Well, I believe in
love at first sight.

481
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,238
Well, so do I,

482
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,506
but we didn't love
each other at first,
either.

483
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:23,008
I don't know what
you were thinking.

484
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,109
I know what I was
thinking at the time,

485
00:18:26,186 --> 00:18:28,177
but right now,
it just seems ridiculous.

486
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,886
DWIGHT: Excuse me.

487
00:18:31,191 --> 00:18:33,022
Someone died in the upstairs
bathroom, didn't they?

488
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,284
No.

489
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,291
We should
schedule meetings,

490
00:18:39,366 --> 00:18:41,300
'cause the days can
slip away with chitchat.

491
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,130
Are you crying?

492
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,161
No, I'm just sweating.

493
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,968
I don't know
what's got you upset,

494
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,703
but my advice
is stop crying.

495
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:52,301
I'm not crying.
I'm sweating.

496
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,375
Look, you need
to pick yourself up.

497
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,375
Man up, all right?

498
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,915
Son, you will win this
in the end.

499
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,553
It's all about heart

500
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:03,645
and character.

501
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:06,021
Be your best self.

502
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:08,117
Okay.

503
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:09,320
Yeah.

504
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:10,986
I have no idea
what his problem is.

505
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:12,758
It's just my standard advice.

506
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:14,060
It's good advice, right?

507
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,729
This is Holly Flax.

508
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:16,996
I can't come to
the phone right now,

509
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,298
but please leave a message

510
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:20,362
at the sound of
the tiny truck backing up.

511
00:19:22,142 --> 00:19:23,769
Hi, Holly, it's Michael.

512
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,606
I just wanted to
call and let you know

513
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,443
that I was thinking
about what you said.

514
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:31,082
It's just, you know,

515
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:34,920
it's weird. Today, I

516
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:38,117
ended up seeing a lot of
the women that I used to date,

517
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,355
and in my mind,
they were all great.

518
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:44,196
And then when I
actually saw them,

519
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:47,024
it was mostly a freak show.

520
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,358
And you and me,

521
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:50,903
that must have been
a real train wreck.

522
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:54,129
You know what?

523
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:57,438
Holly, you're wrong.

524
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:00,472
You are wrong.

525
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,911
I remember
every second of us.

526
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,042
And talking to you today,

527
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:10,715
I don't feel for them
anything like what
I feel for you.

528
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,652
It's...

529
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,223
I didn't joke
with any of them.

530
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:16,922
I joked with you.

531
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:19,130
You were the only one

532
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:21,667
who was actually happy
to hear from me.

533
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:24,468
And I don't know why
you downgraded what we had,

534
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:26,630
but I did not make us up.

535
00:20:28,274 --> 00:20:29,366
Okay.

536
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,569
Oh, and you might,
you should talk to a doctor

537
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,738
because you might have herpes.

538
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:35,870
Bye.

539
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:43,885
What is this about?
Oscar,

540
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:46,557
We once sucked face in public

541
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,524
as part of
an office presentation

542
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:53,054
to destroy the stigma
about gay kissing.

543
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,197
Do you recall?
Yes, and...

544
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:57,395
You may have given me
a sexually
transmitted disease.

545
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:58,893
What?

546
00:20:58,972 --> 00:20:59,961
Herpes duplex.

547
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,900
It's probably just
an ingrown mustache hair,
but we have to be exhaustive.

548
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:06,006
I've already
contacted all of my
ex-Iovers except for you.

549
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,974
We were never lovers.

550
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,345
I'm gonna need
a list of every man
you've ever had sex with.

551
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,143
I'm talking train stations,
men's rooms...

552
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:16,188
Flower shops,
fireworks celebrations...

553
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:17,515
Fence with a hole in it.

554
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,614
Moonlit gondola.

555
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,215
Carriage ride
through Central Park.

556
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:21,783
The woods behind
the liquor store.

557
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:23,260
The swamp behind
the old folks' home.

558
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:24,887
MICHAEL:
Electric car dealership.

559
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:26,454
DWIGHT:
The Democratic Primary.

560
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,660
Oscar, think about... Think.
