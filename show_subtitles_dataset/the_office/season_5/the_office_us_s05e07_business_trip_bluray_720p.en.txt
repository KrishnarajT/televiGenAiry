1
00:00:02,242 --> 00:00:03,993
Did you know that in Morocco

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:05,745
it is common to
exchange a small gift

3
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:08,039
when meeting somebody
for the first time?

4
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:12,377
In Japan, you must always commit
suicide to avoid embarrassment.

5
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:18,591
In Italy, you must always wash your
hands after going to the bathroom.

6
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:20,802
This is considered
to be polite.

7
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:22,053
Why are you telling us this?

8
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:26,474
I am jetting off on an
international business trip.

9
00:00:26,934 --> 00:00:28,101
Where are you going?

10
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:29,435
To Canada.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Where is it?

12
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:31,604
Canada.
Okay.

13
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:33,856
My boss is
sending me abroad

14
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:36,651
to do a presentation to
an international client,

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,780
and I have always been intrigued
by all things international,

16
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:44,951
the women, the pancakes,
the man of mystery.

17
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:48,913
Meredith, I would like you to pretend
that you are from Abu Dhabi.

18
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:49,997
Hello.

19
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:52,375
I am ashamed
at your naked face.

20
00:00:53,043 --> 00:00:55,336
I must cover it
with my jacket.

21
00:00:58,382 --> 00:01:00,800
You are now sexy
in your culture.

22
00:01:34,752 --> 00:01:35,918
T-minus...

23
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:37,336
6.5 days.

24
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:47,972
One more week.

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,062
Pam comes back from
New York next week,

26
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:57,774
and everyone here has just
been so excited for me

27
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:01,360
and involved
and intrusive and weird.

28
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,867
One more week.

29
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,246
Do you have your passport?

30
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,331
I have my passport.

31
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:14,457
Got your per diem?

32
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,125
I have my per diem.

33
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,170
I already know what I am
going to spend this on.

34
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:21,714
I'm going to buy a sweater.

35
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:23,382
Michael,
that's for your food.

36
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,843
Well, I'll just... I'll use
different money for that.

37
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:27,595
I was happy to send
Michael on this trip.

38
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:30,473
He's been feeling pretty down
since we had to transfer Holly

39
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:32,725
up to New Hampshire, and...

40
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,270
But this little perk really
seemed to turn him around,

41
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:38,815
and it's pretty tough
to find somebody

42
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:41,734
who wants to go up
to Winnipeg mid-November.

43
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:47,365
And business-class air, like a
five-star hotel in the sky.

44
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,576
Nothing but the best. Actually
better than a five-star hotel

45
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:52,578
'cause you get a big,
cushy seat

46
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:54,580
and you sit in
a row of people

47
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,875
and to eat whatever
the mind can imagine.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,421
I think I am going to have
a fillet with mushroom sauce.

49
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,841
Well, I'm just glad
you're happy

50
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:06,008
because, you know,
I felt bad.

51
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,010
Well, that is all in the past.

52
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:12,390
And in terms of nightlife, when you
get there, just ask the concierge.

53
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,184
They have one of those?

54
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:17,061
Let's do this!

55
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:18,396
Wait, why do you
need three suitcases?

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,356
Two are empty.
For souvenirs.

57
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
You have your money belt?

58
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:22,525
I do.
It is right here.

59
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:23,609
Oh, no, no, no, no.

60
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:26,237
You wanna wear that puppy right
up on the breastbone like a bra.

61
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,322
No, I don't wanna wear a bra.
Here, let me help you.

62
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:29,448
Stop it! Stop it!

63
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:31,409
Do you want to get robbed
in a foreign country?

64
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:32,535
I wash my hands of this.

65
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:34,036
Okay, where's
my translator?

66
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,705
- Ici, monsieur.
- There he is.

67
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:40,209
I'm just bidding a bon voyage
à la mon petite fiancée.

68
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:44,171
Translation,
goodbye my petite fiancée.

69
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,883
Be good.
I will try.

70
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,009
Meaning what?

71
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,803
Meaning I will try to
get other dudes laid.

72
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,597
Yeah, baby. That's what
I'm talking about.

73
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,724
That could be you if you
hadn't forgotten French.

74
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,601
Where is my numbers man?

75
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:57,727
Here.

76
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:00,062
There we go!
Our town car awaits.

77
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:01,147
It's just a van.

78
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:02,398
It's not just a van.

79
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:04,150
Look, I know
my way around a van.

80
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:05,860
That is just a van.

81
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,529
Dwight, can you
get those, please?

82
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:15,244
Welcome to Cribs, the
business-class edition.

83
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:16,996
Check this out. Mimosa.

84
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:19,790
Sweet. Handed it to
me as I sat down.

85
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,752
This was my hot towel.
It is still wet.

86
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,087
Michael G. Scott
rolling like a pimp.

87
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:26,923
Take a sip of that.
Mmm-hmm.

88
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,174
Is that good?

89
00:04:28,216 --> 00:04:30,760
Mmm! Don't drink all of it.
Give some to Oscar.

90
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:31,886
That's really good.
I'm good.

91
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,554
You want one of your own?
I can hook you up.

92
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,764
I'm sorry, you'll
need to keep moving.

93
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:39,936
Yes, this is Beth. This is my
personal valet/flight attendant,

94
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:41,729
and she will be
helping me this morning.

95
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:43,189
We need to keep
the aisle clear.

96
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:45,900
Yes. Get back. Get back.
Oh. All right.

97
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:48,110
Come on. Get back to the slums.
Here we go.

98
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:49,320
Oh, boy.

99
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:51,906
You guys, check it out.

100
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,159
My own personal DVD
player and 20 movies.

101
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:56,702
Andy brought one, too.

102
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:57,787
Harry and the Hendersons.

103
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,539
Keep it down.

104
00:05:00,707 --> 00:05:03,084
I made egg-salad sandwiches.
Do you want one?

105
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:06,253
Could you have picked something
stinkier to bring on a plane?

106
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:08,798
My God, Oscar, really.

107
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:11,676
Do you have a bag of baby poop in
there, too, to share with everybody?

108
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,469
No, I'll be ordering
my own food.

109
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,137
Thank you very much. Hi.

110
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,222
Hi.

111
00:05:16,306 --> 00:05:17,682
I'd like to see a menu,
please.

112
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:21,185
Oh, I'm sorry, there are no meals
on flights less than two hours.

113
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:22,395
Okay.

114
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,944
Doesn't matter because I'm
going to take a nap.

115
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:35,282
I think I'm going to use
my complimentary blindfold.

116
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:40,579
I will don it and... Oh.

117
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,415
Look at that,

118
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,917
I can't see
because I am in...

119
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,502
God!

120
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,422
And what would
you like to drink?

121
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:53,759
Just checking out where
I'm gonna be pretty soon

122
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,594
when Pam gets back.

123
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:57,930
It's gonna be
close quarters.

124
00:05:58,015 --> 00:05:59,932
Gonna be a lot of tension.

125
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,560
For you. I'm with Darryl.

126
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:07,440
This looks like where I'll
probably do my pushups every day.

127
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:14,113
Is that supposed
to impress me?

128
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:21,704
No, not gonna happen.

129
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:24,040
He has hurt me
too much and too often,

130
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,125
and I am in
a healthy relationship now,

131
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:28,878
so I'm not going to flaunt it,
I'm not going to hurt him,

132
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:30,963
but that door is closed.

133
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:34,216
What are we doing?
This is so wrong!

134
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:35,634
Yeah.

135
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:39,764
This is nice.
This is nice.

136
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,768
Move in here.
Very sweet.

137
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:48,731
- I'll check us in.
- All right.

138
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:50,399
Very cool.
Very cool.

139
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:52,443
We are going to find out where
the action is, my friend.

140
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,236
Okay.
Where's the concierge?

141
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,822
Yes, Wallace said there
would be one of those.

142
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:58,115
Bingo.

143
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,203
Follow moi, bro-sieur.

144
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:03,704
Wow.

145
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,414
What about
a nice sushi place?

146
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,041
Maybe a place
with a view?

147
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:11,087
Oh. Matsuki.
It's a good one.

148
00:07:12,255 --> 00:07:13,756
You may walk there
if you wish,

149
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,927
or you may take the
number 17 bus until 9:00.

150
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:21,097
Other than that,
you can take the taxi,

151
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:22,765
and the number
is right there.

152
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:25,768
Wow. Wow, I'm blown
away by this.

153
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:27,812
I...

154
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,689
This is great.
Thank you.

155
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:32,900
One final question.

156
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:36,695
Where might you find yourself on
a Winnipeg night like tonight?

157
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,323
Oh. The Huntsman is good.

158
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:40,407
The Huntsman?

159
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,701
Down here,
the financial district.

160
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:46,956
A concierge is the Winnipeg
equivalent of a geisha.

161
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,500
This is a woman
who has been

162
00:07:49,584 --> 00:07:51,961
trained in the fine art
of fanciness and pleasure,

163
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:55,631
and when you meet one,
it is intoxicating.

164
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:58,384
Just what
the doctor ordered.

165
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,929
I can't believe this.

166
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,184
Are you sure?

167
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,687
I just talked
to my advisor. Failing.

168
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,148
Wow. I thought you
were good at Flash.

169
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,193
I was. And then they switched to
Acrobat just as I was learning Quark.

170
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:17,903
I hate computers.

171
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:20,030
Okay, okay,
it's no big deal.

172
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:21,407
So you're not
a computer geek.

173
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,701
I have to stay and retake it.

174
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:27,997
Wow. Um...

175
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:31,250
Well, okay.

176
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:33,919
That means
another 12 weeks.

177
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,006
Can you do another
three months of this?

178
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,466
It's not...
It's not about me.

179
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,510
I mean, this is your dream.

180
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:45,556
And you went to
New York to do this.

181
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:51,020
So when you come back, you come
back the right way, right?

182
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:54,315
Right.

183
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:57,276
You okay?

184
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,447
My cell battery's low,
so I have to let you go.

185
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,741
Okay. All right.
All right.

186
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:04,825
Love you. Bye.

187
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,076
Love you, too.

188
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,470
Guys. She's in there.

189
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:26,597
Engaging wings.

190
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:30,226
I'm probably going to leave
after one drink. Let's do this.

191
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,645
Yeah, with a hot slab of
Canadian bacon in your hand.

192
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:37,316
Excuse me. Hello. Concierge Marie.
Michael Scott.

193
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:38,901
Good to see you again.

194
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:40,694
Hello. Good to see you.

195
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,825
This is my associate from
Dunder Mifflin, Oscar Martinez.

196
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,952
Nice to meet you.
Oscar.

197
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:49,411
Works in accounting.

198
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:55,042
This is Concierge Marie,
who works at our hotel.

199
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:58,879
You look, how you
say, radiant tonight.

200
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,007
Thank you.

201
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:05,386
And it is, how you say,
a beautiful night.

202
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:06,845
Michael, why?

203
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,764
She's foreign. I...

204
00:10:08,848 --> 00:10:12,476
For madame et monsieur.

205
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,936
Thank you.

206
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,187
You're very welcome.

207
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:16,272
Thank you, Andy.

208
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:17,398
Thank you.

209
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,024
Let me get
a picture of you guys.

210
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:21,151
Everybody's going to
end up dying some day,

211
00:10:21,236 --> 00:10:23,445
and I think
it's better to die

212
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,698
with some people
that you like,

213
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:29,285
like Oscar and Andy
and Concierge Marie,

214
00:10:29,536 --> 00:10:32,037
than to know that there's
somebody out there

215
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:34,373
that you love
that you're not with.

216
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:39,295
All right, I've
scoped out the joint.

217
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,172
Those two dudes
are as good as naked.

218
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:48,220
How do you even
know they're gay?

219
00:10:48,763 --> 00:10:52,057
Come on, it's Dandy Dale
and Foppy McGee over there.

220
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:58,814
Mademoiselle, beer me deux Long
Island Iced Teas, s'il vous plaît.

221
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,066
Bad decision in a glass.

222
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:04,028
I don't care if you're
gay, straight, engaged,

223
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:06,989
whatever,
a guy needs intercourse.

224
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,283
You will thank me
when they spank thee.

225
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,285
Don't do this.

226
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:13,662
You guys like apples?

227
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:14,747
What?

228
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:16,081
Do you like apples?

229
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,333
Sorry, what?

230
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,626
How do you like
these apples?

231
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,589
All right,
on a scale of one to 10,

232
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:26,675
how hot is that dude?

233
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:30,554
Is he your boyfriend
or something?

234
00:11:30,805 --> 00:11:35,267
No, but he could be yours
if you play your cards right.

235
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,395
Dude, leave us alone,
all right?

236
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:41,899
Gentlemen.

237
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,446
What are you doing?
Dude, you struck out.

238
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,324
They're totally stuck up.
Here. Drink up.

239
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,786
How about this one. It's
Christmas Eve... Mmm-hmm.

240
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:57,790
and everything is closed and you
need to get some dry-cleaning done.

241
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,708
12:00, midnight,
where do you go?

242
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:01,168
What do you do?

243
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:03,587
What do you do?
Come on, what do you do?

244
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,799
Uh... Astro Cleaners
on St. James Place

245
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:08,509
is the only place that
is open on that day.

246
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,636
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

247
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,221
If you don't
mind me asking...

248
00:12:12,305 --> 00:12:14,848
Anything.
You can ask me anything.

249
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:16,725
Okay.
I'm your wingman.

250
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,352
It's just that I've
sat next to Angela

251
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,354
for a very long,
very long time.

252
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:21,397
Right-oh.

253
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:24,691
How could anyone
stand that woman?

254
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:27,027
What?
What do you see in her?

255
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,904
What do you see in Angela?
What do I see in Angela?

256
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:30,531
I wanna know.

257
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:35,536
I see through a hard exterior to
a little jelly in the middle.

258
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:39,540
She is teaching me
to be a better person.

259
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:43,001
She's working
really hard on that.

260
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:45,170
And she has the softest
skin I've ever seen,

261
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:48,132
and I can't wait to
have sex with her.

262
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:49,675
You haven't had sex?

263
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,759
No.

264
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:53,178
Are you guys waiting
to get married? Or...

265
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:56,306
Honestly, I don't know
what we're waiting for.

266
00:12:56,391 --> 00:12:57,641
Andy, something is
wrong with that woman.

267
00:12:57,725 --> 00:12:58,934
What is wrong with her?

268
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:00,644
I'd like to know. You should
call her and ask her.

269
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:01,895
I'd like to know
what's wrong with her.

270
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,565
I should call her and ask her.
What is wrong with her?

271
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,192
Do it. It's a...
Call her.

272
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,946
Oh, my God, don't call her.
Don't call her, Andy.

273
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,448
Andy! Oh, my God!
It's too late.

274
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:14,199
It's too late.
It's dialing.

275
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:15,993
Now it's ringing.

276
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:19,329
Hello? Hello?

277
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:20,622
What is wrong with you?

278
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:22,374
Why won't you do Andy?

279
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:23,625
What?
That's Oscar,

280
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,043
and he wants to know
why you won't do me,

281
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:26,462
and I think it's
a valid question.

282
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:27,796
Are you drunk?

283
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,089
This is Andy Bernard!

284
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:30,632
I know who this is.

285
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:32,301
I want to take
you to sex school.

286
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:33,385
What?

287
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,470
Who is that, monkey?

288
00:13:34,554 --> 00:13:36,013
Is somebody there?

289
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:37,347
Are you drunk?

290
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,016
I have needs.

291
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,476
We'll discuss this later.

292
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,060
Naked!
What?

293
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:44,188
We'll discuss it later naked.

294
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:46,023
I wanna see you naked.

295
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,108
Do you want to get some
breakfast or something?

296
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:49,943
I'm so tired.
Okay.

297
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,227
How does
everyone know already?

298
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:24,561
Know what?

299
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:26,688
Pam failed art school.

300
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,857
Wow. Doesn't surprise me.

301
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:30,901
Excuse me?

302
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:32,611
Have you seen
her painting, Jim?

303
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:36,073
The building? There are shadows
coming from two different directions.

304
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,157
Dwight, stop it.

305
00:14:37,242 --> 00:14:38,909
What? Are there two suns?

306
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,786
- My God.
- Come on.

307
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:45,040
Last I checked, that's not an office
building in the Andromeda Galaxy.

308
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:48,126
All right. I'm gonna
grab a cup of coffee.

309
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,087
It's totally unrealistic.

310
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:52,130
There are no lines
in the parking lot.

311
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:55,342
Oscar!
Hey.

312
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,052
That was fun last night.

313
00:14:57,136 --> 00:14:58,178
Yeah, it was.

314
00:14:58,263 --> 00:14:59,930
You know,
it's true what they say.

315
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:02,558
Long Island Iced Teas
are way stronger in Canada.

316
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:05,310
Hey, thanks for
trying to hook me up.

317
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:09,314
Are you kidding me?
That's what I do.

318
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,316
Get the whole nine nards.

319
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,488
I can't believe
we called her up.

320
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:20,576
Totally.

321
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,412
It's crazy.
Wait.

322
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:24,705
Who?

323
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:26,164
I'm talking about Angela.

324
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,584
I can't believe we called
her up last night.

325
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:30,168
We called Angela?

326
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:32,337
You... You called her.

327
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:33,839
That was real?

328
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:37,509
I thought I dreamed that.

329
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:40,137
Oh, God. Oh, God!
All right.

330
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,055
Okay.
This is so bad.

331
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,098
Good morning, Michael.

332
00:15:43,182 --> 00:15:44,308
Are you ready
for the meeting?

333
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:45,601
Slept like a baby.

334
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,479
This can't happen again.

335
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:50,772
This has to happen again.

336
00:15:50,857 --> 00:15:53,483
Darryl can't happen again.
Look at me.

337
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:55,944
Do you want me to do more pushups?
Yeah.

338
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:58,697
Okay. You have to
break up with Darryl.

339
00:15:58,865 --> 00:16:01,617
I already typed out
a text message for you.

340
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,827
All you have to do
is press send.

341
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:07,331
I don't know. I mean, it's
well-written and all, I just...

342
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:10,250
Has to be done. We'll
press send together.

343
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,212
Oh, my God,
he's gonna kill us.

344
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:16,632
I'd like to see him try.

345
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:21,386
Oh.

346
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:25,307
He says it's cool.
He said it's cool!

347
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,433
That's all he wrote?

348
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:27,476
That's all he wrote.

349
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,353
Can I see it?
Mmm-hmm.

350
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:32,856
Didn't you two date for,
like, a long time?

351
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,567
Mmm-hmm.
This is like a fairytale.

352
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:50,290
I'll be honest with you. We've
been talking with Catalyst Paper.

353
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,167
Their prices are
better than yours.

354
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:55,170
Look, people continue to come
back to us time and time again

355
00:16:55,254 --> 00:16:57,631
because they feel
cared for here.

356
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:02,761
They feel respected, and they
feel that their needs matter.

357
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:07,099
They are treated
like human beings.

358
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,481
Everything okay?
Yes.

359
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:18,694
Oh, man,
she is so pissed.

360
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:20,946
She's taking us
back to first base.

361
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:23,782
What's first base
with Angela?

362
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,618
I get to kiss
her forehead.

363
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:32,499
I had a good time
hanging out this weekend.

364
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,459
I had a good time, too.

365
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:38,130
Wingman for life. W-M-F-L.

366
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:39,464
Thank you.

367
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:41,550
You up for a chest bump?

368
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:42,676
No.

369
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,095
Bro hug?

370
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:52,686
Back to basics. I like it.

371
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:55,021
I had to go
all the way to Canada

372
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:58,358
to get to know a guy who
sits 20 feet away from me.

373
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:00,736
And he's delightful.

374
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:04,698
Hey, I just heard
you guys made the sale.

375
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:06,366
Yeah, we locked
him up for two years.

376
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:07,743
Good. Very good!

377
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:10,954
See? I told you. Sounds like
somebody had a good trip.

378
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,957
No, actually,
the trip sucked.

379
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,083
Excuse me?

380
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:17,753
The trip sucked, David.

381
00:18:17,837 --> 00:18:19,129
It blew chunks.

382
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:21,757
It was terrible.
It was a bad trip.

383
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,884
I did not like the trip.
What are you talking about?

384
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:26,762
Well, starting with
the airport shuttle,

385
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,765
which was
basically just a van,

386
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:31,308
and business class...
Okay.

387
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:33,852
which was
basically just coach,

388
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,438
and the hotel,
which sucked big time.

389
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:37,564
The hotel. What...

390
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:38,774
It was not... It sucked. Okay.

391
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:39,941
I'm sorry to hear
the hotel was bad.

392
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:41,026
The Crestmore...

393
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,112
And thanks for the tip on the concierge.
That was great.

394
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,447
That was great.
That was a...

395
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:46,573
Okay.

396
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:47,741
that was
a really good choice.

397
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:48,825
Hey, hey, hey. Michael.

398
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,118
Please listen for a second.

399
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:52,537
No, David, you listen to me.

400
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,291
Why'd you send her away?
That...

401
00:18:57,585 --> 00:19:02,881
God. You knew I liked her and you
just sent her away, and that...

402
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:05,342
That was a sucky thing to do, man.
Michael.

403
00:19:05,426 --> 00:19:07,302
That was a really
sucky thing to do.

404
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:09,137
Sometimes... Sometimes...

405
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:14,434
Why have I stayed
at Dunder Mifflin for so long?

406
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,020
Certainly not
because of the paycheck

407
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:18,814
'cause I could be making
more money as a doctor

408
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:21,066
or a professional athlete.

409
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,735
I think it's
because they respect me.

410
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:27,155
A boss that will not fire you

411
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,783
even though you
just tell him off

412
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:32,118
right to his face
over the phone,

413
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:34,079
that's respect.

414
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:38,041
You did it, man.
Day one.

415
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:40,502
Congrats.

416
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:41,920
Thanks, man.

417
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:55,433
I'm coming back
the wrong way.

418
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,729
It's not because of you.

419
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:02,107
I don't like graphic design.
That's it.

420
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:06,611
Stop smiling.
I really didn't like it.

421
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,157
It's just designing logos and
stuff, and I miss Scranton,

422
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:14,327
but it is not
because I missed you.

423
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:16,162
I just really
wanted to come home.

424
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:19,291
And I know you said
to come home the right way,

425
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,752
but you can't tell me
what to do. Got it?

426
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:24,421
I missed you.

427
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:26,256
I missed you, too.

428
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:31,761
You're back.

429
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:32,888
Yeah.

430
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,097
Good.

431
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:37,434
I need you to make
five copies of these.

432
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:39,311
I'm not going inside.

433
00:20:39,395 --> 00:20:42,063
All right. First thing
in the morning, then.

434
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,484
Welcome back.

435
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,572
We're back
together again, baby.

436
00:20:50,656 --> 00:20:51,698
We're back.

437
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:53,783
They tried to keep us
apart, but they couldn't.

438
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:55,577
It was like destiny.

439
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:57,746
I realized that,
for whatever reason,

440
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,290
I just couldn't do
better than Kelly.

441
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:01,583
Aw!

442
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:02,709
Yeah.
