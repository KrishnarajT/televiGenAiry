1
00:00:01,121 --> 00:00:04,666
I had no idea, when I got into
that car to go to New York,

2
00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:06,292
that I was going
to be quitting.

3
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:09,462
I got on the ramp, and I
was, like, "Two hours.

4
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:13,132
"Two hours to go. Feeling good.
Crank some tunes.

5
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:14,551
"Should've peed
before I left."

6
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:15,635
Michael,
get to the good part.

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,680
Okay, so,
get up to the building.

8
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:21,432
Revolving door, broken.

9
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:24,811
So I have to take
the normal door.

10
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:26,854
Oh, my God.
At least he's in the building.

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,231
No! No.

12
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:30,149
I was so nervous,
it was the wrong building.

13
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:32,318
I had walked into
the wrong building.

14
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:35,280
He finally has a story
we really wanna hear.

15
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:37,073
And he knows it.

16
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:38,533
Okay, focus, focus.

17
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:41,828
You're in the right building,
you're with the right people,

18
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:42,912
what happened?

19
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:44,581
I looked at Wallace
and I said,

20
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:45,915
"I quit."

21
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,043
And as I turned to leave,
I looked back,

22
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:53,131
and I said, "You have no
idea how high I can fly."

23
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:55,425
You didn't tell him
how sick of him you were?

24
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,718
Why would I do that?

25
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:59,596
Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell
him that he's incompetent or...

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,223
That he's wasted 15
years of your life?

27
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:03,600
Maybe spit in his face?

28
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:06,102
You guys have thought about
this a lot more than I have.

29
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:07,854
I just winged it.

30
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:10,398
I love a good
quitting story.

31
00:01:10,608 --> 00:01:13,151
It makes me feel like I have
control over my own life.

32
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:14,652
Gives me hope.

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,447
Maybe I'll have
one of my own someday.

34
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:20,158
But I dream.

35
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:22,368
So...

36
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:54,692
About a week ago, Michael
gave his two-weeks' notice.

37
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:58,363
And surprisingly, there
is a very big difference

38
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:01,574
between Michael trying
and Michael not trying.

39
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:04,243
Michael, is that Scotch?

40
00:02:04,328 --> 00:02:05,828
Scotch and Splenda.

41
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:08,915
Tastes like Splenda,
gets drunk like Scotch.

42
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:15,046
Clinky. Clinky-clink. Come on.

43
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,506
Come on. Come on.

44
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,840
What am I gonna do?

45
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:19,759
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

46
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:22,345
I'm gonna do a little bit of
this and a little bit of that.

47
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:24,681
I'm gonna stay up all day.

48
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,015
I'm gonna
sleep up all night.

49
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,017
I'm gonna give it a...

50
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:30,061
Ho! Hey Ho!

51
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:34,482
And I'm gonna stop
worrying about calories.

52
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:38,653
Maybe you should go into
your office, close the door

53
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,530
and make some
calls about jobs.

54
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:41,656
I have a job.

55
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,032
For four more days.

56
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:44,867
Do you have any
leads on a job?

57
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,327
Pam, what you don't
understand, at my level,

58
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:48,204
you don't just look in
the want ads for a job.

59
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:49,288
You're headhunted.

60
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:50,415
Have you called
any headhunters?

61
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,625
Any good headhunter knows
that I'm available.

62
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,086
Any really good headhunter will
storm your village at sunset

63
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,964
with overwhelming force and cut off
your head with a ceremonial knife.

64
00:02:58,048 --> 00:03:01,050
Right, 'cause that's
what we're talking about.

65
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:02,635
I need you to go over
these client lists

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,804
and indicate any
wrong or false data.

67
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:07,098
Your "I need you
to" is my command.

68
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:08,349
Okay.

69
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:21,612
Hey, Michael.
Hey.

70
00:03:21,697 --> 00:03:22,905
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

71
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,116
You can talk to me for
as long as you want,

72
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,994
because I have all the
time in the world.

73
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:29,495
Oh, God.

74
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,581
Phyllis.

75
00:03:32,332 --> 00:03:35,793
I just wanted to
tell you that...

76
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:39,255
What's that?
Oh! Hey!

77
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:40,965
What is this about?

78
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:43,885
You know, 'cause you're
leaving and everything.

79
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:44,969
It's a farewell...

80
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,053
Right.

81
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:48,264
So I hope I get to work
with you someday again.

82
00:03:48,348 --> 00:03:49,932
Me, too. Me, too.

83
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,437
Is this wine?
Busted. Yes.

84
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,522
I already have wine.

85
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:00,777
Hello.
Hi.

86
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,236
Isaac Sylvie here
for the interview.

87
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,280
Yes, please have a seat.
It'll be a few minutes.

88
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:05,698
Thank you.

89
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,286
Are you interviewing, too?

90
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,954
Um. Hmm?

91
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:14,123
Interviewing?

92
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:15,792
For?

93
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:16,918
Regional manager.

94
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:19,712
Yes, I am.

95
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:24,133
For regional manager, I've decided
to go with an outside hire.

96
00:04:24,218 --> 00:04:25,968
For obvious reasons.

97
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:28,638
Where you from?
Philly.

98
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:29,972
That's a drive.

99
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:32,809
Yeah, well, this is one of the
few places that's hiring.

100
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:35,269
It's brutal out there.

101
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:43,486
Pam?

102
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,029
When will the new
copier be ready?

103
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:46,447
I'm working on it, Kev.

104
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:48,658
You said it would
be ready by today.

105
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:50,409
And it is today.

106
00:04:50,744 --> 00:04:51,994
It'll be ready soon.

107
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,788
Soon could mean anything.

108
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:55,915
Soon could be three weeks.

109
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,251
Is that what
soon means to you?

110
00:04:58,585 --> 00:04:59,752
Sometimes.

111
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:01,754
Then come back soon.

112
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,842
During the course of business a
copier goes through something called

113
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,593
normal wear and tear.

114
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:10,263
I think it's 75 cents.

115
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,347
That's a lot.

116
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:14,100
Bandit, no! No, no, no!

117
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,062
Yesterday,
they delivered the new one.

118
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,939
But they didn't set it up.

119
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:23,109
So my day just got
a little more interesting.

120
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:30,449
It's monster.com. Singular.

121
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:32,368
Thank you.

122
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:37,164
You work in paper long enough,
you get to know the players.

123
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,710
Hi,
you've reached Prince Paper.

124
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:44,797
We are sad to inform you that after
40 years of serving the community,

125
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:46,716
we are no longer in business.

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,886
Thank you for your support
and may God bless you.

127
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,012
Bye!

128
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,561
What am I gonna do?

129
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:23,252
Yep? Do you want me
to come into your office?

130
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:28,507
Okay.

131
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:30,718
All right.

132
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:32,762
Close your eyes.
I'd prefer not to.

133
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,680
Just close your eyes.

134
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,812
I'm going to start
my own paper company.

135
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,607
You're starting your own
paper company. Yeah!

136
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:46,484
Why?
Can you believe...

137
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:50,029
'Cause I know paper. I know everything
there is to know about paper.

138
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:51,572
Do you that the
industry's in decline?

139
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:54,408
Yeah. Oh, God, I practically
invented decline.

140
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:55,493
Right.

141
00:06:55,577 --> 00:06:58,037
I know paper,
I know how to manage.

142
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:59,455
I have a name.
Close your eyes.

143
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,123
No, I did that before.
It added nothing.

144
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,875
Close them.
Okay.

145
00:07:03,168 --> 00:07:05,878
All right.
Michael Scott Paper Company.

146
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,382
You want in? Do you want
to be a part of this?

147
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:12,218
I am not going to do this.

148
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:14,220
Obviously.

149
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:15,972
And you are not
going to, either.

150
00:07:16,765 --> 00:07:18,557
Agreed. Except...

151
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:19,684
Here's the thing.

152
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,144
What I wish for you is that
you land a job at a company

153
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:25,648
that A, exists,
and B, has a salary,

154
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:28,067
because they're set up
to do that kind of thing.

155
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:30,903
What's up, Chuck?

156
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,321
Jim, what are you doing?

157
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,698
Nothing. Just talking.

158
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:35,616
Okay. Michael handed in
his two-week notice.

159
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,201
Did you also hand in your two-week...
I didn't.

160
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:38,577
No? Okay.

161
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,375
After you.
No, I'm staying.

162
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,459
Okay.

163
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:57,722
Do you want me to translate the
German instructions for you?

164
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:00,349
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the
same as the English instructions.

165
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:03,686
Typical American arrogance
that got us involved

166
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,980
in a war we never
should have been in.

167
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:08,441
That's a really...
World War ll.

168
00:08:09,943 --> 00:08:14,280
Well, fine, did the German instructions
say what this is supposed to do?

169
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,743
Let me see here.

170
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:21,996
That is either
an incense dispenser

171
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:25,624
or a ceremonial

172
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:29,128
sarcophagus.
Hmm.

173
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:32,965
My German is preindustrial
and mostly religious.

174
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:38,512
Pam, listen.

175
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,682
This order form, instead of
saying Dunder Mifflin at the top,

176
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,809
is there any way I could get
it to say something else?

177
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,728
Like Michael Scott
Paper Company?

178
00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:47,438
You...

179
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:50,399
Somebody's been talking in bed.
Pillow talk.

180
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:52,610
Yeah. Listen, Michael.

181
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,153
Have you really
thought this through?

182
00:08:54,237 --> 00:08:55,863
'Cause it's
a pretty big risk.

183
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,824
This is a dream

184
00:08:59,576 --> 00:09:02,495
that I have had since lunch and
I am not giving up on it now.

185
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,873
Yeah. You could give
it up, though, right?

186
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,541
And almost no one would know.

187
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:11,420
Before you got here, I'm the one
who landed all of these clients.

188
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:12,922
Half of them. At least.

189
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,924
I can do it again.
I know the market.

190
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,425
I know the price points.

191
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,843
I'm on it. Don't worry.

192
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,679
So, how do I do that?

193
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:23,015
Well,

194
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:27,228
you can scan it, and then
you can upload the image,

195
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:28,354
and then you can
copy a new image...

196
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:29,438
Could I take a piece of paper

197
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:32,691
and just tape it
with transparent tape?

198
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,028
Yeah. Good.

199
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:38,322
Thank you very much.

200
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:40,866
So that is why I have to
leave at 5:00 on Tuesdays.

201
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,577
It's to pick up my little
sisters from school.

202
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:45,913
We're really tight.
We're like the Kardashians.

203
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:47,915
You know, you can run
this stuff by Toby.

204
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,208
Yeah, I don't like talking...

205
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:50,626
Come in.
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,628
I didn't realize
you were with anyone.

207
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:55,297
But I just wanted to bring you the
brochure on that accounting seminar

208
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,383
that I was telling
you about earlier.

209
00:09:57,467 --> 00:09:59,135
Okay, we're in the middle
of something, Angela, so...

210
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:02,096
Actually, you know,
it was so much fun last year.

211
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,639
There was a sundae bar.

212
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:04,932
I mean,
I didn't have any.

213
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,725
You know,
to stay trim.

214
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,062
Did Michael just let
anybody in his office?

215
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:11,772
Yes. He loved to
facilitate communication.

216
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:13,399
He loved it. He invited
us in all the time.

217
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,442
He was, like, "Come in."
Yeah.

218
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:18,362
I am aware of the effect
I have on women.

219
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:21,240
So you should be heading
back to your desk.

220
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,368
Okay. Bye, Charles.

221
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:26,704
Well, you'll let me know.
Goodbye.

222
00:10:28,707 --> 00:10:31,292
She's such
a special person.

223
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,419
She's turning 50 this year.

224
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:36,672
I'm starting
my own paper company.

225
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,424
No way!
Yeah.

226
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,260
In this climate?

227
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:42,511
In all climates.

228
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:44,471
It's going to be worldwide.

229
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:47,516
And I'm looking for some
talented salesmen to join me.

230
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,393
That's where you come in.

231
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:55,983
Well, it's a very intriguing
concept, isn't it?

232
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:04,283
Michael is starting
his own paper company.

233
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:07,077
What do you think
about that?

234
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:10,206
Your own paper company?

235
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,707
Can you believe it?
Well, we'll see.

236
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,958
We'll see.
Wow.

237
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:15,419
It's just a... It's a nugget
of an idea right now.

238
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:16,545
Right.

239
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,589
Potential.
Lots of potential. Yes.

240
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:22,009
What a courageous venture.

241
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:24,803
It's very courageous
and very exciting.

242
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,097
Location is hard for me
with the farm...

243
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:28,265
That's what
I was thinking.

244
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,309
and the responsibilities, so...
That's what I was thinking.

245
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:32,686
With the farm. You getting to wherever...
It's so crucial...

246
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:34,813
I'm gonna put my thing.

247
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:36,523
Okay.
So, think about it.

248
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:37,691
Yeah.
Let's put a pin in it for now.

249
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:40,277
You know, I would love
to put a pin in that.

250
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:42,488
Everyone, can I have
your attention?

251
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:45,699
This is the moment you've
all been waiting for.

252
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:47,368
Right?

253
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:50,412
Little Miss Thing
wants attention.

254
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,081
Thanks, Meredith.

255
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:58,170
Oh!

256
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,172
So...

257
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:03,133
G-44.

258
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:08,347
It's not ready, Kevin!

259
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:11,225
I am at a crucial point where
I have sunk four hours

260
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:12,935
into that copier.

261
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,397
And I am not gonna let it beat me
like that wireless router did.

262
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,782
You put a note in my food?
I made it sterile.

263
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,284
Just saying sterile
doesn't make it so.

264
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:32,079
I am offering you the opportunity
of a lifetime, Oscar,

265
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:33,747
to come work for me.

266
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:35,624
Do you have
a business plan?

267
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,043
A funding request, market
research, financials...

268
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,128
No, no, no!

269
00:12:39,212 --> 00:12:40,212
You need those things...

270
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:41,839
Most new businesses,

271
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:44,591
they don't make a profit
till at least two years.

272
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:47,303
And then your margins
will be razor-thin.

273
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:48,554
Best-case scenario,

274
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:50,806
you don't cut yourself a salary
for at least five years.

275
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,641
Can you go five years
without a salary, Michael?

276
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:54,059
Okay.
Five years?

277
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,185
You already have the job.

278
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,562
You don't have
to convince me.

279
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:58,355
It's just not prudent,
Michael.

280
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Stanley.

281
00:12:59,524 --> 00:13:00,733
Can't you see
I'm urinating?

282
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:03,402
Listen. Listen, Stanley, you
don't need to answer me now.

283
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:04,486
No.

284
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:05,863
Just... I want you
to think about it.

285
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:07,239
I am starting
my own company.

286
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:08,324
No.

287
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:09,992
Okay, you're not
letting me finish.

288
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:11,535
And you just lost out
on a million dollars.

289
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:13,620
No, I didn't.

290
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,205
You know what?

291
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:17,333
I had a great time at prom.

292
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:20,711
And no one said yes
to that, either.

293
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:22,880
How's it working?

294
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:25,591
Let's see.

295
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:27,676
Yeah, it's fine.

296
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:29,136
Good.

297
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,889
I did it. I learned everything
about this machine.

298
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:34,975
I know all the buttons.
Even the inside ones.

299
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,229
I know all the error messages.
I could do a bound book

300
00:13:39,397 --> 00:13:42,066
in plastic
with offset colors,

301
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:44,777
which feels...

302
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:54,870
Hey, Hank.

303
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:56,038
You ready?
Yeah.

304
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:57,122
Okay.

305
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,084
Michael?

306
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:01,585
I can't pretend
I haven't seen that.

307
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:04,963
So I'm gonna ask you
to stand up, walk out

308
00:14:05,048 --> 00:14:06,507
and you can't
take anything.

309
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,549
Okay.

310
00:14:07,634 --> 00:14:08,717
I have immunity.
It's my two weeks.

311
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:09,802
Not if you're starting

312
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:11,845
a competing paper
company, Michael.

313
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,639
Hank.

314
00:14:13,848 --> 00:14:15,766
Okay, Michael.
Hank?

315
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:18,519
You really think Hank is
going to be loyal to you?

316
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:21,647
Hank, please escort Charles
from the building.

317
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,819
Come on, man, let's go.

318
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:31,657
I always thought
Michael got a bad rap.

319
00:14:31,741 --> 00:14:34,326
He's a good guy.
And he's super funny.

320
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,789
Yeah, maybe I should
tell him before he goes.

321
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,376
He's all the way over there.

322
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:49,133
Well, here we are.
I would just like to...

323
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:50,759
No. No, no, no.

324
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,594
You're done, Michael.

325
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:03,021
All right then, everybody,
I'm out of here!

326
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,942
What is he doing?

327
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:09,027
It looks like
he's saying something.

328
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:12,156
I think he's singing.

329
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,658
I can't believe this
is really happening.

330
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:18,245
And I feel free!

331
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,627
And just like that, as
mysteriously as he arrived,

332
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:27,546
he was gone.

333
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,685
The whole office
feels darker.

334
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:43,645
You know?

335
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:47,691
It's just a sad, dark day.

336
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:49,526
Andy, he's gone.

337
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:50,777
I know.

338
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:53,071
You don't have to
kiss his ass anymore.

339
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,158
Michael's like
a movie on a plane.

340
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:59,036
You know, it's not great,
but it's something to watch.

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,704
And then when it's over,
you're, like,

342
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:02,789
how much time is left
on this flight?

343
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,541
You know. Now what?

344
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:13,967
Michael?

345
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:16,887
Don't look down.
Look straight up.

346
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:26,647
Come on. Please.

347
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,232
These are for employees only.

348
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:29,566
Angela, Kevin,
help me out.

349
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:31,735
I just need a few things,
and then I'll be gone.

350
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:33,862
Michael, why is it that
you asked everyone

351
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:37,032
except me, Angela,
Creed and Meredith?

352
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:39,451
I was going to.
I wanted to.

353
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:41,203
But I had to
start somewhere.

354
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,579
And you didn't want
to start with us?

355
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:43,705
No.

356
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,542
Of course not.
But now I want everybody.

357
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:49,002
Jim.

358
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,089
Buddy.

359
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,300
Buddy. Jimbo.

360
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:59,846
Did you have time to
think about my offer?

361
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,390
I did have a chance
to think about it,

362
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:02,683
but then I thought
about something else.

363
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:03,934
So, which way
are you leaning?

364
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:06,979
Well, it is tempting, but I am
100% leaning towards passing.

365
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:08,063
That's...

366
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,815
Did anyone see
the client list

367
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:11,900
that Michael was supposed
to be working on?

368
00:17:11,985 --> 00:17:13,026
No.

369
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,653
Okay, let me know
if you find it.

370
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:17,614
Okay.

371
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:25,414
Okay.

372
00:17:25,498 --> 00:17:27,541
Okay,
we don't have much time.

373
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,167
Just act normal.

374
00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:31,086
Don't look at me.
People, stop.

375
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,088
Don't look down. Don't look down.
He's gonna see me.

376
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:35,465
Not all the way up. Keep
them at a normal height.

377
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,176
Okay? This is not Michael
Scott talking right now.

378
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:40,762
This is your future. Hello.

379
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:42,723
I am your future.

380
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,434
You are older and
you are very happy now,

381
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:48,645
because you went with
Michael Scott, right?

382
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:51,565
So, everybody,
come on down.

383
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:55,235
And let's just crawl out of
here together, all right?

384
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:59,823
Come on! Are you doing
your best here?

385
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:03,035
Are you being the best
that you can be?

386
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:05,871
All right, everybody
who's gonna go with me,

387
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:07,664
I want you
to stomp your foot.

388
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,419
Okay.

389
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:14,755
All right. Come on.

390
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,299
Come on.

391
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:20,135
You're coming with me.
Come on, Phyllis.

392
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:24,890
Here we go.

393
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:27,225
Here we go.

394
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:29,728
Michael, get up.
Oh, God, okay.

395
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:31,146
All right, all right.
Time to go.

396
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,023
Time to go. Jim, let's go.
Come on.

397
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:34,316
Come on!
Michael!

398
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,359
What are you doing?

399
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:36,818
I think maybe Hank
should be here.

400
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:39,446
Hank? You know,
I don't need Hank.

401
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:41,490
You're gonna mess with me?
Is that what you're gonna do?

402
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:44,284
I'll tell you something, Charles.
I don't even care,

403
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,036
because I've got
nothing to lose.

404
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,996
Okay.
Oh, my God. No, God! No!

405
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:50,499
No. All right.
It's not worth it.

406
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:04,179
Oh, no.
What?

407
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:06,682
I'm going with him.

408
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:07,933
What? Pam.

409
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,351
I'm going!

410
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:12,396
Pam, you can't be serious.

411
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:14,690
Michael, wait!

412
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,984
I'm coming with you.

413
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,196
You are?

414
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:22,989
Yeah.

415
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:28,370
Okay. It's gonna be great.

416
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:32,457
Great. Except I don't want to
be a receptionist anymore.

417
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:35,001
Right.

418
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:36,962
Executive assistant.

419
00:19:37,046 --> 00:19:38,130
Salesman.

420
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:41,383
All right. Okay.

421
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:43,468
Deal.
Deal.

422
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:45,345
Okay, well, Jim?

423
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,430
Still no.

424
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:47,931
Okay.
Yeah.

425
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:49,641
Well, let's go.

426
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,768
All my stuff is
still upstairs.

427
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:53,270
Are people watching?

428
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:54,563
Probably.

429
00:19:56,649 --> 00:19:58,567
Michael, it's not how you leave an office.
It's how you...

430
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:00,026
Jim, Jim, Jim.

431
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,070
We're having
a company meeting here.

432
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:05,365
I will bring all your stuff home.
Okay.

433
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,825
All right.
I'll see you later.

434
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:08,660
Bye.
See you later.

435
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,972
So, we had
a personnel change today.

436
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,682
Shouldn't affect
our day-to-day,

437
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:34,686
but until we get a new receptionist,
I want Kevin on the phones.

438
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,688
Phones?

439
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,191
Also, there's been
way too much wasting time.

440
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,442
So, Stanley?
Yes?

441
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:42,068
Yeah, I want you
on top of that.

442
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:44,571
Okay, I want you to be
my productivity czar.

443
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:46,031
Okay? Good.

444
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:48,950
Okay, that's it on my list.

445
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:51,953
So, no excuses, guys.
Let's get going, okay?
