1
00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:03,316
At least once a year,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,737
I like to bring in some of
my Kevin's Famous Chili.

3
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:11,908
The trick is to
undercook the onions.

4
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:15,828
Everybody is going to get to
know each other in the pot.

5
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:18,539
Now, I'm serious
about this stuff.

6
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:23,586
I'm up the night before, pressing
garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.

7
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,756
I toast my own
Ancho chilies.

8
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:33,054
It's a recipe passed down
from Malones for generations.

9
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:37,266
It's probably
the thing I do best.

10
00:01:03,711 --> 00:01:06,295
Someone
is returning.

11
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:09,841
He started his own company,
and now he's back.

12
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:11,551
Who could it be?

13
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:15,179
I'll give you a hint.
He is a man.

14
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,182
A man you have missed
with all your heart.

15
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:21,644
A man who has ruined
all other men for you.

16
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,646
Who is it?

17
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:25,898
Who is it?
Who is it?

18
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:35,074
It's Michael Scott.

19
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:39,746
Hold up!

20
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,664
Conference room,
five minutes.

21
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:47,420
Well, I guess the first
order of business

22
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:50,173
is to welcome back
me and Pam and Ryan.

23
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:57,805
And how about Casual Friday again, huh?
Reinstituting Casual Friday?

24
00:01:58,766 --> 00:01:59,932
You all look great.

25
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:03,936
What I want to do right now is try
something a little different.

26
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,355
I'm going to throw it out there,
starting with this meeting.

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,234
I want you guys to run it. I want
you to say whatever you want.

28
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,236
Take it away.
Your meeting.

29
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,073
What are you doing?

30
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:18,785
If there is something that you
would like to say as a group,

31
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:22,079
then by all means, you may
say it to me right now.

32
00:02:22,206 --> 00:02:23,456
- Okay.
- Yes.

33
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,124
People are dressed
inappropriately.

34
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,960
Take it up with Toby.
What I want you to do

35
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,129
is I want you
to look inward,

36
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:33,925
and I want you to reflect, and I
want you to say something different.

37
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:35,384
Can you give us a hint?

38
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,971
When I needed salespeople
for my new paper company,

39
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:41,724
everyone here turned
their back on me.

40
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,145
Am I going to ask them to
beg for forgiveness? No.

41
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,400
Am I going to ask for a
big, crying apology? No.

42
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:55,071
Am I going to ask them to
slit their wrists for me? No.

43
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:58,991
I just want a tiny,
microscopic version of that.

44
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,993
Oscar, what were
you going to say?

45
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:03,621
Nothing. I didn't
say anything.

46
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:04,705
All right.

47
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,208
Do I still have a job here?
Not important.

48
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:08,835
Michael, she's...
Okay.

49
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,670
All right,
yes, yes.

50
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:13,130
She deserves to know.
You have a job.

51
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:16,759
Frankly, you have a job
because Ryan and Pam

52
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:19,095
are starting with us
as salesmen.

53
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:21,305
Wait, what? How is
that going to work?

54
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,849
It's going
to work very smoothly

55
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,517
because Pam and Ryan
are bringing over

56
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:27,478
a ton of clients from Michael
Scott Paper Company and...

57
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,188
You mean the clients
you stole from us.

58
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:30,815
Yeah, aren't we getting
those clients back?

59
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:32,692
No, you lost
those clients.

60
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:34,694
I call foul, sir.
Okay.

61
00:03:34,778 --> 00:03:35,903
You were bought out.
They...

62
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:39,198
So the company, then, bought
out all of the stolen clients.

63
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:41,742
Okay, Dwight, let me
explain something to you.

64
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:45,913
I set the rules, and you
follow them blindly, okay?

65
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:48,499
And if you have
a problem with that,

66
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:52,003
then you can talk to
our complaint department.

67
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:53,963
It's a trashcan.

68
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,804
Don't fall in
love with me, kid.

69
00:04:07,936 --> 00:04:10,229
Boscov's
at the Steamtown Mall?

70
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:12,023
It sure looked good
on the mannequin.

71
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,275
Well, you have good taste.
Well, thanks.

72
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,570
I sure wish I had more time to
talk to my clients, though.

73
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:18,654
What?

74
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,699
Isn't that what you said to a bunch of
my clients when you were stealing them?

75
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,451
That I didn't have
enough time for them?

76
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,077
Oh, I, uh...

77
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:27,788
Close your mouth, sweetie.
You look like a trout.

78
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,876
The man is
wearing sandals.

79
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,962
I don't need to see Oscar's
toes at work. Gross.

80
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:37,423
I mean, he looks like
he just got off the boat.

81
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:39,800
Can't you just not
look at his feet?

82
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:41,218
Excuse me?

83
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:44,388
Oh! You're so educated,
aren't you, Toby?

84
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:46,182
So trained to deal
with a hysterical woman!

85
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:48,184
I don't want to
look at his feet!

86
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:49,894
Do your job!

87
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:53,105
Well, I was in the seminary
for a year and dropped out

88
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,025
'cause I wanted to have sex
with this girl Kathy.

89
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:58,194
Followed her
back to Scranton,

90
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:00,363
took the first job
I could find in HR.

91
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,491
Later, she divorced me.

92
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:08,663
So, no, I wouldn't say
I have a passion for HR.

93
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:13,125
There you are, my friend.
Oh. Thanks, man.

94
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,170
Pamela.

95
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:18,464
Thanks, Michael.
Yep.

96
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:25,179
Fresh, hot ink.

97
00:05:26,223 --> 00:05:27,807
New file system?

98
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:32,478
Trust me, Stanley, you're going to
want to read this memo very carefully.

99
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:35,439
I am not changing
the way I do my files.

100
00:05:35,524 --> 00:05:38,067
No, no! This goes
for all of you.

101
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:44,323
Believe me, you are going
to want to heat my words.

102
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:47,076
When held over heat, the
invisible ink will reveal

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,162
that everyone should meet
at the warehouse immediately.

104
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,749
Do not ask me where
I got the invisible ink.

105
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:57,795
Urine. It was urine.

106
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,843
I'm sorry you're
offended by my shoes,

107
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,262
but I'm not going to
drive home to change.

108
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,681
Okay. I could loan you
a pair of socks. No.

109
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:10,016
No, they're clean.
I was gonna wear them

110
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,475
to volleyball practice.
I don't think so.

111
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:15,855
Andrew Bernard.

112
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:18,065
Okay, what are you
still doing at your desk?

113
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,609
What are you still
doing not at your desk?

114
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:23,112
Did you even
read the memo?

115
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:25,322
All my files are now in
reverse alphabetical order...

116
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:29,618
No, you idiot! There is a
code embedded in the memo.

117
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:32,955
Listen, you need to round up all the
salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam,

118
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,666
and get them down to
the warehouse, pronto.

119
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,170
Oh, it is on, like a
prawn who yawns at dawn.

120
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:41,047
Stop doing
rhyming poetry.

121
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:43,340
Just tell them, please.
God, the simplest thing.

122
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,303
We're in crisis
mode here.

123
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,847
Do you understand
that two unqualified

124
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,433
so-called salespeople
are being favored

125
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:54,977
because they all
failed together?

126
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:56,896
And frankly, I'm not convinced
that Michael and Pam

127
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,606
didn't have a thing going
while they were gone.

128
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,690
Can I address that?

129
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:00,858
No, you're too close.
Okay.

130
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:03,110
Stanley, how do you feel about
those two taking your clients?

131
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,321
It's not right.
I don't like it.

132
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:06,739
He doesn't like it.

133
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:09,408
You don't take my clients away
and give them to a secretary.

134
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:12,411
No offense, Jim.
I think she's very pretty.

135
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:14,246
Her face is okay,
but...

136
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:17,083
Jeez, what... What
are you doing here?

137
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,668
I don't know. I saw a crowd. Thought
there might be a dog fight or...

138
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,003
Get out!

139
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:23,422
We need to
do something.

140
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:26,592
I'm thinking maybe a coup,
or we take Ryan hostage.

141
00:07:26,676 --> 00:07:27,718
Those sound too harsh.

142
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:29,095
No, I'm not saying
we do those things.

143
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:31,180
I'm saying something
like those things.

144
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:32,973
Of course.
What is like a hostage?

145
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,308
Excellent question.

146
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:36,477
We could write a
strongly worded letter.

147
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,978
Words will never
be enough.

148
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:40,314
Strongly painted picture. No,
pictures are too interpretive.

149
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:42,817
Can I just say something?
I know that tempers are high.

150
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:43,984
But I think the best
way to handle this

151
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:45,694
might be to just talk
to Michael directly.

152
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,530
Oh.

153
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:50,866
That... That's a
great idea, Jim.

154
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,326
I totally see
your point.

155
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,788
Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly,
so, uh, meeting is over, I guess.

156
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:57,456
I'll see everyone upstairs.
Great. See you upstairs.

157
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,582
Come on.

158
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:04,713
Listen, now is the time for action.
I'm talking...

159
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,135
That one's great.
I know.

160
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:10,469
- Why are you so mad?
- You look so classy.

161
00:08:10,554 --> 00:08:11,720
I do? Well...

162
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:17,518
Hi, you have a second? Michael
Scott Paper Company only.

163
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:19,228
Yeah, I think you're gonna
wanna cool it with that,

164
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:21,063
'cause it's starting to
upset the other salesmen.

165
00:08:21,148 --> 00:08:22,273
Okay, well...
Tough.

166
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:24,191
I will... No. No.

167
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,152
I'll talk to them when they all
get back from the bathroom.

168
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:28,821
This is awkward to talk about,
but there may or may not be,

169
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:31,991
but definitely is, a mutiny forming
in the warehouse right now.

170
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,535
Against who?
You.

171
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:36,453
Us.
What?

172
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:38,455
It's gotta be because they
all want their clients...

173
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,833
The old Michael Scott
might have taken this,

174
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,960
but not the new
Michael Scott.

175
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:47,882
They are in for a bitter surprise.
I am not to be truffled with.

176
00:08:48,758 --> 00:08:52,094
Six weeks ago, none of these
people wanted to come with me.

177
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,431
You two were the only ones
with the stones to follow.

178
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:56,557
Mmm-hmm.

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,393
That was us, right there.
We were something else.

180
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:02,771
What you gotta do is you gotta
go down to that warehouse

181
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,482
and you gotta crack some skulls,
Chiklis style. Mmm-hmm.

182
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,318
Yeah, The Commish.

183
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:10,112
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style...
Okay.

184
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:12,489
not Commish style.
Yeah, yeah. The Shield.

185
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:18,621
It's crazy, what's going
on out there today, huh?

186
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:21,665
I know. Yeah,
it's kinda...

187
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,959
Sometimes it's best
just to stay out of it.

188
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,670
That's true.
That's right, yeah.

189
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:28,964
Want to play a game?

190
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:36,931
Hey, gang,
where you been?

191
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,433
Lunch.

192
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,685
Where'd you eat?
A restaurant.

193
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,145
What did you
have, Stanley?

194
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,023
I had a salmon salad
with water, no ice.

195
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:48,525
I was going to get a soda, but the
waitress talked me out of it.

196
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,069
Her name was Flo.
She had black hair.

197
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:51,195
I had Mexican food.

198
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,446
So since you
guys already ate,

199
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,283
you won't be eating the stuff that you
brought with you for lunch, will you?

200
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,961
Wow, Stanley,
is that egg salad?

201
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:08,629
Andy brought
some salmon.

202
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:09,838
That looks great.

203
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:12,633
Dwight, is that
a meat sandwich?

204
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:14,593
You guys hungry?
I can eat.

205
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:17,304
I'm going to have some
of this meat sandwich.

206
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:19,390
It's pony.

207
00:10:19,683 --> 00:10:22,059
Mmm! What kind of sauce
is on your salmon?

208
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:24,770
Dijonnaise.

209
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,689
Thanks for going out, guys.
Mmm-hmm.

210
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:30,192
Hey, Meredith, can I talk to
you privately for a second?

211
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,569
About what?
Your outfit.

212
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:34,697
What? What's wrong
with my outfit?

213
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:38,534
You might consider
pulling it down a touch.

214
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:41,370
It's riding up
a little high.

215
00:10:41,454 --> 00:10:44,081
Bunch of prudes. You know,
Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,

216
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:45,958
but I'm not allowed to
wear open-toed shoes?

217
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,459
Is that how it goes?

218
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:48,919
Meredith, your boob is out.

219
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:50,045
Fine.

220
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:53,757
Damn it, Meredith, where
are your panties?

221
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:55,426
It's casual day.

222
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,220
Happy?

223
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,269
- Toby.
- Toby.

224
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:06,478
Toby?

225
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:09,857
No. If you do that,
I'm going to do that.

226
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:11,567
If you do that,
I'm going to do that.

227
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:13,569
If you do this,
I'm going to do that.

228
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,447
What if I just do this?

229
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,198
You don't want
to do that.

230
00:11:19,242 --> 00:11:22,119
I'm just hiding out until
all this stuff blows over,

231
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:25,664
with Creed, playing
chess, at work.

232
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:27,750
He's winning.

233
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:32,379
I feel like I'm
describing a dream I had.

234
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:34,757
I'm sorry you feel
that way, Mr. Bart.

235
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:38,093
Is there anything I can do
to make things better?

236
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:40,554
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

237
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,182
Exactly, if this is your first complaint
in 10 years... That's my client.

238
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:45,225
things have been generally good.
Give me the phone.

239
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,435
Tell him Dwight Schrute
wants to talk to him.

240
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,145
- Look, Mr. Bart...
- Hi, Mr. Bart!

241
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:50,230
at these prices, with this service...
Hey, it's Dwight here!

242
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:51,732
you're not going to
find this anywhere else.

243
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:53,108
Dwight Schrute here. Hey,
don't hang up, Mr. Bart.

244
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,486
No, sir, don't listen... Listen, I
know times are tough right now,

245
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:56,779
and I laud your thriftiness.
Look, let me...

246
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:58,405
Ryan, hand
the phone over!

247
00:11:58,448 --> 00:11:59,948
Stop flustering me,
everybody!

248
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,950
Who let this boy
on the phone?

249
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:03,160
Mr. Bart!

250
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:06,789
I cannot believe
you lost that account!

251
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,874
He was my client
for 10 years!

252
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,211
You made him lose the account by
screaming at him the entire time!

253
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:13,379
It's okay, Ryan.

254
00:12:13,463 --> 00:12:16,048
You're a secretary!
What do you know?

255
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:18,092
And you're a temp!
And I'm taking your phone.

256
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:20,052
I'm confiscating this!
Hey, guys...

257
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:23,097
You know what I want you to do?
Shake hands, get over it.

258
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:28,727
That was not
a shake, Dwight.

259
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,105
We want our clients back
or we quit, Michael.

260
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:32,564
Who quits?

261
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:34,525
Me.

262
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:36,735
And me.
Me, too.

263
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
You guys gotta be kidding.

264
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,405
No, we gotta be
deadly serious.

265
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:41,115
We'll start our
own paper company.

266
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:46,161
The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-
Vance-Stanley Paper Company.

267
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:49,748
I love it! I love this idea,
and I fully support you.

268
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,293
As a matter of fact, I'm going
to give you some seed money.

269
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:55,712
There you go. There's
some seed money for you.

270
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:57,631
And you can take it,
no hard feelings,

271
00:12:57,715 --> 00:13:00,217
but if you stay,
I want an apology,

272
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:01,301
and I want a big one.

273
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,804
You want us to apologize to you?
Yes, I do.

274
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:05,431
That's completely backwards.

275
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:06,640
It's frontwards!

276
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,725
Michael, you thought you
were attacking Corporate,

277
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,185
but we were the
ones who got hurt.

278
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,603
You should be
apologizing to us.

279
00:13:11,688 --> 00:13:12,771
That's right.

280
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:17,818
Michael, you always said we were a family.
Then you went after us.

281
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:24,032
No matter how I look at
this, I am in the wrong.

282
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:28,954
And I have looked at this thing
like 100 different ways,

283
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:32,374
from my point of view,
from their point of view,

284
00:13:34,711 --> 00:13:39,339
98 others, and bottom
line, I am in the wrong.

285
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:40,716
I'm the bad guy.

286
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,761
I need you
to arrange a meeting

287
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:46,555
between me and
the sales staff

288
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,849
without Ryan
and Pam knowing.

289
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,267
Gasp.

290
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:52,478
Are you talking
about a secret meeting?

291
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:54,646
Whatever you guys
did earlier.

292
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,316
I don't know the first thing
about secret meetings.

293
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,319
Just do it, okay? Get them there.
Get them there.

294
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:01,653
I'll do the best
I can, Michael.

295
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:02,779
Are you kidding me?

296
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:05,574
Deceit does not come easy to me.
Okay, okay, okay.

297
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,336
I really love
your outfit.

298
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,004
Thank you so much
for saying that.

299
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,381
I can't believe that Toby
thinks this is inappropriate.

300
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:22,841
You look like J-Lo.

301
00:14:23,259 --> 00:14:25,427
So, from the bottom
of my heart

302
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:28,180
to the top of
my heart, I am sorry.

303
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:29,848
Are you giving us
our clients back?

304
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:32,309
If we could just focus
and go down the line,

305
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:35,020
and everyone would say,
"Apology accepted,"

306
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:36,605
I think we would
all feel better,

307
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,484
and then we can break
out my gift to you,

308
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:42,694
complimentary
white chocolate bark.

309
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,696
Nobody likes that stuff,
except for you.

310
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,782
They wouldn't make it
unless people liked it.

311
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:49,284
Michael, just give us our clients back.
That's all we care about.

312
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:51,203
Okay, if I give you
your clients back,

313
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,372
there won't be enough
clients for Pam and Ryan,

314
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,624
and I promised both of them that
they were going to be salespeople.

315
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,876
So?
Fine, have your clients.

316
00:14:58,002 --> 00:15:00,546
I can see that's what you
wanted all along. Okay.

317
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,339
However,
I rescind my apology.

318
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,507
- That's fair.
- Absolutely.

319
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:06,093
You are not reacting
at all as I had hoped.

320
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:15,978
What did I tell you about
building forts in my warehouse?

321
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:21,400
Michael gave all of our clients
back to their old salespeople.

322
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:23,735
So now there's not enough for
both me and Pam to stay on.

323
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,029
He can only keep one of
us as a salesperson now.

324
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:27,781
He'll make his decision
by the end of the day.

325
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:29,324
I think you
should get it.

326
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,660
You really
grew into it.

327
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:33,078
Oh.

328
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:35,080
I think you
should get it.

329
00:15:35,164 --> 00:15:37,583
You've changed a lot,
and you'd be good at it.

330
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,128
If you really think that, will
you tell that to Michael?

331
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:43,714
That would go a long
way, coming from you.

332
00:15:43,798 --> 00:15:44,923
Yeah.

333
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:46,216
Thanks.

334
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:50,304
So, hey, I want to set
you up with my daughter.

335
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:52,931
Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.

336
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:54,016
I thought you were gay.

337
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,476
Then why would you want to set
me up with your daughter?

338
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,978
I don't know.

339
00:15:58,062 --> 00:15:59,605
Jim, could I talk
to you for a minute?

340
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,732
Sure, let me just
finish this turn.

341
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:06,445
And Bingo was
his name-o.

342
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:09,406
Let's go.
Challenge.

343
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:11,950
I need your help.

344
00:16:12,035 --> 00:16:14,494
This whole Pam-Ryan debate
is screwing with my head.

345
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,331
Well, I don't want to be biased, but I
am very close to Ryan. You know that.

346
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:18,707
You're close
with Pam, too.

347
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,209
Oh. She's nice, I guess.
You know what?

348
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,711
Best thing to do,
pros and cons list.

349
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:26,548
Pro for Ryan, he went to business school.
He's my number-one choice.

350
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,175
Well, that's...
I like his hair.

351
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:31,428
Cons, Ryan, he
defrauded the company.

352
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:33,138
He has never made a sale. Okay.

353
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:34,306
He definitely
stole my iPod.

354
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,807
That sounds pretty biased.

355
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:37,142
You didn't
hear my pros.

356
00:16:37,226 --> 00:16:39,770
Environmentally conscious, 'cause his
mom drives him to work every day.

357
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:42,648
Okay. Pam, pros, I like her.
Mmm-hmm.

358
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,901
I think that she
is a fast learner.

359
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,694
Cons, she doesn't
always follow through.

360
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:50,072
New York and the whole
art school thing.

361
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:51,156
And Roy.

362
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,783
She has a weird voice.
That's not true.

363
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:53,950
I don't need to
tell you that.

364
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,536
I think she'd be a
really good salesperson.

365
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:59,331
I don't think you're being
totally impartial, though,

366
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:01,375
because you haven't said
one bad thing about Pam.

367
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,001
And I won't.
Okay.

368
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:05,212
So be it. Then you've
lost credibility,

369
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:07,881
and I'm going to go with
my gut, and that's Ryan.

370
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:09,091
Okay.

371
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,927
You're right. Sometimes,
when she is tired,

372
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,387
she can be
a little bit shrill,

373
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,555
but that's not a weird
voice, that's just...

374
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:18,475
Take it easy.

375
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,395
Oh. Man! Wow!

376
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:22,688
"Honey!

377
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:27,192
"I want you to
put the garbage out!

378
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:29,027
"'Cause I'm not gonna
have sex with you

379
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,946
"unless you bring
out the garbage!"

380
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:37,536
I have a very difficult
decision to make.

381
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,581
It's like last week
I was at the video store.

382
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,876
Do I rent Devil
Wears Prada again

383
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:48,004
or do I finally get around
to seeing Sophie's Choice?

384
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,342
It is what you would call a
classic difficult decision.

385
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,888
You don't understand
clothing, Toby!

386
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:59,599
You're dressed like this
amorphous blob of khaki.

387
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:00,934
All right, look, what
you've got to understand is

388
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:02,436
when you come to work,

389
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,065
Listen up, Flenderson, you're
being weak and ineffectual.

390
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,067
I'm cowboying
this meeting, okay?

391
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:11,903
Here are the new rules,
okay? Earth tones only.

392
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:14,239
Also, women are forbidden
to wear pants.

393
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,283
All right, come on,
sit down, Dwight. No.

394
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:17,909
I'm running this meeting.
That's debatable.

395
00:18:17,994 --> 00:18:19,035
It's not.
Listen...

396
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,912
It's not. Sit down,
or I'm writing you up.

397
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,748
Hmm. Where's
this guy been?

398
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:24,207
Casual Fridays
are canceled.

399
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:25,792
What? Let's just
not do it anymore.

400
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:27,544
That's not a solution.
No, it is a solution.

401
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,920
You're running
from the problem.

402
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:30,797
There's not a single
appropriate outfit

403
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:33,049
in this whole... Except
mine, quite honestly.

404
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,844
Pam, could you
come in here, please?

405
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:41,099
Have a seat.

406
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:42,309
Okay.

407
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:47,689
Well, there's no
easy way of saying this,

408
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:52,652
so I think I will
just drag it out.

409
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,282
Since the dawn of time, there have been...
Just tell me.

410
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:58,992
I gave Ryan
the sales job.

411
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,622
There just weren't enough
clients for the two of you.

412
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:05,248
So I had to...

413
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:07,334
I'm sorry. Sorry. No, okay,
okay, I get it, yeah.

414
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:13,131
Why are you giggling?

415
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:17,302
Is this a joke?

416
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:18,595
Michael, is this...

417
00:19:19,555 --> 00:19:20,847
Did I get the job?

418
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:22,265
Yes.

419
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,642
I did?
Yep.

420
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:26,394
For real? You're not
kidding? I did?

421
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,438
No, you're the best person for the job.
You're going to be great.

422
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:30,565
Oh, Michael, thank you!
Okay.

423
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,235
Thank you. Thank you.
You will not be sorry.

424
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:38,323
You should have seen your face.
Oh. Man! That was classic.

425
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,785
I really thought
I didn't get it.

426
00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:42,953
Oh. Really?

427
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:44,037
Yeah.
Man.

428
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:45,539
That was really good.
'Cause you said I didn't.

429
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:47,040
That was really good.

430
00:19:47,124 --> 00:19:48,458
What about Ryan?

431
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:50,836
I don't know. I offered
him his temp job back.

432
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,045
We'll see.

433
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:55,715
He was not happy at all
when I offered him this job,

434
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,968
and then I told him that he
didn't get the job, so...

435
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:00,804
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't
fake-fire people anymore.

436
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:03,431
I don't appreciate you
telling me what to do,

437
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:06,059
so clean out your desk.
You are through.

438
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,521
Thanks, Michael.
Oh.

439
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:11,231
What's our
receptionist's name?

440
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:12,357
Erin.

441
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:13,608
Could you send her in?

442
00:20:17,238 --> 00:20:19,364
Erin, Michael
wants to see you.

443
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,370
Hello.
Hi.

444
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:26,580
Have a seat.

445
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:30,500
This is very
difficult to say.

446
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:33,336
But no one here likes
you in the office,

447
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,755
and we're going to
have to let you go.

448
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:42,262
Hank, would you come up here, please?
Hank is our security guard.

449
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:44,598
Oh. I can go... He will
be ushering you out.

450
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,392
Oh.

451
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,061
Oh, your face.

452
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:51,313
Oh!

453
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:55,233
Is... Do the people... No, I'm kidding.
You're not fired. Yet.

454
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:58,612
Do they not
like me, though?

455
00:20:58,738 --> 00:21:00,322
I don't know, actually. Okay.
