1
00:00:01,055 --> 00:00:03,556
Michael, since it is your fifteenth
anniversary at the company,

2
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:05,933
I thought it might be appropriate
to begin the festivities

3
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:08,936
with a 15-minute
round of applause.

4
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:10,021
I like it.

5
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,191
Followed by a 15-minute
moment of silence.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,901
I don't know.

7
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:16,569
Is it classy enough?

8
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:19,197
Jim, enough with
the classy, okay?

9
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:22,158
I just feel like after 15
years at this company...

10
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:23,284
Bravo, by the way.

11
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,829
That we should celebrate with a very
classy event, a night to remember.

12
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:27,914
I think you're right.

13
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:30,750
This party has to have
all the excitement, drama

14
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:33,044
and intrigue of my time here.

15
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:34,671
And, of course, classy.

16
00:00:34,755 --> 00:00:35,922
And classy, yeah.

17
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:38,675
Michael, you're just agreeing with
him 'cause he's wearing a tux.

18
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,009
Don't you see
what he's doing here?

19
00:00:40,094 --> 00:00:42,553
Last week, Dwight sent out a
memo about the dress code.

20
00:00:42,638 --> 00:00:46,432
So, this is me showing him that
I'm taking it very seriously.

21
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:51,104
Oh! Here's one. A string quartet
playing classical music.

22
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:59,779
You know, that's good, but it's not classy.
I need something

23
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:03,116
classy, like the opening
of a car dealership.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,283
That's it.

25
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,743
Or Mr. Peanut.
Yes.

26
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:07,537
Mr. Peanut is not classy.
He is.

27
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,122
He is a regular peanut.

28
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:11,416
He just happens to have a cane,
a monocle and a top hat.

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,834
That's what
makes him classy.

30
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:14,043
Okay,
how about this?

31
00:01:14,128 --> 00:01:15,712
An ice sculpture
shaped like you

32
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:18,005
covered in chocolate-covered
strawberries.

33
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,134
Dwight, you're trying too hard,
and that's just not classy.

34
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:23,845
See, the thing about classy
is, it's a state of mind.

35
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:26,639
Well, I'm sorry. I just don't
know what classy is, then.

36
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:28,391
Okay, let's just try
this one on for size,

37
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:31,144
and I apologize, 'cause it's
right off the top of my head.

38
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:34,355
An ice sculpture of you
completely surrounded

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,357
by a variety of
chocolate-covered fruits.

40
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:37,567
Strawberries?

41
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:38,651
That's inspired.

42
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:39,902
I said that!

43
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,990
Not classy.

44
00:01:44,074 --> 00:01:45,408
Not classy at all.

45
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:47,285
Déclassé.
French!

46
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:49,287
Classy.

47
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:16,564
Hi, can I help you?

48
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:19,484
Yeah, I'm Charles Miner,
here to see Michael Scott.

49
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:22,487
Sure, just one second,
please. Have a seat.

50
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,239
Yes?
Michael,

51
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:26,491
there's a Charles Miner
here to see you.

52
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:29,535
Miner? I hardly know her!

53
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:32,663
Hello?

54
00:02:32,748 --> 00:02:33,790
Yeah, are you
coming out now?

55
00:02:33,874 --> 00:02:34,874
Uh-huh.

56
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:38,628
Well, well, well,
who have we here?

57
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,255
It is Prince
Charles Miner!

58
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:47,053
At your service. Everybody,
this is Sir Charles Miner,

59
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:50,473
and he is the new VP
for the Northeast region,

60
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:52,642
so just give it up
for this big guy, right?

61
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:53,810
Give it up!

62
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:54,977
Here he is.
There he is.

63
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:56,145
Hey. Hi.

64
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,313
Hi, everyone...

65
00:02:57,397 --> 00:02:58,397
Wow! Hold that thought.

66
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:01,275
You know what? I want everybody
to go into the break room.

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,735
I have a little
surprise for you.

68
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,070
Go ahead. You, too.

69
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:06,489
Dwight, would you escort
our guest in there?

70
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,115
Come on. Here we go.
Don't be shy.

71
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,992
Don't be shy,
you're one of us.

72
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:12,537
Dwight, stall him a little bit.
I have to get the fish.

73
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:13,955
Hey.
Yes?

74
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,500
Really wish you would've told me
the new boss was coming today.

75
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,794
What? No! I didn't want to
make everybody nervous.

76
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:22,380
No, I mean I could've brought
a change of clothes, or...

77
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:23,506
You look dynamite.

78
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,757
What are you
talking about?

79
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:27,468
Very slick. Okay,
let me get the fish.

80
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:30,596
Originally founded in 1866,

81
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:32,765
Scranton quickly became
one of Pennsylvania's

82
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,351
largest anthracite
coalmining communities.

83
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:37,979
Surprise!
There's nothing in here.

84
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:40,231
The real surprise is
in the conference room.

85
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:41,607
Let's go!

86
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:43,776
God! Okay, come on!
Come on!

87
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:47,530
I'll finish it up later, but essentially
what we're talking about is...

88
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,532
Surprise!

89
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:53,911
As you can see,
I turned the bagels

90
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,872
from O's into C's,
for Charles.

91
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,125
Thank you.
Took me all night.

92
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,710
This is what you
did last night?

93
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:02,587
I met this guy at
corporate last week,

94
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:05,756
and we were just
digging each other's vibe.

95
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:08,551
I was totally grooving
on him, and vice versa.

96
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:11,012
And besides, the last two
people to have his job

97
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:12,513
were Jan and Ryan.

98
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:17,518
The former was my lover, and the
latter my best friend, so who knows?

99
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,229
I do.

100
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:22,023
It's gonna be mental!

101
00:04:23,817 --> 00:04:25,818
It's going to be mental.

102
00:04:27,154 --> 00:04:29,989
Oh, my God, he's like
a black George Clooney.

103
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:31,991
Really?
I don't see it.

104
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:36,370
I mean, he's okay. He's
not unattractive, he's...

105
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:37,580
Hey, how you doing?

106
00:04:37,664 --> 00:04:38,748
I'm Jim Halpert,
from sales.

107
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:39,957
Hey.
Just wanted to say,

108
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:42,501
if you need anything,
let me know.

109
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,879
Why are you
wearing a tuxedo?

110
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:47,089
I didn't think you'd notice.

111
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,884
It's funny, actually. There's
another salesman out here,

112
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:52,637
Dwight Schrute, he sent out
this memo, as he always does,

113
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,139
and it was about professionalism
in the workplace,

114
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:56,933
and of course
he singled me out.

115
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:59,226
So I just had
to mess with him.

116
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:02,688
You'd understand if
you read the memo,

117
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:04,065
which I should
probably get you.

118
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,776
There's probably
one in the drawer.

119
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,361
It was pretty crazy.

120
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:09,612
But...

121
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:12,657
Not more crazy than
wearing a tux at work.

122
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:14,951
I'll grant you that,
so I'm gonna...

123
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,702
Your name's Jim?
Jim Halpert, yep,

124
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:19,705
so just gonna let you
get back to it, so...

125
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:22,416
He just had to
wear his tux today.

126
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,584
I thought I'd be funny.

127
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,045
Took him 40 minutes
to get ready.

128
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:31,133
All right, let me introduce
you to some of the troops.

129
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:33,135
Accounting,
front and center.

130
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,055
Come on up here. I'd like
you to meet somebody.

131
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,640
This is
the accounting department.

132
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:39,433
Hey. I come
from accounting, too.

133
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:40,935
Nerd alert!

134
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:45,398
This is Oscar Martinez.
He is Latino,

135
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:50,027
and he just got out of a long-term
relationship with a man, Gil,

136
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:52,989
who broke his heart, but he didn't
bring any of that into work,

137
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:55,241
it did not affect his job
performance whatsoever,

138
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,076
and I am very proud of him

139
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
for that.

140
00:05:58,245 --> 00:05:59,745
Hey, Oscar,
it's good to meet you. Good.

141
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,457
This little hell-raiser
is Angela.

142
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,711
She has slept with a bunch of
different guys in the office.

143
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:09,046
The one over there,
in the orange.

144
00:06:09,131 --> 00:06:10,339
Heyo!

145
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:11,924
Heyo.
Where's the other...

146
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,593
You know, Michael, I don't need to
know everyone's sexual history.

147
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:17,888
Well, perfect, because we
have now arrived at Kevin,

148
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:19,515
and he
has no sexual history.

149
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:20,641
Hey!

150
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:22,935
How about I just say hi
to everyone at one time?

151
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,270
Good! Good, good, good.

152
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:27,314
Everyone please give
it up for Charles Miner.

153
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:31,193
Thank you, Michael. Thank you
for the C-shaped bagels.

154
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:33,696
Well... Above and beyond.
Great. That's great.

155
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,614
Hey, you know,
we're in tough times,

156
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,450
and we're not immune
to this economy.

157
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:38,784
That's true.
But the goal is

158
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:40,661
to, you know, fight
our way through this.

159
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,415
Stanley Hudson. Are there
going to be layoffs?

160
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:45,541
No, absolutely not.

161
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,876
Hold on, Michael,
thank you.

162
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,837
Stanley, you know,
we can't make any promises,

163
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:52,715
but we'll try everything in
our power to avoid that.

164
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,091
Do you have specifics?

165
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:57,428
Well, Michael should have
filled you in last week.

166
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:01,807
Well, due to the economy, there's
a lot of worry going around.

167
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:04,310
I didn't want to worry people. Well...
You didn't tell them.

168
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:05,519
Why don't...

169
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:06,687
Yeah, what I told Michael...

170
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:08,439
Charles is going
to tell you.

171
00:07:08,523 --> 00:07:10,733
is that we are cutting
3% across the board,

172
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:12,860
which means we will
no longer be matching

173
00:07:12,944 --> 00:07:14,737
401 contributions,

174
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:17,156
and all overtime
requests will need

175
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,241
to come through
the corporate office.

176
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:20,868
Fantastic.
Well, it's not official.

177
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:22,578
It is official. It is official...
Well...

178
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:24,872
And actually, guys,
I'm encouraging branches

179
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,416
to consider a freeze
on discretionary spending.

180
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,919
Such as salary benefits,
etcetera, etcetera...

181
00:07:30,003 --> 00:07:31,087
No, no.

182
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:33,089
insurance.
Not salaries.

183
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:37,176
Petty cash, supplies and parties.
Things like that.

184
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Well... No.

185
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:39,553
What about your party?

186
00:07:39,638 --> 00:07:40,763
Okay, okay.
You know what?

187
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:42,473
I think this has been great.

188
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:44,934
I think this gives us a lot
to think about, doesn't it?

189
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:48,020
Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.
He has a long trip home.

190
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:50,064
Thank you for coming in.
We have to get back to work!

191
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,524
Michael, I'm going
to stay for the day.

192
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,858
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

193
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,527
I've got this covered. This
was just a meet and greet.

194
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:56,153
No, this is a little
more involved than that.

195
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:57,530
I'm gonna set up
in here, okay?

196
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:59,824
I am thrilled
that the new boss

197
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:01,826
has taken such
an active interest

198
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,496
in all of the responsibilities
that I'm supposed to have.

199
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:08,374
Thrilled.

200
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:11,877
David,
it was my understanding

201
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:13,963
that I was not
going to be managed.

202
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:16,048
What gave you that idea?

203
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,050
It was my understanding.

204
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:19,135
I see.

205
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:22,638
Listen, why don't we just
leave that position vacant?

206
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:24,557
Truth be told,
I think I thrive

207
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:26,308
under a lack of
accountability.

208
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:29,186
Look, Michael,
Charles is very qualified.

209
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:30,396
Get to know him.

210
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,149
I really think the two of you
are going to make a great team.

211
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:34,483
But the branch is still mine?

212
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:36,318
You're still
the branch manager, yes.

213
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:39,530
And if you need anything else
at all, just let Charles know.

214
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:40,865
Ask him about the party.

215
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:44,326
Right. David, are you coming to
my fifteenth anniversary party?

216
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:45,494
I'll give it my
best shot, Michael.

217
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:46,704
No, no, no,
the other thing.

218
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:49,623
Okay. If we hire Cirque du
Soleil as salaried employees,

219
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,751
will that help us with
the year-end tax stuff?

220
00:08:58,091 --> 00:08:59,717
Think he hung up?

221
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:01,385
No.

222
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:06,390
I just got off the horn with David
Wallace, and he said that you and I

223
00:09:06,474 --> 00:09:09,852
should try to get to know each
other better, and I agree.

224
00:09:09,936 --> 00:09:14,398
So, what I would like you
to do is tell me something

225
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:17,026
that you've never
told anybody before.

226
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,319
No.

227
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:20,946
Come on.
What's your wife's name?

228
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,491
Where did you work
before you came here?

229
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:26,327
Saticoy Steel.

230
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:27,620
Beautiful!

231
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:33,542
See, African-Americans have such
a rich history of unusual names.

232
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:36,795
No, I worked at a company
called Saticoy Steel.

233
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,883
You're not from paper?
No.

234
00:09:40,967 --> 00:09:42,718
Does David know this?
Yeah, he knows.

235
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:45,012
He just wants
a good manager.

236
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:49,391
Well, that actually is
an excellent segue into,

237
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:52,228
really, what is my only point...
Yeah, what is that?

238
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:55,648
and that is, I don't need
to be managed, Charles.

239
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:59,485
And if you want to pick up
some tips observing here

240
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:01,362
and take them to the other
branches, it's all good,

241
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:06,075
but Jan would mostly come by
when she was super horny

242
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,580
and Ryan would come by to visit
his parents and do laundry, so...

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,042
Are we clear?

244
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,419
That's not how I plan
on doing things.

245
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:19,213
Okay, okay.

246
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:20,881
Well, I'll just
bounce that off David.

247
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,007
See what comes back.

248
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:24,802
I'll tell David
what he needs to know.

249
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:27,346
Sorry.
David wants it this way.

250
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:29,098
Whatever David wants.

251
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:30,224
Okay.

252
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,601
Michael Scott
calling for David.

253
00:10:32,686 --> 00:10:37,356
Well, just tell him to call
me ASAP as possible. Thanks.

254
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:41,277
Michael, come on, no.
You have to charm them.

255
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:45,739
David Wallace's office.

256
00:10:45,824 --> 00:10:48,492
Hey there, gorgeous.
How you doing today?

257
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:49,618
I'm good, thank you.

258
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:51,120
How's it hanging?

259
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:52,246
All right.

260
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,415
Good, listen.
My name is Michael

261
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:57,126
Scotch,

262
00:10:57,836 --> 00:10:59,920
and I just wanted to say

263
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:03,882
that I've got David Wallace's
son in the trunk of my car.

264
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,051
If he doesn't get on this
phone in five seconds,

265
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:07,303
I'm gonna start...

266
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:08,721
What are you doing? God!

267
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:12,599
Oh, my God.

268
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:15,019
David Wallace's office.

269
00:11:15,103 --> 00:11:18,314
Hi, Stephanie,
it's Michael Scott again.

270
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,065
I just spoke
with Michael Scotch,

271
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,775
and the son's
going to be returned.

272
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Everything's fine.

273
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:23,944
Michael...

274
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,988
And I really, really
need to talk to David.

275
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:27,448
Please hold.

276
00:11:28,074 --> 00:11:29,575
Charles Miner.

277
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:32,411
Hello? Hello, who is this?

278
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,831
Who is this?

279
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:37,541
I was never given a name.

280
00:11:59,564 --> 00:12:00,731
Hi, can I help you?

281
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:01,940
I don't think anyone here...

282
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:05,861
Pam. Hey, everyone,
lunch is on me today.

283
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Whoa!

284
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:09,365
Wow! That is so unnecessary.

285
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,617
Are you kidding me
with this?

286
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,077
On the day that
I bring in breakfast?

287
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:14,453
Hey, man,
it's no big deal.

288
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:18,415
I wish you had told us sooner,
because I was going to go

289
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,125
to the vending machine
and get an egg salad.

290
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,336
You still have
that option.

291
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:24,505
Thanks again, Charles.
You're welcome.

292
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:25,547
Thank you.

293
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:28,759
Nobody thanked me for
breakfast except Charles.

294
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,555
You say no more parties,

295
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,849
and then you spend all
of this money on lunch.

296
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:37,351
I think it's
a little hypercritical.

297
00:12:37,435 --> 00:12:39,311
I do this for
every branch I go to.

298
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:42,648
If you do not like it, then I
think there are some bagels

299
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:44,858
left over
from this morning.

300
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:49,238
Damn it, Stephanie,
put me through to him.

301
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:52,157
Is that him in the background?
David?

302
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,868
David.
David, pick up the phone.

303
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,205
Should I seduce him?

304
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:01,625
No. No one
wants to see that.

305
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:05,754
Michael.

306
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:06,922
Okay. Yep?

307
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:11,343
I just realized that
I used the 2008 calendar

308
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:13,929
to do the spreadsheets
for January and February.

309
00:13:14,013 --> 00:13:16,265
I may need to come in
this weekend to fix it.

310
00:13:16,349 --> 00:13:17,349
Do some overtime.

311
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:18,475
Want to do some
overtime this weekend?

312
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
You know what, Kevin?

313
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:21,103
I applaud your initiative.

314
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:22,521
Yes, you may.

315
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:24,690
No, sorry, Michael.
No, Kevin, right?

316
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,901
Gonna need you to do that
during office hours.

317
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:29,611
Okay.
Okay. Thank you.

318
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:32,239
Kevin, this is my branch.

319
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:34,199
You don't ask Charles.
You ask me.

320
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:35,451
I say approved.

321
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:36,785
That's not the way
it's gonna work.

322
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,912
Yes, it is.
No, it is not.

323
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,039
No, it is not.

324
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,499
Okay, so we're on
the same page, great.

325
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:43,959
Okay, so we're on
the same page, great!

326
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:45,127
Okay, Michael.
No, seriously.

327
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:46,503
Okay, Michael.
No, seriously.

328
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:47,921
How old are you?
How old are you?

329
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:48,964
Oh, no.

330
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:52,134
I can tell Michael's mood by which
comedy routine he chooses to do.

331
00:13:52,218 --> 00:13:54,470
The more infantile,
the more upset he is.

332
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:57,473
And he just skipped the Ace
Ventura talking-butt thing.

333
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:59,057
He never skips it.

334
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:00,893
This is bad.

335
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,644
Five years old.
Five years old.

336
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:04,146
Dude, stop.

337
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,939
Michael!
This is great.

338
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,149
- Michael, stop doing that!
- This is great.

339
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,192
- ... a whole mess of trouble.
- Stop it!

340
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:09,276
I'm going to walk away.

341
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,611
I'm going to walk away.

342
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:11,737
Stop doing that!

343
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:14,948
I'm kidding around.
Wow! Relax, everybody.

344
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,159
It's just a joke.
It's fine.

345
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:20,871
Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's
continue our morning meeting

346
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:22,247
in the conference room.

347
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:26,543
And then out of that cake pops another
stripper holding a smaller cake,

348
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:29,505
and then an even smaller
stripper pops out of that one.

349
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:31,340
What is that
smaller stripper holding?

350
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:32,549
A cupcake.
Nice.

351
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:34,343
It's cupcakes and strippers
all the way down.

352
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:35,552
Okay.

353
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:38,138
What exactly is the PPC?

354
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,892
That's the Party
Planning Committee.

355
00:14:41,976 --> 00:14:44,436
They spend hours
planning parties.

356
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:46,438
Excuse me, guys.

357
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:48,899
What's going on in here?
Party Planning Committee.

358
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:50,275
Not your concern, Charles.

359
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,028
This doesn't seem like a good
way to spend company time.

360
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:55,239
Really? Well, then,
how would we come up

361
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:58,116
with great ideas
like Jim's? Go ahead.

362
00:14:58,243 --> 00:14:59,701
No, I would like to get
back to work, actually.

363
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:01,912
- Please.
- What you got, Jim?

364
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,123
What is
a two-way petting zoo?

365
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:09,795
You pet the animals,
they pet you back.

366
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:12,005
It's a great idea.
And we have a cake

367
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,007
in the shape of
a bale of hay.

368
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,592
It's really just
a regular-shaped cake...

369
00:15:15,677 --> 00:15:17,094
- But it's cool, and it's...
- No.

370
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:19,388
This isn't a good use
of company time, Michael.

371
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:22,724
Whoa. You're talking about
my anniversary party, so...

372
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:25,519
Okay, everyone except for
Michael, go back to your desks.

373
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:27,229
Thank you very much. Yeah,
why don't you do that?

374
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:29,356
Yeah, here we go. Okay.
Okay.

375
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,985
Okay, Michael, I'm
dissolving this committee.

376
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:34,570
What?
Yeah, I mean, come on!

377
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:37,489
This is a workplace. It isn't
designed for your vanity.

378
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:40,576
Newsflash. I've been
here for 15 years.

379
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:43,245
Headline. You have
been here one day.

380
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:44,705
End of story.

381
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:48,834
You have no right to cancel my
fifteenth anniversary party.

382
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,044
End of story. End of story!
End of story!

383
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:52,462
I don't care
if I've hurt your feelings

384
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:55,799
or you do not agree with my
methods, but it is over.

385
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:59,344
Okay, no, no, no, you know what?
I'm going to New York,

386
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:02,097
and I am going to talk
to David Wallace.

387
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:04,057
I'm going to
tell him everything,

388
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:06,393
and I'm sorry to say,
you're screwed.

389
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:08,061
And you know what?

390
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:10,689
You are gonna be through.

391
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:13,317
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry
to do that to you.

392
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:14,610
Right.

393
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:16,528
Do you even know
how paper is made?

394
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,697
It's not like steel.

395
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:20,907
You don't put it
into a furnace!

396
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,953
If you put paper into a furnace,
you know what would happen?

397
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:26,705
You'd ruin it!

398
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:38,884
Come in.

399
00:16:39,385 --> 00:16:40,636
Hey!
Hey.

400
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,304
All right, Charles,
I gotta be honest.

401
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:45,474
I think we really got off
on the wrong foot here,

402
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:49,895
and, truth be told, I'm a pretty
smart guy and a hard worker

403
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:51,647
and I'm a great
number two for the office.

404
00:16:51,731 --> 00:16:52,814
Number two?

405
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:55,025
Second-in-command
to Michael.

406
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:57,694
I didn't know that
position existed.

407
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:00,405
That's because at first it was
a made-up position for Dwight,

408
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,490
just to make him feel better.

409
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:03,241
Assistant to
the Regional Manager.

410
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,160
But then he lost that,
and Michael gave it to me.

411
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:07,954
So you're the Assistant
to the Regional Manager?

412
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,414
Assistant
Regional Manager, yeah.

413
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:12,250
Any responsibilities
come with it?

414
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
No, not exactly.

415
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:17,881
Do you want to keep
this made-up position?

416
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:20,592
It's important to you?

417
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,638
All right, I will...

418
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:26,807
I'm just going to let you get back to it.
Yeah, would you...

419
00:17:26,891 --> 00:17:28,350
Yep.
Thanks.

420
00:17:34,607 --> 00:17:37,150
Hello, Stephanie.
Okay, where is he?

421
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:40,654
Michael.

422
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:45,283
So is this the meeting
you've been in all day?

423
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:46,451
How did you get here,
Michael?

424
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:48,120
I drove.

425
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:50,831
Okay.

426
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:54,000
Cancelled my fifteenth
anniversary party.

427
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:55,836
Just pulled the rug
out from under me.

428
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,880
He said no figs.
I've already bought them,

429
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:00,841
and I don't have
a place to store them.

430
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,719
So I feel like
I've been sort of boned.

431
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:05,679
Michael... Did you talk
to him about this?

432
00:18:05,763 --> 00:18:08,014
You've talked to him
all day, obviously.

433
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,558
Did you talk to him
about this?

434
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,560
Well, I didn't know about
the figs specifically...

435
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:12,811
No, okay,
then I don't get it.

436
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:14,187
It doesn't make
any sense to me,

437
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:15,439
because I thought
the new system was

438
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:17,566
that I was supposed
to talk to Charles,

439
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,234
and then Charles was
supposed to talk to you,

440
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:21,528
and that would dilute
any need for me

441
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:22,863
to ever talk to you again.

442
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:24,030
That's not
exactly the system...

443
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:25,907
Clearly that's
what you wanted.

444
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:26,992
No...

445
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:28,493
Fifteen years
I've been here,

446
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:30,829
and I have sacrificed a lot.

447
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:32,706
Yes.

448
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,332
I've put having
a family on hold.

449
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,376
We didn't ask you to do that.

450
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:38,754
And I have never
gone hang-gliding.

451
00:18:38,838 --> 00:18:42,591
And I've never driven my car to
the top of Mount Washington.

452
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,844
Okay.

453
00:18:45,928 --> 00:18:47,637
- Nice meeting everyone.
- All right.

454
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:49,556
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Cool.

455
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,974
Excellent.

456
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,811
It was very nice meeting
you, Charles Miner.

457
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:57,522
Okay.

458
00:18:58,232 --> 00:18:59,524
See you.

459
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:03,570
See you!

460
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:06,490
Bye!

461
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:13,830
And for my next trick, I will
make my career disappear.

462
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:16,541
I could see our kids
facing obstacles,

463
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,418
being half black
and half Indian,

464
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,796
but it's so worth it,
you guys.

465
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,881
There's just me here.

466
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:25,467
I am going to get him to buy
me a prime rib tonight.

467
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:27,469
I think he left.
What?

468
00:19:29,138 --> 00:19:30,222
Move!

469
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:33,767
Hello? Charles?

470
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,560
Charles?

471
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:36,895
Hey!

472
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,523
Is that his scarf?

473
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:41,483
No!

474
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,029
Charles and Kelly?
Absolutely not.

475
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:48,740
He is a sophisticated man.

476
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,161
He does not need to go dumpster-diving
for companionship, okay?

477
00:19:54,455 --> 00:19:59,709
I don't understand that, after
15 years of service here,

478
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,880
I have to get in a car and drive to
New York in order to talk to you.

479
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:05,841
That doesn't
seem right to me.

480
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:08,552
That doesn't seem fair,
and I think

481
00:20:09,971 --> 00:20:12,305
that I've earned
more than that.

482
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:17,310
Yep.

483
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,898
You're right, yes. I get it.
I get it, Michael.

484
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,942
Okay.
Here's what I'm gonna do.

485
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:25,026
Okay.

486
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,445
We will move
some money around,

487
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:31,408
and I will personally see to
it that you have your party,

488
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:34,870
you have your figs.
I will be in attendance.

489
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:37,289
It's gonna be great.
How's that?

490
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:44,713
I quit.

491
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:45,922
What?

492
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:51,219
Michael. You have no
idea how high I can fly.
