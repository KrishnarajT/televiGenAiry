1
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,612
It's Britney, bitch,
and I am back

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,656
in the form of
a new company,

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,158
the Michael Scott
Paper Company.

4
00:00:32,543 --> 00:00:33,835
Okay.

5
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:35,420
Not going to make this one.

6
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:43,094
Love the hair.

7
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:47,974
- Morning, Michael.
- Hello.

8
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,561
They took away
my parking space,

9
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:53,354
but they can't
take away my pride.

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,990
I would like to invite you all to
come along with me on a journey.

11
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,208
Welcome

12
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,795
to the Michael Scott
Paper Company.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,753
So, I thought we could
take the customer list

14
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,213
and...

15
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:03,257
And we could...

16
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:05,802
You realize you're not
actually talking to me, right?

17
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:06,928
And...

18
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:08,471
Hey, Kelly.

19
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,516
Yes, Charles,
you wanted me.

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,893
Oh. No, I meant
that Kelly.

21
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:16,604
The new receptionist
is also named Kelly.

22
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:19,440
So Kelly Kapoor has decided
to hover around my desk

23
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:21,150
so that she can run
into Charles' office

24
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:22,610
every time
he calls for Kelly.

25
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,655
She thinks that if she says
"You wanted me" enough,

26
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,573
he will, in fact,
want her.

27
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,326
It's not the worst plan
she's ever had.

28
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:31,828
Oh, and Kelly...

29
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:34,372
Yes, Charles,
yes, you wanted me.

30
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:37,667
Okay, I'm going
to call you Kapoor,

31
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,418
okay, and you Hammond.

32
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:42,880
If we're changing names, can I be Erin?
It's my middle name.

33
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:45,049
Erin? Okay,
that's very pretty.

34
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,217
Thanks.

35
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,343
Well, you know what
my middle name is?

36
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:50,137
Rajnigandha. And I hate it.
I hate it!

37
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,309
I thought Rajnigandha
was a boy's name.

38
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:06,445
We are in the heart of it.

39
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:11,868
And the surge of water carries
our business out to the sea.

40
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,202
What should we do now?

41
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:18,040
We wait and hope that people
show up to the pancake luncheon.

42
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,876
I don't know. I think
I have done absolutely

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,295
everything you can do
to prepare for the day.

44
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,380
I've updated
our contacts,

45
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:26,465
I have gotten quotes
from suppliers,

46
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,010
I have sent out an Evite

47
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:31,846
for our big grand opening
pancake luncheon.

48
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:35,474
Six yeses, one maybe,
only 11 nos.

49
00:03:37,102 --> 00:03:39,729
And 788 not-yet-replieds,

50
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:43,482
but of that group,
782 have viewed it.

51
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:49,572
I'm going to need
800 of these

52
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,241
on nice bright paper.

53
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:55,494
It is a coupon for
unparalleled customer service.

54
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:06,672
I make that one copy and I become
the girl who makes copies.

55
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:09,967
And by the end of the day,
I'm receptionist again.

56
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:12,803
And the worst part is
I like making copies.

57
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:15,848
The paper comes out
all warm and stuff.

58
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:19,185
And it's cold in there, because
it's technically a closet.

59
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:28,027
What do you think?

60
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:29,320
Let me check.

61
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:33,074
No! Clearly a hunter,

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,952
who knows how to throw an
outfit together. Thank you.

63
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:38,371
Yes, I am taking Andy
hunting after work.

64
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:41,123
Not long ago we were
sexual competitors.

65
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,876
I used to hate him, hate
him, hate him, hate him.

66
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:47,338
I studied him to figure out
why I hated him so much.

67
00:04:47,923 --> 00:04:52,385
But that blossomed into a very real
friendship, as these things often do.

68
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,513
You should come in town
this weekend, man. Yeah.

69
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,223
We'll hang out Scranton-style.
Hey.

70
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:59,058
You said you were going to
be out of town this weekend.

71
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,185
Please don't listen
to my phone calls.

72
00:05:02,938 --> 00:05:04,563
Yeah, she's, like...

73
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,068
She'd probably be a six in New York, but
she's like a seven here in Scranton.

74
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:11,487
And then the boss is my old
boss from Dunder Mifflin.

75
00:05:13,782 --> 00:05:14,991
It's a small space.

76
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,201
Hey, Jim,
can I get a, um...

77
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:19,245
Hi.
Hi.

78
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:21,831
I need a rundown of your clients.
Can you get that to me?

79
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:22,873
Sure.
Yeah?

80
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,375
Yeah.
Okay.

81
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:28,504
What the hell
is a rundown?

82
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:32,466
When did you need
that rundown by?

83
00:05:32,551 --> 00:05:33,926
Soon as possible.
Okay.

84
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:37,096
Just get it right.
Yeah, gotcha. Of course.

85
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:39,849
Really dive into
the rundown.

86
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,018
I'll be exhausted, because
it's like a triathlon.

87
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:44,270
Did you want
to close this?

88
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,813
Keep it...

89
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,156
You know there's a ghost
in this office.

90
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:57,575
Really? A woman was
murdered on this very floor

91
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,160
in 1816.

92
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:01,829
Haddy McGonigal.
She was a prostitute.

93
00:06:02,456 --> 00:06:04,373
Why was she
in this building?

94
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,001
This whole place
used to be a brothel.

95
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,919
There was a tavern
on the ground floor.

96
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:11,380
That's crazy.
Yeah, isn't it?

97
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:14,467
She was bludgeoned to death by the
business end of a riding crop.

98
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,677
Oh, my God.
It was gruesome.

99
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,306
They say she walks
these hallways.

100
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:22,975
If you ever feel a tapping
on your shoulder,

101
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,477
that could be Haddy,

102
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,353
begging for her life.

103
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:29,315
And it could mean
that you're next.

104
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:36,405
Just kidding.
You finding everything okay?

105
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,407
Yeah. Just got some ice.
Yeah.

106
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:42,995
Erin. Erin.

107
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,997
Oh. This is awkward.

108
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,001
Uh-oh.

109
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:50,628
Oh.

110
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:51,837
Oh!

111
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:56,300
So, I'll see you
guys around.

112
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:05,309
Hey, buddy.

113
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:12,691
Hey, Ryan, could you get
to that copy from before?

114
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:14,276
Pam's better
at that stuff.

115
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,694
That is so insulting.

116
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,197
How is it insulting to say
that you're good at something?

117
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:19,698
Because the thing
you're saying I'm good at

118
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:22,034
is pushing a big green
button a bunch of times.

119
00:07:22,202 --> 00:07:24,620
I'm not judging it.
It's like,

120
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:28,040
I could run GM,
but I couldn't fix a car.

121
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,292
It's not saying that
one's better than the other.

122
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:33,963
Seriously? Because it sounds like one
of those is better than the other.

123
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:35,965
What the hell?

124
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,758
Listen, listen, listen!

125
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:40,302
I need somebody to make
a copy of this,

126
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:42,263
because I don't make
copies, I'm the boss.

127
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:43,472
Got it?

128
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,433
I make originals.
Yeah, I make originals, too.

129
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:49,311
Shut up! Stop it, stop it!
Bickering, stop it!

130
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:51,772
Really.
Yeah.

131
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:54,942
Not much.
What's up with you?

132
00:07:55,402 --> 00:07:57,903
No, it's okay,
I'm in the bathroom.

133
00:07:58,196 --> 00:08:02,074
Hey, you been watching Damages this year?
It's been so good.

134
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:06,078
No, you gotta tune in. It's
as good as anything on HBO.

135
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,250
Hey, does blue
go with tan?

136
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:12,710
Would somebody
just make the copy?

137
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:16,255
Like a blue shirt.
I don't wear a lot of colors.

138
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,673
I have a lot of tan.

139
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,342
Uh-huh.

140
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,511
Just make the copy, okay?

141
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:36,525
Seriously? This is
what's so important.

142
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,027
Putting naked pictures
on the desktop.

143
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:39,862
That's me and my friend
Jasmine from Thailand.

144
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:41,989
I don't want to look at your
friend Jasmine's boobs all day.

145
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:45,242
You could be hot, too, if
you made any effort at all.

146
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,161
Like how?
Dying my hair blond?

147
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,872
This is from the sun.
Oh, yeah, I bet.

148
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:53,042
They're getting on my nerves, Mom.
Both of them.

149
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,543
R thinks he's too good
to be here

150
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,921
and P is not as much fun
without Jim.

151
00:08:57,005 --> 00:08:58,047
Michael, we can hear you.

152
00:08:58,131 --> 00:08:59,965
I'm on the phone, please.

153
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:04,595
Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back.
P's being a giant B.

154
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:06,597
Okay, it's my turn.

155
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,015
No, don't take that,
give that back.

156
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:09,058
Go make the copies.
Give it back for what?

157
00:09:09,142 --> 00:09:10,184
What are you going
to do with it?

158
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,518
You're gonna make
another spreadsheet.

159
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:14,355
Yeah, exactly, it's my turn, come on!
Go make the copies, secretary.

160
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:17,316
Ryan! They always say
that it is a mistake

161
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,944
to hire your friends
and they are right.

162
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,738
So, I hired
my best friends.

163
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:24,698
And this is what I get?

164
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:28,744
Hey, buddy.
What are you up to?

165
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:31,205
Hmm. Nothing.

166
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,626
Listen, when I saw you
talking to Erin earlier,

167
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:39,088
I noticed that your pupils
dilated and your skin flushed,

168
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:43,133
and I'm assuming a little bit of
blood rushed into your penis.

169
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:51,016
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into
mine as well, so where does that leave us?

170
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:57,106
The last thing I want to do
is step on your funk, man.

171
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,068
And I yours,
so I will cede her to you.

172
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:03,612
No, that's ridiculous.
No, no, no.

173
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:05,739
Look, you've been here
longer and, besides,

174
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:07,866
I'm a better wingman
than I am a boyfriend,

175
00:10:07,993 --> 00:10:10,035
so... But I just want
you and I to hang out.

176
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,787
You know, just...

177
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,373
Boom.

178
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,042
Listen up.

179
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:24,466
It has come to my attention

180
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:26,176
that some people
in this office

181
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:29,847
are not getting along with
other people in this office.

182
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,391
And I think I have come up
with the reason why.

183
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:35,728
This office space
is too small.

184
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,354
Definitely.
Okay.

185
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,317
There are four corners
in this room.

186
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:45,946
Each corner is to be a personal
space for each one of you.

187
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:49,199
Whichever corner you want,
and make it your own.

188
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:50,492
We could work from home.

189
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:52,453
Or you could fire
one of us.

190
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,954
Whoever has
less education.

191
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,165
Okay, guys,
thank you for the offers,

192
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,125
but I want you to get pumped
about this corner idea.

193
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,503
All right, one, two, three,
what are we going to do?

194
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,881
Corner idea.
No, you're supposed to say,

195
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:05,382
"Rock the house."
Rock the house.

196
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:06,592
How would we know that?

197
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:10,304
Hey, dude, do you know
what a rundown is?

198
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,098
Use it in a sentence.

199
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:14,266
Uh...

200
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:16,685
Can you get this
rundown for me?

201
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,228
Try another sentence.

202
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:20,064
This rundown better
be really good.

203
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,358
I don't know, but it sounds like
the rundown is really important.

204
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:24,610
Charles asked me to do this
rundown of all my clients.

205
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:26,236
Why don't you just
ask him what it...

206
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,280
No, I can't,
that was like hours ago.

207
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:29,948
What have you been doing?

208
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,867
Try another sentence.

209
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,703
Last night
was crazy.

210
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,997
Jojo? Yeah.

211
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:39,875
He did a doughnut in the
parking lot in front of a cop.

212
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,418
Then he yells, "Hey, cop,
you like doughnuts?"

213
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:43,087
And we drive off.

214
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:45,214
No, he just
stayed there.

215
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:47,925
I want that new phone.

216
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,177
No, the other one.

217
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:52,429
No, the other one. No, you know
which one I'm talking about.

218
00:11:52,514 --> 00:11:54,056
It's the one...

219
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:55,641
No, the one with
the awesome browser.

220
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,145
That's my corner.

221
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:01,772
I thought that
was your corner.

222
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,066
No, this is where I work.

223
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:06,735
I can't relax in the
same corner where I work.

224
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,197
So my corner's the one
with the copier?

225
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:13,033
Pam, I don't make
the rules.

226
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:20,999
I wish my iPod
could make phone calls.

227
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,877
No, I don't want an iPhone.
I know what an iPhone is.

228
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,136
You started on that
rundown yet?

229
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,766
Oh, this is just something
I'm taking a break with. Oh.

230
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:40,602
I will get back to
the rundown right now.

231
00:12:40,728 --> 00:12:42,521
Okay, great.
Hey, you know what?

232
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:44,148
Do you have a rundown
that I could take a look at,

233
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:46,567
just so I know what type of
rundown you're looking for?

234
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,652
Just keep it simple. Keeping it
simple, that's what I'm doing.

235
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,362
But I am working
hard on this one.

236
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:52,739
Real hard, so...
You're working hard? On this?

237
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:56,577
No, not too hard,
not harder than I should.

238
00:12:56,995 --> 00:12:59,288
Right, I mean, why work
harder than you should?

239
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,040
No, I...

240
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:10,424
Can I help you?
No, thanks.

241
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:11,967
Hey. Hey, I'm here
to see Charles.

242
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:13,177
Okay.

243
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,637
Hey, Charles.
Hey, Pam.

244
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:18,432
I know you're a very busy man,
so I'll cut right to the chase.

245
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:20,893
Okay.
I'd like my old job back.

246
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,020
I don't know what to tell you.
The job's been taken.

247
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:29,234
Well, I could come back as a salesman.
I have experience now.

248
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,488
Or I could come back
as your personal assistant.

249
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:34,490
You know, sort your mail,
set your appointments.

250
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:36,617
I know all the people.
Yeah, no.

251
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:38,660
Personal shopper?

252
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:39,912
No.

253
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:43,415
Well, it was great
catching up with you,

254
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,666
and I'll see you
around the building.

255
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:45,751
Okay.

256
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:50,464
I'm just going to sit here for a
little bit longer if that's okay.

257
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:53,383
The air smells so good.

258
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,178
I don't remember it
smelling so good.

259
00:13:57,013 --> 00:13:59,056
Chairs are so comfortable.

260
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:07,940
Oh, hey, Stanley,
Phyllis, come on in.

261
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,776
Welcome, welcome.
Let me give you the tour.

262
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,195
I get it.
You need to see more?

263
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,446
It's really cute.

264
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:16,281
Thank you.
Do you remember Ryan?

265
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:21,411
And Pam,
around here somewhere.

266
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:23,580
She's upstairs
talking to Charles.

267
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,959
What for?
I don't know.

268
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,587
Are we staying
until 5:00?

269
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:32,047
Yes.

270
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:38,011
Maybe the Michael Scott Paper
Company was a huge mistake.

271
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:42,766
I should leave.
I should go

272
00:14:42,892 --> 00:14:46,228
and start my own paper company.
That'll show them.

273
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:52,651
Get your free pancakes.

274
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:56,321
They are delicious.
They are nutritious.

275
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:58,907
They are complimentary.

276
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:00,826
Young sir, would you
like a free pancake?

277
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,578
I'm texting. I don't want
to get my hands sticky.

278
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:06,081
Ryan, enough with the texting machine.
Come on.

279
00:15:06,207 --> 00:15:08,500
Tuck in your shirt. You're
the face of this company.

280
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,256
Hey, Pam.
Hey.

281
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,425
You sort of disappeared there for a while.
Where you been?

282
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,760
Yeah, I needed to take
care of some stuff. Yeah?

283
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:20,512
That's as specific
as I'd like to be.

284
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:23,515
Well, at least you're still
being honest with me.

285
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,980
There's the rundown
you asked for.

286
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:32,232
I may have expanded some areas
that you weren't prepared for...

287
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:34,943
Great, fax that to everyone
on the distribution list.

288
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:37,195
Uh, sure.

289
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:40,657
Do you want to look at it first?
Do I need to?

290
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,951
No. No, I just...

291
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:47,914
Wanted to make sure
we have the same format.

292
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,794
So that distribution list
is going to be my...

293
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,964
What's that? The one I have.
I'll use the one I have.

294
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:03,639
Just faxing my dad a rundown.

295
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:08,060
We're small, but we're eager
to make a name for ourselves.

296
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,520
Do you have a card?

297
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:14,608
No, I don't have a card,
but I'll do you one better.

298
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:16,818
A little scrap of paper.

299
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:21,490
These are terrible, boss.

300
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:24,326
You got to make them in a circle,
so that they cook evenly.

301
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,661
They're shaped
like paper.

302
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,579
Well, I don't even
want these.

303
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:32,584
I'll take them
for my kid.

304
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:46,098
Country roads,
take me home

305
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:47,599
To the place...

306
00:16:47,684 --> 00:16:50,268
Sorry, I like that song.
You're good.

307
00:16:50,937 --> 00:16:52,354
You're good.
Thank you.

308
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:54,981
That was great,
but it's just sort of...

309
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,651
It's still a little choppy, like...
But don't worry, it's hard, I mean,

310
00:16:57,735 --> 00:16:59,194
it took me a while, too.
It's like...

311
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:07,619
Wow.

312
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,079
What?

313
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,206
Oh, my God, you heard that?
I'm so embarrassed.

314
00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:13,667
I'm so, like, rusty. It's good,
you're really coming along.

315
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,085
It's really technically
proficient,

316
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:17,379
but, you know, there's really
no heart or soul in it.

317
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:18,630
Really?

318
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,603
Hey, do you want
to sing it with me?

319
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:35,814
Almost heaven

320
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,024
West Virginia
West Virginia

321
00:17:38,234 --> 00:17:41,945
Blue Ridge Mountains
Shenandoah River

322
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,155
In German!

323
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:55,834
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads

324
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:00,297
To the place I belong
To the place I belong

325
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:04,509
West Virginia, mountain momma
West Virginia, mountain momma

326
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:08,555
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads

327
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,140
Take it, Andy!

328
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:14,686
Take me home to the place

329
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:21,026
You have to stop.

330
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:34,414
I once had a dream

331
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:38,502
that I was eating a peanut
butter and tuna fish sandwich,

332
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,505
and let me tell you
something, it was delicious.

333
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:45,258
So, the next day, I decided
to make that sandwich.

334
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:48,303
And in real life
it is disgusting.

335
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:51,139
It is a disgusting sandwich.

336
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:54,184
And the reason
I tell you this story...

337
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,145
Pick up the phone. Just...

338
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,984
Dunder... Michael Scott
Paper Company, this is Pam.

339
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,614
Oh. Hi, Russell from the
pancake luncheon, how are you?

340
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:11,910
Well, we'd like to do
business with you, too.

341
00:19:11,994 --> 00:19:14,079
How can I make that happen?

342
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:17,374
Keep going. Tell him
we have free delivery.

343
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,750
We already offer
free delivery.

344
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:20,335
They don't know that.

345
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:24,798
I can offer you free delivery on
any order that you place today.

346
00:19:24,882 --> 00:19:25,924
God.

347
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:31,304
Okay, 20 boxes, I can do...
Just a second.

348
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,559
I can do 20 boxes
at $43 a box.

349
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:38,562
Great.

350
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:40,355
Write it down.

351
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,523
Give him a guarantee.

352
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,441
A guarantee of what?
Just say the word.

353
00:19:43,526 --> 00:19:48,029
And I guarantee that
you will be satisfied,

354
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:52,158
because your satisfaction
is our guarantee.

355
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:53,952
We guarantee it.

356
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:56,580
We look forward to doing
business with you, too.

357
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:57,706
Thank you, Russell.

358
00:19:58,082 --> 00:19:59,374
Yes!
I made a sale!

359
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,459
You did! Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God.

360
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:03,628
We did it!
She did it! Yeah!

361
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:06,006
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

362
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:07,799
Who would have thought
that the thing that

363
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:10,802
would save this company
would be work?

364
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:11,887
And pancakes.

365
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:16,892
In the end, this day definitely
had its ups and downs.

366
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:20,020
I realize that we don't
have the biggest office,

367
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:24,190
which is a surprise, because 165
square feet sounds like a lot.

368
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:27,944
But we have people
with the biggest hearts,

369
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,280
and I think
for a small company,

370
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:31,573
that is really...

371
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,619
Someone went
to the bathroom.

372
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:40,790
That is really
what's important.

373
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:46,421
Literally every song is better a cappella.
Name a song.

374
00:20:46,505 --> 00:20:48,340
Cherry Pie, Warrant.
Better a cappella.

375
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:50,842
No, really?
Yeah, name another.

376
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:54,179
Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Better a cappella.

377
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:56,014
Rebel Yell, Billy Idol.

378
00:20:56,098 --> 00:20:57,891
Way better a cappella.

379
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:59,643
Really?
Yeah.
