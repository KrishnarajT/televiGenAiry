1
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:04,505
Hey, sport!

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,466
I heard someone
got engaged, you dog!

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,675
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:09,636
God!

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,095
Nothing can
hurt you now.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,805
You're a man in love!

7
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:19,395
I was there, and that
dude is not engaged.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,397
I'm not a big believer
in therapy,

9
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:23,900
but I would go into my own
pocket to cover his copay.

10
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:26,152
Big idea,
double wedding!

11
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,487
Me, Angela, you, Holly.

12
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:28,946
No. We would never do that.

13
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:30,657
And if we did, it would
be with Jim and Pam.

14
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:31,741
Yeah, we'd never
do that.

15
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:32,825
Yeah, so there you go.

16
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,661
Michael, I got
my bridesmaid's dress.

17
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:35,870
Wow, so quickly.

18
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:36,996
Yeah, and you said
I could get it

19
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,748
in any color I wanted,
so I picked white.

20
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:41,334
Michael, did you tell
your mom yet?

21
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:43,169
Nope. Nope, not yet.

22
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:44,504
Why not?
You wouldn't tell your mom?

23
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,089
- You love your mom.
- Yeah, I do.

24
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:47,173
Call your mom, Michael.

25
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:49,467
Yeah, I'll call her
and tell her tomorrow.

26
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:53,680
Call her! Call her! I don't
wanna do it in public.

27
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:55,848
All right,
I will call her.

28
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,600
She is going to
freak out!

29
00:00:57,685 --> 00:00:58,685
Speakerphone!

30
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,811
Not...

31
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:03,022
Thanks.

32
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:04,065
Hello?

33
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,400
Mom, I'm getting married.

34
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:06,484
No, you're not.

35
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:08,319
Why do you always do that?

36
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:12,657
Whenever I'm getting married,
you don't believe me.

37
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,451
Are you getting married?

38
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:16,828
No.

39
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:20,039
Are you...

40
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:22,083
I'm not.
I'm not getting married.

41
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:29,215
Psych.

42
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:53,406
So I've returned
my bridesmaid dress

43
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,659
and it was on sale, so I'm
out a hundred dollars.

44
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:58,995
And I'm out a fiancÃ©e.

45
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:00,747
Are those
the customer surveys?

46
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:04,584
Yeah, this is all of them.
Jim, Dwight,

47
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:08,421
Phyllis, Stanley,
Andy and...

48
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,883
It's the receipt
to my bridesmaid dress.

49
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:12,967
What's that doing there?

50
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:16,387
I'll take care of that
for you. Thanks.

51
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:22,435
Kelly Kapoor is our dusky,
exotic, customer service rep.

52
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:25,605
And once a year, she
will contact our clients

53
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:28,858
and find out how happy they
are with our sales people.

54
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:32,111
Sort of a "Kapoor's List."
Schindler's List parody.

55
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,365
That's not appropriate. No.

56
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,035
Those reports
affect our bonuses,

57
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:40,828
which is kind of
great for me,

58
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:43,581
because you wouldn't know
from looking at her,

59
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:44,957
but Pam's a gold digger.

60
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:47,960
- Hey, New York ain't free.
- Get back to work.

61
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:52,298
It's the world's
tiniest Bluetooth.

62
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:55,301
I found it in a Japanese
gadget store in the Village.

63
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,178
I got one for Jim, too.

64
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,304
Jim, say something.

65
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,014
Testing, testing,
hello, everybody.

66
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:01,516
We wanted to stay
on the phone all day,

67
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,685
but the company has a policy
against eight-hour personal calls,

68
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,687
so we're not
telling anyone.

69
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:08,815
Pam, what do you
want on your coffee?

70
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:11,317
- Sprinkle of cinnamon.
- Sprinkle of cinnamon.

71
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:12,527
I should go.

72
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:15,321
All righty, Dwighty,
let's see how you did.

73
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:17,031
Bring it on.
No.

74
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,282
Sorry.

75
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,117
Wow.

76
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:21,244
What does it say?

77
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,623
Dwight, your feedback
is horrible.

78
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,583
That's impossible.
A number of your clients

79
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:30,503
found your personal style
abrasive and distasteful.

80
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,672
I sell more paper than anyone.
No, no, no, no.

81
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:34,423
Wait, is this a joke?

82
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:36,676
I'm getting that queasy feeling
that sometimes accompanies jokes.

83
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,094
Do I look like
I am joking?

84
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:40,471
No, but that's
sometimes part of it.

85
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,056
If I were joking,
you'd be laughing.

86
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,808
Do you look like
you are laughing?

87
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:46,143
Impossible to say,
I can't see myself.

88
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:47,270
You're not.

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,106
Yo, Tommy Tuna.

90
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,566
Did you get
your scores yet?

91
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,775
No.

92
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:54,819
I got mine,
they were really good.

93
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:56,153
I miss him.

94
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:57,488
You must be really proud.

95
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,365
Yeah, I'm pretty psyched.
Whoa!

96
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:00,950
That's my mug.

97
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:04,078
Sorry, I was just...
It was right here.

98
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:05,204
Right. Well,

99
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:08,499
it's mine, so if you could pour
it out and get another one.

100
00:04:08,584 --> 00:04:10,918
Okay, or maybe I could finish
the coffee that's in here,

101
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,962
and you could use...

102
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:15,298
Snoopy! He's funny.

103
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:17,091
Don't give him Snoopy.
That's mine!

104
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,221
That is a great mug,
but it's not my mug.

105
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,558
That is my mug,
so give it back.

106
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:27,393
How can you even be sure?

107
00:04:27,477 --> 00:04:29,645
That's my face on it.

108
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:31,355
Make the face.

109
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:33,107
I don't see it.

110
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:34,817
Dude, that is my face.

111
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,486
What was that?

112
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:39,530
Wow. That was Dwight.

113
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:40,990
He seems upset
about something.

114
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:42,408
Describe him exactly.

115
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:45,077
What color mustard is his
shirt, yellow or Dijon?

116
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:47,914
It is spicy brown, actually.

117
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:49,248
What are you
mumbling about?

118
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,458
How was your meeting
with Michael?

119
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:51,626
None of your business.

120
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,710
Was it your scores?

121
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,004
These can't be
my scores, Jim.

122
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:58,549
For your information,
I'm being sabotaged.

123
00:04:58,634 --> 00:04:59,634
Of course.

124
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,761
And I'm gonna find that
person and punish them.

125
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:02,803
Absolutely.

126
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:05,348
Or you could just be
nice to your customers.

127
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:06,891
You're an idiot.

128
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:08,142
There's the charm.

129
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:10,353
Jimbo, let's do this thing.

130
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:12,813
That is me.
Wish me luck.

131
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:13,940
No way.

132
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:15,232
Good luck.
Thanks.

133
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:16,734
I didn't say anything.
I love you.

134
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:17,777
I love you, too.

135
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:20,321
What do you think
I'm saying to you?

136
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:22,365
I'm not talking to you.

137
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:25,493
I caught Jim talking to
himself several times today.

138
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:26,869
What a loser.

139
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,872
Get a friend, loser!

140
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:34,126
Yeah, I'm looking at it right
now, it's really gorgeous.

141
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,586
You guys do great work.

142
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,090
I found the best "tentist"
on the East Coast.

143
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:43,386
He personally tented Giuliani's
first and third weddings.

144
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,889
And I got him.
I got him.

145
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:51,477
Would you be able to do the same
design, but with walls of gray?

146
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:54,563
And a top that's gray, too?
Fabulous.

147
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:56,732
Come on.

148
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:58,109
What?
You, too?

149
00:05:58,193 --> 00:05:59,402
Did my scores drop a little?

150
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,445
Jim, they are poopy.

151
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:06,283
Jim?

152
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:08,703
Jim?

153
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,872
Are we even sure
that's my file?

154
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:13,040
No.

155
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,836
Yes, I am sure, Jim, it...

156
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,004
Well, there's gotta
be an explanation.

157
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:19,130
I agree.

158
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:20,923
Yeah.
So, let's see

159
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:23,467
what we can find out
from reading.

160
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:27,388
Jim Halpert is
smudge and arrogant.

161
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:28,889
I think he means smug.

162
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,016
Arrogance.

163
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Michael,
I'm just trying to...

164
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:33,853
And there is
our smudgeness.

165
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:35,771
I need a decent bonus

166
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:39,025
because I'm actually in the process
of buying my parents' house

167
00:06:39,443 --> 00:06:41,402
so that they can retire.

168
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,864
And if history tells us anything,
it's that you can't go wrong

169
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,283
buying a house
you can't afford.

170
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:51,287
Pam doesn't know about the
house, so it's a fun surprise.

171
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:56,667
Pam, sorry about that.
Lost you for a second.

172
00:06:56,877 --> 00:07:00,171
So, as it turns out,
I may not have done so hot

173
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:01,964
on my customer
reviews this year.

174
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:03,382
Maybe it's 'cause you
spent the whole year

175
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,009
flirting with
the receptionist.

176
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,136
Little bit. Worth it.

177
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:12,808
Here's what's going to happen,
I am going to have to fix you.

178
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:16,937
Manage you two
on a more personal scale,

179
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,940
a more micro
form of management.

180
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:21,067
Jim, what is that called?

181
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,027
Micro-gement.
Boom. Yes.

182
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:25,154
Now, Jim is going
to be the client.

183
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:27,406
Dwight, you're going
to have to sell to him

184
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:30,993
without being aggressive,
hostile or difficult.

185
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:32,286
Let's go.

186
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,412
All right, fine.

187
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,082
Ring, ring.

188
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,208
Hello?

189
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,960
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from
the Dunder Mifflin paper company.

190
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:42,088
Well, that's great,
'cause I need paper.

191
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:44,048
Excellent, then you are in
luck, because we are having

192
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,717
a limited-time offer
only on everything.

193
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:47,802
Wow, this is
my lucky day.

194
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:48,886
Ask him his name.

195
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,137
What is your name, sir?

196
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:52,014
I am Bill Buttlicker.

197
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:54,767
Really?
That's your real name?

198
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:56,018
How dare you?

199
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,979
My family built this
country, by the way.

200
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:00,940
Be respectful, Dwight. Please.
Yes, Michael.

201
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:02,483
Could you hold on one second?
That's my other line.

202
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:03,776
What? No, but I... I'm on hold.

203
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,112
Hello? Yeah.

204
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:10,616
No. I'm just on the phone with this
stupid salesman. He's so dumb.

205
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,576
Probably just going to keep
him on the line forever

206
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,954
and not buy anything.

207
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:16,038
Okay.

208
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:17,623
It's up to you
to change his mind.

209
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:20,126
Sorry, that was
a family emergency.

210
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,293
Oh, no, what's wrong?

211
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:23,087
You know what?
That's private.

212
00:08:23,171 --> 00:08:24,463
Boundaries, Dwight.
Come on!

213
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:25,965
I'm sorry,
Mr. Buttlicker.

214
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:27,133
As I was saying...

215
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:29,135
Sorry, you just have to
speak a little bit louder,

216
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:30,803
I'm hard of hearing. He's hard of...
He's an old man.

217
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,805
Okay, as I was
saying, right now...

218
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:33,889
You're gonna
have to talk louder.

219
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:35,641
Okay, our prices
have never been lower...

220
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:36,809
Son, you have to
talk louder.

221
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:37,852
Never been lower!

222
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:38,936
Louder, son!

223
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,564
Buttlicker, our prices
have never been lower!

224
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,607
Stop it! Stop it!
He...

225
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:46,652
That is totally
inappropriate.

226
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:47,862
You never yell
at the client.

227
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:49,572
You never yell at the client.
Now you listen to me, sir.

228
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:50,656
Here we go.

229
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,741
The three words I
would describe you as

230
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:55,828
is aggressive, hostile
and definitely difficult.

231
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:57,663
Please, Mr. Buttlicker...
I'm irate right now.

232
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:58,747
Give me the phone.

233
00:08:58,832 --> 00:08:59,999
Please give me
another chance.

234
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,334
Mr. Buttlicker, I have to
put you on with my boss.

235
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,836
Well, I should hope so.

236
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,880
Who is this?
Hello, this is Michael Scott,

237
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,006
regional manager.

238
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,091
Well, this is
William M. Buttlicker.

239
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:11,927
Hello, Mr. Buttlicker,
how may we help you?

240
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:13,512
Michael, I like the
sound of your voice.

241
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:14,597
You know what
I'm going to do?

242
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:18,309
I'm going to buy $1,000,000
worth of paper products today.

243
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:20,311
See how it's done?

244
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:21,687
Thank you very much, sir.

245
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:23,564
I don't think you'll regret it.
See what I did?

246
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,648
You are the master.

247
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,733
There is one condition,
Michael.

248
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,526
Yes. You have to
fire the salesman

249
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:28,652
that treated me
so terribly.

250
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:30,946
Don't do it, Michael.

251
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,407
It's a million-dollar sale.

252
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:38,787
So it's called the Shangri-la Tent.
It's two stories, heated,

253
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:42,958
and it has a bridal suite
for my bridal sweet.

254
00:09:44,252 --> 00:09:47,046
It's just really simple,
really tasteful.

255
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:49,924
I don't want to be married
in a tent like a hobo.

256
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:51,800
Hobos live in trains.

257
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,762
Nana Mimi can't be
in canvas that long.

258
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:58,432
Well, Nana Mimi...
Okay, look.

259
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:01,435
This tent is awesome,

260
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,312
and it's in high demand,

261
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:06,690
so I really think we should
put a deposit down now.

262
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:11,946
Okay, fine. You can have your tent,
but only if it's in a field.

263
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,530
A hand-plowed field.

264
00:10:13,615 --> 00:10:14,823
Done and done-er.

265
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:19,119
There has to be a barn that's old
enough that you can see the stars

266
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:22,373
through the roof slats,
when you lay on your back.

267
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,834
And antique tools to look
at when you roll over.

268
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:28,420
Do you have a specific
place in mind?

269
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:29,546
No.

270
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:32,466
But anything within a five-to-eight
mile radius is acceptable.

271
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:33,884
On it.

272
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:35,552
Dwight.

273
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,097
Dwight.

274
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,100
Get in.
Are you serious?

275
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:42,393
Get in.

276
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:50,651
Okay, what are you...

277
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:55,364
They might be
listening to us.

278
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,616
What's that? Who is "they"?
They might be listening to us.

279
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:59,910
Customer service might be
monitoring this conversation!

280
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:00,995
In this car?

281
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,121
You never know.
Better safe than sorry.

282
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,416
What are you thinking here?

283
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,251
Who stands to benefit
from our downfall?

284
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,585
The mob?

285
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,628
Maybe NASA.

286
00:11:09,713 --> 00:11:10,879
Could be the mob.

287
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:12,631
But then Dunder Mifflin
would need to

288
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:13,966
be a front
for money laundering,

289
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,342
and there's
little evidence of that.

290
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:16,510
Is there some evidence?

291
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:17,970
Cute shoes online.

292
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,471
How many shoes
do you need?

293
00:11:19,556 --> 00:11:22,182
I don't know, two, maybe
three, if one wears out.

294
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,267
How many shoes
do you need?

295
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,601
I'm not talking to you.

296
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:26,312
Who are you talking to?
Pam.

297
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:27,646
She's not here, Jim.

298
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:28,939
No, she's not.

299
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,494
Yes!

300
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:45,789
I found it. I found the perfect place.
A local bed and breakfast

301
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:49,043
which is on a 60-acre beet
farm, and even better,

302
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:51,003
I have an in
with the owner.

303
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,963
Yeah, we work together.

304
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,466
It's Dwight Schrute.

305
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:58,135
As in Schrute Farms.

306
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,179
So I'd like to
redouble my order.

307
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:01,847
If you could
put me down for...

308
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:03,515
Wait, shut up!
I'm sorry?

309
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:06,185
Do you hear that?

310
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:07,269
Hear what?

311
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,314
Breathing. Is that you?

312
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:11,357
Well, I am breathing, yeah.

313
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,026
Well, stop.
Hold your breath.

314
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,194
I still hear it.

315
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,320
Who's there?

316
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,781
Kelly, is that you?

317
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:22,701
Hold on.

318
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:23,952
I need paper.

319
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:27,247
Oh, my God,
you scared me!

320
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,582
Hear anything interesting?

321
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,209
What are you talking about?

322
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:31,752
I think you know.

323
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,546
You always say that,
and I almost never know.

324
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,215
What are you up to, girl?

325
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,424
Did Phyllis
put you up to this?

326
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:38,717
Stanley?
Are they paying you?

327
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,135
Are you accusing me
of something?

328
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,804
Of course I am. I know
you're the mastermind,

329
00:12:41,888 --> 00:12:44,473
but you're too stupid
to do it by yourself.

330
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,850
Easy. Let's just
head back to the desk.

331
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:49,311
You just can't come into my
nook and call me stupid.

332
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:51,563
And maybe if you were a little
bit more nice and polite,

333
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:53,899
then people wouldn't give you
such bad customer reviews.

334
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:57,444
The reason that I got bad customer
reviews is because I didn't.

335
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:01,115
There is a massive conspiracy going
on here, and I know you're involved.

336
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,741
Dwight, get out of my nook.

337
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:04,076
That's what she said.
That's what she said!

338
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,953
That's what she said!

339
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:07,496
Good one.

340
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:16,338
Hey. Sorry about Dwight,
by the way.

341
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:17,548
Yeah, he's weird.

342
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,676
Well, we all
handle it differently.

343
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:24,346
I personally choose to handle
it like a normal person, but...

344
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:25,431
Okay.

345
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:26,932
Hey, how are you
and Darryl?

346
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,060
We're cool. Bye.

347
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:31,353
Bye.

348
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,356
That was weird.
What was?

349
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,066
Have you ever had
a conversation with Kelly

350
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:39,653
where she didn't go on for 15
minutes without taking a breath?

351
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,697
No, actually.
Did you do something to her?

352
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,365
I don't think so.

353
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,200
Well, something's off.

354
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:49,246
Hey, how's things?

355
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,414
All right.
Yeah?

356
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:51,457
Living in the moment.

357
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,041
Do you have
any reason to believe

358
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:54,209
that Kelly
would be mad at me?

359
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,628
I don't play the politics
game anymore, Jim.

360
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,172
Can I tell you something?

361
00:13:58,256 --> 00:13:59,673
I played it
full-on in New York.

362
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:02,217
I played it high stakes,
for keeps.

363
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:05,512
Made it to the top,
but look what it cost.

364
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:07,139
Can I tell you
what else I learned?

365
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,682
Wait, that's pretty weird.

366
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:09,766
What?

367
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:11,685
Well, Andy has
a mug just like that.

368
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:14,480
Yeah. Kelly gave them
out as party favors.

369
00:14:14,564 --> 00:14:16,231
Remember? You got one.
No.

370
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:18,358
What party? Her America's
Got Talent finale party

371
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,068
over the summer.

372
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,030
That's crazy. It was packed.
I thought everyone was there.

373
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,448
You were there. I
remember you being there.

374
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,908
I wasn't, but thank you.

375
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,534
Hey, do you know
anything about this party?

376
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:29,161
Yes. I said you
definitely should go,

377
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:30,829
but you wanted
to visit me instead.

378
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:33,499
I can't be the only one
who didn't...

379
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,392
Dwight, let me see
your coffee cup.

380
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:53,519
No.

381
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,354
Is that it?
No.

382
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:56,647
Why? No.

383
00:14:58,691 --> 00:14:59,858
Okay, I'm going to
assume that was it.

384
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:02,277
Here's the thing.
I think you're right.

385
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:05,572
I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad
at us for not coming to her party.

386
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:07,866
Man, I knew it. Who are
her co-conspirators?

387
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:09,034
Probably just Kelly.

388
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:11,119
Obviously. I knew it.

389
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,329
That's what I'm saying.

390
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,622
Yeah. What?

391
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:14,706
You were right.

392
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,916
I was right.

393
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,376
You were right.
I was right.

394
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,502
You knew it.
I knew it.

395
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:19,586
You knew it
the whole time, buddy.

396
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:21,046
I knew it
the whole time, buddy!

397
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,506
- Wow!
- Yeah!

398
00:15:22,966 --> 00:15:24,049
Right Dwight is loud.

399
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:25,634
Yes! I knew it!

400
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:26,927
Yeah!

401
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:31,557
Boom! Kelly the whole time.
Let's get her.

402
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,975
No, no, no, no.
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight.

403
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,142
Let's just
talk about this.

404
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:35,269
Get out of the way.

405
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:36,728
What's going on?

406
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,105
Why don't
you tell us?

407
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:39,439
Nothing's going on.

408
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:40,899
Let me
paint you a picture

409
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:43,235
of a little girl
from southern India,

410
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,404
who despite being welcomed
into this country

411
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:49,366
will now spend the rest of her life
in prison for a crime she did commit.

412
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,450
Dwight.

413
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:53,078
I was informed
by these gentlemen

414
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,871
that the reports
that you filed

415
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,165
may not entirely
be accurate.

416
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,668
What? I don't know
what you are talking about.

417
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:00,961
This is the first that
I'm hearing about this.

418
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,087
Come on.

419
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,922
You juked
the stats, cupcake.

420
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:05,048
We called about
a dozen customers and

421
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,925
they all said that they
gave us great marks.

422
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,635
What's going on?

423
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:13,515
I love your tie, Michael.

424
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,644
Kelly...
I was raped.

425
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:20,397
You cannot say
"I was raped"

426
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,524
and expect all your
problems to go away, Kelly.

427
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:25,027
Not again.
Don't keep doing that.

428
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:27,029
I'll give you one last
chance to come clean.

429
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,531
Just tell me
what happened.

430
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,619
Okay, all right. Okay, I did it.
All right? I lied.

431
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:34,828
Whatever, just fire me.

432
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,121
But you know what?
I did it because

433
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,331
you guys didn't
come to my party,

434
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:38,498
and you said
you would try to,

435
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:39,833
and then you
didn't even show up,

436
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,710
and so you're bad friends.

437
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,003
We have our confession.
I'm calling security.

438
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,463
Don't, don't.
Get away from that,

439
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:45,797
Dwight, please.

440
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:47,299
You know what? She's got
a point about you, too.

441
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,760
You do have a problem
dealing with people.

442
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:50,969
See? I wasn't lying.

443
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:52,429
You were lying.

444
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,722
I was lying.
Yes.

445
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,474
Jim, Dwight,
please excuse us.

446
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:56,808
But I want to be here
when you fire her ass.

447
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:59,895
I will call you
when it is time.

448
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:10,364
I have an enormous
amount of trouble

449
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,242
trying to get people
to come to my place.

450
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,411
And I hate it.

451
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:20,332
I can't tell you how
much leftover guacamole

452
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,043
I have ended up eating
over the years.

453
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:27,506
I don't even know why I make
it in such great quantities.

454
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:29,091
Here's what
we're going to do.

455
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,301
We are going to
sit here for a while,

456
00:17:31,386 --> 00:17:33,303
make it look good.

457
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:35,263
And maybe you should cry.

458
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,682
Can you make yourself cry?

459
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:37,724
No problem.

460
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:39,935
I think
you should do that.

461
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,577
Pam Beesly?

462
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:59,830
Hey. What are
you doing here?

463
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:00,956
Who's that?

464
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,332
It's Alex.

465
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,919
It's Pam.
I came to kidnap you.

466
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,131
There's free wine and cheese at the
Chuck Close retrospective. Let's go.

467
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:11,675
That's going to be great.
Who's Chuck Close?

468
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,970
I love Chuck Close and his
photorealist paintings.

469
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:16,304
But I have to work.

470
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,058
Well, actually,
there's something else

471
00:18:20,143 --> 00:18:22,561
I'd love to
talk to you about.

472
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:25,480
Can we go somewhere
else to talk about it?

473
00:18:26,566 --> 00:18:27,649
Okay.

474
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:29,276
That's it.
I want to talk to this guy.

475
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,610
Put me in his ear.

476
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:32,654
What's up?

477
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,322
I want to take a big leap.

478
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,908
And I want to tell you that
I think that you should not

479
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:39,077
move back to Scranton.

480
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:40,203
Wow.

481
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,080
I want to make
a bigger leap here.

482
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:43,582
He is into you.

483
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,126
Why did you come to New York
in the first place?

484
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,836
Because they have
a great design program,

485
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,422
and I wanted to see
if I was any good at it.

486
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,424
And I wanted to
work on my art, too.

487
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:53,508
Right.

488
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,469
And that's why I think
you should stay here.

489
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:58,054
Because, I mean, you
really just got here,

490
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:01,057
you know, and you can't do
New York in three months.

491
00:19:01,142 --> 00:19:04,686
You know, it has everything.
All the opportunity is here,

492
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,272
all the... The whole art
scene is in New York.

493
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,149
You know, it would be nuts
to go back to Scranton

494
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,693
without getting to
fully experience it.

495
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:13,779
Jim's in Scranton.

496
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:14,905
I know, but...

497
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:18,992
All I'm saying is, if there's
even a teeny, tiny part of you

498
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,244
that really wants
to be an artist,

499
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,955
then I think you should stay
here, because you don't want

500
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,249
to wake up in 50 years

501
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:29,252
and look back and wonder
what could have been.

502
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:32,964
And that is
the end of my speech.

503
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:35,425
I planned it all.
Anyway...

504
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,010
I will see you tomorrow.

505
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,221
I'll see you tomorrow.

506
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,276
Is that the
Matsahashi B-400?

507
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:54,986
The world's
tiniest Bluetooth.

508
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:58,865
May I?
Don't.

509
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,162
Congratulations on choosing
Schrute Farms for your wedding.

510
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,915
No, we haven't decided
on anything yet.

511
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,543
We're still
reviewing some options

512
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,169
and it's going to come
down to the numbers.

513
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:14,881
Well, then, why don't you look
over some of our materials,

514
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:19,594
while I describe to you
the Excalibur package.

515
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,680
In addition to the
breathtaking natural beauty

516
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,807
and smell
of Schrute Farms,

517
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,101
I can promise you that our
grounds can be catered

518
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,895
to fit your
exact specifications.

519
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,858
I will work tirelessly for
you over the coming months

520
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:35,527
and be at your
constant disposal.

521
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:40,115
Please feel free to call or stop
by any time of the day or night.

522
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:42,284
That's very generous.

523
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:43,660
Well, you,
my good friend,

524
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:44,828
have nothing more
to worry about.

525
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,247
This wedding is officially
out of your hands.

526
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,541
Thank the good Lord. Deal!

527
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,709
Okay.

528
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:52,794
What are we
talking pricewise?

529
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,254
You already said,
"Deal."

530
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,881
Pay him
whatever he wants.

531
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:57,632
Can't argue with that.

532
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:00,468
Dwight,

533
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:06,266
you are going to
make us so happy.
