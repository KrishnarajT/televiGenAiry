1
00:00:02,096 --> 00:00:05,139
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.

2
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:07,100
I just won
an art contest.

3
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:16,776
Thanks.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,944
I still don't
understand why you

5
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:19,362
- wanted me to say that.
- Shut up.

6
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:22,657
I got her.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,619
Not cool, Dwight.

8
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,871
Not cool, man.

9
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:07,869
Oh, no.

10
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:11,038
I still have the lease on the
Michael Scott Paper Company,

11
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:16,419
so occasionally, I will sneak down
here for a little coffee and dancing.

12
00:01:16,503 --> 00:01:19,839
I actually dance
all the time.

13
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:24,051
Tip-toeing around
corporate, it is a ballet.

14
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:28,222
When I am breaking all the
rules, I'm break dancing.

15
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:30,850
And espresso.

16
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:34,729
Guys, I'm scared.
I'm really scared.

17
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:36,481
I think I'm growing
into a giant,

18
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:39,275
because look at this
normal-sized coffee cup.

19
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,236
Looks so tiny in
my giant hand now.

20
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,990
Anybody want to go to
lunch with me later on?

21
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:48,910
I do. Okay, how about a woman?
Pam?

22
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:51,579
I can't do lunch. I was
just sending you an e-mail.

23
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:54,040
Jim and I need to leave early today
to meet with our contractor.

24
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:55,958
Really? Okay.

25
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,126
Just sent it.

26
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,753
What about
the rest of you?

27
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:01,339
At Dunder Mifflin,

28
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:05,468
there is a very strict
no-lunch-with-the-boss policy,

29
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:07,261
and I don't know
who instituted it.

30
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:11,015
I think it started right after
my predecessor stepped down.

31
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,725
But at the Michael
Scott Paper Company,

32
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,229
I really enjoyed having lunch
with Pam and Ryan every day.

33
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,525
So, rules be damned, I want to
have lunch with these people.

34
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:22,109
Who else?
Who else? Ryan?

35
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:24,529
I don't do lunch. I'm doing
five small meals a day now.

36
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:27,323
Now that I'm back to doing
the job of a temp again,

37
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:30,368
I find that food is one
thing I can control.

38
00:02:30,452 --> 00:02:33,996
Okay, anyone?
Anyone at all?

39
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:38,626
Accounting, I am a-counting on
you to go to lunch with me.

40
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,337
No, I don't want to stay late
to have a two-hour lunch.

41
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:43,172
Michael, we have
a lot of work to do.

42
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:44,382
What?

43
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:46,008
Work.

44
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:49,220
God. What happened
to you people?

45
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:50,847
"We are
just office drones.

46
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:55,142
"We are office drones.
All we do is work. Is work."

47
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:58,354
If you don't take out his battery,
he just keeps going all day.

48
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:00,690
Oh, no, your
battery fell out.

49
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:05,903
"I was just
learning to love."

50
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,700
Hi, guys.
How are you doing?

51
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:13,035
Erin, how many times
do I have to tell you?

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,204
It is not necessary for you
to ask us how we are doing

53
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,455
every time you
interact with us.

54
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,915
You're right.
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,794
Now, how can I help you?

56
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,339
Did somebody here leave a map in
the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?

57
00:03:26,508 --> 00:03:31,721
Attention, office. Who here is
planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio?

58
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:35,099
I will take your silence to mean
that you are all hiding something.

59
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:38,102
This location is
the superior court...

60
00:03:38,186 --> 00:03:40,271
So someone's going
to a court. Big deal.

61
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,231
It is a big deal, 'cause there's
only a handful of reasons

62
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:44,567
why someone would ever go
to a courthouse in Ohio

63
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:46,485
and not be charged with a crime.

64
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,821
Claim an inheritance
from a deceased relative,

65
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:52,617
to obtain a learner's permit
at age 141/2 instead of 15.

66
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,870
Erin, let me see
your birth certificate.

67
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:57,496
Sure.

68
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,499
There are other
reasons to go to Ohio.

69
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:01,626
We're getting
married today.

70
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,713
So, it turns out it's the closest
place to get a marriage license

71
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:06,839
without a three-day
waiting period.

72
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:07,924
Tell them how it happened.

73
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,592
Okay, so we're going through
all the wedding plans,

74
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:11,427
and, boy,
it is complicated.

75
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:12,511
And very expensive.

76
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:13,596
Very expensive.

77
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,889
'Cause you say you
want a small wedding

78
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,933
and that's great,
but then you have to...

79
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,768
You can't leave anyone out.
No one.

80
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,394
Okay, just get
to the good part.

81
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,356
Right, so, this morning, we are
having breakfast together...

82
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Mmm-hmm.

83
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:28,235
and I just looked up
from my cereal and I said,

84
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:33,074
"You know what I want to do today?
I want to marry you."

85
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:36,702
I had just woken up.
I didn't look cute.

86
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:38,829
That's how I
knew he meant it.

87
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:41,207
Michael?

88
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,543
Michael, sorry to bother you. Are
you going to be working down here?

89
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:45,628
Do you want
these down here...

90
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:47,254
No work! No work! No work!

91
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:49,090
I come here to
release frustration.

92
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:53,761
Well, I like to swim.
That's good.

93
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:56,013
You've got a
cool place to come.

94
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:59,225
If you ever want to come down
here, door's always open.

95
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:00,476
Lock's broken, so...

96
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Thank you.

97
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:04,605
Give me your hand. Hey, here
we go, here we go. Yeah.

98
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:07,066
There we go. Now you got it.
Now I do got it.

99
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,818
Now you got it. Hey, you
want some espresso?

100
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:09,986
Yeah.

101
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,070
Gotta keep
yourself dehydrated.

102
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:12,905
That's rule number one. Okay.

103
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,824
I love it.
I love it.

104
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:21,247
Guys, I believe that I have figured
out what is up your butts.

105
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:24,000
There's no reason
to be scared.

106
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,377
The bad man is gone.
Charles is gone.

107
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:28,004
Charles really did
a number on these guys.

108
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:30,006
They are way too
focused on work.

109
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,844
When I was in charge, this place
was like Dave & Buster's,

110
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:39,348
people just hanging out,
having fun, eating apps.

111
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:44,186
I don't know, it's like
Dave died or something.

112
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:48,024
Daddy's here, and Daddy is
going to take care of you.

113
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,859
Please don't refer to
yourself as our daddy.

114
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:56,032
I am your big daddy, and I am
going to kiss the boo-boo.

115
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:58,534
Little
Andy is afraid.

116
00:05:58,618 --> 00:05:59,869
Andy's afraid?
Yes.

117
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:01,537
Are you all afraid?
No.

118
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:05,541
Daddy's here for you,
my little angels.

119
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,334
Okay,

120
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,880
I think that I have figured a way
to get you guys out of your funk.

121
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:12,965
What?
Funk is the problem,

122
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,051
and the solution.
That makes sense.

123
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:16,552
I have taken my
downstairs office

124
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:18,888
and I have turned it
into a place to hang out,

125
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:23,225
a place where unattractive and
attractive people can get together,

126
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,438
to meet, to greet, to see
the ones that you love,

127
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:29,732
to love the ones
that you see.

128
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:32,193
Is this our punishment for not
wanting to have lunch with you?

129
00:06:32,277 --> 00:06:34,111
Why don't you get
over lunch, Oscar?

130
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:35,237
Everybody else is past it.

131
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:39,200
All work and no play
makes Michael a dull boy.

132
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:40,993
This is like a haunted
coffee house thing?

133
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:44,830
No, Dwight is confusing you.
It's more of a disco.

134
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:46,082
It's like a haunted disco.

135
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,584
With coffee, but
without the haunting.

136
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:50,878
It's a combo dance
house-coffee bar.

137
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,590
It is a daytime disco
on the ground floor

138
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:56,217
of an industrial
office building.

139
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,343
It's a Cafe Disco.

140
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:58,427
Exactly.

141
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:00,137
Like a disco-cafe.

142
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:03,557
What? No. No.
Not even close.

143
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:06,894
I can't force you to go
down, but I can entice you.

144
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:09,105
I'm going to
be down there.

145
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:11,023
Erin will be down there
from time to time,

146
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:13,651
and all-you-can-eat espresso.

147
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:22,952
Well, Kevin, I guess
it is just me and you.

148
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:24,954
Yeah.
Holding down the fort.

149
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,623
Yeah. This place is great.

150
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:28,749
Thank you.

151
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:31,669
Oh, my God, Kevin,
I am still on hold.

152
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:32,753
You were supposed
to get the answer

153
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:33,963
from Michael
and come back up.

154
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:37,466
This is a no-work zone.
Please respect the lei.

155
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,427
Yeah, respect the lei.

156
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:42,847
Come.

157
00:07:43,223 --> 00:07:44,265
Kevin, stay.

158
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:45,766
Kevin, come.

159
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:47,309
Kevin, stay.

160
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,812
Kevin, come.
Stay, stay.

161
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:52,690
Come on, right now.
Cookie, Kevin. Cookie.

162
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:55,734
There is
no cookie, Kevin.

163
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:57,611
Is there a cookie?
Mmm-hmm.

164
00:07:59,072 --> 00:08:00,281
Come on.

165
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:03,659
For goodness sakes,
Kevin, there's no cookie.

166
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:06,662
There's no cookie.
Come on. Come.

167
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:08,372
I wanted a cookie.

168
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,124
Completely unacceptable.

169
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:14,962
Now I know what the founders
of Philip Morris felt like.

170
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:21,719
You just want to give people
a smooth, fun way to relax,

171
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:26,724
and suddenly, you're just
some terrible monster.

172
00:08:34,274 --> 00:08:35,357
Here we go.

173
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:04,511
What the hell!

174
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,225
Hi, Jessica,
is Bob in?

175
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:10,392
He's on a call.

176
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:11,477
Well, I'll just
duck my head in.

177
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:14,313
It's pretty important. He
wouldn't want to be disturbed.

178
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:16,774
Can I give him a message
before he gets off?

179
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:19,235
Tell him I'm going
dancing downstairs

180
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:20,945
in the storage closet
between the bathrooms

181
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,073
that used to be a utility shower,
and he should join me there.

182
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:25,407
I'll let him know.

183
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,159
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,165
Phyllis?

185
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,000
Hi.

186
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:37,753
Hey.
Hey,

187
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:38,879
I like.

188
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:50,724
All right. Back... There you go.
There you go. You got it.

189
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:54,061
Show me some attitude.

190
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,940
Mother.

191
00:09:58,024 --> 00:09:59,817
God. No, no, no.

192
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:00,943
Back.

193
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:02,945
Wow, what did you do?

194
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,282
You didn't do that.
You're okay.

195
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:08,409
You're okay.
Let's lie down.

196
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:10,035
Give me... You want
to go down? All right.

197
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,829
Sorry.

198
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,789
Okay, that's okay.

199
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:17,001
Backs are a problem.
Okay, sweetie...

200
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:18,127
Right here.

201
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:27,469
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I got your text.
Who's Phillip?

202
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:28,929
No, no, no.

203
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:30,639
Who tipped you over?
Was it Phillip?

204
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:31,724
It's my back.

205
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:32,850
It's her back.
We just... We need...

206
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:33,934
God, call a doctor.

207
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,352
You know what? We're going
to take care of you.

208
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:37,146
We're going to get you help.
Come on, come on.

209
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,355
Call Bob.

210
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,523
No, no, no,
this is no good.

211
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,650
Yeah, back
injuries are common.

212
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:42,818
Not as common
as knee injuries,

213
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:43,944
but more common
than wrist injuries.

214
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,321
I don't need a
history lesson, okay?

215
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:46,572
What do you
think history is?

216
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,032
Just... We need to
get her out of there

217
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:50,034
because no one is going
to want to go in there

218
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:52,244
with a woman writhing
around on the floor.

219
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,747
Wait, wait, wait,
but most importantly,

220
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:58,334
we need to get her some
medical attention ASAP, stat.

221
00:10:58,418 --> 00:10:59,710
Here we go.
Here we go.

222
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:01,253
Ramming speed.

223
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:03,130
Okay, out of the way.
Move it or lose it.

224
00:11:03,256 --> 00:11:05,341
Oh, my God, what happened? You
having fun taking a little ride?

225
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:06,800
Just having
too much fun.

226
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:09,178
Phyllis, we're gonna put you in here.
Dwight's gonna take care of you.

227
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:11,680
What? No, I thought we were
going to the hospital.

228
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:13,223
If you want to get sick,
you go to a hospital.

229
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:16,643
Okay, Dwight.
Okay, good.

230
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,395
I do not want
anybody to worry.

231
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,646
What happened
to Phyllis?

232
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:22,441
You know,
nothing. She's...

233
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,069
We were hanging
out at Cafe Disco

234
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:26,862
and she had a flare-up
of an existing injury,

235
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:28,447
but she's a
tough old bird, so...

236
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:29,865
Can you please
go back to work

237
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:31,867
instead of masterminding
these situations

238
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:33,243
wherein we
hurt ourselves?

239
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,454
Okay, fine. Phyllis
did injure herself,

240
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:37,623
but she injured
herself having fun,

241
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:40,376
and I don't think she would
trade that memory for anything.

242
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,380
I would like the
memory of a day

243
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:46,757
uninterrupted
by this nonsense.

244
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:50,636
You all took a life here today.
You did.

245
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,179
The life of the party.

246
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:56,308
Erin, I want you
to go downstairs,

247
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,811
and I want you
to shut it down.

248
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:00,646
You mean unplug the coffee
machine and bring it up here?

249
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,314
I don't care. Bury it.

250
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:04,733
I hope you're happy.

251
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:13,200
Okay. I'm going to need
two able-bodied men.

252
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:17,955
Cafe Disco? More
like crappy disco.

253
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,456
You're bad.

254
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,016
There's girls in there. Where?

255
00:12:38,101 --> 00:12:39,601
The other room.
What other room?

256
00:12:39,686 --> 00:12:41,437
Down the hall.
There's girls there?

257
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:42,604
What did I just say?

258
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:43,689
You bring my sandwich?

259
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:44,982
Forget the sandwich.

260
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:46,775
Girls. Girls.

261
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:53,449
I guess they got what they want.
I am eating alone.

262
00:12:55,368 --> 00:12:56,785
Might as well be dinner.

263
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:05,544
Comfy? All right, all right.
Just relax, relax, okay?

264
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:08,464
Dwight. Dwight.

265
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:11,550
Come on, relax. This shirt
wasn't doing you any favors.

266
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:15,637
If my assessment is correct,
you grind your teeth?

267
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:16,889
I do.

268
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:22,019
No kidding. She sits three feet from me.
It's the most annoying thing.

269
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:26,106
It's like children
singing Christmas carols.

270
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:42,122
Yeah. I'm loving
the vibe down here.

271
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,124
Ashley. You made it.

272
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:47,920
You invited someone?

273
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:49,505
Oh. Yeah. Was I not
allowed to do that?

274
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,508
I don't know. I've been here
eight years, and I've never...

275
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:53,675
Rude.

276
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:05,354
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty
sure I'm in a dance-off.

277
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:13,320
Cafe Disco is dead, but I can
still hear the music in my head.

278
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:14,780
I hear it, too, boss.

279
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:36,426
It's better
than I imagined it.

280
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:40,180
It feels good, Dwight.

281
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:41,306
Tell me where it hurts.

282
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:44,643
Right... Right there.

283
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:47,563
Yeah, you've got
a knot in your crest.

284
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:50,440
This remedy has been passed down
in my family for generations,

285
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:52,276
and it always works.

286
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,655
My grandfather was told that Diamond
Dancer would never race again.

287
00:14:56,739 --> 00:15:00,742
They were wrong. He came in
ninth in the Apple Creek Derby.

288
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:03,870
And his jerky came in
third the following year.

289
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:08,500
A majestic beast.
So fast, so tender.

290
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:14,923
Welcome, welcome. Cafe Disco.
I am Michael Scott.

291
00:15:15,008 --> 00:15:16,216
Hey, Angela,
welcome to Cafe...

292
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:17,426
Stop!

293
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,887
Angela, Angela, Angela, may I
interest you in a triple espresso,

294
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:22,431
or perhaps a dance?

295
00:15:22,515 --> 00:15:25,017
No, I didn't come down
here to get wet and wild.

296
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:26,226
I just need you
to sign these.

297
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:29,271
All right.
Here you go.

298
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:30,772
And, no, you need
to sign them all.

299
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:32,482
No, no, no.
Here is the deal.

300
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,943
One signature
for every song.

301
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:37,070
Look, I hate to
be "that" person,

302
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:39,448
but I just don't like the
general spirit of music.

303
00:15:39,532 --> 00:15:43,910
I know, I know. Angela, a lot of
people doubted Cafe Disco at first,

304
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:47,539
but it is a magical place. You
have to give it a chance.

305
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:50,459
If these walls could
talk, they would say,

306
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:53,754
"This is a magical place.
You're safe here.

307
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:57,132
"We are talking walls.
We're not going to eat you."

308
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:01,219
No.

309
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:05,307
This is oil from
the gland of an otter.

310
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:08,560
It keeps their fur water
resistant, as well as traps heat.

311
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:10,395
Now, I need you to
lie still for an hour.

312
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,606
An hour? I can't
stay here an hour.

313
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,193
Whoa, whoa, girl.
Whoa. Whoa.

314
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:20,447
Boss, this used to hang from my
windshield, but it belongs in here.

315
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:23,408
Hey, thank you, Creed.
You really get this place.

316
00:16:23,493 --> 00:16:27,412
No problem. I'll just have no
idea who's driving behind me now.

317
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:35,253
Look out.

318
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:41,635
Yeah!
Yeah.

319
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:45,222
Yeah!
Finish it off.

320
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,765
Oh, no! Oh, no!

321
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,481
Here we go. Okay,
something's gonna happen.

322
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:04,574
Here we go. Yeah.

323
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:24,386
I'm going to go
with the python.

324
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:26,221
But the rattler's so scary.

325
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:30,016
No, please, I find the rattle soothing.
Puts me to sleep.

326
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:32,978
I think Bob's going to cheat
on me with his new secretary.

327
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:41,027
What's so funny?

328
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:44,656
When I say it out
loud, it's so silly.

329
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:52,205
Hey, hey, Angela, no.
No cleaning up.

330
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:54,708
You are forcing me
to be down here.

331
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,334
Am I not allowed
to have some fun?

332
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,170
No cleaning up.

333
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:12,267
These are for you.

334
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:14,436
They're beautiful.

335
00:18:15,354 --> 00:18:17,147
You ready?
Yeah.

336
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,543
We should probably stop by.
It would mean a lot to him.

337
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:47,093
Hey. Hey. Man,
Jim and Pam.

338
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:50,180
Can you believe this?
It's really happening.

339
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,724
Want to dance, Dwight?

340
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:54,518
Ordinarily,
I would say no,

341
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:58,021
but you need to move to
reduce lactic acid buildup.

342
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:00,941
Also, this song
is fantastic.

343
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:04,152
Mind if I steal my wife?

344
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:07,197
You can't steal what is
legally your property.

345
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:12,577
Are those staples?

346
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:15,705
This dance competition
is not over.

347
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,251
What dance competition? I was just
dancing casually with my friend, y'all.

348
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:20,752
Yeah, right.

349
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:38,645
You guys are the
best for coming.

350
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:40,981
You don't have to stay if you
don't want to. I understand.

351
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:42,732
We're going to stay.
Really?

352
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,776
At least for
one more dance.

353
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:49,072
No, not me. Not me. Get out of here.
Cafe Disco.

354
00:19:49,156 --> 00:19:52,659
Hey, come on, man.
We're not even to "Y."

355
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:54,119
This is so cheesy.

356
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:55,328
Yes.

357
00:20:00,626 --> 00:20:02,002
I like cheesy.

358
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:03,211
Me, too.

359
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:10,135
You know, I think maybe I
want a wedding wedding.

360
00:20:11,137 --> 00:20:12,220
Me, too.

361
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:13,805
Really?
Yeah.

362
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:22,647
Would you like
to dance?

363
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,149
No.

364
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,702
Yeah. No, well, okay...
Stop squirming.

365
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:37,621
Well, stop trying to poke
me with a sharp thing.

366
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:39,748
You wanted to do this, okay?
Just be brave.

367
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:41,124
I know, but you're
not a professional,

368
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,709
and I'm thinking maybe we
should have gone that route.

369
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:44,377
I'm doing... No, I'm
doing it for free.

370
00:20:44,462 --> 00:20:45,587
Just... You have
to stop squirming,

371
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:46,796
otherwise, I'm
going to mess up.

372
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,381
Are you sure that's
not the gay ear?

373
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,008
Gay ear?
Are you 12 years old?

374
00:20:50,092 --> 00:20:51,134
Well, I...

375
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:52,427
Look, I'm going to
count to three.

376
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,511
Count to 20.

377
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:56,348
No, I'm going to count to three.
One, two, three.

378
00:20:56,432 --> 00:20:57,933
Son of a bitch!

379
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:00,018
Andy, that was
just the ice.

380
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:01,519
It was?
Yeah, it was.
