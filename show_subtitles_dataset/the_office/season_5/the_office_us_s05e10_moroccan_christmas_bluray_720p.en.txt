1
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,294
What is this?

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,920
Happy holidays, Dwight.

3
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,131
But do not open it
till Christmas.

4
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,800
You're so pathetic. How long did
this take you, three hours?

5
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:21,095
Five minutes, actually. I'm a
black belt in gift wrapping.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,263
Yeah, no such thing.

7
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:25,224
They don't give out black belts
for things that are stupid.

8
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:27,060
Well, I hope
it was worth it,

9
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:29,854
because I'm going to take it
apart in about five minutes.

10
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:31,814
I think it'll take you a
little bit longer than that.

11
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,109
Really. If I can skin a mule
deer in less than 10 minutes,

12
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:37,487
I ought to be
able to cut my...

13
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,860
I'm sorry. It's the
largest one I have.

14
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,446
I will not be the big
guy in the tiny hat.

15
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,533
This is the first
Christmas party

16
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,910
I'm throwing as head of the
Party Planning Committee.

17
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,830
The theme is
Nights in Morocco.

18
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:31,916
This isn't your grandmother's
Christmas party.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,876
Unless of course
she's from Morocco,

20
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,712
in which case
it's very accurate.

21
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:39,340
Hey, Phyllis, do I need this
invite to get into the party?

22
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:40,842
Yes.
Awesome.

23
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:45,012
I think this is going to be the
best Christmas party ever.

24
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,060
Angela, you're going to move
this for the party, right?

25
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:52,729
It's not on theme.

26
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,731
It's the Nativity scene.

27
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:57,275
All right.

28
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,737
You can keep your camel,
sheep, elephant... Hey.

29
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,196
And the North African
king can stay.

30
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:05,408
Everything else
goes in the drawer.

31
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:09,537
I am not going to judge Phyllis
for desecrating Christmas.

32
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:11,414
There is one person
who will, though,

33
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,499
and Phyllis just
stuffed him into a drawer.

34
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:15,001
I need you to
get rid of the tree.

35
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,003
But... But...
Thank you.

36
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,465
Oh, I don't
think it's blackmail.

37
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,842
Angela just does
what I ask her to do

38
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:27,096
so I won't tell everyone that she's
cheating on Andy with Dwight.

39
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,931
I think for it
to be blackmail,

40
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,058
it would have to be
a formal letter.

41
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,693
Ah, you brought in
your doll collection.

42
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:42,612
These are not dolls, Jim.

43
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,865
These are commodities,
same as gold or oil.

44
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,575
Every year,
I do research to determine

45
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,620
which toy will be the most
popular of the Christmas season.

46
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,290
This year, it's a doll.
Half-girl, half-unicorn.

47
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,211
Catchphrase, "My horn
can pierce the sky!"

48
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:00,546
Pathetic.

49
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:04,467
I bought out every store in the
area over the last couple of weeks.

50
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,886
And as lazy parents
become more desperate,

51
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,305
I will sell them
at an enormous profit.

52
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,433
Isn't that right, princess?

53
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:14,852
That's the Christmas spirit.

54
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,521
I am simply punishing
those parents

55
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,232
that would wait till the last
minute to give their child a gift,

56
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:21,150
and such a genetically
improbable one.

57
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,902
Look at that.
How does that happen?

58
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,779
The king has sex
with a unicorn?

59
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:26,614
Man with a horn has sex
with a royal horse?

60
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,157
Yes. Hey, is that
Princess Unicorn?

61
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,617
I thought they were
all sold out.

62
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,244
They are now.
Cool.

63
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:34,205
My horn
can pierce the sky!

64
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:45,758
This is equal parts scotch,
absinthe, rum, gin,

65
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:49,595
vermouth, triple sec,
and two packs of Splenda.

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,931
Call it a
"one of everything."

67
00:03:56,311 --> 00:04:00,022
Oh, my God!

68
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,859
Hit me again!
All right.

69
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,026
One more time
around the block.

70
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,822
I will grant you one wish.

71
00:04:08,657 --> 00:04:11,701
I wish you would stop rubbing
that lamp in that creepy way.

72
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,954
Stupid. Everybody knows to
ask for 100 more wishes.

73
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,122
Dumb.

74
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:25,882
Hey, hey, Ang,
check it out.

75
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:32,722
There's a place in France
Where the naked ladies dance

76
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,975
Really, Andy?
It's Christmas,

77
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,352
and you're singing
about nudity and France.

78
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:46,193
There's a hole in the wall
Where the men can see it all

79
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:50,531
Jim, check that out.
What is it?

80
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:53,034
That is vodka, and I mixed
it with orange juice.

81
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:55,202
I call it an
"orange vodjuiceka."

82
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:00,207
Wow, that is delicious.
Yeah.

83
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,126
I can't believe no one's
thought of that. I know!

84
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,018
Belly dancing.

85
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,771
$120, $180, $200.

86
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,105
All right.

87
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,608
Oh, thank you so much. My
daughter is going to love this.

88
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,610
Oh. So glad I could help.
Thanks.

89
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,028
Merry Christmas.
You, too.

90
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:31,864
Fa la la la, la la, ka-ching

91
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,704
Oh. So this is what every day would
be like if you hadn't left India?

92
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,377
She's burning.

93
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:45,586
Oh, my God!

94
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,464
We got
a live one! On fire!

95
00:05:57,766 --> 00:06:00,309
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

96
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,115
Sorry.

97
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,909
We're back on the 5th.
Should we just do it then?

98
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:20,413
Cannot do it then, monthly
dental appointment.

99
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,664
Soft teeth.

100
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,582
What about
February 2nd?

101
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,960
Would you want to
do it on Groundhog Day?

102
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:29,422
No. No. I celebrate privately.
That's right.

103
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,507
Why don't we just do it now?
We'll do it quickly.

104
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,551
Now? It's our Christmas party.
We'll do it quickly.

105
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:34,719
Well, what if we
can't do it quickly?

106
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:36,012
"What if we can't
do it quickly?

107
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,847
"What if we can't do it?"

108
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,641
Do you know how
to do an intervention?

109
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:42,143
Hey, shut up.

110
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:43,728
Here we go.
Everybody, gather up.

111
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:46,188
An intervention, it's
sort of hard to describe,

112
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:50,234
but, really,
it's a coming together.

113
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:55,614
It's a surprise party for
people who have addictions.

114
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,827
And you get in their face
and you scream at them,

115
00:06:59,911 --> 00:07:03,372
and you make them feel really
badly about themselves.

116
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,665
And then they stop.

117
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,792
It looks like we're going
to be here for a while,

118
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:09,253
so why don't you make a little
plate of hummus for everyone?

119
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:11,922
Little triangles of pita,
toasted on both side,

120
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,424
fanned so you can
easily grab them.

121
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:15,634
I know...
And napkins, fanned.

122
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:20,139
Okay. How do you feel?

123
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,932
Little better.
I threw up.

124
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:25,186
TMI.
Fire girl.

125
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,398
Too soon.
Yeah.

126
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,901
Okay, you know what I
thought we should do

127
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,445
is have a quick intervention and
then get back to the party.

128
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,364
Michael, we're only allowed to talk
about Meredith's work performance.

129
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:38,908
We cannot ask her
to stop drinking.

130
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,743
I am not asking her
to stop drinking.

131
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,914
I am imploring her to
quit being an alcoholic.

132
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,123
I'm not an alcoholic.

133
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,042
Yeah,
obviously you are.

134
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,670
Okay, everybody who thinks
that Meredith is an alcoholic,

135
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:53,047
please raise
your hands.

136
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,924
Aye.
The ayes have it.

137
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,718
I don't care what
everyone thinks.

138
00:07:57,803 --> 00:08:00,846
I know I am not an alcoholic.

139
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:03,224
All right, well,

140
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:06,018
let's look at this a little
bit closer, then, shall we?

141
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,856
When I was in college,
I used to get wicked hammered.

142
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,111
My nickname was "Puke."
I would chug a fifth of So-Co,

143
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:19,865
sneak into a frat party, polish
off a few people's empties,

144
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,910
some brewskies,
some Jell-O shots,

145
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:25,454
do some body shots
off myself,

146
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,957
pass out, wake up
the next morning,

147
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:32,336
boot, rally, more So-Co,
head to class.

148
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,297
Probably would have gotten expelled
if I'd let it affect my grades,

149
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,467
but I aced all my courses.
They called me "Ace."

150
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:42,263
It was totally awesome. I got straight Bs.
They called me "Buzz."

151
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,600
Meredith, "have you ever used
alcohol to alter your mood

152
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:48,769
"or deliberately change
your state of mind?"

153
00:08:48,854 --> 00:08:49,895
Sure.

154
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,022
"Do you sometimes have
a drink to celebrate

155
00:08:52,107 --> 00:08:54,483
"a special occasion
or mark a holiday?"

156
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:55,901
Obviously.

157
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,113
"Have you ever, under
the influence of alcohol,

158
00:08:59,197 --> 00:09:01,824
"questioned the teachings
of the Mormon Church?"

159
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:05,077
Where did you get this? I got it on
a website. That's not important.

160
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:06,537
Michael, we should
contact some experts.

161
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:07,997
You don't know
what you're doing.

162
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,500
Okay, you know what, Toby? One of my
employees is undergoing a crisis,

163
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,335
and I wish, for just once,

164
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,296
you would take
my side on this.

165
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,047
I'm doing your job, man.

166
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:19,258
Hey, are you texting?

167
00:09:19,342 --> 00:09:21,177
Yeah, 'cause
this is kind of a drag.

168
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,846
Alcohol is a drag, yes.
Here's what I'd like to do.

169
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,017
I'd like to go around the room and
have us each express to Meredith

170
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,728
how her alcoholism
has affected us.

171
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:34,023
I'll begin.
This Christmas party

172
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,860
is perhaps the best Christmas
party I have ever been to.

173
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,447
But then you got so drunk that
we had to stop and do this.

174
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,949
That's how your
drinking affected me.

175
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:48,245
Anybody else? Another time when
Meredith's drinking affected you?

176
00:09:50,081 --> 00:09:51,749
Come on, people.
If we don't say anything,

177
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,500
she's not going to
get any better.

178
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:55,127
Yes, Kevin.

179
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:57,796
Well, Meredith,
there was that one time

180
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:59,673
that you bought
movie tickets

181
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:02,092
and then you got
too drunk to go,

182
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:06,263
so you gave them to me,
and that was really cool.

183
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,600
That's... You didn't...
You weren't hurt by that.

184
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:11,852
Yeah, you said
"affected" by it.

185
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,145
Thanks again, Meredith.
You're welcome.

186
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,356
No, that's not
what we're going for.

187
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,109
Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?
It has to bother you.

188
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:22,279
It bothers me, right?
How does it bother you?

189
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,240
Dwight, don't you
have anything?

190
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,242
No. I like Meredith.

191
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,910
Actually, I don't
care for Meredith,

192
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,037
but I don't believe in
this kind of thing.

193
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,332
In the Schrute family, we believe
in a five-fingered intervention.

194
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:37,836
Awareness, education, control,
acceptance and punching.

195
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:40,214
Who's going to tell us
the latest dirty joke?

196
00:10:40,298 --> 00:10:42,675
Who is going to tell us what you
watched on television last night?

197
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,260
I am fine.

198
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:48,097
Was John Belushi fine?
Was Bob Hope fine?

199
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,684
Hey, come here.

200
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:56,522
If anything ever
happened to you,

201
00:10:56,606 --> 00:11:00,693
I would be very angry at myself for
not doing all that I could do.

202
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,655
I know I drink.
I like to party.

203
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:06,573
I want you to say,
"I'm an alcoholic."

204
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:09,118
I'm not an alcoholic!

205
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,995
You can say it
as loudly as you want,

206
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,289
but we're not going
to believe you.

207
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:17,710
I was waiting until later to hand out
this year's gifts from corporate.

208
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:22,464
I don't think they're
appropriate anymore.

209
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,596
Please stop making me
do these things.

210
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,473
Sorry, it's your job.

211
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,642
But it's the season of mercy.

212
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,979
You never showed me mercy
when you were in charge.

213
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,732
Why aren't you
wearing the hairnet?

214
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,150
I lost it.

215
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:44,820
Fine.

216
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,953
Okay. Nice.

217
00:11:56,124 --> 00:12:00,919
I don't mind telling you that
I have an addiction. I do.

218
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,087
To porn.

219
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,507
All right,
no, no, no, no.

220
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,261
That is... The image, I think we
can all agree, is very disgusting,

221
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:11,680
but you know what,
Meredith?

222
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:16,518
You lit your hair on fire today.
What about tomorrow?

223
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:20,564
What is going to happen when you
come into work and you're dead?

224
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:23,192
I stab her in the brain
with a wooden stick.

225
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,402
There are several ways
to kill a zombie,

226
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:29,239
but the most satisfying one is to stab
it in the brain with a wooden stick.

227
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:32,701
Everyone in this
room loves you.

228
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:36,121
But mark my words, we are not going
to support your alcoholism anymore.

229
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,540
The next time you light
yourself on fire,

230
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,168
we are not going to
help put you out.

231
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,713
Oh, as fire marshal,
I would have to.

232
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,256
Dwight.
She is a hazard

233
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:48,967
to the other people of the office.
Okay.

234
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:52,679
I suppose I could do it if it was a
controlled burn in a well-ventilated area.

235
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:54,473
Yeah, but you're going
to need a permit for that.

236
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,392
Right. That'll take
a couple weeks.

237
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,643
I can get you one
in an hour.

238
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,604
Really? Okay, you
know, this is over.

239
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:01,730
I agree.

240
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:05,234
I think you did the best you could,
but this is bigger than all of us.

241
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:10,280
Enabler, enabler, enabler,
enabler, enabler, enabler.

242
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:12,574
It's Christmas, and we
are turning our back

243
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,202
on somebody who is
asking for help.

244
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:17,454
You know what the only thing
I want for Christmas?

245
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:21,083
I want Meredith to get better.
That's my only wish.

246
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,668
But you know what?
My wishes never come true.

247
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:24,711
So I'm not going to
wish that on her.

248
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:26,880
A watch would be nice.

249
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,095
They've been in there
for 45 minutes.

250
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,263
I know.

251
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,932
If she wasn't an alcoholic
before, she is now.

252
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,269
That's a halwa
shebakia cookie.

253
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,312
They serve it
during Ramadan.

254
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:46,108
Mmm. Chewy.

255
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:55,159
Hey.

256
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,706
What's up?
Do you take requests?

257
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:02,249
Sure.
Please stop,

258
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,043
because we're having
a Christmas party.

259
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,562
I'll be down in a minute.

260
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,651
Could you write
down the number

261
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,404
of that rehabilitation
center that you mentioned?

262
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:34,364
Sure. Wow.

263
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:42,206
Ow!

264
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,172
We just missed
Poor Richard's.

265
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,298
We did?
Yeah.

266
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,300
I thought we were going out for a drink.
Oh, shoot.

267
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:57,513
Oh, well, we'll have to go
someplace else, then, I guess.

268
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:58,639
The Bog.

269
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:00,057
Yeah.
Cooper's.

270
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:01,517
We could go there.
Kelly's.

271
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,018
Sure.
Brixx's.

272
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,436
Yes. Yes.
Carmen's.

273
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,813
Fort, Andy Gavin's.
I have a new place.

274
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,358
It must have
just opened up.

275
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,193
Yeah, recently.

276
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,445
Yeah. All right.
All right.

277
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,281
All right, enough
of this Christmas crap.

278
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,450
Let's just get some
party music. Yeah!

279
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,244
Yeah, there you go.

280
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:21,537
Yeah!

281
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,579
That's good.

282
00:15:22,664 --> 00:15:25,123
Yeah, that's better.
Party girl.

283
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,376
Hey, Sasha, it's Daddy.

284
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,879
Have you ever heard of
this doll Princess Unicorn?

285
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,049
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy...
Nope, no, no.

286
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,261
No. I'm just curious
if you heard of it.

287
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:41,473
This is great. My ex-wife's
going to be so pissed.

288
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,644
For once,
Daddy's going to be a hero.

289
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,440
$200.
Yep.

290
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:53,860
Hey, I'd like to buy
one of your dolls.

291
00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:55,571
Oh, that's my last one.

292
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,197
Oh, no.

293
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,450
No, no. I was going
to buy that doll.

294
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:01,660
Thanks, man.

295
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,620
I was going to
get the doll.

296
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:07,291
Not my problem.
But I...

297
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:10,210
I promised my daughter.
Darryl, look, hey...

298
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:14,006
I need the doll.
I need the doll.

299
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,258
I'm begging you.
I just...

300
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,678
I need it more than anything in the world.
I need this doll.

301
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:21,930
Darryl, man,
I need this doll.

302
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,183
Okay, all right, man.
Don't cry. It's cool.

303
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,521
I'll let you
get it for $400.

304
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,107
I only have two.

305
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,984
You can owe me.

306
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,528
Oh, man. Thanks. Thanks.

307
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:44,661
Thank you. I know, right?
Merry Christmas.

308
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:47,164
Oh, thanks.
She's going to...

309
00:16:47,248 --> 00:16:48,582
Oh.

310
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,711
Something wrong
with the doll?

311
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,047
No, it's...

312
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:59,718
It's even better
than the one I wanted.

313
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:10,812
Sunrise Rehab? No! No!

314
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,731
No! I told you no!
Yes.

315
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:14,816
There is no way!
No. It's okay.

316
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,193
It's all right.
No way! There is no way!

317
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:18,111
Meredith, we're doing this
for your own good.

318
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:19,988
Okay, come on.
No way!

319
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,032
There is no way! Here we go.
This is going to be good.

320
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:23,700
It's going to be...
No way! I told you.

321
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:24,826
We talked about this!

322
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,328
Open the door. There
is absolutely no way!

323
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,788
Here we go.
No, no way!

324
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,748
No! There is no way! No!

325
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,792
No! I am not going in there!
All right. Here we go.

326
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,043
Yes, you are.
I am not going in there!

327
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,294
Yes, you are!

328
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:36,088
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute,

329
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:39,091
wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

330
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:41,343
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just wait.
Calm down, calm down.

331
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,138
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

332
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,766
No! No!

333
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,521
Come on!
No! No!

334
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,689
There is no way!
Here we go.

335
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:54,856
There is no way!
Almost at the door.

336
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,358
Here's the door. There is no way!
There is no way!

337
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,527
No! No!
Let's start meeting...

338
00:17:58,611 --> 00:17:59,903
No!
Hello.

339
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,446
This man is crazy!
How are you?

340
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:02,698
This man is crazy!
Can I help you?

341
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:05,242
I have a deposit, alcoholic.
No! No! No!

342
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:08,120
So do I sign?
No!

343
00:18:08,746 --> 00:18:11,164
I need you to put the
Christmas tree back up.

344
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:12,374
It's outside.

345
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,500
I didn't ask you
where it was.

346
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:16,086
I told you where
it needs to be.

347
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,338
Shut up.

348
00:18:18,423 --> 00:18:19,631
Excuse me?

349
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,384
I'm not moving the tree.
Face it.

350
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,927
The only power
you have over me

351
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:27,055
is this little secret that I
know you're not going to tell.

352
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,515
Oh, and you want
to know how I know that?

353
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,102
Because then you won't be able to plan
your stupid, tacky parties anymore.

354
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,979
So you move the tree.

355
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,237
Okay.

356
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:51,246
Angela's having sex
with Dwight.

357
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:58,462
I caught them doing it
after Toby's going-away party.

358
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:05,969
Well, don't look
so surprised.

359
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,097
I knew it.
You did not know it.

360
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,808
I knew some of it.
Everyone knew some of it.

361
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,852
It's Christmas.

362
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,730
You knew it.
Thank you.

363
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:18,774
I knew it.
She knew it.

364
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:23,695
As it turns out, you can't just check
someone into rehab against their will.

365
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,072
They have to
do it voluntarily.

366
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,825
They have to hit rock bottom.

367
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,369
So I think I know what I
need to do at this point.

368
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:36,208
I need to find ways to push
Meredith to the bottom.

369
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:41,588
Um, I think I can do it.
I did it with Jan.

370
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:46,676
All right, everybody's
still here, perfect!

371
00:19:46,761 --> 00:19:49,221
I've got a little surprise
I've been working on.

372
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:52,307
Angela, my bride,
I just wanted you to know

373
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:57,187
that for the rest of our lives,
no matter the cultural milieu,

374
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,651
I will always be there to bring
you some Christmas cheer.

375
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:07,280
Deck the halls with boughs of
holly Fa la la la la, la la la la

376
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:12,577
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la

377
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:17,582
Don we now our gay apparel
Fa la la, la la la

378
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:22,587
Troll the little
old yuletide carol

379
00:20:36,894 --> 00:20:39,187
I think I'd like to
go home now.

380
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,397
Sure.

381
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,193
Tough room.

382
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,488
Come on,
I just learned it.

383
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:51,700
Just so you know, protocol is a
little round of applause, but...

384
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:55,912
"Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night."
