1
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:26,167
All right, everybody, this is
your last meal, so eat up.

2
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,463
From this point forward,
you will not use the bathroom.

3
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:33,550
We need to keep our starting
weights high so we can lose more.

4
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,260
This summer,
corporate is sponsoring

5
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:37,554
a little weight loss contest
between the branches.

6
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:41,182
Whichever branch
loses the most weight

7
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,809
gets three extra
vacation days.

8
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:44,727
What should we do
with all these leftovers?

9
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,396
I'm taking the dumplings
for my wife.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,022
No, no, no. This
is your last meal.

11
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:49,566
There will be no leftovers.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,526
I can bring
these to my shelter.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,111
I'm taking my dumplings.

14
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,823
There. Take those
home to your wife.

15
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:00,076
Dwight! Dwight!

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
Michael, it's time.

17
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:03,204
Hit the scales, everybody.

18
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:06,791
Right on that black platform.
This way. Step it up.

19
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:08,209
Don't go breaking my scale.

20
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,753
I'm excited to lose
weight for the wedding,

21
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,590
because I really want
to have washboard abs

22
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,758
the first time
Angela sees me naked.

23
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:19,262
Ex-squeeze me.

24
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:22,265
No, I will ex-squeeze you.

25
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,183
Okay, everybody,
get used to this,

26
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:27,312
because we are going to be
standing here briefly

27
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:29,439
every Monday for the
next seven Mondays.

28
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,774
Wait a minute. One more
bite of éclair each.

29
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,819
Hold it in your mouth
if you can't swallow.

30
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,782
Really? Nothing?

31
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,368
2,336 pounds.

32
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:45,079
You all need to learn
some portion control.

33
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:47,582
Wait a minute,
Pam is on the scale.

34
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:50,918
Pam-cake, no, no, no. We would
love your extra poundage,

35
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:55,089
but you are going to be leaving
us next week, so vamoose!

36
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,635
Okay. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder
Mifflin family only.

37
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,969
Family only.

38
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:03,056
All right, got it.
2,210 pounds.

39
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:12,482
Pam, you weigh 226 pounds?

40
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,900
Almost, Kevin.

41
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,818
Not almost, though, Holly.

42
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,112
I mean, not...
Not close to 200.

43
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:19,364
Math is hard.

44
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,573
Yeah.

45
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:22,909
Just...
We'll, just keep going.

46
00:02:27,206 --> 00:02:29,582
I'm totally going to slaughter
at the weigh-in today.

47
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,708
All I had this
weekend to eat

48
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,543
was a chicken breast
and a case of Diet Coke.

49
00:02:32,628 --> 00:02:33,628
Really?
Yeah.

50
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:36,381
'Cause I haven't eaten
anything since noon on Friday.

51
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:39,175
Okay. Stanley, come on.

52
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,468
Oh, I forgot
something in my car.

53
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:41,678
I'll see you guys up there.

54
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,096
All right.

55
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,810
I happen to be losing weight
on my own for my own reasons.

56
00:02:48,894 --> 00:02:53,690
The truth is, I have lost a little
of my speed, a little of my fire.

57
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,400
Here's what I
used to look like.

58
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,026
Look at those biceps.

59
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:00,613
We were fighting the power
and eating whatever we wanted.

60
00:03:00,906 --> 00:03:05,785
And arch your back and
slowly bring up your head.

61
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,666
Jimbo. Oh. They
moved the shower.

62
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,751
Did you see Holly's butt?

63
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:15,253
No, I didn't.

64
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,755
You know why?
Why?

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,384
Because most of the time, friends don't
talk about other friends' butts.

66
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,761
I... I know.

67
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:25,388
But what have you
learned about her?

68
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:28,516
I learned that she broke her
left leg twice in one year.

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,561
I learned that she's
allergic to sesame seeds.

70
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:35,148
I learned that she has read
Lonesome Dove three times.

71
00:03:35,232 --> 00:03:36,232
Nice.

72
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,569
And that her butt
refuses to quit.

73
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,154
Well, I tried.

74
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:46,159
You have to... You have to agree with me.
That's insane.

75
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:48,327
I'll just go later. That's insane.
I thought you had to pee.

76
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,923
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a
great Bikram class in Dickson City.

77
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:02,675
Oh, thanks.
I should check that out.

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,763
Also, and no pressure,
the teacher, he's a catch.

79
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,181
Actually, I'm a lesbian.

80
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:09,432
I'm gay.

81
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,934
I'm not a lesbian.

82
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,479
I don't know why I said that.
Stupid joke.

83
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:16,230
What's the joke?

84
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,024
No, there is no joke.

85
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:21,903
I just said it because I
haven't had much luck lately

86
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:23,821
and I'm not really
looking to date,

87
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:26,365
so maybe I should
switch to women.

88
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:29,160
You think it's a choice?

89
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:34,540
I'm going to head back to
my work area and just...

90
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,751
I'm messing
with you, Holly.

91
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:39,420
I knew that.

92
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:40,838
Okay, bye.
Okay.

93
00:04:40,923 --> 00:04:42,340
So you have the directions?
Yeah.

94
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:43,466
You have a toothbrush?
Yes.

95
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,592
You have a cell
phone charger?

96
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:45,635
I have everything.

97
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,970
Tomorrow, I start a
three-month design program

98
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,097
at the Pratt Institute
in New York.

99
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:52,975
I will be a little
fish in the Big Apple.

100
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,770
What up, two-one-two?

101
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:57,647
Fax this for me.

102
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,649
Come on, man. She goes to New
York in, like, 10 minutes.

103
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,944
It's not going to take her
10 minutes to fax it, Jim.

104
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:04,570
If I don't see
you again, goodbye.

105
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:07,031
Well, actually, I'll see you when
you give me the fax confirmation.

106
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:09,534
So never mind.

107
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,746
Ang... ela.

108
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,666
Ela, ela, ela

109
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,835
Under my Angerela

110
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,504
Ela, ela, eh, eh

111
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:22,630
What?

112
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,215
Hey, check it out.

113
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,676
This is The Breakers,
Newport, Rhode Island.

114
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,429
Huge, awesome, gorgeous mansion
overlooking the Atlantic.

115
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:33,224
And my dad went to Cornell with
the current groundskeeper.

116
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:38,271
Every little boy fantasizes
about his fairytale wedding.

117
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,023
No. No.

118
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,192
This is where my parents
decided not to get divorced.

119
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,527
I don't care.
Okay.

120
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,321
How do you feel
about Maine?

121
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,451
I'm on it. I'll see
you later, love.

122
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:14,098
We done good in there,
half-pint.

123
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:16,058
Well, that was the last time, Dwight.
I mean it.

124
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,894
Monkey.
No. No.

125
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,146
I have a fiancé
I very much like.

126
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:30,990
Hey! Hey!

127
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:51,844
Pam! Pam! Hey.

128
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:53,888
What happened?

129
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,097
I wrote you
a goodbye poem.

130
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,434
It's really long. I left
it up in my office.

131
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,936
Could you just please
wait until I go get it?

132
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,978
I should really get going.

133
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:03,522
No. Okay. Okay.

134
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,027
The last word is "seagulls."

135
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:10,112
I'm sure it was
really lovely.

136
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,656
I took a lot from other poems.

137
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:15,493
Call me when you get in.
Okay.

138
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,619
Bye.
Bye.

139
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,662
All right, call...

140
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:19,038
No, Michael.

141
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,628
Why haven't I
proposed yet?

142
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:29,340
Actually, Pam and I talked about it.
And we just decided that,

143
00:07:29,424 --> 00:07:32,259
well, we didn't want to spend the first
three months of our engagement apart.

144
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:35,012
And Pam's always said she
doesn't want a long engagement.

145
00:07:35,097 --> 00:07:37,390
Something in her past,
I guess.

146
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:38,724
Not really sure
of the whole story,

147
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:41,894
but something about a guy
who used to work here.

148
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,356
Okay. No, no, no, no, no!
Same places as last week.

149
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,816
It doesn't matter, Michael.
Yes, it does.

150
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,610
No, this is about
weight displacement.

151
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:51,153
We have to have the same
weight distribution.

152
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,989
Right here.
There we go.

153
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,241
Let's move that up.
There we go.

154
00:07:55,826 --> 00:07:57,743
Fancy meeting you here.

155
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,914
Okay, everybody smile.

156
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:08,838
You lost 31 pounds.

157
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,840
Hey!
Yeah!

158
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:12,925
All right!
Yes!

159
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,260
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

160
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:17,847
but Michael is actually
killing it with Holly.

161
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:22,184
And I think I know why. It's because
Holly is kind of a major dork.

162
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,897
I'm MC Mike Scott and I am hot

163
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:29,275
She's DJ Jazzy Flax
and she is the best

164
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,861
All the sucker branches
can suck our fat

165
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,447
Wicka-wicka-wicka what?

166
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:42,955
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Ronni.

167
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,166
I don't
really know Ronni.

168
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,501
But I have a feeling I will
get to know her very well

169
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,670
over the next few years.

170
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:52,131
And eventually
declare my love for her.

171
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:58,554
Sorry I'm late. I accidently
switched my alarm clock setting

172
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,389
to Zapf Chancery.

173
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:04,727
Which is my terrible
segue into our course,

174
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,980
Expressive Typography
in New Media.

175
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,650
I'm in the wrong class.

176
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:15,196
Some of you may remember from last
semester, I am Professor Monahan.

177
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,115
And it looks like I'm
boring someone already.

178
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,493
No, I just...
Please sit down.

179
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:33,506
You're shaking.
Are you all right?

180
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,508
Just leave me alone!

181
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,761
I am on the third day
of my cleanse diet.

182
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,180
All I have to do
is drink maple syrup,

183
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:44,892
lemon juice, cayenne pepper and
water for all three meals.

184
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,854
I just bought some bikinis
online, size two. So...

185
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,274
Gonna look amazing!

186
00:09:58,115 --> 00:09:59,532
Hi, can I help you?

187
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:01,951
I need you to make me 100 copies
of this on canary yellow.

188
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,077
Hey, Jan.
Hi.

189
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:04,453
How's the candle game?

190
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,788
Oh, great. Yeah.

191
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:09,166
Serenity by Jan is kicking
ass and taking names.

192
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,877
You remember last week
when that girl went missing,

193
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:14,088
guess whose candles
they used for the vigil?

194
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:17,466
Cool. Thank God
they found her, too.

195
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,635
Oh, they found her?
Hi, Jan.

196
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,804
Hello, baby. How are you?

197
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,931
Good to see you.
Who's your daddy?

198
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,683
You don't know who
your daddy is, do you?

199
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,643
No, you don't. Come on.
Let's go in.

200
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,728
When Michael told us
that Jan was pregnant,

201
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:32,565
he led us to believe
that he was the father,

202
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:35,234
by telling us that
he was the father.

203
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,444
Hey, Oscar.

204
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:40,614
Who's that woman in Michael's
office with the feet?

205
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:42,199
That's his ex.

206
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,869
Oh. She's very beautiful.

207
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:47,955
Yeah, she is.
And clinically insane.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,961
So, listen, I don't know if your
offer still stands or whatever,

209
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,714
but you can give your
yoga teacher my number.

210
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:57,798
Okay.

211
00:10:57,883 --> 00:10:59,175
Listen, dummy,
it's not that hard.

212
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,178
All you have to do is take the
numbers from the sales report

213
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,221
and type them into
a master spreadsheet.

214
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:07,474
A GD monkey could do it. I do not
understand why you can't do it!

215
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,395
No! You do not
talk to him like that!

216
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:13,230
But he's an idiot.
Hey.

217
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:15,024
He is not an idiot.

218
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,108
Thank you, Holly.

219
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:18,110
He is mentally challenged.

220
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,614
But he's doing
a super job here.

221
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,115
Wait, back up.

222
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,620
Do you think
that I'm retarded?

223
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:32,958
What... No. Dwight.

224
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:37,463
Oh, Holly,
that is very offensive.

225
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:38,839
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,730
Hey, so,

227
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:59,401
since my little lady has such particular,
impossible-to-perceive taste,

228
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,403
I've made
non-refundable deposits

229
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,864
at four totally different
wedding locales.

230
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:06,575
Hot air balloons
over Napa Valley,

231
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,411
world famous Walt Disney's
Epcot Center,

232
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:11,622
scuba diving
wedding in the Bahamas

233
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:14,333
and Wilkes-Barre
Marriott Ballroom C.

234
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:18,879
Dangerous, tacky,
sharks, haunted. No.

235
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,049
Hurry, we have to
make this fast.

236
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,842
Let's do this thing!

237
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:24,927
Hey!

238
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,264
I have a nice comforter
and several cozy pillows.

239
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,892
I usually read a chapter of a
book and it's lights-out by 8:30.

240
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:34,019
That's how I sleep at night.

241
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,480
All right, I am connecting.

242
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:40,025
And you are not there.

243
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:42,736
Did you install it right?

244
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,196
How about this?
Go to applications...

245
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:47,241
I can see you!

246
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:49,535
All right!
This is so cool!

247
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:51,996
So what is going on,
girl in the computer?

248
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,789
Lunch with a girl from my hall.
Uh-huh.

249
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,667
Ceramics class,
then dinner by myself.

250
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:58,627
I'm going to watch HGTV,

251
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,088
and maybe go to Bungalow 8
with John Mayer.

252
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:02,673
Okay, can you turn the
girl off, please?

253
00:13:02,757 --> 00:13:03,799
I'm trying to
get some work done.

254
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,970
No way! No way!
Pam Beesly! Hello!

255
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:09,305
Hey!

256
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,723
Hey, everybody, look! Pam!

257
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:12,391
Pam! Say hi!
Say hi to Pam!

258
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,600
Hi, Pam.

259
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:15,185
Don't we
all look skinny?

260
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,771
Almost dropped you.

261
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:19,481
Can you put me down?
I'm getting a little nauseous.

262
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,568
Pam, I would like you
to meet Ronni.

263
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:24,737
We call her
"Rice-a-Ronni."

264
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:27,364
She is hilarious,
she is wonderful,

265
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:31,493
a beam of light in this
dark, dark office.

266
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,288
Not really so much.

267
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,876
All she does is plop herself down
there and answer phones all day.

268
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,127
The nerve.

269
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:43,297
Calm down, weirdo. Just a joke.
She's such a weirdo.

270
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:45,674
You know what? My real beef
with her, though, Pam,

271
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,426
is that she can't
find those little

272
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,178
colored paperclips
that I like so much.

273
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,554
Would you help her
find them, please?

274
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:52,014
They're on the supply shelf.

275
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:53,307
Let's go!
Yeah.

276
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:56,185
We are following Pam
to the supply shelf.

277
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,270
Let us go.

278
00:13:58,646 --> 00:14:00,147
New York is so exciting.

279
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:02,816
I love my classes.
The city is awesome.

280
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:07,571
Can you give me
back to Jim now please?

281
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,200
Okay, everybody,
let's suck in our guts.

282
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,039
2,184 pounds for a grand...

283
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,541
Oh. You all gained
five pounds back.

284
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:20,959
Damn it. Come on!

285
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:25,297
Oh, my God.

286
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,139
- Come on, Bernard.
- Here we go.

287
00:14:34,224 --> 00:14:35,516
- Move it.
- Everybody on.

288
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,558
All right, we're set.

289
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,228
Still good.
You guys lost a pound.

290
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,980
You lost one pound.

291
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,150
I was on an IV for two
days at the hospital.

292
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:46,693
I lost four pounds.

293
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,404
I don't know what those
other fools were doing,

294
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,905
but I lost four pounds.

295
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,074
Angela, you'll
go to the supermarket

296
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,909
and get the
New York cheesecake.

297
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,911
Make sure it's
the generic one.

298
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,663
It's Stanley's favorite.

299
00:14:58,915 --> 00:15:02,751
Yes, I've replaced Angela as head
of the Party Planning Committee.

300
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:06,380
I guess I was just in the right
place at the right time.

301
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,173
How's it going?

302
00:15:08,258 --> 00:15:10,092
- It's going well.
- Good.

303
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,802
I have a crazy idea.

304
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:15,055
What if we did fruit
instead of cake?

305
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,141
Cake?
Who suggested cake?

306
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:20,644
We lost weight today.
I think it's okay

307
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:22,604
to reward ourselves
once in a while.

308
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,981
Are you kidding me?

309
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:25,983
We only lost
one pound, Phyllis.

310
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:28,485
What is wrong
with these people?

311
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:31,363
They have no willpower.
I went...

312
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:36,118
I once went 28 years
without having sex.

313
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:40,164
And then again
for seven years.

314
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,083
Does anyone have any idea

315
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:46,753
what the number one cause of
death is in this country?

316
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:48,797
Shotgun weddings.
That's not what that is.

317
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,132
Fright.
Being scared to death.

318
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,341
No.

319
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:53,302
Obesity-caused illnesses.
Obesity-caused illnesses.

320
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,095
Thank you.
Holly is right.

321
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,475
People, this is not just about
winning some extra vacation days.

322
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:05,564
This is about a very cool HR
initiative that if we don't follow

323
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:08,150
we are all going
to die of obesity.

324
00:16:09,027 --> 00:16:10,152
So how much are
we going to lose?

325
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,945
I would like to
lose 65 pounds.

326
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,740
Yes! All right. Who else?

327
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:17,034
Angela, can I put you
down for 10 pounds?

328
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:19,286
No. My doctor wants me
to gain weight.

329
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,121
If you gain weight,
you will die.

330
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:24,291
I want you to live forever.
I want us all to live forever.

331
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,667
How? How are we
going to do this?

332
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:28,212
Cryogenics.
Beer me five.

333
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,005
This is how
we're going to do it.

334
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,883
Five pounds. I'm asking each
of you to lose five pounds.

335
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:35,844
That, plus Jim's 65,

336
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,096
give us a very good chance
at winning this thing.

337
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,183
All right, I'm taking off.

338
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,477
Booty call.
No, just going to see Pam.

339
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:46,104
Maybe put up some shelves.
Here. Wait a second.

340
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:51,985
I don't want you to end up with
a surprise pregnancy like me.

341
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,863
Okay. Thank you for this.

342
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,698
You want more?
No.

343
00:16:58,368 --> 00:17:02,329
I don't know if there's any one
place that has all these things.

344
00:17:02,497 --> 00:17:03,956
That's not my problem.

345
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,668
"Thousand-year-old church in
the continental United States.

346
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,086
"There has to be a rainbow,

347
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,337
"24 hour
veterinarian on call."

348
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:12,881
That is very
important to me.

349
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,467
So, I have work to do.
Just do it.

350
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,679
Sweetheart,

351
00:17:20,098 --> 00:17:23,350
just so you know, I don't
care where we get married.

352
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,686
I'll marry you right
here in this building.

353
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,271
I'll marry you
in the parking lot.

354
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:31,942
I'll marry you in the eye of a hurricane
in the middle of a snow storm

355
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:33,819
on top of a monsoon.

356
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,156
All I care about is
that we're going to

357
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:41,326
spend the rest of
our lives together.

358
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,920
I know I haven't
made this easy on you.

359
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,566
Hold on.

360
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,318
Hi.
Hi.

361
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:26,496
Oh. So rude of me. Have
you seen Pam's new art?

362
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,999
It's right there.
Check it out.

363
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,391
It's a pretty lame party.

364
00:18:46,476 --> 00:18:48,518
Does anyone want to dance?

365
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,282
Some girl came into Pam's room

366
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,744
crying about her roommate
stealing her soy milk.

367
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,163
So I'm in here
waiting it out.

368
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:10,832
Stanley, Michael's not here.

369
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,751
You can eat a slice
of your birthday cake.

370
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,670
I don't like cake anymore.

371
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,129
Why not, dawg?

372
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:19,925
Taste changed.
Now all I like is baklava.

373
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:23,387
Michael, we have a situation!

374
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,184
They should not
be in that room.

375
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,686
That's so lame.
They didn't invite us.

376
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,020
You know what we should do?

377
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,563
We should have a party
and not invite them.

378
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:36,191
Yeah.
Let's go mini-golfing.

379
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,275
Yeah?

380
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,196
Oh, hey, could I have a rain
check on the mini-golf?

381
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,615
I actually have
a date tonight.

382
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:49,371
It'll probably be
a total disaster, but...

383
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:54,835
I think you'll have fun because
men from Scranton are handsome

384
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,379
and they know how to show
a woman a good time.

385
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,964
Not that guy who
murdered his mother.

386
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:01,299
He was not so handsome.

387
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,051
Also Kevin.
You know what?

388
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:04,219
We're pretty much
done here today.

389
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,887
Why don't you
just take off early?

390
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:06,930
Really?
Yeah.

391
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:08,098
That's sweet.

392
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,559
Wish me luck.
Good luck.

393
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,977
Hey.

394
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:13,311
Holly doesn't need luck.

395
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:16,064
Everyone that meets her
instantly loves her.

396
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,151
Party's over!
You're so busted!

397
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:21,111
Okay, everybody.

398
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:24,114
Phyllis, did I or did
I not say fruit?

399
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:25,240
You said fruit, Michael.

400
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,159
And what is that?

401
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:28,285
Cake.

402
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,495
You know, we're going to have
to try a little bit harder

403
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,789
if we are going
to win this thing.

404
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:34,833
Happy birthday, Stanley!

405
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,091
It's kind of a good news,
bad news situation.

406
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,385
The bad news is,
we're not doing very well,

407
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,597
so we really had to starve
ourselves this whole week.

408
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:50,724
But the good news is that
all the other branches

409
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,517
are doing just
as bad as we are,

410
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:55,520
so corporate upped
the prize to five days.

411
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:57,355
So if we stay fat long enough,

412
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,858
we may actually get
a whole month off.

413
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,909
What?
Oh, nothing.

414
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,204
It's just some of us are
taking this really seriously.

415
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,498
I swallowed
a tapeworm last night.

416
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:16,625
It's going to grow up to
three feet inside of me

417
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,336
and then it eats all my food
so that I don't get fat.

418
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,131
And then after three months, I take
some medicine and then I pass it.

419
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:25,884
Creed sold it to me.
It's from Mexico.

420
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:28,053
That wasn't a tapeworm.

421
00:21:30,807 --> 00:21:33,099
How's my favorite
branch doing?

422
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:38,605
All right.

423
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,945
Ronni was...

424
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,156
Things were at
an all-time sad here.

425
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,825
But then I got
an e-mail from Ryan

426
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,203
that he was coming back to town.
And I called the temp agency

427
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:56,873
and I told them, "I will pay you any
amount. Just give me Ryan Howard.

428
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,459
"Give him to me.
I want him. I need him."

429
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,919
And you got a goatee.

430
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:02,003
I did.

431
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,756
Did you get that after you
helped me move and you saw mine?

432
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,551
Yes. Goatee!

433
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:10,428
Fired guy!

434
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:11,805
Hey, Kevin.

435
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,015
That's really funny.
Yeah.

436
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,725
It's great to see you, Kev.
You, too.

437
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,478
I'm keeping a list of
everyone who wrongs me.

438
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:21,398
So when I'm back on top,
they'll be sorry.

439
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:22,899
Kevin just made the list.

440
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:24,568
Jim!

441
00:22:26,237 --> 00:22:29,781
I want to apologize for how
I treated you last year.

442
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:34,619
I lost sight of myself and now
that I've quit the rat race,

443
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:36,037
I realize there's
so much more to life

444
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:39,082
than being the youngest VP
in the company's history.

445
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:43,670
I've even started volunteering,
giving back to the community.

446
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:45,422
That's great.

447
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,383
You're talking about your
court-ordered community service?

448
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,219
I don't need a judge to tell
me to keep my community clean.

449
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:53,054
But he did, right?

450
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,015
All right.
All right.

451
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,691
Well, you lost zero pounds.
No change.

452
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:06,401
On the brighter side,
you gained zero pounds.

453
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,071
Hey, you know what? I can't
do this by myself, people!

454
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:13,909
Kelly and I are the only ones who've
either passed out or almost passed out!

455
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,327
Damn it,
I need these five days

456
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,245
for my honeymoon!
Who is slacking?

457
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,664
Okay, let's just all try
and work harder, okay?

458
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:21,374
No! I want names!

459
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:25,837
This is the hardest thing I've
ever had to do in my entire life.

460
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:29,341
I haven't had
a very hard life.

461
00:23:30,134 --> 00:23:31,259
So how was your date?

462
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:32,552
8.5.

463
00:23:32,637 --> 00:23:34,930
I got a red wine stain
on my favorite shirt.

464
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,681
But he's cute, right?

465
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,185
What's wrong?

466
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:47,859
Mmm...

467
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:51,696
Um...

468
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,532
Close the door.

469
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:58,620
This is your fault.
No.

470
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,580
Your stupid friend zone.

471
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:04,459
I should have been lovers with
her first and then friends.

472
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,253
That was terrible advice.
Terrible advice!

473
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:09,172
You know my seduction method.

474
00:24:09,256 --> 00:24:12,050
I like to get in there
and get my hands dirty.

475
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:13,635
You sabotaged me.

476
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,178
You sabotaged me, man!

477
00:24:15,763 --> 00:24:18,306
Attention! Attention!

478
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:20,475
We only have a few weeks left

479
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,187
and most of you are just as
fat as the day we began.

480
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:25,855
How much weight
have you lost, Dwight?

481
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,023
I am hardly the problem, Jim.

482
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:28,149
No, you're
definitely the problem.

483
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:32,821
This is what I'm going to do. I'm
going to randomly select three names

484
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,865
and these three people
will get liposuction.

485
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,492
Um...

486
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,247
Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be
responsible for your own medical bills.

487
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,458
Kelly?

488
00:24:45,543 --> 00:24:48,294
Hello, Ryan. You look well.

489
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:52,173
I wanted to say I'm sorry for treating
you bad the past couple of years.

490
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:57,095
I was in my mid-20s and I was
going through a lot of stuff.

491
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,306
I think I never
really processed 9/11.

492
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:02,434
I want you to know
I've changed.

493
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:03,560
Cool.

494
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:06,688
We should get a drink
later, catch up.

495
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,106
Pick me up around 8:00?

496
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:10,650
That is so sweet.

497
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:15,613
Um, but I'm dating Darryl still and
we're like crazy in love, so...

498
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,200
Cool.

499
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:24,539
Well, maybe I'll
see you around.

500
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,207
It's a small office.

501
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,417
Yeah.

502
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,466
Hey, Phyllis,
do you have a minute?

503
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,678
Listen, I'm really sorry
about what I said before.

504
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,263
Okay?

505
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,640
I was way out of line.

506
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:44,642
Yes, you were.

507
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:47,395
But you know what?
I want to make it up to you.

508
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,900
There is a surefire sale, but
it's a two-man job. Interested?

509
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,780
Split the commission?

510
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,075
Sixty-forty.

511
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:04,120
I'll drive.

512
00:26:20,137 --> 00:26:23,473
Dieting is only half of it.
Mmm-hmm. Saunas.

513
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,100
And exercise.

514
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,061
Although I know everybody
loves going to the gym.

515
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:29,729
The dreadmill.

516
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:36,111
Probably the weirdest thing about Pam
being gone will be lunch, actually.

517
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,364
But it will force me
to become acquaintances

518
00:26:39,448 --> 00:26:42,367
with people I
consider co-workers.

519
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,203
Oh, my God.

520
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,956
Okay, everybody just act normal.
Don't say anything.

521
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,998
What?

522
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,209
My ex-girlfriend,
she's right behind you.

523
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:52,794
Really? Where?
Just hide me.

524
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,587
No, no, don't look.

525
00:26:55,965 --> 00:26:58,007
Wow, was it
the age difference?

526
00:26:58,092 --> 00:26:59,509
Actually, kind of, yes.

527
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:02,137
I just didn't like
eating dinner that early.

528
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:09,144
Hey, Jim. Listen, can I call
you back in a little bit?

529
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,812
I made friends.

530
00:27:14,942 --> 00:27:16,484
Are you insane?
Hey, hey.

531
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,694
What happened?

532
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:19,237
There was no client.

533
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:21,739
Dwight drove me to an abandoned
warehouse five miles away

534
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:24,117
and pushed me out of the car.

535
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,828
I had to walk home
with no money and no phone.

536
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,914
And you burned over a thousand
calories walking home,

537
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:34,335
and this branch just got a little
bit closer to winning the contest.

538
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,837
Phyllis Vance,
ladies and gentlemen.

539
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,548
You left me in
a bad part of town.

540
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:41,926
Yeah, I took your purse.
What are you worried about?

541
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:44,846
You look great.

542
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,390
I can definitely
see the difference.

543
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:49,601
Phyllis Vance
for David Wallace.

544
00:27:52,688 --> 00:27:54,314
"Dunder Mifflin
wants to make it clear

545
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:56,858
"that Dunder Mifflin
does not discriminate

546
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,402
"nor does it condone
unhealthy dieting habits

547
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:01,529
"or extreme
weight loss strategies,

548
00:28:01,614 --> 00:28:03,531
"as was clearly
stated in the official..."

549
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:07,535
Oh, bang, boom,
shake, klump!

550
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,538
Why, hello, everybody.

551
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:13,166
What are you doing?
Fair question.

552
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,628
I say, I say,
I say, sit down, Holly!

553
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,172
I'll take it from here.

554
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:22,800
I am beautiful.

555
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,264
They are beautiful.

556
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:36,439
He is beautiful. This big
fat pig is beautiful.

557
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,067
It's my sumo suit.

558
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,443
I just didn't
inflate it all the way.

559
00:28:40,527 --> 00:28:44,614
I'm so glad that
I bought instead of rented.

560
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,699
Body image.

561
00:28:47,785 --> 00:28:50,787
We are here because there is
something wrong with society.

562
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:53,164
See, you're always saying there's
something wrong with society,

563
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:55,291
but maybe there's
something wrong with you.

564
00:28:55,376 --> 00:28:58,086
If it's me, then society
made me that way.

565
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,088
Now, I know a lot of you are
probably asking yourself,

566
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:03,675
"Why are you dressed
in a plus-size suit?"

567
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:05,927
Because you're kind of doing
Michael Klump.

568
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,262
How do you know
Michael Klump?

569
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,389
Because it's your "making fun
of fat people" character.

570
00:29:09,473 --> 00:29:10,932
How dare you!

571
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:14,227
Michael Klump is a
celebration of fat people.

572
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:16,938
I think of him as
more like a monster.

573
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,691
What about, "I say, I say,
I say, I'll sit on you"?

574
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:23,486
No, no. It goes... Look. "I say,
I say, I say, I'll sit on you."

575
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,363
No! No! No! No! No!
You know what?

576
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:28,950
Fat people are not monsters.

577
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:32,912
Why don't you guys have a little
more sensitivity to the subject?

578
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:35,123
Bang, boom, case in point.

579
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,582
Look at the outside
of this building.

580
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,959
It is ugly.

581
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:41,587
But you come inside
and it is beautiful.

582
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,925
Just like this
unappealing fat suit.

583
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,596
Inside is a rather
handsome, sexy man.

584
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,681
Vamping.

585
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:54,183
Hey, why don't you
just sit down, please?

586
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:55,310
I've been sitting all day.

587
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,686
We're doing this
because of you.

588
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,772
So why don't you just
go stand somewhere else?

589
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,484
Hey, hey, shaved?

590
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,403
I did.
Why?

591
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:10,742
So in the year 2000,

592
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:15,705
fungus and even black mold was
discovered growing in the cave.

593
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,874
Some blame it on the new
air conditioning system

594
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,210
that was installed, some on
the high-powered lights.

595
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:23,504
Others feel that fungus
is due to an overgrowth...

596
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:27,675
Nice.
Quiet, please.

597
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,260
Sorry.
Sorry.

598
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,305
Dwight, I would like
you to apologize

599
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:34,307
to this beautiful,
beautiful woman

600
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:35,850
for forcing her
to walk five miles,

601
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,353
which, for her, is
basically a death march.

602
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:41,689
She should thank me. Okay,
Phyllis, thank Dwight first.

603
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:43,191
Why should I
have to thank him?

604
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,692
You're right. You're right!
Just... Dwight, do it.

605
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:45,985
Just say it, okay?

606
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,489
I apologize for creating a ruse
which forced you to exercise.

607
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:52,200
Finally. Right? Okay.

608
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,702
Phyllis, you must be exhausted
from standing on those gams.

609
00:30:54,787 --> 00:30:57,372
Why don't you have a seat?
Let's all clap at Phyllis.

610
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:02,960
Okay! Michael Klump wants to
remind you that corporate,

611
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,006
their idea, yes, was to
urge you to lose weight.

612
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:09,509
But more importantly, what
this whole thing is about,

613
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:12,136
this contest is
really about being healthy.

614
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:16,432
And in order to be healthy, you
have to eat. Kelly. Kelly...

615
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:22,605
Kelly, I want you to
stand up on your chair.

616
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,273
Come on. Stand up on
your chair. Stand up.

617
00:31:24,358 --> 00:31:27,402
Stand up. Stand up.
Somebody help her.

618
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,363
Here we go. Okay.
I want you to look at her.

619
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:33,116
She's a beautiful
Indian woman.

620
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,159
Why? What makes
her beautiful?

621
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:37,787
Everything. She's perfect.

622
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:38,871
I like her nails.

623
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:40,123
Okay, be more specific.

624
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:41,749
I like her fingernails.

625
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,251
I like her purple dress.

626
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,627
What about her looks?

627
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,003
Hell of an ass.

628
00:31:47,131 --> 00:31:48,506
What else do people like?

629
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,676
I wonder what
people like about me.

630
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,138
Probably my jugs.

631
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:58,057
Kelly, will you just agree
to stop this madness

632
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:00,643
and stop trying
to kill yourself?

633
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:02,812
I hate dieting.
I hate it so much.

634
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:04,939
I hate this
worm inside of me.

635
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,692
I want you to know...
Kelly, look at me.

636
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:10,361
I want you to know
that you are beautiful.

637
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:12,280
You are truly,
truly beautiful.

638
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:14,657
Give me a hug.

639
00:32:16,785 --> 00:32:17,910
Mmm...

640
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:19,829
Summer's going great.

641
00:32:19,913 --> 00:32:22,623
Just spent two hours
listening to Michael Klump.

642
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:26,586
I have a weird pain in my left side
that I'm convinced is an ulcer.

643
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,045
My girlfriend
lives in New York,

644
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,923
and I haven't
seen her in 10 days.

645
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:32,425
How's your summer?

646
00:32:40,476 --> 00:32:42,977
Hey, Ryan, look.
Shaved off my goatee.

647
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,230
I am goatee-less. We are
the goatee-less brothers.

648
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,441
Yep.

649
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,236
How was Friday night?

650
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,030
Oh, I had a good time.

651
00:32:54,114 --> 00:32:57,033
But it's been
three days and no call.

652
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:01,454
I even have two tickets to see
Counting Crows for tonight, so...

653
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:02,497
He'll call.

654
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,165
Oscar, enough of
the girl talk, please.

655
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:07,585
You guys lost four pounds. Hey.

656
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:08,836
I say we have a parade.

657
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:10,213
- Excellent.
- We better.

658
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:11,297
Good job.

659
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:15,218
So, as it turns out, tonight
is my nephew's tee ball game

660
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:17,887
and I kind of missed
the first three, so...

661
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:19,514
You've already
disappointed him so much.

662
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,390
He can't be expecting
a lot from you.

663
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:22,767
I know. I suck.

664
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:24,101
Yes, you do.

665
00:33:24,228 --> 00:33:25,186
Dwight says hi.

666
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,939
I do not.
I do not say hi, Pam.

667
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:29,190
He's saying hi louder.

668
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:32,235
All right, listen, we're still
good for this weekend, right?

669
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,446
No tee ball games, recitals,
karate tournaments.

670
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,033
Hey, can you go to IM?
Okay.

671
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,201
Okay.

672
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,626
What are you
writing about me?

673
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,764
I'm going to write you
both up for not working.

674
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:03,558
I'm going to write
you up for not working.

675
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:07,353
Okay. Well played.

676
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,941
Neither of us will write the
other up for not working.

677
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:41,012
Yeah? Oh, hey.
Did he call?

678
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:43,222
I just got... Kendall? I
just got off... No, no.

679
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:46,392
Did... I heard you talking
to Oscar about that guy.

680
00:34:46,476 --> 00:34:47,768
What... What happened?
Did he call?

681
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:49,061
Oh. No.

682
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:50,605
Really?
No.

683
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,231
And you know what?
I even got two tickets

684
00:34:52,316 --> 00:34:54,817
to see the Counting Crows
tonight as a surprise.

685
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:57,111
Why do guys not call when they
say they're going to call?

686
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:01,282
I don't know. I always call
everybody back right away.

687
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,408
But he'll call back, though.

688
00:35:02,492 --> 00:35:03,618
Give him until
the end of the day.

689
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,785
He'll call. He'll call.

690
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,872
If he doesn't, he is loco.

691
00:35:07,956 --> 00:35:10,124
Thanks. That's sweet.

692
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:15,588
Anyways, it seems like we lost
to Utica by only eight pounds.

693
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,966
Well, at least
everyone lost weight.

694
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,593
That's all that
really matters.

695
00:35:20,677 --> 00:35:23,596
Wait, could we have
till the end of the day?

696
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:27,642
So we're only eight
pounds behind Utica.

697
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,018
Now, I know it's a stretch,

698
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:32,229
but we could weigh ourselves
again at the end of the day

699
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:34,023
and maybe win
this thing after all.

700
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:35,691
Leave it to me, boss.

701
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:38,444
I can get this whole
office to make weight.

702
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:47,119
It's going to be
a little toasty in here.

703
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,580
Good old-fashioned
sweat lodge.

704
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,499
Andy Bernard does
not lose contests.

705
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,334
He wins them.

706
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:56,170
Or he quits them
because they're unfair.

707
00:36:01,218 --> 00:36:03,761
Hey, is that healthy food?

708
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:04,845
Nope.

709
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,099
We're trying to win a contest
here, Kelly. Please.

710
00:36:08,183 --> 00:36:10,142
Hey, Michael, I just scheduled
lunch with a client,

711
00:36:10,227 --> 00:36:11,602
so I might be back
a little late.

712
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:14,355
Okay, that is fine.

713
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,399
Just water and be back by weigh-in.
Okay?

714
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:17,692
Perfect.

715
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,368
I hate to even ask because
you've been so accommodating

716
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:31,122
about all the wedding stuff...
Your wish is my command.

717
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,668
Is there any way our first dance
can be to my favorite song?

718
00:36:35,752 --> 00:36:38,003
The Little Drummer Boy.

719
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:39,171
Of course.

720
00:36:39,256 --> 00:36:41,799
Really? Yeah! I mean,
it's a great song.

721
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,551
I always thought it was
bigger than Christmas,

722
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,219
anyway, you know?
Mmm-hmm.

723
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,554
And you know what?
The guys already know it,

724
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,722
so it's easy breezy.

725
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,056
The guys?

726
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,726
I didn't tell you.

727
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,686
Here Comes Treble,
class of '96,

728
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,229
was available
for our big day,

729
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,815
so I booked them.

730
00:36:57,899 --> 00:36:58,899
I don't think that...

731
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,235
And they're collectively
my best man.

732
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,781
And they're crashing with us for three
weeks, so it totally works out.

733
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:08,576
I don't know if I want your
old college a cappella group

734
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,703
to be our wedding band.

735
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:19,462
Okay, I hear you, sweetheart,
but this is a deal breaker.

736
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:26,469
But you know what? You're
going to love these guys.

737
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:31,932
Carl I, Carl II, Broccoli Rob,
Spare Rib, Doobie, Lunchbox.

738
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:34,143
Boner Champ, that's me,

739
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:38,689
Pubey Lewis and the News,
Hopscotch, Jingle Jangle, Sandwich.

740
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:42,401
These are the best best men
a guy could ever hope for.

741
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,405
Let's talk about
this later. Okay.

742
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,806
Hey, this is not halfway.

743
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,392
I did the math. I had to
drive way longer than you.

744
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:19,188
Montclair would have been closer,
so you have to buy lunch.

745
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:22,900
What are you doing?

746
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:26,570
I just can't wait.

747
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:27,947
Oh, my God.

748
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:33,327
Pam, will you marry me?

749
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:34,703
Oh, my God!

750
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:38,541
So?

751
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:40,960
Yes.

752
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:54,890
God! Where is Jim?

753
00:38:54,975 --> 00:38:56,559
I'm calling it.

754
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:59,144
I guess that's curtains
for the yoga guy.

755
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:00,187
Oh, really?

756
00:39:00,272 --> 00:39:01,272
Yeah.

757
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:04,024
I have to say, I think the
problem with that whole thing...

758
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,109
Yeah?

759
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:07,361
was that he was
a complete stupid idiot.

760
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:10,531
Oh, man, I really
wanted to see them.

761
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:11,657
I know.

762
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,033
I love...
I love Counting Crows.

763
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,077
Look where my seats were.

764
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:16,871
Wow! Really?
Yeah.

765
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:18,289
That's a shame.

766
00:39:19,165 --> 00:39:21,709
Shame to waste these.

767
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:25,296
I want to buy them from you.

768
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:29,008
Michael, you don't have to buy them.
I do. No...

769
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:32,636
I do. I... I want to.
Trust me, I really do.

770
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:35,389
Okay.

771
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,224
Okay?
Yeah.

772
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,601
All right.

773
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:41,061
All right.

774
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:48,986
Just... I want you to just forget
about him, okay? Case closed.

775
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:52,615
Can I pay you tomorrow?

776
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:55,576
I have like a $60
limit on my ATM, so...

777
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,870
Yeah.
Is that good?

778
00:39:57,954 --> 00:39:58,954
Hey. Sorry, everybody.

779
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,039
Hey, what are you
smiling about there,

780
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:02,374
smiley pants?
You're late.

781
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:03,709
Wet Tuna.

782
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,128
- Hey, Dwight.
- Okay.

783
00:40:06,212 --> 00:40:07,421
What's up, Meredith?
Nothing.

784
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,505
You're dripping on me.

785
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,007
Darryl,
would you do the honors?

786
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:11,800
2,175.

787
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:14,219
Sorry, guys.
No, no, no. No, no.

788
00:40:14,304 --> 00:40:15,846
I don't want to hear moaning.

789
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:17,306
This is a good day.

790
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,975
You guys accomplished
something big.

791
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,188
You lost a ton of weight,
literally, a lot of weight.

792
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:26,690
And I don't care what
any stupid scale says,

793
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:29,526
you guys are all
gigantic losers.

794
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,780
I don't know
about anyone else,

795
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,615
but it was
a good summer for me.

796
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,951
I lost seven pounds.

797
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,410
And you know what?

798
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:41,538
I'm just going to take
five days off anyway.

799
00:40:58,682 --> 00:41:02,601
I went zip lining my
third day in Costa Rica.

800
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:06,730
I guess the harness wasn't
strapped in exactly right.

801
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:09,900
I broke my neck. And...

802
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:14,238
I've been in the hospital
five weeks now.

803
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,242
I still haven't
seen the beach.

804
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,246
It's nice to have visitors.
