1
00:00:04,902 --> 00:00:07,070
Dunder Mifflin,
this is Pam.

2
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:09,155
I'm sorry,
he's not in yet.

3
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:11,366
Would you like
his voice-mail?

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,534
Yeah!

5
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:16,537
Yeah! Yeah! Okay.

6
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:20,166
Twelve miles an hour.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,251
Eat that, Carl Lewis!

8
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:25,588
Angela made several
911 calls about cars

9
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:27,590
going too fast in front
of the building,

10
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:30,009
so the police put up
a radar gun.

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,805
It's actually caused a
bit of a traffic hazard.

12
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:38,935
Wow, 13.

13
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:40,770
- No, no, no.
- Yeah!

14
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:42,647
There was wind.
I was just jogging.

15
00:00:42,731 --> 00:00:44,524
Dwight, there was wind.
I want a do over.

16
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:46,734
No, no, no, it's not your turn.
All right, 13 is the new number.

17
00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:47,860
Oscar, go ahead.

18
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:50,279
I want another try.
Here we go!

19
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,867
Thirty-one! 31!

20
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:56,035
There was a car.

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,287
I was ahead of the car.
Thirty-one is my new number.

22
00:00:58,372 --> 00:00:59,706
Thirty-one is
humanly impossible.

23
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,708
Go, Oscar.
Thirty-one is my number.

24
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,793
That's impossible.
Beat it!

25
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,817
Today's a big day. My
presence has been requested

26
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:33,322
by Chief Financial Officer,
David Wallace.

27
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:39,328
He says that he wants to talk
about big picture stuff,

28
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,750
and, I'll be honest, I have little
or no idea what that means.

29
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:46,335
So, probably bad.

30
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:50,798
Quick announcement.
New year, new candy.

31
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,135
Okay, be careful, Kevin.
They're kind of spicy.

32
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,470
Hot Tamales.

33
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:56,679
Yeah.
Uh-oh.

34
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:58,389
So maybe just try
one at first,

35
00:01:58,474 --> 00:02:00,933
and then if it's okay,
have a couple more.

36
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:04,187
Excuse me, everyone, can I
have the floor, please?

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,230
Um...

38
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,858
This is insanely awkward.

39
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:12,612
It's kind of the elephant
in the room, so I'll just...

40
00:02:14,448 --> 00:02:16,741
No one has RSVPed
to our wedding yet,

41
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,659
and the deadline
was yesterday.

42
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:20,828
Wait, you still
don't know...

43
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:22,914
No, no. No.

44
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:24,457
Hmm?

45
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:25,792
Nothing.
You still don't know...

46
00:02:25,876 --> 00:02:27,460
Why don't... Let's...
What are you doing?

47
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:29,712
How about we just... I just have
to talk to you for a second.

48
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:31,047
Andy. Has...
Ah.

49
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,049
No. No one has RSVPed,

50
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,551
and I don't understand it, and
now you're shutting me out.

51
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:38,513
You're not even listening, and that's
really considerate. Thank you.

52
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:39,806
No, what I'm saying...
No, no.

53
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,973
No, that's not...
I know...

54
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:44,894
Andy still doesn't know that Angela
is having an affair with Dwight.

55
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:48,022
And it's been 17 days.

56
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:50,024
I mean, eventually
he'll figure it out

57
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:53,653
when their kids have giant
heads and beet-stained teeth.

58
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,322
But right now,
it's just awkward.

59
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:58,825
How can
he still not know?

60
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:00,910
We can't figure that out.
I can't take it anymore.

61
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:02,620
Wait, what?
You can't take what?

62
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:03,746
I'm telling Andy,
Dwight.

63
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:04,914
No, you can't do that.
Yes.

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,916
It shouldn't come from you. Who
should it come from, then?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,042
Angela.
Angela.

66
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,752
From Angela.
Angela.

67
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,922
Are you still having
intercourse with her?

68
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:16,175
What is wrong with you?
She is engaged.

69
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,262
Did you ever have
intercourse in this office?

70
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:22,807
Are you serious?

71
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:25,768
Where?

72
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,646
Where?

73
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,150
Where, Dwight?

74
00:03:33,443 --> 00:03:35,903
Seems like you
already know where.

75
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:41,659
Kevin, you screwed
this form up again.

76
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,578
The amount owed
goes at the top.

77
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:46,038
Oh, I'm sorry.

78
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:49,000
I didn't realize I was
doing something wrong.

79
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:54,088
If I had, I would have admitted
it and stopped right away.

80
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:55,214
That's enough.

81
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:58,551
Because I wouldn't want
an innocent person

82
00:03:58,635 --> 00:04:01,470
who doesn't know anything
about the form...

83
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,225
What?

84
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,476
That was good.

85
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,146
It's just at the end you
weren't saying something

86
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,356
that could also
apply to the form.

87
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:13,566
How about,

88
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,194
"I'm sorry I did such a whorish
job filling out this form"?

89
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,738
There you go.

90
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,451
That cannot be true!

91
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:27,663
You're going to charge me
a fee to cut my own cake?

92
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,374
No, no, no, no.

93
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,876
What I'm saying is
I want to cut it myself.

94
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,002
Trade seats with me.

95
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,086
No.

96
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,880
I've got a better
angle on Pam.

97
00:04:35,964 --> 00:04:37,465
I can see everything.

98
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:38,925
Please stop.

99
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,181
I need a soup spoon.

100
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:49,852
Rule 17, don't turn your back
on bears, men you have wronged,

101
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:52,188
or the dominant turkey
during mating season.

102
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:56,442
There are 40 rules all Schrute boys
must learn before the age of five.

103
00:04:57,152 --> 00:05:00,780
Learn your rules
You better learn your rules

104
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:03,866
if you don't you'll be
eaten in your sleep

105
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:19,715
What is it?

106
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,467
You've gotta tell
Andy about us.

107
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,678
That is a terrible idea.
One of your worst.

108
00:05:23,762 --> 00:05:25,930
Get it over with. Then we
don't have to hide anymore.

109
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:27,682
You're expanding
on your worst idea.

110
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,183
Do you love me or not?

111
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,102
I've already admitted
that I do.

112
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:33,062
Why do you keep
making me repeat it?

113
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:35,439
Because you're
engaged to Andy.

114
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:48,452
Well?

115
00:05:48,996 --> 00:05:50,746
Not yet.
When?

116
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:52,540
When what?

117
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:55,334
When what?

118
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,420
You know
this can't go on.

119
00:05:57,796 --> 00:06:01,007
What can't go on? We have
to put an end to this.

120
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:03,217
- Seems like...
- Come on.

121
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:06,762
you guys should be
hearing what I'm saying.

122
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:10,891
This is really not how this
is supposed to happen.

123
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,185
Angela said she was gonna tell him.
She's just not ready.

124
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,187
When will she be ready?
I don't know.

125
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:16,439
Is she crazy in bed?
Yes.

126
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,523
Stop. What?
How so, specifically?

127
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:18,899
Okay, listen.

128
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:20,484
This shouldn't happen at work.
Eager and flexible.

129
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:21,694
And...
Really?

130
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:22,903
this shouldn't be
coming from his boss.

131
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:26,073
And we should also consider the fact
that that man has an anger issue.

132
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,783
Too late.
Well, it's not too late

133
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:30,536
'cause you haven't done anything.
I am already walking.

134
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,372
Michael, once this gets out...
Yes?

135
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:35,207
I don't know how
it's gonna go down.

136
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:37,001
Okay, what does that mean?

137
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:38,753
Might get ugly.

138
00:06:38,837 --> 00:06:43,007
Jim, this has to get out
so we can all deal with it.

139
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,301
But you're leaving.

140
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:49,472
Have a good trip. Thanks.

141
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:52,016
Andy?
Yeah?

142
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,392
Walk with me.

143
00:06:53,477 --> 00:06:54,643
Will do, boss man.

144
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:08,491
I do not
have much time.

145
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,911
Car's all the way
over there.

146
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:15,331
To tell you what I
have to tell you.

147
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:20,503
And just bear in mind that
when I say these things

148
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:26,759
that are bad things that
you hear in your ears,

149
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:30,429
this is something that I,

150
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:32,973
if I were you,
that I wouldn't want to hear.

151
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,266
You're not making
any sense.

152
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:37,645
Well, no, I'm not.

153
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:40,940
So I, I'm not
very articulate today,

154
00:07:41,024 --> 00:07:43,442
so I'll just leave it
for another time.

155
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:46,112
Another day.
All righty.

156
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:48,280
Which will be fine.
I am off.

157
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:50,783
Have a good meeting.
Thank you.

158
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,119
Kick Wallace's ass.

159
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:55,371
Okay, I will.

160
00:07:56,665 --> 00:07:58,958
Dwight and Angela are
having an affair, so...

161
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,752
I can't hear you
through the glass.

162
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:03,796
Dwight and Angela
are having an affair.

163
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:06,298
They've been sleeping
together for some time.

164
00:08:06,383 --> 00:08:09,260
That was the news.
I wanted to let you know.

165
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,762
What?
All right. See you later.

166
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:16,809
Are you serious?
Yeah.

167
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:38,831
I knew something bad
was gonna happen today.

168
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:39,957
You said that
yesterday.

169
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,001
Yeah, my neighbor
got murdered.

170
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:43,210
What are you standing for?

171
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:46,172
If I'm sitting, I can't disable
his neck or his groin.

172
00:08:46,256 --> 00:08:48,215
You're not gonna do anything
to his neck or his groin.

173
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,676
If I'm sitting, I don't
have the option to.

174
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,763
Dwight, I'm in charge while Michael's
gone, and I need you to sit.

175
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,865
I need to talk to you.

176
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:14,116
We can talk right here.

177
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:16,535
I need to talk to you
in private.

178
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,578
We're not listening.

179
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:20,080
Let's go to the
conference room.

180
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,877
Is it true?

181
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:27,588
What have you heard? That
you're sleeping with Dwight.

182
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:29,131
That doesn't
sound like me.

183
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,216
Is it true?

184
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,092
Andy, I'm engaged
to you.

185
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:34,887
I mean, we just signed off
on our wedding flowers.

186
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,847
Would I have said yes
to formal chrysanthemums

187
00:09:36,932 --> 00:09:38,224
if I didn't want
to get married?

188
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,351
And we went through all that
stuff with our wedding cake.

189
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:43,896
Just answer the question.
Are you sleeping with Dwight?

190
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:46,774
A little bit.

191
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:49,985
How long has this
been going on?

192
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,237
I don't know.

193
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:54,073
I mean, we were together, and
then he killed Sprinkles,

194
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:55,991
and then we stopped
and...

195
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,079
I don't know exactly when
we started up again.

196
00:10:00,163 --> 00:10:01,247
Who else knows about it?

197
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:02,414
Michael.

198
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:03,999
Who else?

199
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,710
Let me think about it.
I, um...

200
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,088
They're...

201
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,297
Oh, God.

202
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,091
Come on!

203
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:17,513
So listen, Michael, your branch
has been doing great lately,

204
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,267
and your sales staff is
reporting very strong numbers.

205
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:24,186
Outperforming last year,
in fact.

206
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:28,357
And I don't know
exactly how to put this,

207
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:35,072
but what are you
doing right?

208
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:37,825
Right what?

209
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:39,994
Utica, Albany, all the other
branches are struggling,

210
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,831
but your branch is
reporting strong numbers.

211
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:46,250
Look, you're not
our most traditional guy,

212
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:50,170
but clearly something
you are doing is right,

213
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:53,382
and I just... I need to get
a sense of what that is.

214
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:59,138
David, here it is. My
philosophy is basically this.

215
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:02,182
And this is something
that I live by,

216
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:04,393
and I always have,
and I always will.

217
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:11,233
Don't ever, for any reason,
do anything to anyone

218
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:17,614
for any reason ever, no
matter what, no matter where,

219
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:23,954
or who, or who you are with,
or where you are going,

220
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:27,291
or where you've been

221
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,211
ever,

222
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,006
for any reason
whatsoever...

223
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,884
Sometimes I'll start a sentence and
I don't even know where it's going.

224
00:11:36,968 --> 00:11:39,511
I just hope I find
it along the way.

225
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:41,096
Like an improv
conversation.

226
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:43,640
An improversation.

227
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,809
This is gonna sound
sort of high maintenance,

228
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:48,270
but could we have it, like,
three degrees cooler in here?

229
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:50,856
I always think better
when it's cooler.

230
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,650
Here's the thing, Michael
is doing something right,

231
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:55,569
and in this
economic climate,

232
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:58,030
no method of success
can be ignored.

233
00:11:58,114 --> 00:12:01,533
It's not really a time for executives
to start getting judgmental now.

234
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,035
It's Hail Mary time.

235
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:06,080
Hey, what say
we order up some pasta?

236
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,208
What say we do.

237
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:12,961
Standard, you know.
Nothing fancy.

238
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,338
So, like, missionary?

239
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:16,215
I said nothing fancy.

240
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,591
Do you love him?

241
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,385
I love you.

242
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:21,053
Why should I believe that?

243
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:24,681
Andy, we are at
a crossroads here,

244
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:28,143
and we can either give in
to what people are saying,

245
00:12:28,228 --> 00:12:29,603
that we're not
good together...

246
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:30,729
Who says that?

247
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:33,107
or we can
prove them wrong.

248
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,068
Let's prove
them wrong.

249
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,494
Where's Dwight?

250
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:46,912
You okay, man?

251
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:51,583
No, not at all, actually. But
thanks for asking. Appreciate it.

252
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:53,627
You know what? I'd also like
to take this opportunity

253
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:57,005
to thank all of you
for lying to my face

254
00:12:57,632 --> 00:12:59,758
and not telling me what's been
going on this entire time.

255
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,427
You are welcome.

256
00:13:07,183 --> 00:13:08,183
Dwight.

257
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:11,019
Andy.

258
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:14,106
It's over.

259
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,774
Good.
She broke up with you.

260
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:18,861
No, it's over
between you two.

261
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:22,322
No way.
I am not giving up.

262
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,741
You have to.
No, I don't.

263
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,454
She doesn't love you.
She's marrying me.

264
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:29,788
Well, I don't know
about that

265
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:34,418
because she certainly seems to
enjoy making lovemaking with me.

266
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:36,128
Angela Bernard...

267
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:38,213
Will never be her name.

268
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:41,675
Will be her name and you
will have to call her that.

269
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,051
I don't think so.

270
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:46,221
Hey, guys. Why don't we
just cool off a bit?

271
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:47,431
I'm telling you
to back down.

272
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,057
And I'm telling you that
I will never back down.

273
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,142
Then I'll make you.

274
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:51,727
Oh, really? How are
you going to do that?

275
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:53,145
Through the use of force.

276
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,480
That is very general

277
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:55,981
and does not scare me
in the slightest.

278
00:13:56,065 --> 00:13:57,483
I will fight you.

279
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,819
Nope.
Okay, fine. Good! A duel.

280
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:03,030
The winner gets Angela.
Fine!

281
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:04,573
Fine!
This is nuts.

282
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,074
What is your weapon?
Okay, you know what?

283
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,201
That's enough
because...

284
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:08,327
Hey, this is none
of your business.

285
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:10,787
Hey, it is my business
what happens at work.

286
00:14:10,914 --> 00:14:13,248
Guess what? Not happening at work.
Yes.

287
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,125
We're gonna do it outside.
Outside of work.

288
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,504
None of your business.
None of your business, then.

289
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:20,047
Good, so what weapon?

290
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:21,173
My bare hands.

291
00:14:21,257 --> 00:14:24,176
That is stupid. I will use a sword,
and I will cut off your bare hands.

292
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,636
Then I'll get
something, too.

293
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,347
I've had two men
fight over me before.

294
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,974
Usually it's over which one
gets to hold the camcorder.

295
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:34,228
Angela, you have to put a
stop to this right now.

296
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,609
I will respect the
results of the duel.

297
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,403
Of course you will.
I call loser.

298
00:14:43,738 --> 00:14:48,450
I will be taking my break
at 4:00 in the parking lot.

299
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:51,161
I will also be
taking my break

300
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:54,122
at the exact same time
and in the same location.

301
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:57,292
What a coincidence.
Hmm.

302
00:15:05,802 --> 00:15:09,429
So, I either get more involved
or I take a sick day.

303
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:14,560
Leaving Dwight in charge.
Oh, God.

304
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:27,155
How'd that get there?

305
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:34,162
There's a star-shaped thing
taped under the kitchen table.

306
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:35,872
Thanks, Meredith.

307
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,667
So I was in the office,

308
00:15:39,377 --> 00:15:44,506
and I look over to our accounting
division, and there's Kevin Malone.

309
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,427
Kevin is wearing a jacket
that I've never seen before,

310
00:15:48,511 --> 00:15:51,096
and I call over
to Kevin,

311
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,350
"Kevin, is that
a tweed jacket?"

312
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,269
And he looks at me
and he says,

313
00:15:57,353 --> 00:15:59,605
"Michael, yes,
it is a tweed jacket."

314
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,648
And I look back
at him and I say,

315
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:06,236
"I feel the need,
the need for tweed."

316
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:10,365
It's hard to try and
evaluate yourself, Michael,

317
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,659
but I appreciate
you trying.

318
00:16:13,703 --> 00:16:15,412
And thanks for coming in.
Oh!

319
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,289
Thank you.
Yes.

320
00:16:17,373 --> 00:16:19,124
I have to say,
I am so impressed

321
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,668
with the potential
you see in me.

322
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,713
Yeah.
Okay.

323
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:32,554
Yeah, finish up.

324
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:37,100
Come on! Where are you?

325
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:40,228
Let's do this thing!

326
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,565
Come on!
Come on out!

327
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,069
I can't believe they're
gonna fight over me.

328
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:50,405
I guess people have fewer
choices as they get older.

329
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:51,865
Come on!

330
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:53,825
Hey, has anything
happened yet?

331
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,327
Where are you?
It's 4:10.

332
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:56,411
I don't think
he's gonna show.

333
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:59,498
Oh, come on, man.
Believe in something.

334
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:06,088
Come on, coward! Where are you?
Where...

335
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:14,346
"From the desk
of Andrew Bernard."

336
00:17:15,973 --> 00:17:17,891
A note. Pathetic.

337
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:23,730
"Dear Dwight, by now you have received
my note. How are you? I am well.

338
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:26,400
"You are no doubt wondering
why I have left this note.

339
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,777
"It's come to my attention that
in any physical match with you,

340
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:31,154
"I would surely
be bested." True.

341
00:17:32,156 --> 00:17:36,118
"The soft underbelly of my refined
upbringing is my soft underbelly."

342
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:38,370
There's Andy.
He's in his car.

343
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:39,746
You guys,
what is he doing?

344
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,456
Why isn't Dwight
turning around?

345
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:45,001
The Prius is silent if he keeps
it under five miles per hour.

346
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:46,378
He deserves the win.

347
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:48,046
"Alas, after
much consideration..."

348
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:49,297
Oh, my God!

349
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,382
What's happening?

350
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:52,759
Andy's running
over Dwight with his car.

351
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:55,679
Whoa! What are you...
Hey, hey!

352
00:17:55,763 --> 00:17:56,763
Yeah!

353
00:17:57,974 --> 00:17:58,974
Come on! Ow!

354
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,017
My God.

355
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:03,979
You give up?
Never!

356
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,814
Get out and face me
like a man!

357
00:18:05,898 --> 00:18:08,734
I am a man! I'm a bigger
man than you'll ever be!

358
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,986
I would never sleep
with another man's fiancee!

359
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,239
You're not a man! You don't
know how to take care of her!

360
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,867
All you do is
dress fancy and sing.

361
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,953
What does that mean?

362
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:21,413
You can't even
protect her!

363
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:24,124
Protect her from what?
Bears, you idiot?

364
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,418
When's the last time you saw
a damn bear in Scranton?

365
00:18:26,502 --> 00:18:28,378
Last year, idiot!

366
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,839
Dwight, are your
legs broken?

367
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,758
No, my right one's falling
asleep a little bit.

368
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:33,925
Andy,
are you all right?

369
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,094
Go away, Tuna!
I'm winning this!

370
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,180
Yeah, back off.
This isn't your fight.

371
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:41,099
Oh! How much is this
gonna cost? Oh!

372
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:43,477
What? Trust fund'll
take care of that.

373
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,021
What did you say? I'm
sorry, I couldn't hear you.

374
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:47,522
I said...

375
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,816
What? You stupid idiot!

376
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:52,402
You're like a big... You're like a
Sasquatch. You live in the woods!

377
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:55,280
Sasquatches are the strongest
animal on the planet!

378
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:57,365
So fine,
call me a Sasquatch.

379
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,285
I don't get it! How could she be
sleeping with you this whole time

380
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:02,913
and only sleep
with me twice?

381
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:04,915
What?
What?

382
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:06,917
She's sleeping with you?

383
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:09,753
I'm her fiance.

384
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:11,671
She said she was only
sleeping with me.

385
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:58,218
Yes, hi,
my last name is Bernard,

386
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:02,097
and I would like to cancel a
wedding cake that I had ordered.

387
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,769
B-E-R-N-A-R-D.

388
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:12,232
Yeah, one shaped
like a sailboat.

389
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,444
Yep, that's the one.

390
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:19,531
Thank you.

391
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:24,202
Wow, what a day.

392
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:27,038
I thought I was
gonna get chewed out,

393
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:30,876
but hold on, here's an
attaboy for you. What?

394
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:34,629
Rollercoaster ride.
Rollercoaster.

395
00:20:34,964 --> 00:20:39,175
It just goes to show, you leave
Scranton, exciting things can happen.
