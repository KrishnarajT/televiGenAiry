1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,680
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:08,453
Top of the morning to you.

3
00:00:09,758 --> 00:00:13,592
Green M&M's.
Nature's Viagra.

4
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:17,326
Two of my favorite joke areas
combined. It's gonna be a good day.

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,593
I don't want to
bring my friends.

6
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:19,656
Why can't it
just be the two of us?

7
00:00:19,735 --> 00:00:21,327
Because it's St. Patrick's
Day. People go out in groups.

8
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:22,427
Well, why don't you
invite your friends?

9
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:23,664
Why are you being
so weird about this?

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:26,708
Stop fighting! Just on
St. Patrick's Day, okay?

11
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:29,539
Just one
perfect day a year.

12
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:33,172
No hassles,
no problems, no kids.

13
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:34,876
Why no kids?

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,383
Yeah, where are your kids?

15
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,943
Nope. Uh-uh. Not today.

16
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:41,387
It is
St. Patrick's Day,

17
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:45,052
and here in Scranton,
that is a huge deal.

18
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:49,759
It is the closest that the
Irish will ever get to Christmas.

19
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:14,547
Welcome back, Dad.

20
00:01:14,623 --> 00:01:15,647
Oh, thank you.

21
00:01:15,724 --> 00:01:16,884
Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,051
Hey!

23
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:19,526
Welcome back, Tuna.

24
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:20,687
Hey.

25
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:24,289
Very good. Okay, we'll get
back to you on that right away. Thanks.

26
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,425
What do we got here?

27
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,027
Mega-desk.
Of course.

28
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:30,435
Command central.
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,701
Surveillance, gaming
and business.

30
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,004
Okay.

31
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:43,108
What? Come on. Jim!

32
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,109
Tweedledee and
Tweedle Dumbass

33
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:47,087
have been away
on maternity leave,

34
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:50,023
but now Tweedle Dumbass is
back and we have a problem.

35
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:53,550
Yes, getting hooked on
mega-desk was my own damn fault.

36
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:56,262
I don't care
about assigning blame.

37
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:59,694
All I care about is mega-desk.

38
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:05,070
That is all I care about.
Getting more mega-desk.

39
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:09,106
Oh, I love this.
So much fun.

40
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:11,669
There's such team spirit
in this room.

41
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:13,442
Morning, darling.
Morning.

42
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:16,109
Well, this is my last day at
the Scranton branch for a while,

43
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:18,119
but I'm leaving it in
the very capable hands

44
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:20,621
of some of the loveliest people I've
ever had the pleasure of knowing.

45
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,157
You know,
I'm gonna miss this place,

46
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:24,487
and the snow.

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,758
Do my dogs
love peeing in that snow!

48
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,821
Makes me think
they're onto something.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,467
Oh, good morning,
sweetheart.

50
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,594
Good morning, honey pile.

51
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:38,003
I'm sorry, but is that a
gift I see in your hands?

52
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:40,541
It is. This is a
little something for you

53
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:43,305
to remember your time here
in Scranton by.

54
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:45,906
Is that a lump of coal?

55
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:47,005
Yes, it is.

56
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:48,174
I haven't been that naughty.

57
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,185
No, no, no. That is
a good gift, actually.

58
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:54,051
Buildings here in Scranton
are literally powered by coal.

59
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,522
Uh... Thank you very much.

60
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,056
We don't get much coal
down in Tallahassee.

61
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,685
I mean,
just alligators

62
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:02,491
and some of the worst Chinese
food you've ever tasted.

63
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,759
Mmm, that sounds
great, actually.

64
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,700
Well, if you ever get down
in my neck of the woods,

65
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,430
you got a place to stay.

66
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:11,805
When you work for
Sabre, only one thing matters,

67
00:03:11,873 --> 00:03:16,537
and I don't care if you're a
loser or you practice bestiality,

68
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,905
if Jo likes you,
you are in.

69
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,206
And I am in.

70
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:25,513
Erin Go Bragh.

71
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:27,714
Andy "Go Bragh" to you.

72
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:29,518
Nice kilt.
Thanks.

73
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:32,092
It's actually my sister's
old field hockey skirt.

74
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,027
Erin and I have our first date
tonight and it has to be perfect.

75
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:37,588
Why? Because according
to How I Met Your Mother,

76
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,658
that's the date that your kids are
gonna wait patiently to hear about,

77
00:03:40,736 --> 00:03:42,897
and you better have
a good story for them.

78
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,066
Nope.
Great.

79
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:48,166
No.
Thank you.

80
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:49,676
No, no, no, no, no.

81
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:51,508
Come on. Come on.
Five more minutes.

82
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,071
Five more minutes
of mega-desk? Please?

83
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,851
Is this yours or mine?

84
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,355
They say that
no man is an island.

85
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:07,725
False. I am an island,
and this island is volcanic.

86
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:09,058
Mega-desk!

87
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:14,501
And it is about to erupt with
the molten hot lava of strategy.

88
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:18,202
Good Lord. I can't
believe I'm missing this.

89
00:04:18,273 --> 00:04:19,968
It's kind of like that
lip thing she did last night,

90
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,033
like a half-snarl,
half-smile.

91
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,805
I get the sense
that she's very ironic.

92
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,609
Okay. Love you.
We'll talk soon.

93
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,408
Must be amazing
being a father, right?

94
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:31,713
The miracle of life.

95
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:33,379
It is. Big time.

96
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:37,721
Ah, that baby is just discovering
a whole wide world right now.

97
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,659
It's pretty amazing.
What up is, what down is,

98
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,129
who Mom is,
who Dad is.

99
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:45,962
Must be tough being here
with all that going on.

100
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:48,059
It's tough being here
for a lot of reasons.

101
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,728
I mean,
you're here at work

102
00:04:49,805 --> 00:04:53,172
and the baby thinks that the
refrigerator is its father.

103
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:55,610
Is that what
happened to you?

104
00:04:55,677 --> 00:04:57,645
I'll tell you
what happened to me.

105
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:00,409
I didn't see my father for
the first two years of my life.

106
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:03,940
I thought my mother was my father
and my wet nurse was my mother.

107
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,577
And that's
a common mistake.

108
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,986
Turned out fine
for me. But Mose?

109
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:12,850
Oh, same story,
different ending.

110
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,930
Hey, are you sick?

111
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:23,493
Oh, no, I'm fine. I just
have a little indigestion.

112
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,835
In your nose?
Yes.

113
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:30,074
I'm a little sick, but I
don't want to miss my date with Andy.

114
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:31,339
I'll get better.

115
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,540
Whenever I'm sick it goes
away within a few hours,

116
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:37,415
except once when I was in the
hospital from age three to six.

117
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:42,149
Now, after all the talking
I've been doing, it's your turn.

118
00:05:42,824 --> 00:05:46,521
This is a town hall meeting. I
want to hear what y'all sound like.

119
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:48,495
That is a great idea, J.B.
Thank you.

120
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:51,259
You know, I get way
too many ideas from the top.

121
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,198
Now, I want to
hear your ideas.

122
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:56,169
I mean, did you guys
know that Liquid Paper,

123
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:58,968
that wasn't invented
by some fancy engineer.

124
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,770
No, that was created
by a lowly typist.

125
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:06,880
Oh, Jo, I have an idea
for suntan lotion soap.

126
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:09,173
You know, it doesn't
have to be an invention.

127
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:10,275
I have a question.

128
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:12,217
Oscar, homosexual accountant.

129
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:13,914
In the training manual,
it says that

130
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,890
there's a minority executive
training program in Tallahassee.

131
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,485
I am so proud of Sabre's
Print In All Colors initiative.

132
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:24,895
Any Sabre employee of color
is welcome to apply, okay?

133
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:26,491
Darryl?

134
00:06:26,568 --> 00:06:29,093
Darryl. Mellow, soulful,
smart for warehouse.

135
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:30,604
Okay, hush now.
Okay.

136
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:34,039
The Sabre shipping method
could be more efficient.

137
00:06:34,109 --> 00:06:37,306
Combining inventory systems
makes sense on paper,

138
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:40,279
but printers and paper
ship differently.

139
00:06:40,348 --> 00:06:42,816
It would be faster
to deliver them separately

140
00:06:42,884 --> 00:06:44,351
instead of waiting
on everything to come in.

141
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:45,943
But you wouldn't need
more trucks? I mean...

142
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:48,956
Not at all. There's a
way it can be scheduled.

143
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:50,423
I sketched
this out downstairs.

144
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:51,516
Well, look at you.

145
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:54,960
Look at that picture
that you drew. Nice job.

146
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,793
We are very
proud of you.

147
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:58,196
You know what? We are
going to tape that up

148
00:06:58,266 --> 00:06:59,733
on the refrigerator
in the kitchen.

149
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:01,632
I like this, Darryl.

150
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:03,766
I like this a lot.

151
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,603
Maybe you should be
doing your sketching upstairs.

152
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:07,801
Would you like
an office up here?

153
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:09,707
Are you serious?
Yeah.

154
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:10,972
Take Jim's old office.

155
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,412
Oh, I set my stuff
up in there.

156
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:17,212
So, just give me a few minutes
to clean it out for you.

157
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,684
Yeah. I want to
hear more from you.

158
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:19,777
Absolutely.

159
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,083
All right.
Yeah, thank you.

160
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:25,115
Okay. Any questions?
Anything on anybody's mind?

161
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:26,490
I'm leaving tonight.

162
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:28,290
This is your last
chance for a while.

163
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:32,197
No! Say it's not so,
Jo! We're gonna miss you.

164
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:33,996
We are gonna
miss you so much!

165
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:35,058
Don't go away!

166
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:37,434
Okay. Florida
ain't that far away.

167
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,234
Well, I'm heading
down there.

168
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:40,898
Well, anytime, now.
So, who...

169
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:43,706
How about
July 4th weekend?

170
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:46,879
Oh, honey,
you didn't buy a ticket.

171
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:48,210
I did.

172
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:52,284
Oh, honey,
I am not home very often,

173
00:07:52,787 --> 00:07:55,654
and me and my relatives,
they take up the guest house.

174
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:57,191
I think you should
check with my office

175
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,489
before you book
any dates, okay?

176
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:02,655
You know what? In the
spirit of full disclosure,

177
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:05,560
I have actually reserved
a bunch of different seats

178
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:06,794
on a bunch
of different flights,

179
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,859
but there are a couple flights
that only have two tickets left,

180
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:09,926
so I think we should
pull the trigger...

181
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,199
Enough!

182
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:19,714
All right, everybody. Just
try to put a brave face on.

183
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:22,273
Let's follow
the chain of events.

184
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,510
Jo likes Michael,

185
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,480
Jo invites
Michael to house,

186
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:30,221
Jo doesn't like
Michael anymore.

187
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:33,986
Mmm.

188
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:42,596
Moving on up
To the east side

189
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:46,674
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

190
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:50,042
Hello. I want you to stop
what you're doing right now.

191
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:51,806
You are stressed and I
am taking you to lunch.

192
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,644
No, that's very generous
of you, but I'm all set.

193
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:55,740
No is not an option.

194
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,114
Yes, it is.

195
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:03,257
All right, well, if you need me, I'll
be on the other side of that wall.

196
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,418
Knock once for yes,
twice for no.

197
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:09,020
How many knocks does it take
to get you to do some work?

198
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,725
Okay. I'll be over there.

199
00:09:16,438 --> 00:09:17,427
And I'm actually pleased

200
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:20,372
to be able to offer you printer
cartridges and toner now.

201
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:21,636
Jim.
Yeah.

202
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,302
Jim, sorry to bother you.
What?

203
00:09:23,378 --> 00:09:25,073
My headphones are broken.
Right.

204
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,773
Can I listen to
my music at a low volume?

205
00:09:26,848 --> 00:09:27,872
That's great. Great.

206
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:29,143
Okay.
Yeah.

207
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:32,983
The cat's in the cradle and
the silver spoon Little boy...

208
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:35,488
When was the last time
you updated your printer?

209
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:37,616
"When you coming home, Dad?"
"I don't know when"

210
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:38,716
No. You need to stop now.

211
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:44,425
We'll be together then, now We're
going to have a good time then

212
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,827
Whether it's this time
or the next time.

213
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:51,433
The cat's
in the cradle and the silver spoon

214
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,838
Little boy blue
and the man in the moon

215
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:56,035
No, we can definitely
talk about it...

216
00:09:56,111 --> 00:09:58,545
You know what? Can I call you
back? That'd be great. Thank you.

217
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:02,845
We'll be together then We're
going to have a good time

218
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:05,647
No, I know I need
to work, I just...

219
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,278
I feel weird
not being home.

220
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:10,821
I am not surprised that Dwight's
using my baby to steal my desk.

221
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:15,625
I'm a little surprised
that it's working.

222
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:18,295
This fax came for you.

223
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:20,766
Oh, no, no, no.
Are you feeling ill?

224
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:24,269
Oh, no, honey, if you've got a
bug, I want you to go on home.

225
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,933
I can't have you getting
Callie and Jo Junior sick.

226
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:29,738
These dogs have gotta be in a
commercial with Dwight Howard next week.

227
00:10:29,811 --> 00:10:31,870
Oh. No, I feel like
I could lift a car.

228
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:34,005
Yeah, but you sound
like death, girl.

229
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:35,174
Now, why don't
you go on home,

230
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,615
take care of yourself,
get in bed,

231
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:39,245
and shred that and have them
send me a clean fax, all right?

232
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,378
Well...

233
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,762
She should go home.
It's not the end of the world.

234
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:49,797
We'll go on
a date next week.

235
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:52,992
She's still going to
like me in a week, right?

236
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:57,794
Yes?

237
00:10:57,872 --> 00:11:01,103
I was just working at my desk and I
wanted to run some new leads by you.

238
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:02,837
Oh, you're sick.

239
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,208
Dang it.

240
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,803
That's exactly why I sent
that receptionist home.

241
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,904
No, no, I'm not.

242
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,209
Getting everybody
sick in the office.

243
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:09,307
I have some
good ideas that...

244
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:11,147
I don't need any
heroes here, honey.

245
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:12,846
It's time for you
to go on home now.

246
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:14,286
You sure?
Yeah.

247
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:17,654
You'll probably feel better once
you get some pants on. Come on.

248
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:26,400
Very nice.
Not bad, huh?

249
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,062
Real Hoop Dreams story
you got there.

250
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:33,567
Oh, man, you seem
to have caught Jo's eye.

251
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,575
How'd you make that happen?

252
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,338
I impressed her
with my good ideas.

253
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,279
Seriously. How did you do it?

254
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:43,240
I made a suggestion at
the meeting that was good.

255
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:44,342
You were there.

256
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:46,614
How do I put
this delicately?

257
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:51,622
Does her family owe your family
something in terms of a past injustice?

258
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,457
Now, Mike, I have
to ask you to leave

259
00:11:57,532 --> 00:12:00,330
so that I can learn
about this tiny television.

260
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,503
Mmm, okay. All right.

261
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,069
Hey, there.
Hey, there.

262
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,702
So, I think I'm done.

263
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:15,739
Gonna head out, unless you want to
chat, like we were doing earlier.

264
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,978
Well, there's chatting time
and there's working time,

265
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,576
and I'm still
on working time.

266
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:23,784
Mmm? Well, the clock
says chatting time, so...

267
00:12:24,392 --> 00:12:27,828
Well, if you feel like you've
done a solid day's work.

268
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,356
Right.

269
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:31,389
What?

270
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,663
Well, I mean, if you can
put your name on this day

271
00:12:34,936 --> 00:12:37,427
and be proud of the
amount of work you've done,

272
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:40,440
then by all means, you
should toodle on home.

273
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:42,569
Mmm...

274
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:46,003
Okay.

275
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:48,282
Is there something else
I can help you with?

276
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,817
No, no, no,
that's super clear-ish.

277
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:59,391
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

278
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:06,662
Just because
Jo has no life

279
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:10,500
does not mean that the
rest of us don't have lives.

280
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:15,069
Oscar has a life. I
think Ryan has a life.

281
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,639
This is outrageous.

282
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:20,736
Hey, Pac-Man.

283
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:22,305
Hey, what's up,
Butt Plug?

284
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:24,442
How you doing, stud?
You're already there?

285
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,612
Dude, I've been
here since 3:00.

286
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:28,315
I've boot and
rallied twice.

287
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:29,720
How's the lady situation?

288
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:30,985
Fat and ugly.

289
00:13:31,526 --> 00:13:32,925
You might actually
have a chance.

290
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,258
Oh, damn, that sounds great.

291
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:39,527
Unfortunately I am stuck here because
my boss is making us work late.

292
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:43,662
Oh, here's what you do. Hike up
your skirt and pull out your tampon,

293
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:46,572
borrow some balls
and come meet me.

294
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:48,370
Yeah, maybe next year.

295
00:13:48,443 --> 00:13:49,967
Maybe next queer.

296
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:53,246
Hey, ladies, who wants
some bangers and mash?

297
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:59,211
Oh, Andy!
Hi.

298
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:00,948
I'm in my jammy-jams.

299
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,252
That's okay.
I'm in my worky-works.

300
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,490
You look amazing.

301
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,653
Thanks.

302
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:09,386
Come in.
Okay.

303
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,802
Hey, me and Creed are in.
Are you guys in?

304
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,665
Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.

305
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:19,070
All right.

306
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:31,213
Oh, you don't become the
most powerful woman in Tallahassee

307
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,810
by slacking off.

308
00:14:32,887 --> 00:14:35,321
You do it by working hard.

309
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:37,824
Or marrying rich.

310
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:40,158
I did both.

311
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,664
Got a little client meeting
at Shanny O'Gannigans tonight.

312
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:46,563
It shouldn't
go all night long,

313
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:48,534
so if you'd like me to,
I can swing by your house

314
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:51,800
so the baby can experience
a strong male presence.

315
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:54,935
No? Nothing?

316
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,375
Okay, have fun working.

317
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:05,742
Hi there, Jo.
Sorry to interrupt.

318
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,947
This evening I have...

319
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:10,818
Hello?
Hey, Jo, it's Jim Halpert.

320
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:14,623
I actually scheduled a meeting at
7:30 with a very important client,

321
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:17,961
and it's so weird, 'cause we never
have meetings after 5:00 p.m.,

322
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:21,763
but I was hoping that maybe
just this once it would be okay.

323
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:25,128
Well, sure. You know, you go
ahead and push some printers.

324
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:26,195
You know I will.

325
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:29,437
And by the way, seriously,
we never, never do this.

326
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,772
Okay.
Okay.

327
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,278
All right.

328
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,506
Sorry, sugar.
What did you want?

329
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:39,244
Well, you see, I actually do
have a meeting with a client.

330
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,455
I'm gonna just
reschedule for next week.

331
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,623
Thank you.

332
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,420
Thanks again,
by the way.

333
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:54,430
Hey, what are you
fellows doing up here?

334
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:55,628
We're here
to bust you out.

335
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:56,692
I wish, but I...

336
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:58,864
Dude, is your
shirt tucked in?

337
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:01,805
Oh, yeah.

338
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:04,208
I must have did that
when I used the bathroom.

339
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,811
All right, then.
Let me get to it.

340
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:09,042
All right.

341
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:11,441
See you later.

342
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:20,858
Your hand's cold.

343
00:16:20,928 --> 00:16:21,986
It is? I'm sorry.
Yeah.

344
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:23,121
Have some more blanket.

345
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:24,186
Oh, thanks.

346
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:25,254
What's up?

347
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,357
You're awake?

348
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:28,561
Andy, this is
my brother, Reed.

349
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:29,864
I didn't know
you had a brother.

350
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,962
He's my foster brother.

351
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,032
Well, any brother of
Erin's is a friend of mine.

352
00:16:35,109 --> 00:16:36,371
Nice to meet you.
Andy Bernard.

353
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,036
Cold hands.

354
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:40,641
Are we rotating seats or...

355
00:16:40,715 --> 00:16:41,977
Yeah, you're the guest.

356
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,518
Go take the easy chair.
Best seat in the house.

357
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:45,882
Plus, you don't
have to sit next

358
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:48,319
to this big dork
and her smelly feet.

359
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:52,018
Hey. My feet aren't smelly. They
smell like roses. Smell them.

360
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:54,084
Whoa.

361
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:02,893
So how does the whole
foster sibling thing work?

362
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,564
Do you guys
share one parent or...

363
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,871
None. We were in the same
house from ages 10 to 12

364
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:10,843
and then from 15 to 18.

365
00:17:11,846 --> 00:17:14,314
Right. Formative years.

366
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,607
Nice skirt.

367
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:17,844
It's a kilt.

368
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,657
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

369
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,532
Yes, I am anxious
to get out of work,

370
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:35,830
but let me be clear,

371
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:38,235
it's not to celebrate
St. Patrick's Day.

372
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,672
It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.

373
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:42,766
Overnight all
my damn bags home.

374
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,778
I'm carrying nothing
but my sable gloves.

375
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,814
I've had it with
Homeland Security.

376
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:50,612
And I want you to put all those
tracking numbers in my BlackBerry.

377
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:52,050
How late are we
gonna work tonight?

378
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,419
You never know with Jo. Sometimes
we're here until midnight,

379
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,720
sometimes she doesn't
show up for three days.

380
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:58,884
Why does she do that?

381
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,825
Why doesn't she just tell
you what your schedule is?

382
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:03,864
Yeah. That'd be awesome.
I could get a girlfriend.

383
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:06,092
I wouldn't have to go to
Amsterdam seven times a year.

384
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,398
But I'm young, right?
I will date when I'm dead.

385
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:14,902
Do I really want
to turn out like Gabe?

386
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,905
Twenty-six, single,

387
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:21,045
tied to my desk,
no life, no family.

388
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:24,846
I want to have been married by
the time I would have turned 30.

389
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,377
That's just...
That's just depressing.

390
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:31,514
Hello, Jo.

391
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:33,583
Anything I can do
for you, pudding?

392
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:36,960
There is, as a matter of fact.
It's getting sort of late.

393
00:18:37,031 --> 00:18:40,228
It's 8:30 and
it's St. Patrick's Day,

394
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:41,859
which is
a world ethnic holiday,

395
00:18:41,936 --> 00:18:45,235
so I have decided I'm going
to dismiss my employees.

396
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,698
Hmm.

397
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:48,540
I'm thrilled with the work
they've done today,

398
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,406
both the quality
and the quantity.

399
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:53,879
Great performance. Very,
very solid all the way around.

400
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,540
All right, then.

401
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:59,348
Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.

402
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,617
And also,

403
00:19:05,693 --> 00:19:09,789
I would like to say that I will be
canceling my trip down to Tallahassee,

404
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:13,595
although I do look forward to
our professional relationship.

405
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:16,793
Michael?
Yes?

406
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:20,766
I look forward to that, too.

407
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:31,308
Oh.

408
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,283
It's coming down out there.
Yes.

409
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:36,516
Thank you
for coming all the way here.

410
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:39,788
No, no. My pleasure.
I'm sorry I was so sick.

411
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:02,004
Great. Now I'm gonna get sick.

412
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:08,278
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Hey, guys, how are you?

413
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,150
Drinks are on me.

414
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:15,522
No, no, no, put your credit
cards away! It's on us.

415
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:18,064
All right!

416
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:19,599
Did I mess up
my career today

417
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,191
or my future
prospects at Sabre?

418
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:24,170
I don't know.
There is a chance, yes.

419
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:26,299
I'll tell you,
I love my job,

420
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:30,435
but Jo wants me to put on a show
for her and pretend to work late?

421
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,268
Nah.

422
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:36,046
I spent all day trying
to make her like me,

423
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:37,675
but I forgot to
ask myself something.

424
00:20:37,752 --> 00:20:39,242
Do I even like her?

425
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,620
As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin
said, "Don't worry, be happy."

426
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:45,214
Whoops.

427
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:48,990
Okay. Okay. All right.

428
00:20:49,063 --> 00:20:50,462
Best night ever.

429
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,328
What the hell is
going on back there?

430
00:20:56,937 --> 00:21:01,533
Yeah. We should be able to
have that over to you by Monday.

431
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:04,470
Yeah, no problem.

432
00:21:05,212 --> 00:21:06,907
Thank you.

433
00:21:06,981 --> 00:21:08,471
What the hell is this?

434
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,178
Oh!
This is not mega-desk.

435
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:12,913
No, it's not. They call it "quad-desk."

436
00:21:13,187 --> 00:21:15,485
That's ridiculous. This
is made up of three desks.

437
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,090
Oh, my God.

438
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:22,086
We're gonna have to
rename it then, aren't we?

439
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:29,596
Hello. Dwight Schrute.
