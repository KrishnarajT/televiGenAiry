1
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:06,050
And then, I think I'm going
to go to the garlic festival.

2
00:00:06,128 --> 00:00:08,187
Wow. Sounds like fun.
You guys would love it.

3
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:10,060
No, we wouldn't.
They have a TCBY booth.

4
00:00:10,132 --> 00:00:11,963
Cool. Same stuff you get downtown.

5
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,626
Do you like TCBY?
Who doesn't?

6
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:18,901
"I can't believe it's
yogurt." Lt'll be fun.

7
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:22,273
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're
expecting the both of you in an hour.

8
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:24,039
Oh, actually, it's just going to be me.

9
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:25,740
They said
the both of you.

10
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:26,974
That's a mistake.

11
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:29,176
You should give them
a call, check that out.

12
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,617
All right,
just clear this up.

13
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:33,985
Well, there's actually been
a few changes in the company,

14
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:36,490
and Michael and I are
actually at the same level.

15
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,822
So, I can... No.

16
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:41,625
No, why would
that be a problem?

17
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:43,494
Jim's a good kid,
he can handle a lot,

18
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:47,433
but sometimes you
have to call in a master.

19
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:52,573
Why would you date an amateur
when you could date a professional?

20
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:55,169
Great. See you then.

21
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:56,609
What?

22
00:00:56,678 --> 00:00:59,704
They said that they would feel
more comfortable if you came along.

23
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:01,716
Why don't they just want
you to go by yourself?

24
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:04,218
Why do they want me to come,
too? I don't understand.

25
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:06,254
I absolutely don't
understand, either.

26
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:10,223
I don't want you to feel like
I'm babysitting you or something.

27
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,627
All right.
All right.

28
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:15,288
Let me go get your stroller.

29
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:18,463
Sure.
Michael's a good teacher.

30
00:01:18,534 --> 00:01:20,399
A teacher is someone who stands

31
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:21,902
right next to you
your whole life

32
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,870
and never lets
you do anything.

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,804
That's what
a teacher is, right?

34
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:48,221
What are you going to call him? Dave.

35
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:50,197
No. What is his name? Dave.

36
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:52,324
Mr. Borchard.
They're very formal.

37
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,800
Yeah. I've spoken
to them on the phone.

38
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:56,337
Yeah, well,
this is not the phone.

39
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:59,806
This is real life, baby,
and you got to own it.

40
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,240
Is that what
you are wearing?

41
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,334
Yes, it is.

42
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:05,437
And that is the watch
that you are going to wear?

43
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:08,574
No, it is not. You
should wear this watch.

44
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,878
I will loan it to you.

45
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:12,477
It is a Tankard. I highly
recommend you wear that.

46
00:02:12,554 --> 00:02:14,488
No, thanks.
They are into style.

47
00:02:14,556 --> 00:02:15,545
Mmm-hmm.

48
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:17,592
They are into appearance.
We are selling success.

49
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,253
And paper.
That's sort of secondary.

50
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,456
Nope. No.

51
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,665
He's trying to
micro co-manage me.

52
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:29,932
Or co-micromanage me.

53
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,108
Here we are outside of
the Wilkes-Barre... W.B.

54
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:35,609
lndustrial Park.
Industrial P.

55
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:37,711
Making cold calls.

56
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:39,542
The two people
with the lowest sales

57
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:40,809
in the quarter
have to do them.

58
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:45,678
Palpabon
Drilling, where are you

59
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:49,713
Dean Trophies,
suite 100

60
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,022
Sherman Blinds & Rugs,
suite 202

61
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,119
Here it is.

62
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:55,356
Palpabon Drilling

63
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,954
Suite 401.

64
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:58,522
Yeah, I was going
to sing that part.

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,726
I know. Now you
don't have to.

66
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,996
Well, except it was going
to resolve the melody,

67
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,731
so now my head hurts.

68
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:05,739
It feels like
I held in a sneeze.

69
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,776
I hate this feeling.

70
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:13,540
Suite 401

71
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:18,244
All right.

72
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,413
Hi. Any messages?

73
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:21,513
You're soaking wet.

74
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,581
Oh, well, Jim and I
got caught in a little

75
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,856
flash rain, flash winds,
flash lightning.

76
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:28,556
Wow. Sounds scary.

77
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,122
It was. It was. And then
in an instant, it wasn't.

78
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:33,694
Why isn't Jim wet?

79
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:34,827
I outran it.

80
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,804
I don't think it rained.
My hip would be throbbing.

81
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,807
It rained. Michael,
can I get you something?

82
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,001
A towel, some cocoa?

83
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:42,839
Nothing. Cocoa.

84
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:44,978
I'll just leave that
suit in your office, then?

85
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,015
Good, yeah.

86
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:49,309
Must be nice to have
company on these cold calls.

87
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:51,909
We're kind of
a dynamic duo.

88
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,215
Or trio.

89
00:03:53,488 --> 00:03:56,457
How exciting! Do you
guys know the sex yet?

90
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,424
Oh, no, no.

91
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,997
We're not together. No,
no, no. Definitely not.

92
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:07,035
Definitely not. No,
we just work together.

93
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:11,002
Looks like somebody's got
a case of the definitelys.

94
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:17,903
Michael, the custodian from
Raskin Design is on the line.

95
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,709
He said they found your
keys in the koi pond.

96
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,373
Okay, thank you.

97
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,079
Did you say
koi pond?

98
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:28,685
Yeah? Michael, people
are asking questions.

99
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:31,123
Okay. Put them on speaker.

100
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,387
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

101
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:35,089
Hey, Michael, did you
fall into a koi pond?

102
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:38,496
I can't really hear you. I think
we have sort of a bad connection.

103
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:41,195
Jim, did Michael
fall into a koi pond?

104
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,997
It's like Michael said.
It was something else.

105
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:49,202
Okay, this is what it was.
It was these bunch of idiots

106
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:53,715
that had put a fish tank in the
ground with no cover and no railing.

107
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:54,908
So you fell in?
No.

108
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:57,451
Maybe I was trying to save
a child that had fallen in.

109
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,747
So a child
had fallen in?

110
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,014
Not yet.

111
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:01,419
That is hilarious.

112
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,981
No. Don't. I'm not going to
bump. I'm not going to bump.

113
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:07,722
And it was not hilarious.
It was very, very terrifying.

114
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:11,923
Truthfully, it wasn't
the way he fell in.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,527
It was how long it
took him to get out.

116
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:18,471
And we'd like to offer you
15% off your first purchase

117
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,906
as our way of welcoming
you to the area.

118
00:05:20,976 --> 00:05:22,739
Well, that sounds
like a really nice deal.

119
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:23,835
Sha-bow!

120
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:26,642
And I must say that since
we are a family business,

121
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:28,307
it's nice to see
that you are, too.

122
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:29,850
Oh!

123
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,012
Wow. You thought that...

124
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:35,648
Oh, my gosh.
Definitely not.

125
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:37,351
My mistake.
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:38,450
It's okay.

127
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:41,519
Nah, actually,
it's kind of not okay.

128
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:44,632
I date models.
Face models.

129
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:49,365
My girlfriend, on a
scale of one-to-Gisele,

130
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:52,232
a nine.

131
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:53,365
That's good for you.

132
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:55,876
Anyway, we also have a
special on envelopes...

133
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:58,139
Pam's carrying
our surrogate

134
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:02,980
because my girlfriend needed to
keep her figure for Fashion Week.

135
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:05,715
So, we put
our baby in Pam.

136
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,550
It doesn't matter
what Pam looks like.

137
00:06:08,623 --> 00:06:09,647
Yeah.

138
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,955
You were way meaner
to me than I was to you.

139
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,858
No, I wasn't, okay?

140
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,659
The very idea of us together
made you burst out laughing

141
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:19,701
like you just bit into an Adam
Sandler and jelly sandwich.

142
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:22,566
You blew the sale,
you idiot!

143
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:24,104
Let me tell you something.

144
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,697
I was never going
to make that sale.

145
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:30,205
Erin, do we have any of those
clips that hold paper together?

146
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:31,506
Staples?

147
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:35,048
David Wallace called.

148
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:36,516
Oh, he did?
What did he say?

149
00:06:36,585 --> 00:06:38,678
He heard you made a big
splash at the meeting.

150
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:40,949
Oh, my God, that was so mean what
I just said, and I didn't mean it.

151
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,512
It was Kevin and Meredith
who put me up to it.

152
00:06:43,558 --> 00:06:44,616
Okay.

153
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm going to kill you.

154
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:48,226
Michael, don't
listen to them.

155
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:49,285
Thank you, Stanley.

156
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:51,423
You just ignore
their carping.

157
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,524
Okay.

158
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:53,625
Michael?
Yes.

159
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:56,364
A carp is both a fish
and a term for complaining.

160
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:57,837
They're mocking you
with word play.

161
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:00,136
Hey, boss,
did you find Nemo?

162
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,335
I can name
Pixar movies, too.

163
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,845
Toy Story.
Don't you mean Koi Story?

164
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,777
And when you fell in,
did you flounder?

165
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:12,185
Michael, flounder is
both a kind of a fish...

166
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:13,585
I know what a flounder is.

167
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:15,647
Hey, Michael.
No! No!

168
00:07:15,724 --> 00:07:17,351
No more! That is it!

169
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:19,189
Everybody in the
conference room, right now!

170
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:22,196
I'm not usually
the butt of the joke.

171
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:24,061
I'm usually
the face of the joke.

172
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:28,696
I wish Jim had fallen
into that pond.

173
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,397
Then he'd have
to put on my suit,

174
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:33,373
and it would be too
short, and he'd look...

175
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:36,443
Damn it,
he'd still look good.

176
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:40,170
The most fundamental thing
about sensitivity training

177
00:07:40,248 --> 00:07:44,844
is that you cannot make fun of a
person for something or some action

178
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,320
that they have done
that they regret.

179
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:50,516
You can only make fun of things
that they have control over.

180
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:54,825
Like, Oscar is gay.
That is his choice.

181
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:59,333
We can make fun of that. I did
not choose to fall into a koi pond.

182
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:01,494
Michael, you still
can't make fun of people

183
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:04,300
for race or gender or sexual
orientation or religion...

184
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,670
Who let the lemonhead
into the room?

185
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,572
You are a waste of life
and you should give up.

186
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:13,810
Is what I want to say
but I won't,

187
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:16,851
because that is why we
are doing this right now.

188
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,513
So, Toby, welcome to sensitivity
training for real. Show of hands.

189
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:23,882
Who here has
been koi-ponded?

190
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:28,122
Who here has been the butt of
a joke that has gone too far?

191
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:31,359
Phyllis. Michael, you
make fun of us every day.

192
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,230
Yeah. Every single day.

193
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:34,666
You never said anything.

194
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,203
We have. Countless times.

195
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:40,332
Well, it is hard to tell the
difference between you guys saying,

196
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:42,000
"Stop, because
I want you to stop,"

197
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:46,013
or stop as in, "Stop, you're
making me laugh so hard.

198
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:48,845
"What you're doing is so
funny. You're on a roll.

199
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,680
"I am busting
a gut. Stop!"

200
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:53,143
That's never
been the case.

201
00:08:53,221 --> 00:08:55,553
We are going to make

202
00:08:55,624 --> 00:09:01,585
a Do Not Mock list.

203
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:06,828
Okay? Anything that we think might
be out of bounds, we put on this list.

204
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,602
Anything you put on this list,
you cannot be teased about.

205
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:11,730
Got it?

206
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,364
I'm going to kick it off.

207
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:19,209
Let's see what I have
to put on the list, right?

208
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:20,612
Okay.

209
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:24,641
I also have fallen into the
fountain at the Steamtown Mall.

210
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:26,880
You fell into
a second fountain?

211
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,451
Can you kick me
out of the meeting now?

212
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:31,958
Go. Go.

213
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,331
Starting today, teasing
will no longer be tolerated.

214
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:41,129
You mean there's
no teasing of any kind?

215
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:44,638
No, no, no, just things that are on
the list. That is the beauty of it.

216
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:47,106
Okay, who else? Who
else? Dwight, come on.

217
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,075
I don't want people
making fun of my nose.

218
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:50,611
Your nose?

219
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,576
It's too small.

220
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:56,583
The geometric proportions of my face
are perfect in every way but one.

221
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:59,419
My nose is too small.

222
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:01,478
I mean, it still works.
I can smell things.

223
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:04,753
I just have to be a lot
closer than most people.

224
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:06,619
Oh, my.
That is small.

225
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:08,322
Just write it
down, please.

226
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:09,590
Can you
breathe okay?

227
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,256
What keeps your
glasses on?

228
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,732
Hey, it's on the list,
everybody.

229
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:15,099
No, I haven't
finished writing.

230
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,470
Did you sneeze it off?
That's it. No more. Okay.

231
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,566
Who else, who else? Everybody's
going to get their chance.

232
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:24,476
I don't want people
making fun of my weight.

233
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:26,741
Okay, that's too broad. It's
got to be something else.

234
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:28,976
How about your
stomach? Yeah?

235
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:34,317
Who else? I'm very sensitive
about my petite figure.

236
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:35,578
Oh, God.

237
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:39,385
I am. I'm afraid of being
thrown around like a football.

238
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:42,194
Well, you know, Nicole Richie
might think that you are fat.

239
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:43,992
Does that make
you feel better?

240
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,123
Meredith?

241
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
I don't want to
say it out loud.

242
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:49,062
Okay, fine. Come on up
here, write it yourself.

243
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:52,197
And don't sign your name
to it, and nobody look.

244
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:55,806
Everybody,
look away, look away.

245
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:58,406
Well, I really didn't want
to put it on the board,

246
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,744
but I thought maybe it was
going to come out somehow.

247
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:03,010
So, what are you
going to do?

248
00:11:08,657 --> 00:11:09,646
Okay.

249
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,419
Some of you
may have noticed

250
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:17,796
I'm in that kind of ill-defined
relationship type of thing.

251
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:19,299
Okay, what do you
want me to write?

252
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,062
Just put Kelly.
Aw!

253
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:22,125
That still going on?

254
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,727
I will claw
your tiny nose off.

255
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,238
It's on the list.

256
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:26,671
Creed, your turn.

257
00:11:26,741 --> 00:11:29,107
If I write it down,
I can't be charged with it.

258
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:30,704
No one said that.

259
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:34,343
That is our sales pitch,
and we are sticking to it.

260
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,381
Well, you two are quite the
salesmen, and a very cute couple.

261
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:42,183
Well, it's...
Oh...

262
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,492
Thank you.
Thank you.

263
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,519
Some couples don't seem like
a good match, but you two do.

264
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:50,825
Well, you know.

265
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,527
Yeah, you know,
two peas in a pod.

266
00:11:53,601 --> 00:11:55,228
We complete
each other.

267
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:56,998
What can I say?
She loves to cook...

268
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:58,699
He loves to eat.

269
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:00,435
I love to dance...

270
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:01,668
I love to watch
him dance.

271
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:04,906
Yeah, right. Sometimes I'll just
dance for hours in the living room.

272
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:06,207
And I'll watch him.

273
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:09,079
And a baby on the way?
You must be so excited.

274
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,640
Mmm.
Yes.

275
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,949
Yeah, we are thrilled.
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:14,511
In fact, we spent
the whole weekend

277
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,853
researching various
birthing coaches.

278
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:17,914
Wasn't that
fun, honey?

279
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,118
It was, sweetie.
Yeah.

280
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:22,095
Oh, I know the best teacher.
Her name is Miss Janet.

281
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:23,391
Yeah, on Clearview Avenue.

282
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:24,489
Yeah!

283
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:25,658
Yeah.

284
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:31,134
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some
people say that I eat like a squirrel.

285
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:34,733
So now you're comparing
yourself to a cute, tiny animal?

286
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:36,968
Michael?
Hmm?

287
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:40,640
The custodian called again.
Apparently a koi has died.

288
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:41,807
Oh, man!

289
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:42,907
It's a fish.

290
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:44,881
They want you
to pay for it.

291
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,545
It could have died of
natural causes, though.

292
00:12:46,621 --> 00:12:50,318
Well, they said you stepped
on its head. He did not suffer.

293
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,157
When is the funeral?

294
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:55,696
Do not mock, Oscar.
Do not mock.

295
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:57,595
How much do they want?
$300.

296
00:12:57,665 --> 00:13:01,294
What? No. I could get a
fish for a five-cent worm.

297
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:05,362
You're paying way too much for
worms, man. Who's your worm guy?

298
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,637
Okay, great meeting,
everybody. That's it. No, no.

299
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,043
Thank you. No, we are
not done here. This...

300
00:13:14,516 --> 00:13:15,608
One of the baby
books suggests

301
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:19,016
the best birthing posture is
on all fours, like an animal.

302
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:20,714
I just wish I had
a special telephone

303
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:23,952
so I could find out exactly
what the little soybean wants.

304
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:27,153
Right? Hey, little
soybean. What do you want?

305
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:29,321
Right? How do...

306
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,897
I felt it kick.
Oh, that's great!

307
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:37,131
Oh, my gosh, like a little
magical foot just high-fived me.

308
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:38,604
Yeah, well,
that'll happen.

309
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:40,004
Oh, my gosh.

310
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,875
It's like he's trying to say,
"I love you, too, Daddy.

311
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:45,105
"I love you, too."

312
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,307
Sometimes we're so excited,
we forget where we are.

313
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:50,576
Like at a business meeting.

314
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:53,511
Message received,
little soybean.

315
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,188
I think you just got to
ride this one out, man.

316
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:57,554
No, Jim, you don't understand.

317
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,718
Things like this
just don't die.

318
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:03,430
Kids in high school still call
me "Ponytail." No, they don't.

319
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:06,058
Yes, they do, Jim.
Because of the time

320
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:08,659
I got my ponytail
stuck in the power drill.

321
00:14:08,736 --> 00:14:11,364
Maybe if you make fun of
yourself, it'll all go away.

322
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:12,701
I want to make fun
of you right now.

323
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:17,211
Really? Do it. I am a
big, stupid goofball.

324
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:19,872
No, don't do that.
You're not stupid.

325
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:22,340
See?

326
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:24,710
Oh, my God.

327
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:30,388
Hey, I just want to say
that I cannot believe

328
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,289
that I walked
into a koi pond.

329
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,555
I mean, seriously,
walk much?

330
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,724
Oh!

331
00:14:36,798 --> 00:14:39,892
I should wear a snorkel to the
next business meeting that I go to.

332
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:42,869
Michael, you know, when you think
about it, it's not all your fault.

333
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:44,802
I mean, who puts
a koi pond in a lobby?

334
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:46,602
Well,
you know what?

335
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:49,643
You're right, Phyllis,
but I've been there before.

336
00:14:49,711 --> 00:14:51,975
I've seen that pond.
This is the thing,

337
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:53,946
I am a world-class moron,
is the problem.

338
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:56,575
Michael, please stop it now.
You're embarrassing yourself.

339
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:57,982
It's okay.
We're having fun.

340
00:14:58,052 --> 00:15:01,215
It's actually not the first time
I've been embarrassed by a pond.

341
00:15:02,457 --> 00:15:03,481
In high school,

342
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:06,493
the girls volleyball team always
used to throw me into the frozen lake.

343
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,324
Four years in a row.

344
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:14,961
It was freezing! No, no,
no. This is even worse.

345
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,827
Couple of weeks ago, I
went to get a new cell phone

346
00:15:17,906 --> 00:15:19,464
and I wanted one
of those packages

347
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,734
where you have
the five, you know,

348
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:22,799
the friends
and family thing?

349
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:24,902
And the guy was like, "Who
are your five friends?"

350
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:27,709
And I'm like...
I didn't even know.

351
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:31,912
I couldn't even think. Oh, my
God, it was so embarrassing.

352
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,910
That was so...

353
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:37,950
I don't even have Jan's cell
phone number, and I hate her.

354
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:42,562
She won't give it to me. I was
like, "I guess I'm a loser."

355
00:15:42,964 --> 00:15:46,559
A loser!

356
00:15:47,035 --> 00:15:49,367
Too far! God!

357
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:53,968
Thanks a lot, man.
Thanks for the advice.

358
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,008
Enjoying your nut?

359
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:06,075
Why?
- Kevin.

360
00:16:06,154 --> 00:16:07,143
I'm not mocking.

361
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:10,816
I was just making an
observation about her nut.

362
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:12,450
I was.

363
00:16:12,527 --> 00:16:15,325
Hey, who wants to watch
Michael's pond dive?

364
00:16:15,396 --> 00:16:18,957
My roommate's friend is the
night janitor over there.

365
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:22,696
He swiped the security tape for
me, and he's bringing it over.

366
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,570
Mmm. You know what? Maybe we
should go easy on Michael, guys.

367
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:27,665
You know,
you watch that tape,

368
00:16:27,742 --> 00:16:31,337
and you're going to have to stay late
for more sensitivity training, so.

369
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:33,312
We'll stay late.
Yeah.

370
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:37,009
You are not a joke.

371
00:16:37,085 --> 00:16:38,109
I am.

372
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:39,244
You are smart.

373
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,344
Jim is smarter than me.

374
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:42,389
You are handsome.
Jim is more handsome.

375
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:47,360
No, Jim is ugly. Please. I mean, I'd
give anything for his nose. It's true.

376
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:50,022
The rest of him, God,
he looks like Popeye's wife.

377
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:52,032
Wow, Wilma.

378
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,834
See, that is funny.
That is a joke.

379
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:57,530
I know jokes
and you are not a joke.

380
00:16:58,506 --> 00:16:59,973
Her name's not Wilma.

381
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,807
Stop making me laugh.

382
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:04,302
Well, that went
pretty well.

383
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:05,368
Yeah, I guess.

384
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:07,471
We got a maybe.
It was our first maybe.

385
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,517
Going by the Nard-Dog curve,
I'd say we nailed it.

386
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:11,574
If I'm being
completely honest,

387
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:13,279
I could have done
without the belly kiss.

388
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:14,912
You know what?
I'm sorry,

389
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:18,254
'cause in that moment, I knew I
was kissing your belly too much.

390
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,725
Yeah, way too much.
Yeah.

391
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:21,557
I mean, what the hell was that?

392
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,028
What the heck was that?

393
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:24,086
When you cried.

394
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,690
Try "almost cried." Okay?

395
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:28,702
I just got caught
up in the fantasy.

396
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,001
Your fantasy involves comparison
shopping birthing classes?

397
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:35,338
No. I know I'm going
to go with Miss Janet.

398
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,743
I just... I don't know, it
was fun to role-play, right?

399
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:39,837
Hmm.

400
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:43,350
It was fun for me, having
a wife and a little baby.

401
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:46,817
I'm so sick of
being single.

402
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:49,186
Well, are you
dating anyone?

403
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:52,988
What do you think of Erin?
I mean, she's kind of cool.

404
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:55,988
You think
I can do better?

405
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:00,159
Got to get my
going out on.

406
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:02,425
Hey, let's watch
this thing.

407
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:03,970
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
okay, yeah.

408
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:05,130
We're not watching this.

409
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:06,571
How can we
not watch this?

410
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:08,131
What happened
to "Do not mock"?

411
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:09,642
We're not mocking,
we're watching.

412
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,678
That will inevitably
lead to mocking, so.

413
00:18:11,746 --> 00:18:13,008
Well, we'll
deal with it as it comes.

414
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:14,241
Is this the tape
of me falling?

415
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:15,407
Yes, put the DVD in.
Yep.

416
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:16,882
Open up QuickTime.
It starts on its own.

417
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,816
No, use QuickTime,
trust me, I've done this.

418
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,945
Guys, Michael
can't handle this.

419
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:23,354
And as your boss, I'm
saying, we're not watching it.

420
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:26,086
No, it's okay, watch it.
He can't fire all of you.

421
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,184
What are you doing?

422
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:28,694
It's all right.
I can handle it.

423
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,094
No.
I am a grownup, Jim.

424
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:31,153
It's on.

425
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:32,221
There they come.

426
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:35,633
Boom!

427
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,398
Oh! Did you see that? See what?

428
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,734
Wait, why did
you stop it?

429
00:18:38,806 --> 00:18:40,535
Oscar, yes, you're right to stop it.

430
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:41,870
Thank you, eject it.

431
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:43,740
Jim, you let
Michael fall in.

432
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:44,937
Play it again.

433
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:51,141
He purposefully
leaned away and let you fall.

434
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:53,444
Oh, man!

435
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:59,756
I think when I started to see
you go in, I think I just froze.

436
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:01,795
I don't think
you froze.

437
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:06,563
It's a killer
new dance move.

438
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:09,996
Do you want
to talk in your office?

439
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:11,095
No.

440
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:15,172
I didn't ask you.
Would you like to talk?

441
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,176
Judas.

442
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:20,942
Jim is my enemy,
but it turns out

443
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:23,142
that Jim is also
his own worst enemy.

444
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:27,847
And the enemy of my enemy is my
friend, so Jim is actually my friend.

445
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:32,657
But, because he is
his own worst enemy,

446
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:34,524
the enemy of my
friend is my enemy,

447
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:36,722
so actually
Jim is my enemy.

448
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:38,554
But...

449
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:41,730
I should have
grabbed you. I'm sorry.

450
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:46,603
Look, I thought I could have
done today's sales call alone.

451
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:49,201
I mean, I may never be as
good a salesman as you are,

452
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:52,269
but I at least need
the chance to do the job.

453
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,645
Jim is jealous of me?

454
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:00,783
Jim is jealous of me.

455
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:06,484
Hey, what's up,
lifeguard?

456
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:08,529
Jim, I think
I'm in your way.

457
00:20:15,469 --> 00:20:17,096
Oscar's a douche.

458
00:20:19,674 --> 00:20:21,073
He's all right.
No.

459
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:23,406
He's... Yeah,
he's all right.

460
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:27,239
Okay.

461
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:33,147
Thanks, Michael.
You're welcome.

462
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,719
Whoa! Almost fell.

463
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:44,521
Hey, Erin, do you mind
faxing this for me? Oh, sure.

464
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,328
Wait, hand them
to me upside down,

465
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,834
so I don't accidentally read them.

466
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,694
Okay.
Thanks.

467
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:51,795
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:54,534
How did today go, by the way?
Did you make any sales?

469
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:57,009
No, it was a total
waste of time.

470
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:01,272
It was fun, though,

471
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:02,907
because I got
to spend the day

472
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:05,248
with Andy Bernard
and he's really cool.

473
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,684
Yeah, he is.

474
00:21:06,754 --> 00:21:08,051
Yeah, he is.

475
00:21:08,122 --> 00:21:10,283
He's like the coolest
person I've ever met.

476
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:12,223
That's right.

477
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:15,295
He's like Marlon Brando.

478
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:21,433
Oh, do you mean Marlon
Wayans? 'Cause he is.

479
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:24,671
I actually do mean
Marlon Wayans. Yeah.
