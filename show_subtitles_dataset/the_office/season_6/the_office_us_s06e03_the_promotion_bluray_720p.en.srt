1
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:05,611
Could you please sign
my expense report?

2
00:00:05,687 --> 00:00:08,713
No way, no how. Expense
reports are a day-to-day item.

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:12,784
That is Jim's now. I am
exclusively big picture. Epic.

4
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,866
Sign this.
Uh-uh-uh.

5
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:24,872
Where's the please?
We're not animals.

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,464
Sign it.

7
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:27,873
No. Not without a please.

8
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:30,538
Idiot.

9
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,845
I have a complaint
about Jim.

10
00:00:35,918 --> 00:00:37,943
That is not
big picture.

11
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:43,390
I would like to file a huge,
enormous, massive complaint

12
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:46,257
about the tallest guy
in our office.

13
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:52,859
Okay.

14
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:55,398
Jim won't sign
my expense report.

15
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,598
That is not...
Okay. Day-to-day.

16
00:00:57,673 --> 00:00:59,334
That is day-to-day.
No. That is huge.

17
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:02,969
You're trying to trick me. Get out,
get out, get out, get out, get out.

18
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:07,972
I'd like to lodge
a complaint.

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,280
I'm sorry to hear about that.
Who is this about?

20
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:11,478
You.
Okay.

21
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:14,147
Just want to let you know I
take complaints very seriously,

22
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:16,657
so, when did
this happen?

23
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:17,749
One minute ago.

24
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:20,090
Okay. And how
do you feel?

25
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,186
Angry.

26
00:01:21,263 --> 00:01:23,197
All right. Did he hit you? No.

27
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:24,994
Did you cry?
No.

28
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:26,398
Did you feel like crying? No.

29
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:29,198
I'm just going to write,
"Held back tears."

30
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,432
Wait, stop writing that.
That is not true.

31
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:32,701
If you stop crying,
I'll stop writing it.

32
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:33,866
I'm not...

33
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,074
I deserved that
promotion. Not Jim.

34
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:42,174
Oh, man, makes me want to put
him in a triangle choke hold

35
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:44,378
and force him
down to the ground

36
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:46,512
and just keep
pressing and pressing,

37
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:51,355
and then flip him over and then put
him in a hammerlock and he's gasping.

38
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:53,417
He's panting for
every last breath.

39
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:57,898
And the crowd is going crazy
and boom, I emerge victorious!

40
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:01,932
Eighteen thousand dollars
and a chance at the title!

41
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:06,267
Dwight, Jim wants you
to keep it down.

42
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:43,303
Everyone, now would be
a good time to freshen up

43
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,675
because I'd like
everyone to meet

44
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:46,304
in the conference room
in five minutes.

45
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:47,746
And I suggest that
you bring a snack

46
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:49,249
because we may be
in there for a while.

47
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:50,342
Michael.
Yes.

48
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:52,011
Can I talk to you in my
office for a second? Mmm...

49
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:55,215
Sure. But could I first
talk to you in my office?

50
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,084
Can I also be a boss?

51
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:01,595
Look, it doesn't
take a genius to know

52
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:05,030
that any organization thrives
when it has two leaders.

53
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:08,434
Go ahead, name a country that
doesn't have two presidents.

54
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:11,267
A boat that set sail
without two captains.

55
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,207
Where would Catholicism be
without the popes?

56
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:15,709
I have noticed
that we...

57
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:17,142
Welcome.

58
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:18,941
Thank you. I have
noticed we've been having

59
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:21,005
a lot of conference
room meetings. Mmm-hmm.

60
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,246
And I'm wondering if
perhaps those are a bit...

61
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,411
Disruptive.
Yes.

62
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:29,947
No. I don't think they are. I think
the meetings are very important.

63
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:32,255
Okay. Maybe we
should talk specifics.

64
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:33,954
Let's do.
Okay.

65
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:36,896
Yesterday we had
a meeting about planets.

66
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:41,732
Well, to be fair,
Jim, James... Jimothy.

67
00:03:42,404 --> 00:03:45,430
To be fair, Jimothy...
That sounds weird.

68
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:46,599
Are you okay with
being called Jim?

69
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:47,835
I am.
All right.

70
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:49,171
Jim, to be fair,

71
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:50,541
the conversation
wasn't about planets.

72
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,636
Right.

73
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:53,271
At first, we were
talking about

74
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:55,816
introducing a line
of toilet paper.

75
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:57,010
And what part
of the human body

76
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:59,815
does one use
toilet paper upon?

77
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:03,188
So you draw a line from
there to the other planets,

78
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:04,725
and I think by the end, we all learned

79
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,590
a little bit about
how small we are.

80
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:07,822
Yes, I agree.
I just feel...

81
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,158
Because it's
a big universe.

82
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:12,530
And we're all just little
tiny specks of dust.

83
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:16,093
I just think that maybe they're
eating large amounts of the day.

84
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:18,366
You know what eats a large
amount of the day are naps.

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,670
You go to sleep, it's light
out, you wake up, it's dark.

86
00:04:20,742 --> 00:04:24,576
That's the whole day. Where
did that day go? I have no idea.

87
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:27,447
You mean
on a weekend?

88
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,608
Yes.

89
00:04:30,686 --> 00:04:32,415
How about this?
I think our goal should be

90
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:35,251
we don't have meetings unless
they're absolutely essential.

91
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:38,020
All right. No more
meetings this week.

92
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,755
Really?
You just agree to that?

93
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:42,456
I can be very
surprising.

94
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:50,631
What's going on?

95
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:53,197
I need to fit into
my wedding dress.

96
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:55,333
However,
I'm also pregnant.

97
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:00,738
You know, it's a myth
that women have to gain

98
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:03,080
more than nine pounds
in a pregnancy.

99
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:06,348
Look at these actresses.
Some of them lose weight.

100
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:10,019
Hey, did you guys register
for wedding gifts?

101
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:13,152
We did, but mostly because
people expect us to.

102
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:17,692
We're also accepting other
gifts not on the registry.

103
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,200
However much.

104
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:25,296
It's awkward asking people for
money. But we could really use it.

105
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:30,911
Why doesn't Crate and Barrel let you
register for a toaster full of cash?

106
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,640
Perfect.
I hate registries.

107
00:05:32,714 --> 00:05:33,772
Oh, good.

108
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,808
My cousin makes the most amazing
romantic birdhouse mailboxes.

109
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:41,185
I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll
still be surprised when you see it.

110
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,486
You're not registered
for a birdhouse, are you?

111
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,025
No, we're not.

112
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:46,526
Good. Good.

113
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,996
Mmm-hmm.

114
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:55,933
Okay. I thought
I saw people missing.

115
00:05:56,004 --> 00:06:00,031
Yeah. Just focus grouping a product
expansion idea to these folks.

116
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:01,598
Got one of each.
Really?

117
00:06:01,676 --> 00:06:03,075
Hey, Stanley, what was
the last thing Michael said

118
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:04,169
before I came
through the door?

119
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:05,474
Stanley, you don't
need to answer that.

120
00:06:05,547 --> 00:06:06,912
Stanley?

121
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:08,950
"If you don't smell
this, you're fired."

122
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:10,507
Okay, Michael,
I thought we agreed

123
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:12,746
to not take up people's time
with meetings like these.

124
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:15,722
What do you mean
by "these" people?

125
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,190
Michael, this is a
conference room meeting.

126
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:20,455
Oh, hey, everybody, I think
that Jim has gone insane

127
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:23,020
because he thinks that my
office is a conference room.

128
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:24,087
That's not
what I meant.

129
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,567
Listen, Jim, no offense,
but when push comes to shove,

130
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:30,127
what I want is more
important than what you want.

131
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:31,331
I disagree.

132
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:32,464
What do you
guys think?

133
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,168
Can
I go back to my desk now?

134
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,233
Great. Guys, can I just have a
moment alone with Michael, please?

135
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:37,903
No, no, no, no. You
don't need to go anywhere.

136
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,571
Anything that Jim
has to say to me,

137
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:41,843
he can say in front of
these types of people.

138
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,817
That is not what I said.

139
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:45,409
And also,
I am co-manager,

140
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:47,182
meaning you are not
the only manager anymore.

141
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:48,620
I am also a co-manager.

142
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,918
That is not what
Wallace told us.

143
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:51,117
That's exactly what
Wallace told us.

144
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,627
That is not the way
I heard it.

145
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,129
I love rivalries.
Michael or Jim,

146
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:59,895
Paris or Nicole, Heidi
or L.C., it's so much fun.

147
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,959
But I guess if I'm
really thinking about it,

148
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:03,971
and answering your
question honestly,

149
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:08,533
I'd have to go with L.C. Heidi's a
bad friend and her skin is terrible.

150
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,670
It is one thing me giving
you the co-manager title,

151
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:13,873
it is another thing
you bossing me around.

152
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:14,938
I'm not bossing you around.

153
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,211
I'm trying to do my job,
which is sharing your job.

154
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:19,116
So maybe we should
just call David Wallace.

155
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:21,314
No, no, no. No! We will
not call David Wallace.

156
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:22,720
I will call
David Wallace.

157
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,725
David Wallace is on
line two for you guys.

158
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:27,921
Or David Wallace will call us
on line two. Why don't we just...

159
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:29,793
Hey, David. You got
Jim here. Hey, David.

160
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:31,992
This is Michael,
senior co-manager.

161
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,628
Hey, guys. I'm
calling because unfortunately

162
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,699
we will not be
able to give out

163
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,331
cost of living
raises this year

164
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:42,239
and I know
people expect it.

165
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:45,370
However, there just is only a small
amount of money for each branch.

166
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,745
So, we're leaving
it up to the managers

167
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:49,306
to decide how
to distribute it.

168
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:53,445
Got it, Dave. Sounds like your
classic big picture decision.

169
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:56,286
Which will clearly affect the
day-to-day wellbeing of our employees.

170
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:57,586
It's probably
a little of both.

171
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:58,717
Which is it more of?

172
00:07:58,793 --> 00:07:59,885
Excuse me?
Hey, David,

173
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,223
I know that I am
very new at this,

174
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:03,287
but I have a very good
perspective on how things work...

175
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,664
Wait, I'm sorry. Michael,
are you texting me?

176
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,329
I thought maybe we could
talk after this is over.

177
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:12,498
Look, I need you both
to take care of this.

178
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,701
This is not going to
be a problem, is it?

179
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:15,765
Nope, not at all.
Not at all. Nope.

180
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:16,868
No, it will not be.

181
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:17,934
I am on top of it.
Very good.

182
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,776
All right. Thanks a lot,
David. Talk to you later...

183
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,612
Okay, you didn't
let me say goodbye.

184
00:08:23,985 --> 00:08:26,249
All right, I am looking
forward to this.

185
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:27,345
You don't have to lie.

186
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:30,016
I hate the fact that we have
to do this together.

187
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:31,956
I think we work
much better separately.

188
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:36,157
When I am irritated and I look
at you, I don't see you anymore.

189
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:37,562
Right.
All I can see

190
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,964
is how big and gross
the pores on your nose are.

191
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:42,230
All right.
Let's get started.

192
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,942
Hey, why haven't we ever...

193
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,240
We have.

194
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:57,808
You know, there's no
easy way to do this.

195
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:01,447
I say we add 1.5%
to their paychecks

196
00:09:01,523 --> 00:09:03,388
and don't say
anything about it.

197
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,517
Do you mean, like, break in,
in the middle of the night

198
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:06,822
and change the numbers
on payroll?

199
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:08,419
No, we can do it
during the day.

200
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:09,929
It doesn't have to be
that dramatic, Jim.

201
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:11,363
Okay.

202
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:15,961
You know what would help is a
pros and cons list for our options.

203
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:17,861
Jim, don't take this
the wrong way.

204
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:19,907
Are you going to take
this the wrong way?

205
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:20,999
It's hard to tell so far.

206
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,407
You use your brain
too much.

207
00:09:22,477 --> 00:09:24,274
I'm sorry, are you
advocating that I use it less?

208
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:27,440
Sometimes the smartest
people don't think at all.

209
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,312
You just came up with
that. As I was saying it.

210
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:30,715
Yeah.

211
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:35,347
Okay, so for the 1.5% increase,
pro, everyone gets a little bit.

212
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:37,254
Con, you look
like a nerd.

213
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:40,089
Con, no one gets as much
as they did last year.

214
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:43,426
Pro, you get to share your pros
and cons list with the other nerds.

215
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:45,295
Pro, no favoritism.

216
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,268
Con, you unzip your pants
and you'll find

217
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,236
that there's a calculator down there.

218
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,402
I've been studying
Michael for years

219
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:56,603
and I've condensed what
I've learned into this chart.

220
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,236
How Michael
spends his time.

221
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:01,180
As you can see, we have
procrastinating and distracting others.

222
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:04,412
And this tiny sliver here
is critical thinking.

223
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,988
I made it bigger so that
you could see it.

224
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:14,618
Hey, Pam. I heard that you were
registered, but I didn't hear where.

225
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:20,290
I don't think we registered
anywhere. We just want cash.

226
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:24,867
Like money? Like,
you want my money?

227
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,234
Mmm-hmm.

228
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:28,306
Will you take a check?

229
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:29,867
Yeah.

230
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:30,933
Cool.

231
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:38,311
In the memo line, I'm going to
write, "To love's eternal glory."

232
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:40,677
Okay.

233
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:41,949
Wait till Monday.

234
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:48,258
Is this what I've become?
Materialistic? Shallow?

235
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:54,257
I feel horrible. Oh,
look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!"

236
00:10:55,403 --> 00:10:58,463
That's the first time
I've seen it in writing.

237
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,074
You know what,
the more I think about it,

238
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:04,270
the more I think we should
give it to the salesmen.

239
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:05,607
That will not
go over well.

240
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,307
Yeah, I know, I just
think it seems smart

241
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:09,009
to keep the salesmen
happier right now.

242
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:11,279
Of course, I know this
might come off as biased,

243
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:13,786
so you know what?
Let us...

244
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:15,288
Oh, my God,
are you going to make

245
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:16,983
another pro and con list?
I'm going to kill myself.

246
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:18,821
Well, I'm not going to let
you stop me from thinking.

247
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:20,793
No, I could not
do that, Jim.

248
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:23,057
I can see it in your
crusty little eyes

249
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,258
that you are going to make
everything perfect.

250
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,131
"If I could just
think this through,

251
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:30,831
"if I could just
think it exactly right,

252
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:33,169
"I can make this perfect.

253
00:11:33,808 --> 00:11:35,776
"And then I can go
down every avenue,

254
00:11:35,844 --> 00:11:37,903
"and every avenue
off of that avenue.

255
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:39,469
"And then another avenue..." Michael.

256
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:40,536
"And then another."

257
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:41,809
Look, you have
a lot of strengths.

258
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:43,783
Oh, I do?
Tell me what they are.

259
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:46,343
I think that you
are able to take

260
00:11:46,421 --> 00:11:47,752
constructive criticism
very well.

261
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:50,689
Ha! That, I am not
known for that.

262
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,590
But there is a reason
why I'm here.

263
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,321
Yes, you went over
my head to Wallace.

264
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:56,886
No, it's because you also have
a lot of weaknesses, Michael.

265
00:11:56,965 --> 00:12:00,731
Okay, well, why don't you
tell me what those are, Jim?

266
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,235
Why don't you
enliven me?

267
00:12:02,303 --> 00:12:04,032
I don't think you're good
at making tough decisions.

268
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:05,129
Ah!

269
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:08,642
At thinking out the options and then
stating that decision very clearly,

270
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,678
especially when it's
an unpopular decision.

271
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:14,044
Okay. Here's a tough decision
for you, you suck. You suck.

272
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:15,810
Michael, wait. Is that
clear enough for you?

273
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:21,186
Maybe I'm here for a reason, because
I might have some good ideas, too.

274
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:23,486
I've been sitting out there
and I've been learning a lot

275
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:26,686
and maybe I can just bring
something different to the table.

276
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:28,194
Okay, Skippy, here we go.

277
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:31,494
Why don't you run yourself
out there and tell them?

278
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,532
You call it.

279
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:41,474
This had better be terrible.

280
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,033
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

281
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:46,103
I have some tough news, so I'm just
going to give it to you straight.

282
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:49,048
Truth is we only have so much
money for raises this year.

283
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:50,106
So the simple fact is,

284
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,585
some people will get raises
and some people won't.

285
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:54,246
Now what
we've decided is

286
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,950
we are going to give those
raises to the sales staff.

287
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,322
Wait, seriously?

288
00:12:58,393 --> 00:13:01,556
Look, you guys are smart,
so I'm just leveling with you,

289
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:03,119
just trying to treat
you like adults.

290
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,599
Thank you, Jim, for thinking
that we're smart people.

291
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:08,295
But I do not understand.

292
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:11,770
If we're such smart adults,
then why don't we get raises?

293
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,535
Excellent question,
genius.

294
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:15,200
It's because Jim wants
to give the raises

295
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:17,141
to his friends and the
people he sleeps with.

296
00:13:17,212 --> 00:13:18,270
Ooh! Easy,
that's not it at all.

297
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,335
Well?

298
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:20,813
Really, what it is,
is about the money

299
00:13:20,882 --> 00:13:22,509
the sales staff brings
in to the office...

300
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:23,573
What's going on?

301
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:26,484
Jim is only giving raises
to the salesmen.

302
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:28,519
What the hell? Why are
you being such a jerk?

303
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,252
Hold on, Kelly, would it help you
to know that Jim thinks you're smart?

304
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:34,557
No. How is that going
to repair Ryan's car?

305
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:37,154
This is ridiculous!
How can he do this to us?

306
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,426
Okay, Dwight,
you know what?

307
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:39,727
You'd be getting
the raise, so...

308
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:42,497
What about all these people?
How is it fair to them?

309
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,662
- Exactly.
- Totally.

310
00:13:43,738 --> 00:13:46,298
We work just as hard as the
salespeople, we deserve raises.

311
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:47,363
Yes.
Yes.

312
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,069
They don't get them
if we don't get them.

313
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:52,806
My kid needs shoes. You want to
tell him he doesn't get shoes?

314
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:53,870
Yeah.

315
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:55,245
Her kid needs shoes, Jim.

316
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:56,806
What the hell?

317
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,924
Wow. I'm just going to rewind
and back off a bit, so...

318
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,734
That was good.
That was good.

319
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,428
Okay, all right.
Well, we all know

320
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:19,837
it's hard to be
a boss, right?

321
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:23,901
You know what? Look around you,
these are your best friends.

322
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:29,146
These are the people who
will open their hearts to you.

323
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:33,449
They all have
heart-ons for you.

324
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:35,751
And that is a gift.

325
00:14:36,257 --> 00:14:39,658
So in terms of gifts, we should
be giving each other gifts.

326
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:43,288
Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar.

327
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,729
This is... What are you
talking about? Michael!

328
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,632
We just need to hear
your plan for our raise.

329
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:51,968
My plan, a man, Panama.

330
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,036
That's not how that goes.

331
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:57,043
You're not saying anything. At
least Jim was being direct...

332
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:58,100
Thank you, Meredith.

333
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,737
when he was telling us
his dumbass plan.

334
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,179
We would just like
to know what's happening.

335
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,240
Are we getting a raise,
yes or no?

336
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,650
All right, let me get this cleared.
Does everybody want a raise?

337
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,914
Yes!

338
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:08,819
All right,
everyone wants a raise,

339
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,654
so what we're going
to do is go into here

340
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,853
and we will not
come out until we do.

341
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:15,623
Again, that gives us
no information.

342
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,791
This isn't a game,
you know, it's our livelihood.

343
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:24,070
What about a raise
based on merit?

344
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,901
Rank each person
individually.

345
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,839
Mmm-hmm.
Piece of cake.

346
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,909
Ryan is obviously
the best.

347
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:31,673
Obviously.
Too bad he's a temp

348
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:33,179
and doesn't count,
so let's get started.

349
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:34,544
Are you making a...

350
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:36,640
Nope, I'm numbering the paper.

351
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:38,583
Just...
Yeah. I don't understand

352
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:41,019
how they can even
consider giving money

353
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:43,421
to some people
and not the rest of us.

354
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:45,891
It's not like we're not going to
see the checks, we're in Accounting.

355
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,723
I am so pissed
at this company.

356
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:48,784
And Jim.

357
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,990
Yeah.
Who said that?

358
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,127
I think it was Creed.

359
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:54,190
Yep.

360
00:15:58,873 --> 00:16:00,738
It's going really
well, actually. Mmm-hmm.

361
00:16:00,808 --> 00:16:03,538
Each Boston baked bean
represents half-a-percent raise.

362
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:04,600
We each got 24 beans,

363
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,011
so the idea is,
you place the bean

364
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:09,914
on the picture of who
you think deserves...

365
00:16:09,984 --> 00:16:11,781
Who's that?
Toby.

366
00:16:11,853 --> 00:16:13,218
Okay, he's not a part
of this, you know that.

367
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,221
Just wanted to draw
a picture of him.

368
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:16,688
Okay, your move.

369
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,316
All right. Who to pick?

370
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,284
Who to pick?

371
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:21,385
Here we go.

372
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:25,364
I will skip a turn.

373
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,594
Okay, you're going to still have
to play that bean, you know that.

374
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:28,999
I need more time.

375
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,137
Wallace sent an email
about a meeting next week,

376
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:40,442
he wants you
both to respond.

377
00:16:57,331 --> 00:17:00,528
People are starting to notice
how terrible Jim is.

378
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,968
It's great. Eventually,
they will rise up and revolt.

379
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,269
My only hope is that they do
it sooner rather than later.

380
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:09,536
If the people here were
our Founding Fathers,

381
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,408
the Revolutionary War would
have been delayed 10 years

382
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,643
because Stanley Washington
was napping.

383
00:17:15,716 --> 00:17:20,050
And Phyllis Hancock was
still signing the Declaration,

384
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:24,285
and Kevin Jefferson was
distracted by a butterfly.

385
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:29,022
Come on in. That's right.
Come in, feast your eyes.

386
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:33,397
They determine our worth
by putting beans on our faces.

387
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:34,492
What the hell?

388
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:36,935
Things were not this bad
when just Michael was manager.

389
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:38,403
Hey, what are you guys
doing in here?

390
00:17:38,473 --> 00:17:39,701
What does a bean mean?

391
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:44,404
Why aren't there any beans on this
very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?

392
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,811
Michael,
what does a bean mean?

393
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:47,939
Jim?

394
00:17:48,015 --> 00:17:49,039
I was just trying
to be unbiased.

395
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:50,448
What does a bean mean?

396
00:17:50,518 --> 00:17:51,610
Someone please
explain it to Kevin.

397
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:54,211
Why can't you? My time is
just as valuable as yours.

398
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,017
Not according
to the beans.

399
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,490
This is how you make
this important decision?

400
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,757
There's no way that Stanley
gets more beans than me, that is ridiculous.

401
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,828
This is how it works.

402
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,568
It's not so much that I might
not get a raise, it's just demeaning.

403
00:18:09,637 --> 00:18:14,506
Thank you. That is exactly... But,
by the way, I would also like a raise.

404
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:16,338
Yeah, I would, too.

405
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,877
Are we idiots?

406
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:23,482
What right does
Jim have to claim authority?

407
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:26,313
Is he as good
a salesman as I?

408
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:29,288
Is he as matronly
as Phyllis?

409
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:33,386
There are moments where
we can affect change.

410
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:38,455
For a few seconds,
every decade, we exist.

411
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,294
And these are those seconds.
Let us storm his castle.

412
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,204
Come on, tick,
let's get him, tock.

413
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,978
Let's get Jim. Tick, and drag
Jim out of his office, tock,

414
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:55,413
take his keys away from
him, tick, that's a clock.

415
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:58,919
The time is getting very
close. It's now or never.

416
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:00,476
What say you?

417
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:02,948
I say no.

418
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:05,686
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan?

419
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,592
Michael Scott...
Security guard.

420
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:12,155
Michael,
will you help us?

421
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:15,701
What does
a bean mean?

422
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,008
How you doing?

423
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,068
On a scale of one to 10,
I'd say I'm about a four.

424
00:19:25,947 --> 00:19:27,346
What are you usually?

425
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,315
Six. You?

426
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:32,216
Usually a 10, but I'm
feeling like a zero.

427
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:33,844
I mean,
a performance-based raise

428
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:35,354
sounded like
a good idea, right?

429
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:36,947
I know, I know.

430
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,491
We tried to find
the fairest way to do it.

431
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,617
Yes, we did.

432
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:41,059
I just...

433
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:45,490
What?

434
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,026
Um...

435
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:49,192
Nothing. I just...

436
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,933
I used to have to do this part
alone. And it was the worst.

437
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:58,136
I have something
I would like to give you.

438
00:19:58,212 --> 00:20:00,703
Michael, come on!
This isn't fair! KEVIN: Michael!

439
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,718
Michael's my only friend
left in the office.

440
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:08,585
Except Pam. I think.

441
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,018
She still upset?

442
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:15,390
Michael, you cannot
just keep avoiding us like this.

443
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,788
Thank you.

444
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:20,856
You're welcome.

445
00:20:23,037 --> 00:20:24,527
What's in here?

446
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:25,663
Gin.

447
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,641
Ooh.

448
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:46,317
Just
pretend we're not here.

449
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,789
Heard you guys are looking
for cash for the wedding?

450
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,164
Yeah, I mean, if it's
all the same for you.

451
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:55,259
Question for you,

452
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:59,466
would you guys rather have $100
now or $5,000 a year from now?

453
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,871
$100 now, for sure.

454
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:03,671
Because you just give me
$50 to cover the broker fee,

455
00:21:03,744 --> 00:21:06,212
I put in $100 of my
own money, as the gift.

456
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,807
Yeah. No, no. The $100.
I'll just take the $100.

457
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:13,319
Instead of
$5,000 a year from now?

458
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,280
How sure is this?

459
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:17,881
The guy has an algorithm

460
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,724
to determine the winner of any
given college basketball game.

461
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:29,234
Don't tell Jim.
