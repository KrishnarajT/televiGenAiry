1
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:04,485
This here is
a radon test kit.

2
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:06,020
Okay, I'll be
putting them everywhere.

3
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:08,648
And please don't
throw these out.

4
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:11,717
This is a radon test kit.

5
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:13,921
Please don't
throw these out.

6
00:00:15,664 --> 00:00:16,961
You'll see them
all over the office.

7
00:00:17,266 --> 00:00:19,359
Toby has been leaving
radon kits everywhere

8
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:21,359
like he owns the place.

9
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:25,871
The first time I threw mine away,
I thought it was an ant trap.

10
00:00:26,742 --> 00:00:28,300
But I figured I'd
rather live with ants

11
00:00:28,377 --> 00:00:30,277
than with this
creepy little disk.

12
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:34,248
The second time, I thought
it was one of those,

13
00:00:34,316 --> 00:00:38,252
you know, the things you turn
over and it moos like a cow thing,

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,917
but upon closer examination it was
another ant trap, so I threw it away.

15
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:48,726
And the third time,
I did it out of spite.

16
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,062
Come on, Michael,
you're interrupting.

17
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:54,864
You're kidding me! God!

18
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:56,996
You say radon is silent but
deadly and then you expect me

19
00:00:57,072 --> 00:00:59,097
not to make farting noises
with my mouth?

20
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:00,436
What is this?
Please sit down.

21
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:01,999
You know what, we're
not gonna die of radon,

22
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:03,339
we're gonna die of boredom.

23
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:04,401
Yeah.

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,538
Right?

25
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:07,707
And if I had a gun
with two bullets,

26
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:10,479
and I was in a room with
Hitler, Bin Laden and Toby,

27
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:12,383
I would shoot Toby twice.

28
00:01:13,889 --> 00:01:15,550
Okay, all right.
You were being really funny

29
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:16,613
and then you went too far.

30
00:01:16,692 --> 00:01:18,592
I would kill Bin Laden
and then Toby.

31
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:20,217
No. That's still...

32
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:22,229
Okay, geniuses,
how would you do it?

33
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:26,393
Curve the bullet like in my
favorite James McAvoy film Wanted.

34
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,560
All that does is help you
shoot around things.

35
00:01:28,637 --> 00:01:30,434
What does Bin Laden... Is
there a curtain rod in the room?

36
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:31,530
I don't know.

37
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:34,804
How about make-believe
land has anything you want?

38
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,936
Stanley, please,
this is serious.

39
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:39,941
Is this the thing where they use
an icicle so there's no evidence?

40
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:42,108
Yes, we should stab Toby
through the heart with an icicle.

41
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:44,015
Come on, the whole two
bullet thing is a red herring.

42
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:45,849
Here's how you do it.
You line them all up,

43
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:48,116
you take one bullet, shoot
them all through the throat

44
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,748
at the same time.

45
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:51,759
Watch this. Phyllis,
you're Hitler, come up here.

46
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:55,092
Toby, you're Toby. Andy,
you're Bin Laden. Line up.

47
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,688
- I don't want to do this.
- Throats together.

48
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:58,460
Toby, just do it!
Toby, come on.

49
00:01:58,534 --> 00:01:59,558
God.

50
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:01,626
Ready, one bullet and...

51
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,197
Boom!

52
00:02:06,809 --> 00:02:08,037
Yeah, that works.

53
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:09,769
It worked!

54
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:33,594
What flavors did you get?

55
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,159
It's so exciting, Pam.

56
00:02:35,237 --> 00:02:38,229
The Eagles are doing a theme of
ice creams in honor of turning 60.

57
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:41,970
"Despera-Dough, Witchy-Womanilla."
Why do they do this?

58
00:02:42,044 --> 00:02:43,136
Do you want me to
go back to the store?

59
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:45,772
No, no, no, it's fine.
I was just commenting.

60
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,015
We got to get these
out, open them up. Okay.

61
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,711
This is all for Michael. Turns
out his girlfriend was married.

62
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,981
Yeah, and when
Michael gets a broken heart,

63
00:02:53,055 --> 00:02:54,488
this whole place
comes to a halt,

64
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:56,820
so, we're just trying to
get out in front of this.

65
00:02:57,092 --> 00:03:00,255
After his last breakup, he ate
40,000 calories in three hours.

66
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:02,297
Right, Pam?
That's what Pam told me.

67
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:04,023
Yeah.

68
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,726
Or, no, well,
I don't know.

69
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,429
I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece.

70
00:03:08,504 --> 00:03:10,267
Otherwise I'd be
running this.

71
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:11,533
That's okay.

72
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,905
You probably shouldn't
keep a baby up that late.

73
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,434
We have Mr. Bean playing
in the conference room,

74
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:17,977
and the Pink Panther
movie in his office.

75
00:03:18,046 --> 00:03:19,479
With half hour shifts
to watch with him.

76
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:21,379
And we need bodies in
both these rooms, people.

77
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,439
So, please sign up.

78
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,879
He's coming.
- Oh. Okay.

79
00:03:23,952 --> 00:03:25,852
Everyone, remember
when he gets like this,

80
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,786
he will wallow
if you empathize.

81
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,118
Keep conversations light.

82
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:31,250
And if you get stuck and
you don't know what to do,

83
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:32,759
make a random
sound effect.

84
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,489
Okay, farting noise,
whatever. Okay.

85
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:36,855
Hey, everyone.
No, out.

86
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,160
Get out, right now.
Leave now.

87
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,530
Get out. Right now.

88
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,829
Please, please!

89
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,704
And if he makes a joke,
just laugh it up

90
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:45,501
no matter what, okay?

91
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:50,509
Morning, everyone.
- Hey!

92
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,637
Hey!

93
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:52,737
Hey!

94
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:53,940
Hello.

95
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:56,075
Michael,
nice tie or something.

96
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:58,512
Thank you.
It's reversible, I think.

97
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:01,752
That's hilarious. PAM: That's awesome.

98
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:02,915
You want some ice cream?

99
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,286
Oh! Wow. Are those
Eagles flavors?

100
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:08,795
"Cake It To The Limit,"
that's my favorite.

101
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:11,230
I love that. Too much
for me to have by myself.

102
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,597
Anybody want to share?

103
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:20,972
Okay, well... That's random.
I will dig into those later.

104
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,745
I don't follow this
exactly.

105
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:26,371
"The descendents
of any replicants

106
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:27,676
"from this union
shall have..."

107
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:28,773
Joint custody.
Joint custody.

108
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:32,182
Are we talking about
your grandchildren?

109
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:33,278
No.
No.

110
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:34,922
Rather than spend
all day in court,

111
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,050
we have decided to settle
our dispute using a mediator.

112
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:41,553
It was an option spelled out
in our child-rearing contract.

113
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,688
Alleged contract.

114
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:43,788
Alleged?

115
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,095
I'm going to own your farm
by the time this is over.

116
00:04:46,201 --> 00:04:49,796
Pfft. Yeah, just try. I
will do legal jujitsu on you.

117
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:50,895
Yeah.

118
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,166
See, don't even need to make
contact. The law will do it.

119
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:58,003
So much of this is
just impossible to verify.

120
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,379
Item five, point B,
the beet juice cleanse.

121
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,317
I'm doing it. You know
I am. It's disgusting.

122
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,115
How do we know this? I'd
like to see a stool sample.

123
00:05:06,188 --> 00:05:07,985
Dwight, look at my teeth.

124
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,115
Ugh!

125
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:11,952
No secret crying.

126
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,526
Hasn't even opened
the tissue box in there.

127
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,453
Could he still be seeing her?

128
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,122
I don't think he'd do that.

129
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,999
So, we're gonna say
the most likely scenario

130
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:22,002
is that Michael
matured overnight?

131
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,538
It happened to
Tom Hanks in Big.

132
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,469
Exactly.
It happened in Big.

133
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:30,638
No, I gotta go.
Text me later.

134
00:05:31,013 --> 00:05:32,810
I'm really too tired
to do this. Me, too.

135
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:34,542
Then let's just not do this.

136
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,982
Do you have any idea
of the risks involved?

137
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:39,379
Hey, Michael.
Hey.

138
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,922
We were wondering if you'd like
to have dinner with us tonight

139
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,924
in our home and
play with our baby?

140
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:45,584
We could order in
from Hooters.

141
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:47,159
Hooters to go, nice.

142
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,796
We can watch a movie
and play Rock Band.

143
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:49,956
Billy Joel Rock Band.

144
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,157
That exists?

145
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,291
Yes.

146
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:56,098
Okay, well, I'll have to take a
rain check, but thanks for the offer.

147
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:59,136
Michael Scott,
are you still seeing Donna?

148
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,768
Okay, Pam,

149
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:05,839
she's not invisible, so
stop asking silly questions.

150
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:07,006
Michael.

151
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:08,674
Since when is this an office

152
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,310
where we delve into
each other's personal lives?

153
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:12,876
I like Donna.

154
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:17,350
Is it wrong to
keep seeing her?

155
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:20,088
Depends on who you ask. I
mean, if you ask her husband

156
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:24,297
or you took a random poll,
yeah, it's wrong.

157
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,900
That is something
I would never do.

158
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,299
Well, I think we all know what
you're capable of, Meredith.

159
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,771
Hey, I have never cheated on, been
cheated on or been used to cheat with.

160
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:37,175
I ask everyone in the room,
"Are you in a relationship?"

161
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:39,974
People, this is Scranton

162
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:41,379
and many people
consider that to be

163
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,680
the Paris of
northeastern Pennsylvania.

164
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:46,619
And in Paris, it is rude for a
woman to have less than four lovers.

165
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:48,887
Ugh! Ryan, I do not want you
hanging out with Michael anymore.

166
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,082
Okay.

167
00:06:50,158 --> 00:06:52,786
Okay, I will have you know
that I asked Donna about this

168
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,123
and she is fine with it.

169
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,824
And just to be sure, I asked
her again afterward, same answer.

170
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:58,194
How does he feel about it?

171
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:00,063
He is never gonna find out.

172
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:01,830
He is a high school
baseball coach,

173
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,269
he wakes up early,
he goes to bed early.

174
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:07,941
Look at how long it took
for him to find out.

175
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,341
It was right under his nose.
I had to tell him.

176
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,879
Okay, now you're
just being hurtful.

177
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:13,244
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:16,542
Why is it okay for Stanley to
cheat? Or for Phyllis to cheat?

179
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:17,876
Hey.

180
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:19,011
On her diet.

181
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:21,687
He's a sports guy.
He's scummy.

182
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:23,857
Dog fighting,
drugs, they spit.

183
00:07:24,025 --> 00:07:25,458
Did Donna tell you that?

184
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:28,159
Real Sports with
Bryant Gumball.

185
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,664
So, you're just making a giant
assumption. You don't even know the guy.

186
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:32,097
You know what?
You know what?

187
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:35,193
I am declaring a moment
of silence right now.

188
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,068
Ten minutes of silence
honoring Michael Jackson.

189
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,007
Just sit there and think
about Michael Jackson.

190
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,035
My name's Andy Bernard
and I am a cuckold.

191
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,875
For those of you unfamiliar
with William Shakespeare,

192
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:48,438
a cuckold is a man whose
woman is cheating on him.

193
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:50,481
I've lived the part.

194
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,613
And let me tell you, I would so
much rather play the part on stage.

195
00:07:57,392 --> 00:08:00,793
So, here's the thing
about infidelity.

196
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:01,954
No, no.

197
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,521
When are you people going to
stop casting the first stone?

198
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,328
I am not in the wrong here.
I am the good guy.

199
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:09,300
How does that work?

200
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:13,374
Do you think this husband
is a super sweet, nice guy?

201
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:15,842
Do you think he's an angel?
I don't think so.

202
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:20,439
Why is his wife going off and having
a little something-something with me?

203
00:08:20,982 --> 00:08:24,179
There has to be
a problem with him.

204
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,253
In any cheating movie, the person
getting cheated on is the hero.

205
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:30,750
You're Ali Larter,
I'm Beyoncé.

206
00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:32,084
I am Beyoncé always.

207
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,889
Not this time.
Yes, I am.

208
00:08:34,496 --> 00:08:36,987
This guy's a high school
baseball coach, right?

209
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:38,862
Let's go check him out, see
what a horrible person he is.

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,627
I would love that.
Yeah.

211
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:43,000
Those teams have games and practices
every day. Let's go check it out.

212
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:44,667
I have work to do.

213
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,366
Really?
I thought you were the boss.

214
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:49,232
Let's go.

215
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:53,347
I can't wait to see this jerk who
is making me cheat on his wife.

216
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:54,575
I should punch him
in the nose

217
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:55,980
for what he's
making me do to her.

218
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,324
All right, Andy, please.

219
00:09:06,461 --> 00:09:07,792
Baseball!
Shh!

220
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,764
Try not to draw attention,
please.

221
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,291
That's him. That's him.

222
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:14,995
Where?
Right there.

223
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:16,261
The coach.

224
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,600
Stage right or stage left?

225
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,299
I played batboy
in Damn Yankees.

226
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:22,537
Right there. Look, look.
Follow my finger, okay? See?

227
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:24,539
The grownup by the base.

228
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:28,105
And now coaching third base
with two arms, two legs

229
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:30,344
and a heart capable
of feeling pain...

230
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:32,386
All right. Can you
just... Is number...

231
00:09:32,454 --> 00:09:34,684
Can you just act normal
for a second, please?

232
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:37,020
Whatever.
I'm the one blending in.

233
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:47,797
Guys?
Pam?

234
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,894
Hey. Oh! Hi, Gabe.

235
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:53,299
Can you two please join
me in my office? Now.

236
00:09:58,513 --> 00:09:59,946
You were supposed
to be the lookout.

237
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,984
Yeah, well, it's really warm in
here. It's like a sleeping bag.

238
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,876
I don't want to be the heavy
here, but honestly, guys,

239
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:07,421
this makes us all look bad.

240
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,623
Sorry about that.
So embarrassing.

241
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:14,152
Good, okay,
end of the dressing down.

242
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17,794
I just hate that part of the
job, you know? The power dynamic.

243
00:10:18,366 --> 00:10:19,924
Well, you were
surprisingly restrained.

244
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:21,559
We will be well
rested tomorrow.

245
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,659
Okay. That's great, actually,

246
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,602
because I wanted to talk
to you about something else.

247
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,337
Excellent. Go for it.

248
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,376
I'm sure you got my e-mail
about the printer fires,

249
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,502
the one with
the branching decision tree.

250
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,206
I actually
designed that chart.

251
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,975
Kind of hoping
it catches on.

252
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:35,914
Anyway, the question is,

253
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:38,782
what is the best way to
disseminate important information

254
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:40,150
in an efficient way?

255
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:43,753
Right. So let's...

256
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:45,789
Finally, there's a provision
here in the occurrence

257
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,623
that the child is
born an old man,

258
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:48,720
a la Benjamin Button.

259
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:50,594
Same page. Go to the next one.
Same page. We're fine there.

260
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:52,030
Just keep moving.

261
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,692
Despite
the provision covering

262
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,326
whether this is all
part of The Matrix...

263
00:10:55,503 --> 00:10:56,868
Which we can't know...

264
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:58,263
this is essentially...

265
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,329
unless we're unplugged...

266
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:02,406
equivalent to a donor
or surrogate contract...

267
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:04,043
and wake up in the future.

268
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,113
which is
actually pretty common.

269
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:09,480
So, I have to tell you that
this is a solid contract.

270
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,079
What?

271
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:15,054
Look, I can't enforce that anybody
have a child with anyone else.

272
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,279
What?

273
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:18,952
So essentially
this comes down to damages.

274
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:22,728
Now, there is some precedence
for the range of $30,000.

275
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:24,223
What?

276
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:26,926
I don't have
$30,000 lying around.

277
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,367
I have it buried very deeply,

278
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:31,269
and I don't want to dig past
a certain someone to get it.

279
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,831
Chase Dixon is up,
could be a big play.

280
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:36,035
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

281
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,408
I know it's like cricket.

282
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,707
No. No.

283
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,748
Well, home plate
is like a wicket.

284
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:43,010
You don't know,
you don't know anything.

285
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:45,650
Look at him.
Look at him over there.

286
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,621
High fiving?
He didn't even do anything.

287
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,317
The kid did all the work.

288
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:51,549
I bet he does that at home.

289
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:54,993
I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna,
why don't you wash the dishes?

290
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:56,553
"High five, Donna."

291
00:11:56,631 --> 00:12:00,465
"Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?
High five. I'm taking all the credit."

292
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:02,298
He seems pretty
well liked by the team.

293
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,703
Okay, well, that's because
he's paying their salary.

294
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,969
You do know that high school
coaches don't pay their players.

295
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,978
I know. I know. I know.

296
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,111
That was a euphemism.

297
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:15,443
$30,000?
There's got to be another way.

298
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,552
He has a 60-acre beet farm
that is worth a small fortune.

299
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,278
Look, I will not pay.

300
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,180
Well, I have an alternative.

301
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,525
"Intercourse to completion
five individual times

302
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:27,822
"rendered at my discretion."

303
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:29,363
Look, I don't think
that's actually legal.

304
00:12:29,464 --> 00:12:30,726
Agreed.

305
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:36,635
Five times for $30,000?
Not a bad stud fee.

306
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,434
Better than most horses.

307
00:12:38,773 --> 00:12:40,365
But not on your bed.
It's lumpy.

308
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,535
Those lumps are cats,
and those cats have names,

309
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,374
and those names are Amber,
Milky Way, Dianne and Lumpy.

310
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:47,178
Fine, five times.

311
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,307
Look, I can't legally
watch this unfold.

312
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:51,511
It's coming a little dangerously
close to prostitution.

313
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,048
I want eye contact.

314
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:54,213
No.
Yes.

315
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,154
Do you understand how rare
that is in nature?

316
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:57,657
I'm not some farm animal.

317
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,954
Great game, Coach.
Shh.

318
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:04,760
Okay, all right,
don't, don't, don't.

319
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:08,466
You guys are awesome. Best
game I've ever seen in my life.

320
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,604
Yeah, right. You must be
rooting for the other guys.

321
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:12,469
Ha! The other guys
can go die.

322
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,529
Okay.
Baseball!

323
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:14,632
Go talk to him.

324
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:16,142
No, God,
you go talk to him.

325
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:19,843
Shane, great game, man.

326
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:22,240
Do I know you?

327
00:13:22,317 --> 00:13:23,341
No, just big fans.

328
00:13:23,618 --> 00:13:24,949
Both of us.

329
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,213
Are you somebody's
parents?

330
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:30,655
Are you guys Kenny's dads?

331
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:34,195
No, no,
but we're gay for baseball.

332
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,726
Okay.
But I have a wife, actually,

333
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,527
who I really love a lot.
Yeah.

334
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,760
Okay.

335
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:40,858
Let's go!

336
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:42,732
I am so into the
institution of marriage.

337
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,169
Isn't marriage the best,
you know?

338
00:13:45,373 --> 00:13:46,897
Two good people
finding each other,

339
00:13:46,975 --> 00:13:48,966
getting all committed to
each other.

340
00:13:50,445 --> 00:13:52,106
You love baseball,
what else do you love?

341
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,908
Let's round you out
as a person.

342
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:56,778
Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just
trying to focus here on the game.

343
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:59,752
I get it, man. I love it. That's
what makes you a good coach.

344
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:03,088
You know, but as a fan, it just
helps me enjoy the game better

345
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:05,649
if I know
the coach loves his wife.

346
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,654
Of course. Okay, I've
got to get back to this.

347
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,788
Of course.
All right.

348
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:12,662
But real quick, I want you
to meet my associate. Sheldon!

349
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:14,429
No, no, no. I'm good.
- Come on, get over here.

350
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:16,265
Get over here.
Oh, my God. All right.

351
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:18,464
Sheldon, say hi
to the nice coach.

352
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,802
Sorry, I've got
some stomach cramps.

353
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:21,803
It's all right, it's
all right, just keep it going.

354
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,901
Well, that was not at all
what I expected.

355
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:27,474
My heart's still racing.

356
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:30,479
I just looked a man in the
eyes and I shook his hand.

357
00:14:30,552 --> 00:14:33,646
All the time I was thinking,
"I'm sleeping with your wife."

358
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:36,780
You know who does that?
James freaking Bond.

359
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,959
Okay, orange slices.

360
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:42,496
There you go.
Thanks, Michael.

361
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:45,226
Don't thank me,
thank Dylan's mom.

362
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,460
There you go.

363
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:49,503
Why would you throw
something wet at me?

364
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:50,663
You love it.

365
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:51,932
There you go.

366
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:53,800
Now, were those
for the team?

367
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:56,743
No. They didn't say "team,"
they just said "Coal Hawks."

368
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:58,640
I don't think those
were yours to take.

369
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:00,203
Well, then, it wouldn't
be the first time

370
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,215
I stole something
away from Coach Shane.

371
00:15:02,584 --> 00:15:03,778
I just want to
go on record as saying

372
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:06,082
that I do not
condone this affair.

373
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:07,917
And I even went so
far as to force Michael

374
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:10,116
to confront
the victim of his behavior.

375
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:12,216
Did you talk to him?
I did.

376
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:15,194
You talked to the man whose wife
you're having an affair with?

377
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:16,958
Wow, that is crazy.

378
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:18,089
Was there a fist fight?

379
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,691
No, we just talked.
He's very nice.

380
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:21,962
And it didn't
change your mind?

381
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:23,128
It did not.

382
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:24,227
Michael, that's awful.

383
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:25,294
Isn't it?

384
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:26,670
Yes.
I'm awful, aren't I?

385
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:27,833
Yeah, that's pretty...

386
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:29,308
I'm an awful guy. Ooh!

387
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:30,605
How can you
live with yourself?

388
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:32,578
I am what I am, Oscar.

389
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:36,373
And I want what I want. And
right now I want a piece of cake.

390
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:40,615
From now on, when I'm hungry, I am
going to eat whatever I am hungry for.

391
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:43,350
That is
a dangerous game, friend-o.

392
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:45,022
Well, because
I thought that it was

393
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:46,651
a book about Anthropologie,
the store.

394
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,628
I don't know why you were in
that part of the bookstore.

395
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:50,186
Because it's next to
the baby section, okay?

396
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:52,665
Well, that makes more sense. You
should have said that at the beginning,

397
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,395
when you said, "I read a
book about anthropology."

398
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:56,300
I don't even know why
you're screaming at me right now.

399
00:15:56,371 --> 00:15:57,633
I'm not screaming.
I'm not screaming.

400
00:15:58,072 --> 00:15:59,937
That's Meredith's cake.
It's her birthday.

401
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:01,532
I don't care.

402
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:04,009
I have an appetite for life.

403
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,974
Mmm.

404
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:10,081
God, that's lemon.

405
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:14,782
Good for you, man.
Good for you.

406
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:20,694
He takes what he wants.

407
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,521
You know what?

408
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:27,329
I think you're attractive
and I want to sleep with you.

409
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:28,660
What about Kelly?

410
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,568
You read my mind.

411
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,199
Is this a joke?

412
00:16:32,874 --> 00:16:34,136
Yep.

413
00:16:36,644 --> 00:16:37,975
It's hard to
live that way, man.

414
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:40,810
You gotta really not care what
people think about you, right?

415
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,183
I don't know how you do it,
Michael. I can't be that cold.

416
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,115
You'll learn, baby,
you'll learn.

417
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:56,955
I am an honorable man
and I will honor the contract.

418
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:59,262
But I don't have to
give her the good stuff.

419
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:03,102
Schrute sperm are strong, but they're
no match for a grown Schrute man.

420
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:06,670
Let's see what she gets.

421
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,572
Boss, we're out of paper.

422
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:14,706
Yeah, I noticed that.

423
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:16,682
Aren't you gonna add any more? Nope.

424
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:19,381
He don't give
an F about nothing.

425
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,882
I have got big balls.

426
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:24,647
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

427
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,455
What about an
energy drink or something?

428
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:30,195
It gets in the breast milk. If I drink
it, Cece drinks it six hours later.

429
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:31,626
Well, it doesn't mean
I can't drink it.

430
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:33,064
Well, it does and it doesn't.

431
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:36,332
I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

432
00:17:36,404 --> 00:17:40,101
but a lot guys in the
warehouse work multiple jobs,

433
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:41,232
so we have a place.

434
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:42,832
A place?

435
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,036
A restful location.

436
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,613
Talk to Glen, he'll
take you up in the lift.

437
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,482
You sleep in the warehouse?

438
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,113
Light bulb's burned out,
so it's dark.

439
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,048
And the heat from the backup
generator keeps it nice and warm.

440
00:17:56,557 --> 00:17:59,492
Sometimes I think about it when
I'm trying to fall asleep at home.

441
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:04,019
But as far as the rest of the
office goes, it doesn't exist. Okay?

442
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:05,360
Okay.
Pam?

443
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,793
Okay.

444
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:09,460
For your signature.

445
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:10,561
Okay.

446
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:17,466
Phyllis?

447
00:18:19,547 --> 00:18:20,639
Okay, look at me.

448
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:26,818
Phyllis, look at...
Okay, that's...

449
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:31,149
All right, all right, you
know what? I'm sick of this.

450
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:34,126
I'm sick of the little
disapproving head shakes.

451
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:36,686
If you think that's going
to have any effect on me,

452
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:37,890
it will not.

453
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:41,867
I am going to leave right now
and go to a motel to meet Donna.

454
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,532
Why not your condo?

455
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:47,400
Because a motel is dirty,
and it is sexy.

456
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:50,106
Like me and like Donna.

457
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:53,705
And frankly, the stuff that we're
into isn't very condo-appropriate.

458
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:55,476
Michael, will you drop it?

459
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,348
Everybody's spoken their mind
and no one's changing their mind.

460
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:01,181
Okay, Morgan Freeman
narrating everything.

461
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,018
Do you want someone to stop
you? Because no one's going to.

462
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,286
Nobody better try to stop me.

463
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:08,184
Good.

464
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:11,126
I could have stopped him.

465
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,671
Are you warmed up?
No.

466
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:21,866
God, Angela, why is that
always my responsibility?

467
00:19:24,512 --> 00:19:25,706
What did you
do to yourself?

468
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,338
Never mind.
Just... Never mind.

469
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,983
Well, it better
work. DWIGHT: Lt'll work.

470
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,846
Stop kissing me.

471
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,080
It's not in the contract.

472
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,051
How do I feel about
breaking up with Donna?

473
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,557
Good. Moral.
I feel proud.

474
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,260
Like a grown-up.

475
00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:25,064
That was not easy because
I really liked her a lot.

476
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,335
I'm a little bit
emotional right now

477
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:32,004
because I know that I absolutely
made the right decision.

478
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:35,281
At the end of the day,
we have to do what's right.

479
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,843
And it was either
living with myself

480
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,588
or being happy.

481
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:46,292
And I picked

482
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:48,117
the

483
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,220
former.

484
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,167
Michael Scott?
Yes?

485
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,500
Do you want to make
a comment on the rumors?

486
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:00,836
Um...

487
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,235
I have done some
very bad things.

488
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:06,912
Things of which
I'm not proud.

489
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:10,777
I would like to
publicly apologize

490
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,277
to the coach
and the players,

491
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:16,583
and I vow to never

492
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:21,254
listen to my bodily
instincts ever again.

493
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:24,828
I'm talking about the Sabre
printers that catch on fire.

494
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:29,560
Oh! Okay, I was talking
about... What's going on?
