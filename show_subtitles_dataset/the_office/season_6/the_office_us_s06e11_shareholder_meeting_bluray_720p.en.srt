1
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:07,645
Not again.

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,344
Bow down
before Recyclops.

3
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:12,114
Five years ago corporate
said we had to start

4
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:13,711
a recycling program
for Earth Day,

5
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,256
so Dwight took
the lead on that,

6
00:00:15,324 --> 00:00:19,317
and introduced us to a very close
friend of his named Recyclops.

7
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:22,490
Happy Earth Day, everyone.
I'm Recyclops.

8
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,963
Did you know that
an old milk carton

9
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,297
can be sawed in half
and used as a planter?

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,496
The next year, he
really stepped things up.

11
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:34,609
Who has put a number seven
plastic in a number four bin?

12
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:38,203
A year after that, Recyclops
really began to take shape.

13
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:44,750
Recyclops will drown you
in your over-watered lawns!

14
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:48,479
Then tragedy struck Recyclops
when his fictional planet

15
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:51,788
was attacked by some other
fictitious thing, I can't remember.

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,387
Recyclops will have
his revenge!

17
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,891
I think this was also the year
that he renounced Earth Day

18
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:01,094
and vowed to destroy
the planet he once loved.

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,536
Oh, my God, you guys,
look! It's Recyclops!

20
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,369
Recyclops destroy!

21
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,973
Oh, is today Recyclops Day? Yes.

22
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:15,039
I thought you were killed
by Polluticon or something.

23
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,846
Polluticon wishes.

24
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,618
That's aerosol spray. It's
terrible for the environment.

25
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,657
Humans are terrible
for the environment.

26
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:27,725
The thing I like most
about Recyclops

27
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,458
is that he's creating a
different world for our child.

28
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:31,556
Hmm.

29
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,659
A world where you truly
can be anything you want.

30
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:36,101
God bless you,
Recyclops,

31
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:37,934
and your cold
robot heart.

32
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:14,534
Okay. Okay.
How about this?

33
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:16,768
That's great.

34
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,574
I want it to be better
than great, Pam.

35
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:22,105
How about I remain seated and
I just do a little bit of a nod,

36
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,175
sort of a humble thing?
Sure.

37
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:26,517
No. Then my face is down.
They can't see my face.

38
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:27,850
And it looks like
you're taking a dump.

39
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:31,723
Alan Brand who's
the CEO of the company,

40
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:33,590
if title is important
to you,

41
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:37,996
has personally invited
moi to go to New York

42
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,658
to the shareholders'
meeting

43
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:42,203
and sit up on the stage
with the board of directors.

44
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,865
And at some point, they're
going to introduce me

45
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,673
as the most successful
branch manager that they have.

46
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:53,841
And then Michael Scott turns
and waves to the crowd.

47
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,309
And the crowd goes wild.

48
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:59,884
Ladies and gentlemen,
from Scranton, Pennsylvania,

49
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:04,483
please welcome
Michael "The Machine" Scott!

50
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:08,320
Oh.

51
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,989
Don't do the twirl.
Lose the twirl.

52
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,999
Twirl sucks.
Michael, I hated the twirl.

53
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,227
Hate the twirl.

54
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,532
Okay, obviously I'm not
going to do the twirl.

55
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:17,401
I only did it because
I nailed the wave.

56
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:18,962
Yeah, good.
Don't do it.

57
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:23,307
I'm not going
to do the twirl, all right?

58
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:25,141
It's not even a twirl.
It's a spin.

59
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:29,013
I might do the spin.

60
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:32,847
The long-term problem is bad
investments that they need to dump.

61
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,582
And the short-term problem
is the company

62
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:36,317
has no cash and there's
nowhere to get it.

63
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:39,326
Okay, Oscar. I don't need the
whole enchilada, just bullet points.

64
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:40,452
Those are
the bullet points.

65
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,019
Well, could you
condense it, please?

66
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,564
That's as simple
as I can make it.

67
00:03:43,632 --> 00:03:44,894
Michael, the limo's
here for you.

68
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:46,559
It's not a limo,
it's a town car.

69
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:47,966
Town cars are
actually better, though,

70
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,765
better torque,
better handling.

71
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,135
He said limousine, so...

72
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:54,232
Check it out, guys,
there's a limo down here.

73
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,339
Michael, look.

74
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:06,820
Oh, man!
It's a limo.

75
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:07,946
They sent a limo.

76
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,390
Town cars suck.
A town car

77
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,484
is something that a company
sends when they're in trouble.

78
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:15,894
A limousine is something
that a company sends

79
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,990
when they have cause
for celebration.

80
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:22,595
And in this case, I think
we are celebrating me.

81
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:29,310
Move it! Quick!

82
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:31,608
Wow! Wow!

83
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,648
Oh, no way!
Yeah!

84
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:38,216
What kind of mileage
does this baby get?

85
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:41,154
It's like what high school
kids take to prom on TV shows.

86
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:43,885
So typical of management
to spend money on this.

87
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,893
Bunch of boobs!

88
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:48,429
Hate to break it to you, Oscar,
but some of us like boobs.

89
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,294
Calves.
Calves all the way.

90
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:51,662
I'm so jealous
right now.

91
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,497
Hey, you know who you
should be jealous of?

92
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,934
Yourself.

93
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,871
Because you're invited,
and you're invited,

94
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,965
and you're invited,
and you, and you,

95
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:02,533
and you and you and you
and you... Car seats eight.

96
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:03,908
What?
The car seats eight.

97
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,276
The limo seats eight.

98
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,111
Okay, then Jim and Pam
and Ryan plus a guest.

99
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,172
No.
No, thanks.

100
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,878
I'll use it
when you're done.

101
00:05:11,053 --> 00:05:12,987
Mmm.

102
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:16,154
Whoa.

103
00:05:16,591 --> 00:05:19,355
The Dunder Mifflin
stock symbol is DMI.

104
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,952
Do you know what
that stands for?

105
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,826
Dummies,
Morons and Idiots,

106
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:25,526
because that's what
you'd have to be to own it.

107
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:29,430
And as one of those idiots, I
believe the board owes me answers.

108
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,264
I wish the
windows weren't tinted

109
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,331
so people could
see us in here.

110
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:36,241
Hey, guys, do you think anyone
might have had sex in here?

111
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:38,142
Definitely. Definitely. Smells like it.

112
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,737
Look, they got pillows.

113
00:05:39,815 --> 00:05:42,010
That, that's bigger
than my bed.

114
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,314
Word.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:46,816
Who's playing
with the button?

116
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:50,520
Hey, Ryan, could you start consolidating

117
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:52,287
all our Rolodex
information into Outlook?

118
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:54,090
Doesn't seem like
there's much of a point

119
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,322
if the company's
going under.

120
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,523
But if the company
doesn't go under,

121
00:05:56,598 --> 00:05:58,259
then we'll finally have all
our contacts in one program.

122
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,301
Company's probably going under,
though. It could go either way.

123
00:06:00,369 --> 00:06:01,495
Seems like it's
leaning one way.

124
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,901
Maybe we should just
wait and find out.

125
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:03,995
Definitely.
Okay.

126
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,905
So should we wait to find out
before we start doing all this stuff?

127
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:09,170
Nah. Might as well
do it now.

128
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:15,782
Michael, what if somebody asks
you a question at this meeting?

129
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:16,977
Are you just
going to wave or what?

130
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,417
I will have to answer.

131
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:19,511
I'll ask you
a question.

132
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,714
Make it a softball.

133
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,280
Something he can, like,
crank out of the park.

134
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,452
Michael Scott, you run the most
profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin.

135
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:27,722
Yeah.
How do you do it?

136
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:31,493
No, no, that's too hard.
Say, your name is Zamboni,

137
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:34,700
and then I will say, "Well,
we're sort of on thin ice."

138
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,828
Uh-oh!

139
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:37,337
I won't say that. I'll
say something like that.

140
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,001
This is your big day. Come on.

141
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:42,475
Whoo. Oh, my God. This is it.

142
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:44,672
Mr. Scott?
Yes.

143
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,008
I'm Laurie.
Oh, hi.

144
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,514
Thank you for joining us. Come with me.

145
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:49,743
Well, thank you.
And please call...

146
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:51,786
Continue to call me
Mr. Scott.

147
00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:52,877
Okay.

148
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,785
If you just want to follow me
I'll take you up to the lounge.

149
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:57,723
Well, I guess this is as far
as I can take you guys, so...

150
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,522
Good luck,
Michael. See you later.

151
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,928
Officers. Thank you.

152
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:05,023
After you, Mr. Scott.

153
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,397
Thank you.

154
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:08,126
Michael.
Hello.

155
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:09,397
So glad you could make it. Thank you.

156
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:10,495
How was the ride?

157
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:13,564
Oh. It was awesome.
Very, very sublime.

158
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,701
I'm glad. I want to
introduce you to everyone.

159
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,711
Okay. First we'll start with Alan Brand.

160
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,178
Alan, CEO.

161
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,442
Michael Scott,
Branch Manager, Scranton.

162
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,479
It's nice to meet you,
Michael. Nice to meet you, too.

163
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:25,884
It's an honor
and a privilege.

164
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:29,048
Seated, we have the former
congressman, Chris O'Keefe.

165
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:30,182
Your eminence.

166
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:33,861
For those of you with
questions, please line up

167
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:35,191
behind one of
the four microphones

168
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:36,491
that have been placed
in the aisles.

169
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,157
Coming through!

170
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:56,514
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

171
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:59,052
Damn it!

172
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:03,056
What... Okay.

173
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:07,918
I was hoping to lob Michael
a softball question early.

174
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,964
I wanted to swing by
the Garment District,

175
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,329
pick up a few crates
of my shirts.

176
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,924
I got a shirt guy.

177
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,832
Would you
believe this?

178
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:19,635
The money they spent
on this convention hall!

179
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,970
Excuse me, miss.

180
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,875
Just want to take this stupid
board of directors by their necks.

181
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:25,572
This is so simple.

182
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:26,807
Yeah.
Idiots!

183
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,782
Well, you should do that.
Get in line.

184
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,047
Oh, what a great idea, and
lose my job. No, thank you.

185
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:37,254
Look, do you want to be
able to tell your grandkids

186
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:38,622
you stood up
for yourself

187
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:41,628
during America's
biggest financial crisis?

188
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:45,232
How is he going
to have grandkids?

189
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,260
You guys ever
protect the President?

190
00:08:48,336 --> 00:08:49,496
No.

191
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:54,171
What about Madonna or
Obama twins? Anybody famous?

192
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,039
Not supposed to
talk about it.

193
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:57,237
Nelly Furtado.

194
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:58,506
All right, guys.

195
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:00,942
Are you ready?

196
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,449
Rock and roll.

197
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:25,671
Dunder Mifflin is
still a strong company,

198
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,004
and we are poised
to come through this

199
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:31,375
more streamlined and
profitable than ever.

200
00:09:33,682 --> 00:09:35,877
This is not as much fun
as I thought it would be.

201
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,181
It was fun when we weren't
on the brink of bankruptcy.

202
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:39,686
We're going
bankrupt, you think?

203
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:44,483
They are really angry.

204
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:47,826
The shareholders need to
empower our leadership...

205
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:49,158
I'm just going to
run to the bathroom.

206
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,561
Will you save my place?
Sure.

207
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,190
No. He will not.

208
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:53,359
Excuse me?

209
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:56,529
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in
a household with no consequences?

210
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:57,663
Lt'll just be a second.

211
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:58,763
Oh.

212
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,365
If onlys and justs
were candies and nuts

213
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:03,934
then every day
would be Erntedankfest.

214
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,675
and we're confident
there are many things

215
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:10,547
to be optimistic about
in Dunder Mifflin's future.

216
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:13,381
And one of them is
here with us today.

217
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:17,684
Michael Scott,
Scranton Branch Manager.

218
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:18,984
Yes!

219
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,152
In these
uncertain times,

220
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:23,061
Michael has managed to
maintain steady profits

221
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:27,192
from his Scranton branch.
We all thank you, Michael.

222
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,829
Another bright spot in the
Dunder Mifflin landscape,

223
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:35,842
our new waste pulp
repurposing plant in Milford.

224
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,975
Hey, Phyllis, are you just
getting back from lunch now?

225
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,041
Mmm. Bob took me
to Capello's.

226
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:45,677
We got a little tipsy.

227
00:10:45,754 --> 00:10:46,778
Okay.

228
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,550
Shouldn't be
telling me that stuff,

229
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:51,319
and also shouldn't be taking
two-hour lunches without telling me.

230
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:54,260
Oh, it's okay. Michael doesn't
really care about these things.

231
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:58,129
I care about them. And I'm just
as much of a boss as Michael.

232
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:01,799
What's so funny?
I'm a co-manager.

233
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,269
That doesn't
make you a boss.

234
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:05,533
It's not like you can
fire people or anything.

235
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,142
Who... How did you...
Who told you this?

236
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,007
We can't say.
Ryan.

237
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,637
Sorry. I'm plastered.

238
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,682
Okay, who else
has heard the rumor

239
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:17,547
that I am not as much
in charge as Michael?

240
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,986
Stuff gets around.
I don't participate.

241
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:27,320
Who here heard it
from Ryan?

242
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:29,122
Does an e-mail count?

243
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:30,255
Yes.

244
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,855
Then, yeah.

245
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:33,958
I am just as much
of a boss as Michael,

246
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,265
and I can do anything
that Michael can do.

247
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:37,702
All right?

248
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:40,400
Who here believes that I
have as much power as Michael?

249
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:49,143
I forgot I have to support
him, no matter what.

250
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:50,548
Close one.

251
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:52,252
These questions
are bush league.

252
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,618
You should get up
and say something.

253
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,919
You got to be true
to what's in there.

254
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,184
Don't be a wuss.

255
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,820
I've always been the guy who
can rally other people to rebel.

256
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:04,888
In high school I organized a
walkout over standardized testing.

257
00:12:04,966 --> 00:12:08,231
Got over 500 students
to just skip the SATs.

258
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:10,032
At the last second, I
chickened out, took it anyway.

259
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,938
Got a 1220.
Always regretted it.

260
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,336
I feel lachrymose.

261
00:12:17,846 --> 00:12:20,007
Believe me, everyone
is working very hard,

262
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:23,312
working weekends, struggling,
trying to right the ship.

263
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:24,510
You're criminals!

264
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:28,454
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry.
These are not criminals.

265
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:32,359
They're nice. They invited
me to come here today.

266
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:35,154
They invited me to
their hospitality suite,

267
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,097
where I had free food
and it was delicious.

268
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,324
Get this, you know
how nice they are?

269
00:12:40,401 --> 00:12:42,028
They sent
a stretch limo

270
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:44,230
all the way to pick me up in Scranton.

271
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,466
Limousine?
Yes.

272
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,008
You're all corrupt!
You should be in jail!

273
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:53,170
Quiet! Quiet, please!
Please, quiet!

274
00:12:53,848 --> 00:12:57,807
Quiet, please! We want
to hear your questions.

275
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:02,219
Do you love her, or do
you love the idea of her?

276
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,622
I don't know, man.
I just don't know.

277
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:07,718
I've got to make an example out
of him. Should I just fire him?

278
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:09,491
Can you actually
fire people?

279
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:10,826
To be honest,
I don't know.

280
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,390
But maybe I could just yell
at him in front of people.

281
00:13:13,468 --> 00:13:15,698
Well, I can't really imagine
you yelling at anyone.

282
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,704
Oh, I yell.
You've heard me yell.

283
00:13:17,772 --> 00:13:20,036
Okay. I've
heard you exclaim.

284
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:23,475
Like the time you said, "Hey,
look, we parked over here!"

285
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:24,569
Well, that was
apple-picking day.

286
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:25,806
There was no need
to yell that day.

287
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,007
You know, I was just
excited to find the car.

288
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:30,277
Perfect end
to a perfect day.

289
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,114
Well, you'll
figure it out.

290
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,891
Okay, we're going to take
a 15-minute break,

291
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,894
and then we're going to
answer more questions.

292
00:13:40,962 --> 00:13:42,122
You haven't said
anything yet

293
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,664
and we're headed
for bankruptcy!

294
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,288
Yeah!
Yeah!

295
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,028
Yeah, well, that's not going to
happen. That's not going to happen.

296
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:49,694
We'll be back
with some answers.

297
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:51,966
- What?
- What answers?

298
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,100
Okay, I know that
you're mad at me

299
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:56,234
and you're mad
at all of them...

300
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:58,142
How are you going to
fix the company?

301
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,113
Okay. All right.

302
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,248
All right.

303
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:06,549
We are going to go out
there during this break

304
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:09,454
and we're going to
come back with a plan.

305
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:11,418
We're going to come back
with a plan for you.

306
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:13,483
It's a 45-day plan.

307
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:16,687
Forty-five days to
get us back on track.

308
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,957
Forty-five points.

309
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:23,627
It's a 45-day, 45-point,
one point per day,

310
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,866
we get to 45 points,
we're back in business!

311
00:14:28,476 --> 00:14:30,910
And you can take
that to the bank!

312
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:32,836
And, limo lady,

313
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:36,113
we are going completely
carbon-neutral!

314
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,887
I love you, New York!

315
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:02,669
You! You!

316
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,679
Hey, Ryan,
how's it going?

317
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,413
Here's the thing.

318
00:15:07,482 --> 00:15:10,451
I've tried it, like, five
different ways in my head and...

319
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:14,147
Oh. Got one.
I'm such a perfectionist

320
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:17,888
that I'd kind of rather not do it
at all than do a crappy version.

321
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,450
Simple data entry, though. So
there's really only one way to do it.

322
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,462
Sounds like you have a
really specific vision for it.

323
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,963
Do you want to maybe
just take a whack at it?

324
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:25,260
You know what?
What?

325
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,595
I think I know the problem. Great.

326
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:27,794
I think
you seem distracted.

327
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:29,200
Yep, that is
the problem.

328
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,567
And you know what, I
came up with something

329
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,969
that I think is
really gonna help.

330
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,632
Well, I'm glad you're
finally being proactive, Jim.

331
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,868
I am, too.
Let me show you.

332
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:40,580
Wow, things are
really picking up.

333
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,945
What was that about?

334
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:43,074
What?

335
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:44,743
You were supposed to wave.

336
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,684
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.

337
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:48,119
What are we supposed
to tell them now?

338
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,520
Okay, you've dug us
quite a hole.

339
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,990
We tell them the plan.
Right?

340
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,459
There is no plan.

341
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,427
Here's what
we're going to do.

342
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,366
The 45-day thing that I
outlined, we go with that.

343
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,935
Day 45, company saved.

344
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,097
Day 44, go,
what have we got?

345
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,197
We have 15 minutes.

346
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:07,434
Excuse me?

347
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,635
Just whatever comes
to mind, shout it out.

348
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,871
Who the hell
is this guy?

349
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:14,278
I am the guy
who roused that crowd.

350
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,509
Yes.
Got them on their feet.

351
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,574
They were so happy down there. Yes. Yes.

352
00:16:17,652 --> 00:16:19,051
Who cares?

353
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:23,153
Okay. All right.

354
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,454
Well, I know a guy, this
Mexican guy, he's a math wiz.

355
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,029
He knows economics as well
as he knows bullfighting.

356
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:34,330
And I am going to
call in a little favor.

357
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:35,926
No, no, no.
Don't call anybody, Michael.

358
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:37,301
Well, I'm texting him, so.

359
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,398
Please do not text
anybody now, Michael.

360
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,241
It's done.

361
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:49,640
Oh.

362
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,584
There he is. Come on in, come on in.

363
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,416
Gentlemen, I would
like you to meet Oscar.

364
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:55,888
Come on in,
don't be shy.

365
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:57,982
This is Oscar Martinez.

366
00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:00,820
Oscar, why don't you come
over here? Let me present you.

367
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,453
Step up,
step up there.

368
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,796
Oscar is an accountant
extraordinaire at the Scranton branch,

369
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,096
and he has
a wonderful idea

370
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,036
as to how to get us out of
this murky, murky situation.

371
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:12,197
Take it away.

372
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,972
I think this is
really going to help.

373
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:21,015
If you could just
hold up here one second.

374
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,515
Hey, guys, just
a quick announcement.

375
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,073
If I could have
everyone's attention.

376
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:26,950
Just figured you needed a place
where you could concentrate.

377
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:29,182
And not be bothered
by bothering people.

378
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,281
Okay.

379
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:31,950
Let me show you
what I mean.

380
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:35,325
Your new office.
How great is that, right?

381
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,489
For a job well done.
Well, not done.

382
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:40,729
I will do my work
right now.

383
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:42,201
I will stay late tonight. Right.

384
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,738
I'm very sorry about
everything.

385
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:45,932
You're a good kid.
You know what,

386
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:47,440
it gets bigger
once you're in there.

387
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:48,805
Enjoy it.

388
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:54,342
Is there Internet?

389
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,251
Tell them what you
told me. This is genius.

390
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,252
Tell them about
the cash flow

391
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,764
and the dumping of
properties and...

392
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:16,697
This is all good.
It's all good stuff.

393
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,137
Lay it on them.

394
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:22,108
I feel,
as does Mr. Scott,

395
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:23,973
that we are in
the best of hands,

396
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:25,677
capable hands.

397
00:18:25,746 --> 00:18:28,476
That wasn't what
you were saying to me.

398
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,481
He was much more
articulate

399
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:33,543
and that was better,
much better.

400
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:36,146
I think this has gone
very well and I thank you.

401
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:37,384
Okay.

402
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:39,950
Oh.

403
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:43,394
Hey, hey.
What were you doing?

404
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:45,091
Michael, I didn't ask
to come up here.

405
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,929
Wow, man!
What?

406
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,468
That was embarrassing.

407
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:49,901
For me.
For me, too.

408
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:52,235
For you and me?
You embarrassed me.

409
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:57,672
Well...

410
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,240
That was a waste
of a text.

411
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:03,647
Let's get down
to brass tacks.

412
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:05,709
I think that we
might be in trouble.

413
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:07,219
We don't seem
to have a plan,

414
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,381
so I'm thinking
I go down there,

415
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:12,824
maybe rattle off a few jokes,
congressman can follow.

416
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,925
He's our best manager? Where's
the off button on this moron?

417
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:20,126
I'm not a moron.

418
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:25,262
Time after time, my
branch leads in sales.

419
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:30,139
I have personally won over 17
Dundie Awards, so I am not a moron.

420
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:34,773
And I'm just trying to help,
you know? So, you're the moron.

421
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:43,223
Yes, it is a thrill
to be honored by one's company.

422
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,351
To have the people that you
work for stop for a minute

423
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:49,396
and say, "Wow, great job!"
That's what it's about.

424
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:52,398
He can take the bus.
He's had his limo ride.

425
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,162
That is what
it is all about.

426
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,932
Not the perks.
The perks...

427
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,166
The perks, I could
take or leave the perks.

428
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,368
Oscar, Oscar!
Come on!

429
00:20:02,443 --> 00:20:05,241
But limos are for people
who make the company money,

430
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:06,905
not lose millions
and have no plan.

431
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:08,039
There he is,
there he is!

432
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,582
So we're leaving early.

433
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:12,652
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

434
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,052
Michael!
Oh, yeah!

435
00:20:17,225 --> 00:20:20,661
After all, we are the only
ones with anything to celebrate.

436
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:24,425
Scranton! Scranton!
Scranton! Scranton!

437
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,365
Dunder Mifflin!

438
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,734
The gentleman
in the glasses.

439
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,102
Dwight Schrute,
Scranton Branch.

440
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:40,204
I just want to say that I have
been standing in this line all day.

441
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,106
And if this line
is any indication

442
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:44,913
of how this company
is being run,

443
00:20:44,986 --> 00:20:46,954
then we are
in big trouble.

444
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,720
Thank you.
Right, I know.

445
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:59,526
And I just
want to say that

446
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,660
I believe that there
are options out there.

447
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:05,831
A take-a-number option,
like they have in a deli.

448
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,166
What about
line varieties?

449
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:13,304
Like an express line for quick
comments of 10 words or less.

450
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:16,009
That could move
much more efficiently.

451
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:21,282
What about ropes along the
lines that you can hold on to?

452
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:22,686
Thank you.

453
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,257
Thank you for
your suggestions.

454
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,486
Yes.
