1
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:04,828
Vancouver Court
Hotel, how may I help you?

2
00:00:04,897 --> 00:00:06,990
Hello, Vancouver,
this is Michael Scott

3
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:09,500
calling from
the United States of America.

4
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:11,661
I have a reservation
in your fair city

5
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:14,205
from February 12th
to the 19th.

6
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:15,805
First week of the Olympics.

7
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:17,239
Well, we're looking forward
to having you,

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,901
so let me just pull up
your information here.

9
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,002
Oki-doke.

10
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:21,774
Uh, I don't seem
to have it, sir.

11
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:23,205
What?

12
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:24,613
I'm not seeing anything
under confirmation...

13
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:26,742
No. No. Could it be under "affirmation?"

14
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:27,843
'Cause you have
thousands of those.

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,751
We're just trying to
look it up right now.

16
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,983
You did get the
e-vite to my barbeque.

17
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,490
Come on, Dwight.
Michael.

18
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:36,585
Sir, a lot of people are
trying to get last-minute reservations

19
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,186
at hotels here
for the Olympics,

20
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:39,753
but we've been
fully booked for months.

21
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,632
Well, I have been booked for three
years, so you should have that.

22
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:46,193
I have always heard that British
Columbia is a very nice place,

23
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:48,899
but I'm not getting that
from this conversation.

24
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:53,274
Wait, I got it! Confirmation
code, X-V-2-R-D-M.

25
00:00:54,546 --> 00:00:55,604
Oh.

26
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:57,148
Here it is. Yeah.
Oh.

27
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,274
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,648
Seven nights in our
street-view economy single.

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,879
That's it.
Yeah.

30
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:05,048
We changed systems a
while back. I do apologize.

31
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:06,283
Okay.
Okay.

32
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,757
How may I
help you, Mr. Scott?

33
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:11,159
All right. I would like to
cancel my reservation, please.

34
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,095
There is a cancellation fee
for this, sir.

35
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:15,258
Okay, put it on my card.

36
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:38,449
Today, Jo Bennett,
the CEO from Sabre

37
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:41,220
is coming to see us
here for the first time.

38
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:45,093
She bought us sight unseen,
like a mail-order bride,

39
00:01:45,264 --> 00:01:48,392
so she's gotta be kind
of nervous. I mean, are we ugly?

40
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:51,300
Are we smart? Are we cool?
Are we too cool?

41
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,366
Do we speak English?

42
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,268
Why, hello!

43
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:01,539
This is
Michael Scott,

44
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:03,171
co-regional manager
of this branch.

45
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,442
Pleasure to meet you,
Miss Bennett.

46
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,108
Uh, that's Mrs. Bennett,
sweetheart.

47
00:02:06,185 --> 00:02:08,483
My husband and I are divorced
but I kept the "missus"

48
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:10,818
just to piss off the new wife. Oh.

49
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,948
Well, let's
take a gander around this place.

50
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:14,617
These sure are
pretty dogs.

51
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:16,456
They love a good crotch.

52
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:17,990
They sure do.

53
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:19,553
You should take that
as a compliment.

54
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:21,030
Oh, I do.

55
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,125
Hello.
Hello.

56
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:27,996
Do you always stay seated
when a lady enters the room?

57
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:29,404
I am treating you
the same as a man,

58
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,204
for whom I would
also not stand.

59
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,177
Unless it was the
president, or Judge Judy.

60
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:36,741
I like that.

61
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:38,646
- This is Accounting.
- Uh-huh.

62
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:39,741
Hi.

63
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:40,910
Good-looking group.

64
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,352
Over here is Meredith
Palmer, Creed Bratton.

65
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:44,980
Another couple
of heartbreakers.

66
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:46,547
Who's this tall
drink of sun tea?

67
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,117
That is Jim Halpert. He is the
co-regional manager of this office.

68
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:51,719
I thought this guy
was the manager.

69
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,698
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager.
That's the other co-manager.

70
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,358
Two guys doing one job?

71
00:02:57,669 --> 00:02:59,432
We gotta do something
about that.

72
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:03,832
I've got some
Valentine's cards

73
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:06,673
for my co-workers
and my bro-workers.

74
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:08,212
No. No.

75
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,474
What? No candy?

76
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,577
Valentine's Day.
Right around the corner.

77
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,517
Erin and I have been
on zero dates.

78
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:16,417
So I got her a
Valentine's Day card,

79
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,615
but I didn't want
to seem too eager,

80
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,681
so I got cards for
everyone in the whole office

81
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,727
to kind of dilute
it a little bit.

82
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:24,887
Look alive.

83
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:27,124
Jeez, you gave me
a paper cut on my throat.

84
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,231
Yeah, I have this thing
about men cutting

85
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:31,235
or threatening
to cut my throat.

86
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,168
Don't try to
cut my throat.

87
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:36,730
Jo, I don't know how things work in
Florida, which from your description

88
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:39,868
sounds like a colorful,
lawless swamp,

89
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:43,912
but here it takes
two men to do one job,

90
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:46,010
where in Florida,
it might take

91
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,245
one very strong
woman to do such a job.

92
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,685
Whoa. Whoa.

93
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:53,220
I'll take over. Um,
what we're doing here,

94
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:55,624
Michael handles more of
the big picture stuff,

95
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,094
and I handle more of
the day-to-day stuff.

96
00:03:58,163 --> 00:03:59,460
Yeah.
- So, together...

97
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,226
I think I understand.
All right.

98
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,291
Each of you is
doing half a job.

99
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,960
No. And sometimes
I can hardly handle that.

100
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:09,139
Now this is knucklehead talk. I'm
not going to abide it, you know.

101
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,666
You can't give me gravy and tell me
it's jelly, 'cause gravy ain't sweet.

102
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,439
Is it, Jim? I don't think so.

103
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:15,605
Michael?

104
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:16,739
Forget the question.

105
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:19,214
I think one of you
should return to Sales,

106
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:21,309
and the other one
will be a manager.

107
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,412
I humbly accept
the management position.

108
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:25,581
Why would you just
automatically get it?

109
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:29,650
Because, well, Jim, where I'm
from, there are two types of folk,

110
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,528
those who ain't and those who
are knee-high on a grasshopper.

111
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:37,433
Which type ain't you ain't?
Y'all come back now.

112
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,204
Do you even know what that means? Yes.

113
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:43,434
Well, I'm gonna let this
marinate. So you can go.

114
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:44,566
Um...

115
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:46,406
You can go on.
Yeah.

116
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:52,249
I'm Jolene Bennett, Jo for short.
I'm a breast cancer survivor,

117
00:04:52,317 --> 00:04:54,444
close personal friends
with Nancy Pelosi,

118
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:57,147
and Truman Capote and I slept
with three of the same guys.

119
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,849
When I was a little girl,
I was terrified to fly,

120
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,893
and now I have my
own pilot's license.

121
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,894
I am CEO of
Sabre International

122
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:07,659
and I sell the best damn printers and
all-in-one machines Korea can make.

123
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:08,757
Pleased to meet you.

124
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,127
Traffic jam.

125
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,170
Uh-oh. Traffic jam
on route three.

126
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,232
Twenty people
dead in a pileup.

127
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,298
There's blood everywhere.

128
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:20,143
Um, I got you
a Valentine's card.

129
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:21,736
You did?
Yeah.

130
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,638
A bird and a dog!

131
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:26,479
Yeah, well, it's Snoopy and Woodstock.

132
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,609
You named them?

133
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:29,085
Uh, Charles Schulz did.

134
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:30,877
I thought it was relevant

135
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,049
'cause I got you all those
birds for Christmas, remember?

136
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,822
Yeah, I do remember.
Oh, they love each other.

137
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,295
Oh, look at that. They
sure do. I hadn't noticed.

138
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:41,627
Oh, it smells
really good, too.

139
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,065
Yeah, it's
Roger Federer for Men.

140
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,625
I sprayed
some in there.

141
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:47,570
Andy, whoa!
Thank you very much.

142
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,436
It's got pheromones
in it.

143
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,073
- Hey.
- Hi.

144
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,040
Just choosing seats, not getting
married. Chop, chop, little onion.

145
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:58,045
Jo, there's books
in my chair.

146
00:05:58,116 --> 00:05:59,481
That's right, darling.

147
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:02,782
Now you're the proud new
owner of a Sabre handbook,

148
00:06:02,854 --> 00:06:04,685
and my autobiography.

149
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,191
Now, you all must be in a tizzy.
I can see it on your faces.

150
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,525
I mean, what's going on now? I
mean, who owns Dunder Mifflin?

151
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:14,429
Right? I mean, Sabre?
What's that?

152
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:18,892
Some company we never heard
of from down in Tallahassee?

153
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,598
I mean, where is that?
Near Mars?

154
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,470
No, we know. Texas.

155
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:26,400
Now, Dunder Mifflin
has an arm's reach

156
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,072
into all these small businesses
all over the northeast,

157
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,647
and now we're gonna
take that arm

158
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:36,351
and we're going to
start selling printers.

159
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:37,854
I could manage my
way around that.

160
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:39,754
They're the easiest-to-use
printers in the market.

161
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:42,316
I will try to
manage my excitement.

162
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:46,425
I have been saying
the word "manager" a lot,

163
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:49,592
so whenever Jo thinks
manager, she thinks of me.

164
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,171
Camel cigarettes did the
same thing with Joe Camel

165
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,138
by making him
look like a penis.

166
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,971
I can't even go
near a cigarette now

167
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,534
without thinking of
a penis, and vice versa.

168
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,306
I think that's it.
So we're all good.

169
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,179
Okay.
Thanks, y'all.

170
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:14,723
Oh, my God.

171
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,923
I guess Andy likes me. I never
thought of him in that way.

172
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,928
But I guess in most
romantic comedies,

173
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,489
the guy you're supposed
to be with is the one

174
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,262
that you never
thought of in that way.

175
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:28,136
You might have even thought he was
annoying or possibly homosexual.

176
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,806
So check this out.

177
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:32,309
According to the handbook,
you could make more money

178
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:33,969
as a salesman
than as a manager.

179
00:07:34,045 --> 00:07:36,104
They have all these
incentive programs.

180
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,739
I ran your numbers
from last year.

181
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:39,647
This is way more
than I make now.

182
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:41,879
I don't think I'm gonna
miss being manager.

183
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:43,750
You know how some people say
they're not in it for the money?

184
00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:45,687
Well, with all due
respect to this job,

185
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,918
I think I'm definitely
in it for the money.

186
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:49,858
And, quite honestly,
the women.

187
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,261
Hey. Got a second?

188
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,422
Sure.
All right.

189
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:56,296
You here to tell me that you
think I would be a better manager,

190
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,893
and that you are sorry
for being such a jerk?

191
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,494
Actually, yeah.

192
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,504
What?
Exactly that.

193
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:07,978
I think that you absolutely deserve
the manager position more than I do.

194
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,548
What? Really?
Yeah.

195
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,184
Wow! Wow!

196
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,751
Hello, Oscar.

197
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:19,017
Michael, reading.

198
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,114
What are you reading?

199
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:21,216
The Atlantic.

200
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,488
Oh, that is my favorite
ocean. I love it.

201
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:27,623
I'm so happy right now. No, I
can't keep it a secret any longer.

202
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:29,230
Jim's stepping
down to salesman.

203
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,565
I am going to be the
sole manager once again.

204
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,604
I should step
into Sales myself.

205
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:36,038
Why? Is there an
untapped gay market?

206
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:38,703
Sabre has no caps
on commissions.

207
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,904
He can make a lot
more money in Sales.

208
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:47,680
Where did you get
that information?

209
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:50,152
Manual.
Manuel who?

210
00:08:50,856 --> 00:08:53,757
Mmm-hmm. Well, according to the manual,

211
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,055
there is no cap
on commissions.

212
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,890
I have been hustled.

213
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:01,429
Son of a bitch.

214
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,365
This is...
Pardon me.

215
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:05,130
Speak of the devil. We
were just talking about you.

216
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:06,636
Have a seat.
Okay.

217
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:09,765
Now, Jim here is thinking
about taking himself

218
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,502
out of the running
for being manager. Yep.

219
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:15,637
Oh, really?
That is so sweet of you!

220
00:09:16,414 --> 00:09:20,282
But I cannot accept, because
I have been thinking about it,

221
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:22,743
and I think I want
to go back to Sales.

222
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:24,049
Really?
- Really?

223
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:25,953
Yeah, you can take the man
out of the salesman,

224
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,219
but you can't take
the sales out of salesman.

225
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:29,988
Well, I think you're both
being a little too modest.

226
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:33,827
No, I really, really think
Michael is better at being manager

227
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,389
for so many reasons.
Mmm-mmm.

228
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:40,598
No. I think I would be bad.
I would sleep in my office...

229
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:42,697
Okay... And I would
sexually harass people.

230
00:09:42,774 --> 00:09:44,674
Why would you do that? I'm
turning myself in right now.

231
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:47,940
You know, Michael, you have more
experience in sales and management,

232
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:49,708
so I'm going to defer
to your judgment.

233
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:50,805
Thank you.

234
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,373
I think you will
become the salesman,

235
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:55,646
and congratulations,

236
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,245
you're gonna be the new
manager of this branch.

237
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,987
That's great.
Congratulations.

238
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,260
Have fun signing my
commission checks, boss.

239
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,867
Michael marked his heights.
He's grown.

240
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,475
Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen,
he's been promoted to sole manager.

241
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:27,215
We have got to step this up. Meet
me behind the dumpster in 90 seconds.

242
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:29,416
Eighty-nine, 88...

243
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,655
You're 20 minutes late.

244
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,158
Um, I was
at another dumpster.

245
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,727
Just admit you lost
track of time.

246
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:41,693
Ryan and I have been meeting up
to work on our diabolical plot against Jim.

247
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,360
Ryan is always late
for our meetings.

248
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,733
I wish I had a lair.

249
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:49,039
Did you see Saw?

250
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,667
Of course I seesaw. Mose
and I seesaw all the time.

251
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:54,541
No, the movie. Did
you see the movie Saw?

252
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:58,610
Oh. Yeah. Great film. Almost
as fun as going on a seesaw.

253
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:01,584
Okay. The reason these movies
are so popular... Mmm-hmm.

254
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:04,416
is the element of
psychological torment.

255
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:07,716
I like where you're
going with this. Continue.

256
00:11:07,926 --> 00:11:10,895
Could we lure him into an
old warehouse or something?

257
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,691
I have an old barn.
It's kind of smelly. Yes.

258
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:14,595
But that might be a
plus. And then what? Okay.

259
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,759
We do what they
did in Saw.

260
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:22,729
I mean, we don't
kill him, obviously.

261
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,796
I have a mask.

262
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:24,933
Okay, that's your idea?

263
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,841
Exactly like in the movie?

264
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:29,744
That is the most idiotic thing
I have ever heard in my life.

265
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,304
Well, suggest something
else then. Don't just...

266
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:32,680
Are you supposed
to cut his leg off?

267
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:34,013
Don't just criticize my idea! Think!

268
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:36,212
You think of
something then.

269
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:41,184
Michael, I'm worried that not all your
toys are gonna fit on your new desk.

270
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,521
How is that possible?

271
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:45,256
Well, in your old office, there were
all those ledges and extra space.

272
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,163
No excuses, Erin, come on.
Make it happen.

273
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,733
You know, I actually think
that I should get back to work.

274
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:53,896
Jim asked me to do some
stuff, and he's manager.

275
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:57,307
Oh, yeah, fine, fine.
Leave it here.

276
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,467
Okay. All right.

277
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,306
I have to make
some sales anyway.

278
00:12:00,378 --> 00:12:03,370
Who should I call with
my magic sales fingers?

279
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,687
Michael Scott,
Head of Sales.

280
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:14,191
You gotta do something, man.
You can't just sit there.

281
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:21,357
The new IT guy. Nick.

282
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,491
Nick.

283
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,536
I think he's the key. He's very
trusting. He's looking for friends.

284
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,798
He's been given an
awesome amount of power,

285
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,635
and does not know
how to wield it.

286
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,970
Like Frodo.

287
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,980
Why don't you just let me handle the
Tolkien references, okay, dumb jock?

288
00:12:36,347 --> 00:12:39,407
Well, I think he can be
corrupted. Like Gollum.

289
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:43,780
Smeagol was corrupted
and became Gollum.

290
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:47,086
I might start a diabolical
plot against him after this one.

291
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:50,089
Who's hungry?

292
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,219
What is that?

293
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,787
It's ants on a log. Michael would
always have me bring them in at 2:30

294
00:12:53,865 --> 00:12:55,765
and say, "Who's hungry?"

295
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:58,166
Oh. I'm fine.
Thank you, though.

296
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,601
Do you want me to spin you in
your chair and make you dizzy?

297
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:01,866
Why would I
want to do that?

298
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,704
It's a thinking technique.
All the top executives do it.

299
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:08,075
It keeps the brain moving, and a
spinning brain's a working brain.

300
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:11,138
For now I'm just gonna
go back to work here.

301
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:12,581
Oh, sure.
Yeah, thank you.

302
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,844
Well...

303
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:19,412
It will be a pleasure doing
business with you. Thanks. Bye, bye.

304
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:26,592
I just got a new account. The
gentlemen's club in Carbondale.

305
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:30,532
It is called Curves. I
went by there the other day,

306
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:34,095
saw some of the women walking
in. Not really my cup of tea.

307
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:36,265
Actually, Kevin,
you might like it.

308
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,399
Nice.

309
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:41,643
You know, we really don't announce
out loud our sales that much.

310
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:43,840
Why not? It's part of
the sales experience.

311
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:46,145
It's not really
1992 anymore.

312
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:47,309
Okay.

313
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:52,215
"You brighten my day with
the sound of your voice.

314
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,487
"You bring so much laughter and
love. You're everything to me,

315
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,994
"and I was so blessed when
God sent you here to me."

316
00:13:58,062 --> 00:13:59,154
Jeez Louise.

317
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,754
I know.
Obsessed with me much?

318
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:01,890
Well, everyone got one.

319
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,695
What did yours say?

320
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,933
"Friends are worth sharing
a dog house with."

321
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:10,566
It's no wonder that Andy gave
Kelly such a romantic card.

322
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,370
I can't
compete with her.

323
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:16,675
That girl can sing and dance and
gets all of her clothes at the mall.

324
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,807
And I feel like such a fool for thinking
that Andy was only going after one girl,

325
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:24,852
because Andy Bernard is a
playboy. And why shouldn't he be?

326
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,182
He's got it all.

327
00:14:30,562 --> 00:14:32,530
There he is.
The IT guy.

328
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:35,231
I see you discovered
the break room.

329
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,324
Yep.

330
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:38,733
I imagine one of the best
things about being an IT guy is,

331
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:41,067
you get to know everyone's
computer passwords.

332
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:42,936
No, I actually don't.

333
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,505
Listen, I know you
have to say that,

334
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:48,273
but we got
a little problem here.

335
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,780
There is an employee
named Jim Halpert,

336
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,612
and he's doing some
terrible things. Okay?

337
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,643
He's molesting people via the
Internet, and we need to stop him.

338
00:14:57,622 --> 00:14:59,214
I think that you
should call the cops.

339
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,588
No, the cops called us.

340
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:07,328
So I'm gonna need you to give me the
password to Jim Halpert's computer.

341
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,965
I don't know what to
tell you, man. I'm sorry.

342
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,591
I just can't give out
his password like that.

343
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:15,401
Nick, we can make things
very difficult for you.

344
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:20,002
Are you threatening me?

345
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:21,136
Threatening you?

346
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:24,272
No.

347
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,088
What is that smell?
Do you smell that?

348
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,396
What is that? Like a
sulfur deposit under here?

349
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,264
Michael, stop.

350
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:46,200
No, I'm serious.
We don't have to put up...

351
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,363
Is it the dogs?
Michael.

352
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:51,805
You know what? We don't
have to deal with this.

353
00:15:51,876 --> 00:15:54,106
I am going to
google sulfur maps.

354
00:15:54,178 --> 00:15:55,509
Michael, it's Phyllis.

355
00:15:57,849 --> 00:15:59,339
No, this is geological.

356
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,215
I sent an email out to
everyone in this area

357
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:04,278
that this might be
a side effect

358
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:06,619
to my new allergy
medication I'm on.

359
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,659
Are you kidding me?
No.

360
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:13,429
And you guys are
okay with this?

361
00:16:13,498 --> 00:16:15,022
She sent an email.

362
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,259
I did.

363
00:16:34,152 --> 00:16:35,642
It's not 'cause
of the smell.

364
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,984
I'm just expecting
a nose bleed.

365
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:41,583
Oh, my God.

366
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,160
You scared me.

367
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:48,789
I'm sorry.
I thought you saw me.

368
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:51,926
I didn't see you. And
you were there all along.

369
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:57,332
Well, warmed it up for you,
so it should be good to go.

370
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,800
Cool. Thanks.
Bye, Andy.

371
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,074
That was weird.

372
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:10,484
No, it ain't. We all saw
the valentine you gave her.

373
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:12,249
I don't even know
what that card said.

374
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,848
Believe me,
if I got that card,

375
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:18,327
we'd be in the bathroom
doing it right now.

376
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:25,294
Hey.

377
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:27,029
Hey.

378
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,739
You know, it's funny. I used to stand
in here and wish I was out there.

379
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:32,537
Now I'm out there,
and I wish I was in here.

380
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,043
Well, the grass
is always greener.

381
00:17:34,112 --> 00:17:36,842
Yeah, except there's
no grass out there.

382
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:39,640
It's just a farty dirt-patch.

383
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:40,843
Well, it's what
you wanted.

384
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:44,615
I really need my job back. We
made a terrible mistake here.

385
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:47,486
For the record, I
fought this. All right?

386
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:49,992
And now, I'm not
really sure what we do.

387
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,522
We make a poster that says,
"Happy Opposite Day"

388
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:56,260
and she sees it on the
way out. That's stupid.

389
00:17:56,334 --> 00:18:00,794
Oh, I wish we had one of those
amnesia flashlights from Men In Black.

390
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:04,836
Hey. What was that movie where
their boss was within earshot

391
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,343
and they could have just
gone and talked to her?

392
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:08,902
Lethal Weapon?
That's it.

393
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,538
I think we should do it
the Lethal Weapon way.

394
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:13,851
You two are grown-assed men.
What do I have to do?

395
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,317
Fire you and get
two people in here

396
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,512
who don't need so
much management?

397
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:17,611
Ah!

398
00:18:17,688 --> 00:18:19,417
What I... Michael's
saying that he's better

399
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,616
at being a manager,
and I agree.

400
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:22,921
I'm just... He's a better
people person, weirdly.

401
00:18:22,994 --> 00:18:25,462
And weirdly, I'm a good
dog person, right, guys?

402
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,498
Come on. See?
They love me.

403
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,432
Fine. I don't care which
one of you does which job,

404
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:33,368
just stop meeting with me
to talk about it.

405
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,834
All right.
All right.

406
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,272
Oh.

407
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:41,835
I gotta take this. Yeah.
Finish walking my dogs for me.

408
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,682
And don't ride them. A lot
of people try to ride them.

409
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:52,052
Excuse me, everyone,
please check your emails.

410
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:54,318
I just sent you
the following message,

411
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:57,327
"Coworkers, you may have
received a valentine from me.

412
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:00,262
"Please understand this does not
mean that I like you in any way."

413
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:02,765
You don't even
like us as friends?

414
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:06,128
Phyllis, you guys are,
like, my closest friends.

415
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:08,498
I just mean I don't
like-like you.

416
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:09,631
What are we, five?

417
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:11,334
"Please don't read
into this card.

418
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:14,037
"Yours in professionalism,
Nard Dog."

419
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,538
Um, why did I just receive
a mass email from you

420
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,081
that said that
you don't like me?

421
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:20,674
Do you realize how hard
that makes me like you, Andy?

422
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:23,151
It's not... That wasn't...

423
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,120
I like someone else.

424
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:28,249
Who?

425
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:32,428
It's not...

426
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:35,825
Whether or not...

427
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:40,295
Who? What?

428
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:43,363
Yeah, I guess Andy
never liked Kelly.

429
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:45,134
How about that?

430
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:49,569
It smells good in here.

431
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:54,084
It sure does. Okay, we have your
space heater, your humidifier,

432
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,781
your dehumidifier, your fan, your
foot fan and your food dehydrator.

433
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:00,380
Erin, what about
my keyboard?

434
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:04,987
Ah.

435
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:07,993
So good to be home.

436
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:11,594
How about a little
Bossa Nova?

437
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,777
He looks happy.

438
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:27,943
Yep.

439
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:32,652
Well, well, well.
Hmm. Boss for...

440
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:34,247
What was it? Oh.

441
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,590
Four-and-a-half hours.
New record. Low.

442
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,696
Previous record,
Henry Rostin.

443
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:43,495
Boss for nine years,
four months.

444
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:46,036
And he only left because he
had family matters to attend to,

445
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:47,661
and he... What?

446
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:54,739
Michael!

447
00:20:57,748 --> 00:21:00,581
I can't help but think that
something we did made this possible.

448
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:05,111
Jim dug his own grave, but
maybe we provided the shovel.

449
00:21:05,423 --> 00:21:09,723
Temp, I like that. I'm
gonna engrave that into a piece of wood.

450
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,528
Care to celebrate
with a drink?

451
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:12,995
I would love to.

452
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:17,825
Why not?

453
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,733
Because martini bars
are pretentious.

454
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:21,294
No, thank you. I'm
sorry that I don't want

455
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:22,839
farm-boy swill
like you do, you know?

456
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,807
It is not farm-boy swill.
I will show you.

457
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,934
It is beet vodka
and it is delicious.

458
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:29,673
I'm not interested in
anything I have to make myself.
