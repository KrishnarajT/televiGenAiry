1
00:00:03,766 --> 00:00:05,700
You wanted to see me?
Yeah, have a seat.

2
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:07,258
Is it serious?

3
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:11,965
Wow. Andy's
a little scared.

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,167
Okay, right there.

5
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:16,406
Right there's the problem.

6
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:18,912
There have been reports
around the office

7
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:22,542
that you have been
talking baby talk.

8
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:23,676
Why would people
say that?

9
00:00:23,752 --> 00:00:29,122
Well, I have it on good authority
that you said the following.

10
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:30,983
Can you read that
back to me?

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,085
"Andy have a boo-boo
tummy." Mmm-hmm.

12
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:35,796
Would you rather me say,

13
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:39,823
"Hey, guys, my irritable
bowel syndrome is flaring up."

14
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:42,132
Okay. "Crazy diarrhea
happening right now."

15
00:00:42,204 --> 00:00:43,933
'Cause things can get
real adult real fast.

16
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,837
You are also on
record as saying,

17
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:48,138
"Wittle-ittle,
footie-wooties, num-nums,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,112
"jammies, make boom-boom,
widiciwus, and Whode Island."

19
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:55,382
Do I sometimes
replace Rs with Ws?

20
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:57,485
Do I sometimes repeat a
word to get my point across?

21
00:00:57,553 --> 00:01:00,613
Well, if I do,
Andy's sowwy.

22
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:03,681
You can't be a baby
in the office.

23
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,421
It makes me look
like I hire babies.

24
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:07,587
Well, if we're
complaining,

25
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:09,597
a lot of people think your
Elvis voice is annoying.

26
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:10,825
Okay. Who said that?

27
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:12,059
Just people.

28
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:15,103
For the record, I think
it's pretty fantastic.

29
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,195
Thank you.
Thank you a lot.

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,933
And for what it's worth, I
think your baby voice is tops.

31
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,999
Tank you, Mr. Elvis.

32
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:23,305
You're welcome, baby.

33
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,200
Dr. Tuna M.D., I have
some terrible news.

34
00:01:50,272 --> 00:01:51,671
Wait, are you the patient
or the doctor?

35
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,537
The entire office
has come down

36
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,271
with a pernicious
case of the Mondays.

37
00:01:56,712 --> 00:01:58,236
Wow. What do you put
our chances at?

38
00:01:58,313 --> 00:01:59,507
0%.

39
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:04,382
Unless we perform an immediate
emergency morale transplant, stat!

40
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:06,211
Sounds risky.

41
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:08,620
Don't worry.
There is a surefire cure.

42
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:13,326
Employee of the Month. Every
awesome place I've worked had one.

43
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:17,989
Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers,
AIG, my summer at Enron.

44
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,064
Wow. That's not such a bad idea. Great.

45
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:22,933
Anything else?
Nope.

46
00:02:26,074 --> 00:02:28,167
"Frankie's Dirty Joke
of the Day."

47
00:02:28,243 --> 00:02:29,835
There's a bunch of those.
Keep.

48
00:02:29,912 --> 00:02:32,437
There's a bunch of sent emails
that just say "delivered."

49
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:33,606
Should I delete those?

50
00:02:33,682 --> 00:02:36,150
I want to keep those
so I can see what I sent.

51
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,378
That's why you have
a sent mail folder.

52
00:02:37,452 --> 00:02:38,510
Keep.

53
00:02:38,587 --> 00:02:41,556
There's about three news
alerts from Nip Slip.

54
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:43,420
For what?
Nip Slip.

55
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:45,619
Okay. I don't know
how those get on there.

56
00:02:45,694 --> 00:02:46,752
Well...

57
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:48,523
Must be hackers.

58
00:02:48,597 --> 00:02:50,724
Hey, what's up?

59
00:02:51,033 --> 00:02:54,298
What if I told you I had
done the worst thing ever?

60
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:55,734
Would you still want
to be my friend?

61
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:56,998
Did you murder someone?

62
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:58,130
Worse than murder.

63
00:02:58,207 --> 00:02:59,367
Oh, my God.

64
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:01,139
Lurk much?

65
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,343
I miss Pam.

66
00:03:07,382 --> 00:03:08,406
I think she's okay.

67
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:11,145
Is that what we're
going for now? "Okay"?

68
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,915
We used to go
for "pretty good."

69
00:03:12,988 --> 00:03:14,046
Great.

70
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:15,589
Hey, how do you feel
about starting

71
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,090
an Employee of
the Month program?

72
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,560
Yeah. You know what, that
actually might make me feel better.

73
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:21,926
I'm not in this for
the trophies, but...

74
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:23,021
You're not in it at all

75
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:24,963
'cause you can't be Employee
of the Month. You're a manager.

76
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:26,557
Well, technically
I am a co-manager

77
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:28,466
and I barely have
any responsibilities.

78
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:30,903
All right. Yeah. But I work
hard, I love this company,

79
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,441
and for those reasons I think I would
make a good Employee of the Month.

80
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:34,634
It would look bad. Sorry.

81
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,076
It would look good
on my mantle.

82
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,613
Jim's talking to
Michael right now.

83
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,546
They totally
went for our idea!

84
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:44,142
Yeah! Your idea.

85
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:45,481
My idea.

86
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,482
I just need Andy to
think it's his idea

87
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:50,320
so it won't get
traced back to me.

88
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:55,262
In approximately six hours Jim will
get a phone call from David Wallace.

89
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:57,162
He will be fired.

90
00:03:57,432 --> 00:04:00,993
Hey, Pam, do you have a sec
to check over this itinerary?

91
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:03,193
Looks great.

92
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:06,173
Did you really look it over?
Felt like maybe you didn't.

93
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:07,367
Okay.

94
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:11,738
The Michael Scott Foundation
is still in existence.

95
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,680
There you are. I don't think
we have finished with my inbox.

96
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,615
What's "Scott's Tots"?

97
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:24,351
Has it really
been 10 years?

98
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,196
Michael, why did you
promise that?

99
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:37,533
To change lives.

100
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:40,473
No. Michael, why would you promise that?

101
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,134
You know...
Okay. I can't...

102
00:04:42,377 --> 00:04:44,709
Call the school, cancel.
I can't go through with this.

103
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,680
We've already rescheduled seven times.

104
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:50,309
Michael, this is a terrible,
terrible thing you've done.

105
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:51,409
Well...

106
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:54,580
It's terrible.
Just terrible.

107
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:57,657
And the longer you put it
off, the worse it's gonna get.

108
00:04:57,793 --> 00:05:00,387
I just... I fell in
love with these kids,

109
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:03,260
and I didn't want to see them
fall victim to the system.

110
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:04,390
So I made them
a promise.

111
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:07,367
I told them that if they
graduated from high school,

112
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:10,530
I would pay for their
college education.

113
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:14,200
I have made some empty
promises in my life,

114
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,801
but hands down, that
was the most generous.

115
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,140
Just tell me it is going
to be okay, all right?

116
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:20,238
No!

117
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:23,148
I'm not a bad-news person.
I bring good news,

118
00:05:23,218 --> 00:05:25,550
like when I promised those
kids I'd pay for college.

119
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:29,054
Okay. All right.

120
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:30,455
You have to tell them.

121
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:35,295
Would you come with me? You know,
like old times? Instead of...

122
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:39,901
I can print out a new
itinerary with Pam's name on it.

123
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:42,336
It's fine.
Erin, you're gonna go,

124
00:05:42,404 --> 00:05:44,269
and you're gonna make sure
Michael tells the truth.

125
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,365
Oh, God. You know what?
Could this day get any worse?

126
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:51,039
Hey, Jimmy, what's up?

127
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,171
Not much.

128
00:05:52,247 --> 00:05:55,410
Cool. Very cool.
I bet if you tried,

129
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:59,018
you could grow the best beard
of anyone in this office.

130
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:00,247
Thanks, Dwight.

131
00:06:00,322 --> 00:06:01,721
That laugh is
so infectious.

132
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,054
You're creeping me out.
I'm gonna go.

133
00:06:04,126 --> 00:06:06,356
I didn't mean any of
those things I just said.

134
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:10,023
And you can expect the same
thing from everyone in this office

135
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:13,397
if you don't nip this whole Employee
of the Month situation in the bud.

136
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:15,698
Make it about
the work.

137
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,636
Let me guess. You
think you should get it.

138
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,266
This encompasses
all available data.

139
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,910
Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed
sick days, participation.

140
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:28,742
Everyone has been assigned
a random number

141
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:31,445
for total fairness
and transparency.

142
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:34,481
Also, this should be
accompanied by a monetary prize.

143
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,251
Well, in an ideal
world... In an ideal world

144
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:38,053
I would have all 10
fingers on my left hand,

145
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,060
so my right hand could
just be a fist for punching.

146
00:06:40,128 --> 00:06:41,527
Okay. If it's all
the same to you,

147
00:06:41,596 --> 00:06:44,360
I'm just gonna take away
survival skills and self-defense.

148
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,628
I'm gonna run this
by Toby and Accounting

149
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,191
and have them
assemble the data.

150
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,170
It's okay,
I'll do it.

151
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:55,840
Mr. Scott?

152
00:06:57,012 --> 00:07:00,072
Hey! Mikela Lasker!
How are you?

153
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:01,172
I'm good.

154
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,477
Good to see you.
Where's your saxophone?

155
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:04,143
It's in the music room,
Mr. Scott.

156
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,187
Eighth-grade graduation,
she gave a rendition

157
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:08,882
of When the Saints Go Marching In
that would blow your freaking mind.

158
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:09,946
Wow.

159
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:11,049
Well, you didn't
even hear it.

160
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,151
Everyone's so excited
that you're here today.

161
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:14,217
Oh, good.
Now,

162
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:16,196
I know you probably
want to see everyone,

163
00:07:16,264 --> 00:07:18,528
but I was wondering if I could
ask you some questions first.

164
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,999
Sure.
You're famous.

165
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm sure you remember
this place. Oh, yeah.

166
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:23,495
Do you want to go in?

167
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:24,800
No, not at all.
Nope. Come on.

168
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,271
You know what? You know,
I shouldn't go in there.

169
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:30,606
I'm pretty busy.
I shouldn't...

170
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:33,147
We just want
to say thanks.

171
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:41,616
Mr. Scott!
Mr. Scott! Mr. Scott!

172
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,679
Mr. Scott!

173
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:45,992
Mr. Scott,
I know you're a busy man

174
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:47,892
and your schedule
moves around a lot,

175
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:51,758
but for all your generosity
through the years, your tots,

176
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:53,657
who are ready
to graduate,

177
00:07:53,735 --> 00:07:57,000
thought it was time to
give you a proper thank you.

178
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:06,712
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

179
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:09,249
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

180
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:11,785
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

181
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:14,151
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

182
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:17,055
You came into our lives and made
a promise That made us honest

183
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,060
Made us realize
We don't need to compromise

184
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:21,686
'Cause we can have it all

185
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:26,097
'Cause you made it possible
For us to achieve the improbable

186
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:29,295
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

187
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,771
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

188
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,832
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

189
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,768
Wow!

190
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,078
Hey. So Jim thought
it would be ideal...

191
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:51,489
Hey.
if we all pitched in...

192
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,283
So, Jim thought
it would be ideal

193
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:57,297
if we all pitched in a 20 for this
whole Employee of the Month thing.

194
00:08:57,365 --> 00:08:58,525
Jim said that?

195
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,592
He thought you were doing
an incredible job last month.

196
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,103
Jim said that?

197
00:09:03,171 --> 00:09:04,297
You seem surprised.

198
00:09:04,706 --> 00:09:07,004
No, no, that makes
total sense.

199
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,781
Hey, buddy.
So everyone...

200
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:21,278
Five minutes ahead of
schedule. Right on schedule.

201
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:23,948
Politicians are
always coming around,

202
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:28,086
telling us they're gonna fix our
schools, promising this and that.

203
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,096
But you, Mr. Scott,
you are actually doing it!

204
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:37,701
You have taught these kids, with
hard work, that anything is possible.

205
00:09:38,106 --> 00:09:41,439
You are a dream maker,
and I thank you.

206
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:46,140
I thank you. I thank you,
I thank you, I thank you.

207
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,248
There were a lot of
times over the years

208
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:55,414
where I was pressured
to get into the drug game.

209
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,482
But I always thought back
to my guardian angel

210
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:00,823
and the gift
that you gave me.

211
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,864
So I just want to thank you
for giving me the opportunity

212
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,332
to go to college,
educate myself,

213
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,562
and become
the next President Obama.

214
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,366
Oh, God.

215
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:18,012
Okay, ladies and
gentlemen, welcome.

216
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,412
I know you're all very excited,
but no matter who gets this,

217
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:23,348
I just want to say
that you guys are all

218
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:24,942
Employees of the Month
in my eyes.

219
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:30,622
And the winner is employee
number nine, and that is...

220
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:35,486
Number nine,
number nine, Jim Halpert.

221
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:36,689
- What?
- What?

222
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:38,699
Are you kidding me?
Oh, no.

223
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,235
Okay, wait.
I was not...

224
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,066
I did not get...

225
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,767
"I did not...
That was not...

226
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:48,733
"How come not..."

227
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,902
Guys, listen.

228
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,502
This was anonymous,
all right?

229
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,274
There's no way I could
have given it to myself,

230
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:55,543
because I didn't even know
who was on here.

231
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:57,710
I just gave it to the employee
with the highest overall score.

232
00:10:57,786 --> 00:11:00,687
To my tally, you just won
back your own parking spot,

233
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:04,589
a vacation day, and a nice tidy
quarter of $1,000 from all of us.

234
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:06,126
Will everybody just
stop for a second?

235
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:07,752
'Cause obviously I'm
not taking any of it.

236
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:09,820
A mistake has been made
and we'll figure it out.

237
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,490
Second of all,
there was no cash prize.

238
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:12,590
Yes!

239
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:13,895
Dwight?
Yeah, you said,

240
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:15,663
"In an ideal world, there
would be a cash prize."

241
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:17,637
Isn't that what you
said? No, Dwight, I meant,

242
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:20,368
yes, in a perfect world, someone
would get money, but not...

243
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:23,775
Yeah, but, in your perfect
world, only you get money.

244
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:25,540
- Yeah, that's...
- Don't do this...

245
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,547
I know, all right? Don't do...

246
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,743
Let's put your hands together
and give a warm welcome

247
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,720
for the man of the hour,
Mr. Michael Scott.

248
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,391
Thank you.

249
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:46,197
All right. Wow.

250
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:51,368
I am never going to
forget today. Not a chance.

251
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:55,865
I don't think I could ever give back
to you what you have given me today.

252
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:58,708
Who here's done something
stupid in their lives?

253
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,873
Like skipped out
on study hall

254
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:03,008
or mix up the difference
between A gym and B gym,

255
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:04,483
that sort of thing?
Show of hands.

256
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:07,043
Anybody? Yes,
a bunch of you. Okay.

257
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:11,491
Well, me, too. I've done something
stupid, which I would like to share.

258
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,886
Um...

259
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,156
Should we go?

260
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:19,598
No, no, we're okay.
It's a double period.

261
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:24,737
All right. I came here today
because I promised you tuition,

262
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,969
and tuition is
very valuable.

263
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,771
But you know
what's invaluable?

264
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:32,108
Is intuition.
You know what that is?

265
00:12:32,714 --> 00:12:36,548
That is the ability to know when
something is about to happen.

266
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,210
Does anybody out there
have intuition?

267
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,381
Know what's gonna
happen next?

268
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:45,255
Nobody? Okay. You're
gonna make me say it.

269
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,619
All right. I am so proud of all of you.

270
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:55,300
Derrick and Lefervre
and Ben and Ayana

271
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,466
and Mikela and Nikki
and Jason and...

272
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:02,433
I'm sorry, okay, I'm
sort of spacing your name.

273
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,603
I'm Zion. I'm Mikela's younger brother.

274
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:07,341
Well, Zion, I am not going
to be paying for your tuition.

275
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:12,519
Which brings me
to my main point,

276
00:13:12,587 --> 00:13:16,318
and that is that I will not be
able to pay for anybody's tuition.

277
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,353
I'm so, so sorry.

278
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:24,255
- What?
- You're kidding.

279
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:25,663
Excuse me?

280
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:32,503
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:36,367
Explain yourself, sir!

282
00:13:36,444 --> 00:13:38,412
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:39,770
I'm so sorry.

284
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:40,974
You lied to us.

285
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:45,844
Yep. I lied to myself, too.
I'm not a millionaire.

286
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:50,052
I thought I would be by the time
I was 30, but I wasn't even close,

287
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:52,490
and then I thought maybe
by the time I was 40,

288
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,427
but by 40 I had less
money than when I was 30.

289
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:57,123
Maybe by my 50s,
I don't know.

290
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,326
I wanted to pay
for your education.

291
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:04,204
I really did.
It was my dream.

292
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:08,942
Some people have evil dreams,
some people have selfish dreams,

293
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:12,112
or wet dreams. My dream
was in the right place.

294
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,579
You owe this to us.

295
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,445
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

296
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:19,744
Now, I can't pay
for your college,

297
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:24,781
but you don't have to go
to class to be in class.

298
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:28,895
Online courses
are a viable option

299
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:30,954
to a traditional
college experience,

300
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,630
and the best way to
access those courses

301
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:36,761
is with your own
personal laptop,

302
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:41,069
which is rendered
useless without batteries,

303
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:42,666
and I have one
for each of you.

304
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:52,016
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on. They're lithium.

305
00:14:56,858 --> 00:15:00,885
Look, there was a big mistake,
obviously, so I will fix it. Okay?

306
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:03,091
This was
your idea anyway.

307
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:05,997
Correction.
It was my idea.

308
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,159
Okay.

309
00:15:07,368 --> 00:15:08,596
My idea.

310
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:11,631
Guys, I'm starting to think
Pam's not even pregnant.

311
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:14,937
Okay, for the record,
I am pregnant,

312
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,603
and obviously there's been
some kind of a mistake,

313
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,513
so why doesn't Jim just pick the
next highest score on the list

314
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:22,947
and we'll move on.

315
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:24,541
Yeah, okay.
That's fair.

316
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,587
Excellent idea, Pam.
Thank you.

317
00:15:26,654 --> 00:15:30,681
That would be employee
number three, which is...

318
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,483
Son of a bitch!

319
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:35,190
Pam Halpert.
- What?

320
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,895
How is that possible?

321
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:41,026
No offense, Pam, but how
the hell is that possible?

322
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:44,434
There must be some reasonable
explanation for this.

323
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:47,269
Wait, come on.
I didn't miss a day,

324
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:49,139
I came in early,
I stayed late,

325
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,141
and I doubled my
sales last month.

326
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:53,373
Oh, really? From what? Two to four?

327
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:54,506
Yep.

328
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:57,516
Guys, this isn't some
elaborate scam, okay?

329
00:15:57,852 --> 00:16:01,379
Hi, I have an order here for
a custom cake. Jim Halpert.

330
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:04,955
Okay. That is me, but
I didn't order the cake.

331
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,923
Look who it is.

332
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:12,699
He knew all along.

333
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,132
I'm gonna
have some cake.

334
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,294
David Wallace's office.

335
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,339
This is Kevin Malone.
Is David there?

336
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:21,635
No, he's in his weekly staff
meeting. Can I take a message?

337
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:27,944
Tell him I'm mad at Jim 'cause
he's asking us to give money to Pam.

338
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:33,652
This is Stanley Hudson.
Jim Halpert is a menace.

339
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:38,988
It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things
are getting really bad down here.

340
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:45,756
Hey, Mr. Scott.

341
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:51,034
Erin, can you
give us a second?

342
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:52,998
That was messed up
what you did.

343
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:54,598
Yeah, yeah,
I know. I know.

344
00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:55,903
I know, I'm sorry.

345
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,672
Who does something
like that?

346
00:16:57,745 --> 00:16:59,542
Who promises that
to a bunch of kids

347
00:16:59,614 --> 00:17:02,549
and then just doesn't
come through like that?

348
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:04,910
What can I do?

349
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:06,578
You could pay
for my college.

350
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:10,488
I can give you an extra laptop
battery. Not everyone took one.

351
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:16,320
How about this?

352
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:22,061
If you can find a way to pay for your
tuition, let me buy your books, okay?

353
00:17:22,136 --> 00:17:23,194
They're expensive.

354
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:26,240
Yeah, well, I owe you
that at least, right?

355
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:28,041
It's about $1,000.

356
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,168
Really? Wow.

357
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:32,811
That's over $200 a year.

358
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,780
No, $1,000 each year.

359
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:37,511
For... Okay. Okay.

360
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:42,714
Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna
write four checks for $1,000 each.

361
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,951
I'm going to date them
one year apart.

362
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:47,119
Now, you are to use
one check a year,

363
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:49,356
and please call me
before you cash the check,

364
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,660
'cause I've got monies to
move around. Yeah, yeah.

365
00:17:51,732 --> 00:17:54,223
Okay? Make it out to my Aunt Rosa.

366
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:57,103
That's a lot of zeroes.

367
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:01,132
This is Jim.

368
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:02,540
Jim, what the hell
is happening there?

369
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,601
Hey, David.
Yes?

370
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:08,040
So, there was a little bit of
a miscommunication here today.

371
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:10,744
It's been a little wild,
but I am on it.

372
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:13,878
Just so I understand, you
started Employee of the Month,

373
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,445
give it to yourself,

374
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:17,787
then people complain, so
you give it to your wife?

375
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,258
No.
Am I missing something?

376
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:20,988
I really don't know
how it happened, David.

377
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:22,962
I know how it happened.

378
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:33,066
Jim, I bumped you up because I
thought you could make my life easier.

379
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:36,907
If you can't do that, we're
gonna have a separate discussion.

380
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:40,072
All right, it will
not happen again. I promise.

381
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:44,641
I am sorry. I am taking this out on you.

382
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:47,515
No. But things have been crazy here.

383
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,681
You know I think you're
doing a great job, right?

384
00:18:49,757 --> 00:18:52,089
What? No.
Yeah. Thank you.

385
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:55,787
Okay. We still
on for dinner this weekend?

386
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:57,125
What?
Yes.

387
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:59,689
Okay. See you.
You're kidding me!

388
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:01,362
Damn it!

389
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,695
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

390
00:19:04,772 --> 00:19:07,400
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

391
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:10,171
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

392
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:11,643
Please stop.

393
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:15,547
Fifteen lives.

394
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:19,211
I destroyed
15 young lives today.

395
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:20,754
No.
Yes.

396
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:24,014
No, there's
financial aid.

397
00:19:26,194 --> 00:19:28,287
They could join
the Army or the Navy.

398
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:30,728
Maybe...
You're, what, like, 12?

399
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:37,967
The principal
told me that

400
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,735
90% of Scott's Tots are
on track to graduate,

401
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:44,005
and that's 35% higher
than the rest of the school,

402
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:47,107
so I think that if you
hadn't made that promise,

403
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:49,615
a lot of them
would have dropped out,

404
00:19:49,684 --> 00:19:52,050
which is something to
think about, I think.

405
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:03,761
I think you're
doing a great job.

406
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:05,762
Really?

407
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:09,963
What do you want
from this job,

408
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:13,302
provided the company
doesn't go out of business?

409
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:16,104
Well, I've always wondered what it
might be like to be an accountant.

410
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:17,235
Really?

411
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,676
Yes, but I'm
terrible at math.

412
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:21,374
Well, you know,
when I hired Kevin,

413
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:25,181
he was actually applying
for a job in the warehouse.

414
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,347
Seriously?
Yeah.

415
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:30,651
I just sort of had
a feeling about him.

416
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,690
Have a feeling
about you, too.

417
00:20:37,832 --> 00:20:40,562
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

418
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:43,570
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

419
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:46,505
Hey, Mr. Scott,
what you gonna do

420
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:49,008
What you gonna do
Make our dreams come true

421
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:50,065
Yeah!

422
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:55,605
See you
tomorrow, Dwight.

423
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:57,082
Apparently.

424
00:20:57,952 --> 00:21:00,750
How's it going? Good day? Not now, temp.

425
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:06,585
Okay. So, listen, I know
about your diabolical plan.

426
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:13,257
What? Diabolical plan? I
wouldn't even know how to begin...

427
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:16,765
I found a copy of it
in the copier tray.

428
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:18,532
So what do you want?

429
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:20,267
I want the same thing
you want.

430
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:23,936
I want to take Jim
Halpert down. I want in.
