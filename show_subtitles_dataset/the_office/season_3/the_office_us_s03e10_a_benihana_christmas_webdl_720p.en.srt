1
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,668
Merry Christmas.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,271
Why are you...
why did you bring that here?

3
00:00:09,273 --> 00:00:10,639
Don't worry.
She's dead.

4
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:12,308
Oh, wait...

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,409
He's dead.

6
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,112
Dwight, what... uhh!

7
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:17,446
I accidentally ran over it.

8
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:18,714
It's a Christmas miracle.

9
00:00:18,716 --> 00:00:19,715
Well, get it out of here.

10
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:21,784
Relax, okay?

11
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:22,952
And because this is Christmas,

12
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:24,420
I am going to roast this goose

13
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:27,623
and prepare it with
a wild rice dressing.

14
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,659
Do we have any cayenne pepper
in the kitchen?

15
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,461
Merry Christmas, Dwight.

16
00:00:32,463 --> 00:00:33,462
Jim.

17
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:34,864
Wow.
What have we got here?

18
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:35,898
What does it look like?

19
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,533
Dead goose.

20
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:38,901
And circle gets the square.

21
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:40,269
All right.

22
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,504
So can you watch this?

23
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:42,505
I'm gonna get my carving knife

24
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:43,806
out of the trunk.

25
00:00:43,808 --> 00:00:45,174
Ah, Dwight,
we talked about this.

26
00:00:45,176 --> 00:00:47,109
No, Toby, this is different.

27
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:48,444
He is already dead.

28
00:00:48,446 --> 00:00:51,614
Once, I brought in a duck
to prepare for lunch.

29
00:00:51,616 --> 00:00:53,482
And people got upset.

30
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:56,752
Apparently, they
got attached to the duck

31
00:00:56,754 --> 00:00:58,287
and didn't want
to see it killed.

32
00:00:58,289 --> 00:00:59,622
He was already dead.

33
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:01,824
And we Schrutes use
every part of the goose.

34
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:05,394
The meat has a delicious,
smoky, rich flavor.

35
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:07,129
Plus, you can use
the molten goose grease

36
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:08,497
and save it in the refrigerator.

37
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:09,565
Thus saving you
a trip to the store

38
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,200
for a can
of expensive goose grease.

39
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:13,269
Wow, win-win.

40
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,471
Exactly.
Thank you, Jim.

41
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:16,806
I like goose.
And it's already dead.

42
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:18,107
Is it so crazy if we eat it?

43
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:19,809
That is crazy.
It's crazy.

44
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:21,977
Dwight, you cannot
keep that here.

45
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:23,546
Okay, that is ridiculous.

46
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:25,748
And totally against
the spirit of Christmas.

47
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,216
Come on, Dwight.

48
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:31,053
We went over this, like,
for a half an hour.

49
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:32,721
It's Christmas, Toby.

50
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:35,825
It's a dead animal
in our office, you can't...

51
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:37,092
Toby...

52
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:38,127
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:39,163 --> 00:01:40,796
Please?

54
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:42,364
Please?

55
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:48,971
Clean it in your car.

56
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:50,973
I would like it off my desk.

57
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:53,375
Oh, Pam.
Take a chill pill.

58
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:36,285
Ah!

59
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,887
Hey!

60
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,622
I would like

61
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:41,323
a nice slice

62
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:43,292
of Christmas Pam.

63
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,860
Side of candy Pams.

64
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:46,595
And perhaps...

65
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:48,964
some Pam chops.

66
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:50,532
- Can I help you, Michael?
- With mint.

67
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:53,168
I'm looking for
the toy drive box.

68
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,169
It's behind you.

69
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:55,604
Okay.

70
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:58,207
Well, I need to put
this bike in there.

71
00:02:58,209 --> 00:02:59,241
I hope it'll fit

72
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,610
with all these little
knickknacks.

73
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:04,079
Wow.
What kind of bike is that?

74
00:03:04,081 --> 00:03:06,815
Um, I don't know.
Average kind.

75
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,651
The tires look pretty worn.

76
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:11,320
Well, that is probably
from the test drive.

77
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:12,621
But the paint's chipping.

78
00:03:12,623 --> 00:03:14,490
Is that your old bike, Michael?

79
00:03:14,492 --> 00:03:16,191
No.

80
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:17,459
Yo, Michael.
Sweet ride, Mike.

81
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,527
Oh, thanks.

82
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,131
Michael...

83
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,399
Yes?

84
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:25,601
Oh, Pam.

85
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:27,236
That is so sweet.

86
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:28,604
You didn't have to do that.

87
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:29,772
I didn't.
It's from corporate.

88
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,407
Okay.

89
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:32,574
Did everybody get one of these?

90
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:33,776
- Yep.
- Terrific.

91
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,077
Good.

92
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,579
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

93
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:40,349
My girlfriend Carol
is coming to our party tonight.

94
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:43,218
And I have a little
surprise for her.

95
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:54,330
Um, taking her to Sandals,
Jamaica.

96
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,031
All-inclusive.

97
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,366
All-inclusive.

98
00:03:57,368 --> 00:03:59,335
You know what that means.

99
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:00,803
Right?

100
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:02,037
Yeah.

101
00:04:09,212 --> 00:04:12,348
Oh, I think you're supposed
to put a toy in the box, Creed.

102
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,049
And a happy holiday to you.

103
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:21,490
Carol.

104
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,192
Hi, is Michael around here?

105
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:24,426
There she is!

106
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:26,061
A Christmas Carol.

107
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,262
Hello.

108
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:31,066
You're about five hours
early to the party.

109
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:34,036
Oh, you're such a blonde.

110
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:35,337
- Michael...
- Hey, everybody!

111
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:38,540
I don't know who you
haven't met yet,

112
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,209
but I think this is one of them.

113
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,511
This is my girlfriend, Carol.

114
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:44,046
This is just the front of her.

115
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:46,048
Show 'em...
show 'em the other side.

116
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,583
- What?
- Turn around.

117
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:49,351
Turn around.
Come on.

118
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,853
Get out of here.

119
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,321
Oh, you get out of here.

120
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:53,322
- Michael...
- Yes?

121
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:54,556
If I may say,

122
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:56,325
she's even prettier
than you described her.

123
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:57,893
Oh, ouch!

124
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,029
Michael, I don't think
there's anything wrong

125
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,730
with the way you described her.

126
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:02,831
Thank you.

127
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,233
I really need a moment
alone with you.

128
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:07,236
Not as much as I need
a moment alone with you.

129
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:08,470
Brrp!

130
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:13,208
What is this?

131
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,577
That is my Christmas card.

132
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:18,147
It's a picture of you and me
and your kids on a ski trip,

133
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:19,314
having a blast.

134
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:20,749
"Ski-son's Greetings."

135
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:24,053
No, see, we never
went on a ski trip.

136
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:25,154
I know, I know.

137
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:26,622
- I went on a ski trip...
- Right.

138
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:29,058
Two years ago, with my kids
and my ex-husband.

139
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,460
Yes, but what you didn't
realize at the time

140
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,263
was that I was with you,
in a sense.

141
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:36,031
- I was in your heart.
- Michael...

142
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,533
And next to your kids.
What?

143
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:40,069
This is so weird.

144
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:41,703
I don't understand.

145
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:43,972
It's a bold move
to Photoshop yourself

146
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:46,475
into a picture with your
girlfriend and her kids

147
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:48,877
on a ski trip
with their real father.

148
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,880
But then again,
Michael's a bold guy.

149
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:53,649
Is bold the right word?

150
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:55,384
I think you're
a really sweet guy.

151
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:56,518
Okay.

152
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,686
But, um...

153
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,288
I don't know how to deal with...

154
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,191
with, like this... thing.

155
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:04,293
And... and the proposal.

156
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:06,762
And I don't think things
are gonna work out with us.

157
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:07,930
No, no, no, no.
Okay, okay.

158
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,998
You know what?
You're not thinking straight.

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,100
You know what you need?

160
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:13,168
You need...

161
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,603
to think this through in...

162
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,575
Jamaica's largest
freshwater pool.

163
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,777
What are you talking about?

164
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,779
I got us tickets...

165
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:26,048
to Sandals, Jamaica.

166
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,216
We leave day after tomorrow.

167
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:28,617
You had better find

168
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:31,553
the skimpiest bikini there is.

169
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:32,588
Michael...

170
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,022
And it's all-inclusive.

171
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,358
Michael...
Yes?

172
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,926
I'm sorry.

173
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:40,996
No, Carol.

174
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:42,564
You walk out that door,
and it is over.

175
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:44,466
I know.

176
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:52,574
Psst!

177
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:53,942
Jim.

178
00:07:01,117 --> 00:07:02,317
Um, hey.

179
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,452
Hey.

180
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:05,154
I need to give you
your Christmas gift now.

181
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:06,889
Because, um...

182
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,257
Well, I'll just tell you.

183
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,825
What?

184
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,927
For the past few months,

185
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:16,398
I've been sending Dwight
letters from the CIA.

186
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:19,902
Are you serious?

187
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:22,538
They're considering him
for a top-secret mission.

188
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,072
There's his application.

189
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:25,641
And this is where
I made him list

190
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:28,844
every secret he promised
he'd never, ever tell.

191
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,247
"Last year, my boss,
Michael Scott,

192
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,550
"took a day off, 'cause
he said he had pneumonia,

193
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:35,951
"but really,
he was leaving early

194
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:37,519
to go to magic camp."

195
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,588
Wow.

196
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,789
So here's the gift.

197
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:43,959
You get to decide
what his top secret mission is.

198
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,961
Sorry I didn't wrap it.

199
00:07:49,465 --> 00:07:51,667
You know what?
Um...

200
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:53,035
I really don't think

201
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,037
I should be doing this stuff
anymore, though.

202
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,372
Oh.

203
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:58,874
No, just 'cause
of the promotion.

204
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,609
Oh, yeah. Just feels a
little bit like, uh...

205
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:01,677
No, I get it.

206
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,445
Of course.

207
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:04,947
Okay.

208
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,048
Oh.

209
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:18,026
I feel like there's a chance
for me to start over.

210
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,895
And... if I fall back

211
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:23,232
into the same kind of things
I used to do, then...

212
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:24,967
what am I doing?

213
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:32,674
I'd like everybody's attention.

214
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:35,143
Christmas is canceled.

215
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:36,678
You can't cancel a holiday.

216
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,714
Keep it up, Stanley,
and you will lose New Year's.

217
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:39,848
What does that mean?

218
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,116
Jim, take New Year's
away from Stanley!

219
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:42,150
Michael,

220
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:43,218
what's going on?

221
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:49,925
Carol and I...

222
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,561
split up.

223
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:54,229
Amicably.

224
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,098
And I just don't think
it would be appropriate

225
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,634
to celebrate
under the circumst...

226
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,068
Will they still air Rudolph?

227
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,204
That's not fair.

228
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:03,605
Are we going to cancel
Hanukkah as well?

229
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,408
Fine!

230
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,110
Have your party!

231
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,312
Just no guests.

232
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:12,314
But we invited guests.

233
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:14,983
Well, you know what, Phyllis?

234
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,285
All of your guests

235
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,120
would have probably canceled

236
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,855
at the last minute anyway.

237
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,089
Leaving your life

238
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,892
a stupid, rotten mess.

239
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:26,128
Okay.

240
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:35,037
It hurts.

241
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,838
I know.

242
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,274
It hurts my heart.

243
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:42,377
It hurts my stomach.

244
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:44,579
Hurts my arms.

245
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:47,149
Okay, well, why are you
laying like that?

246
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:49,418
Thanks.

247
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,687
How did you push away
the bad thoughts?

248
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:53,021
Like what?

249
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:56,692
Like maybe
the real reason they left

250
00:09:56,694 --> 00:10:00,028
was because...
there were things

251
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,531
they wanted you to do

252
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,566
in bed... that were...

253
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:07,469
- Wha... um...
- ... foreign and scary.

254
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:09,204
I... I don't believe...

255
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:11,173
And not that you didn't
wanna try them.

256
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:13,342
Some wine might have helped.

257
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,110
Do you know
what I'm referring to?

258
00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:16,712
I don't need to know.

259
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:18,113
Michael...
Yep?

260
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:19,314
Sorry to interrupt.

261
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:21,817
It appears we're
one bathrobe short.

262
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,385
Take it from Toby.

263
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:25,721
Copy.

264
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:28,357
Pam, would you like to go
to Sandals, Jamaica with me?

265
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,391
No, thank you.

266
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:30,459
It's all... okay.

267
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:34,196
Hey, Dwight.

268
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,366
Some pretty nice robes there.

269
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,601
Why?

270
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:41,803
Phyllis, I need you
to pick up green streamers

271
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:43,605
at lunch.

272
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:44,940
I thought you said
green was whorish.

273
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:48,343
No, orange is whorish.

274
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:52,581
Uh, so I had a couple of ideas

275
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,650
to make the Stamford people
feel more at home.

276
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:57,853
Each year,
we have a Christmas raffle.

277
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:59,955
Cool. It would never work here.

278
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,391
Okay.

279
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:05,394
Um, another idea was...
karaoke.

280
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,295
No.

281
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:08,463
A Christmas drinking game.

282
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:09,464
Yes.

283
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,466
God help you.

284
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:12,501
What?

285
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:15,303
These are all terrible ideas.

286
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:16,838
And none of them
are on the theme

287
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,107
of a Nutcracker Christmas.

288
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,942
I think you should leave.

289
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:23,145
You're kidding.

290
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:24,513
You tried this out.

291
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,615
And it's clearly not for you.

292
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:28,116
It's time to go.

293
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:32,521
Come on.

294
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:34,389
Please?
Thank you.

295
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:38,026
Okay.
Thank you very much.

296
00:11:49,406 --> 00:11:50,672
What are you doing?

297
00:11:50,674 --> 00:11:52,207
We are getting rid of everything

298
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:54,209
that reminds you of Carol.

299
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:57,412
Hey, what's a-haps?

300
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:58,947
Carol?

301
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,348
No.

302
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,617
Oh, look at this.

303
00:12:02,619 --> 00:12:05,287
Your old condo closing papers.

304
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,022
Ew, it's riddled
with Carol's name.

305
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:09,624
I wish I could
throw this in the box.

306
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:20,936
Why don't you just
buy the whole song?

307
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:23,472
I don't have to buy it.

308
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,640
I just wanna taste it.

309
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:27,209
That's all.

310
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:30,612
I just want
a little taste of it.

311
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:32,047
Oh, look at this.

312
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:33,815
She saved you $2,000

313
00:12:33,817 --> 00:12:38,053
'cause they failed to report
a mold problem.

314
00:12:38,055 --> 00:12:39,955
But wouldn't that
affect the final...

315
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:41,156
How did she...

316
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:43,625
Oh... oh, I see
what she did.

317
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:46,495
That is good.
Wow.

318
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:48,997
That Carol is one smart cookie.

319
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,983
This is an old adage,

320
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:11,152
but they say that when
you find true love,

321
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:14,189
you know within
the first 24 hours.

322
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:16,858
With Carol,

323
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,895
I knew within
the first 24 minutes

324
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:22,564
of the second day I met her.

325
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:35,377
I feel like I've been
kind of cold to Karen.

326
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,178
And there's
no real reason for it.

327
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,215
I mean, it's not like she's ever
done anything to me.

328
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:43,485
So... I think I probably
shouldn't be cold to her.

329
00:13:43,487 --> 00:13:46,621
Hey... Karen...
um...

330
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,722
Sorry about that meeting today.

331
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,224
That was really crazy.

332
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:51,293
Yeah, right?
I'm so glad you said that.

333
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:53,828
Because I don't know how
those meetings usually go.

334
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,697
Um, usually like that.

335
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:57,566
Does anyone ever
stand up to Angela?

336
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,301
I think one of her cats
did once.

337
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:01,503
She came in with scratches
all over her face.

338
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,738
Right.

339
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,875
Um... I really liked
your karaoke idea.

340
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:07,909
Oh, cool, yeah.

341
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:09,044
That could really be fun.

342
00:14:09,046 --> 00:14:10,312
You guys do a raffle?

343
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,580
Yeah, we do a raffle.

344
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:17,218
Hey, Kev.

345
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,386
Hey.

346
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,001
This should have
been up yesterday.

347
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,569
It'll be all right.

348
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,873
What is that?

349
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,542
"The Committee to Plan Parties

350
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:42,944
invites you to
a Margarita-Karaoke Christmas."

351
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:45,113
There's no such thing as
the Committee to Plan Parties.

352
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:46,982
There is now.
We just started it.

353
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,950
Well, you can't just
start a committee.

354
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:50,352
You have to have funding.

355
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,386
What's your funding?

356
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:52,454
$200.

357
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:53,521
What's ours again?

358
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:54,556
Um, $201.

359
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:55,557
Right.

360
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,625
Hey!

361
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:58,426
A Margarita-Karaoke
Christmas party.

362
00:14:58,428 --> 00:14:59,527
That sounds like fun.

363
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:00,962
No, that is not a party.

364
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:02,230
There's only one party,

365
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:03,798
and it's hosted by the party
planning committee,

366
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,434
and it starts at 3:00.

367
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:07,702
Then why are there two flyers?

368
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:09,804
I understand that this
is confusing for everyone.

369
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,072
Let me explain.

370
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:12,907
There's a party
that starts at 3:00.

371
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:14,242
Right.

372
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,477
And then there's
a way more fun party

373
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,578
that starts at 2:45.

374
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,246
Right, and if you're interested

375
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:19,547
in the way more fun party,

376
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:20,949
all the info can be found here

377
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:23,551
on our more
brightly-colored flyer.

378
00:15:29,593 --> 00:15:31,426
I didn't see where it was.

379
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:34,929
Yep, looks like
the Scranton people

380
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:36,197
and the Stamford people

381
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,166
are finally coming together.

382
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:40,268
And that's what you want, right?

383
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,938
I think that's a really good...

384
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,907
Pam and Karen, I am ordering you

385
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:48,910
to cease and desist all party
planning immediately.

386
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:50,712
You can't do that.

387
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:51,946
As ranking number three
in this office...

388
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:53,715
Um, eh...
I'm number three.

389
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:54,783
You're number four.

390
00:15:54,785 --> 00:15:56,151
- Yeah, but I'm number three.
- Uh, no.

391
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:58,520
You must turn over to me
all Christmas decorations

392
00:15:58,522 --> 00:15:59,788
and party paraphernalia
immediately

393
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,356
that will be returned to you
on January 4th.

394
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:03,091
Okay, I think I can help here.

395
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,259
Okay, good.

396
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:05,994
As ranking number two,
I am starting a committee

397
00:16:05,996 --> 00:16:08,163
to determine the validity
of the two committees.

398
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:09,664
And I am the sole member.

399
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,199
The committee will act
on this now.

400
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,400
Okay, this is stupid.

401
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,868
Could you please keep it down?
I'm in session.

402
00:16:16,706 --> 00:16:18,506
I've determined
this committee is valid.

403
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:19,541
What? No, no!

404
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:20,709
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

405
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:22,577
Permission to join
the validity committee.

406
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:26,715
Permission denied.

407
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:28,016
Damn it!

408
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:32,320
Hey.

409
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:34,856
I can't concentrate when
I know you're in pain, man.

410
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:36,558
Let me take you to lunch.

411
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:40,395
Come on, my treat.

412
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:42,130
All right.

413
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:44,566
Nothing here to distract
myself with anyway.

414
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:46,234
That's my boy.

415
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:48,036
I know the perfect place too.

416
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:49,070
Hooters?

417
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:51,239
No, Benihana.

418
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,041
Much classier.

419
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:54,843
But don't worry.

420
00:16:54,845 --> 00:16:57,045
The babes are totally hot too.

421
00:16:58,749 --> 00:17:00,915
Well, I need my entourage.

422
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:02,484
Jim, Dwight, Ryan.

423
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,085
Come on, we're going
to Asian Hooters.

424
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:05,553
Oh, man, I can't.

425
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:07,422
- Why not?
- I'm not feeling so well.

426
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:08,656
I got a ton of work to do here.

427
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,225
MSG allergy, peanut allergy.

428
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:11,593
I just ate there last night.

429
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:14,129
Okay.
Feel better.

430
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:15,196
Thanks.

431
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:16,397
Come on, Jim.
Let's go.

432
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,032
Okay.

433
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:20,468
Wow... thanks for taking
all the excuses, dude.

434
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,470
Doctor appointment,
car trouble, plantar warts,

435
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:24,005
granddad fought in WWII.

436
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,707
Use your head, man.
I keep mine in here.

437
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,877
Look alive, Halpert.
Welcome back.

438
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:30,912
Bros before hoes!
Why?

439
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:33,148
Because your bros
are always there for you.

440
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,883
They have got your back

441
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:36,985
after your ho
rips your heart out

442
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:38,520
for no good reason.

443
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:41,356
And you were nothing
but great to your ho,

444
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:44,125
and you told her that she was
the only ho for you,

445
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:47,629
and that she was better than all
the other hoes in the world.

446
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,430
And then...

447
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:55,703
then suddenly,
she's not your ho no mo'.

448
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:03,011
So...
she looks really hot.

449
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:04,445
So I said,

450
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:06,548
"You look hotter
than usual today."

451
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,149
Thank you.

452
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:10,385
Michael.

453
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:12,253
Head of the table.

454
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:14,122
Just get in right there.
Good.

455
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:16,424
Jim.

456
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,926
Actually, um...

457
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:19,828
Excuse me, sir, I'm gonna
need to take this chair.

458
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,095
- Dwight, just leave them...
- So...

459
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:22,096
Leave them alone.

460
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:23,731
Please.
They're on a date.

461
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,433
They look very happy.

462
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:28,336
So she looks at me, right?

463
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:33,074
And she goes, "I'm sorry,
do I even know you?"

464
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:34,342
After a year.

465
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:35,944
A year of buying
lattes from her.

466
00:18:35,946 --> 00:18:37,579
- Do you believe that?
- Yes.

467
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:38,713
I can't, uh,

468
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:40,348
I can't hear what you're saying!

469
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,016
Carol used to drink lattes.

470
00:18:42,018 --> 00:18:43,084
Who are you talking about?

471
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:45,420
She would get this little
foam mustache.

472
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:46,754
Carol had a mustache?

473
00:18:46,756 --> 00:18:48,790
And I used to say,
"Hey, got latte?"

474
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,825
And she'd say,
"That's not funny."

475
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:51,926
What are you guys talking about?

476
00:18:51,928 --> 00:18:53,127
She totally got me.

477
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,330
She understood...

478
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:57,799
that we didn't have to laugh

479
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,701
- Michael!
- to enjoy each other.

480
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:01,069
Repeat what you said, louder.

481
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:03,671
It is my job
to be there for Michael.

482
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,673
How can I be there for Michael

483
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:07,308
if I'm here for Michael?

484
00:19:11,213 --> 00:19:14,349
I'm already starting to forget
what color eyes she had.

485
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:17,118
I can't... okay.
I'm gonna call her.

486
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,187
- I am going to call and find out...
- No!

487
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:20,255
Who are you calling?

488
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:22,123
- Put it away.
- I'm gonna call her.

489
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,692
Put that away.
SOS... we... hi.

490
00:19:24,694 --> 00:19:26,261
Mayday.

491
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:29,163
Man down over here.
We need your help.

492
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,665
What can I get for ya?

493
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:35,003
I think we'll start with
a round of Nog-a-sakes.

494
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:38,273
One part eggnog.
Three parts sake!

495
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:40,441
Some places won't
make it for you, though,

496
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:43,077
because eggnog is seasonal.

497
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:47,782
You should put out salt
for the rims.

498
00:19:47,784 --> 00:19:49,851
That's a great idea.

499
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,452
Phyllis?

500
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:53,888
I was just getting a snack.

501
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,623
You can have your snack in here.

502
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,292
Pam, don't tell her what to do.

503
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,293
Phyllis...

504
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,028
Oh... okay.

505
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:07,669
I think I'll go
to Angela's party

506
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:10,171
because that's the party I know.

507
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,707
I miss the days when
there was only one party

508
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,275
I didn't want to go to.

509
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,478
So I only use three?

510
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,847
If you're using more
than three pieces of tape

511
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:21,916
to wrap a present,
you're doing it wrong.

512
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:24,152
Okay, and where'd you get
all those cool bows?

513
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:27,221
Oh, I just get those
at any party supply place.

514
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:29,924
Okay.

515
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,426
Are you sure I can't use, like,

516
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:32,994
the cartoons from the newspaper?

517
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:35,330
Oh, yeah, your mom
would love that.

518
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,067
Hey.
Hey.

519
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,969
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

520
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:42,837
Bye.

521
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,572
He's cute.

522
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:45,807
You should date him.

523
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,108
Oh...

524
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,876
Yeah, maybe.

525
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:54,248
Looks like you got

526
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,951
a little nakiri
knife action going there.

527
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:58,353
No, it's usuba.

528
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:01,389
Yeah, I bet you wish
you had a nakiri, though.

529
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:03,558
Actually, the usuba's
the better knife

530
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,426
when you're working
with this quantity.

531
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:07,261
Eh, I don't know.

532
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:08,930
Still think nakiri's better.

533
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:11,499
I think he'd know.

534
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:16,838
Nothing he's doing
is cheering me up.

535
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,507
Wait for the onion.
Trust me.

536
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,746
Hey, Cindy.

537
00:21:24,748 --> 00:21:26,047
He just had his heart broken.

538
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:27,448
You wouldn't do that
to him, would you?

539
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,683
I don't know.

540
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:30,051
Oh, sure you would.
Look at you.

541
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,787
I bet you break up
with a guy every hour.

542
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:36,057
You made her laugh!

543
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,659
Yes!
She totally digs us.

544
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:40,728
Watch, watch.

545
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,499
Huh? Huh?

546
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,868
What did I tell you?

547
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,503
You're right.
That's good.

548
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,942
Hello, everyone.

549
00:21:54,944 --> 00:21:56,844
We would just like to announce

550
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:58,012
that our party is starting now

551
00:21:58,014 --> 00:21:59,914
in the break room, so...

552
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:00,982
I have a very important

553
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:03,051
announcement to make.

554
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:04,886
About...

555
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,354
your paychecks.

556
00:22:06,356 --> 00:22:09,157
Um... your paychecks
will be arriving

557
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:12,493
as scheduled on Friday.

558
00:22:12,495 --> 00:22:14,595
And they will be
in the correct amount

559
00:22:14,597 --> 00:22:15,997
that they normally are in.

560
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:22,036
Please stand by for a very
important announcement

561
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:23,604
further regarding your paycheck!

562
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,843
I need to know
if I can start the party.

563
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:32,413
Michael!

564
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,815
Hey!

565
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:34,882
Over here, Michael!

566
00:22:38,455 --> 00:22:41,022
I don't know.
No one can hear me.

567
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:43,124
You know what?
Start the party.

568
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:45,359
Did Michael give you permission
to do this?

569
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:48,896
Start the party.

570
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,101
Also, I would like to inform you

571
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:54,535
that, um,

572
00:22:54,537 --> 00:22:57,271
as a special treat,
my party will be starting early.

573
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:58,673
In fact, it will be starting...

574
00:22:58,675 --> 00:23:00,174
right now.

575
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:03,077
- Our party is also starting now.
- Yep.

576
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,071
- All right, Stanley.
- Good choice.

577
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:31,272
Woo!

578
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:37,245
Welcome, Hannah.
You will not be disappointed.

579
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:38,646
Why would I be disappointed?

580
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:39,947
I said you wouldn't
be disappointed.

581
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:45,953
Meredith, if you don't
come to my party,

582
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:48,723
you will be very, very sorry.

583
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,591
Is that a threat?

584
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:53,327
No, it's an invitation.

585
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:55,096
- We have vodka!
- Lots of it.

586
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:04,472
I hear Angela's party will
have double fudge brownies.

587
00:24:04,474 --> 00:24:06,807
But it will also have Angela.

588
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:11,212
So, double fudge.
Angela.

589
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:16,517
Double fudge... Angela.

590
00:24:18,053 --> 00:24:20,421
Hmm...

591
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:24,258
Brownies.

592
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,993
Cupcakes.

593
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,295
Don't push it.

594
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:39,941
Are we taking this too far?
You know what?

595
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:43,177
I don't think we're
taking this far enough.

596
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:45,012
What?

597
00:24:45,014 --> 00:24:47,315
I got goose bumps.

598
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,451
I don't back down.

599
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:52,820
My sister and I used to be
best friends,

600
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:55,089
and we haven't talked
in 16 years

601
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:57,692
over some disagreement
I don't even remember.

602
00:24:57,694 --> 00:25:02,463
So... yeah,
I'm pretty good.

603
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:07,001
Oh!
Damn, this chicken is good.

604
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:09,737
My compliments to the chef.

605
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:11,239
Which is you!

606
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:12,540
Right?

607
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:15,343
Awesome!

608
00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:16,811
I need some meat.

609
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:18,779
I want some steak.

610
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:21,282
That guy's got steak.

611
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:24,619
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

612
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:26,754
En garde!

613
00:25:26,756 --> 00:25:29,423
It's family style.

614
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:30,891
No, it's not.

615
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:32,760
Oh, God.
Cindy!

616
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:34,161
- Cindy!
- I love steak.

617
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:36,697
I love it!

618
00:25:36,699 --> 00:25:39,400
I want you to close your eyes

619
00:25:39,402 --> 00:25:41,802
and imagine your dream house.

620
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:45,373
Come on!

621
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,609
Do it for Michael.
He's had a really long day.

622
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:49,910
What are you doing?

623
00:25:49,912 --> 00:25:51,412
This is great.

624
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:53,180
Jim! Jim!

625
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:58,586
What... what's happening?

626
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:01,622
Oh, she's asleep.

627
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:03,791
Oh, narcolepsy.

628
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:05,126
Probably.

629
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:07,695
Okay, now open your eyes

630
00:26:07,697 --> 00:26:10,164
and describe it to me.

631
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,800
I don't know.

632
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,735
It has four bedrooms and a loft.

633
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:16,704
- Oh, my God. Now she's up.
- Yeah?

634
00:26:16,706 --> 00:26:17,972
And she's trying to describe

635
00:26:17,974 --> 00:26:19,874
how to correctly
butcher a goose,

636
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:21,709
but she's having trouble
coming up with it.

637
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,277
Okay.
Cindy!

638
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,845
Yo, Cindy, Cindy.

639
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:26,914
Hold its neck back,

640
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:28,749
insert the knife
beneath the jaw,

641
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:30,551
bring it all the way around.

642
00:26:30,553 --> 00:26:32,653
There's gonna be
a good amount of blood.

643
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:34,955
Have a bucket there
for the blood

644
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:37,158
and the innards
and the feathers.

645
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:40,294
Oh, no, this is different.

646
00:26:40,296 --> 00:26:42,630
The CIA thing, that was
a prank on Dwight.

647
00:26:42,632 --> 00:26:46,734
This is more like a, um...

648
00:26:46,736 --> 00:26:48,402
Okay, it's pretty much
the same thing.

649
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:04,685
What do you think?

650
00:27:04,687 --> 00:27:06,320
Fruity and delicious.

651
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:07,955
See, I told you.
You want one, Meredith?

652
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:11,192
No thanks.
They're too sweet.

653
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,627
Hey, so what's the status?

654
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:15,029
Looks like they forgot
the power cord.

655
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:16,597
- What?
- Oh, you're kidding me.

656
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,733
- No.
- Oh, God.

657
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:19,734
You guys, guys.

658
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:21,335
I'm sorry,

659
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:23,137
but there's a problem
with the karaoke machine.

660
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:25,573
Well, that blows.

661
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:27,441
Hang on, little ladies.
You don't need this thing.

662
00:27:27,443 --> 00:27:29,510
I'll go grab my synthesizer.

663
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:34,181
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

664
00:27:34,183 --> 00:27:36,517
Darryl! Darryl!

665
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:40,254
Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!

666
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:42,690
- Hi.
- Hey.

667
00:27:42,692 --> 00:27:45,459
Hey, look when you get done
with your... meeting

668
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:46,527
you should come
to the break room.

669
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:47,561
We're having a party.

670
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:50,231
- Oh, okay.
- All right? See you later.

671
00:27:55,637 --> 00:27:58,205
These nuts are really
hard to crack.

672
00:27:58,207 --> 00:28:00,241
Try harder then.

673
00:28:05,013 --> 00:28:08,916
Uh-uh, no one has seconds
until everyone's had some.

674
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:10,684
You've got to be kidding.

675
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:12,920
You've got to be kidding.

676
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:22,296
Cold, huh?

677
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:23,497
Yeah.

678
00:28:23,499 --> 00:28:24,899
That'll help.

679
00:28:28,036 --> 00:28:29,770
Is it cold in there?

680
00:28:29,772 --> 00:28:33,741
They have been checking us
out all night.

681
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:35,209
I am not kidding!

682
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:37,978
We should invite them
to the Christmas party.

683
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,281
Now you are thinking.
Yes!

684
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:41,949
And you know what?

685
00:28:41,951 --> 00:28:44,118
Because you have had
such a rough day,

686
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,920
you get Cindy.

687
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:49,790
Oh, you are such
a mensch, my friend.

688
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:57,598
Okay, where is everybody?

689
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,935
I would like them to meet
my new girlfriend.

690
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:03,170
I'm sure they'll want
to meet her too.

691
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,641
The least I could do

692
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:11,145
was give some poor
sick kid a bike.

693
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:12,313
That rocks.

694
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:14,281
Yeah, you rock.

695
00:29:14,283 --> 00:29:16,083
Tell you what.
If you want it, it's yours.

696
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:17,751
Thanks!

697
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,056
I want to give you something.

698
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:24,592
Oh.

699
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:28,596
That's what she said?

700
00:29:28,598 --> 00:29:29,964
Hello!

701
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,465
I would like everybody to meet

702
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:32,700
my new girlfriend.

703
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,335
And my new girlfriend.

704
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:35,903
Where's Dwight?

705
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:37,671
Is he the hot one
or the giant baby?

706
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:39,673
The giant baby.

707
00:29:39,675 --> 00:29:41,242
Wow, I am so sorry.

708
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:44,044
I had no idea
this party'd be so lame.

709
00:29:44,046 --> 00:29:45,813
There's another party
in the break room.

710
00:29:45,815 --> 00:29:47,147
Oh, party in the break room.

711
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:49,016
Let's go, let's go.
Thank God.

712
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:50,317
Let's go to the break room.

713
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,553
Hey, excuse me!
Waitress lady, hey!

714
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:53,687
Where do you think
you're going with that?

715
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:54,989
I thought I could have it.

716
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:57,057
You can't have it.

717
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,225
I don't walk into your house

718
00:29:58,227 --> 00:29:59,593
and steal your
Hello Kitty backpack.

719
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:01,095
Ssshut it!

720
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:02,763
Come on, party.

721
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:04,565
Hey, it's Angela!

722
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,851
I just think that
there are two...

723
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:26,587
two specific kinds of
people in the world.

724
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:31,425
People who own houses
and people who own condos.

725
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:34,361
All right?

726
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:37,398
And my question to you

727
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,200
is do you agree?

728
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:41,802
Do I agree about what?

729
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:43,537
Do you agree about what?

730
00:30:46,075 --> 00:30:47,942
Wow!

731
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:50,077
You're lucky
you're so darn cute.

732
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,012
What are you talking about? Huh?

733
00:30:52,014 --> 00:30:53,347
What are you talking about?

734
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:17,771
Way to go, Kev.
Good work.

735
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:30,484
Did you have fun at Benihana's?

736
00:31:30,486 --> 00:31:32,353
No, it was awful.

737
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:34,221
I couldn't hear anything.

738
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,060
I've had the worst day here.

739
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:50,104
Dwight, you won the raffle.

740
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:53,040
No way! Yeah!

741
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,241
Open it, open it!

742
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:00,114
- Do you like it?
- Walkie-talkies!

743
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:01,548
Can I talk to you a sec?

744
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,083
Yes!

745
00:32:03,085 --> 00:32:06,687
Well, the Committee to Plan
Parties has served its purpose.

746
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:11,291
We're gonna disband
in the name of Christmas.

747
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:13,360
In the name of
Nutcracker Christmas.

748
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:20,300
Angela, we've been hearing
really great things

749
00:32:20,302 --> 00:32:21,935
about your brownies.

750
00:32:21,937 --> 00:32:23,971
And we were hoping
you'd consider

751
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:25,539
merging the two parties.

752
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:27,608
I'm not sure.

753
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:34,148
Does your karaoke machine
have Christmas songs?

754
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,050
Yeah, but we don't
have a power cord.

755
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:39,853
Oh, I may have
seen it somewhere.

756
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:47,327
Is it this one?

757
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:49,329
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

758
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:51,899
Thanks.

759
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,367
We'll go tell everyone.

760
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:55,436
Okay.

761
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:54,762
When you know, you just know.

762
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:56,163
Right?

763
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:57,164
Right.

764
00:33:57,166 --> 00:33:58,999
Check her out.

765
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,168
My little gal over there?
Babe-a-lectible.

766
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,936
Which one is she?

767
00:34:05,974 --> 00:34:09,243
It's one of those two.

768
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:10,444
You don't know?

769
00:34:10,446 --> 00:34:11,845
Dude, you should know.

770
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:14,281
Yeah, well, it's been hard.

771
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:16,817
They're wearing
the exact same uniform.

772
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:19,019
And I've been drinking.

773
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:22,122
And you know how all...

774
00:34:22,124 --> 00:34:23,991
waitresses look alike.

775
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:29,329
I honestly don't see
what the big deal is.

776
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:30,898
Stevie Wonder is married.

777
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,067
Are you going to tell me
that Steve Wonder

778
00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:36,904
doesn't love his wife just
because he's not sure

779
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:38,138
what she looks like?

780
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,907
Hey!

781
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,910
Where's my girl?

782
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:45,946
Is she in the fridge?

783
00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:48,315
Where is she hiding?

784
00:34:48,317 --> 00:34:52,219
I don't know where she is.

785
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:53,987
Oh, 'cause I'm drunk.

786
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:56,557
I can't even find her.
Argh-argh!

787
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,927
You know where I am.
I do!

788
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:01,695
Hi!

789
00:35:01,697 --> 00:35:03,964
I just haven't
hugged you in a while.

790
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:06,066
Mmm!

791
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:07,367
Good.
That felt good.

792
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:09,436
Let's go party.

793
00:35:35,464 --> 00:35:38,232
Monkey, this is Possum.
Do you copy?

794
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,033
Copy, Possum.
What's your 20?

795
00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:42,870
No way!

796
00:35:42,872 --> 00:35:45,539
What a horrible,
horrible movie that was.

797
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:47,307
And now I get to
remember it forever.

798
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:50,811
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

799
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,317
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey you!

800
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,353
How are you?

801
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:02,389
This party blows,
so we're gonna leave.

802
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:03,924
No, no, no.

803
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:06,827
Hey, you should stay
because we're having fun.

804
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:09,630
And... where do you
want to go?

805
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:11,665
I... we're just gonna
take off.

806
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:15,335
You know what?
I... okay, listen.

807
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:16,770
I like you.

808
00:36:16,772 --> 00:36:18,438
I really like you.

809
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,774
So much, in fact, that

810
00:36:20,776 --> 00:36:22,943
I would like you to accompany me

811
00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:26,980
on a trip to Sandals Jamaica.

812
00:36:26,982 --> 00:36:30,350
No, I have school.

813
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,327
You want help?
Okay.

814
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:41,995
Merry Christmas!

815
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:44,064
Merry Christmas.

816
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:10,424
That waitress was the one.

817
00:37:10,426 --> 00:37:12,893
No, she wasn't.

818
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:14,761
How can you be sure?

819
00:37:14,763 --> 00:37:16,163
Well, for starters,

820
00:37:16,165 --> 00:37:17,397
I've known you as a couple

821
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,765
since the beginning
of the relationship,

822
00:37:18,767 --> 00:37:21,301
which was approximately
three hours ago.

823
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:25,238
Don't make fun of me.
You're making fun of me.

824
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,974
Sorry.

825
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:34,047
I guess I didn't
know her very well.

826
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:38,986
I marked her arm.

827
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:40,520
You what?

828
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:45,325
I... I put a mark
on her arm.

829
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:51,765
So I could tell 'em apart.

830
00:37:51,767 --> 00:37:55,235
I don't...
I know, I know.

831
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,072
I can't believe
I gave her my bike.

832
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:02,075
Yeah.

833
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:06,380
Why do I feel like crap?

834
00:38:06,382 --> 00:38:09,816
You just had a rebound.

835
00:38:09,818 --> 00:38:12,252
Had a rebound.

836
00:38:12,254 --> 00:38:14,187
Yeah.

837
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:15,789
Which, don't get me wrong,

838
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,525
can be a really fun distraction.

839
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:21,628
But when it's over,

840
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,297
you're left thinking about
the girl you really like.

841
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,433
The one that broke your heart.

842
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:33,507
I totally rebounded.

843
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:35,075
Someone else shoots,

844
00:38:35,077 --> 00:38:37,044
and I take the ball and I score.

845
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:38,779
Well, I guess I didn't
really score.

846
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:41,848
And I'm not sure who is
actually shooting,

847
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,017
but... whatever.

848
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:45,085
Doesn't matter.

849
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:47,120
It's all good.

850
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:48,622
Or as my ex might say,

851
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:55,162
"Domo arigato,
Mr. Scott-o."

852
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:25,592
Um, yes, I just wanted to see

853
00:39:25,594 --> 00:39:29,596
if you would like to come
to Jamaica with me.

854
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:33,333
There's this resort
called Sandals.

855
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,905
Really?

856
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:41,441
Okay.
All right.

857
00:39:41,443 --> 00:39:43,477
I promise you won't be
disappointed.

858
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:46,680
Um, it's all-inclusive.

859
00:39:51,854 --> 00:39:53,019
Too soon.

860
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:17,611
- Night, Pam.
- Night.

861
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:21,414
Oh, you know what?

862
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,650
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

863
00:40:23,652 --> 00:40:25,652
I intercepted
a transmission earlier,

864
00:40:25,654 --> 00:40:28,455
and it seems that the CIA is
gonna need Dwight

865
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:30,524
down at their headquarters
at Langley for training

866
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:33,927
and an ice cream social
with the other agents.

867
00:40:35,997 --> 00:40:37,731
We should get him a bus ticket.

868
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:38,965
To make his trip easier.

869
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:40,667
Oh, no, that would be
very patriotic.

870
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,371
It costs $75.

871
00:40:44,373 --> 00:40:46,673
Hmm.

872
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:49,476
Well, maybe the CIA
could send a helicopter.

873
00:40:49,478 --> 00:40:51,344
Oh!

874
00:40:57,818 --> 00:40:59,819
What the...

875
00:41:02,924 --> 00:41:04,791
"You have been compromised.

876
00:41:04,793 --> 00:41:07,327
Abort mission.
Destroy phone."

877
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:09,896
Destroy phone.
