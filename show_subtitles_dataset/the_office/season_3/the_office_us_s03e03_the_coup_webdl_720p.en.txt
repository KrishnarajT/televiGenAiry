1
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:05,881
I'm hungry.

2
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,653
Mooovie Monday!

3
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:15,324
The only cure I know
for the Monday blues is...

4
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:17,960
Varsity Blues.

5
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:19,462
Let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

6
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:21,330
Take a seat down there.
Second from the end.

7
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:23,232
All right, everybody here?

8
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:24,233
Yes.

9
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:25,735
Popcorn, anyone?

10
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,403
Yes, please!

11
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:28,904
Thank you.

12
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:32,008
Anyone else?

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,143
No.

14
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:36,412
Movie Monday started
with training videos.

15
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:38,347
But we went through those
pretty fast.

16
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:42,084
Then we watched a medical video.

17
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:43,686
Since then, it's been
half hour installments

18
00:00:43,688 --> 00:00:46,188
of various movies.

19
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,624
With the exception of
an episode of Entourage,

20
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:50,359
which Michael made us watch
six times.

21
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:53,929
Entourage!

22
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,931
Kevin, would you like to do
the scenes from last week?

23
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:30,266
Yes.

24
00:01:30,268 --> 00:01:31,434
Why him?

25
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:33,335
Don't whine.
Get the windows.

26
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:36,038
Previously on Varsity Blues...

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,941
Okay, Billy Bob
got a head injury,

28
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:40,643
but coach made him play.

29
00:01:40,645 --> 00:01:43,512
So then Lance, he gets sacked.

30
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:44,947
And he's out for the year.

31
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:53,255
Hello?

32
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:56,325
Not everyone approves
of movie Monday.

33
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:57,860
I won't say who.

34
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:00,696
I don't approve.
I don't.

35
00:02:00,698 --> 00:02:03,365
Hello?

36
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:10,406
Let's go after that title now.

37
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:13,776
Let's go, let's go!
Let's go!

38
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:17,780
Hi, Jan!

39
00:02:17,782 --> 00:02:19,215
Hope you brought the Milk Duds.

40
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:20,850
How would a movie

41
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:22,451
increase productivity, Michael?

42
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:25,387
How, on earth, would it do that?

43
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:27,156
People work faster after.

44
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:28,224
Magically.

45
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:29,859
No.

46
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:32,561
They have to,
to make up for the time...

47
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:33,562
watching the movie.

48
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:35,064
No.

49
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,799
Do I need to hire
a babysitter for you...

50
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:38,167
Kitchen.

51
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,301
Some little 14-year-old girl

52
00:02:39,303 --> 00:02:40,970
whose job it is...

53
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,838
Michael is going to
get us all fired.

54
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,740
You sat back and let him
play that dumb movie

55
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:45,975
and now Jan is peeved off.

56
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:47,576
And we're all
going to lose our jobs.

57
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:49,245
That's not going to happen.

58
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:51,380
You know she has it
out for him now.

59
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:52,715
That's not his fault.

60
00:02:52,717 --> 00:02:54,083
He had to follow his heart.

61
00:02:54,085 --> 00:02:56,452
Ever since Michael
dumped Jan for Carol,

62
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:58,420
Jan's been bitching out on him.

63
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:01,290
Reject a woman and she will
never let it go.

64
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,492
One of the many defects
of their kind.

65
00:03:03,494 --> 00:03:04,860
Also, weak arms.

66
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:08,664
Dwight, you should be
running this office.

67
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,069
Michael would never let me.

68
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:15,404
It's not up to Michael.

69
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:16,739
It's Jan's call.
Talk to her.

70
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,073
I could never do that.

71
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:19,308
Fine, sit back and do nothing

72
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,310
and let us all get fired.

73
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,684
I know that patience
and loyalty are good

74
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,319
and virtuous traits.

75
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:33,556
But sometimes I just think
you need to grow a pair.

76
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:36,425
At the Stanford branch,
they all play

77
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:39,395
this World War II video game
called Call of Duty.

78
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:41,897
And they're all really into it.

79
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:44,767
I'm told it started
as a team building exercise.

80
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,836
Unfortunately,
I really suck at it.

81
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,370
Oh.

82
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:51,240
We didn't play
many video games in Scranton.

83
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,576
Instead we'd do stuff like...

84
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:56,245
Uh, Pam and I would sometimes
hum the same

85
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:57,613
high pitched note.

86
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:59,381
And try to get Dwight
to make an appointment

87
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:01,951
with an ear doctor.

88
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:05,354
And Pam called it...

89
00:04:05,356 --> 00:04:07,122
Pretendonitis.

90
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:09,491
Hey, Kelly,
my stuff just got here.

91
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:14,230
Kelly really likes
to online shop.

92
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:18,100
So I felt like I wanted
some new clothes.

93
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:20,302
I mean, I just...

94
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:22,304
I wanted to...

95
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:26,675
I felt like it was time
to maybe, um...

96
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:28,210
just get new clothes.

97
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,413
Okay.

98
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:33,182
I love it.

99
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:34,783
Really?
I don't know.

100
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:36,252
Now, you haven't even
tried it on yet.

101
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:37,553
Try it on.

102
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:38,854
Not at work.
I'll try it on...

103
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:40,489
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

104
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:41,957
Fashion show at lunch!

105
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:45,060
No.

106
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,362
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

107
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:48,430
Fashion show at lunch!

108
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:49,765
Fashion show!
Fashion show!

109
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,200
Fashion show at lunch!

110
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:55,504
Why did you do that?

111
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:57,940
I'm just killing Germans
any way I can.

112
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:00,342
We're on the German team.

113
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:04,280
Shoot the British.

114
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:05,848
Wait, are we playing teams?

115
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,917
Yeah.

116
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,252
Wah!

117
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,721
Gah!

118
00:05:21,798 --> 00:05:23,265
Hello?

119
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,867
Is this Jan?

120
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:25,868
Who is this?

121
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,038
This is Dwight Schrute.

122
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,373
I am calling about
an extremely sensitive matter.

123
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,375
You should talk to Michael
and he'll talk to me

124
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:35,744
and that way we don't have
to speak to each other.

125
00:05:35,746 --> 00:05:37,279
It's about Michael.

126
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:39,815
What about him?

127
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:42,952
I can't talk here.
It's too sensitive.

128
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:45,287
It's not about
a surprise party, is it?

129
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:47,356
No, but we should discuss that
another time.

130
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:50,025
Look, I'm already an hour
outside of Scranton, Dwight.

131
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:51,660
I am not coming back.

132
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:53,662
Pull over at exit 40.

133
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:57,633
There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.

134
00:05:57,635 --> 00:05:59,435
I know you like that store.

135
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:02,705
Go inside and shop
until I can meet you.

136
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:04,707
How do you know
I like that store?

137
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,442
Many of your blouses
are Claibornes.

138
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:08,010
How do you know that?

139
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:09,745
It's part of my job.

140
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,982
No, it's not.
It's officially not.

141
00:06:13,483 --> 00:06:14,683
Noted.

142
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:18,220
I'm going to the dentist.

143
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:20,990
Okay.

144
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:22,891
I have to have
an emergency crown put in.

145
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:24,326
Ouchy.

146
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:26,595
Yes.

147
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:29,832
It's a new dentist.
He's far.

148
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:33,769
I might be gone three hours.

149
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:34,937
Three hours, wow.

150
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,672
Have fun.

151
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:44,013
Did you get anything good?

152
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:45,714
Yeah.

153
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:48,083
New blouse?

154
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:52,621
Halter top?
Camisole?

155
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:53,822
Teddy?

156
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:54,957
I could save the branch.

157
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,025
Really.

158
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:58,627
If you let me run it.

159
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:59,828
Okay.

160
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,030
Okay, I can run it?

161
00:07:01,032 --> 00:07:04,600
What would you do differently?

162
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:05,934
Mostly get rid of waste.

163
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:08,604
Which is half the people there.

164
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:10,672
And clean house.

165
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:13,108
Right here.
It's all for me.

166
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,510
Thank you.

167
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,912
Dwight, you just feel strongly
to speak with me this way

168
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:18,480
behind Michael's back.

169
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:20,582
And turn on so many
of your co-workers.

170
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,453
The decision to turn on Michael
was difficult.

171
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:27,022
But once I did it,
I didn't look back.

172
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:29,625
And mostly I feel that
Michael would approve.

173
00:07:29,627 --> 00:07:34,663
It's really what's best
for the branch.

174
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:37,099
And I could care less
about my co-workers.

175
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:40,602
So, here we are.

176
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:44,206
It's all on the table.

177
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:47,109
I want the branch.

178
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:51,880
And I await your decision.

179
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:57,586
Oh, by the way...

180
00:07:57,588 --> 00:08:00,422
There's a new Ann Taylor
outlet store near here.

181
00:08:00,424 --> 00:08:02,724
I know you like their earrings.

182
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:07,062
Where is it?

183
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:08,464
Michael.
Hi.

184
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:10,232
I've had a very interesting
conversation

185
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:11,366
with one of your employees.

186
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,501
Oh, that's nice.

187
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:13,836
No, it wasn't.

188
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:15,270
Dwight just told me
that he thinks

189
00:08:15,272 --> 00:08:17,306
he can run the branch
better than you.

190
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:19,641
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

191
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:20,943
You were at the dentist?

192
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:22,311
You can't have people
undermining you.

193
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:23,512
Get control of your branch
immediately.

194
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:24,513
Okay.

195
00:08:24,515 --> 00:08:25,747
What was Dwight thinking?

196
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:27,983
That he could turn Jan
against me?

197
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:30,652
She's my ex-lover... ish.

198
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,357
Wow.

199
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,525
It's so sexy.

200
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:37,593
You look so hot.

201
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:39,428
It's really something.

202
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,562
It's too much.

203
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:42,064
- What?
- I'm gonna return it.

204
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:43,699
No, you have to keep it today.

205
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,034
Just see how you feel.

206
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:47,402
Hey.

207
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:48,470
Hi.

208
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:50,305
You look nice.

209
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:52,908
Thanks.

210
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,110
Isn't that, like,
your third soda today?

211
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,549
Yeah, I think we can be
a big help to your company.

212
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:04,386
Okay, see you next week.
Bye.

213
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:06,488
Again?

214
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,589
Scared?

215
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:09,158
Call of Duty!

216
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:13,996
Andy, Jim, can I see you
in the conference room

217
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:15,664
- for a minute?
- Now?

218
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,665
Yes, now.

219
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,666
Put the game on hold, everyone.

220
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:19,067
This is not working, okay?

221
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,569
We are getting slaughtered
out there.

222
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:22,738
It's the new guy.

223
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,039
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't know...

224
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,040
what we're talking about.

225
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,275
See what I mean?

226
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:27,476
We just need a strategy, okay?

227
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:29,645
We're gonna set up a trap
in the gun room.

228
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,446
All right, Jim,
are you using the MP-40

229
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:32,881
or the 44?

230
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:33,949
Um, sniper rifle?

231
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,417
Snipe...
What?

232
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:37,219
Are you playing for
the other team?

233
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:39,154
You don't snipe
in Carrington, okay?

234
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:40,989
Saboteur!

235
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:42,124
Saboteur!

236
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:45,160
I'm gonna kill you for real.

237
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,495
The game is over.

238
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,530
I'm really going to shoot you.

239
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,910
Hey, Dwight...
Hey.

240
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:03,278
You want an m&m?

241
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,581
No, thanks, I'm stuffed.
No, seriously.

242
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,317
You should have an m&m.
They're really good.

243
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:12,688
Okay.

244
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:21,063
Good, huh?

245
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:24,666
So good.

246
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,573
Hey, I thought you weren't
supposed to eat anything

247
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:33,542
for a couple of hours
after you've had

248
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:35,277
a crown put in.

249
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:42,050
They have this new kind of
quick drying bonding.

250
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:43,151
So...

251
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:44,286
Sounds like a good dentist.

252
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:45,654
Oh, yeah.

253
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:48,457
What's his name?

254
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:55,897
Crentist.

255
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,002
Your dentist's name is Crentist.

256
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:04,206
Huh.

257
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,907
Sounds a lot like dentist.

258
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:10,512
Maybe that's why
he became a dentist.

259
00:11:13,116 --> 00:11:14,983
Let me see your teeth.

260
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:17,686
Let me see 'em.

261
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:20,756
Let me see 'em.

262
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,261
Ohh.

263
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,434
You should floss.

264
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:35,937
I know.

265
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:38,840
Well then.

266
00:11:42,712 --> 00:11:47,416
I'm glad you're okay.

267
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:49,318
Business is like a jungle.

268
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,754
And I am like a tiger.

269
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:56,658
And Dwight is like a monkey...

270
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,495
that stabs a tiger
in the back with a stick.

271
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:03,432
Does the tiger fire the monkey?

272
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:06,435
Does the tiger
transfer the monkey

273
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:09,338
to another branch?

274
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,541
Pun.

275
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:15,577
There is no way
of knowing what goes on

276
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:18,347
inside the tiger's head.

277
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,514
We don't have the technology.

278
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:25,887
Dwight, can I talk to you
for a second?

279
00:12:32,563 --> 00:12:35,197
Wow, this is tough!

280
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,565
Brrrrr!

281
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,100
What?

282
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:41,269
Oh.

283
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:42,971
Aaaarg!

284
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:44,206
What is it?

285
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:48,143
Well...

286
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:50,345
I just got off the phone
with Jan.

287
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:53,081
And, um...

288
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:57,919
She demoted me.

289
00:12:57,921 --> 00:13:00,188
No.

290
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,390
Yeah.

291
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:03,191
You know what the craziest
part of this is?

292
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:04,826
She demoted me to your job.

293
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:09,097
And she said that you
should be expecting

294
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,265
a call later from corporate.

295
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,401
And that, um...

296
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:15,303
I guess that means
that you are going to be

297
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:17,172
acting manager
of Dunder-Mifflin Scranton.

298
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:19,241
I can't believe this news.

299
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:22,210
That... wow.

300
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:24,846
Yeah.

301
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:27,215
I told her I didn't know
whether you'd wanna do it.

302
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:29,584
Because you've always been
so loyal to me.

303
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:32,754
You've been my most
trusted ally.

304
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:36,024
You said that?

305
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:38,760
Yep, I did.

306
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:41,296
I did.

307
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,834
But I think...

308
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:48,470
you should do it.

309
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:52,140
Well...

310
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:54,810
Gosh, if you think I should.

311
00:13:54,812 --> 00:13:56,311
Then I will.

312
00:14:01,117 --> 00:14:02,984
Perfect.
Well, we're settled.

313
00:14:02,986 --> 00:14:05,053
All right.
All right.

314
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,189
Well, then you are now
acting manager

315
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:09,558
of Dunder-Mifflin
Scranton branch.

316
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,494
And I am assistant
regional manager.

317
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:13,762
Assistant to
the regional manager.

318
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:15,664
Thank you, Michael,
for staying on.

319
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,698
I really appreciate it.

320
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,201
Hey, hey.

321
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,670
I can't imagine this place
without you.

322
00:14:21,672 --> 00:14:24,873
Can you?

323
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,876
That's so nice.

324
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,647
Well, um...

325
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:34,282
I guess we should
go tell the troops.

326
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:38,220
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.

327
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:40,121
Okay, let's do it.

328
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:45,861
Hey. Hi, hello.

329
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:48,230
Everybody, I have
some good news.

330
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:50,065
And I have some bad news.

331
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:54,936
I am being replaced
as your leader by Dwight.

332
00:14:54,938 --> 00:14:56,571
You're kidding.

333
00:14:56,573 --> 00:14:58,173
You might think
that I am kidding

334
00:14:58,175 --> 00:14:59,941
and I understand that.

335
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:01,076
Congratulations, Dwight.

336
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,144
Thank you, Angela.

337
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:04,579
But why Dwight?

338
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:09,317
Because Dwight never lies.

339
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:10,785
How does that qualify him
to run a branch?

340
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:12,420
Because that's all it takes.

341
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:14,623
Okay, Dwight, would you like to

342
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,959
say a few words
to everybody about loyalty?

343
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:19,794
Thank you, Michael.

344
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:22,063
I just wanna say
to the few of you

345
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:23,465
who will remain under my employ,

346
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:26,735
that I intend to lead you
into the black

347
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:28,670
with ferocity.

348
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:30,539
Michael, what will you do?

349
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,573
Oh, I'll be fine.

350
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:33,141
Do you have any savings?

351
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:34,576
No, no, I don't.

352
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:35,977
Michael, you might
lose your condo.

353
00:15:35,979 --> 00:15:37,078
I won't.

354
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,113
I won't.

355
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:40,282
I have this
little vacuum cleaner

356
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:41,449
that's broken.

357
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,450
If Dwight doesn't work out,

358
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:44,019
maybe that could be manager.

359
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:45,687
Maybe I'll quit.

360
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,389
It's really happening.

361
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:49,124
Yes.

362
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,995
We can make a difference here.

363
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:58,266
I will make a difference here.

364
00:15:58,268 --> 00:15:59,734
You alone?

365
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:01,069
'Cause I thought together...

366
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:02,737
Oh, please, don't be naive.

367
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:08,076
You can be in charge
of the women.

368
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,619
Look how cute he is.

369
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,888
And he's trying to shoot
with a smoke grenade.

370
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,823
I'm sorry, what are you
whispering back there?

371
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,825
Nothing, just concentrate
on turning around.

372
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:24,960
I'm trying.

373
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:26,127
I just...

374
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:27,295
Just tap S then D.

375
00:16:27,297 --> 00:16:28,897
Oh.

376
00:16:28,899 --> 00:16:31,499
Any last words? No?
What?

377
00:16:35,105 --> 00:16:36,538
Wow.

378
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,643
Psychopath.

379
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,116
What?

380
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:50,285
I'm just looking.

381
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,721
Please go back to your desk.

382
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:54,789
In a minute.

383
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,362
Well, I remember why I dress
the way I do at work.

384
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:02,397
But I'm gonna keep the clothes.

385
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,732
I mean, it'll just be cool

386
00:17:03,734 --> 00:17:07,168
to have some after work clothes
other than pajamas.

387
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:16,678
Well, I guess it's time...

388
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,314
that I turn over the keys

389
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:21,116
to the famous Sebring.

390
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:22,751
No, thank you.

391
00:17:22,753 --> 00:17:24,052
It's a corporate lease, Dwight.

392
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:25,186
You've earned it.

393
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:26,755
No, thanks.
What?

394
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:28,923
Not my style.

395
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,327
But you said you liked it.

396
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,429
You've always admired it.

397
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:35,697
That was before.

398
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:36,965
I'm thinking about
getting something German.

399
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,066
Something with
decent gas mileage.

400
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,834
Plus the convertible

401
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:43,371
is a ridiculous choice
for this climate.

402
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:44,839
Take it back.

403
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:47,342
No.

404
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,747
That's my car.

405
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,419
What did you...
That's my car!

406
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:59,287
Yes.

407
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,356
I know, Dwight.
I know.

408
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:03,158
I know. I know.

409
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,459
You know what?

410
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:06,695
Jan called me
about your little meeting!

411
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,329
No.

412
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:11,166
I know what you did.

413
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:13,234
I made the whole thing up,
Dwight.

414
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:14,669
The Sebring's cool.
Oh, do you?

415
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:15,770
Do you like the Sebring?

416
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,205
How dare you!

417
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:19,040
How dare you, Dwight?

418
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:21,676
Don't fire me.
Please.

419
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:23,678
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire you

420
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,779
right here on the spot.

421
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:26,147
I have excellent sales numbers!

422
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:27,782
Not good enough!

423
00:18:27,784 --> 00:18:28,850
I'll do anything!

424
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:30,452
Anything!

425
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,420
I'll do your laundry
for a month!

426
00:18:32,422 --> 00:18:33,755
For a year!
Michael!

427
00:18:33,757 --> 00:18:35,557
I have a laundry machine.

428
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:38,460
I'm sorry.
I'll do anything.

429
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:40,195
Please.

430
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:42,197
Please.

431
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,299
I don't know if I can
trust you anymore.

432
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:45,567
You can't.
You can't.

433
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:47,268
But I promise I'll never
betray you again.

434
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,270
What can I do, Michael?

435
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:51,439
What can I do?

436
00:18:51,441 --> 00:18:54,209
What can I do?

437
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,411
What can I do?

438
00:18:56,413 --> 00:18:58,413
What can I do?

439
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:01,116
You can get up.

440
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:02,951
Get up.

441
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,459
And you can hug it out, bitch.

442
00:19:20,402 --> 00:19:22,170
Hug it out, bitch.

443
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,938
That is what men
say to each other

444
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,039
after a fight.

445
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,141
They hug it out.

446
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:27,642
And in doing so,

447
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:30,245
they just let it go.

448
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:32,113
And walk away.

449
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,582
Then they're done.

450
00:19:34,584 --> 00:19:37,185
Not a good idea to say that
to a woman, however...

451
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:39,521
I have found.

452
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:42,423
Doesn't translate.

453
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:15,890
Yeah. Yeah. We hugged it out.

454
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:19,561
But it turns out,
I was still a little angry.

455
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:24,465
So I felt I needed to punish him
just a little bit more.

456
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,534
And I'm making him
do my laundry for a year.
