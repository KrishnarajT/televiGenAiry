1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:02,762
Hey, Ryan.

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:04,764
Can I get you a pencil
from the warehouse?

3
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:06,599
Uh, no thanks.
I'm good.

4
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:08,634
Oh, it's okay.
I'm going down.

5
00:00:08,636 --> 00:00:10,002
Um...

6
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:11,237
Oh.

7
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:12,538
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,606
Absolutely.

9
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:15,174
All right, I'll be right back.

10
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:26,218
- Whoo!
- There you go.

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,219
Awesome!

12
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:28,354
- Thank you.
- You're welcome!

13
00:00:28,356 --> 00:00:29,722
Michael, could you get me a pen

14
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:30,790
from down in the warehouse?

15
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,425
Don't mind if I do.

16
00:00:33,894 --> 00:00:35,194
See you in a minute.

17
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:36,529
Okay!

18
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:47,339
Whoo!

19
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:48,541
There you go,
fresh from the warehouse.

20
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:49,775
Hey, Michael.

21
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:51,944
Would you get me some coffee
from the warehouse?

22
00:00:51,946 --> 00:00:53,579
There's coffee
in the kitchen, Pam.

23
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:56,115
But the warehouse coffee
tastes so much better.

24
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:57,116
Yeah, it's better.

25
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:59,385
All right.
All right.

26
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:01,353
Okay.

27
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:14,700
I am like Bette Midler
in For the Boys.

28
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:16,502
Gotta keep the troops
entertained.

29
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:26,479
With cream and sugar?

30
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,515
All right.

31
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:03,916
So I wanted to let you know

32
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:05,851
that we lost Ed Truck.

33
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:07,353
Oh... kay.

34
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,088
Let me see if I have his cell.

35
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,457
Is this the only reason
you are calling, Jan?

36
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,925
Or does somebody miss me?

37
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:17,563
Michael... Ed died
over the weekend.

38
00:02:17,565 --> 00:02:18,731
Oh, wow.

39
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:20,166
Attention, everybody.

40
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:22,301
I just received a call
from corporate

41
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:25,171
with some news that they felt
that I should know first.

42
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:26,605
My old boss,

43
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:28,874
Ed Truck, has died.

44
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,611
Oh, Michael,
that's such terrible news.

45
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:35,214
You must feel so sad.

46
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,383
Yes, I am.

47
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:39,485
It's very sad.

48
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:42,254
Because he was my boss.

49
00:02:42,256 --> 00:02:44,456
Oh, that's a shame.
Ed was a good guy.

50
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,425
That's right.
You worked with him.

51
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:49,028
So did Creed.

52
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,029
Well, I'll be in my office.

53
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:52,631
In case anybody
wants to drop by.

54
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,567
Cheer me up.

55
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:06,412
So did you hear the news?

56
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:08,180
The news that you
just announced?

57
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:09,248
That Ed died?

58
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,616
Yeah.

59
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:11,884
Is there anything I can do?

60
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:14,320
Oh, gosh, what can
anybody do, really?

61
00:03:14,322 --> 00:03:15,654
Just... psh.

62
00:03:15,656 --> 00:03:18,290
He was almost 70.
Circle of life.

63
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:20,326
Yeah.

64
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,799
Oh. Okay.

65
00:03:29,436 --> 00:03:30,536
Yeah.

66
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:33,906
Mmmmm.

67
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:36,108
Okay.

68
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,110
What's going on with
Fairfield County Schools?

69
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,912
Karen, did you generate
that price list?

70
00:03:39,914 --> 00:03:43,182
Um... shoot.
Uh, I will. Sorry.

71
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:45,584
Okay, just get it done.

72
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:46,619
Jim, will you make sure?

73
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,854
Oh, yeah, definitely.

74
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:51,323
Suck up!

75
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,391
Ahem!

76
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:53,692
Josh, did you hear what I said?

77
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:55,527
Thank you, everyone.

78
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,967
Damn it.

79
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,136
What's up?

80
00:04:04,138 --> 00:04:06,071
Oh, nothing.

81
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,907
They're just out
of Herr's Chips.

82
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:08,908
Oh.

83
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,909
But don't worry about it.

84
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,410
My snack food doesn't fall

85
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,345
under the umbrella
of your authority.

86
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:16,382
Mm, that's where you're wrong.

87
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:19,485
I'm your project
supervisor today.

88
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:20,920
And I've just decided

89
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:22,354
that we're not doing anything

90
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:25,124
until you get the chips
that you require.

91
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,793
So I think we should
go get some.

92
00:04:27,795 --> 00:04:29,628
Now, please.

93
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:32,731
It's a real shame about Ed, huh?

94
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,301
Yeah. Must really
have you thinkin'.

95
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:36,702
About what?

96
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:37,870
The older you get,

97
00:04:37,872 --> 00:04:39,738
the bigger the chance is
you're gonna die.

98
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,873
You knew that.

99
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,308
Ed was decapitated.

100
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,443
What?
Really?

101
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:45,744
He was drunk as a skunk.

102
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:47,446
He was flying down Route 6.

103
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:49,481
He slides under
an 18-wheeler.

104
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:50,883
Pop, it snaps right off.

105
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:52,818
Oh, my God.

106
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,687
That is the way to go.

107
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,823
Instant death.
Very smart.

108
00:04:57,825 --> 00:04:59,558
You know, a human can go on
living for several hours

109
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,226
after being decapitated.

110
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:03,195
You're thinking of a chicken.

111
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:04,763
What'd I say?

112
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,765
That is just not the way

113
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,367
a Dunder Mifflin manager
should go.

114
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:09,535
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:11,971
Alone, out of the blue.

116
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:14,373
Not even have his own head
to comfort him.

117
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:17,109
So I'm not exactly...

118
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,677
sure how to say this.

119
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,646
- Ed was decapitated.
- What are you doing?

120
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:22,481
You said you didn't
know how to say it.

121
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,249
He...

122
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,718
was driving

123
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,353
on the road.

124
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:29,355
And he went under a truck.

125
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,023
And that's when his

126
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:33,292
h-h-head was...

127
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:36,195
separated from...

128
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:37,563
the rest of him.

129
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:39,231
And I will let you know more

130
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,667
as soon as I find out.

131
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:46,605
Hey.
Hi.

132
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,340
If my head ever comes off,

133
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:50,075
I would like you
to put it on ice.

134
00:05:50,077 --> 00:05:52,311
I do not want
to talk about this.

135
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:54,713
When I die,

136
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:56,248
I want to be frozen.

137
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,283
And if they have to freeze me
in pieces,

138
00:05:58,285 --> 00:05:59,852
so be it.

139
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:02,021
I will wake up
stronger than ever,

140
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:03,622
because I will have
used that time

141
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:06,358
to figure out exactly
why I died,

142
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,559
and what moves I could have used

143
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:08,727
to defend myself better

144
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,030
now that I know what hold
he had me in.

145
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:13,465
I don't understand.

146
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,801
We have a day honoring
Martin Luther King.

147
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:18,437
But he didn't even work here.

148
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:20,105
I understand
how you feel, Michael.

149
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:21,507
I really do.

150
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:24,777
So would it be helpful
to give everyone the day off?

151
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,512
You really don't get it, do you?

152
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:27,713
You don't understand
these people.

153
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:29,715
That is the last thing
that they would want

154
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:30,849
is a day off.

155
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:33,352
Well, what would you suggest?

156
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:34,987
A statue.

157
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,488
- Of Ed?
- Yeah.

158
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,124
I'm not sure that's realistic.

159
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,126
Well, I think it would
be very realistic.

160
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:42,594
It would look just like him.

161
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:43,629
No, that's not...

162
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:44,963
We could have his eyes light up.

163
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:46,298
You could have his arms move.

164
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,400
That is not a statue.
That is a robot.

165
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:50,135
I think that is
a great way to honor Ed.

166
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:51,870
And how big
do you want this robot?

167
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:52,871
Life-size.

168
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:55,307
Mm, no.
Better make it 2/3.

169
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:56,809
Easier to stop
if it turns on us.

170
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:59,178
What the hell
are you two talking about?

171
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,081
Well, we are talking
about how to properly honor

172
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,682
a man who gave his life

173
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:06,385
as regional manger
of this company, Jan!

174
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:07,653
You know what, Michael?

175
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:08,787
I've really
tried with you today.

176
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,355
And I have to get back to work.

177
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:11,523
Oh, do you?

178
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:13,125
You know who wished
they could get back to work

179
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:14,259
is Ed Truck!

180
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,228
But Ed Truck can't
because he is...

181
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,396
- Good-bye.
- dead!

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,901
Look... I gave him
a six-foot extension cord,

183
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,403
so he can't chase us.

184
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:25,904
That's perfect.

185
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:29,541
Okay, that is a no
on the West Side Market.

186
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,643
Okay, great.
I think that's enough.

187
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,745
Can I... get back
to work now?

188
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:37,116
Wow. Never pegged you
for a quitter.

189
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:38,650
I am not a quitter.

190
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:40,385
I will do this
all day, if you want.

191
00:07:40,387 --> 00:07:41,820
- Really?
- Yeah, all day.

192
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:43,455
Hey.
What are we doing?

193
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:44,790
What's the game?
I want in.

194
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,091
Oh, there's no game.

195
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,626
We're just trying to get
these chips for Karen.

196
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:49,928
Did you check
the vending machine?

197
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,198
Oh, the vending machines?
How did we miss that?

198
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,867
I have no idea.

199
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:56,235
We went right for the copier.

200
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:57,936
Mm-hmm. And then we
checked the fax machine.

201
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,004
Yeah, nothing there.

202
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:01,940
Did you check your butt?

203
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:06,311
Ooh, can you imagine
how much blood there was?

204
00:08:06,313 --> 00:08:08,313
If it happened right here,

205
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:10,315
it would reach
all the way to reception.

206
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:11,450
Probably get on Pam.

207
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:13,552
- Okay, that's enough.
- What?

208
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:14,820
We do not want
to hear about this.

209
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:16,155
Well, you know what?

210
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:17,523
I didn't wanna
hear about it either, Stanley.

211
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:19,258
But I did, and now I can't
stop picturing it.

212
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,226
He leaves work.
He's on his way home.

213
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:24,563
Wham! His cappa is detated
from his head.

214
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:27,132
You have just spit on my face.

215
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,167
Well, you know what?

216
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,334
There's something wrong
with you.

217
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:31,236
There is something wrong
with everybody in here.

218
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:33,405
Because we have lost

219
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,240
a member of our family.

220
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:36,708
And you don't wanna
talk about it.

221
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,843
You don't wanna think about it.

222
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:40,078
You just wanna get back to work.

223
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,414
There are five stages to grief.

224
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,283
Which are denial,

225
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:47,819
anger, bargaining,
depression, and acceptance.

226
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:50,422
And right now, out there,

227
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:52,257
they are all denying

228
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:54,059
the fact that they're sad.

229
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:56,428
And... that's hard.

230
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,864
And it's making them all angry.

231
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:02,100
And it is my job
to try to get them

232
00:09:02,102 --> 00:09:04,670
all the way through
to acceptance.

233
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,572
And if not acceptance,
then just depression.

234
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:10,042
If I can get them depressed,
then I'll have done my job.

235
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,411
I'm going to throw you
this ball.

236
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,613
When you catch the ball,
I want you to say

237
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:17,583
the name of a person
very important to you,

238
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:20,118
somebody really special,
who died.

239
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,721
And then I want you to say
how they died.

240
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:24,389
And you may cry, if you like.

241
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,791
That is encouraged.

242
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:27,626
Let me just start.
Let me show you how this works.

243
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:29,795
I catch the ball.

244
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:31,730
I lost Ed Truck.

245
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:35,100
And... it feels like somebody
took my heart

246
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:39,805
and dropped it into a bucket
of boiling tears.

247
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:42,441
And, at the same time,

248
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:46,378
somebody else is hitting my soul

249
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,080
in the crotch

250
00:09:48,082 --> 00:09:51,083
with a frozen sledgehammer.

251
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:53,018
And then a third guy walks in

252
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,820
and starts punching me
in the grief bone.

253
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:57,222
And I am crying.

254
00:09:57,224 --> 00:09:58,724
And nobody can hear me,

255
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:02,794
because I am terribly,
terribly...

256
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:04,429
terribly alone.

257
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,498
Excuse me, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

258
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,799
I need to see Pam.

259
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,801
There seems to be, like,
something wrong

260
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:11,270
with the radiator in her car.

261
00:10:11,272 --> 00:10:12,271
Okay.

262
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,339
Fine.
Hurry back.

263
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,643
There's nothing wrong
with your car.

264
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:18,944
I just thought you might
want a break

265
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:21,546
from the grief
counseling session.

266
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:24,283
Oh... I would
like a break.

267
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:26,418
How are you liking the new car?

268
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,121
Great.
Yeah?

269
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:30,922
It sure is small.

270
00:10:32,226 --> 00:10:33,592
Got air bags?

271
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:34,993
I think so.

272
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:37,462
I don't know, I was mainly
focused on the cup holders.

273
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:42,801
Well, you're still not
driving so fast, are you?

274
00:10:42,803 --> 00:10:44,336
Yeah.

275
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:50,676
Hi, yeah, this is Mike
from the West Side Market.

276
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:52,377
Well, we added a shipment

277
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,513
of Herr's
salt and vinegar chips.

278
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:57,683
And we ordered that about
three weeks ago, and have...

279
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,384
Yeah.

280
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:00,652
You have 'em in the warehouse?

281
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:01,953
Great.

282
00:11:01,955 --> 00:11:04,990
What is my store number?

283
00:11:06,826 --> 00:11:07,959
Six.

284
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:11,163
Wa... no.
I'll call you back.

285
00:11:11,165 --> 00:11:12,998
Shut up.
Six?

286
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,636
Okay, we can start.

287
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:19,071
You waited for me?

288
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:20,238
Yeah.

289
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,673
Pam, you're a member
of this family.

290
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:22,741
So we will wait

291
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:24,476
for our family members.

292
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:25,844
Phyllis, you wanna
give it a shot?

293
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:27,713
I got it.

294
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:29,414
When my mother
was pregnant with me,

295
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,284
they did an ultrasound
and found she was having twins.

296
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:34,286
When they did another ultrasound

297
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:35,287
a few weeks later,

298
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:37,389
they discovered that

299
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:41,793
I had re-sorbed
the other fetus.

300
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,096
Do I regret this?
No.

301
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:46,531
I believe his tissue
has made me stronger.

302
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,734
I now have the strength
of a grown man

303
00:11:48,736 --> 00:11:50,836
and a little baby.

304
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:53,338
Okay, why don't you
throw the ball to somebody else?

305
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,473
Nope.

306
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:56,575
Oh, yes, Stanley,
Come on, your turn.

307
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:58,009
- You have to go.
- I will not!

308
00:11:58,011 --> 00:12:00,078
Okay...

309
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,346
I'm going to

310
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:02,681
toss the ball

311
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:04,783
to Pam.

312
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,151
Let's see.

313
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:07,819
I had an aunt

314
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:09,321
that I was really close to.

315
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:12,391
She was this amazing
female boxer.

316
00:12:12,393 --> 00:12:15,594
Um, anyway,
she was injured in a fight,

317
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:17,496
and she was paralyzed.

318
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:21,800
So you can imagine
how upset I was...

319
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:23,068
when I found out

320
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,970
that she asked her manager

321
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:27,005
to remove her breathing tube

322
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,175
so she could die.

323
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:32,744
Wow.

324
00:12:32,746 --> 00:12:35,180
If you want to cry, that's okay.

325
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:41,353
Thanks.
Um...

326
00:12:41,355 --> 00:12:42,921
A few years ago,

327
00:12:42,923 --> 00:12:45,490
my family was
on a safari in Africa.

328
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:49,294
And, um, my cousin...
Mufasa...

329
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:53,098
was, um, he was
trampled to death

330
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,966
by a pack of wildebeests.

331
00:12:54,968 --> 00:13:00,172
And, um, we all...
took it really hard.

332
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:03,341
All of us kind
of in the audience...

333
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,709
of what happened.

334
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,878
Do you wanna
talk about it anymore?

335
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,114
Oh, it would probably
take me, like,

336
00:13:09,116 --> 00:13:11,349
an hour and a half
to tell that whole story.

337
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,417
Me me, me me me.

338
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:14,386
Yes. Okay.

339
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:18,390
Um... I was trying
to throw this party once.

340
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:22,060
And everyone was over
for the weekend.

341
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:25,864
And then my Uncle Bernie died.

342
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:28,733
And so me and

343
00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:29,968
my best friend,

344
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,838
we had to pretend
like he was alive.

345
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,506
So...

346
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:36,274
Wait a second.

347
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:39,010
That's Weekend at Bernie's.

348
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Do you think that this
is a game?

349
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:43,748
Well, there is a ball.

350
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,783
All right, we're starting over.

351
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:46,084
No, I'm done.

352
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,019
You are not leaving!
No, we are not done.

353
00:13:48,021 --> 00:13:49,588
We really have
a lot of work to do.

354
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,655
Yeah, well, you know what?

355
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:53,925
The guy who had my job has died.

356
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:56,094
And nobody cares.

357
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:58,230
And he sat at my desk.

358
00:13:58,232 --> 00:13:59,831
Michael...

359
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,601
Look, I know
this is hard for you.

360
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:04,503
But death's just a part of life.

361
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,204
I mean, just this morning,
I saw a little bird

362
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:09,341
fly into the glass doors
downstairs and die.

363
00:14:09,343 --> 00:14:11,243
And I had to keep going.

364
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:12,711
How do you know?
What?

365
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:14,546
That that bird was dead?

366
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:16,548
Did you check...
its breathing?

367
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,616
It was obvious.

368
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:19,351
Was its heart beating, Toby?

369
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:21,586
Did you check it?
No, of course you didn't.

370
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:22,921
You're not a veterinarian.

371
00:14:22,923 --> 00:14:24,823
You don't know anything!

372
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,224
Michael!

373
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:30,095
Michael!

374
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:32,597
Michael!

375
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,698
Michael...

376
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,766
Oh, God.

377
00:14:34,768 --> 00:14:36,301
Ohh!
Oh, my God!

378
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:38,436
Oh, my God!
Come on.

379
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:39,471
Poor little fella.

380
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:40,839
- Oh, shoot.
- He's a goner.

381
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,474
- No, he's not.
- Yeah.

382
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:43,542
No, he's not.

383
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:44,943
Michael, get him
away from your head!

384
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,211
He is covered
in germs and bacteria!

385
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:48,780
You can't get
diseases from a bird!

386
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:51,383
A dead bird should not
be in the kitchen.

387
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:52,417
We don't know if it's dead.

388
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:55,186
Uh, no, that thing is dead.

389
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:56,488
You want me to flush him?

390
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:00,358
Attention, everybody.

391
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,227
This will only take a second...

392
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:04,729
of your time.

393
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,331
Today at 4:00 p.m.,

394
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,867
we will be meeting
in the parking lot

395
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:13,271
to have a funeral service
for this bird.

396
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:14,439
I have a lot of work to do.

397
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:17,242
Well... I'm sorry
to inconvenience you,

398
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:18,543
Meredith.

399
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:21,279
But that is what you do
when things die.

400
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:22,614
You honor them.

401
00:15:22,616 --> 00:15:24,349
Toby killed this bird.

402
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,951
And now we are going
to honor it.

403
00:15:25,953 --> 00:15:27,419
- But...
- No! No! No!

404
00:15:27,421 --> 00:15:28,553
That's enough.
You know what?

405
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:30,989
This bird is dead.

406
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:32,057
It died alone.

407
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:33,558
The least you can do

408
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,861
is be there for him now.

409
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:40,699
Find a box for him.

410
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:43,268
I'm calling a supermarket
in Montreal.

411
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,502
Nice.

412
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:46,538
Bonjour, je cherche

413
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,740
de chips de la marque Herr's.

414
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:50,342
Non?

415
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:53,244
Oh, merci comme même.

416
00:15:53,246 --> 00:15:54,613
Au revoir.

417
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:55,680
Nope.

418
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:57,616
- Sounded good.
- Thanks.

419
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,093
It's okay.

420
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:09,494
It's okay.

421
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:11,396
Shh.
Yes, I know.

422
00:16:11,398 --> 00:16:13,231
I know it's been a tough day.

423
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,166
But it's good to let it show.

424
00:16:15,168 --> 00:16:18,470
I mean, how many times
do I have to confirm plans

425
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:21,373
with Ryan for him to know
that we have a date tonight?

426
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,746
God.

427
00:16:27,748 --> 00:16:29,247
What are...

428
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,548
What are you doing?

429
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,883
What?

430
00:16:31,885 --> 00:16:33,184
No, this is
about the right size.

431
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,553
No, God, no!
It's not!

432
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:37,122
What is the matter with you?

433
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:38,623
Is that the beak?

434
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,627
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.

435
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,463
We slaughtered a pig
whenever we wanted bacon.

436
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:48,600
My grandfather was re-buried
in an old oil drum.

437
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:53,605
It would've fit if he had
given me another minute.

438
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,473
I need a box.

439
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,876
I need a box, a small box.

440
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:00,178
Not too confining.

441
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,513
- Is it for the bird?
- Yeah.

442
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,647
I have it covered.

443
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,849
Oh, thank you.

444
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:07,986
If you want to do something
for the funeral...

445
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:09,387
Yes, please.

446
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:10,989
Maybe you could play a song
on your recorder. Excellent.

447
00:17:10,991 --> 00:17:12,891
Do you have it with you?
Always.

448
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:17,662
Did I wake up this morning
thinking I'd be

449
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,397
throwing together
a bird funeral?

450
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:22,333
You never can tell
what your day here

451
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:23,902
is gonna turn into.

452
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,141
Where'd you find them?

453
00:17:30,143 --> 00:17:31,976
Where'd I find what?

454
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:41,653
I called the manufacturer,

455
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:43,688
who referred me
to the distributor,

456
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,790
who referred me
to the vending machine company,

457
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:48,259
who told me that
they sell them in the machines

458
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:49,994
in the building next door.

459
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:51,930
Glad you could all make it.

460
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,431
You told us we had to.

461
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,200
Dwight, do you have the box?

462
00:17:55,202 --> 00:17:56,935
Actually, I have it.

463
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,873
You made this?

464
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,541
Wow.

465
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:06,878
That's...
that's very nice.

466
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
When I was five, my mom told me

467
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:10,815
that my fish
went to the hospital

468
00:18:10,817 --> 00:18:12,283
in the toilet.

469
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:14,185
And it never came back.

470
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:16,087
So we had a funeral for it.

471
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:17,455
And I remember thinking,

472
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:19,491
"I'm a little too old
for this."

473
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:22,527
And I was five.

474
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:23,862
I'd also like
to say a few words,

475
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:25,130
if that's okay.

476
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:28,032
Yes.

477
00:18:28,034 --> 00:18:31,069
What do we know about this bird?

478
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:34,439
You might think,
"Not much, it's just a bird."

479
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,541
But we do know some things.

480
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:39,611
We know it was a local bird.

481
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:43,181
Maybe it's that same bird
that surprised Oscar

482
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:46,050
that one morning with
a special present from above.

483
00:18:46,052 --> 00:18:48,186
Oh, I remember that.
That was so funny.

484
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:49,954
And we know how he died.

485
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,891
Flying into the glass doors.

486
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:54,125
But you know what,

487
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:56,161
I don't think
he was being stupid.

488
00:18:56,163 --> 00:18:58,630
I think he just...

489
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:01,499
really, really wanted
to come inside our building

490
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:04,169
to spread his cheer

491
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:06,504
and lift our spirits
with a song.

492
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:08,239
- It's not a songbird.
- Shh.

493
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:09,808
An impression, then.

494
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,844
Lastly, we can't help but notice

495
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:14,979
that he was by himself
when he died.

496
00:19:14,981 --> 00:19:16,848
But of course, we all know

497
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,450
that doesn't mean he was alone.

498
00:19:19,452 --> 00:19:20,752
Because I'm sure

499
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:22,453
that there were lots
of other birds

500
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:23,855
out there who cared for him

501
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:26,090
very much.

502
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:28,526
He will not be forgotten.
Amen.

503
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,510
Society teaches us

504
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:49,781
that having feelings and crying

505
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:52,417
is bad and wrong.

506
00:19:52,419 --> 00:19:55,053
Well, that's baloney,

507
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:59,290
because grief isn't wrong.

508
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,759
There is such a thing
as good grief.

509
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:04,195
Just ask Charlie Brown.

510
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:13,037
Let's get back to work.

511
00:20:27,353 --> 00:20:28,620
Guys, get a broom.

512
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:30,154
Let's clean this up.

513
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:31,756
Grab a broom.

514
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:33,825
You heard me.
Mush.
