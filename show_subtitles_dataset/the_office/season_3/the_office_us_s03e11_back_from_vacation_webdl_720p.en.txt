1
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:02,882
Oh, first off,

2
00:00:02,884 --> 00:00:05,117
we're supposed to be
pushing card stock this week,

3
00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:08,788
so... let's push card stock
this week.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,625
Uh, also...
What is this?

5
00:00:12,627 --> 00:00:13,993
Tape recorder.

6
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:15,127
For what?

7
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,396
For recording.

8
00:00:17,398 --> 00:00:18,564
Michael is on vacation,

9
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,299
and he has asked me
to record all meetings

10
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:21,801
and to type up the transcripts.

11
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:24,637
Okay, uh, Karen, I need news
from that law firm.

12
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:26,105
Yeah, the deal closed yesterday.

13
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:27,440
It's a 6-month commitment.

14
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:28,774
Oh, my God.
Dwight, what are you doing?

15
00:00:28,776 --> 00:00:30,309
What?

16
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:31,711
You're not allowed
to take off your pants

17
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:33,279
in the middle of the office.

18
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:35,247
- I'm not.
- Dwight, you know what? Just back off.

19
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:36,382
Okay, that's
making me uncomfortable.

20
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:38,517
This is sexual harassment,
by the way.

21
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:39,685
Oh, my God.

22
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:40,853
He's got a knife!

23
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:42,321
I do not have a knife.

24
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,523
No. Let the record show
that Dwight K. Schrute

25
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,259
is now completely nude
and is holding a plastic knife

26
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,260
to Stanley's neck.

27
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:49,495
Let the record show

28
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:51,297
that Jim Halpert is a liar.

29
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,165
Dwight Schrute is now
wearing a baby's bonnet.

30
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:54,233
I am not.

31
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:55,501
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in.

32
00:00:55,503 --> 00:00:57,069
Dwight, get his autograph
for Michael, quickly.

33
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,838
Jim Carrey did not
just walk in, okay?

34
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,206
Dwight, what is that
on your stomach?

35
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,707
Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?

36
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:02,842
Oh, my God, Karen, you're right.

37
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:03,843
That is Animal

38
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:04,910
from the Muppet Babies.

39
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:06,078
You can't see my stomach.

40
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,947
I am now chopping off
Phyllis' head

41
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:10,416
with a chainsaw!

42
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:58,164
Hey, mon.

43
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,533
- Hey.
- Look.

44
00:02:00,535 --> 00:02:02,468
You have a bunch
of messages, and...

45
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,469
That's nice.

46
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:04,904
Hannah quit while you were gone.

47
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,473
I guess she memo-ed to file
some complaints she had

48
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:08,908
about being a working mother.

49
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,509
And so you might also
have to be deposed.

50
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:11,510
Blah, blah, blah, blah,

51
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:12,912
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

52
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:13,913
- Relax.
- Okay.

53
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:15,748
Okay, I'll get
to all of it later.

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,882
It's kinda serious.

55
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:18,884
Aren't you gonna ask me
how Jamaica was?

56
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,820
Say it. Ask me.

57
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,555
How was Jamaica?

58
00:02:22,557 --> 00:02:24,757
It was so good.
Oh!

59
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,226
Hey, mon!

60
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:28,894
At Sandals Jamaica,

61
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:31,096
when somebody says,
"Hey, mon," everybody says,

62
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:32,264
"Hey, mon," back.

63
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:33,833
Oh, Michael,

64
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm glad you're here.

65
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:36,368
Stanley, you know what?

66
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,170
It is really good
to see you too.

67
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:40,072
My bonus check was $100 less

68
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:41,207
than you promised.

69
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:43,142
Okay, well, payroll
is in charge of all of that.

70
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,276
They said I should talk to you.

71
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:46,111
Well, I am just
getting settled in.

72
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:47,580
So I'm gonna...

73
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:50,416
I am not doin' a lick more work
until I get my full bonus check.

74
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:53,752
You are not as much fun
as your Jamaican brothers.

75
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:56,021
Mon.

76
00:02:57,257 --> 00:02:59,725
Do you wanna talk about it?

77
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:00,826
Nope.

78
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:05,931
I still haven't
found an apartment yet.

79
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,399
I'm living in a hotel.

80
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:09,301
Yesterday
I saw a "For Rent" sign

81
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:10,836
down the street from Jim,

82
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:13,405
and he said he didn't think
it'd be such a good idea.

83
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:16,375
He said it would be
like we were living together.

84
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:18,277
In different houses.

85
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,645
Two blocks away.

86
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:35,828
That's all I know so far,
but I'm gonna keep practicing.

87
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,829
That's good.

88
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:40,666
You know, I had never been out
of the country before now?

89
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:41,700
Oh.

90
00:03:41,702 --> 00:03:43,369
Got to see how Jamaicans live.

91
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:44,470
It is great, you know.

92
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:45,471
They just relax.

93
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:46,639
They party all the time.

94
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:48,641
It's kind
of an impoverished country.

95
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:50,509
Yeah. Gosh...

96
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:51,510
Great.

97
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:52,678
You know what, Pam?

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,179
Make a note.

99
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:57,683
I want us all to start
having piÃ±a coladas

100
00:03:57,685 --> 00:03:58,884
every day at 3:00.

101
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,352
Well, you can't today.

102
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:01,453
We're doing inventory.

103
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:03,055
Inventory's at the end
of December.

104
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,990
We couldn't do it without you,
so we postponed.

105
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,526
Oh... I specifically
went on vacation

106
00:04:07,528 --> 00:04:08,661
so I would miss it.

107
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,696
Inventory is boring.

108
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:12,932
In the islands,
they don't make you do stuff,

109
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,034
like take inventory.

110
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,670
Why do you think so many
businesses move to the Caymans?

111
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:21,473
Tonight, we are going to have
an inventory luau.

112
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:24,276
I want to bring back
a little slice of paradise

113
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:27,179
to the Dunder-Mifflin
warehouse inventory.

114
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:28,948
So, party planning committee,
get on it.

115
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,449
By the end of the day?

116
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,117
That's impossible.

117
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,920
The Jamaicans don't have a word
for "impossible."

118
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:36,522
Yep, it's English.
It's impossible.

119
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:37,957
Michael, there's no way

120
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,124
we can do it in time.

121
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,592
How hard is a luau?

122
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,662
All you need are some
grass skirts, pineapple, poi,

123
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:46,098
tiki torches, suckling pig.

124
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,633
Some fire dancers.

125
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:51,303
That's all you need.

126
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:54,373
Come on in.

127
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,975
Settle in.

128
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,211
Settling.

129
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:00,879
Settling.

130
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,514
And... settled, good.

131
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:03,682
There is something

132
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:05,751
I would like to show everybody.

133
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:06,752
See this sign?

134
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:09,221
"No shirt, no shoes,
no problem."

135
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:11,256
This is an attitude

136
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:14,093
I would like all of you
to have right here.

137
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,829
So what if we have to stay late
and do inventory.

138
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:18,597
No problem.

139
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,800
- Oh, my God. Is that Jan?
- What?

140
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,002
- Where?
- On the left.

141
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:24,103
Oh, Yeah.

142
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:25,371
- Oh, my God!
- No, no, no, no.

143
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:28,907
No. That's a German woman
named Urkel Grue.

144
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:32,778
Jan told me to play it cool
and not tell anybody

145
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,214
because it could
get us both in trouble.

146
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:39,118
So, officially,
I did not see her.

147
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,789
But I did see Jan there.

148
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,492
In our room.

149
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:48,827
At night.

150
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,462
And in the morning.

151
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:52,031
And that's all I'm gonna say.

152
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,834
Except...

153
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:58,103
sex.

154
00:05:58,105 --> 00:05:59,271
We had sex.

155
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:04,576
I had sex with her.

156
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:06,245
I had sex with Jan.

157
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:09,014
Hey, dude.
Just got back from Jamaica.

158
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,150
Big whoop.
I was in Hotlanta.

159
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:13,052
That whole town is whack.

160
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:15,387
Yeah, that sounds amazing,
but you know what?

161
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,091
The lady, Jan Levinson,
wanted to go to Montego Bay.

162
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:21,160
You took the Ice Queen?

163
00:06:21,162 --> 00:06:22,961
I don't buy it.

164
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:26,165
Well, I'm looking at a photo
right now,

165
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:29,768
and I'm tellin' ya,
it could be in Maxim.

166
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,471
They wouldn't give you
a subscription to Maxim.

167
00:06:32,473 --> 00:06:33,772
- Oh, no?
- No

168
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:34,773
Okay.

169
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:37,576
Well...

170
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:40,712
Check this out.

171
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:44,716
I'm sending you
some e-mail.

172
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,119
You got it?

173
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:49,855
What? No.
I got nothin'.

174
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:51,924
Check it again.
Hit "refresh."

175
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:54,960
Yeah, Mike, still nothin'.

176
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:56,095
Okay, wait a second.

177
00:06:56,097 --> 00:07:02,568
I sent it to you
at packer@dunder-mifflin.com

178
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,871
Packaging
at Dunder-Mifflin...

179
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:07,005
Uh-oh.

180
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,143
Wait. I just got it
from somebody else.

181
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:13,579
Wow, this is hot.

182
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,114
Damn!

183
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:17,082
How do I get you
out of this picture?

184
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,424
Ahh...

185
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:26,658
Darryl!

186
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:29,428
Hey, hi.

187
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,429
Where's Darryl?

188
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:31,964
He's, uh, in the office.

189
00:07:31,966 --> 00:07:34,099
Okay. Hi.

190
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:36,235
Hey, man, How's it goin'?

191
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,569
All right.
what's up, Mike?

192
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:39,838
That's great.
Okay, um.

193
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,141
So did you get an email from me?

194
00:07:42,143 --> 00:07:43,342
- Yeah.
- Okay.

195
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:46,879
Well, that was supposed to
go to Packer,

196
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,046
not "packaging."

197
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:49,348
Hmm.

198
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,784
Did you already forward it
to a whole bunch of people?

199
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:53,852
Uh-huh.

200
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:55,821
Okay. Um...

201
00:07:55,823 --> 00:07:59,124
Well, did you get
the second email that I sent,

202
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:00,926
explaining that the first email
was a mistake

203
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:02,060
and that you should delete it.

204
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:03,328
Yep.

205
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,130
And you sent that out
to everyone?

206
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:09,434
Mike, I'm very busy down here.

207
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:10,335
Yikes.

208
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:12,271
Already sent it
to you, my friend.

209
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:13,405
Fantastic.

210
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:14,439
Boring.

211
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,708
Call me if she rolls over.

212
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,011
Hey.

213
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:20,179
Hey.

214
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,015
You okay?

215
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:24,016
Yeah.

216
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:28,820
You sure?

217
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,223
Yeah.

218
00:08:31,225 --> 00:08:33,091
Yes.

219
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:40,499
I'm just in this, like,
stupid fight with Karen.

220
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:41,934
Oh.

221
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,271
You want to talk about it?

222
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:49,141
Really?

223
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:55,480
I have a special assignment
for you.

224
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:57,182
Who's the target?

225
00:08:57,184 --> 00:09:01,587
A sensitive email has been
released to the office.

226
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,889
It contains a file,

227
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:06,158
a picture...

228
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,927
the file name
is "Jamaica Jan Sun Princess."

229
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,128
What's it of?

230
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,396
Not important.

231
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:12,898
Unless you're willing
to tell me everything,

232
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,099
I cannot accept this assignment.

233
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:15,534
- Okay, forget it.
- Okay, I accept it.

234
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:16,802
So, I don't know,

235
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:18,637
I just feel like
we've been dating a month,

236
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,938
right?

237
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,974
Same street... I think
that might be a little close,

238
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:23,075
a little bit much.

239
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:25,944
Hmm.

240
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:27,312
"Hmm," what?

241
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,117
How far away does she live now,
like, ten minutes?

242
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:35,988
Yeah, I guess.

243
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,324
Honestly, I think you
should go easy on her.

244
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,028
No, I didn't mind helping Jim
with his problem.

245
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,497
That's what friends do.

246
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:48,700
I... help Phyllis
all the time.

247
00:09:48,702 --> 00:09:52,804
Just yesterday I untangled
a piece of tape from her hair.

248
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:56,174
So... yeah.

249
00:09:58,911 --> 00:09:59,978
Hey.

250
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,814
Thanks a lot.

251
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:06,551
Oh, don't worry about it.

252
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:08,086
I mean, it's better

253
00:10:08,088 --> 00:10:10,555
than listening to Michael
play a conch shell,

254
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,891
which is what I was doing.

255
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,561
Oh, also,

256
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:19,097
Michael went to Jamaica
with Jan.

257
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,133
Yeah. How have we not talked
about this already?

258
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:23,068
I mean, what happened there?

259
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:25,037
Kidnapping?

260
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,973
Hey, I need to talk to you.

261
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,207
Not now, not ever.

262
00:10:29,209 --> 00:10:30,542
About you and Jan.

263
00:10:30,544 --> 00:10:32,110
Ah, none of your business.

264
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:35,347
Well, I wish that were true,
but it... it, um...

265
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:36,848
it seems from that photo

266
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,551
that you two... you've entered
into an intimate relationship.

267
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:40,719
That photo
is my personal property.

268
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:41,920
And if you are telling me

269
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:43,989
that you went on my computer
and stole that photo,

270
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:46,391
then I am going
to call the cops.

271
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:48,894
Michael, nine different people
emailed me that photo,

272
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:51,830
including my ex-wife,
and, well, we don't talk.

273
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:54,933
Well, then this was probably
the ice-breaker you need.

274
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,301
You know,
for your own protection,

275
00:10:56,303 --> 00:10:59,171
you should disclose
the relationship to H.R.

276
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:01,506
I bet you would love
all the details, wouldn't you,

277
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:03,175
skeevy little perv?

278
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:04,943
All right, if you're
having a relationship

279
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:06,745
with your superior,
you must disclose it.

280
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:07,746
No, no.

281
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:09,081
No, I am not dating Jan.

282
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,616
She was very clear about that.

283
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:14,753
Just two like souls
having a romantic time

284
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:17,622
in the most romantic place
on earth.

285
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:19,024
Got enough, weirdo?

286
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:21,526
- All right. Thanks, Michael.
- Okay.

287
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:24,596
Okay, we only have 3 hours,
people, to plan a whole luau.

288
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:26,365
And you're not helping.

289
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,133
What are the ingredients of poi?

290
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:30,235
I called every grocery store
in Scranton,

291
00:11:30,237 --> 00:11:31,570
and no one sells whole pigs.

292
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:33,138
Did you try the petting zoo?

293
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:38,377
Dunder-Mifflin.
This is Pam.

294
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:39,745
Just a second.

295
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:40,979
Michael?

296
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:42,647
It's Jan on the phone for you.

297
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,182
Oh, no, no, no.

298
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:45,751
Hang up.
Hang up.

299
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:47,018
Tell her I'm not here.

300
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,053
Don't.

301
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,721
I've ran out of gas.

302
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:50,822
Hit a deer.

303
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:54,092
I hit a deer with my car.

304
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:55,260
Tell her I hit a cat!

305
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:56,361
Tell her I hit a cat.

306
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:57,529
He'll call you back.

307
00:11:57,531 --> 00:12:00,665
- Okay.
- Great.

308
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,167
Do you think she bought it?

309
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:03,268
Okay.

310
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:05,303
Okay.

311
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,576
Michael hit a deer?

312
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:13,078
Michael!

313
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,213
Michael, there's an emergency
in the warehouse.

314
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:16,481
An accident?
Is somebody hurt?

315
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:19,384
No, it's...
involves a photograph.

316
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:23,755
- Oh, God, no!
- No, no, no, no.

317
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,032
Mike, you a rock star, man.

318
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,368
You are the man!

319
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,502
Yeah! Well done.

320
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:39,471
All right, okay.

321
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:42,140
That corporate booty,
he likes to hit it!

322
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,382
Hello, hi, attention, everyone.

323
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:54,619
Um, apparently there is an email
circulating around

324
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,988
that contains
a very PG-13 rated picture

325
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,657
of me and a woman.

326
00:12:58,659 --> 00:12:59,658
Jan.

327
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,793
No, Kevin, a woman!

328
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,028
Maybe Jan, maybe...

329
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,196
Urkel Grue.

330
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:06,498
My point is that if you get it,

331
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,401
I would ask that you
just delete it, sight unseen.

332
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:11,970
Let's be professional,
all right?

333
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:17,142
Hey.

334
00:13:17,144 --> 00:13:18,176
Hey.

335
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:19,177
What are you doing out here?

336
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,346
Island living, you know.

337
00:13:21,348 --> 00:13:23,348
Jan called.

338
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,417
She's coming in later
to talk to you.

339
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:26,718
Did she say what it's about?

340
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,553
That's all she said.

341
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:53,478
Uh, I think you dropped this.

342
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:58,416
- You sure?
- Definitely.

343
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:03,355
I have disconnected
the office T1 line.

344
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:05,690
I've ordered that that
be taken down.

345
00:14:05,692 --> 00:14:07,959
And I destroyed all print outs
from the bathroom.

346
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,928
There were copies
in the bathroom?

347
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,963
There were.
A lot of them.

348
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:14,699
All right.

349
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,473
I think I owe you one.

350
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:22,974
Sorry?

351
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:24,476
For talking sense into Halpert.

352
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:26,278
The Day's Inn room 228
was starting

353
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,579
to get really depressing.

354
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:29,314
Oh, yeah, no,
don't worry about it.

355
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:31,449
I mean, he was being ridiculous.

356
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:32,651
Yeah.

357
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:34,553
But thanks, seriously.

358
00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:36,121
Sure.

359
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,595
Oh, ho, ho, yes!

360
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:45,964
Yes! What I tell you?

361
00:14:45,966 --> 00:14:47,198
I knew he'd turn up.

362
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,534
You see that?

363
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,603
This is the greatest night
of my life.

364
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:05,016
Who did this to you?

365
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,384
Where is he?

366
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:08,720
What?

367
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:10,655
No, it's not...

368
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:12,057
It's nothing.

369
00:15:22,234 --> 00:15:24,736
It's hot in here.

370
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:25,737
Yeah.

371
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,973
Yeah.

372
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,550
Thanks.

373
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:42,921
You don't need to stay here.

374
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:45,090
I know.

375
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:04,843
So you're PMSing
pretty bad, huh?

376
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:31,269
Hello, everyone.

377
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:32,270
Hello, Michael.

378
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:33,638
Hello.

379
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,873
Hi, Jan.

380
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,542
You look... tan.

381
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:41,546
I was in Scottsdale
visiting my sister.

382
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,381
Yeah?

383
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:45,617
How was it?

384
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:47,786
Very sunny.

385
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:49,020
Family's important.

386
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:53,625
Michael, I would like to speak
with you in your office.

387
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:56,194
- Okay, yep.
- Please.

388
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,897
Why am I here, Michael?

389
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:34,766
Uh...

390
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:36,735
In the last year I've gone
through a divorce,

391
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:41,606
an identity theft,
a husband who would not...

392
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:42,741
communicate.

393
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:43,808
This is neither here nor there.

394
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,443
My psychiatrist thinks
that I have

395
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:47,245
some self-destructive
tendencies.

396
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:49,681
And that for once,
I should indulge them.

397
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:50,982
You following me?

398
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:53,551
Uh, uh, yes.

399
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:56,654
I think I owe it to myself

400
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:58,990
to find some kind of happiness.

401
00:17:58,992 --> 00:18:02,761
You know, I mean,
even if it means

402
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:06,865
lowering my expectations
or redefining the word itself.

403
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:08,299
Okay, yeah.

404
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:09,768
This is the thing, you know.

405
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,204
I am attracted to you.

406
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:15,440
I-I don't know why I...

407
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:18,376
But I am.

408
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:21,446
And... I need to follow
my instincts.

409
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:24,015
At least, that's
what Dr. Perry thinks.

410
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:26,384
Who's Dr. Perry?

411
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:28,820
This is the point, okay?

412
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:30,121
You're wrong for me.

413
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:31,890
Okay.

414
00:18:31,892 --> 00:18:35,126
In... in every way.

415
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:37,762
Well, not...

416
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:42,033
But I still find myself
wanting to...

417
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:48,006
be with you.

418
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:52,076
And I, to you,

419
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:54,779
in addition, feel

420
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:59,217
the same feelings
that you are as well.

421
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:09,694
Good, good.

422
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:15,834
So, um, thanks for coming by.

423
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:17,035
So, I, uh...

424
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:18,036
No, good.

425
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:19,037
Okay.

426
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,672
Okay.

427
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:23,441
Thank you for taking the time.

428
00:19:23,443 --> 00:19:25,076
Well, thanks
for coming over, I appre...

429
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:26,678
Mm.

430
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:33,751
Wait 15 minutes, find an excuse,

431
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:34,886
and meet me at your condo.

432
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:39,257
Okay.

433
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:42,026
Jan.

434
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:44,996
You complete me.

435
00:19:50,636 --> 00:19:51,970
Oh, God.

436
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:59,344
Hey.

437
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:02,313
Remember when we were planning
our honeymoon,

438
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:04,716
and you wanted to go to Hawaii,

439
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:07,018
and I wanted to go to Mexico?

440
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,187
Yeah.

441
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:12,690
I was definitely right.

442
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,431
Oh, brother.

443
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,400
What am I gonna do?

444
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:25,837
I'm gonna hang it up at home.

445
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,972
I don't have a lot of art.
