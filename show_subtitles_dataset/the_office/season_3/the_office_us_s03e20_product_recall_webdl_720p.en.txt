1
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,641
It's kinda blurry.

2
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:21,113
That's better.

3
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:27,052
Question.

4
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:29,221
What kind of bear is best?

5
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:31,423
That's a ridiculous question.

6
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:33,225
False.
Black bear.

7
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,760
Well, that's debatable.

8
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:36,662
There are basically
two schools of thought...

9
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:39,031
Fact.
Bears eat beets.

10
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:41,233
Bears. Beets.

11
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:42,735
Battlestar Galactica.

12
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:45,571
Bears do not...
What is going on?

13
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:47,072
What are you doing?

14
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:49,074
Last week, I was in a drugstore,

15
00:00:49,076 --> 00:00:50,576
and I saw these glasses.

16
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:52,277
Uh, $4.

17
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:54,046
And it only cost me $7.

18
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,115
To recreate the rest
of the ensemble,

19
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:59,018
and that's a grand total of...

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,353
$11.

21
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:02,588
You know what?

22
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,423
Imitation is the most
sincere form of flattery.

23
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,625
So I thank you.

24
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:08,660
Identity theft
is not a joke, Jim!

25
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:12,031
Millions of families suffer
every year!

26
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,632
Michael!

27
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:14,767
Oh, that's funny.

28
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,402
Michael!

29
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,102
Yes, I understand.

30
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:52,004
Can I transfer you
to Customer Relations?

31
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:52,938
Absolutely.

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,706
I couldn't be
more sorry about this.

33
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,475
I know, I know.

34
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:58,677
We're all trying to get
to the bottom of this.

35
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,345
I am upset.
Don't I sound upset?

36
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:03,015
I totally agree.

37
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:06,852
Well, we're going to be
recalling all of that paper.

38
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:08,353
We have a crisis.

39
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:11,356
Apparently, a disgruntled
employee at the paper mill

40
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:14,193
decided that it would be funny
to put an obscene watermark

41
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:18,430
on our 24-pound
cream letter stock.

42
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:21,266
500 boxes has gone out

43
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:24,303
with the image
of a beloved cartoon duck

44
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:26,672
performing...

45
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:29,675
unspeakable acts upon a...

46
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:33,412
certain cartoon mouse
that a lot of people like.

47
00:02:33,414 --> 00:02:35,447
I've never been a fan.

48
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:37,483
Everybody in here, STAT.

49
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:39,785
No time to lose.

50
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:42,855
Cry-Man Squaw, F and C,
double time.

51
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,623
Cry-Man Squaw?

52
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,958
Crisis Management Squad.

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,992
F and C, double time?

54
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,360
Front and center,

55
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:50,028
twice as fast
as you would normally go.

56
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,465
Why are you talking like that?
To save time, Jim.

57
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:55,000
Actually, I think
you could make the argument

58
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:55,901
that it wastes time.

59
00:02:55,903 --> 00:02:57,936
Yeah, she has a good point.

60
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:00,005
I mean, for example,
with the last thing you said,

61
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,874
by the time you explained it,

62
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:02,774
it actually took up more time.

63
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:04,409
You know what?
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

64
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:06,545
Forget it.
Where's Creed?

65
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,113
Creed, quality assurance.
Here.

66
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:09,781
Your job.

67
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:13,385
I really think you screwed
the pooch on this one, Creed.

68
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:16,622
Because of you, the entire
company is in jeopardy.

69
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,791
Every week, I'm supposed
to take four hours

70
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,127
and do a quality spot-check
at the paper mill.

71
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:24,763
And, of course,
the one year I blow it off,

72
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:27,032
this happens.

73
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,967
We have a lot of angry
customers out there.

74
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:30,936
This puts us
at threat level Midnight.

75
00:03:30,938 --> 00:03:34,106
Accounting, you are on customer
service duty today.

76
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:35,374
That's really not our job.

77
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:37,042
Midnight, Oscar!

78
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:39,511
Don't worry, Kelly will be
training you first.

79
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:41,613
Kelly's training us?

80
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,782
This day is bananas.

81
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:45,584
B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

82
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:47,386
This day is bananas.

83
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:48,587
B-A-N-A...

84
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,792
I don't have a headache.

85
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:55,861
I'm just preparing.

86
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,997
Jim, big fire in your house.

87
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:01,099
Your client,
Dunmore High School,

88
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:04,069
sent out their prom invitations
on this paper.

89
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:06,438
- Went home to all the kids.
- Yeah, I got a call out on them.

90
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,606
No, no, no.
Not good enough.

91
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,007
This is a keystone account.

92
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:10,742
I want you in the school.
In person.

93
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:11,977
- Sure. I want you
to bring a partner.

94
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:14,813
We need somebody
who's actually made a sale.

95
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:16,048
Andy, you go.

96
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,416
William Dolittle,

97
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:18,951
at your service.

98
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:21,553
AKA, Will Do.

99
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:23,455
Yeah, I'm definitely
gonna go alone.

100
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:25,390
No, no.
I need two men on this.

101
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:26,892
That's what she said.
No time!

102
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:28,727
But she did.
No time!

103
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:32,864
Dwight, I want you to be in
charge of the press conference.

104
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:35,701
Yes! You're entering
the "No Spin Zone."

105
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,569
We're having a press conference?

106
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:39,938
No, Pam, the press is just
gonna find out by themselves.

107
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,541
Not.

108
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:43,508
Here's the thing.

109
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,511
best thing to do is to call
a press conference.

110
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:49,581
Alert the media,
and then you control the story.

111
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,884
Wait for them to find out,
and the story controls you.

112
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:54,920
That's what happened to O.J.

113
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,788
I have invited Barbara Allen,

114
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,057
one of our oldest clients,
to come in here

115
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,960
and meet with me
for a personal apology.

116
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:04,830
The press wants a story.
I will give them a story.

117
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:06,932
Oh, did the press
ask for a story?

118
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:08,667
Here is your headline.

119
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,638
"Scranton-area paper company,
Dunder-Mifflin,

120
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,141
"apologizes to valued client.

121
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:19,044
"Some companies still know

122
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:21,880
how business is done."

123
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,081
Okay?

124
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:26,351
Battle stations, everybody.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

125
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:27,653
Yes, hello.

126
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,121
Creed Bratton,
Quality Assurance.

127
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:30,989
Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton.

128
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:33,992
I was supposed to meet
with one of your floor managers

129
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:36,061
last week
for a quality inspection,

130
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:38,797
and he or she wasn't there.

131
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:41,700
And I'm trying to remember
who it was.

132
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:44,069
Mm-hmm.
Who wasn't there last week?

133
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:48,674
Debbie Brown.
And which day was that?

134
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:51,543
Wednesday the 11th.
Perfect.

135
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:54,179
The only difference between me
and a homeless man is this job.

136
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:56,715
I will do whatever it takes
to survive.

137
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:59,851
Like I did...
when I was a homeless man.

138
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,487
Look, I know the reason
that you guys became accountants

139
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:04,389
is 'cause you're not good
at interacting with people.

140
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:05,724
But guess what?

141
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:07,659
From now on,
you guys are no longer losers.

142
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:09,861
So give yourselves
a round of applause.

143
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:13,265
I wonder how many
phone calls you're missing

144
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:15,267
while you're teaching us
to answer calls.

145
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,635
I know, right?
Probably a lot.

146
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:17,836
Can you just tell us

147
00:06:17,838 --> 00:06:19,004
what we need to do so we can go?

148
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:21,606
Okay, Angela.
I love your enthusiasm.

149
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,809
All you need to know how to do
is pick up the phone and say,

150
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,577
"Customer Service.
This is Kelly."

151
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,612
Except don't say Kelly.
Say your own name.

152
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:29,648
Or, if you're bored,
you can just make up a name.

153
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,416
Like one time
I said I was Bridget Jones,

154
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,884
and I talked like this

155
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,419
for the whole conversation.

156
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:35,420
Ooh, can I be...

157
00:06:35,422 --> 00:06:36,722
Australian, mate?

158
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:37,923
Absolutely!

159
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,825
'Ello, mate.

160
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:42,494
I like ice cream.
I need a boyfriend.

161
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,596
I like ice cream, too, mate.

162
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,698
Alli-gators

163
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,800
and dingo babies.

164
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:52,471
Beer me.

165
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:53,705
What's that?

166
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:56,041
Hand me that water.
I always say, "Beer me."

167
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:58,377
Gets a laugh, like,
a quarter of the time.

168
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:59,878
So how's what's-her-name?

169
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,546
You know her name.

170
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:02,814
Who, Karen?

171
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:04,750
Yeah, she's only one of
my oldest friends.

172
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:06,985
Mm. How's the apartment
hanging?

173
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:08,754
It's fine.

174
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:10,756
Nice.

175
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:13,425
Check out this sunshine, man.

176
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,660
Global warming, right?

177
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:18,463
Today was supposed to be
really cold, I bet.

178
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:21,333
What about music?
Do you have any music?

179
00:07:21,335 --> 00:07:23,535
Uh, yeah.
Should have said so.

180
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:41,486
I was thinking
more like a CD or...

181
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,121
a CD?

182
00:07:43,123 --> 00:07:44,589
Your call, dude.

183
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,525
My girlfriend
made an awesome mix.

184
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:47,893
Beer me that disc.

185
00:07:49,962 --> 00:07:51,997
Lord, beer me strength.

186
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,000
So, Tuna, when we get in there,

187
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:56,701
let's do a really
good job, okay?

188
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,770
Did that really need to be said?

189
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:00,906
Well, not everything
a guy says needs to be said.

190
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:04,042
Sometimes it's just about
the music of a conversation.

191
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:06,945
Whoa, what the...

192
00:08:06,947 --> 00:08:08,113
why is my girlfriend here?

193
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,515
Oh, is she that
teacher in the white?

194
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:14,653
No, she's a part-time
frozen yogurt chef.

195
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,588
Which one is she?

196
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,956
The one in the green hoodie.

197
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,858
Wow!

198
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,926
I wonder if she's, like,

199
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:22,794
a guidance counselor
or something?

200
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:23,795
No.

201
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:25,063
I don't think so.

202
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:26,898
- She's probably a tutor.
- Nope.

203
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,166
- She's probably a te...
- No.

204
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:29,501
- She's...
- No.

205
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,506
Okay, press conference in 45.

206
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:36,174
Dwight, make sure
this place looks nice.

207
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:37,509
On it.

208
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:42,514
Okay, Karen, Ryan, Pam.

209
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:45,684
Pam, run a comb
through your hair.

210
00:08:45,686 --> 00:08:47,786
First rule in roadside
beet sales:

211
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:49,788
put the most
attractive beets on top.

212
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,756
The ones that make you pull
the car over and go,

213
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,892
"Wow, I need this beet
right now."

214
00:08:53,894 --> 00:08:55,827
Those are the money beets.

215
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:00,765
Hey!

216
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:01,800
Look sharp.

217
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,435
Hey, uh, hi.

218
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:04,903
Hello.
Dwight Schrute.

219
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:07,205
And you must be, uh,
from The Washington Post.

220
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:08,440
Scranton Times.

221
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:09,975
Chad Lite.
"Lighter Side of Life."

222
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:11,910
And "Breaking
Corporate News."

223
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:13,879
And obits.

224
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,647
Oh, dear God.

225
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,951
You've been granted
level 3 security clearance.

226
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:21,920
Don't get too excited.
That's out of 20.

227
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,522
Right this way.

228
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:24,789
Regional Manager Michael Scott

229
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:26,525
will be addressing the client
in the press room shortly.

230
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,227
Have a seat.
Can I get you a beverage?

231
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:31,062
- Uh, yeah, I'd like a...
- Great.

232
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:35,567
Oh, Andy, you know what?

233
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:37,202
We don't have a lot of time,

234
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,070
so we should probably...

235
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:40,739
- Jamie.
- Andy... oh!

236
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:42,607
- What are you doing here?
- Andy?

237
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:43,642
Are you a student here?

238
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:45,110
Oh... yeah.

239
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:48,947
You never told me
you were in high school.

240
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:51,016
This is weird.

241
00:09:51,018 --> 00:09:53,952
I gotta go to Spanish.

242
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,791
Oh, my God!

243
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:01,526
Oh my God.

244
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,765
I had no idea.

245
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:10,635
Well... that's not gonna
hold up in court.

246
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:12,871
We didn't do anything illegal.

247
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:16,975
Except knock over a mailbox
with her friends.

248
00:10:16,977 --> 00:10:19,177
Sir, yes, you have
a valid point.

249
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:21,179
I'm sorry.

250
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,549
No, I am so sorry.

251
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:25,850
Really?
Dickson City.

252
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,185
Excuse me?

253
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,187
Well, I don't see
how that's our fault.

254
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:32,524
the official position
of Dunder-Mifflin is apologetic.

255
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:34,225
So I don't know
what you want from me.

256
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:38,763
Okay, first I just wanna say

257
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:42,233
that you are doing so good.

258
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:45,003
Look, you have so
many good qualities

259
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,272
that the one that you
might wanna work on

260
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:49,808
is... apologizing?

261
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:54,079
When I went over Wednesday
for the spot check,

262
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:56,181
I got a call from Debbie Brown

263
00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:58,883
saying she has an emergency
dentist appointment.

264
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,919
Emergency dentist appointment.

265
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,655
Now I'm told she told
her manager she had the flu.

266
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:06,324
I'm a trusting guy, but, uh...

267
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:08,293
I just wish
Debbie Brown had been there.

268
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:10,161
We would have caught this.

269
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:14,866
Yes.

270
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,701
I'll be sure someone
returns your call.

271
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:19,070
I'm so sorry.
Bye.

272
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:21,006
Hello. I'm looking
for Michael Scott.

273
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:24,042
Mrs. Allen is our
most important client.

274
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:26,077
Because every client

275
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,179
is our most important client.

276
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:31,616
Even though she's a pretty
unimportant client, really.

277
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:35,286
And so, with the eyes
of the nation upon us,

278
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,355
I would like to say

279
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,924
that Dunder-Mifflin
truly regrets

280
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,793
this unfortunate incident.

281
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,963
And, as a gesture of gratitude

282
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:48,566
for your continued loyalty,
Mrs. Allen,

283
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:52,103
I would like to present you
with this novelty check

284
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:56,274
for six months of free paper,
or 25 reams,

285
00:11:56,276 --> 00:11:58,076
whichever comes first.

286
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:01,179
You look good in this.

287
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:05,250
So... let us consider
this matter ended.

288
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:08,987
Well, it isn't ended.

289
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,022
I'm... I'm very angry.
I could have lost business.

290
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:14,159
I know.
I know you're angry.

291
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:17,028
And we are truly, truly sorry.

292
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,631
I don't accept your apology.

293
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:21,399
The watermark was obscene
and horrifying.

294
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,735
Well...

295
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:25,837
we are extremely sorry.

296
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,539
I don't accept.

297
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:34,179
I'll be with you in a moment.

298
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:36,247
Alright.

299
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:42,854
Who was that guy she was talking
to... at here locker?

300
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:45,090
Not important. Because you're
not dating her.

301
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:47,092
Because it's a felony.

302
00:12:47,094 --> 00:12:49,194
But who was that guy?

303
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:52,230
Probably another high school
student.

304
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:57,702
The issue with the watermark is
very serious.

305
00:12:57,704 --> 00:13:00,371
We teach our students that
character counts.

306
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:02,207
And you should.

307
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:05,376
You don't teach it well enough.

308
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,812
One of your students is a bitch.

309
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:11,149
Andy is having a real rough day
today.

310
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:13,918
I wanna take out an ad in your
school yearbook.

311
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,286
Whole page, two words.

312
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:17,122
Good luck.

313
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:19,424
That's not what I had in mind.

314
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:21,426
Ask where he's from.

315
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:23,428
Where are you from?

316
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,163
Ohio? That's nice.

317
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:27,165
So what do you want?

318
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,367
He's upset about the watermark.

319
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:32,070
Now tell him that
it was an unfortunate error,

320
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,205
and we're doing everything
we can do to fix it,

321
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:35,406
and that you're sorry.

322
00:13:35,408 --> 00:13:37,742
It was an unfortunate error.
We're fixing it.

323
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:38,977
And you already got
your money back...

324
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:40,411
And you're sorry.

325
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:41,980
And the company
has already apologized,

326
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:44,949
so you can take that
apology or not.

327
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:49,420
I think he had
Tourette's or something.

328
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:52,724
We are going to do
everything humanly possible

329
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:54,959
to ensure that this
never happens again.

330
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:56,694
Well, it doesn't help.

331
00:13:56,696 --> 00:13:58,229
Because it already
happened to me.

332
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:00,732
The watermark...
it's a one-time thing.

333
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:02,801
I don't care.
It was disgusting!

334
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:04,202
Cartoon characters having sex?

335
00:14:04,204 --> 00:14:07,972
May I point out that the sex
appeared to be consensual.

336
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,974
Both animals were smiling.
- Okay.

337
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:11,509
I grew up on a farm.

338
00:14:11,511 --> 00:14:15,113
I have seen animals having sex
in every position imaginable.

339
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:18,149
Goat on chicken,
chicken on goat.

340
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:20,151
Couple of chickens doing a goat.

341
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,953
Couple of pigs watching.

342
00:14:21,955 --> 00:14:25,056
Whoever drew this
got it exactly right.

343
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:28,126
What... can I do
for you?

344
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:31,062
For starters,
I think that you should resign.

345
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:32,530
Well...

346
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:34,365
Okay. Well...

347
00:14:34,367 --> 00:14:36,901
Um, wasn't really my fault.

348
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:38,970
The guys at the paper
mill... You're the head...

349
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:40,038
It was a guy at the paper mills.
No, no, no.

350
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,042
I'm the head of the company? Yes, and
that makes it your responsibility...

351
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:45,176
No, I'm a regional manager.

352
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:48,313
Okay, this is insane.
You can get out of here.

353
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:50,248
Get out! That's insane. Fine.

354
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,950
We'll give this to somebody
who will appreciate it.

355
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:53,084
It's nontransferable.

356
00:14:53,086 --> 00:14:54,385
Doesn't matter.
Out, please!

357
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,987
I'm calling
the Better Business Bureau.

358
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:58,389
Yeah, well, I'm calling
the Ungrateful Bee-otch Hotline!

359
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:03,595
Did you get all that?

360
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:05,230
Everything.

361
00:15:09,268 --> 00:15:11,069
We gotta do something.

362
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,972
This is spinning
out of control, Pam.

363
00:15:13,974 --> 00:15:15,073
This is just not...

364
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:17,008
It's just The Scranton Times.

365
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,477
No, then Newsweek picks it up.

366
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,846
And then CNN
does a story about it.

367
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:23,781
And then... YouTube
gets a hold of it.

368
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:26,885
I really think the whole thing
is just gonna blow over

369
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,253
in, like, a week or two.

370
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,190
You're right.
It will blow over.

371
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:38,162
But it's not going to take...

372
00:15:38,164 --> 00:15:39,898
a week or two.

373
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,066
Do you know what this is for?

374
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,102
Yes.

375
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:46,738
Michael likes me
to run the camera

376
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,640
when he makes
his apology videos.

377
00:15:48,642 --> 00:15:51,910
He says he needs
a woman's touch.

378
00:16:02,288 --> 00:16:04,455
Okay, I think that's good.

379
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,424
"Hello, I am Michael Scott,

380
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:08,826
"Regional Manager
of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton.

381
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:12,163
"By now, you are probably
sick of hearing about

382
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:15,700
"Dunder-Mifflin and our
embarrassing watermark boner.

383
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:19,170
"Let me tell you something.
Something from the heart.

384
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:22,740
"I am not leaving this office.

385
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,575
"It will take a SWAT team

386
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:26,611
"to remove me from this office,

387
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:28,446
and maybe not even that."

388
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:30,014
Uh, you could never
withstand a SWAT team.

389
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:33,451
That's how devoted I am
to this job.

390
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:34,752
- I'm just saying.
- I know.

391
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:36,721
They would flank you,
throw in a concussion grenade.

392
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:38,623
I understand that, Dwight.
- You'd be on the ground...

393
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,024
Do you think
you're taking it a little...

394
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:42,093
literally, Dwight?

395
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:43,227
And now we're wasting tape.

396
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:44,829
I'm gonna have
to cut this all out.

397
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:45,964
Can you say "cut"...
- Cut.

398
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:47,999
So I know where to...
- Cut.

399
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,567
I'm asking Pam to do it, please.

400
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:51,636
Cut.
Okay, ready?

401
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:54,672
Kevin, what's four plus seven?

402
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:56,774
Eleven.

403
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:58,142
Yeah, well, you didn't know that

404
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:00,878
when you filled out
this payroll form.

405
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,848
Yeah, well, at least I didn't
suck at customer relations.

406
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,750
Ooh, yes!

407
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:06,784
Facial!

408
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:07,752
Yes.

409
00:17:07,754 --> 00:17:09,587
You two are apes.

410
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,223
I expect you to apologize
for that, Angela.

411
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:14,092
I'm sorry.

412
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:16,627
That you're both morons.

413
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:18,062
But you still said,
"I'm sorry."

414
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:19,697
I called you morons.
Still said it.

415
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:21,299
Still said it, so...

416
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,776
Five, four, three.

417
00:17:31,778 --> 00:17:34,045
"There is no way

418
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:35,980
"I will resign.

419
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:37,281
"It wouldn't be fair.

420
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:39,117
"Not to the good workers
I work with,

421
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,819
"not to my clients,

422
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:43,821
"and especially not to me.

423
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,356
"Let's not forget

424
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:49,660
"who this whole resigning
business is about, anyway.

425
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:52,296
"If I could leave you
with one thought,

426
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,799
"remember... it wasn't me.

427
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:57,802
"They're trying to make me
an escape goat.

428
00:17:57,804 --> 00:18:01,139
"If I am fired, I swear to God

429
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:04,909
"that every single piece
of copier paper in this town

430
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:08,813
"is going to have
the F-word on it.

431
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:11,049
The F-word."

432
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,851
You have one day.

433
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:16,154
One day for what?

434
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,890
That's... they always
give an ultimatum.

435
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:20,758
Okay.

436
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,093
Good? Cut.

437
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:24,062
Cut.

438
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:26,597
That was your best
apology video ever.

439
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,066
I thought so too.

440
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:30,201
Got a farewell card
for Debbie Brown.

441
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:31,803
I thought maybe
you'd like to sign it.

442
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,704
Maybe throw a couple
of bucks in there for her.

443
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:35,073
She's got some children.

444
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:36,908
I feel terrible
about Debbie Brown.

445
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,843
She got fired because of Dwight.

446
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:41,879
So I thought I'd pass around
a good-bye card.

447
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,981
Maybe everyone could put in
a couple of bucks

448
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:46,784
to help her through
these difficult times.

449
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:50,188
Why do bad things always happen
to the good people?

450
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:53,925
It's tragic.
Just tragic.

451
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:00,431
You want music?

452
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,700
I don't care.

453
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:04,368
Come on, man.
Just give it a couple days.

454
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,204
I think you'll be all right.

455
00:19:06,206 --> 00:19:07,738
Yeah.

456
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,220
You know what?
I-I don't...

457
00:19:44,344 --> 00:19:45,843
Sweet.

458
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,292
Pam?

459
00:20:01,294 --> 00:20:03,794
Hey, Dwight.

460
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:05,863
You look really nice today.

461
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:07,832
Psh!
I look like an idiot.

462
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:10,468
Hey, Karen.

463
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,936
Hey, Dwight.
Lookin' sharp.

464
00:20:11,938 --> 00:20:13,838
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm...

465
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,973
your boyfriend, Jim Halpert.

466
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:17,875
Hey, Karen,

467
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:22,313
and have sexual intercourse,
'cause you're my girlfriend?

468
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:23,881
- Do you?
- No.

469
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:25,750
- Okay.
- I'm good. Thanks.

470
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,891
Look at that.

471
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:35,626
I'm Jim Halpert.

472
00:20:37,329 --> 00:20:39,163
Spot on.

473
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:41,065
Blah, blah, a little comment.

474
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,133
Yeah.
