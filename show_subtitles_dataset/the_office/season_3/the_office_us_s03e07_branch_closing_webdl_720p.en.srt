1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,203
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:06,405
Who are you faxing so early
in the morning?

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:07,740
Oh, um...

4
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,943
Kinda hard to explain.

5
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,645
I don't have a ton of contact

6
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,613
with the Scranton branch,

7
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:15,714
but before I left,

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,384
I took a box
of Dwight's stationery.

9
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:22,121
So from time to time,
I send Dwight faxes.

10
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,956
From himself.

11
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,991
From the future.

12
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,293
"Dwight,

13
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:30,229
"At 8:00 A.M. today,
someone poisons the coffee.

14
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:32,264
"Do not drink the coffee.

15
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,200
"More instructions will follow.

16
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,502
"Cordially, Future Dwight"

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,109
Nooo!

18
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,111
You'll thank me later.

19
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,046
There she is.

20
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,248
- Jan Levinson.
- Michael.

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,249
First thing in the morning.

22
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,184
I love to start my day

23
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:27,386
with a hearty bowl of Jan.

24
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,055
- Michael.
- Just call me Levinson.

25
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,891
In the morning.

26
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:33,993
Baby.

27
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:36,061
- Michael.
- Yes.

28
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,766
I'm here to tell you
that we are closing

29
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,301
the Scranton branch.

30
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,205
I don't understand.

31
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,240
The board voted last night
to close your branch.

32
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,777
On whom's authority?

33
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,779
The board's.

34
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,516
W-what?

35
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,218
I'm very sorry.
I-I... pssh.

36
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,252
I don't relish

37
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,954
telling you this.

38
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,790
Uh, you've been a big part
of this company.

39
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,026
And the board asked me
to thank you

40
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:09,428
for your years of service.

41
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,729
You're welcome.

42
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:11,897
A small number of people
will be transferred

43
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,232
to the Stamford branch,

44
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,267
and the rest will be getting
severance packages.

45
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,272
Am I a small number person
or a severance package person?

46
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,640
Well, we haven't made

47
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:26,011
final decisions
about personnel yet.

48
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,179
But you're a severance
package person.

49
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,517
Oh, my God.

50
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,553
Oh, my God!

51
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,524
No!

52
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,630
What are they talking about?

53
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,398
I don't know.

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,033
Is it serious?

55
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,969
I don't know, Kev.

56
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,137
If you find out anything...

57
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,175
Call me.

58
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:59,278
You got it, buddy.

59
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,456
You all right, Michael?

60
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,791
Do you want me
to get you some water

61
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,560
or a tissue?

62
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,097
All right.

63
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,431
You know what, I don't get it.

64
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,901
I don't...

65
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,105
I don't get it.

66
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:27,606
Because our numbers
aren't that bad.

67
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,974
Things are looking up.

68
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,609
It's not all
about numbers, Michael.

69
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,311
- Well...
- It's... it's about talent.

70
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,446
Oh, you gotta...
Josh?

71
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,015
Our CFO believes

72
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,117
- that Josh is going to play an important role...
- Josh.

73
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,118
In our company's future.

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,519
Oh, really?
What role is that?

75
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,988
- Yes, really.
- King of the stupid universe?

76
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,023
Okay.

77
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,090
Don't do this...

78
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,725
I... I think
we're finished.

79
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,793
And I need to go...

80
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,228
We are not...

81
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,164
I would appreciate it if you
would please use discretion

82
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,432
until we get our ducks in a row.

83
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,501
I know you're mad,
but don't do this to me.

84
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,270
I know...
I know I hurt you.

85
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,905
But please do not do this to me.

86
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,407
Don't hurt me like I hurt you.

87
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,444
Jan.

88
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:07,179
Jan.

89
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,051
It is an outrage.

90
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,318
That's all.

91
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,753
It's...

92
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,390
They're making a huge,
huge mistake.

93
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,293
Let's see Josh
replace these people.

94
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:25,364
Let's see Josh
find another Stanley.

95
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,899
You think Stanleys
grow on trees?

96
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,333
Well, they don't.

97
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,668
There is no Stanley tree.

98
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,973
Do you think the world
is crawling with Phyllises?

99
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,443
Show me that farm.

100
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:40,179
With Phyllises and Kevins
sprouting up

101
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,748
all over the place,
ripe for the plucking.

102
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,087
Show me that farm.

103
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,156
Pictures.

104
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,992
Memories.

105
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,094
Look at that.

106
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:55,828
They grow up so fast.

107
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,300
Hey, stranger.
Don't say that.

108
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,302
That just sounds weird.
Please.

109
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,804
Sorry, I just feel like
we haven't talked in a while.

110
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,474
Well, we have nothing
to talk about, Dwight.

111
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,576
Just do your work.

112
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:11,877
While you still can.

113
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,189
When you become close
with someone,

114
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:26,492
you develop a kind
of sixth sense.

115
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,894
You can read their moods
like a book.

116
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,929
Right now, the title
of Michael's book

117
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:35,067
is Something Weird Is Going On.

118
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,002
Colon:

119
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,071
What Did Jan Say?

120
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,876
The Michael Scott Story.

121
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,644
By Michael Scott.

122
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,446
With Dwight Schrute.

123
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,581
Hey, um, did you hear
about your friends

124
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,350
in Pennsylvania?

125
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,352
Rumor has it that
the Scranton branch is "gklch."

126
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,554
Really?

127
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,788
Wow, that's too bad.

128
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,357
Um...

129
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,358
Sorry.

130
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,860
Scranton branch is closing?

131
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,029
In your face.

132
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,265
Well, I work here now.

133
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,200
Mmmm! Sucka.

134
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,475
Are you okay?
D... Yeah.

135
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,377
Great, amazing.

136
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,345
Best physical condition
of my life.

137
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,147
What did Jan want?

138
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,917
Nothing.
Just checking in.

139
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,253
I can't tell you, so.

140
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,488
What can't you tell me?

141
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,924
Nothing.
Pam.

142
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:33,192
What difference does it make?

143
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,359
We'll all be gone
in a few weeks anyway.

144
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,961
- What?
- What?

145
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,362
You just said
that we're gonna be gone...

146
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,163
Do I have any messages?

147
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:39,198
Michael, what's going on?

148
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,399
What did Jan say to you?

149
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,667
- Nothing.
- Was she mean to you?

150
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,001
No, she...

151
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,136
Okay.
Okay.

152
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,704
Listen up, everybody.

153
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,673
I have some news.

154
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,145
All I can do right now
is put on a brave face

155
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,214
and go out there
and be their leader.

156
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:58,317
It's over.

157
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,919
We are screwed.

158
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,121
Dunder-Mifflin Scranton
is being shut down.

159
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,257
Michael, uh...

160
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,325
We shouldn't be talking
about this

161
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,227
until all the decisions
have been made.

162
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,097
You knew about this
all along, didn't you?

163
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,434
Jan told me just a few minutes
before she told you.

164
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:16,868
Traitor.

165
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,103
You are a traitor.

166
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,738
What about us, Michael?
Do we still have jobs?

167
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,739
I don't know.

168
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,675
Probably not.

169
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,877
This is the worst.

170
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:37,122
So this has been great.

171
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,423
So let's get back to work

172
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,492
and do the best job that we can.

173
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:43,428
Toby, I'd like to see you
in my office, please.

174
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,264
All right.

175
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,570
Oh, my God, you walk so slowly.

176
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,413
It makes perfect sense
that it would happen today

177
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,483
because I just received this
in the mail.

178
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,584
1,000 business cards

179
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,053
with this address
and phone number.

180
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:11,089
I don't want to blame anyone
in particular.

181
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,091
I think everyone's to blame.

182
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,028
If I get to stay
and Ryan is laid off,

183
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,163
I will kill myself.

184
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,365
Like Romeo and Juliet.

185
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,800
The Claire Danes one.

186
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,974
What happened?

187
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,109
I think the word got out
about Scranton.

188
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:33,312
Hm...

189
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:35,580
Hey, uh, do you know
any more details on that?

190
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,216
Like, is, uh,
anybody transferring here?

191
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,785
Yeah, nothing's definite.

192
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,086
In fact, you know what.

193
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,088
Um, excuse me, everyone.

194
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,023
I know there are
some rumors going around,

195
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,292
but nothing is definite,
all right?

196
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:49,294
Um, you guys
have done a great job

197
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,263
getting our numbers up
around here,

198
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,764
but until this thing
is official,

199
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,932
let's just keep working.

200
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,634
Huh, yeah?
Be professional.

201
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,735
Ladies and gentlemen,

202
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,504
our fearless leader,
Josh Porter.

203
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,707
Josh, take a bow.
Take a bow.

204
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,376
I think
it would be kind of weird

205
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,578
if everyone from Scranton
came here.

206
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,246
It'd be like, uh,

207
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,848
going to
your high school reunion,

208
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,450
and you saying,
"Hey, I missed you guys."

209
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,118
And then they're all like,
"Oh, don't worry about it.

210
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,721
"We're all
gonna move in with you...

211
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,089
forever."

212
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,362
Yeah?

213
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,363
Hey.

214
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,031
Meredith, hello.

215
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,032
Tough day.

216
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,233
Yes.

217
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,267
So listen,

218
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,936
I know you're seeing someone,

219
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,772
but I'm still willing
if you are.

220
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,174
What... willing?

221
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,476
You remember.

222
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,978
Like six years ago we said
that on our last day of work

223
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,314
that we would...

224
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,582
sleep together.

225
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:46,084
Oh...

226
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,254
God, uh,

227
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,523
um, I did not say that.

228
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,792
Was that not you?

229
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,094
No, not... not me.

230
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,563
Oh.

231
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,632
Never mind.

232
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,637
Day just gets worse and worse.

233
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,939
It's a blessing in disguise.

234
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,575
Actually, not even in disguise.

235
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,010
In my fantasy,

236
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,745
I always thought
I would slap someone,

237
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:17,749
make a big speech
and storm out forever.

238
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,584
But this is good too.

239
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,653
- You're kidding.
- No.

240
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,255
Wh... What does that mean?

241
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:25,724
Well, some of us are fired.

242
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:28,727
And a few are going
to Connecticut.

243
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:32,297
Do you guys know
who's going where?

244
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,600
Oh, don't worry.
You're gonna be fine, Roy.

245
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:37,002
You're very... strong.

246
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,303
And capable.

247
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,838
Thanks.

248
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,975
Oh, grow up.

249
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,645
I don't wanna work here
without Pam.

250
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,813
That'd just be like

251
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,315
loading trucks
without any meaning.

252
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,650
You know?

253
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,585
I couldn't be happier.

254
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,353
I'm gonna take the severance
and retire.

255
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,489
My wife and I are gonna travel.

256
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,192
I really couldn't be happier.

257
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,663
Feeling nostalgic?

258
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,199
Yeah, nostalgic.

259
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,180
- Hey, Mike.
- Darrel.

260
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,215
Noble Darrel.

261
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,385
- Look, I heard about the office.
- Oh.

262
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,386
- Tough break.
- I know.

263
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,888
I know.

264
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,989
Well, I'll land on my feet.

265
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,724
Yeah.
Don't worry about me.

266
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,059
I wasn't.

267
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,360
So you'll be okay too.

268
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,863
You're a warrior.
You're smart, capable.

269
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,764
You'll find something else,
and...

270
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,467
Actually, Bob Vance bought out
the warehouse.

271
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,802
So he's keeping on
the whole crew.

272
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,870
So we're good.

273
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,373
Awesome.

274
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,375
This is my house.

275
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,078
The CFO's taking away my house
and giving it to Josh.

276
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,516
And Josh is giving the garage
to Bob Vance.

277
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,852
Pah.

278
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,188
All right, listen up.

279
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,489
Some of you may have heard

280
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:07,025
some rumors
about the branch closing.

281
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,561
Um, like when you said
the branch was closing?

282
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,096
But I am not

283
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,064
going to take this lying down.

284
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,132
I have a plan,

285
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,433
and I am going to save our jobs.

286
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,902
So just hang in there.
Let's go.

287
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,370
Yes!

288
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:19,771
Oh, good.
You're bringing Dwight.

289
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,473
Yes.
This might get ugly.

290
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,542
I'm gonna need backup.

291
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,377
What's the plan?

292
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:26,411
Go to New York.

293
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,946
Confront the CFO.

294
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,915
Show him he's making a mistake.
Save the branch.

295
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,683
- Can I drive?
- No way.

296
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:32,684
Shotgun!

297
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,019
No, there's no one else.

298
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,654
Still.

299
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,556
Thank you very much.
Okay.

300
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:39,724
- Secretary says Wallace is away for the day...
- Agh.

301
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,826
And won't be coming back
into the office.

302
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,461
Okay, okay.
Um...

303
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,696
But...

304
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:45,964
do not worry.

305
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,632
I have his home address...

306
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,568
right here.

307
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,835
Why?

308
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,470
Christmas card list.

309
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,805
You send him cards?

310
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:54,973
You've never met him.

311
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,041
Well, when I do,

312
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,909
we'll have something
to talk about.

313
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,780
Hey, do you have a second?

314
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,415
Sure, what's up?

315
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,250
I-I know it's not definite,
or whatever,

316
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,719
but, uh, do you know
who's coming over here

317
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,120
from Scranton?

318
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,322
I honestly don't.
I don't know.

319
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,523
Okay.

320
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:14,225
So is it, like, sales
or... accountants or...

321
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,061
You know what, Jim?
I wouldn't worry about it.

322
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,063
What does that mean?

323
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,564
- Hi.
- Jan, hey.

324
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,132
Oh, good, you're both here.

325
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,601
Ready to talk logistics?

326
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,238
I just feel like it could have
been something special

327
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,407
if we could have kept
working together.

328
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,942
But...

329
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:31,943
I'm gonna go someplace else,

330
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,913
and you're gonna go
someplace else.

331
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,648
It just doesn't make sense.

332
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,117
This kind of worked out
perfectly for me.

333
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,885
I got some good experience.

334
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,322
Um, Michael's gonna write me
a great recommendation.

335
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,259
And as far as
me and Kelly goes...

336
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,395
I think it's for the best.

337
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,639
Okay.

338
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,841
This is it.

339
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,210
This is exactly
what Michael Moore does.

340
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,812
Famous documentarian.

341
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,181
He goes up to people
with a camera,

342
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,349
and he's like,

343
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,651
"Why did you do this?

344
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:13,918
"Why did you pollute?

345
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,087
You are bad.
You're a bad person."

346
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,122
It's very dramatic.

347
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:18,390
Although I can't say
I was a big fan

348
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,225
of Bowling For Columbine.

349
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,559
Because I thought it
was gonna be

350
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,694
a bowling movie.

351
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,362
Like Kingpin.

352
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,503
And it wasn't.
It was something else.

353
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,073
So.

354
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,242
Josh will be running
what is now called

355
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,877
Dunder-Mifflin Northeast,

356
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,979
which is all the offices
north of Stamford.

357
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,247
And Jim, if you want the job,

358
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,982
you'll be his number two.

359
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,750
Wow. Uh, sure.
Absolutely.

360
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:46,951
- Awesome. - 'Scuse me, Jan.
I'm sorry.

361
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,119
I'm gonna have
to stop you there.

362
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,555
I, um...

363
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,457
will not be taking the job.

364
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,491
W...

365
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,526
Excu... why not?

366
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,362
As of today, I have accepted

367
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,931
a senior management position
at Staples.

368
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,533
Today.

369
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:02,867
Mm-hmm.

370
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,602
You leveraged your new position
with us

371
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:05,737
into another offer?

372
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,372
Damn it, Josh.

373
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,109
This whole restructuring thing
was based around keeping you.

374
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,377
I...

375
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,079
I'm sorry, all right?
It's done.

376
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,080
It's done.

377
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,347
I gotta make some calls.

378
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,215
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, Jim.

379
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,321
Say what you will
about Michael Scott.

380
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,858
But he would never do that.

381
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,626
Okay.

382
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,628
All visible
points of access are covered.

383
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,564
So.

384
00:15:32,566 --> 00:15:34,032
Do you know
what you're gonna say

385
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,333
when he shows up?

386
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,601
I will improvise.

387
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,736
I will speak from the heart.

388
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:39,304
No.
Bad idea.

389
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,206
You need an attack plan.

390
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,141
Here, I'll be him.
You be you.

391
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,142
Let's practice.

392
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,844
Okay.

393
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:46,978
All right.

394
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,348
- Coming home from work.
- 'Scuse me.

395
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,649
Mr. Wallace?
David Wallace?

396
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,951
Yes?
What is the meaning of this?

397
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,888
Can you tell us why
you are shutting down Scranton

398
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,457
and putting 15 people
out of work?

399
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,793
Well, the branch is no longer
financially viable.

400
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,294
It's simple dollars and cents.

401
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,463
Yes, but these
are employees, sir.

402
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,464
These are human beings.

403
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,766
Listen, Scott.

404
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:09,734
It's no longer
financially viable.

405
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,069
We're losing money, okay?

406
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,004
It's not a charity.
It's a business.

407
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,939
And it's a dying business.

408
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:18,143
Look, the whole business model

409
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,444
of the small regional
paper company

410
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,578
simply doesn't
make sense anymore.

411
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,880
Stop... stop it.
Just...

412
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:23,148
Okay, he's not gonna say
any of that.

413
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,482
It...
Wh... hey, why not?

414
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,518
Because he'd be intimidated.
And I just...

415
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,652
Let's start again.

416
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,721
- Just be more scared of me, okay?
- Okay.

417
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,623
Don't touch me this time.

418
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:34,325
- Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
- Coming home from w... Agh!

419
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,795
Pam, would you please sign
my company directory?

420
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,997
Are you serious?

421
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,532
Sure.

422
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,310
"Kelly, best wishes.
Love, Pam"?

423
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,547
"P.S.

424
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,516
What a long, strange trip
it's been."

425
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,895
So we are still scrambling
here, but, uh...

426
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,063
Mm-hmm?

427
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,966
It looks like Scranton
is going to absorb Stamford.

428
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:16,000
Wow.

429
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,836
And I know that you
just left there

430
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,103
couple of months ago,

431
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,105
but we would like to offer you
the number two position

432
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,140
at that branch.

433
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,408
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

434
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,342
Um...

435
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:27,145
No, it's just,
I'm not sure if I, um...

436
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,713
Well, to be quite honest
with you, Jan,

437
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,149
I-I have a few unpleasant
memories of Scranton.

438
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,351
And, um...

439
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,385
Michael.

440
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,553
No, no, no.

441
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,323
Just, um, some personal stuff.

442
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,658
And I'm not really ready
to revisit that,

443
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,960
I don't think.

444
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:43,394
Ah.

445
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,296
Well.

446
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,464
Please think about it.

447
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,699
And call me.

448
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,500
We will do whatever we can
to get you to stay.

449
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,835
Okay.

450
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,377
Hey, Meredith,
how you holding up?

451
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,678
I'm fine.

452
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,280
Hey, did we
ever have a conversation

453
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,349
about doing something
on the last day of work?

454
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,817
Does that ring a bell?

455
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,752
No, I don't think so.

456
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,387
Do you remember
hearing a rumor about me

457
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,123
and anybody, last day of work?

458
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,192
Something sexual?

459
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,394
No.

460
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:18,463
Okay.

461
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,101
I'm kind of
okay with it actually.

462
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,739
Oh, that's good.
That's... That's great.

463
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:30,208
Um, do you know
what you're gonna do then?

464
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,311
Well, you know,
I've got art school.

465
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,545
Oh, that's...

466
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,015
Yeah, of course,
you should totally do that.

467
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,349
That's a great idea.

468
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,952
Yeah, um...

469
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,421
I am already.

470
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,424
I started a while ago.

471
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:50,895
Wow, that's...
that's terrific.

472
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,798
That's awesome.

473
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,834
Well, cool.

474
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,269
I'm glad you're doing that.

475
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:04,342
You can learn a great deal about
a man from his trash.

476
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,946
Case in point:

477
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:10,014
Satellite TV bill.

478
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:11,449
Hm, lesson learned:

479
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,451
He's rich.

480
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,454
Hm...

481
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,523
Coffee grounds.

482
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,592
Was he enjoying
a delicious hot beverage?

483
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:25,096
Or disguising
the scent of cocaine

484
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:29,033
from drug-sniffing dogs?

485
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,236
It's a nice house.

486
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,805
Hey, guys.

487
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,640
Uh, I'm trying to organize
a little group lunch

488
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,475
for everybody, since, you know,

489
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,310
we're never gonna see
each other again.

490
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,979
Where are we going?

491
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,747
I thought maybe DJ's?

492
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:43,781
Mmm...

493
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,149
How 'bout Cugino's?

494
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,385
I don't wanna go
all the way to Dunmore.

495
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,220
How 'bout Cooper's, then?

496
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,521
No seafood.

497
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,358
Well, I don't want
to go to DJ's.

498
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,159
Oh, now, all of a sudden,
you get picky?

499
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,762
Okay.
Forget it.

500
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,164
Hooters.

501
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,532
No.

502
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,668
400 for the CPU.

503
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,803
Done.

504
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,281
Ah!
Here.

505
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:20,284
Replenish your fluids.

506
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,427
Where's Michael?

507
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,095
He's not here.

508
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,097
I don't know where he is.

509
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,565
What d...

510
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,769
What's going on here?

511
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,804
We know the branch is closing.

512
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,205
Michael told us.

513
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,707
Oh, God.

514
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,143
Okay.
You know what, everybody?

515
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:47,145
I'm sure there is
a better way to do this,

516
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,080
but I've driven something
like 400 miles today,

517
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,448
and I'm completely exhausted.

518
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,449
So I'm just gonna tell you.

519
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,051
Your branch is not closing.

520
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,085
Stamford is closing.

521
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,788
Um, for the time being, it seems

522
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,456
that all of your jobs are safe.

523
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,457
Yes.

524
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,725
Yeah!

525
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,126
Stanley.

526
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,227
Is it because of Michael?

527
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,263
Did he actually do something?

528
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,266
Well, reasons are not important.

529
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,934
Would you just call him, please,
wherever he is,

530
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:10,935
and tell him?

531
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,470
Sure.
Uh, Jan.

532
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,105
Um, do you know... is anyone
coming back to Scranton?

533
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,339
Back?

534
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,707
Coming to Scranton.

535
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,742
Is anyone coming to Scranton?

536
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,178
Uh, y... we don't know.

537
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,447
Probably a few.

538
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,722
Maybe we should take a break,

539
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,124
get some food.

540
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,992
Negative.
We could miss him.

541
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:36,160
I'm really hungry.

542
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,299
Who is it?

543
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,400
The office.

544
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,202
- Are you gonna get it?
- No.

545
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:49,307
Not until I have
some good news for them.

546
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,542
Not until I have some good news.

547
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,846
Bulum-bulum-bump-
Belum-bump.

548
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,681
Dunder-Mifflin Action News.

549
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,983
Jim Halpert,

550
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,319
will Big Tuna
be transferring to Scranton?

551
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,488
Oh, I don't know.

552
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,722
Jan offered me the job,

553
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,691
and I haven't
really decided yet.

554
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,226
Yeah, well, even if
I don't get transferred,

555
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:11,329
I'll probably be fine.

556
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:15,700
Cornell has an extensive
alumni network so...

557
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,636
We look out for each other.

558
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:20,404
Probably go back
and teach or something.

559
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,006
Where'd you go to college?

560
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,675
Hm, Cornell.

561
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,844
Oh...

562
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,346
That's good.

563
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,484
I guess some new people
might be coming from Stamford.

564
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:36,254
Should be fun.
New blood.

565
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:37,622
Is Jim coming back?

566
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,757
That's, um...

567
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,392
I hadn't thought about it.

568
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,161
I don't know.
Huh.

569
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:44,428
I just don't want it
to be weird.

570
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,531
You know?

571
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,565
I mean,

572
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:48,933
I took his old job

573
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,268
and his old desk.

574
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,103
Yeah, yeah, that might be weird.

575
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:55,173
Overall, though,

576
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:57,041
we still all have our jobs,
so good news, right?

577
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:57,708
Oh, yeah.
Totally.

578
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,545
I'm so happy!

579
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,446
We don't have
to break up now, Ryan!

580
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,048
Mm, mm, mm!

581
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,416
It is the best day
of my whole life.

582
00:23:05,418 --> 00:23:09,687
I don't know.

583
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,522
I can't explain it.

584
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,164
What are you gonna do?

585
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,633
I really don't know.

586
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,801
How you doing with all this?

587
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,736
You know, I'm fine.

588
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,272
I'll be better when I know
if I have a job.

589
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,042
You'd actually move to Scranton?

590
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:32,343
Yeah, if they let me.

591
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:33,644
I think I...
I think I would.

592
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:37,415
New York City is 45 minutes
down the road from here.

593
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,750
And you wanna move to Scranton.

594
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,219
I don't know.

595
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:43,054
If I were you,
I'd move to New York.

596
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,624
Yeah, you know, I...
I might do that.

597
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:47,758
I mi... who knows?

598
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,094
I... I might do that.

599
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,967
Guh!
K-k-kah!

600
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,073
Hey, Andy.

601
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,074
What's up, Josh?

602
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:04,242
Hey, man, just wanted
to say thanks.

603
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,243
Good luck.

604
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:06,244
Thanks, man.
You, too.

605
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:07,311
Totally.

606
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,182
Oh, well, what can you do?

607
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:12,950
It was nice
to have those few hours

608
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,151
when I thought it was over.

609
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:19,056
Now I have something
to look forward to.

610
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:21,459
Hey, Creed, congratulations.

611
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,460
Thank you.

612
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:25,896
Made like 1,200 bucks.

613
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:26,931
Meredith Palmer.

614
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:28,132
Hey, gorgeous.

615
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,433
Who's this?

616
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,402
Gary Trendel, from the old days.

617
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:32,503
Worked in the warehouse.

618
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:33,771
Oh, hey.

619
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,506
Hey, yeah, listen,
I heard through the grapevine

620
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:36,941
that your branch is closing,

621
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:40,278
and it got me to thinking
about our deal, remember?

622
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,546
Oh, yes.

623
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,850
Well, actually, the branch is...

624
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:47,985
Can you be at my place
in 20 minutes?

625
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,322
Yes, I can.

626
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,089
Anything?

627
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,593
Nothing.

628
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,895
What if this doesn't work?

629
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,898
What if the office
actually goes under?

630
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,536
Then it was an honor
to have worked with you.

631
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,315
All right.

632
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:22,119
Favorite moments
in Dunder-Mifflin history.

633
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,120
Go.

634
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,290
My first day, when you hazed me

635
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,492
by spraying me
with a fire extinguisher.

636
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,997
That was hilarious.

637
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,465
The foam.

638
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,702
Um, my first sale.
Uh-huh.

639
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,905
My promotion to assistant
regional manager.

640
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,340
Our basketball game.

641
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:43,641
Uh-huh.

642
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,678
And when you took me
to the hospital...

643
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,814
and told me
that you cared about me.

644
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,149
Oh, right. Okay.

645
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,851
That's enough.
That's good.

646
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,455
What were your favorite moments?

647
00:25:57,457 --> 00:26:00,024
Oh...

648
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,892
All of 'em.

649
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,561
I loved 'em all.

650
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,796
Every single one.

651
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,033
What about when Jan said
the branch was closing?

652
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,201
God, Dwight.

653
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:12,336
Well, I just...

654
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,905
Hey, Pam.

655
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,073
We're going to Poor Richard's.

656
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,575
Creed's buying shots.

657
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,809
No, thanks, guys.

658
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:19,910
- All right.
- Have fun, though.

659
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,911
Cool.

660
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,646
Hey, I hear Jim's coming back.

661
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,515
Really?
Where did you hear that?

662
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:26,117
- Well, I was...
- Hey, Ryan, you coming?

663
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,184
Uh, yeah, we'll meet you there.

664
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,053
Awesome.
Let's go.

665
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:30,121
I'll tell you later.

666
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:31,522
Okay.

667
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,593
Hi.

668
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,430
Crazy day, huh?

669
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:41,432
Yeah.
Yeah.

670
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:42,800
Man.

671
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,571
I'm, uh...

672
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:50,341
I'm really glad you're still
gonna be working here.

673
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:53,544
Yeah, me, too.

674
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:55,012
I mean, it'd...

675
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:57,648
It's be a pain to have
to find another job so...

676
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,983
Yeah.

677
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,786
Totally.

678
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,424
All right, I'll see ya.

679
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,325
Okay.

680
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,161
I was expecting a severance.

681
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:13,297
Some time off.

682
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,166
But, um, maybe this is good.

683
00:27:15,168 --> 00:27:17,535
Finding another job is a pain.

684
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:20,004
There's another annoying boss,

685
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,238
another desk.

686
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,542
I'd have to learn everything
all over again.

687
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,510
So...

688
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:29,313
there are reasons to stay.

689
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,723
Hey, um...

690
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,126
I think I am
gonna take that job.

691
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,127
And...

692
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:45,062
Scranton?

693
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,230
It's not that bad.

694
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:51,101
So if they offer you
a job there...

695
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,269
I think you should take it.

696
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,039
Okay, yeah.
Maybe I will.

697
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,174
Okay.

698
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,609
Yeah, I'm...
I'm happy he said that.

699
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:01,212
I mean, I don't think
he's into me or anything.

700
00:28:01,214 --> 00:28:02,746
But...

701
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,049
I'm kind of into him.

702
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,117
So... there you go.

703
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:16,660
What are we still doing here?

704
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:19,430
It's over.

705
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:20,564
Let's go home.

706
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:22,299
Get the car.

707
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:29,507
Ohhh, this was such
a stupid idea.

708
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:32,543
This was so stupid.

709
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,479
I'm such a stupid idiot.

710
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,814
I let everybody down.

711
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,616
Everybody hates me.

712
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:42,286
I lost everybody's jobs.

713
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,255
Nobody likes me anymore!

714
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:45,256
Oh, my God!

715
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:46,390
What?

716
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,758
Stamford is closed!

717
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,994
Michael, we're not closed.

718
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:51,529
Stamford is closed!

719
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:52,530
Stamford is closed!
We did it?

720
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:54,431
We did it!
We did it!

721
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,267
We did it!

722
00:28:56,269 --> 00:28:58,168
Yaaahhhh!
We did it!

723
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,238
We did it!
Yeah!

724
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,706
We did it!

725
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,108
Yeah!
Right here, right here.

726
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,977
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

727
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,879
Ho, ho, ho, ho, hoooo!

728
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:09,980
Yeah, baby!

729
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,550
In your face!

730
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:13,551
We did it.

731
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:14,952
Oh, man.

732
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:17,388
How did we do it?

733
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,522
I don't know.
I have no idea.

734
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,591
I don't understand.

735
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,093
Well, for a minute there,
I saw myself

736
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,995
selling my house,
moving to Costa Rica,

737
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,031
learning how to surf.

738
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,600
But Costa Rica
will still be there...

739
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,371
when I'm 65.
