1
00:00:00,851 --> 00:00:02,351
Jim, could you
come in here, please?

2
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:10,259
Hi, Jim.

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,260
Hello.

4
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:14,029
I am Harvey, a computer.

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,866
Jim sucks.

6
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:18,767
Sorry.
Zing.

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,069
Oh, wow.

8
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:21,670
That's so rude.

9
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,172
I'm sorry, I can't control him.

10
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:24,440
Yeah, you can.

11
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:26,208
You know what? Get Pam.
For this?

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,843
Pam.

13
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:33,515
Pam, you look very hot today.

14
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:36,752
Pam, meet Harvey.

15
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,153
This is Michael's new friend.
Great.

16
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:41,290
Me so horny.
Me love you long tim.

17
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,291
Whoa.

18
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,426
Oh, that is gross!

19
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:45,694
Who is "Long Tim"?

20
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:47,329
Damn it.

21
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:50,900
Long time.

22
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:52,134
Me love you a long time.

23
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,470
Oh, well, Yoy should
bring Long Tim in one day.

24
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,838
I'd love to meet Long Tim.

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,373
Yeah, right?
Yeah.

26
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,908
You ruined a funny joke.

27
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,210
You get out
of my off-five.

28
00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:03,279
Okay.
Okay.

29
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:04,346
Bye, Harvey.

30
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:10,452
Boobs.

31
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:40,082
Angela.
What?

32
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:43,018
That was a voice mail
that corporate left last night.

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,720
They did not get our tax forms.

34
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:47,456
Did you send them?

35
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,124
They arrived this morning.

36
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:50,659
Are you sure?

37
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:52,461
It is a big deal.

38
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:54,997
Is it a big deal?
Is it, Kevin?

39
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,767
Do you really not know?

40
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,636
Because it is a big deal.

41
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:04,707
Five of us transferred
from Stamford.

42
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:05,808
There's two of us left.

43
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,277
Me and Karen.

44
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:11,180
It's like we're touring
Willy Wonka's chocolate factory,

45
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:13,782
and dropping off one by one.

46
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,751
Well, guess what.

47
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:18,420
I'm not falling
in a chocolate river.

48
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,595
Everything okay?

49
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,464
Just fine.

50
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,631
You are in the clear.

51
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,066
Thank you.

52
00:02:36,806 --> 00:02:38,941
I don't...
I don't want those.

53
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:42,311
Dwight,

54
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:43,779
care to join us, finally?

55
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:45,814
Thank you.

56
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:48,150
Hey, Dwight,
pass the tardy sauce.

57
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:49,318
Get it, Michael?

58
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,285
Yes.

59
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:53,689
Okay, here is the dream team.

60
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:55,624
My sales dream team.

61
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:57,526
Today we are going to
team up for sales calls.

62
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:59,928
Andy, since this was your idea,

63
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,929
you get to pick first.

64
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,232
Hmm, well,

65
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,768
let me think about this
for a minute.

66
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,871
Oh, I don't know...
Michael Scott.

67
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,506
Oh.
PhD.

68
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:12,541
Doctor of sales.

69
00:03:12,543 --> 00:03:13,675
Well, I appreciate that.

70
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:14,710
That's very gracious of you.

71
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:17,112
Well it is very gracious
of you to accept.

72
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,381
Well, thank you, sir.

73
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:22,284
Okay, now going by seniority,

74
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,453
Phyllis, our resident senior.

75
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,989
We're the same age.

76
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,024
And I'll pick Karen.

77
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,493
Oh, uh, thanks.

78
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:33,328
Good.

79
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,697
Next up, the Super Fly himself,

80
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,698
Stanley.

81
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,766
Pass.

82
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:40,269
You can't pass.
You gotta pick somebody.

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,175
I'll take the kid.

84
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,810
I'm very flattered.

85
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:51,013
I was his second choice,
after "pass."

86
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:53,715
So that just leaves
Dwight and Jim.

87
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:55,517
Okay, wait, does anyone
want to trade?

88
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,153
Yeah, I'll trade.

89
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,322
Dwight and I used to
go on sales calls all the time.

90
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:04,059
In fact, I have a picture
to remember that time.

91
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,727
Oh, young Jim.

92
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,631
There's just so much
I need to warn you about.

93
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:14,570
And yet, tragically, I cannot.

94
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,872
Sebring, by Chrysler.

95
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:19,608
A heck of a motor carriage.

96
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,711
Dwight, here ya go!

97
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:23,979
Yeah!

98
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,714
You want shirts on hangers?
Please.

99
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:26,915
He does your laundry?

100
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:29,585
Long story.

101
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:30,752
All right, everybody, circle up.

102
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:33,255
Here we go.

103
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,890
You know that this is?

104
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:36,458
This is the Amazing Race.

105
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,694
And you guys are
the retired marines.

106
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:41,430
And you guys are
the mother/daughter.

107
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:43,265
And you guys are the gay couple.

108
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:45,234
And we are
the firefighter heroes.

109
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:46,635
Are we ready to go?

110
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:50,239
Wait, Amazing Race, like,
the biggest sale wins?

111
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:51,874
No, we're just gonna rush out,

112
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,275
do the sales thing,
and come back.

113
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:54,443
Is there a prize?

114
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:55,644
Just bragging rights.

115
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:57,045
Then how is this Amazing Race?

116
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,680
It's just... brrrrr.

117
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,416
It's Amazing Race,
Phyllis, okay?

118
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,785
We're in teams of two,
and we are on a mission.

119
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:06,321
All right, so, on your mark,

120
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,356
get set, go.

121
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:09,291
Let's do it.
Come on!

122
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:15,831
Michael...
Whoa, whoa.

123
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,466
Oh, ho ho ho!

124
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,501
Vamanos.
Bueno.

125
00:05:19,503 --> 00:05:22,604
Do you have a pole?

126
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:24,072
Let's go get a broom.

127
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,742
Seriously, you're gonna sit
in the back?

128
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,943
Uh, yeah.

129
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:29,444
It's the safest part of a car.

130
00:05:29,446 --> 00:05:30,712
In the event of a crash,

131
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:33,415
the driver always
protects his side first.

132
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,922
Here we go.
Whoo!

133
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,323
In order to take down Dwight,

134
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:43,058
I have to chip away at his ally.

135
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,193
In this case, Michael.

136
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:46,061
And here's the good news.

137
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:47,963
Every success I've ever had,

138
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:50,799
in my job, or with
the lady folk,

139
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,768
has come from my ability

140
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,770
to slowly and painfully

141
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:57,940
wear someone down.

142
00:05:57,942 --> 00:05:59,808
What's the deal with Dwight
doing your laundry?

143
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,445
That is a long story.

144
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,982
Um, a couple months ago,

145
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:09,751
Dwight tried to
go behind my back with Jan

146
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,887
and get my job.

147
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:14,823
And I am now having him
do my laundry as punishment.

148
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:17,859
Wow, that is a long story,

149
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:20,095
but quite well told, Michael.

150
00:06:20,097 --> 00:06:22,130
I find it very interesting.

151
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,966
Especially the part about Dwight

152
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,567
going behind your back,

153
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:30,038
and basically being,
like, a terrible person.

154
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,874
You know, if you want
your laundry done right,

155
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,676
I used to work at Abercrombie.

156
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:37,613
So... pretty good folder.

157
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:40,983
Why are we turning in here?

158
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,284
This is a beauty salon.

159
00:06:42,286 --> 00:06:44,419
Mm-hmm.

160
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:46,355
Hey, do you mind
if I take the lead

161
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:47,356
on this one?

162
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:48,957
And then, you can
critique me after.

163
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,592
You want the lead?

164
00:06:50,594 --> 00:06:51,960
Yeah, if you don't mind.

165
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:53,195
Mind?

166
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:54,963
Nothing would delight me more.

167
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,706
Hey, Pam, would you like
to go with me

168
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:05,707
to grab a coffee?

169
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,743
Really?

170
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:08,877
Yeah.

171
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,212
I thought you could use
some fresh air.

172
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,880
It might be fun.

173
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:13,715
Okay, sure.

174
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:15,083
Okay.

175
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,592
Leave the keys.

176
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:25,060
You still do that thing?

177
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:26,995
Leave the keys.

178
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:47,849
I think that you have assembled

179
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,385
an amazing team in Scranton.

180
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,020
It's really a pleasure
to be a part of it.

181
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,456
It's like everyone has
their own special skill.

182
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,125
You know, just like
the Super Friends.

183
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,760
Except for Dwight,

184
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,363
who's kind of more of
a super dud.

185
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,265
I mean, he'd be a Super Friend,

186
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,801
if there was a Super Friend
whose super power was

187
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:07,269
always being late.

188
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:09,705
You know?

189
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:12,574
Hawkman.

190
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:16,611
My plan is taking longer
than I thought.

191
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:19,147
But I don't give up easily.

192
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,451
I have walked
two marathons, so...

193
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,954
Let's go.

194
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,926
The men's room was disgusting.

195
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,330
After you, sir.

196
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,365
No, thank you.

197
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:37,466
I never let anyone
walk behind me.

198
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:39,301
Seven out of ten attacks
are from the rear.

199
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:40,635
Okay, well, that still leaves

200
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:42,704
a 30% chance that I'll
attack you from the front.

201
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,639
Yeah, but it'll be
easier to stop.

202
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,141
I can always block the blow.

203
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,176
Or I can counter...

204
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,419
Hey, did you catch that

205
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,920
up in Lake Wallenpaupack?

206
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,155
Yep.

207
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:01,857
You know, I used to
go up there all the time

208
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:02,924
with my stepdad,

209
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:04,659
and I never caught
anything that big.

210
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:08,830
I caught an 80-pound shark
off Montauk.

211
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:10,599
It's in the Hamptons.
Uh-huh.

212
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:13,068
My dad's got
a 42-foot Bayliner.

213
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,471
Sniped it with a rifle
from the crow's nest.

214
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,307
Also shot a deer once.

215
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,809
You know what?
Let's get right down to it.

216
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:25,013
Dunder-Mifflin may be
just two rooms and a warehouse,

217
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,381
but what we lack in flash,

218
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:30,318
we will make up for
with hard work and decency...

219
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,155
Okay, this is
the classic undersell.

220
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,891
Because you should know

221
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:37,392
we don't work
out of a log cabin.

222
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:39,394
We trade on the New York
Stock Exchange.

223
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:41,830
Ever heard of it?
It's in New York.

224
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,599
I have to say I'm a little wary

225
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:46,435
of getting involved
with a big company.

226
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:48,236
We've had some problems
in the past.

227
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:52,207
I think what Andy
is trying to express is that

228
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,476
while we have the resources
of a large company,

229
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:56,445
we will give you
the care and attention

230
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:57,946
of a small company.

231
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:00,615
Man, that is like poetry.

232
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:01,850
No.

233
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,418
I swear, this guy
could sell paper to a tree.

234
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,719
No, stop it.
Stop.

235
00:10:04,721 --> 00:10:06,354
Ow.

236
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:12,394
Oh, man, talk about
your classic lame-dash-o.

237
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:15,430
Do we even want that guy
buying our paper?

238
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:17,699
Yes.

239
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:20,035
Angela, you seem so happy.

240
00:10:21,604 --> 00:10:24,573
I bet you wish you were
like this all the time.

241
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:29,344
This friend of mine...
let's call her Noelle.

242
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:32,214
She missed this deadline

243
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,749
turning something in
to corporate in New York.

244
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,853
But then this gallant
gentleman...

245
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:38,887
we'll call him Curt.

246
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,722
He drove all the way to New York

247
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,591
and handed it in for her.

248
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:45,060
Because... I don't know.

249
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,329
I guess he just
really likes her a lot.

250
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:49,631
Well, that's great.

251
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,466
Yes, it is.

252
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:57,439
Hello?

253
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:00,575
I'm...
I'm so sorry, man.

254
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,479
I really screwed that up.

255
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:05,814
Oh...
Really... no.

256
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:06,815
Don't worry about it.

257
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:07,916
I really Schruted it.

258
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:09,484
What?

259
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:10,852
Schruted it.

260
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,522
It just this thing people say
around your office all the time.

261
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:15,156
Like when you screw something up

262
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,392
in a really irreversible way,

263
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:19,561
you Schruted it.

264
00:11:19,563 --> 00:11:21,963
I don't know where
it comes from, though.

265
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:23,932
You think it comes
from Dwight Schrute?

266
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,367
I don't know.

267
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:28,203
Who knows how words are formed?

268
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,907
That's a big order.
Thanks, Ken.

269
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:32,908
Yeah, thank you.

270
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,009
Hey, how's Annie?

271
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,477
Oh, she's great.

272
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:40,048
This is us last year in Bermuda.

273
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,551
Lovely place.

274
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,052
You ever been to Bermuda?

275
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:45,453
Stanley Hudson.

276
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,289
Ah, Julius.
How's it going?

277
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,357
Great, great,
great, great, great.

278
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:50,792
Stanley, so good to see you.

279
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,127
You too.

280
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,229
I'd like you fellas
to meet Ryan Howard.

281
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:55,564
Hi.

282
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,566
I'm gonna let Ryan
do a little pitch for you

283
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:58,934
while I do my crossword puzzle.

284
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,135
Ryan?

285
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,541
Um...

286
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:09,544
Hi.

287
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:10,946
Hi.

288
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,414
Hi.

289
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,782
Hello, Ryan.
Hi.

290
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:16,518
What do you have for us?

291
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,053
Oh...

292
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:19,521
We can offer
our biggest discounts

293
00:12:19,523 --> 00:12:22,157
on 30% recycled,
and ultra-premium laser.

294
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,325
Okay.
Okay.

295
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,060
Can I use your phone?

296
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:26,761
Yeah, sure, go ahead.
Thanks.

297
00:12:26,763 --> 00:12:27,963
Let me talk to you about
a few of the other things

298
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:29,164
we can offer.

299
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,932
Namely, we know
the tax season's coming up.

300
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,767
So by April 1st,
we can have you fully stocked.

301
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:34,035
One...

302
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:35,036
Discount prices
on ink cartridges.

303
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:36,204
Three...

304
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,772
And also any forms
that you're gonna need,

305
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:40,875
Seven. We can custom make them.

306
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,183
And you just said,
"Hi. Hi. Hi."

307
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:51,953
You sounded like...

308
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,789
My niece.

309
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,792
And she's six months old.

310
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:00,962
I appreciate what
you guys are saying,

311
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:02,163
but it makes more fiscal sense

312
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:03,498
to go with one of the big guys.

313
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,566
Sure.
That's true.

314
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:05,634
We can't compete
with their prices.

315
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:06,668
But let me ask you something.

316
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,737
How important to you
is customer service?

317
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:10,238
Very.

318
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,272
Please keep holding.

319
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:13,008
Your call is
very important to us.

320
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,110
That's one
of the "big guys."

321
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:16,811
Been on hold this whole time.

322
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,347
And this is
Dunder-Mifflin.

323
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:22,217
Dunder-Mifflin
customer service.

324
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,985
This is Kelly.
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim.

325
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:26,388
Oh, my God, Jim, how are you?

326
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,989
Here's my card.

327
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:29,824
It's got my cell number,
my pager number,

328
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:31,793
my home number,
and my other pager number.

329
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:33,662
I never take vacations,
I never get sick,

330
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:35,230
and I don't celebrate
any major holidays.

331
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,232
All right, I get it.

332
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,733
We got a deal.

333
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:39,868
All right.

334
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,169
Thanks, that was fun.

335
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:42,270
Yeah.

336
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:43,772
I really enjoy
spending time with you.

337
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,106
You're a very nice person.

338
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:46,207
Thank you.

339
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,510
And I'm so glad you're with Jim.

340
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:52,147
He was hung up on Pam
for such a long time.

341
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:54,849
I didn't think
he'd ever get over her.

342
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,655
That's nice.

343
00:14:00,657 --> 00:14:05,060
You can pay me back later
for the makeover.

344
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,266
Whew!

345
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,600
Hey, boss.

346
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,503
- Got a minute?
- Yes, Andy.

347
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,839
I forget, why did Dwight say
he was late this morning?

348
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:18,840
He didn't say.

349
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:20,075
That's weird.

350
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:21,810
Because I was just walking
past his desk,

351
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:24,779
and I saw this, which is
a toll booth receipt

352
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,481
from New York City,

353
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:30,552
stamped really early
this morning.

354
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:32,520
Why would Dwight go to New York

355
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:35,090
without telling anyone?

356
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:36,491
You think he went to see Jan?

357
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:38,593
That's not like him.

358
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,695
Is it?

359
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:42,931
Someone told me a story
about this,

360
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:47,502
with, like, laundry
and betrayal.

361
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:49,537
Did you betray Dwight,

362
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:51,873
and try to steal his job
or something?

363
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:56,177
No, you are
remembering it wrong.

364
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,546
Dwight betrayed me once before.

365
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:01,516
So this is his strike two.

366
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:03,351
You know what they say.

367
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:05,687
Fool me once, strike one.

368
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:09,557
But fool me twice...

369
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,127
strike three.

370
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,297
I like Karen.
She's pretty.

371
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,767
Appears intelligent.

372
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:21,002
Well, I like pretty women

373
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,506
who have the appearance
of intelligence.

374
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,308
My girlfriend is also
beautiful and smart.

375
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,079
She could be a model,
or a college professor

376
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:34,282
which is intimidating
to a lot of guys.

377
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:36,417
We should go on a double date.

378
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:39,554
No, thank you.

379
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,290
Dwight's name is on
the security sign-in sheet,

380
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:45,393
but I don't know
who he met with.

381
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:47,462
And where it asks you
to state your business,

382
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:49,664
he wrote
"Beeswax Not Yours, Inc."

383
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,765
I knew it.

384
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:57,372
Oooooh, doggy.

385
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,706
Hey,

386
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,208
you wanna grab a coffee?

387
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,210
Sure.

388
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,978
Look at you.

389
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,581
Yeah.

390
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,386
Hey, we nailed the sale.

391
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,521
Where were you this morning?

392
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,890
I overslept.
Damn rooster didn't crow.

393
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,193
Why do you lie, liar?

394
00:16:18,195 --> 00:16:19,227
I am not a liar.

395
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:20,695
You are lying right now.

396
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:21,996
Sure seems like he's lying.

397
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:23,698
Stay out of this, you.

398
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,567
I know that you went
to corporate this morning.

399
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,937
And I know that you lied
about it.

400
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:30,738
And given our history...

401
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,508
I need you to tell me right now

402
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,144
exactly what you were doing
this morning.

403
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:39,347
Michael, I cannot tell you
what I was doing there.

404
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:40,782
But you have to trust me.

405
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:42,750
I would never do anything
to hurt you

406
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,018
or this company.

407
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,153
Okay, you know what?

408
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,721
I want you to think
about your future

409
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:47,822
at this company.

410
00:16:47,824 --> 00:16:49,958
I want you to think about it
long and hard.

411
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,959
That's what she said.

412
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:52,227
Don't you dare.

413
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,765
I want to know what
you were doing this morning

414
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,734
by the end of the day.

415
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,108
It's gonna be okay.

416
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,377
How's it gonna be okay, Dwight?

417
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,312
Everyone will know our business.

418
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,781
That's not the worst thing
in the world.

419
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,017
I'll just stand up
in front of the office,

420
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:18,853
and reveal our true love.

421
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,622
It won't be that bad.

422
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,323
Look at Kelly and Ryan.

423
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,858
I hate those two people

424
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,693
more than anything
in the entire world.

425
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,465
Well, I don't have
a lot of choices.

426
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,533
So let me ask you a question.

427
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:33,735
Okay.

428
00:17:33,737 --> 00:17:35,837
Did you ever have a thing
for Pam?

429
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,839
Pam?

430
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:40,141
Did I ever have a thing for her?

431
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,876
No.

432
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,545
Why, did she say something?

433
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:47,548
I moved here from Connecticut.

434
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,284
Yeah...

435
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:53,521
Okay, here's the...

436
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:57,325
I had... a crush on her

437
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,694
before I left.

438
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:00,828
And I told her about it,

439
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,031
and she didn't feel
the same way.

440
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,666
So it didn't amount to anything,

441
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,567
and I left.

442
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:12,040
I'm really glad you're here.

443
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,142
Okay?

444
00:18:14,144 --> 00:18:16,744
Okay.

445
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:21,182
Ahem.

446
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:25,353
May I have
your attention, please?

447
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:29,223
This will only take a moment
of your time.

448
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:30,992
Although I love this company

449
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:32,593
more than almost
anything in the world,

450
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,363
I have decided
to step down from my post

451
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,165
and spend more time
with my family.

452
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,467
I do not fear the unknown.

453
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:41,436
I will meet my new challenges
head on,

454
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:43,004
and I will succeed.

455
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:45,773
And I will laugh in the faces
of those who doubt me.

456
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:48,776
It's been a pleasure
working with some of you,

457
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:51,012
and I will not forget
those of you soon.

458
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:54,015
But remember,
while today it is me,

459
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:57,518
we all shall fall.

460
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,358
In other words, I'm quitting.

461
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,959
So...

462
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,250
I would like to give
the rest of my belongings...

463
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,485
to Michael Scott.

464
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,521
Just take it.

465
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:34,822
Except this.

466
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:36,457
Good luck.

467
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:38,726
And this one.
Oops.

468
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,431
Dwight will be missed.

469
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,267
Not by me... so much.

470
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,070
But he will be missed.

471
00:19:49,072 --> 00:19:52,540
Dwight... from sales...

472
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:55,243
was one of the most honorable
and efficient employees

473
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:57,612
this company has ever had.

474
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:00,214
One of my life goals
was to die right here,

475
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:02,383
in my desk chair.

476
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:09,857
And today,
that dream was shattered.

477
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:11,259
Hey, man.

478
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,841
What happened
on your sales call?

479
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:32,613
Um, am I happy about
the way things turned out?

480
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:36,851
Well, happy's such an ugly word.

481
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:40,321
But I saw what needed
to be done,

482
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,489
and I did it.

483
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,091
And now I'm thrilled.

484
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:45,059
So it's pretty...

485
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,328
Hello?

486
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,063
Pretty good.
