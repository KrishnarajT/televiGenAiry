1
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:05,928
Brain teaser.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,996
I have two coins
totaling 15 cents.

3
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:09,832
One of them is not a nickel.
What are they?

4
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:10,899
A dime and a nickel.

5
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:13,402
No, I said one of them
is not a nickel...

6
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:14,636
But the other one is.

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:15,838
I've heard that before.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,741
Okay, a man and his son
get into a car accident.

9
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:21,276
They are rushed to the hospital.

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:22,544
The doctor says,

11
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:24,012
"There's no way I can
operate on this boy."

12
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:25,314
"Because he's my son."

13
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,915
The doctor is the boy's mother.

14
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,451
A man is found hanging
from the ceiling.

15
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:30,886
He stepped on a block of ice,
hung himself,

16
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:32,888
and the ice melted.

17
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,690
A hunter...

18
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:35,691
It's a polar bear because
you're at the North Pole.

19
00:00:35,693 --> 00:00:37,092
Damn it!

20
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:11,660
Tell me what you did yesterday.

21
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,662
Uh, nothing.

22
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:15,597
- Nothing?
- Yeah, nothing.

23
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,798
How was your day?

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,233
I don't care
how your day was, Michael.

25
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:20,435
Wow.

26
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:22,004
Well, okay.

27
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:24,039
I don't care how
your day was either, Jan.

28
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:26,041
I was just asking you
because you asked me.

29
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:28,210
Tell me what you did yesterday.

30
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:29,611
I worked.

31
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:32,214
And then I went home
to my condo.

32
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:33,715
And Carol came over.

33
00:01:33,717 --> 00:01:35,884
And we had sex.

34
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:38,253
Is that what you want to hear?

35
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:41,557
Never, ever, ever sleep
with your boss.

36
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,058
I'm so lucky that Jan and I

37
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,760
only got to second base.

38
00:01:44,762 --> 00:01:45,928
Hi, Pam.

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,162
- Hi.
- I'm great.

40
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:49,398
So, Pam, I'd like you to keep

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,700
a log of everything
Michael does hour by hour

42
00:01:51,702 --> 00:01:52,901
so that we can analyze it
at corporate, okay?

43
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:54,970
Oh, I don't know...
Thanks, Pam.

44
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,906
It's weird.

45
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:59,241
Jan used to treat Michael

46
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,842
like he was a 10-year-old.

47
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:03,011
But lately it's like he's five.

48
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:04,880
So, are you excited?

49
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:06,381
Yeah.

50
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:08,617
Very excited?

51
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,453
Yes, I'm very excited.

52
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:13,255
Extremely excited?

53
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,192
Just very...
That's cool.

54
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,461
I have spent a year here.

55
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:24,199
And I have to commit
or get out, so...

56
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:26,034
Dwight's the top salesman
in the company,

57
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:28,470
and he's taking me on
my first sales call today.

58
00:02:28,472 --> 00:02:31,206
And, um, I'm excited.

59
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:35,444
I am very excited.
Ryan hasn't made a sale yet.

60
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:39,881
But more importantly,
he hasn't made an ally yet.

61
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:42,284
Is he gonna be a slacker-
loser-wise-ass like Jim was,

62
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:45,921
or is he gonna join
the Dwight Army of Champions?

63
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:47,656
So, what if
they're not talking much?

64
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:50,892
Then does it make sense to
kind of lead the conversation?

65
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:52,728
You know, just until it gets
to a point where

66
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,530
they are asking questions?

67
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:05,807
So, where's the sales office?

68
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:07,743
When you are ready
to see the sales office,

69
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:10,145
the sales office will
present itself to you.

70
00:03:11,581 --> 00:03:14,883
Your journey begins now.

71
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:22,057
Hey.

72
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:23,859
What?

73
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,861
My chair's squeaking.

74
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:26,895
Is it?

75
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:28,363
You took my chair.

76
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:30,666
No, I didn't.

77
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,334
I took back the chair
that you took from me.

78
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:33,635
But I didn't take your chair.

79
00:03:33,637 --> 00:03:34,870
When you get up,

80
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:37,105
I'm just gonna take it back
anyway, so...

81
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,608
So I guess I can't get up.

82
00:03:56,092 --> 00:03:57,726
Hey, Coselli!

83
00:03:57,728 --> 00:04:00,028
The Coz!
The Cosby.

84
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,663
Hey, hey, hey!

85
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:04,399
I love Jell-O Pudding Pops!

86
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:08,670
My son Theo love
Jell-O Pudding Pops too.

87
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:11,473
Do you know where we are, Temp?

88
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:13,108
I know where we're not.

89
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,345
I hold in my hand a beet seed.

90
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:18,613
Take it.

91
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:19,614
Ah...

92
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:20,682
When you...

93
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:23,385
Damn it.

94
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:29,257
Hey, Big Tuna.

95
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,625
Can I talk to you for a second?

96
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:31,893
Sure.

97
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,829
Can you stand up

98
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:36,164
and talk to me over there?

99
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:40,635
That's it?

100
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:41,937
That's what you came up with?

101
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,406
I'm acting my heart out here.

102
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:46,441
- Really, huh?
- Yeah, really.

103
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,744
You asked for my help,
so I helped.

104
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:56,385
Attention, Scranton
Business Park.

105
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:57,853
There will be
complimentary pretzels

106
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:01,289
available in the lobby
from now until 4:00

107
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,725
as a thank-you
to our loyal tenants.

108
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:12,434
Once a year, they bring in
a little cart.

109
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,269
And they give away
free pretzels.

110
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:17,272
It's really not a big deal.

111
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,974
To some people it is.

112
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:20,542
Productivity is important.

113
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:22,577
But how can I be productive

114
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:24,246
if I have this one little
thing in my brain

115
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,881
that I cannot get out?

116
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,483
And that one little thing
is a soft pretzel.

117
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,218
So I'm just gonna have
my soft pretzel.

118
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,219
And I'll get to work.

119
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:32,621
And I'll be super productive.

120
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,722
Look out for me!

121
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:37,192
Oh, sh...

122
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:38,860
Come on.

123
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:51,907
And just as you have planted
your seed in the ground,

124
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:55,010
I am going to plant my seed
in you.

125
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:57,446
I don't think you know
what you're saying.

126
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:59,014
Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?

127
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,749
Uh-huh.

128
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,384
It's called bullcrap.

129
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,853
And a client can smell it
from a mile away.

130
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:06,588
Gotcha.

131
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,589
Oh, hey...

132
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:08,990
I forgot something in my car.

133
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:10,525
I'll be right back.

134
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,160
Okay.

135
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,142
Of course.

136
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:32,414
I wake up every morning
in a bed that's too small.

137
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,649
Drive my daughter to a school
that's too expensive.

138
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:36,351
And then I go to work to a job

139
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,220
for which I get paid too little.

140
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:40,889
But on pretzel day...

141
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:43,792
Well, I like pretzel day.

142
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:45,393
'Cause they're acting
all tough and everything.

143
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:47,362
But what they were
rapping about was cupcakes

144
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:48,697
and The Chronicles of Narnia.

145
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,999
Who invented cupcakes, right?

146
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,133
- I want to kill them.
- Hey!

147
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:53,201
Hey, Phyllis!

148
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,402
What are you doing?

149
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:55,837
I'm just saying hi to Bob.

150
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,472
No, I think you're
cutting in line.

151
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:58,940
Well, settle down, Scott.

152
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:00,442
No, I'm not gonna settle down.
No, no way.

153
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:01,877
- Uh-uh, boo!
- Get in the back, please.

154
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,379
- Boo!
- Back of the line!

155
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:05,614
Thank you!

156
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:07,382
Back of the line.

157
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:09,618
That's right.

158
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,186
What a pair of Marys.

159
00:07:11,188 --> 00:07:12,954
This is pretzel day.

160
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:13,955
"Hey, Dwight,
you're a great salesman.

161
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:14,956
Can you teach me?"

162
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,124
"Sure, Ryan.

163
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:17,459
"I'll make you kneel
in cow manure.

164
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,528
And I'll abandon you
in a beet field."

165
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,129
"Oh, that sounds great, Dwight.

166
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,297
"I really appreciate that.

167
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:25,400
Thank you so much
for your mentorship."

168
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:32,908
Congratulations,
resourceful salesman.

169
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,844
You have passed
the second challenge.

170
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:38,613
Welcome to Schrute Farm!

171
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:02,137
It's gonna be
in my head all day.

172
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,305
Please?

173
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,877
This is not
a proportionate response.

174
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:25,293
Whatever happened to those guys?

175
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:29,364
Michael.

176
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:30,398
No cuts!

177
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,733
Oh, Pam.

178
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,068
Just the woman I'd like to see.

179
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,069
You read my mind.

180
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,103
Great.

181
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:36,671
I thought you might want
to use this time

182
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:37,772
to authorize some checks.

183
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:39,074
I thought that maybe you could

184
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:40,575
wait in line for me
while I go to the bathroom.

185
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:41,876
You're an angel.

186
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:43,812
Hey, why don't you just
go up to your office,

187
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,846
get some work done,

188
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:45,880
and I'll bring you a pretzel?

189
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:47,515
Because I like them
a certain way.

190
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:48,817
And if it gets screwed up,

191
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,785
then this whole thing's blown.

192
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:52,487
You know, I just think it's
really important that

193
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:53,989
you be productive today.

194
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:56,224
Pam, productivity starts with

195
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:58,426
patience and determination.

196
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:00,195
Okay.

197
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,504
It is time for your next test.

198
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,640
You have planted the beet seed.

199
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:14,442
You have walked the long,
lonely walk of loneliness.

200
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:15,443
Look, man.

201
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:16,945
I was in a frat in college.

202
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,680
So I know what you're doing.

203
00:09:18,682 --> 00:09:19,681
I get it.

204
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:20,815
You know what your problem is?

205
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:22,550
You know why you haven't
made any sales?

206
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:23,985
Because you think
you know everything.

207
00:09:23,987 --> 00:09:25,520
You have to trust that maybe

208
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:26,621
there are other people

209
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:28,256
that can teach you things.

210
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:30,759
Are you ready to learn?

211
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:33,762
Are you ready for
the final test?

212
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:34,763
Yeah.

213
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:35,964
Come on!

214
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:41,269
Thank you.

215
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:42,270
Hi, please tell me you have

216
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:43,271
a sweet pretzel left.

217
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:44,973
- We do.
- Thank God.

218
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:46,174
And we have
18 different toppings.

219
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:47,742
We have sweet glaze,
cinnamon sugar,

220
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:49,210
chocolate, white chocolate,

221
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:51,946
fudge, M&Ms, caramel dip,
mint chip, chocolate chip,

222
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:54,282
marshmallows, nuts,
toffee nuts, coconuts,

223
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,751
peanut butter drizzle, Oreos,
sprinkles, cotton candy bits,

224
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:57,786
and powdered sugar.

225
00:09:57,788 --> 00:10:00,555
Is there any way
that you could do all?

226
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,556
All of them?

227
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:02,557
The works?
You got it.

228
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,858
All right!

229
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,193
Thank you.

230
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:08,096
Please be seated.

231
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,437
What was that?

232
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:16,671
Pay no attention to the spirits

233
00:10:16,673 --> 00:10:18,039
that haunt this hallowed ground.

234
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,908
Is that your cousin Mose?

235
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,009
Yes.

236
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:24,479
Mose is my cousin,
and he lives here.

237
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:26,848
He will always be
my best friend.

238
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,516
Unless things go well
with Ryan today.

239
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:29,884
In which case
I won't hang out with Mose

240
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:31,186
so much anymore.

241
00:10:31,188 --> 00:10:35,156
What is the greatest danger
facing Dunder-Mifflin?

242
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:38,226
Outsourcing and consolidation
of competition.

243
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:39,527
Wrong.
Flash floods.

244
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:41,696
What is the true cause

245
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:44,766
of Robert Mifflin's suicide?

246
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:47,135
Depression?

247
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:48,536
Wrong.
He hated himself.

248
00:10:48,538 --> 00:10:52,373
What is the Dharma Initiative?

249
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,542
I can't believe that
Ryan is not back yet.

250
00:10:54,544 --> 00:10:55,543
Where could they be?

251
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,278
Sales take a long time.

252
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,580
Oh, my God.
I'm so worried.

253
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:01,082
I'm sure Dwight
will protect him.

254
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,851
I don't know.
Dwight's so weird.

255
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:05,086
He's not weird.

256
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:06,988
He's just individualistic.

257
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,323
No, he's a freak.

258
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,591
You're a freak!

259
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,163
Final question,

260
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:17,565
young Ryan Howard.

261
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,137
What...

262
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:29,577
is Michael Scott's
greatest fear?

263
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,047
Um, loneliness.

264
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,582
Maybe women.

265
00:11:34,584 --> 00:11:35,917
Wrong.

266
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,153
He's not afraid of anything.

267
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,588
Also, I would've accepted
snakes.

268
00:11:41,724 --> 00:11:43,892
Fear is what it's all about.

269
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:47,495
You cannot sell
while undergoing fear.

270
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:50,131
You need to vanquish fear!

271
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:55,170
One must wrestle fear
to the ground.

272
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,305
You will now
wrestle my cousin Mose!

273
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:59,274
No!
Okay, all right!

274
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:00,508
Wrestle him to the ground!

275
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,576
This is over, okay?

276
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:02,710
You're a freak.

277
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:04,312
I'm not doing this anymore
and this is over.

278
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:05,647
- Ryan...
- Good-bye.

279
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:06,748
Ryan, you don't have
to wrestle him.

280
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,484
Ryan, just get in the coffin.

281
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:12,420
Ryan...

282
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:14,322
Bye, Ryan.

283
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:19,694
He seemed nice.

284
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,596
Where are all the animals?

285
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,700
Ryan, come on.
I am sorry.

286
00:12:25,702 --> 00:12:27,135
I am sorry.

287
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,136
Mose is sorry too.

288
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:29,103
Look...

289
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:32,040
He sent over a basket with eggs

290
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,441
and some fat back bacon.

291
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:34,409
And look...

292
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:37,011
Something he whittled.

293
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,598
You still mad?

294
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,237
It's just...

295
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,272
Jim and I didn't get along.

296
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:08,076
And... I didn't want it
to be that way again.

297
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:11,479
You know, I wanted us
to be a team.

298
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:13,147
An unstoppable team

299
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:14,649
that competed against
other teams.

300
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,718
Look, that's not
what I wanted, okay?

301
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,654
I just wanted
to go on a sales call.

302
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:22,624
Screw gun!
The sales call!

303
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:50,451
Mr. Coselli.

304
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:51,552
Hey, hey, hey!

305
00:13:51,554 --> 00:13:53,554
The Cos!
What's going on?

306
00:13:53,556 --> 00:13:54,722
Do we have a deal?

307
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:56,224
Deal or no deal?

308
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,592
Let's make a deal.

309
00:13:57,594 --> 00:13:59,227
So what is the deal?

310
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,428
Establish time frames.

311
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,897
Keep the phrase "real dollars"
in their heads.

312
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:04,732
And always keep the power
in the conversation.

313
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:06,467
That's why you're losing them
on the cold calls.

314
00:14:06,469 --> 00:14:08,937
Because you say
the word "please" too much.

315
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:10,238
Wait, can you go back?

316
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,106
Michael always says
K-I-S-S.

317
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:13,775
"Keep it simple, stupid."

318
00:14:13,777 --> 00:14:14,909
Great advice.

319
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,744
Hurts my feelings every time.

320
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:19,347
Okay, I'm gonna
establish time frames.

321
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:20,648
Good.

322
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,883
I'm gonna put everything
in terms of real dollars.

323
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:22,951
Right.

324
00:14:22,953 --> 00:14:24,085
I'm gonna ask a lot of questions

325
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,553
that all have sort of
positive answers.

326
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:26,587
So they'll say
"That would be better" or

327
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:27,622
"We would like that."

328
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:28,823
Exactly, yes, good.

329
00:14:28,825 --> 00:14:30,291
I'm going to try to be confident

330
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:31,359
but not cocky.

331
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,929
Oh, hey, everyone.

332
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,998
I am officially streamlining
the efficiency

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,566
of this corporation.

334
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:40,034
- Second...
- Second?

335
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:41,336
Yes, second, Toby.

336
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,105
Second, I am insisting
on increased accountability

337
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:45,306
from every single one of you.

338
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:47,075
Account...
Michael, what's going on?

339
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:48,376
And I will be taking questions.

340
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,211
Did you have a lot of
sugar today, Michael?

341
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:51,379
What's on your suit?

342
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,447
Caramel dip.

343
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:53,648
But one question
at a time, please.

344
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,116
Phyllis, Stanley...

345
00:14:55,118 --> 00:14:56,284
I want you to switch desks.

346
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:57,919
I'm going to reorganize

347
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:59,821
and restructure
the physical layout

348
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:01,422
of the office to
maximize everything.

349
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,491
I think we're getting
a lot done, don't you?

350
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:04,592
On paper, at least.

351
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,494
And we are, after all,
a paper company.

352
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:07,895
Are we not?
Are we not?

353
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:08,930
Are we not?
Are you with me?

354
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:10,898
Are you with me?
Thank you very much.

355
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:14,869
They really didn't like me.

356
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,170
They did not.

357
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:18,373
But they didn't have to
say it to your face.

358
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,874
I don't get it.

359
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:21,809
I don't get what I did wrong.

360
00:15:21,811 --> 00:15:23,478
Not everything's a lesson, Ryan.

361
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,545
Sometimes you just fail.

362
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:26,547
It's those online paper jerks.

363
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,583
The whole business is changing.

364
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:29,617
You know what?

365
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:30,618
They're gonna be screwed

366
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,487
once this whole
Internet fad is over.

367
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:34,322
What are you doing?
Oh, no!

368
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:37,658
No, no, no!
No, Ryan!

369
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,428
Yes!
Ryan the Temp, yeah!

370
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,531
Come on, come on!

371
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:44,532
Courtesy of Dunder-Mifflin!

372
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:45,767
Oh, come on!

373
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:48,936
- Drive!
- You drive!

374
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:53,975
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Pam.

375
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,043
Oh, hi, Jan.

376
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,980
He's, uh, on a sales call.

377
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:00,448
No message?

378
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,117
Bye, Jan.

379
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:17,965
Temp! Temp!

380
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:19,867
Temp! Temp...

381
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:21,769
Ryan! Ryan!

382
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:23,504
Ryan! Ryan!

383
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:24,672
Yes!

384
00:16:24,674 --> 00:16:26,240
Just think.

385
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:27,775
That temp agency
could've sent you anywhere.

386
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:31,112
I think about that all the time.

387
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:36,417
- Good night, Pam.
- Good night.

388
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:37,919
Hey, what time is it?

389
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:39,187
5:20.

390
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:40,188
AM or PM?

391
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,322
PM.

392
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:42,924
Oh, good.

393
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:43,925
These came for you.

394
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:45,326
Contracts.

395
00:16:45,328 --> 00:16:46,327
Brent Coselli.

396
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:49,864
Oh, Coselli.
With the Jell-O.

397
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:51,232
This is a huge sale.

398
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,534
Yes, right.
Good.

399
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,004
Good night, Michael.

400
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:58,673
Good night.

401
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,446
Dunder-Mifflin.

402
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:06,447
Oh, hey.

403
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:07,648
Oh, my God.

404
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,983
Hi.

405
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:10,151
Hi.

406
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:11,786
Sorry, I forgot
Kevin's extension.

407
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:13,387
It's a fantasy football thing.

408
00:17:13,389 --> 00:17:14,589
Oh.

409
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:15,823
And I was just gonna
go through the system

410
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:18,659
because I didn't think
you'd be there.

411
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:20,128
Why are you still there?

412
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,497
I had to work late.

413
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,132
Jan's making me keep a log

414
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,766
of everything Michael does
all day.

415
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:27,969
Wow.

416
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,640
Do you think you could
send me a copy of that?

417
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:34,475
Yeah, totally.

418
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,347
So...
So...

419
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,149
- Do you...
- Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.

420
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:42,917
Uh, no...
I, um...

421
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,119
Everything's pretty much
the same here.

422
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:46,120
Oh, good.

423
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,322
A little different.

424
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:50,525
What time is it there?

425
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:53,528
What time is it here?

426
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:56,964
We're in the same time zone.

427
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:59,600
Oh, yeah.
Right.

428
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:01,602
How far away did you think
we were?

429
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,938
I don't know.
It felt far.

430
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,609
Yeah.

431
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:10,645
- I have a question for you.
- What?

432
00:18:10,647 --> 00:18:12,380
How many words per minute

433
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,315
does the average person type?

434
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:15,416
I type 90.

435
00:18:15,418 --> 00:18:17,151
Shut up.

436
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:18,920
Mavis Beacon doesn't even
type 90.

437
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:20,188
It's true.

438
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,622
Okay, I said average.

439
00:18:21,624 --> 00:18:22,623
70?

440
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:23,624
How many do you type?

441
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:24,759
Forget it.

442
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:26,861
I was just about to brag.
Forget it.

443
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:28,596
- Come on, tell me.
- No.

444
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,131
You have to tell me now.

445
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:31,165
65.

446
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,936
Okay, no need to laugh.

447
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:37,572
No, it's...
That's respectable.

448
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,673
Respectable?

449
00:18:38,675 --> 00:18:41,175
So, okay,
I'm watching the movie.

450
00:18:41,177 --> 00:18:44,011
By myself, because I just wanted

451
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:45,546
a relaxing evening at home.

452
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:48,482
Okay.

453
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:49,650
And I'm freaking out!

454
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:50,685
Yeah.

455
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:51,686
That movie is so scary.

456
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:52,687
I know.

457
00:18:52,689 --> 00:18:54,121
But I'm holding on

458
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,257
because I keep waiting
for Sandra Bullock to show up.

459
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:57,658
No way!

460
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,996
How do you confuse 28 Days
with 28 Days Later?

461
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:03,197
Because I got it at Blockbuster

462
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,665
and they don't put
the pictures on the box.

463
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,001
You're making this up.

464
00:19:07,003 --> 00:19:08,736
Would I make that up?

465
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:10,238
Yes!

466
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Fancy New Beesly
would make that up.

467
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:14,041
New apartment, new stories...

468
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,711
Oh, yeah,
My fancy new apartment.

469
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:20,348
I have one bedroom,
one bathroom, and a closet.

470
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,515
And how many kitchens?

471
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,650
I have one kitchen.

472
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:24,652
Wow, you got totally taken

473
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,187
for a ride, Beesly.

474
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:28,055
It's actually...

475
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:30,558
Most apartments these days
have, like, three.

476
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,559
Three kitchens?

477
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:33,461
Yes.

478
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,629
How are you gonna cook

479
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,063
every meal of the day
in one kitchen?

480
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,598
Hey, Ryan.
Are you okay?

481
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,233
Pam?

482
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:41,168
Yeah. Yeah.

483
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,536
Pam?

484
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:44,338
Um, okay.

485
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,606
Bye.

486
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,642
Oh, yeah.
I should probably...

487
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,143
Oh, no...
I was, um...

488
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,144
I don't know.

489
00:19:50,146 --> 00:19:51,712
- You have to go?
- Yeah.

490
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:52,713
No, I should probably go too.

491
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:53,814
Okay.

492
00:19:53,816 --> 00:19:55,950
I mean, yeah.

493
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:57,018
Yeah.

494
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,988
Bye, Pam.

495
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,391
Bye, Jim.

496
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,386
364 days...
Until the next pretzel day.
