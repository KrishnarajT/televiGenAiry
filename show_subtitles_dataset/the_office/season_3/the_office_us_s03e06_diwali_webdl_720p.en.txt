1
00:00:01,241 --> 00:00:02,742
There you go.

2
00:00:02,744 --> 00:00:03,776
Oh.

3
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:09,615
Nice dress, Ryan.

4
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:12,451
It's not a dress.
It's a kurta.

5
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:13,552
Okay.

6
00:00:13,554 --> 00:00:15,221
Tonight, one of our most

7
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,323
ethnic coworkers, Kelly,

8
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:20,026
has invited us all
to a Diwali celebration

9
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:21,861
put on by her community.

10
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:23,963
What is Diwali, you may ask?

11
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:27,400
Well, to have Kelly explain it,

12
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,634
"It's..."

13
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:32,238
"It's so super, fun.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,173
And it's gonna be great."

15
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:36,342
A lot of gods
with unpronounceable names.

16
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:38,144
20 minutes later, you find out

17
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,746
that it's essentially
a Hindu Halloween.

18
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:42,181
You look so handsome.

19
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:43,215
You really do.

20
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:45,217
I love the material.

21
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,318
I know.

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,553
How come you didn't get me one?

23
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:49,789
I...

24
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:24,356
Okay, so between
Meredith's minivan,

25
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:25,791
and if I borrow Bob's Yukon,

26
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:28,227
that should fit about 12 people.

27
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:29,862
I actually might not go.

28
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:31,597
I'm feeling kind of tired.

29
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,765
Do you wanna make Appletinis

30
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,033
and watch Sex and the City
at my place?

31
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:38,137
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.

32
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,205
I don't get why you won't go.

33
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:40,306
Did I do something wrong?

34
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,874
I mean, I thought we
were really close friends.

35
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,876
I just feel kind of tired,
you know.

36
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:44,977
Maybe you've got mono.

37
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,011
Maybe.

38
00:01:46,013 --> 00:01:47,546
I just...

39
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:49,048
I don't really have
anyone to go with.

40
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,583
Well, go with Dwight.

41
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:52,017
He's single too right?

42
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,385
Yeah, totally single.

43
00:01:53,387 --> 00:01:55,688
100% available.

44
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,058
Are you guys going to this
Indian thing tonight?

45
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,628
I don't know.
Who's, uh, who's going?

46
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,132
Ohh... you mean, like,
is Pam going?

47
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:08,300
Don't go.
They eat monkey brains.

48
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:10,236
Hey, hey, hey, stop that.

49
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,303
That is offensive.

50
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:14,006
Indians do not
eat monkey brains.

51
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,808
And if they do...

52
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,743
sign me up.

53
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:19,678
Because I am sure
that they are very tasty.

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,515
And nutritional.

55
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,819
It's important that this company

56
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:29,855
celebrates its diversity.

57
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:31,924
And you know what, Stanley?

58
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:34,560
Come Kwanzaa time,
I have got you covered, baby.

59
00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:36,362
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.

60
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,930
Wha... really?

61
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:39,899
You should.
It's fun.

62
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:43,502
I love the people here.

63
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:48,240
And if there was one thing
I don't really care for,

64
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:51,944
is that they can be
terribly, terribly ignorant

65
00:02:51,946 --> 00:02:53,813
about other cultures.

66
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:56,282
And I don't want them
embarrassing me

67
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:58,717
in front of my girlfriend Carol.

68
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,454
Diwali is a very
important holiday

69
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:03,622
for the Hindus.

70
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,357
But, frankly,
I'm a little appalled

71
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,461
that none of you know very much
about Indian culture.

72
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,997
So with out further adieu,
Kelly!

73
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:15,100
You are on.

74
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:17,570
Um, Diwali is awesome.

75
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,871
And there's food,

76
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:20,706
and there's gonna be dancing.

77
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,842
And, oh,
I got the raddest outfit.

78
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,844
- It has sparkles...
- Kelly...

79
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:27,112
Um, why don't you tell us
a little bit about

80
00:03:27,114 --> 00:03:29,715
the origins of the holiday?

81
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:33,052
Oh, um, I don't know.
It's really old, I think.

82
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:35,087
How many gods do you have?

83
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,122
Like hundreds, I think.
Maybe more than that.

84
00:03:37,124 --> 00:03:39,358
And that blue, busty gal...
what's her story?

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,693
She looks like Pam

86
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:42,061
from the neck down.

87
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:43,262
Pam wishes.

88
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,799
Kelly, I'll take this one.

89
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:50,269
Diwali is a celebration
of the coronation god king Rama

90
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,538
after his epic battle
with Ravena,

91
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,806
the demon king of Lanka.

92
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,841
It symbolizes the battle
between good and evil.

93
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:57,610
All right, all right.
This isn't Lord of the Rings.

94
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,445
Hey, Polly.

95
00:04:01,848 --> 00:04:03,015
Oops, sorry.

96
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:04,617
Sorry.

97
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,419
I started biking to work.
Josh does it.

98
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,922
And he lives a lot
farther away than I do.

99
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:12,191
And also, it saves gas money.

100
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:15,294
It keeps me in shape.
Helps the environment.

101
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:20,366
And now I know it makes me
really sweaty for work.

102
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:23,235
Nice basket.

103
00:04:23,237 --> 00:04:25,204
Thank you.

104
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:29,141
Now, a lot of people say

105
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,644
that Kelly is one in a million.

106
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,978
And that's true,
but it's also not true.

107
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,847
Because, frankly,

108
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,715
there are literally
billions of people

109
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:38,584
just like Kelly in the world.

110
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:41,854
Here are some famous Indians.

111
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:47,927
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

112
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:51,463
He is a Nobel-Prize-winning
physicist.

113
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,831
Impressive.

114
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,433
Apu, from The Simpsons.

115
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,869
Hilarious Indian.

116
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:58,103
M. Night Shyamalan.

117
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,506
The Village, Unbreakable,
Sixth Sense.

118
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,374
I see dead people.

119
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,476
Okay!
Spoiler alert.

120
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,978
He was dead the whole time.

121
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,646
Just stop it!

122
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:09,214
What's...
Oh, wha...

123
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,850
Where did that come from?

124
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:17,289
Karen, my chips got stuck

125
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,624
in the vending machine again.

126
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:21,160
I need your...
skinny little arms.

127
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,594
Oh.

128
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:23,629
Did you shake it?

129
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:26,598
Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.

130
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:32,705
We have such
a roller coaster thing,

131
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,772
Karen and I.

132
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:35,607
Excuse me?

133
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,276
Roller-coastery friendship.

134
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,611
Hot and cold.
On again, off again.

135
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:42,982
Sexual-tension-filled
type of deal.

136
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:45,184
It's very Sam and Diane.

137
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:47,186
Wow.
From Cheers.

138
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:48,554
Yep.
Yeah.

139
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,689
And another thing about
the Indian people,

140
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:52,624
they love sex positions.

141
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:56,161
I present to you The Kama Sutra.

142
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,931
I mean, look at that.
Who has seen that before?

143
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,767
I have, that's
the union of the monkey.

144
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,303
Oh, that's what they call it.

145
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,305
This is the best meeting
we have ever had.

146
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:07,339
Thank you, Kevin.

147
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,074
I find this
incredibly offensive.

148
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,809
Well, I find it beautiful.

149
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:13,746
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do
in her own house is fine.

150
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,647
But we shouldn't
all be subjected to it.

151
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,583
Actually, she's right.

152
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,785
This isn't appropriate.

153
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:21,020
Why don't I take these?

154
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,421
You're not gonna collect them.

155
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,590
No, this is delightful,
charming culture.

156
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,159
My Indian cultural seminar
was going great

157
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:30,229
until Toby decided
that he was too immature

158
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:32,898
to deal with
culturally explicit images.

159
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,634
It's just sex, people.
Everybody does it.

160
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:38,237
I'm doing it with Carol.

161
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:41,273
Probably tonight.

162
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:43,876
All right.

163
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:45,477
I think you guys
should be all set.

164
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,212
Oh, here's the corporate card
for dinner.

165
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:48,847
Thanks.
Now, Karen...

166
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,716
Let's keep it
to $20 a person this time.

167
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:53,185
Got it.

168
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:55,621
Once a quarter,
the sales staff at this branch

169
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,791
has to stay late to do
order form consolidation.

170
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,260
Which... amazingly,

171
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,729
is even less interesting
than it sounds.

172
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:06,065
You guys ready to party?

173
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,599
What's that?

174
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,768
I said, are you ready

175
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,904
to part-ay!

176
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,815
Isn't this fun,
not wearing shoes?

177
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,716
I wish some of us still
had our shoes on.

178
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:27,052
Stop it.
It's a disease.

179
00:07:27,054 --> 00:07:28,821
I've... told you.

180
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:33,792
I thought you said
this was a costume party.

181
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,629
What does that look like to you?

182
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:39,731
An Indian woman in a sari.

183
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,400
No one's even gonna notice it.

184
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:42,534
Nice outfit.

185
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,069
Hey, Kevin, it's a costume.

186
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:46,271
You just cool it, okay?

187
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:47,840
Carol? Carol.

188
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,175
I'll have one of those as well.

189
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,344
Thank you very much.

190
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,246
Now, these are limes,
lemons, onions.

191
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,081
I'm a vegetarian.
What can I eat?

192
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,250
It's all vegetarian.

193
00:07:58,252 --> 00:07:59,885
I'll just have some bread.

194
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:04,590
You used your hands.

195
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,460
Oh, yuck.

196
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:09,461
Oh.

197
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,998
What, is it too spicy?

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,266
Yeah.

199
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,467
These s'mores are disgusting.

200
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:19,104
They're not s'mores.
They're samosas.

201
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,474
Do you think
they have any s'mores?

202
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:25,344
All they are is chocolate,
graham cracker, and marshmallow.

203
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:27,246
How difficult would
that have been?

204
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:33,152
So... you're Kelly's
sisters, huh?

205
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:40,726
What?
Rupa, Neefa, Tiffany,

206
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,127
stop acting like such
little losers,

207
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,128
and just be cool.

208
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,030
Come on, Ryan.
Come on.

209
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,866
Leave him alone.
I hate you guys.

210
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,635
They said something
about Zach Braff.

211
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:50,969
Don't even listen to them.

212
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:52,437
No, you know...

213
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,074
That's very official.

214
00:08:56,076 --> 00:08:57,176
I decided to come.

215
00:08:57,178 --> 00:09:00,379
Uh, I feel a little
underdressed.

216
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:02,314
But at least I'm not dressed

217
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:04,483
like a slutty cheerleader,
right?

218
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:06,218
Is that mean?

219
00:09:21,734 --> 00:09:23,302
Temp! Temp!

220
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:40,385
I don't even
wanna hear it, okay?

221
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,387
Stop it right now.

222
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:44,523
Ryan is a temporary worker,
makes no money.

223
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:46,558
Wali is a whole doctor,

224
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,794
so handsome, makes good money.

225
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,863
- You think I wanna date a doctor?
- He's a perfect match.

226
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,901
Hey, big tuna, you ready?

227
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:58,704
Yep.

228
00:09:58,706 --> 00:10:01,640
One, two, three.

229
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,908
Shot!

230
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:07,212
Ohh! Holy mother of God.

231
00:10:07,214 --> 00:10:09,114
Ooh, that burns.

232
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,983
Golly!

233
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,918
Good.

234
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,952
Whew.

235
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,908
Wow, 30 years!

236
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,544
And you two only met
once before the wedding night.

237
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:40,712
Yes.

238
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:42,147
Wow.

239
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,182
How long have you been
married to the cheerleader?

240
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:46,084
Oh...

241
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,286
She's not a cheerleader.

242
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:50,088
She thought this
was a costume party.

243
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,425
Um, no, we're not married.

244
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:55,394
Yet!

245
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:57,229
She's very fair.

246
00:10:57,231 --> 00:11:00,065
She is very fair.
Very fair and very kind.

247
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,800
So, um,

248
00:11:01,802 --> 00:11:04,636
tell me, is your marriage
the kind of thing

249
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:06,038
where when you die,

250
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
she has to throw herself
on fire?

251
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,708
No?

252
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,243
Okay.

253
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:13,178
It's still very cool.

254
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,813
Okay, thanks.

255
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:21,253
One, two, three.

256
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:22,587
Chug!

257
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:24,756
Ooh!

258
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,201
Are you okay?

259
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:38,770
I'm gonna be.

260
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,642
Hi.
I'm just gonna...

261
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,210
Just a sec, just a sec.

262
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,878
Um, everyone.

263
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,514
I'm sorry, could I have
your attention, please?

264
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:51,350
Thank you.

265
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,851
Ha ha! Hi!

266
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,354
Sorry, I just have
an announcement to make.

267
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:57,422
Um...

268
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:58,790
Okay.

269
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:02,928
I have learned a lot
about Indian culture tonight.

270
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,666
But I have learned
even more about love.

271
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,935
And I know you're all thinking,

272
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,472
"Who is this crazy gringo,
and what is he talkin' about?"

273
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:15,640
Well, I'm not crazy.

274
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:19,144
Maybe I'm crazy in love.

275
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:20,579
So, without

276
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:22,414
further adieu,

277
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,515
Carol...

278
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:26,752
Carol Stills...

279
00:12:26,754 --> 00:12:29,321
I would like you...

280
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:31,857
to do me the honor

281
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,960
of making me your husband.

282
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:39,197
Oh, Michael.

283
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:40,465
What do you say?

284
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:44,469
Can we talk
about this in private?

285
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:46,371
I didn't hear you.

286
00:12:46,373 --> 00:12:50,041
Can we talk about this
in private?

287
00:12:50,043 --> 00:12:52,110
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

288
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,846
Okay.

289
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:01,987
No, I get it.

290
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,588
I get it.
You're not ready.

291
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,623
We'll wait.

292
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,858
This is our ninth date, Michael.

293
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,527
Well, yeah, but I...

294
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,763
I feel like I've known you
many lifetimes.

295
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:14,366
Maybe I'm Hindu after all.

296
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:16,134
Okay, I'm not Hindu.

297
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:18,036
But... Carol...

298
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:19,805
Carol, I just feel like...

299
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:22,340
I just like you so much.

300
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,042
I'd better go.

301
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:25,877
Okay? You can find
a way home, all right?

302
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,912
Yes.

303
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:28,213
Okay.
Okay.

304
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,184
Okay.

305
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,485
Good night.

306
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:34,820
Hey, you know what?

307
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:36,488
Why don't I come with you?

308
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,825
'Cause I've got this book
called The Kama Sutra.

309
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:40,959
Okay, good night, Michael.

310
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,561
All right.

311
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:43,662
Good night.

312
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:51,837
Well, I was a temp,

313
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,972
but I got promoted.

314
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:57,809
So, um... the compensation
is a lot more competitive.

315
00:13:57,811 --> 00:14:00,278
So you're saving money now
to start a family and home?

316
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,515
Oh, um, or travel.

317
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:06,251
And, um, and buy an Xbox.

318
00:14:10,356 --> 00:14:12,824
Is there anything you wanted
to ask us tonight?

319
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:15,827
Can you believe my boss

320
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,062
proposed to his girlfriend
in public?

321
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,697
That is so Michael.

322
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,199
Is it?
He's really outgoing, huh?

323
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:23,602
Yeah.

324
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:25,570
Hey, would you excuse me
for a second?

325
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:27,272
Okay.

326
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:34,045
It's hot in there.

327
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,615
How's the naan?
Dry.

328
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:38,750
You looked like you
were having fun.

329
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,852
I am.
You should come dance with us.

330
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:43,555
I have to watch our shoes,
so they don't get stolen.

331
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:47,526
- Who are you texting?
- No one.

332
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:05,043
Andy, no a cappella.

333
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:19,791
Wait, wait.

334
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,037
It's not good.

335
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,073
Tuna! Are you kidding me?

336
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,445
Ohh!

337
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,447
Oh, my God.

338
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:45,517
Oh! Wow!

339
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,785
- Here.
- That's so spicy.

340
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:48,520
Yeah.

341
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:50,655
Ohh.

342
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:54,659
You waiting for a call?

343
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,394
Uh, no.

344
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,101
Wow.

345
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,340
Pam...

346
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,643
When Carol said no tonight,

347
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,244
I think I finally realized

348
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:15,113
how you must be feeling.

349
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:19,217
We are both the victims
of broken engagements.

350
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:22,287
Well, you were
never really engaged.

351
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:25,890
I was in that marriage arena,

352
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:28,326
though.

353
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:30,028
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

354
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,367
Ohh... well.

355
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:39,904
I kind of thought something
would happen tonight too.

356
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:43,642
We're so alike.

357
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:48,113
So alike.

358
00:16:58,157 --> 00:16:59,290
What are you doing?

359
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,660
What are you doing?

360
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:03,995
- I'm rejecting your kiss.
- What?

361
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:05,497
I didn't...

362
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,102
I wa...

363
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:24,683
Can I have a ride home?

364
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,318
If you sit in the back.

365
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:31,056
Okay, guys.

366
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:38,063
Hey, can I have a ride, man?

367
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:40,999
I, uh, I have my bike.

368
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,133
No way, dude.

369
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:44,369
I am not driving home.

370
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:47,539
I brought an inflatable bed

371
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,674
for just such occasions.

372
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,009
You're welcome to share it,
though.

373
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:52,677
It's a roomy twin.

374
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,280
Okay.

375
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:21,773
Hey, dummy, get in the car.

376
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,809
I'm a drunk driver.

377
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,944
Yes, you are.

378
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,012
Here, let me take that.

379
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:30,181
Just, uh, get in the car.

380
00:18:30,183 --> 00:18:32,317
You can really hold
your liquor, though, really.

381
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,351
Yeah, you can't.

382
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:36,421
Okay.

383
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,556
And I am just going to lie down
in the back,

384
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:39,958
if that's all right.

385
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,927
Sure.
Here's your... bag.

386
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,096
Just don't puke on anything.

387
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:51,469
You okay?

388
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:53,204
- So good.
- Good.

389
00:18:59,211 --> 00:19:01,279
These are not my shoes.

390
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:12,824
This is just like
that show Taxi Cab Confessions.

391
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:14,959
If you say one more word,
I'm stopping the car.

392
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,695
Sorry.

393
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:19,831
This is going out
to Indians everywhere.

394
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:22,801
It's a tribute
to one of the greats.

395
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:26,337
Mr. Adam Sandler.

396
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,078
Let me tell you something.

397
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,713
Tonight has been...

398
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:24,662
Happy Diwali!
