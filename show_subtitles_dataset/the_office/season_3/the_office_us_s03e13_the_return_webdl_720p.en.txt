1
00:00:00,731 --> 00:00:01,864
I have left Dunder-Mifflin

2
00:00:01,866 --> 00:00:04,366
after many
record-breaking years,

3
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:06,902
and I am officially
on the job market.

4
00:00:06,904 --> 00:00:08,137
And it's very exciting.

5
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:09,305
For your convenience,

6
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:11,240
I've broken it down
into three parts:

7
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:13,142
professional résumé,

8
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:15,511
athletic
and special skills résumé,

9
00:00:15,513 --> 00:00:17,680
and Dwight Schrute trivia.

10
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:19,815
I am ready
to face any challenges

11
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,751
that might be foolish enough
to face me.

12
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:23,185
How would I describe myself?

13
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:24,420
Three words:

14
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:25,554
Hardworking,

15
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:27,389
alpha male,

16
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:29,625
jackhammer.

17
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:30,693
Merciless.

18
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:32,394
Insatiable.

19
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:35,131
There's nothing on my horizon
except everything.

20
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,366
Everything is on my horizon.

21
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:39,135
I got this job
to make some money

22
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:41,570
while I continue
my employment search.

23
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:42,838
And, uh...

24
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,573
it's fine for the time being.

25
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:45,708
Oops.

26
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,309
Break's over.

27
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:57,019
Big Turkey.

28
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:10,966
Is that you singing?

29
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:11,967
All four parts.

30
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:13,369
Recorded it on my computer.

31
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:14,970
It took me forever.

32
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,981
You gonna answer it?

33
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,118
I called it myself.

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,619
I just thought you'd get a kick

35
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:31,620
out of the new ring.

36
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:32,288
Yikes.

37
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,455
Side note:

38
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:34,523
I'd just like
to say I'm thrilled

39
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:35,825
to be working
directly beneath you.

40
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:38,227
- Oh.
- I feel I have a lot to learn from you.

41
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,163
Even though you're younger
and have less experience.

42
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:43,399
So...

43
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,234
here's to the future.

44
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:47,203
Andy and The Tuna.

45
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:00,983
I miss Dwight.

46
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:05,321
Congratulations, Universe.

47
00:02:05,323 --> 00:02:07,289
You win.

48
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,227
Argh, top won't go up.

49
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:50,733
Oh, hey hey!
Look who's here.

50
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,835
- Hello, hello.
- Hi, Michael.

51
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:55,704
Welcome back.
- Good to see you.

52
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:59,375
As you know, Oscar is a gay man,

53
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:01,277
who is also my friend

54
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,545
and he has been on
a little bit of a sabbatical...

55
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:04,380
recently.

56
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,148
Seeing the world.
Finding himself.

57
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,983
Having lots of fun, no doubt.

58
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:09,218
What does that mean?

59
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,054
Oooh, check out the new car.

60
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:15,324
German engineering, nice. How
many pesos did that set you back?

61
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:16,825
It's a company lease.

62
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:17,993
From the settlement.

63
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:19,595
After you kissed me.

64
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:22,531
Well, that's how this company
takes care of our employees.

65
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,500
When we settle, we settle high.

66
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:27,303
I have an idea:

67
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:27,703
Rainbow stickers, all over
the back windshield.

68
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:30,239
Shout it from the mountain tops,
my friend.

69
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:31,907
Part of me wants the people
in this office

70
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,944
to have learned their lesson,
and just shut the hell up.

71
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:38,047
And part of me thinks...

72
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,214
"You know what?
Keep talking.

73
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:41,483
I'd really love
a home theater."

74
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,852
Yes, Dwight Schrute
has left the company...

75
00:03:43,854 --> 00:03:45,554
more personnel turnover.

76
00:03:45,556 --> 00:03:46,989
Cost of doin' business.

77
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,458
Yeah, well, it is a big loss.

78
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,694
Dwight was the top salesman.

79
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,162
Was the top salesman.

80
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:54,330
I said "was."

81
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,999
Addition by subtraction.

82
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,801
What does that even mean?

83
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,369
That is impossible.

84
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,503
Mmm...

85
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,339
Yeah, you're right.

86
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:05,574
But there is some good news.
Oscar is back.

87
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:08,110
Addition by addition.

88
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:10,846
So we are going
to have a big party today

89
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:13,415
to welcome him back,
and hopefully

90
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:15,351
that'll lift everyone's spirits.

91
00:04:15,353 --> 00:04:17,886
- Hey.
- Oscar!

92
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,321
- Pam.
- Good to have you back.

93
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:20,255
Good to be back.

94
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,926
- Welcome back, Oscar.
- Thank you.

95
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:25,594
- Good to be back.
- Hey, Oscar.

96
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:26,962
Hey, everyone.

97
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:28,664
Oh, hello, Oscar.

98
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,265
How was your gay-cation?

99
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,401
That's very funny.

100
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:34,403
I thought of that, like,

101
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:36,472
two seconds after you left.

102
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:42,911
Hi, Angela.

103
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,681
Oscar.

104
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:47,750
Hey, boss.

105
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:48,884
Hey, what's up?

106
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:50,419
Nooothin'.

107
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:54,256
Enhrrr... hehh.

108
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:58,193
Man, TGI Wednesday.

109
00:04:58,195 --> 00:04:59,595
Yeah.
- Am I right?

110
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:00,696
Yep.

111
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:02,931
Gonna go home, get my beer on,

112
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,601
get my Lost on.

113
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:07,503
What are you doin' later?
You want to hang out?

114
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,671
Uh... I don't know.

115
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:10,773
Maybe.

116
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:13,042
Well, I'll take that
as a "maybe."

117
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,017
Where you goin'?
- Bathroom.

118
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:23,285
Well, I'm going to the kitchen.

119
00:05:23,287 --> 00:05:24,620
I'll walk with you.

120
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,995
Yeah, things
are goin' pretty good.

121
00:05:32,997 --> 00:05:35,564
Gettin' a lot of face time
with the boss.

122
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:40,669
Oscar?

123
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:43,772
I have a question.

124
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:46,742
Would you like to join
the Party Planning Committee?

125
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:48,243
The committee
with all the women?

126
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:49,278
Yeah.

127
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,446
Because I'm gay?

128
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:52,081
- No.

129
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,682
No.

130
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:56,518
Certain events have transpired,

131
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,355
and I've thought
about certain things.

132
00:06:00,357 --> 00:06:01,690
And I'm sorry for the way

133
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:04,893
those certain events transpired.

134
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:07,129
And I would just like
to make some changes

135
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:09,731
about certain things

136
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:11,600
and certain situations.

137
00:06:11,602 --> 00:06:12,668
Okay, okay.
- And certain accountants.

138
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,669
All right, all right, I'll join.

139
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:14,670
I'd love to.

140
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:15,704
That's...

141
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:16,905
Thank you.

142
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:17,906
Thank you.

143
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:19,041
Thank you.

144
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,612
Can I join too?

145
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,015
Never.

146
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,384
You sell those two printers
this morning?

147
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:30,652
Nice work.

148
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:31,753
Child's play.

149
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:34,389
Give me something hard to sell.

150
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:40,395
Hey, where's Dwight?

151
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:41,530
You didn't hear?

152
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:44,199
Decapitated.
Whole, big thing.

153
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,268
We had a funeral for a bird.

154
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,972
I'm pretty sure
none of that's real.

155
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,541
You're not real, man.

156
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:55,310
Wow.

157
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:56,979
What is wrong with this thing?

158
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:58,347
It looks terrible.

159
00:06:58,349 --> 00:06:59,748
Do you want me to ask
the night cleaning crew

160
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,749
if they stopped watering it?

161
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:01,750
Yeah.

162
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:03,051
Oh, you know what?

163
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:05,053
Ask them about the toys
on my desk too.

164
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:07,589
They always used
to arrange the toys on my desk

165
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:10,025
in a... a very pleasing way.

166
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:11,393
It used to brighten my morning.

167
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,028
Oh, that wasn't the night crew.

168
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,129
That was Dwight.

169
00:07:15,698 --> 00:07:17,499
Really?

170
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,868
That was very nice of him.

171
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,038
We need more attitude like that
around this office.

172
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,740
Feel ya, dawg.

173
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:25,974
Yeah, do you?

174
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,643
Absolutely.

175
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:29,378
What did I say?

176
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,181
You said...

177
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:34,216
Ruh-duht duh duh-dooh.

178
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,284
Huh.

179
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:36,285
Which is, like,

180
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:37,452
"Right on."

181
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:39,021
Pam was like,
"Blah blah blah."

182
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:42,524
And you were like,
"Yeah. Psh-sht."

183
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,793
Nailed it.

184
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,099
Oh.

185
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,868
Oh, no.

186
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,903
Love that Andy, right?

187
00:07:54,905 --> 00:07:56,505
Solid fellow?

188
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:57,573
Seems smart enough.

189
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,641
Likes me a lot.

190
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:00,976
A lot.

191
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:02,811
Too much.

192
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:05,881
Like a crazy person, a little.

193
00:08:05,883 --> 00:08:09,484
Not super crazy, just...

194
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,887
there's something about him
that creeps me out.

195
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,122
I can't really explain it.

196
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:16,358
He's always up in my bidness,

197
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,895
which is Ebonics
for "being in my face

198
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:22,264
and annoying
the bejesus out of me."

199
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:25,100
I don't understand how someone

200
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:27,836
could have
so little self-awareness.

201
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,744
I really have no preference.

202
00:08:35,746 --> 00:08:37,279
We don't even have
to have a party.

203
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,014
No. Hey, hey...

204
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:40,082
Don't be ridiculous.

205
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,451
Of course we are going
to have a party,

206
00:08:42,453 --> 00:08:44,386
a celebration of Oscar.

207
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:45,587
Oscar night.

208
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,689
And I want it
to be Oscar-specific.

209
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:48,790
Michael, I...
- No, no.

210
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,692
I mean, not...
not because you're gay.

211
00:08:50,694 --> 00:08:51,927
Your gayness

212
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,428
does not define you.
- Okay.

213
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,798
Your Mexican-ness
is what defines you to me.

214
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,402
And I think we should celebrate
Oscar's Mexicanity.

215
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,137
So... Phyllis,

216
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:05,941
I want you
to go find firecrackers...

217
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:07,376
and a Chihuahua.

218
00:09:07,378 --> 00:09:10,646
Pam, in the frozen food section,

219
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,547
Swanson makes
a delightful chimichanga.

220
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:14,383
Why don't you have me
riding in on a donkey

221
00:09:14,385 --> 00:09:16,551
into the office, like Pepe?

222
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:18,053
Ah... a burro.
Of course.

223
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:21,056
If Oscar wants a donkey,
let's get him one.

224
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,993
Need any help?

225
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:27,496
Oh, no thank you.

226
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:29,464
I'm... I'm just looking.

227
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:30,565
Great.

228
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,938
I will literally
be standing right here

229
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,241
if you need anything at all.

230
00:09:41,644 --> 00:09:43,779
Okay.

231
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:49,217
I think I could go for some
tuna fish right about now.

232
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:52,054
Oh, oh, oh, got my rod here.

233
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:54,289
Whizzzzzz...

234
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,390
Bloop.

235
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,226
Click, click.

236
00:09:58,228 --> 00:09:59,928
Click, click, click.

237
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,330
Click, click.

238
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:02,564
Click, click, click, click.

239
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,799
Click, click, click, click.

240
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:04,833
Click, click,
click... Argh!

241
00:10:04,835 --> 00:10:06,134
Oop! Oh.

242
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:07,836
I got one.
I got one.

243
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:08,937
Eeh!

244
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:12,307
Hey.

245
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:14,076
Hey.
- Hey.

246
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,080
So, Andy is in rare form today.

247
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:20,882
Yeah, you should
not encourage him.

248
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:22,317
Encourage him?

249
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,386
I'm the victim, okay?

250
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:25,754
He's fishing for me.

251
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:27,022
We've got to do something.

252
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:29,891
Look, I've got,
like, 15 new clients

253
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:31,059
that I've inherited from Dwight,

254
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:32,761
and each file
is password protected

255
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:34,129
with a different
mythical creature,

256
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,565
so... I'm sorry.

257
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,800
I can't.

258
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:40,569
Fine.

259
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,137
Party pooper.

260
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,175
Oop! Ooh.
Rah!

261
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:48,410
Unh!

262
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:49,444
Ooh!

263
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,246
Ah! Whoa!

264
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:53,382
Who's that sportscaster
that bit that lady?

265
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:54,850
Marv something?

266
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:55,851
Floppin' around!

267
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:57,018
Andy is like Marv something.

268
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,054
Great sportscaster...

269
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,356
big, weirdo creep.

270
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:03,959
185 pounder.
Check it out.

271
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,528
Whew!
Ahh!

272
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:14,403
Hey, Ryan?
- What?

273
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,204
Do you wanna pull a prank
on Andy?

274
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:20,809
Not right now,
but ask me again 10 years ago.

275
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:24,880
I liked you better as the temp.

276
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:26,615
Me too.

277
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:30,118
Hey, guys.

278
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,553
How's the workload

279
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:34,389
on all of Dwight's old accounts?

280
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:35,323
Handling it okay?

281
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:37,826
Sort of.
He had a lot of clients.

282
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:39,694
Yes, he did.

283
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,363
Have any of you

284
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:42,731
talked to Dwight?

285
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:43,799
Oh, sure.

286
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,300
We talk all the time.

287
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,035
Really?
- No.

288
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:48,236
Don't... don't do that.

289
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:49,638
That's not nice.

290
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,339
What about you, Phyllis?

291
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:52,908
You and Dwight were close.

292
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,243
No. Sorry.

293
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:56,578
Dwight had a big personality,

294
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,680
and I have a big personality.

295
00:11:58,682 --> 00:11:59,948
And a lot of times

296
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,783
when two people like that
get together,

297
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:03,819
it can be explosive.

298
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:06,488
Really comin' down out there.

299
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,557
Commute's gonna be hell.

300
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,892
I have snow tires and chains.

301
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:14,062
Plus exceptional
eye-hand coordination.

302
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:19,000
So, um, where were you
workin' before this?

303
00:12:19,002 --> 00:12:20,702
Dunder-Mifflin.

304
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:22,704
What kind of company is that?

305
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,841
Paper company.

306
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:28,643
They're only one of Staples'
top competitors in the area.

307
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:32,514
I never heard of 'em.
- Whoa.

308
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:34,816
Really?
Have you heard of paper?

309
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:37,986
It's gonna be like that, huh?

310
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:40,856
I don't like him,
his giant head,

311
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:42,824
or his beady little eyes.

312
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,926
That's all I got to say
on the matter.

313
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:09,818
Would you like
to pull a prank on Andy?

314
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,887
I'm kind of in the middle
of... Yes, please.

315
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:13,054
Okay, good.

316
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:14,356
Stay right here.

317
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:21,863
- Oh.
- Sorry about that.

318
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:23,331
Good move, Tuna.

319
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,799
Nice one.

320
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:29,471
Are there any messages?

321
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:30,572
Nope.

322
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:31,573
So weird.

323
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,841
Hmm.

324
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:45,053
Nice to have Oscar back.

325
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:46,154
Yeah.

326
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:27,395
So how much do you
love Lance Bass now?

327
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,197
I don't know who that is.

328
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,899
You don't know
who Lance Bass is?

329
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:33,101
He's only one of the five
best singers ever,

330
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:35,170
and, gay.

331
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,938
I've never heard of him.

332
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,408
Oscar, you really need to learn
more about your culture.

333
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,559
I'm not fine.

334
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:00,996
And no, I don't want
to talk about it.

335
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:03,598
All right.
- Okay, fine.

336
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,434
What do you think of Andy?

337
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:08,136
Uhm...

338
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:11,806
Because on paper, Andy and I
should be best buds.

339
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,743
We even have the same Top Ten
All-Time Favorite Movie list,

340
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:17,445
down to the number.

341
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:19,914
Andy's a "Yes-man."

342
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,082
Not all the time.

343
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:23,785
Sometimes I'll say
I don't like something,

344
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:25,854
he says he
doesn't like it, either.

345
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:28,923
Right.

346
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:31,326
He'll always agree
with whatever you say.

347
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,895
He did the same thing with Josh
in Stamford.

348
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:39,267
If he did that with Josh,
he could be doing that with me.

349
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:44,239
When I was five years old,
I had these Spiderman pajamas.

350
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:47,075
And one night,
my mom was tucking me in,

351
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:52,414
and she tried to give me
a raspberry on my tummy.

352
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,249
You know...
pff-f-ft...

353
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:57,152
and, uh,
I tried to crawl away,

354
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:59,020
and what happened was,

355
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:02,824
her eyes were closed,
and she grabbed me...

356
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:05,560
and she kissed me

357
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:08,129
on my butt.

358
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:11,132
And it was just the worst.

359
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:17,338
So I know what it's like
to have your butt kissed.

360
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,108
literally.

361
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,378
And it-it-it's terrible.

362
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,448
And it better not be
what Andy is doing.

363
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,063
Um... Large Tuna.

364
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:44,966
Have you seen
my cell phone device?

365
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:49,204
'Cause someone
is calling right now.

366
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,271
There is a call.

367
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:11,960
Angela?

368
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,998
Is everything okay?

369
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,868
No.

370
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,036
I miss him.

371
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:23,338
Dwight?

372
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,040
No.
John Denver.

373
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:28,209
Okay.
That's a good talk.

374
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:31,379
Wait, I'm sorry.

375
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,948
He's gone because of me.

376
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,918
I told him I would be upset
if people knew about us,

377
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,954
so he didn't have an alibi
for Michael.

378
00:17:39,956 --> 00:17:42,390
I denied him.

379
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:45,527
I still think there's a way
you can explain it to Michael.

380
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:46,928
somehow.

381
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,064
Pam, I am not like you.

382
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,433
Walking around in your
provocative outfits,

383
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:56,471
saying whatever thought
pops in your head

384
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:59,040
Yeah... that's me.

385
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:04,479
Thank you.
This was helpful.

386
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,326
What are you talkin' about?

387
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:20,762
Where is my freaking phone?

388
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,966
You know what?
Maybe it's in the ceiling.

389
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:27,802
You know what?
Maybe you're in the ceiling.

390
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,774
I don't trust you, Phyllis.

391
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:39,814
Michael?

392
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:40,915
Yes?

393
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,151
Never mind, you're busy.
I'll come back tomorrow.

394
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,119
No, what is it?

395
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,187
I...

396
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,793
I just...

397
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,494
that Dwight
was late that morning

398
00:18:53,496 --> 00:18:54,929
because he had
to drive to New York

399
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:58,032
to drop off the correlated tax
forms that I forgot to send.

400
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,638
Though to be fair,
Kevin never reminded me.

401
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,609
Why would Dwight
do that for you?

402
00:19:07,611 --> 00:19:10,778
I think I know why.

403
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,484
Because Dwight would do that
for anyone here.

404
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:21,055
Because Dwight
loves this company, that's why.

405
00:19:21,057 --> 00:19:23,791
Do you think that anyone else
out there

406
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:25,560
would have driven
to corporate for you?

407
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:27,362
None of them...

408
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:30,198
especially not Andy.

409
00:19:47,683 --> 00:19:50,018
Pam, I have a mission
to accomplish.

410
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,719
Make sure this party
gets rolling,

411
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:52,954
and I will be back shortly.

412
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:54,088
Hey-oh.

413
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,189
Where are you going?
Do you want me to come with?

414
00:19:55,191 --> 00:19:56,424
Um...

415
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:57,558
Just listen.

416
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,328
I forgot to tell you the plan
for this Saturday:

417
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,064
you, me, bar, beers, buzzed...

418
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,933
wings, shots, drunk.

419
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:07,001
Waitresses hot.

420
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:10,438
Football... Cornell/Hofstra:
slaughter.

421
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,874
Then quick nap at my place,
and we hit the tiz-own.

422
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:13,942
No.

423
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:16,110
I don't want to do any of that.

424
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,412
Duh.

425
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:19,280
Which is why
I was joking about doing it.

426
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:20,848
No, just stop. Stop.

427
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,351
You're going to drive me crazy.

428
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,855
Fine, I'll just go sit
at my desk and be quiet.

429
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:30,425
Sorry I annoyed you
with my friendship.

430
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:39,934
And I'm also sorry

431
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:41,936
that a lot of people here

432
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,972
for some reason think it's funny

433
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,074
to steal
someone's personal property

434
00:20:46,076 --> 00:20:47,141
and hide it from him.

435
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:50,345
Here's a little news flash.

436
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:51,813
It's not funny!

437
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,483
In fact,
it's pretty freakin' unfunny!

438
00:20:58,388 --> 00:21:00,388
Oh, my God!

439
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,789
Ow!

440
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:11,599
That was an overreaction.

441
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:15,737
Gonna hit the break room.
Does anybody want anything?

442
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:16,637
Pam, you good?

443
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:17,972
Yeah.

444
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,040
Sure? Okay.

445
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:25,246
I made a mess.

446
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:27,582
I forced Dwight
to resign prematurely,

447
00:21:27,584 --> 00:21:29,984
and I replace him with Andy,

448
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:34,055
who loves this place so much,
he punched a hole in it.

449
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:36,357
It's a mess.
A big mess.

450
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,626
And it's weird,
because this is not like me.

451
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:43,331
I am usually the guy they call
in to clean up the mess.

452
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:50,238
Well, I guess today, I am going
to have to call in myself.

453
00:21:57,213 --> 00:21:58,546
Eh.

454
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:08,322
Dwight.

455
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:10,191
Dwight!

456
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:11,893
I'm sorry.

457
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,631
No, that question
is meaningless.

458
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:18,199
Just go with the copy paper.

459
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:19,634
It's your funeral.

460
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:21,269
See how that works out for you.

461
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,373
Hey.

462
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:28,276
Hey.

463
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:29,510
What's up?

464
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:33,114
Same old.

465
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:37,685
Um...

466
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:45,493
It takes a big man
to admit his mistake.

467
00:22:45,495 --> 00:22:48,029
And I am that big man.

468
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:51,332
Angela from accounting
told me what you did.

469
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:52,767
Oh, my God, she told you?

470
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,035
Yes, she did.

471
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:55,970
And, Dwight...

472
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:59,507
if you were willing
to do something like that

473
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:01,709
for some random co-worker,

474
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:07,982
then clearly I misjudged you
from the beginning...

475
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:10,451
and I apologize.

476
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:15,456
Accepted.

477
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:21,762
How's this place treating you?

478
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:24,165
The boss isn't funny.

479
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,199
Ooh, well.

480
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:26,367
I don't get to wear my ties.

481
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:27,368
No.

482
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,402
I'm sure.

483
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:29,437
So?

484
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,139
So maybe you should come back.

485
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:34,542
You should come back.

486
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:36,310
Please.

487
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,647
I don't want
to do your laundry anymore.

488
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:43,317
We can talk about that.

489
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,858
All right.

490
00:24:02,205 --> 00:24:03,571
Oh, my God.

491
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:05,540
That's half-inch drywall.

492
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,441
I think we broke his brain.

493
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:12,013
It's not freakin' funny.

494
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:16,250
Are you enjoying your fiesta?

495
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:17,585
Actually, yeah.

496
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:19,754
I didn't think
I would, but turns

497
00:24:19,756 --> 00:24:21,222
out it's great.

498
00:24:21,224 --> 00:24:22,723
Ladies and gentlemen!

499
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,225
May I present...

500
00:24:24,227 --> 00:24:25,459
Mr. Dwight Schrute!

501
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:26,761
- Yay.
- Yay.

502
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:32,767
Welcome back.

503
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:34,802
Thank you.

504
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:40,141
Okay, Dwight,
you can let go of her hand.

505
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:41,642
You're gonna break it.

506
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:44,912
Not bad, huh?

507
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:46,514
You did this for me?

508
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:50,651
Guilty.

509
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,628
Where'd you get this stuff?

510
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,896
Gerdy's.

511
00:25:01,898 --> 00:25:03,331
Which aisle?

512
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,632
I don't remember.

513
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:07,034
Well, draw me a map, mama.

514
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:10,137
Pam.

515
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:12,139
I will shake mine,
and then you will-

516
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:14,208
No, I will not.

517
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:21,816
My God...

518
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:26,287
So does this remind you
of your childhood, or anything?

519
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:30,992
It reminds me a lot
of The Three Amigos,

520
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:33,594
with Steve Martin
and Chevy Chase.

521
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:35,563
Wow.
Thank you.

522
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:39,100
Wow, that's...
Thanks so much.

523
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:47,808
Hey.

524
00:25:54,183 --> 00:25:57,084
Do you still have feelings
for her?

525
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:04,592
Yes.

526
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:24,545
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the big finale.

527
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:26,847
Sir, would you do the honor?

528
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:29,350
Oh, man.

529
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:32,853
No, no, no.

530
00:26:32,855 --> 00:26:34,522
I don't need it.

531
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:37,325
Get out!

532
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:43,164
It takes a big man
to admit his mistake,

533
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,566
and that's what I did.

534
00:26:45,568 --> 00:26:47,902
The important thing is...

535
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:50,171
I learned something.

536
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:53,507
I don't want somebody
sucking up to me

537
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,344
because they think
I am going to help their career.

538
00:26:56,346 --> 00:27:00,348
I want them sucking up to me

539
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,819
because they genuinely love me.

540
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:06,387
Hmm.

541
00:27:08,423 --> 00:27:09,757
So Michael had
a little chat with corporate,

542
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,894
and they decided to send me
to management training.

543
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:17,164
Anger management, technically,
but still...

544
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,567
management material.

545
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:21,836
This whole thing is supposed to
take ten weeks,

546
00:27:21,838 --> 00:27:23,170
I expect to be done in five.

547
00:27:23,172 --> 00:27:25,773
Name repetition,
personality mirroring,

548
00:27:25,775 --> 00:27:30,144
and positive reinforcement
through nods and smiles.

549
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:32,213
So, don't worry about
old Andy Bernard,

550
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:33,781
I'll be back.

551
00:27:33,783 --> 00:27:34,849
just like Rambo.

552
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:36,717
- Oh, hi, you must be Andy.
- Oh, hi.

553
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:39,754
Yes, I am,
