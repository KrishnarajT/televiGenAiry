1
00:00:01,692 --> 00:00:03,225
Good morning, Pam.

2
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:05,161
Oh, welcome back, Andy.

3
00:00:05,163 --> 00:00:07,630
Drew.
I'm Drew now.

4
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,165
Oh... Drew.

5
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:10,499
Sorry.

6
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:13,836
Apology not accepted.

7
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:15,805
Because it wasn't even necessary

8
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,573
in the first place.

9
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:19,375
Several weeks ago,

10
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:22,044
Andy Bernard had an incident.

11
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:23,079
Gaaah!

12
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:24,413
Ohh!

13
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:27,483
But after five weeks
in anger management,

14
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:28,484
I'm back.

15
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,352
And I've got a new attitude.

16
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:32,254
And a new name.

17
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,024
And... a bunch
of new techniques

18
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:36,726
for dealing with the grumpies.

19
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:38,427
Morning, Jim.

20
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,162
Hey, Andy.
How are you, man?

21
00:00:40,164 --> 00:00:42,231
Good. Drew.

22
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:43,299
What's that?

23
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:44,867
You can call me Drew.

24
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:46,602
No, I'm not gonna call you that.

25
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:48,738
Cool.

26
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,072
I can't control what you do.

27
00:00:50,074 --> 00:00:52,508
I can only control what I do.

28
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,542
Andy.

29
00:00:53,544 --> 00:00:55,411
Drew.

30
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,913
Dwight.

31
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:01,383
How's it going, man?

32
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:05,187
Yes, I have decided
to shun Andy Bernard

33
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,589
for the next three years.

34
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,624
Which I'm looking forward to.

35
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:10,593
It's an Amish technique.

36
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:12,628
It's like slapping someone
with silence.

37
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,196
I was shunned
from the age of four

38
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:15,498
until my sixth birthday

39
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,534
for not saving the excess oil
from a can of tuna.

40
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,637
Jim, could you please
inform Andy Bernard

41
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:24,173
that he is being shunned.

42
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:25,941
Andy, Dwight says welcome back,

43
00:01:25,943 --> 00:01:27,543
and he could use a hug.

44
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,678
Okay, tell him
that that's not true.

45
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
Dwight says that he actually
doesn't know

46
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:32,948
one single fact
about bear attacks.

47
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,216
- Okay, no, Jim...
- You guys.

48
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,486
Tell him bears can climb
faster than they can run.

49
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:38,554
Jim!

50
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,489
Tell him!

51
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:42,291
Andy...
Nah, that's too far.

52
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:44,360
Damn you.

53
00:02:05,148 --> 00:02:08,951
Today is safety training day.

54
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:11,153
Toby is leading ours upstairs.

55
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:12,154
Yuck.

56
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:14,423
But I am giving everyone

57
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,125
a little bit of a treat.

58
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,194
We are going to listen in
on Darryl's presentation

59
00:02:18,196 --> 00:02:19,361
to the warehouse.

60
00:02:19,363 --> 00:02:22,965
And if I know Darryl,
it gonna be zoppity.

61
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:24,633
Now...

62
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:27,169
this is the forklift.

63
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,571
You need... you need

64
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:31,407
a license to operate
this machine.

65
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,143
That means the upstairs
office workers can't drive it.

66
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:35,544
Quiz. Mike.

67
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:36,679
Hmm?

68
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:37,713
Should you drive the forklift?

69
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:38,814
I can, and I have.

70
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:39,815
No, no, no, no, no, no!

71
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:40,850
I said should you?

72
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,418
You should not drive it.

73
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,119
You should not
drive the forklift.

74
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,621
- You understand?
- You're now allowed to drive the forklift.

75
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,256
It's not safe.
You don't have a license.

76
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:49,725
Guys, I'm not the only one
who's driven the forklift.

77
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,393
Pudge has driven the forklift.

78
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:52,895
Madge.

79
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:54,296
I thought your name was Pudge.

80
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,131
No, it's always been Madge.

81
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,900
Okay.

82
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:58,968
Um, her.

83
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,437
Her, yes, "her" is qualified

84
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,638
to work a dangerous machine.

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,672
You are not.

86
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:05,341
Okay?

87
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:06,475
Ah... fine.

88
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,509
Do you understand that?

89
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,844
Yesh.

90
00:03:08,846 --> 00:03:10,479
We do safety training
every year.

91
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,514
Or after an accident.

92
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:15,217
We've never made it a full year.

93
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,886
This particular time,

94
00:03:16,888 --> 00:03:19,722
I was reaching for a supply box
on the top shelf,

95
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:24,393
when one office worker
who shall remain nameless

96
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:27,162
kicked the ladder out
from under me and yelled...

97
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,931
"Hey, Darryl,
how's it hangin'?"

98
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,335
And I fell
and busted my ankle and...

99
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:36,071
I'm legitimately scared
for my workers.

100
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:40,042
The bailer can flatten
a car engine.

101
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:43,379
It can cut off your arm
and crush your entire body

102
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,480
without skipping a beat.

103
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:45,748
Yeah!

104
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,882
It's on.

105
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:49,151
How many people a year
do you think

106
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:50,986
get their arms cut off
in a bailer?

107
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:52,888
Bail 'er?
I hardly know her.

108
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,290
Damn it, Michael,
pay attention, man.

109
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,925
Anybody wanna take a guess?

110
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:57,927
Five bucks says it's over 50.

111
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:58,928
You really wanna bet?

112
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,995
Anybody?

113
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:01,130
Ever since March Madness ended,

114
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:02,631
I am so bored.

115
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:03,732
- How many?
- Okay, you're on.

116
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:05,734
Ten people, Michael.

117
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,236
Ten people.

118
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:08,537
Would you like
to be one of them?

119
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,638
No, don't worry about it.

120
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,806
We'll just go double or nothing.

121
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,141
On what?

122
00:04:12,143 --> 00:04:13,142
I don't know.
We'll figure something out.

123
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:14,643
What are you guys talking about?

124
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:17,246
These are very dangerous
machines down here.

125
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:21,016
And the upstairs workers,
Michael...

126
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,818
should not go
anywhere near them.

127
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,186
Yes, yes.

128
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:25,888
But it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world...

129
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,423
It would be the worst thing
in the world, it would!

130
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:29,224
What the hell
is wrong with this man?

131
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:30,993
It's a big, red trash compactor.

132
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,928
It's not a trash compactor!

133
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,063
It's a bailer.

134
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,165
Okay, I got it!
I got it!

135
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,033
Only on the rarest
of occasions...

136
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,601
No, do not touch it!

137
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,004
There is no occasion for you
to go near this stuff, okay?

138
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:45,240
Toby now has the floor.

139
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,710
And he is going to try
not to screw this up.

140
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,845
Like everything else
in his life.

141
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,281
Let me rephrase that.

142
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,516
I believe that you can do
safety training

143
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:56,785
and make it sound
just as good as Darryl.

144
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,155
Here we go!

145
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:02,691
Okay, um... one thing
you're gonna wanna look out for

146
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:03,993
is carpal tunnel syndrome.

147
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:05,494
It's recommended that you take

148
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:07,596
a ten-minute break
from typing every hour.

149
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,832
For your circulation, um,

150
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,367
you're gonna wanna get up
out of your chairs,

151
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:14,169
and, uh, and move around
about ten minutes every hour.

152
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:15,871
Yes, good, fine.

153
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,473
Like stretching and...

154
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,674
Um... yeah.

155
00:05:18,676 --> 00:05:20,009
Your computer screen

156
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,044
can be a big strain
on your eyes.

157
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:24,747
So it's also recommended
that you step away

158
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:26,882
for about... about
ten minutes every hour.

159
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:29,284
Wow, that is...
that time really adds up.

160
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,687
That's like a half an hour
every hour.

161
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,023
Take them at the same time.

162
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:35,124
Okay, you know what?

163
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,558
You're making it
sound kind of lame.

164
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,162
So skip ahead to the really
dangerous stuff.

165
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,865
Like sometimes,
computers can explode.

166
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:43,899
Can they not?

167
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:45,134
No, no.

168
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:49,204
Um, you always want
to keep a sweater or cardigan

169
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:51,540
of some sort
in case it gets drafty.

170
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:52,808
What about
a long-sleeved tee?

171
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,809
Well, that'll work.

172
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,411
Long johns? A shawl?

173
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:56,845
You know, anything
that warms you.

174
00:05:56,847 --> 00:05:58,080
Okay, you know what?

175
00:05:58,082 --> 00:05:59,915
I think that everybody
is going to vomit

176
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,250
due to boredom.

177
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:04,219
Sorry, he is very lame.

178
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,922
Um... let's see.

179
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:08,824
Seasonal affective disorder.

180
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,060
"A depression
that includes weight gain,

181
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,561
"fatigue, irritability,

182
00:06:12,563 --> 00:06:14,963
brought on by the low light
of winter."

183
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:17,066
Thank God we only had
the bailer to deal with.

184
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:19,134
Yeah, that dim light
is a bitch, ain't it?

185
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:20,235
Okay, guys, you know what?

186
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:21,303
I didn't interrupt

187
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:23,138
when you were having
your presentation.

188
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,440
Actually, you did.

189
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:26,809
Yes.

190
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,610
Okay, let's do another one.

191
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:29,812
This is a good one.

192
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:32,648
"A particular concern
for office workers

193
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,783
"is a sedimentary lifestyle,

194
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:35,984
which can contribute..."

195
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:37,653
Sedentary.

196
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:41,990
Yes, "which can contribute
to heart disease."

197
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:45,127
Heart disease kills
more people than bailers.

198
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,962
That's called having
a fat butt, Michael.

199
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,664
Mmm, no, no, it's...

200
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,999
Yeah, yeah.
That's fat butt disease.

201
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:52,134
That's what you're
suffering from?

202
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:53,502
No. Fat butt disease, Michael?

203
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:54,770
No, I...

204
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:56,438
Excuse me, Sea Monster,
you weigh, like, 1,000 pounds.

205
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,706
Yeah, I bet you'd like to swim

206
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,174
with this sea monster,
wouldn't you?

207
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,709
Ryan!

208
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,277
Dude, please,
tell your girl to shut up.

209
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,346
What? Kelly, you
insulted the gentleman.

210
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:05,380
Please, apologize.

211
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:06,381
Are you kidding me?

212
00:07:06,383 --> 00:07:07,583
All right, we out of here.

213
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:09,751
Darryl, I did not walk out
in the middle of yours.

214
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:10,786
So I...

215
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:12,254
Yeah, but ours
was real, Michael.

216
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:14,022
- Yes.
- That's what we been trying to tell you, Mike.

217
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:15,757
It's serious down there.

218
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,959
We do dangerous stuff, man.

219
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:19,361
This is shenanigans,
foolishness.

220
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:21,096
NERF ball.

221
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:24,533
You live a sweet little
NERF-y life.

222
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:26,401
Sittin' on your biscuit.

223
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,303
Never havin' to risk it.

224
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:32,341
Okay...

225
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:38,113
What, NERF isn't cool anymore?

226
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:39,948
Darryl thinks he's such a man

227
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,817
because he works in a warehouse.

228
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,385
Well, big deal.

229
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:46,555
I worked in a warehouse...
Men's Wearhouse.

230
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,690
I was a greeter.

231
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,058
I'd like to see Darryl
greet people.

232
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,294
Probably make 'em
feel like wimps.

233
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:54,062
Not me.
I...

234
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:59,568
Hello, I'm Michael.
Welcome to Men's Wearhouse.

235
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,737
We have a special
on khaki pants today.

236
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:06,542
This is one example.

237
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,577
Ten.

238
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,879
Really, ten?
That's your guess?

239
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:12,381
You're a professional
accountant.

240
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:14,049
There's, like, ten green ones.

241
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,083
42.

242
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:16,118
I'm gonna say 50.

243
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,386
51.

244
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:18,820
- Oh, don't be that person.
- Come on, that is lame.

245
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:19,821
It's a strategy.

246
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:20,822
It's called being smart.

247
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:21,857
- Thank you.
- Oh, jeez.

248
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:26,261
I don't know how the whole
betting thing started,

249
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:27,763
but it's fun.

250
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,830
- Ten.
- Kev's out.

251
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:29,831
Damn it!

252
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,500
47, 48, 49!

253
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:32,501
Jim wins!

254
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:33,535
Oh!

255
00:08:33,537 --> 00:08:34,603
That is not fair.

256
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:35,804
He has spent hours up here

257
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,206
at reception with you.

258
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,741
Hours and hours.

259
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:41,076
Okay... okay.

260
00:08:41,078 --> 00:08:42,744
No, constantly...
like, for years.

261
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:44,012
Okay.

262
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:46,248
Pam, depression is as scary
as a bailer, right?

263
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,617
I... don't understand
the question.

264
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:51,153
"Working in a office
can lead to depression

265
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,921
"which can lead
to suicide."

266
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:56,925
I mean this
is really serious stuff.

267
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:57,926
Yeah.

268
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:58,927
I... I...

269
00:08:58,929 --> 00:08:59,995
Nobody commits suicide

270
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,797
because they work with a bailer.

271
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,832
And yet those guys
are making fun of me.

272
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,101
Calling me a NERF.
That...

273
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:08,570
It's really hard
to demonstrate depression.

274
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:11,006
Their safety training
had visuals.

275
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:14,276
Yeah... you are...

276
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:16,612
Ah, so right.

277
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:18,013
They have visual aids.

278
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,849
And all we had were the facts.

279
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,351
You don't go
to the science museum

280
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:26,021
and get handed a pamphlet
on electricity.

281
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,522
You go to the science museum

282
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:30,192
and you put your hand
on a metal ball.

283
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,994
Your hair sticks up straight.

284
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:33,795
And you know science.

285
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,297
So you're okay?

286
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:37,232
Indubitably.

287
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:40,168
They use props.

288
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,670
They use visual aids.

289
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:44,773
And they just made us
look like dopes.

290
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:46,174
Idiots!

291
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:48,076
God, what are we gonna do!

292
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:49,244
I don't know.
I don't know.

293
00:09:49,246 --> 00:09:51,413
Because you know what
our killer is?

294
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:54,049
Depression.
Wolves.

295
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,083
Depression.

296
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:56,151
Visual aids.

297
00:09:56,153 --> 00:09:57,819
Yes.

298
00:09:57,821 --> 00:09:59,688
A quilt...
depression quilt?

299
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:03,725
No time to sew a quilt.

300
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,395
I got it.

301
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,396
Give me the number

302
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,964
for the Giant Big Box toy store.

303
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:15,137
You may be asking yourself,

304
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,239
"What am I doing
on a trampoline?"

305
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,008
Well, I thought I'd bounce here
for a while,

306
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,911
relieve some stress,
and then move on with my day.

307
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,246
Not!

308
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,447
Here's the plan.

309
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:27,549
Dwight is going to gather

310
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:30,419
all of the office workers
and all of the warehouse guys

311
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,721
and we're going to have
another safety seminar.

312
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:34,623
Only this time, where's Michael?

313
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,624
Oh, my God!

314
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,225
He is on the roof!

315
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:38,960
Now I've got their attention.

316
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:40,696
I tell them about

317
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:43,498
the cold hard facts
of depression.

318
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,533
And then I say,

319
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:47,903
"Hey, you ever seen
a suicide?"

320
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:49,638
And I jump.

321
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,039
And they freak out.

322
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,842
And they get to see
the dangers of depression

323
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:55,477
with their own eyes.

324
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,746
Nice side note...
they might think,

325
00:10:57,748 --> 00:10:59,648
hey, I should've been nicer
to Michael.

326
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,084
But that's not why
I'm doing this.

327
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:03,251
Then I land on the trampoline,

328
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:05,153
take a couple extra bounces
for fun.

329
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:06,788
I climb off,
walk around the corner.

330
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,357
Ta-freakin'-da!

331
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,393
So then the next movie
moves to the top of the queue.

332
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:12,661
So number five becomes
number four.

333
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:13,995
Number six becomes number five.

334
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:15,263
Number three becomes number two.

335
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:16,498
Etcetera, etcetera.

336
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,599
And let's just say

337
00:11:17,601 --> 00:11:19,101
that I just sent back
Love Actually,

338
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:20,102
which was awesome.

339
00:11:20,104 --> 00:11:21,269
And they sent me Uptown Girls,

340
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:22,637
which is also awesome.

341
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,905
But guess what?

342
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:25,440
Now I want to see
Love Actually again.

343
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:26,541
But it's at the bottom
of the queue.

344
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:27,776
Oh no!
What do I do?

345
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:29,544
What I do is this:

346
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:31,380
I go online,
I go "click, click, click,"

347
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:33,148
and I change the order
of the queue

348
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,283
so that I can see Love Actually
as soon as I want to.

349
00:11:35,285 --> 00:11:37,552
It's so easy, Ryan.

350
00:11:37,554 --> 00:11:40,155
Do you really not know
how Netflix works?

351
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,257
I guess I forgot.

352
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,060
You're such a ditz.

353
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:49,398
Ryan, well done.
2 minutes, 42 seconds.

354
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,966
Additionally, Pam, you win ten

355
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:52,768
because she said "awesome"
12 times.

356
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,803
And Jim, you win five

357
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,272
because she mentioned
six romantic comedies.

358
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:59,241
Okay, let's do this thing!

359
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:00,442
I'll go summon the troops.

360
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:02,310
Maybe we should test this first,

361
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,012
Letterman-style.

362
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,147
Throw a TV over.

363
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,983
We measured it once.

364
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:10,919
Go buy some watermelons.

365
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,888
Seedless?

366
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,656
Just...

367
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,697
Creed is eating an apple.

368
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:24,332
I found a potato.

369
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,102
Hey, Creed.

370
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:28,503
Hey!

371
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,572
- Hi.
- Hello.

372
00:12:36,946 --> 00:12:38,346
Yes!

373
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:39,581
Here you go.

374
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,649
Nice.

375
00:12:42,385 --> 00:12:43,685
I don't know this place

376
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:44,853
as well as I thought I did.

377
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:47,589
I'm getting cleaned out.

378
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:48,690
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

379
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:49,758
Drop that sucker.

380
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,594
Yeah, bingo!

381
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,095
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

382
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:55,730
Oh, crap!

383
00:12:57,768 --> 00:12:59,734
Deactivate the car alarm,
clean up the mess.

384
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:00,802
Okay.

385
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:01,837
Find out whose car that is.

386
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,904
If it's Stanley's,

387
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,706
call the offices
of James P. Albini.

388
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,841
See if he handles hate crimes.

389
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:06,842
Got it.

390
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:07,843
Also, take apart the trampoline,

391
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:08,844
stick it in the bailer.

392
00:13:08,846 --> 00:13:09,945
We're not allowed
to use the bailer.

393
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Have Patch do it...

394
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:13,014
or the sea monster.

395
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,583
I'm on it!

396
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,084
Eh...

397
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,222
I'm temporarily lifting
the shun.

398
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:21,289
Thank you.

399
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,290
It means nothing.

400
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,458
I need you to do something
for me.

401
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,626
Anything.

402
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:25,827
Okay, calm down.

403
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:27,195
I need you to acquire

404
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:30,265
an inflatable house
and/or castle.

405
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,566
You mean a moon bounce?

406
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:33,101
What do you think?
You've got an hour.

407
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,870
I'm gonna need petty cash.

408
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:36,304
Shunning resumed.

409
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:39,374
Do you... do you want
a drawbridge?

410
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:40,642
Un-shun.

411
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:43,979
Yeah, that sounds good.
Re-shun.

412
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:47,983
Oh, yeah, this is much better.

413
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,651
Safer.

414
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,052
An excellent decision.

415
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:53,054
Yes.
Thank you for seeing that.

416
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,155
When you land,

417
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,757
try and land
like an eight-year-old.

418
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,726
These bouncy castles
are not designed for adults.

419
00:13:57,728 --> 00:13:59,127
I don't know
if I want to do this.

420
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,161
Do you want to do another test?

421
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,396
I got plenty of watermelons
in my trunk.

422
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:02,998
No.

423
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,599
No more;
the tests are going terrible.

424
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:06,368
If we keep doing them,
I'm not gonna want to jump.

425
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:10,305
This is about doing,
not thinking.

426
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,306
Right, doing!

427
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,508
Totally doing!
It's rock and roll!

428
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,676
Rock and roll!
Yeah!

429
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:15,911
You're right;
I'm not thinking.

430
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:18,914
Yes, yeah!

431
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,558
I am ready to do this!

432
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,961
I'm ready to make a point!

433
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:34,429
Hey, guys, listen up.

434
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,431
Michael is up on the roof

435
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:38,033
and acting strange.

436
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,435
Whoa, what's the situation?

437
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:42,370
Un-shun.

438
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:44,606
I think he's suffering
from depression.

439
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:45,807
Re-shun.

440
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:47,342
Okay, when's the shunning thing
gonna end?

441
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,611
Un-shun... never!
Re-shun.

442
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:50,912
I think he wants you all

443
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,280
to come out to the parking lot

444
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:53,448
and watch him die.

445
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,317
Is it nice outside?

446
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:56,618
It's gorgeous.
Let's go!

447
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,652
Do I need my jacket?

448
00:14:57,654 --> 00:14:59,087
No, really, it's very nice.

449
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,188
Come on!

450
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,656
Will I be too warm
in a long sleeve T?

451
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:03,658
Everyone's gonna be fine
in exactly what they're wearing!

452
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,893
Let's go!

453
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,863
Let's go!

454
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:14,803
Come on, hurry up, you guys!

455
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:16,071
My life!

456
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:18,840
Oh, my life...

457
00:15:18,842 --> 00:15:21,176
Michael, what's wrong?

458
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:22,877
Everything's wrong.

459
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,413
The stress of my modern office

460
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:28,149
has caused me to go
into a depression.

461
00:15:28,151 --> 00:15:30,185
Depression?

462
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:33,555
Isn't that just a fancy word
for feeling bummed out?

463
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,056
Dwight, you ignorant slut.

464
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:38,393
Depression is
a very serious illness.

465
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:43,565
Over 32,000 people
commit suicide every year,

466
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,034
according to a 2004 study.

467
00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:47,869
Is that the last year to date
it was available?

468
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:48,870
Yes.

469
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:52,974
My head is in such pain
and turmoil!

470
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:54,876
Don't do anything rash.

471
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:56,645
Dwight, where are
the warehouse guys?

472
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,747
I didn't...

473
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,718
I didn't think you need them
for this part.

474
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,787
Okay... that's...

475
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,589
- You said to just...
- That's the whole point, dummy.

476
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,224
Okay, I'm on it.

477
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:10,425
Okay.

478
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,495
Attention blue collar workers!

479
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,898
What are the odds that this

480
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,266
is in any way real?

481
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,236
I'd say, like, 10,000 to 1.

482
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:24,372
Okay, I'd like ten bucks
on those odds.

483
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:28,376
If someone gives you
10,000 to 1 on anything,

484
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,145
you take it.

485
00:16:30,147 --> 00:16:33,448
If John Mellencamp
ever wins an Oscar,

486
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,485
I am going to be
a very rich dude.

487
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:40,155
Michael's up on the roof

488
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:42,357
and he's acting strange!

489
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,325
Oh, my life!

490
00:16:44,327 --> 00:16:45,860
Michael, what's wrong?

491
00:16:45,862 --> 00:16:48,029
Everything's wrong, Dwight!

492
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:50,398
The stress of my modern office

493
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,000
has made me depressed.

494
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:53,034
Depressed?

495
00:16:53,036 --> 00:16:54,335
Isn't that just a fancy word

496
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:56,004
for feeling bummed out?

497
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:57,505
Dwight, you ignorant slut.

498
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:58,773
Well, you know,

499
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:00,341
the first performance
was a little off.

500
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:02,077
But I really think
they hit their stride

501
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,545
in the second show.

502
00:17:03,547 --> 00:17:05,146
Um...

503
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:07,449
Might even bring my parents
tomorrow to the matinee.

504
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:09,084
And that is why...

505
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:11,152
Oh, excuse me.
It's my favorite part.

506
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,253
I am going to jump off
this roof.

507
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:13,855
This is just offensive.

508
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:15,223
At least we're outside.

509
00:17:15,225 --> 00:17:16,224
Hey, check it out.

510
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:17,726
There's a castle over there.

511
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:20,762
Oh, my God.
There is a castle.

512
00:17:20,764 --> 00:17:23,631
No, there's nothing to see
over there, people.

513
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,266
There's nothing to see.

514
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:28,203
They found the castle, Michael.

515
00:17:28,205 --> 00:17:29,971
Damn it.

516
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:33,975
Oh, God.

517
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,110
Oh, my God!

518
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:36,377
He's gonna jump.

519
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,080
Oh.

520
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:41,382
He's going to kill himself

521
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:42,584
pretending to kill himself.

522
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,185
Yeah.

523
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,057
Hey, uh, Michael.

524
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,894
Don't jump on the bouncy castle.

525
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,929
You can't do that

526
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,532
'cause you are going to get
horribly, horribly injured.

527
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,168
Hey, Michael.

528
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,036
I have a present for you

529
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:03,671
but you have to come down
and get it.

530
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:06,374
What is it?

531
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,843
Come down and open it
and you'll see.

532
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,578
Dwight, find out
what the present is.

533
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,114
Okay, uh...
I don't see anything.

534
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:14,449
She might be bluffing.

535
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:15,450
Dwight.

536
00:18:15,452 --> 00:18:17,185
What are you...

537
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:19,020
Oh.

538
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:21,122
It's, uh...

539
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:25,960
A Repliee Q1 Expo female robot.

540
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:27,595
They're only available in Japan.

541
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:29,197
Dwight, you are such a liar.

542
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:30,565
Pam, really, what is it?

543
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,401
Mike, this is the opposite
of safety.

544
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,136
You jump, you're gonna
seriously hurt yourself.

545
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:38,606
You told me that I lead a...

546
00:18:38,608 --> 00:18:42,443
a cushy, wimpy, NERF life.

547
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:46,347
Yeah, but I never said
you had nothing to live for.

548
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:48,016
What do I have to live for?

549
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:50,485
A lot... of things.

550
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:55,323
Uh, you, uh...

551
00:19:00,996 --> 00:19:02,597
What about Jan?

552
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,167
Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.

553
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,203
It's going good, right?

554
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:11,406
It's complicated with Jan.

555
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:13,007
And I don't know where I stand

556
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:15,043
or what I want.

557
00:19:15,045 --> 00:19:17,612
The sex isn't nearly as good
as it used to be.

558
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,747
Mike...

559
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:21,049
you're a very brave man.

560
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:24,652
I mean, it takes courage
just to be you.

561
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:27,856
To get out of bed
every single day

562
00:19:27,858 --> 00:19:31,259
knowing full well
you gotta be you.

563
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:33,661
Do you really mean that?

564
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:35,396
I couldn't do it.

565
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,999
I ain't that strong
and I ain't that brave.

566
00:19:38,001 --> 00:19:39,133
I'm braver than you?

567
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,236
Way braver!

568
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:42,770
You Braveheart, man.

569
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:47,942
I Braveheart.

570
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:51,312
I am.

571
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:52,647
Come on down, okay?

572
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,183
Okay.

573
00:19:55,185 --> 00:19:57,619
Pam, I'm coming down
to get my present.

574
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:03,024
An office is as safe
as the people in it.

575
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,859
And sometimes those people

576
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:07,262
can drive you to do crazy things

577
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:11,299
to show the dangers
of the office.

578
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:14,702
That's the danger
I found myself in today.

579
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:19,007
I saved a life... my own.

580
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,842
Am I a hero?

581
00:20:24,747 --> 00:20:25,880
I really can't say.

582
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:27,448
But, yes.
