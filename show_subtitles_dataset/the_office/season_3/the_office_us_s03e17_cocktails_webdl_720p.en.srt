1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,904
Can you confirm
that the straps are tight?

2
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:06,105
Yes.

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:08,341
But this one's a little...

4
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:11,844
And now the chains!

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,646
A lot of people think
that magic camp

6
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:15,114
is just for kids.

7
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,149
And that's why so many

8
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,650
other people
in my class were kids.

9
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:19,419
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

10
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:23,256
It's, um, really for anybody

11
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:26,793
with a dream,
and a belief in magic,

12
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:29,929
and a little extra time
after school.

13
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:33,933
Magic, magic, magic, magic...

14
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:36,202
And now, Michael the Magic

15
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:39,939
will attempt to escape
from extreme bondage.

16
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:41,941
Can he do it?

17
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:43,576
I don't see how he can.

18
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:44,811
I know how.

19
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:46,846
He'd dislocate his shoulder
and slip his arm out.

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,948
No! No.

21
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,617
Everyone now count down with me.

22
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,652
Three!
Sorry.

23
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:53,886
Sorry, quickly.

24
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,055
So is it true
that if you can't get out,

25
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,757
you don't want anyone
to help you?

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,758
I will get out.

27
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,160
Oh, yes, I will.

28
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,429
So we shouldn't help you,
no matter how much

29
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,530
you might beg and plead.

30
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,098
No, all right, just...
this is getting hot.

31
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,867
So let's just do this,
okay, ready?

32
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,001
Three!

33
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,136
Two.

34
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:11,137
One!

35
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:12,572
Go!

36
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,963
Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:40,666
Aah!

38
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,435
Is everything okay, Michael?

39
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,804
Yes.

40
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:49,775
I cannot tell you
how I plan to escape.

41
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,278
Other than by using magic.

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,181
That is the magician's code.

43
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,417
Help.

44
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,119
Separately,
on an unrelated note,

45
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:04,624
if you happen to find
a small brass key...

46
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,247
All right, ready?

47
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:31,017
Come on, guys,
early worm gets the worm.

48
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,585
Another worm?

49
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:33,653
Like, are they friends?

50
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:34,987
It's early bird gets the worm.

51
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:35,988
Okay.

52
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,058
Pam, would you smell my breath?

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,126
No. No.

54
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:42,128
Let me smell.

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,966
Good, not great.

56
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,067
Michael, you go to parties
all the time.

57
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,669
Why is tonight so special?

58
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,539
Well, tonight is so special
because my boss's boss's boss,

59
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,642
the CFO, not his initials,
common mistake,

60
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,045
is having a little shindig
for all the managers

61
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:02,181
in the company, and Jan and I
are going as a couple.

62
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,016
For the first time.

63
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,085
So it's kind of
our coming out party.

64
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:07,253
Really.

65
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:09,956
And that is why tonight
is so special.

66
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,591
Jimbo, last chance carpool.

67
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:13,092
Oh, no thanks, I think
Karen and I'll take my car.

68
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:14,360
Sure? Might be a good idea.

69
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,262
If we all went together
we could save some gas.

70
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:17,697
Have fun. Long trip!
Thanks.

71
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,965
Play some games?
Oh.

72
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:20,933
Um... no, we're good.

73
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,134
I Spy.
Yeah.

74
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,470
Why don't I wanna go?

75
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:25,972
Didn't expect to need a reason,

76
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:26,973
so let me think here.

77
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:27,974
Um...

78
00:03:29,344 --> 00:03:30,643
I don't know
any of these people.

79
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,078
It's an obligation.

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,714
I don't like talking paper
in my free time.

81
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:36,082
Or in my work time.

82
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:39,952
And... did I use
the word "pointless?"

83
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:42,388
Thanks for inviting me along.

84
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,522
Oh, sure.

85
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,957
Really didn't give it
any thought.

86
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,626
Wait, should you be going?

87
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,963
Hey-wo, you!

88
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:52,365
Michael?
Hey, buttercup.

89
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,667
I am on my way,
should be there in about 15...

90
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,369
Let's just blow this party off.

91
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:57,570
That's what she said.
Yeah.

92
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,505
Am I on speaker phone?

93
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,607
Ah, yes you are.

94
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,809
Is anybody else...
Hello, Jan!

95
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,011
Hi, Dwight.

96
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:06,445
Okay, Michael,
take me off speakerphone.

97
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,247
No le problem.

98
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,517
Okay, let's just go
to a motel...

99
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,585
Okay!

100
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:13,986
And, like, rip into each other

101
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,388
like we did
on that black sand beach

102
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,489
in Jamaica.

103
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:17,790
Hey, Jan?

104
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:20,626
Jan, this party is actually
a very big step for us.

105
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:23,029
So I...
Still on speaker?

106
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:26,132
Um... I don't know.

107
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,400
Are cameras there?

108
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:28,501
Maybe.

109
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,269
All right, see you soon.

110
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:31,637
Okay.
Talk to you later, Jan!

111
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,506
All right, bye.

112
00:04:33,508 --> 00:04:34,840
Hey, Michael left early,

113
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,776
so a bunch of us
are gonna go to Poor Richard's

114
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,077
for happy hour, you should come.

115
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,413
I can't.

116
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,581
My brother just unloaded
the Jet Skis

117
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,984
and he kinda took a bath, so...

118
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,519
We're gonna go get hammered.

119
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:49,155
Okay, well, we're going
to a bar.

120
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,492
Hey.

121
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,461
You have to come
to stuff with me.

122
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,596
I'm serious.

123
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,698
If you're gonna be my boyfriend,

124
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,800
you have to do boyfriend things.

125
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:04,804
Okay.

126
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:08,741
I have decided that
I'm going to be more honest.

127
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:12,111
I'm gonna start telling people
what I want directly.

128
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:15,414
So look out world,
'cause ol' Pamie

129
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,616
is getting what she wants.

130
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,618
And don't call me Pamie.

131
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,687
Beauty.

132
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,522
Thank you, sir.

133
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,257
Ensalada.
Thank you.

134
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,463
You're dressed
exactly like the servants.

135
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,198
Shut up.

136
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,299
Okay, change shirts with me.

137
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:34,900
What?
Give me your shirt.

138
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,702
No, but yours won't fit me.

139
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,070
I don't care.

140
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,542
This is stupid.

141
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,378
Ah... wow.

142
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,814
Here.

143
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,182
Don't let my jacket...

144
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,051
Don't give me that.

145
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:54,120
That would have been
really embarrassing.

146
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,221
Yes.

147
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:56,222
Crisis averted.

148
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:57,389
Okay.

149
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,196
Oh.

150
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,664
That duck is so cute.

151
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:10,870
Hey, Pam.

152
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,340
Oscar.
Angela.

153
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:18,043
Uh, hi!

154
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,380
Actually, it's polite
to arrive early.

155
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,282
And smart.

156
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:25,551
Only really good friends
show up early.

157
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,053
Ergo de facto,
go to a party early,

158
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,289
become a really good friend.

159
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,557
Oh! Uh, potato salad.

160
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,758
Oh.
That's from both of us.

161
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,759
No, it's not.

162
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,594
It's my bowl.
Wonderful.

163
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:38,798
Let's, uh, see
where we can put this.

164
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,399
Okay.

165
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,667
Oh, you know what,
you probably wanna leave

166
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,669
the cover on
until the guests get here.

167
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:47,306
It's been sitting
in my car all day.

168
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:49,208
Sun beating down
on the mayonnaise...

169
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,246
Just... you never know.

170
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,916
Kevin, you and Stacey
set a date yet?

171
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,050
Yeah.

172
00:06:58,052 --> 00:06:59,718
Oh, my God, when is it?

173
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,521
It's complicated.

174
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,124
I would appreciate
some space on this.

175
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,559
Hey!

176
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:08,227
Hey!

177
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:09,795
You made it.

178
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,497
Yeah, you said
it was important, so...

179
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,666
It is.

180
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:14,834
How's it going?

181
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,535
What's up, Pam?
Hey, Kenny.

182
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,270
Sorry about the Jet Skis.

183
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,841
You guys all want
a round? On me?

184
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:23,108
Yeah!

185
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,176
Let's get you a drink.

186
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:25,544
Thanks, man.
I'm thirsty.

187
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,979
No, thank you, Roy, I...

188
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:29,982
You should get a round, Ryan.

189
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:34,653
Oh, you know that line
on the top of the shrimp?

190
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,657
That's feces.

191
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,658
Whatcha looking for?

192
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,693
Did you bring dip?

193
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:43,162
I'm sure that it's catered.

194
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,664
I need you
to sign these, Michael.

195
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,633
That's a waiver
of some of your rights.

196
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,768
You should read it carefully.

197
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,170
It releases the company
in the event

198
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:52,805
that our relationship
in your opinion,

199
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,640
or in reality,
interferes with work.

200
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:58,244
You get a copy, I get a copy,
and a third copy goes to HR.

201
00:07:58,246 --> 00:07:59,845
Awesome.

202
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,947
I'm gonna frame mine.

203
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,082
I could frame yours too.

204
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:05,384
You realize this is...
this is a legal document

205
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:07,419
that says you can't sue
the company?

206
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:10,222
Over our love.

207
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:13,859
I've... never told you
that I love you.

208
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,661
You don't have to, Jan.

209
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,596
This contract says it all.

210
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,299
I am taking a calculated risk.

211
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,533
What's the upside?

212
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,802
I overcome my nausea,
fall deeply in love,

213
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:26,238
babies, normalcy,
no more self-loathing.

214
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,709
Downside, I, uh,
date Michael Scott publicly

215
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,112
and collapse into myself
like a dying star.

216
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,216
What's this over the I?

217
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:40,286
It's a heart.

218
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:44,390
Why is this so hard?

219
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:47,526
That's what she said.

220
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,595
Oh, my God.
What am I saying?

221
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,964
I love this woman!

222
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh, no, Michael,
please, Michael, please.

223
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,347
Do you ever watch
Battlestar Galactica?

224
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:09,415
No.
No?

225
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:10,950
Then you're an idiot.

226
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:11,984
Hello, Michael.

227
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:15,154
Rachel, boy,
do you clean up good.

228
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:17,790
Place looks great
with all the lights on.

229
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,224
And everything
actually looks bigger

230
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,726
with people in it, weird.

231
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,163
Jan, glad you could make it.

232
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:25,931
Oh, of course, of course, David.

233
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,299
Do you remember, uh,
Michael Scott?

234
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,600
Of course I do.
From Scranton branch.

235
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:29,601
How are you, Michael?

236
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,203
Jan and I are lovers.

237
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,405
That feels so good
to finally say that out loud.

238
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,809
David, can I, um,
speak to you privately

239
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:38,877
for just a moment, please?

240
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,979
Excuse me.

241
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,114
Okay.

242
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,919
Oh.

243
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:53,325
No. Actually, one of these
is supposed to be a light.

244
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,994
Oh, sorry.

245
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,098
So the merger goes smoothly,
or...

246
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,200
It did.
"Like butter."

247
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:02,835
Mike Myers, SNL.

248
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:04,436
You should ask Karen,
she was one of them.

249
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,904
Yeah, I'm the only one left.

250
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,474
Everybody else
was either fired or quit.

251
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,209
And there's one
in anger management.

252
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,244
Yeah, but you're great now,
right?

253
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,446
We're all great.

254
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,914
Aren't we great?

255
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,416
We're good.

256
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:20,486
Michael, st...
please stop that, okay?

257
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,553
Uh, can I get anyone anything?

258
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,455
I could go
for an appe-tease-er, yep.

259
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,190
Martini, please.
Bagel bites or something.

260
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,092
Rachel, your house is beautiful.

261
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,093
Oh, thank you.

262
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,094
What's the square footage?

263
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,796
Wow.

264
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,531
Uh, about 5,000.

265
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:33,966
Does that include the garage?

266
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:37,202
Dwight, that's not appropriate.

267
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,937
I don't know.
It's a common question.

268
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,839
David, how much
did this house cost?

269
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:45,344
These old colonials
are great... when they're sound.

270
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,713
I'd love to, uh,
take a look around.

271
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,481
I'll show you around, sure.

272
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,183
Cool, let's start
with the banisters.

273
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,918
Hey.

274
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,887
Do you see that guy behind you

275
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:57,589
in the blue blazer
against the wall?

276
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,824
Mm, yup.

277
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:00,459
That's Drake.

278
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:02,561
And just so you know,
I don't wanna be weird

279
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,764
or anything, but, um,
we used to date.

280
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,433
Oh.

281
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:09,234
Okay, cool.
Thanks for telling me that.

282
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:10,669
And it didn't end well.

283
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,238
Gotcha.

284
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,274
All right.

285
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,180
This was a gift...

286
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,782
from Lee lacocca.

287
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:26,485
20-year-old,
single malt Scotch.

288
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:30,255
Here is to Mr. Iacocca
and his failed experiment,

289
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,357
the DeLorean.

290
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,596
Are you okay?

291
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:38,697
Yeah!

292
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:39,798
Do you have any ice?

293
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,835
Sure.

294
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:44,336
How about some Splenda?

295
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,507
1, 2, 3, up chickens!

296
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,309
Down chickens!

297
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,310
Uh, I think I heard
the quarter over here.

298
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:52,411
Where?
On this side.

299
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:54,780
No, it is definitely
under one of these hands.

300
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,048
I kind of heard it
on Roy's side too.

301
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,816
No, it is here.

302
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,218
Not here.

303
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,719
Not here. Not here.

304
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,454
Not here.

305
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,056
Good thing you didn't listen
to me.

306
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,190
Yeah, close one.

307
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:08,260
Not here. Not here.

308
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:09,862
Okay, it's either here or here.

309
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,268
Not here.

310
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:18,904
Yes!

311
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:19,938
Nice job.

312
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,740
I can read you like a book.

313
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:22,774
Oh, yeah?

314
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,076
You can't keep anything from me.

315
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,212
Bottom's up.

316
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,081
Hey, Creed.
Hey.

317
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,082
What's up, Creed?

318
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,150
What are you guys up to?

319
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:33,218
Ah, hello.

320
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,653
You're the man, buddy.

321
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:37,923
I run a small fake ID company
from my car

322
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,058
with a laminating machine
that I swiped

323
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,627
from the sheriff's station.

324
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,464
Huh, yeah.

325
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,599
These studs
are way too far apart.

326
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,837
What's in here?

327
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,238
Ah, it's a guest room.

328
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,641
Just the one window?

329
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:57,976
Oh, I must get that.

330
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,144
You'll have to excuse me.

331
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:00,345
Are those real pearls?

332
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,547
Uh, yes.

333
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:02,781
They're...

334
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:08,187
Yes.

335
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,059
Good.

336
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,861
Well, it was nice
meeting you guys.

337
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,664
Take care.

338
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,166
Well, if you're wondering why
his wife was staring daggers

339
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,868
at me, it's because
I kinda saw him

340
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,369
for a little bit
when they were separated.

341
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,171
Oh.

342
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,472
Didn't notice.

343
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,541
Really? I thought
it was so obvious.

344
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,610
I'm glad it didn't make you
uncomfortable.

345
00:13:31,612 --> 00:13:33,212
No, it was before I knew you,

346
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:34,846
so... it's fine.

347
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,849
Wow, this one really smells
like vanilla.

348
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,850
Mm.
Check that out.

349
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:39,851
That's nice.

350
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,120
You and the Mrs.
should join us

351
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:44,656
at Sandals Jamaica
next Christmas.

352
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,492
I... Michael, I think
David probably wants

353
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,161
to spend Christmas here
with his family.

354
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,295
Oh, yeah.

355
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,297
They don't allow kids
at Sandals.

356
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,133
They are... are
persona non grata.

357
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,435
Please stop.

358
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:58,136
They're... uh,
but it's fun.

359
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,404
It is an awesome place.

360
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,340
You would not believe
how low this girl can limbo.

361
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,108
David, I'm sorry.

362
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,309
You're just gonna
have to excuse us

363
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,877
for just a couple minutes,
sorry.

364
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,346
Okay, okay.

365
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,714
Excuse me.

366
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,115
What's going on?

367
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:11,383
What is it?

368
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:12,451
Sorry.

369
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,554
What... what's the matter?

370
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,889
What's...
Come here.

371
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:21,693
Just... just... just... just...

372
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:26,665
What are you doing?

373
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,233
Don't you know what I'm doing?

374
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,369
Yes, but you could tell me.

375
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,504
What are... what is that?

376
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,573
Why are you... why are we going
in the bathroom?

377
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,608
I thought this is where
you liked your privacy.

378
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,676
Shut up.

379
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,557
What has gotten into you?

380
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,925
No, no, no, no!
What?

381
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,327
Come on, let's go back
to the party.

382
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,029
Come on, wait,
let me just do my dress.

383
00:14:57,031 --> 00:14:58,964
Don't take that... no!
Stop it! Stop it.

384
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,133
Jan, no, no, no!
Michael!

385
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,168
No means please don't.

386
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,603
Slam me up against the wall,
right here.

387
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,338
I'm not gonna slam you
up against anything.

388
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,040
Oh, please, I want you so...
You're acting inappropriate.

389
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:10,008
I'm acting inappropriate?
Jan... yeah.

390
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,410
Forget it, get away from me.

391
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:18,684
Here.

392
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:19,818
Hey.

393
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,986
Where have you been all night?

394
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,421
I was looking forward
to hanging out with you.

395
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,089
I was...

396
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:27,125
Hey, don't you have a daughter?

397
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,995
Yes.

398
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,470
Oh, good, you're up.

399
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,705
Hey, who makes' this chair?

400
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:42,341
I don't know,
it was here when I was born.

401
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:45,077
Hmm.
I want one.

402
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,079
Really good, solid construction.

403
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:48,080
It's comfortable.

404
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,916
What is this? Oak?

405
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:53,318
I don't know.

406
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,587
What do you know?

407
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,331
God, I hate these parties.

408
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,867
You wanna sneak out back
and shoot some hoops?

409
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,639
Meet me outside in two minutes.

410
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,377
You stay here and have fun,
'cause I'm gonna go out back

411
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,112
and shoot hoops
with David Wallace.

412
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:22,047
Okay.

413
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:25,150
Oh, um, don't mention
that you and I are dating,

414
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,686
'cause I think he might
still have feelings for me.

415
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:28,987
Wallace?

416
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,555
What the hell?

417
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:32,557
Have you dated, like,
every guy here?

418
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,798
Wow.

419
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,133
Okay.

420
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:42,134
You got me.

421
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,668
I so got you.

422
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,003
So, none of them.

423
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,772
Of course not.

424
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:50,208
I mean, you're kind of,
like, my first.

425
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,843
Really?

426
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,545
Oh, my God, it's so easy,
it's not even fun.

427
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:54,846
Okay.

428
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,785
Hey, Jan.

429
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:01,319
Not too good.

430
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,323
Did you get a chance to try

431
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,859
Michael's homemade potato salad?

432
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,728
Rachel thinks that I brought
homemade potato salad.

433
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,397
And I just picked it up
at the supermarket.

434
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,500
It's funny, I wish I could make
potato salad that good.

435
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,436
It's just potatoes
and mayonnaise.

436
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:20,005
There's something wrong
with Jan.

437
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:24,910
What's, uh, what's
with Jan and Michael?

438
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:27,312
I don't know.

439
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,448
Where to begin?

440
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,662
My ball.

441
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:45,263
The chimney's in decent shape.

442
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,666
Not great, I found
some termite damage

443
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:50,168
in a crawlspace
and some structural flaws

444
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,673
in the foundation,
so all in all...

445
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,509
it was a pretty fun
cocktail party.

446
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,847
What?

447
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,149
I want us to make it.

448
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,650
I want a fresh start.

449
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,252
That's awesome.

450
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,420
That's what I want.

451
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,890
Okay, but in order
for us to make it,

452
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,959
there can't be any secrets
between us.

453
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:15,827
The... I didn't do anything.

454
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,063
Ask anybody, I totally could've,

455
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:19,164
and I didn't at all.

456
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,899
Just listen.

457
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:23,668
Remember that casino night
about a month

458
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,303
before we were supposed
to get married?

459
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,005
I kissed Jim.

460
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,107
What?

461
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,244
He told me how he felt,
and I guess I had feelings too,

462
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:33,345
and we kissed.

463
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,513
Jim came on to you?

464
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:35,647
Just listen.

465
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:36,748
No, I am listening!

466
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,049
That's the problem,
I'm listening!

467
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,117
Don't yell.

468
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,785
Don't yell?

469
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,358
This is over.

470
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,660
Yeah, you're right,
this is so over.

471
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,562
You kidding me, Pam?

472
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,898
Come on!

473
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,500
God!

474
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,703
Damn Jet Skis!

475
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,410
Our first fight.

476
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,948
If this is about what happened
in the bathroom,

477
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,950
there was no place to cuddle.

478
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:14,252
I feel sick.

479
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,154
You didn't have any
of the potato salad, did you?

480
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:19,324
You know, we were good when we
were just running around.

481
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,559
You know, in secret.

482
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,360
It was wrong,
and it was exciting.

483
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:26,731
And maybe it was a mistake
to take it public.

484
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,171
Well, if that's the way
you feel,

485
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,840
my lady, then you
have hurt me greatly.

486
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,609
Michael.
Greatly.

487
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,010
Please don't cry.

488
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,178
I'm not going to cry.

489
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,948
I feel like it,
but I am not going to.

490
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,517
Why don't you just take
your stupid love contract

491
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,985
and tear it up
into a million pieces?

492
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,653
It was never
a love contract, Michael.

493
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,221
And besides, I've already given
a copy to David

494
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,489
and it would be
just as embarrassing

495
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,725
to get it back from him
as it was handing it to him.

496
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,061
I want the house, Jan!
I want the picket fence.

497
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:58,797
I want the ketchup fights,
and the tickling,

498
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,566
and the giggling.

499
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,103
I didn't mean it, okay?

500
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,405
I was... I was tired.
Whatever.

501
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:09,507
I'm tired,
and I didn't eat enough.

502
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,976
You didn't mean it.
And that's all.

503
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:12,510
That's was it.
That's it, you didn't mean it.

504
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,045
No, I didn't.
So...

505
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:18,483
That's all, I'm just saying
I didn't mean it.

506
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,387
I love you, Jan.

507
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,755
Okay.

508
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,996
Don't break up, you guys.

509
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,233
You're great together.

510
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,655
Are they gonna call the cops?

511
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:59,157
No, I paid them off.

512
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,427
Jet Ski money?

513
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,029
All of it.

514
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:06,097
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
