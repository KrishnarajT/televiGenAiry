1
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:05,831
So, do you want to see it
or not?

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:06,799
I don't know.

3
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:09,301
I don't like
Friday night crowds.

4
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:11,804
Oh, my God.
You're, like, agoraphobic.

5
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:12,638
Agoraphobic?

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,673
- Really?
- Yeah!

7
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:16,642
You would rather
sit on your couch

8
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:19,912
then go out to a movie
with your awesome girlfriend.

9
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:20,980
Absolutely correct.

10
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:22,114
Later, Jim.

11
00:00:22,116 --> 00:00:24,283
- Kev, have a good weekend.
- Bye.

12
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:26,852
Okay, so this is
what's gonna happen.

13
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:29,588
And we're gonna go to dinner...
- Okay.

14
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,656
And then we're gonna go
to the movies.

15
00:00:30,658 --> 00:00:32,157
- Sounds good.
- Hey, Halpert!

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,127
Hey.

17
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:39,932
Roy!
Ahh!

18
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,066
Roy, don't!

19
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:43,702
God!

20
00:00:50,143 --> 00:00:53,178
Pam, please call security.

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,180
Every day for eight years,

22
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,982
I have brought
pepper spray into this office

23
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:59,885
to protect myself
and my fellow employees.

24
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,987
And every day for eight years,

25
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,722
people have laughed at me.

26
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:06,358
Well.
Who's laughing now?

27
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:43,862
No need for consternation.
Everything is under control.

28
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:44,897
Michael, last Friday

29
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:46,131
one of your employees

30
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,033
attacked another employee
in your office.

31
00:01:48,035 --> 00:01:49,968
It was a crime of passion, Jan,

32
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,937
not a disgruntled employee.

33
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:54,073
Everyone here
is extremely gruntled.

34
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:56,775
Is Toby there?

35
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:58,811
- No.
- I'm here, Jan.

36
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,113
Wh-what is
the situation, Toby?

37
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:03,749
Well, we fired Roy, obviously.

38
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:06,618
And Jim won't press charges
against Roy or the company.

39
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,953
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:11,023
Um, but now apparently
Darryl has some issue with...

41
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,792
No, he has been wanting a raise
for a couple of months

42
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:16,595
and he's just using
this Roy thing as leverage.

43
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:17,963
All right, well, are
you gonna take care of this?

44
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,331
Yeppers.

45
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,167
What did I tell you
about "yeppers?"

46
00:02:23,403 --> 00:02:25,037
I don't remember.

47
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,439
I told you not to say it.
Do you remember that?

48
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:29,708
Ye... sh.

49
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:35,380
I really don't want
to talk about it.

50
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:37,349
I don't mean to be rude,

51
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:41,153
but I just... I don't want
to comment on what happened.

52
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:45,591
It sucked.

53
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:51,630
I guess...
all things considered...

54
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,400
I was lucky Dwight was there.

55
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:58,470
And Roy was lucky that Dwight
only used pepper spray,

56
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:01,340
and not the nunchucks
or the throwing stars.

57
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,213
Hey, man, I never got
a chance to thank you.

58
00:03:09,983 --> 00:03:12,718
For stopping Roy.

59
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:16,588
"Thank you" not necessary,
and thus not accepted.

60
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,125
I saw someone breaking
the law, and I interceded.

61
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:21,827
Okay.

62
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,397
Um... got you something.

63
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,232
Don't want it.

64
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:30,869
Don't want it. Won't open it.
Don't need it. Won't take it.

65
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:33,505
Citizens do not accept
prizes for being citizens.

66
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:43,549
It was a little glass display
case for his bobble head.

67
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:45,784
That would have made
his evening, I think.

68
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:50,088
He saves my life, I get him
a box for his desk toy.

69
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,623
Even Steven.

70
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,559
No, don't call me a hero.

71
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:55,694
Do you know who the real
heroes are?

72
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:58,130
The guys who wake up
every morning

73
00:03:58,132 --> 00:03:59,998
and go into their normal jobs,

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,167
and get a distress call
from the commissioner,

75
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,102
and take off their glasses
and change into capes,

76
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:06,371
and fly around fighting crime.

77
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:08,273
Those are the real heroes.

78
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:09,441
Angela.

79
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:12,377
Roy's check, he's coming
in later to pick it up.

80
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,412
Man...

81
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:15,714
I cannot believe
I missed the fight.

82
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,082
It was crazy.

83
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:21,086
You saw it?
Describe it, please.

84
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,023
Well...

85
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:26,959
I heard some shouting.

86
00:04:26,961 --> 00:04:28,994
And I look over,
and Roy's by reception.

87
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:31,196
And you could just tell
he's gonna punch somebody.

88
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:32,998
Jim says something.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,299
Roy stomps all over there.

90
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,400
All of a sudden... bam!

91
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:37,069
Roy goes down,
and Dwight's standing there

92
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:38,270
like an action hero.

93
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:39,938
Oh!

94
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,575
It was insane.

95
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:47,145
Well... good for Dwight.

96
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:48,847
Okay, I want you to be Darryl

97
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:50,115
and ask me for a raise,

98
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:51,283
because I need to try out

99
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:53,118
some of these
negotiation tactics on you.

100
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,286
Where'd you get that?

101
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:55,587
Wikipedia.

102
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:59,224
Wikipedia is
the best thing ever.

103
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:00,959
Anyone in the world

104
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:03,695
can write anything they want
about any subject.

105
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:06,098
So you know you are getting

106
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,467
the best possible information.

107
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:11,236
Okay, Darryl,
ask me for a raise.

108
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:13,071
Hey, Mike, since Roy left

109
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:14,039
I've been doing a lot more work,

110
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,309
Hmm, well, that's
interesting, Darryl.

111
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:19,177
I think...

112
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:21,280
that maybe you should...

113
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,488
I can't hear you.

114
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:31,423
What I'm saying is that...

115
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:37,129
Still nothing.

116
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:40,065
Okay, see what I did?
- No.

117
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:43,468
By leaning back
and by whispering,

118
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,471
I established a dominant
physical position.

119
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,006
Nice.

120
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:50,409
Okay, let's try another one.
- Okay.

121
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,445
Walking out of the
room unexpectently.

122
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:55,180
And what happens in this one?

123
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:57,416
That's a surprise.

124
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:00,252
- Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
- Can I have a raise?

125
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:08,760
Sex, Steve Martin,
Teri Hatcher. What?

126
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:10,362
What did you say?

127
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:13,231
I didn't say anything, I'm
waiting to see what happened.

128
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:18,537
This is interesting,
what your given.

129
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,572
I saw the perpetrator
advance towards the victim,

130
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,207
at a high rate of speed.

131
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:24,676
His head was thrown back,
his shoulder and arm cocked,

132
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:26,545
indicating an attack position.

133
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:28,880
Perp grabbed the victim,

134
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:30,415
I removed my weapon

135
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,351
from its secure hiding place.

136
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,586
- Which is where?
- Irrelevant.

137
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:36,088
Discharged it at a distance

138
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,422
of a little over a meter,

139
00:06:37,424 --> 00:06:42,160
Into the perpetrators eyes,
nose and face area.

140
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:46,698
Rendering him utterly
and completely disabled.

141
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,167
Then I contacted
the authorities.

142
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,337
The end.

143
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,072
Thanks, Dwight.

144
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:57,509
That is the bravest thing
I have ever heard.

145
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,478
I can't imagine
what I would've done.

146
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,746
I do.

147
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:02,748
You would've left me
to fend for myself.

148
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,549
Like the time we were
on the Ferris wheel

149
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,650
and that kid dropped
a milkshake on me

150
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:06,952
and you just laughed.

151
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,153
Well, that was funny.
That's why.

152
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:09,654
Oh, it was?
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:12,157
that you think a murderer
is in your apartment

154
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,558
in the middle of the night

155
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,760
and you call me
to calm you down...

156
00:07:14,762 --> 00:07:16,461
Can you stop?

157
00:07:16,463 --> 00:07:18,497
Because I'm not gonna do it
anymore, Ryan, I'm not.

158
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:20,565
There's a bunch of people
back there maybe.

159
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,867
I call you
in the middle of the night

160
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:23,869
to tell you that I love you.
- Guys?

161
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:27,005
I don't think Michael
intended to punish me

162
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:29,508
by putting Ryan back here
with Kelly.

163
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:35,447
But if he did
intend that... wow.

164
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:36,548
Genius.

165
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,150
Yeah.

166
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:39,418
You ready for me?

167
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,154
Yes, yeah, absolutely.
Have a seat.

168
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:44,656
You know what?

169
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,324
Actually, let's go
into the conference room.

170
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:49,394
- Okay.
- No, you know what? Let's stay here.

171
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:52,030
No, let's go to the con...

172
00:07:52,032 --> 00:07:54,199
Yeah, let's go
to the conference room.

173
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:59,204
Tactic number six.

174
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:01,273
Change the location
of the meeting

175
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:02,374
at the last second.

176
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:04,743
Totally throws 'em off.

177
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,657
Number 14.
Declining to speak first.

178
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,593
Makes them feel uncomfortable,
puts you in control.

179
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:43,048
I am declining to speak first.

180
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,616
Okay, I'll start.

181
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:45,851
It's pretty simple really.

182
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:48,920
I, um, I think
I deserve a raise.

183
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:51,156
I'm scheduled to get one
in six months,

184
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:53,658
but I'd like that
to be moved up to now.

185
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,095
Hmm.

186
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:59,631
Ohh, Darryl.

187
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:03,635
You are a good worker
and a good man.

188
00:09:03,637 --> 00:09:07,672
I just... you know,
times are tight.

189
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,243
And I just don't think

190
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,311
corporate's going to go
for this right now.

191
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:16,181
Are you wearing lady clothes?

192
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:17,916
What?

193
00:09:17,918 --> 00:09:19,284
Are you wearing lady clothes?

194
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:20,919
Those look like lady pants.

195
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:24,222
No, this is a power suit.

196
00:09:24,224 --> 00:09:26,258
That there's a woman's suit.

197
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,628
I do not buy women's clothes.

198
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,863
Would not make
that mistake again.

199
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:34,032
I'm gonna call Roy, man.
- Okay.

200
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,333
This is gonna make him feel better.
- All right.

201
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:36,668
This is too good!

202
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,803
All right, you know what?

203
00:09:38,805 --> 00:09:40,605
Pam, would you please
tell Darryl

204
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,974
that this is not a woman's suit.

205
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:44,676
Oh, my God.
That's a woman's suit.

206
00:09:44,678 --> 00:09:45,944
You're wearing a woman's suit?

207
00:09:45,946 --> 00:09:49,180
No, I do...
I wear men's suits.

208
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:50,916
Okay, I got this out of a bin.

209
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,617
There were these huge
bins of clothes,

210
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:54,886
and everybody was rifling
through them like crazy,

211
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:57,822
and I grabbed one.

212
00:09:57,824 --> 00:09:59,424
And it fit.

213
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:01,359
So I don't think

214
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:04,362
that is totally
just a woman's suit.

215
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:06,898
At the very least it's bisexual.

216
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,300
Who makes it?

217
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:12,270
Um, MISSterious.

218
00:10:12,272 --> 00:10:14,306
And it is mysterious,

219
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:15,440
because the buttons
are on the wrong side.

220
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:16,841
That's the mystery.

221
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:18,043
It's got shoulder pads.

222
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:19,611
And did you see that lining?

223
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:21,980
Okay, would you stop it, please?

224
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:23,748
So, none of that tipped you off?

225
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,117
It's a European, okay?
It's a European cut.

226
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:28,386
Michael, the pants don't
have any pockets.

227
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,021
No, they don't.
See?

228
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:33,091
Italians don't wear pockets.

229
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:35,694
It's been a really
rough couple of days.

230
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:39,564
This helps a little.

231
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,967
Maybe you want to come over
and raid my closet.

232
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:45,103
No, I don't want to do that because
I'm twice your size anyway.

233
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:47,238
Yeah,
he look like Hillary Clinton.

234
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,907
Let's just do this in 15.

235
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:50,809
Okay. Can you stand
right there for one second.

236
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:52,510
I gotta send some emails.

237
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:55,547
Negotiations are all about
controlling things.

238
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:58,883
About being
in the driver's seat.

239
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:02,721
And... you make one
tiny mistake, you're dead.

240
00:11:02,723 --> 00:11:04,856
I made one tiny mistake.

241
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:06,891
I wore women's clothes.

242
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:11,563
So Karen, how do you feel

243
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:13,832
that Roy tried to kick
your boyfriend's ass

244
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:15,734
over another woman?

245
00:11:15,736 --> 00:11:19,337
I feel great, Kevin.
Thank you.

246
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,773
You must have been
scared out of your mind.

247
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:26,244
It happened so fast,
I didn't have time to be scared.

248
00:11:26,246 --> 00:11:28,279
What happened exactly?

249
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:29,581
I wasn't here,

250
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,317
so I haven't really
heard the whole story.

251
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:34,586
Um, well, Jim and I
were talking.

252
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:36,121
Mm-hmm.

253
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:38,390
And Roy walked in
looking super angry.

254
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:41,126
And he's a big dude, you know?

255
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:42,093
And all of a sudden,

256
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,662
Jim pushed me out of the way.

257
00:11:43,664 --> 00:11:46,097
And Roy cocked his fist.

258
00:11:46,099 --> 00:11:50,135
Dwight sprays him
and knocks him on his butt.

259
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:55,140
Goodness.

260
00:11:55,142 --> 00:11:57,442
When I heard Jim and Pam
had kissed.

261
00:11:57,444 --> 00:11:59,477
My reaction was to have
lots of long talks

262
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,946
with Jim about our feelings.

263
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:03,948
Roy just attacked him.

264
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,018
I'm not sure which one
Jim hated more.

265
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,319
Let's get down to business.

266
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:09,921
Why don't you tell me

267
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:11,756
why you think you
deserve a raise.

268
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:15,226
Well, it's simple Mike. We merged
these two branches, right?

269
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:18,329
So now, we're shipping twice
as many orders as we used too.

270
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:20,665
With Roy gone,
we have a smaller crew,

271
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,600
and I'm picking up
all his slack.

272
00:12:22,602 --> 00:12:25,837
So, I think I should be compensated,
fairly, by getting a raise.

273
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,506
Those are very good points.

274
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:30,608
What?
I can't hear you.

275
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,577
Those are very good points.

276
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,846
I can't. What?
Mike, are you...

277
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,185
You make very
compelling arguments.

278
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:48,293
Sorry I almost got you killed.

279
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:50,095
Yeah.

280
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:51,663
That was nuts.

281
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:54,332
He could have broken your nose
or something.

282
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,401
Crazy.

283
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,139
It's just so stupid.

284
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:04,109
I mean, getting back
with Roy and everything.

285
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:06,978
I mean, what
was I thinking, right?

286
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,616
No, I mean, you guys really seem
to have a strong connection.

287
00:13:11,618 --> 00:13:13,251
Not anymore.

288
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:17,756
It's, um...
it's completely over now.

289
00:13:17,758 --> 00:13:19,724
We'll see.

290
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:21,126
I'm sure you guys'll...

291
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:23,695
find your way
back to one another someday.

292
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:25,230
Jim...

293
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,067
I am really... sorry.

294
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:31,469
Oh, yeah.
Don't worry about it.

295
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:37,075
I'm going to give you
a piece of paper.

296
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:39,778
I want you to write down
how much you want,

297
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,681
then I want you to slide it
back across the desk to me.

298
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:45,950
Why can't I just tell you?

299
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:49,554
Because, that is the way
these things are done.

300
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,389
In films.

301
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:56,928
No, slide... slide it, yes.

302
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,063
There you go.

303
00:14:00,866 --> 00:14:02,834
Oh...

304
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,536
Come on... be serious.

305
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,237
I am serious, Mike.
That's a 10% raise.

306
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,272
That's what I want.

307
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,606
I can't give you that.

308
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,542
I-I don't make this much.

309
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:11,943
Come on, be for real, Mike.

310
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:12,977
I don't.

311
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:15,013
I'll prove it to you.

312
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:18,449
There is a pay stub.

313
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:24,756
Are you serious?
You're earning this?

314
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:26,224
Plus perks, yes.

315
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:28,259
Mike, this is barely
more than I make.

316
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,828
You've been here ten years, dog.

317
00:14:31,598 --> 00:14:32,597
14 years.

318
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,698
Hoho!

319
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,233
No, please...
please don't...

320
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:38,136
Some of my folks got
to hear about this one.

321
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,704
Ah.

322
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:41,206
Okay, let's take 15 again.

323
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:44,909
A boss's salary
isn't just about money.

324
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:46,244
It is about perks.

325
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:48,646
It... for example,

326
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:51,583
every year,
I get a $100 gas card.

327
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:53,785
Can't put a price tag on that.

328
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:58,656
Okay, if you don't want a gift
at least let me buy you a beer,

329
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:00,325
or lunch or something.

330
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:01,993
When Han Solo returns
to the Death Star

331
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:03,595
in the Millennium Falcon,

332
00:15:03,597 --> 00:15:06,531
and shoots down the Tie Fighter
and saves the rebel cause...

333
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:09,567
Do you think he does so
for a free beer?

334
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:10,969
- Boy, I...
- No!

335
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:12,971
And why are you so interested
in buying me something, Jim

336
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,706
What's your angle?

337
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:19,110
It's like when he annoys me and I want
ot screw with him to get him back.

338
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:20,812
He never sees it coming.

339
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:23,548
But now I want to be nice to him
and actually give him something.

340
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,451
He's like an eel,
I just can't grab onto him.

341
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:28,419
It's infuriating.

342
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:31,289
Maybe you just feel
guilty about all the pranks.

343
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,860
Yes, that's probably what it is.

344
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:37,829
So, what do I do?

345
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:38,863
Hmm.

346
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:40,398
I don't know.
Maybe you should

347
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,167
go back out there and sell
paper, so we can go on a trip.

348
00:15:45,304 --> 00:15:46,271
Michael.

349
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:47,338
Hmm?

350
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,706
Here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.

351
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,208
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

352
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,576
I heard you might need it.

353
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:55,513
So... just take it.

354
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:57,115
Here's the $40 you gave me.

355
00:15:57,117 --> 00:15:59,150
I didn't give you $40.

356
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:01,252
In a way you did.

357
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:06,391
Yeah, I heard how much
Michael makes.

358
00:16:06,393 --> 00:16:09,527
I still think he's way overpaid.

359
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,297
14 years. 14.

360
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,799
I know.

361
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:18,603
Okay, I gotta go. Late.

362
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:20,738
Okay.

363
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,874
Okay, here's the straight dope.

364
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,842
No tricks, no Wikipedia.

365
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:25,777
What?

366
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:27,011
I talked to corporate,

367
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:28,746
and they told me

368
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:31,849
that I can only
give you a 5% raise.

369
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:33,017
That's 'cause of you, Mike.

370
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:34,218
They're not gonna give
the working man

371
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,620
more than the boss.

372
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:36,721
Well, what am I supposed to do?

373
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:38,456
Get your own raise.

374
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,892
You gotta get out there
and earn, son.

375
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:42,627
I'm not gonna go out
and ask for a raise right now.

376
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:44,095
That is ridiculous.

377
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:46,097
Well when they merged
the two branches together,

378
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:48,166
they put you in charge.

379
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,735
Okay, and we shippin' more now
than we ever have.

380
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:52,270
That's true.

381
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:55,340
You gotta call your girl...
and get paid.

382
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:57,742
Show her who wears the pants
in the relationship.

383
00:16:58,844 --> 00:17:00,545
You know what?
I should.

384
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:01,779
Yeah you should.

385
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:05,049
I have been an loyal
employee for a long time.

386
00:17:05,051 --> 00:17:06,784
14 years long.

387
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:08,386
You know what?
I deserve a bump.

388
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:09,821
Make it happen, Captain.

389
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,426
I am makin' it happen...
Sergeant.

390
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:19,430
I remember it was very late at
night, about 11:00 or 11:30

391
00:17:19,432 --> 00:17:22,333
Big fellow came in screaming
about God knows what,

392
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:25,937
I think maybe Halpert
had stolen his car.

393
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:29,507
The big fellow pulls out a sock
full of nickels.

394
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:32,844
Then Schrute grabs a can of
hairspray and a lighter.

395
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,812
You're useless.

396
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:40,685
We'll talk next month after
the quarter ends.

397
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,355
No, Jan.

398
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:47,458
I've never asked for a raise
in 14 years.

399
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,427
This is long overdue.

400
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:50,928
I wanna do it today.

401
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,063
Today? All right.

402
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:54,465
Well, if you want to
do it today...

403
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:58,269
We should do it in person
and can you get here by Five?

404
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:02,974
Yeah!
yeah, I'll leave right away.

405
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:05,743
Well, uh, listen,
because of our, uh, situation,

406
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:08,112
we're gonna need to have
a third party present.

407
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:10,214
Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.

408
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:11,883
D-Darryl
from the warehouse?

409
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:14,185
Mm-hmm.
No, Michael.

410
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:16,387
We... we need an H.R. rep.

411
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:19,157
So uh, you should
just bring Toby.

412
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:21,192
Hey... I'd rather
kill myself.

413
00:18:21,194 --> 00:18:23,127
Michael, he's your branch's
H.R. rep.

414
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:25,229
- Toby is terrible.
- And we need someone else in the room

415
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,665
- Toby is the worst human being
- because of our relationship.

416
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,500
- I've ever known... You know this.
- Michael!

417
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:31,736
Either Toby comes with you,
or we don't do it.

418
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,841
Fine.

419
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:39,277
- You are so mean.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

420
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,246
Yes you do, Ryan Bailey
Howard. You call me "stupid."

421
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,048
Toby, come on, let's go.

422
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,416
Where?
Where?

423
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:46,951
I'm gonna smack you in the head
with a hammer.

424
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:49,720
Come on, let's go.

425
00:18:49,722 --> 00:18:51,889
All right.

426
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,368
- Comfortable, Mike?
- Yeah.

427
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,071
- What about you? You comfortable?
- No.

428
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:14,812
Don't ever touch
a black man's radio!

429
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:16,948
Chris Tucker.
Rush Hour.

430
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,616
You know?

431
00:19:20,586 --> 00:19:22,854
I won't touch yours, by the way.

432
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,089
Thank you.
Well...

433
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:27,492
I haven't been to
New York in a long time.

434
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,529
Maybe I'll stay overnight.

435
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:33,564
Got a cousin live down there.

436
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,533
How would we get home?

437
00:19:35,535 --> 00:19:38,436
Oh, you could stay too.
He's got a big place.

438
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:41,405
- Maybe I'll stay.
- It's not that big.

439
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:44,475
The busses will get
ya home quick.

440
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,478
And then all of a sudden,
Dwight stood up

441
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,013
and was like, "No!"

442
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:50,748
Then what'd he do?

443
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,150
Well, you should just
read the report that Toby did.

444
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:53,417
He took everyone's stories.

445
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:57,655
Customer Service, this is Kelly.

446
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:02,026
Yes, I can help you with that.

447
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:03,961
Let me pull up your file.

448
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:09,600
Okay, it seems here that you
ordered 12,000 reams of paper.

449
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:11,369
Oh, 12 reams.

450
00:20:22,948 --> 00:20:23,881
Hey, guys.

451
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:27,685
Jan is ready for you.

452
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:28,886
Okay.

453
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:32,423
And don't forget the new
black man phrase I taught you.

454
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:33,958
Pippity poppity,
give me the zoppity.

455
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,427
Yes, sir!
Remember that.

456
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:37,962
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

457
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:39,630
All right.

458
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:45,436
I want him to get the raise.

459
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:46,837
I... just can't
help myself.

460
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:07,225
Hey, man, uh...

461
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:08,826
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,375
Thanks.

463
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,687
Can I, like...

464
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:38,856
see you after work
for coffee or something?

465
00:21:38,858 --> 00:21:41,292
I don't know.

466
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:43,894
Please.

467
00:21:43,896 --> 00:21:46,397
I just got some stuff
I gotta say to you.

468
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:55,940
Jim!

469
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:57,842
Roy.
Look out!

470
00:21:57,844 --> 00:22:00,544
Thanks, Kev.
I'm... good, though.

471
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,648
Thank you, Hunter.

472
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,717
Hello, come in.

473
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,458
Who's the boy toy?

474
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,926
My new assistant.

475
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:19,497
Were you going to tell me that
you hired James Van Der Beek

476
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,333
I have to call you when I get
a new assistant now?

477
00:22:22,335 --> 00:22:26,203
It would be nice to get a memo,
We are lovers.

478
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:28,272
Hi, Jan.

479
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,109
Hi, Toby.

480
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:39,250
First off, Michael,
this a salary negotiation.

481
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,085
All matters regarding
our personal relationship

482
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:42,586
have to be set aside.

483
00:22:42,588 --> 00:22:43,788
Are we clear?

484
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,256
Bippity boppity.

485
00:22:46,124 --> 00:22:48,759
Right now, we can
offer you a 6% raise.

486
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:50,561
6%?
Mm-hmm.

487
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:51,629
After all we've been through?

488
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:54,498
Oh, God.
I got you jade earrings.

489
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,634
- Michael...
- No. No.

490
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,803
No. You're gonna
play it like this?

491
00:22:58,805 --> 00:23:01,105
You give me a good raise,

492
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:03,274
or no more sex.

493
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:07,511
What are you writing,
perv-ball?

494
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,114
Just preparing
for the deposition.

495
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,249
This may be the first time
that a male subordinate

496
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,286
has attempted to get
a modest, scheduled raise

497
00:23:15,288 --> 00:23:18,456
by threatening to withhold sex
from a female superior.

498
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:21,225
It will be
a groundbreaking case...

499
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:23,461
when it inevitably
goes to trial.

500
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:27,365
I'm so sorry, Pammy.

501
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,233
I really wasn't
gonna do anything.

502
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:33,404
But then I... kept thinking
about you two together, and...

503
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:37,241
I just thought you guys
were really good friends or...

504
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:41,379
or maybe he was gay
or something.

505
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,447
Not that that's wrong.

506
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,419
I'm sorry too.

507
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:54,158
I just... I think that we
both made some bad choices.

508
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,302
So you gonna start
datin' Halpert, then?

509
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:08,305
Um... no.

510
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:10,174
No, he has a girlfriend.

511
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:12,209
Oh, yeah.

512
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:17,448
Wait a minute, you broke off
our wedding for the guy.

513
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,984
No.

514
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:23,154
There were a lot of reasons.

515
00:24:23,156 --> 00:24:26,357
You mean you're not even
gonna try to go out with him?

516
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:33,497
I don't get you, Pam.

517
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:35,466
I know.

518
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:44,208
What's this?

519
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,476
What's what?

520
00:24:45,478 --> 00:24:47,044
"Certificate of Bravery

521
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:48,412
"from the Scranton
Police Department.

522
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:51,282
"Recognizing
outstanding citizenship

523
00:24:51,284 --> 00:24:54,185
from a very brave young man,
Dwight K. Schrute"?

524
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:56,420
Wow, I guess word got around.

525
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:57,955
That's a nice honor.

526
00:24:57,957 --> 00:25:00,224
Please, they hand these
out to little kids.

527
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:03,661
Look, there's a teddy bear
in a policeman's cap.

528
00:25:03,663 --> 00:25:05,496
Mm... didn't think
you'd notice.

529
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:12,937
Why don't you just take that pen
and stab me in the heart.

530
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:15,339
This is me, Jan.
This is me!

531
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:18,542
Michael, why don't
we just take a break?

532
00:25:18,544 --> 00:25:20,077
Okay.

533
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,046
No, no, no, no.

534
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:24,515
You do not try tactic
number 8 on me.

535
00:25:24,517 --> 00:25:26,317
I invented tactic number 8.

536
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:29,553
Okay, Toby how about if you...
- Sure.

537
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:39,196
What's wrong with you?

538
00:25:39,198 --> 00:25:43,667
Ohh.
It was a weird day.

539
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,569
I accidentally
cross-dressed.

540
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:48,305
And then Darryl made me feel bad

541
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:50,674
for not making any money.

542
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,476
And then I had to ride up here
with stupid Toby.

543
00:25:52,478 --> 00:25:53,878
And then...

544
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,079
your assistant,

545
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:57,615
is all young and hot...

546
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:59,016
Okay, Michael...

547
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:02,453
I can offer you a 12% raise.

548
00:26:02,455 --> 00:26:03,387
But...

549
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,024
you have got to ask for 15.

550
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,593
That's ridiculous.
I'm never gonna make...

551
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:10,928
No, just...

552
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,797
I just need you to ask for it...

553
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,500
so I can record
that you asked for it.

554
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:18,068
'Kay?

555
00:26:18,837 --> 00:26:21,005
Ah, so...

556
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:28,646
All right, Levinson.

557
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:32,149
Here's the rub.

558
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:34,885
I would like a 15% raise.

559
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,854
No! But we can
offer you 12.

560
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,422
But you just said 15.

561
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:43,127
Negotiation is an art.

562
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:45,796
Back and forth, give and take.

563
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:49,900
And today, both Darryl and I
took something.

564
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:53,604
Higher salaries.
Win, win, win.

565
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:56,774
But, you know,
life is about more

566
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:58,943
than just salary.

567
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:02,146
It's about... perks.

568
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,348
Like having sex with Jan.

569
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,950
Michael!

570
00:27:23,668 --> 00:27:25,569
I've been doing some
very interesting reading.

571
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:27,304
Really?
Mm-hmm.

572
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:28,973
Tales of bravery.

573
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:30,274
Hmm. Good stuff?

574
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:32,376
Mm-hmm.

575
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:34,311
I was thinking tonight,
we could...

576
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:36,614
read it together.

577
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:38,582
That sounds...

578
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:40,884
fun.

579
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:59,269
I...

580
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:02,339
will never say a word.

581
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:05,409
And now... we are even.

582
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:11,415
I graduated from anger
management the same way

583
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:14,084
I graduated from Cornell... on
time.

584
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:16,220
Now I'm back,
got a second chance,

585
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:17,988
and I'm not gonna blow it.

586
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,024
So look out,
Dunder-Mifflin!

587
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,094
I mean "look out" in a fun way.

588
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:26,430
You know, not like,
"I'm gonna hurt you."

589
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:28,666
Hey, guys!

590
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,134
Guess who's back?

591
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:31,702
Aah! Aah!

592
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:35,372
Ohh, God!

593
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:36,907
No need to thank me.

594
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:39,076
I am not a hero.

595
00:28:39,078 --> 00:28:41,812
I am a mere defender of the
office.

596
00:28:41,814 --> 00:28:43,414
You know who's a real hero?

597
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,382
Hiro from "Heroes."

598
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:48,285
That's a hero.

599
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:49,753
Also Bono.
