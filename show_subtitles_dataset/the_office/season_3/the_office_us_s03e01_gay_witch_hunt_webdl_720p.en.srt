1
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:13,109
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.

2
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:14,977
I got Jim's, uh, old job.

3
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:17,180
Which means, at my ten-year
high school reunion,

4
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:19,615
it will not say,
"Ryan Howard is a temp."

5
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:22,718
It will say, "Ryan Howard
is a junior sales associate

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,888
at a mid-range
paper supply firm."

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,224
That'll show 'em.

8
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:47,210
You have no idea

9
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:49,846
how long I've wanted to do that.

10
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:51,714
Me too.

11
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:56,352
I think we're just drunk.

12
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:57,887
No, I'm not drunk.

13
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,889
Are you drunk?

14
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:01,824
No.

15
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:06,095
Jim.

16
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,000
You're really gonna marry him?

17
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:15,605
Okay.

18
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:24,814
Jim is gone.

19
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:28,417
He's gone.
I miss him so much.

20
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:31,787
Oh, I cry myself to sleep.
Jim.

21
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:34,757
False.
I do not miss him.

22
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:08,758
No, that is the fun
of this place.

23
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,459
I call everybody "faggy."

24
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:12,128
Why would anyone
find that offensive?

25
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,863
Okay, I think Oscar would
just like if you used "lame"

26
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:14,864
or something like that.

27
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,198
That's what "faggy" means!

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,067
No, not really.

29
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,736
Apparently you
called Oscar faggy.

30
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,171
Yeah.

31
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:23,739
For liking the movie
Shakespeare in Love

32
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,241
more than an action movie.

33
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:27,510
It wasn't just an action movie,
it was Die Hard.

34
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,645
All right, Michael,
but Oscar's really gay.

35
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:31,180
- Exactly.
- I mean for real.

36
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:32,281
Yeah, I know.

37
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:34,116
No, he's attracted to other men.

38
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:37,019
Okay, little too far.
Crossed the line.

39
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:41,857
Okay, I am telling you,
Oscar is an actual homosexual.

40
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:47,496
He told me this morning.

41
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:50,499
And obviously he hopes he can
count on your discretion.

42
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,735
I would've never called him that
if I knew.

43
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:53,836
You don't...

44
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:56,539
you don't call
retarded people retards.

45
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,374
It's bad taste.

46
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:01,877
You call your friends retards
when they're acting retarded.

47
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,082
And I consider Oscar a friend.

48
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,217
Listen, man, I am so sorry.

49
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,485
I had no idea.

50
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:11,520
Oh, it's fine.

51
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:13,022
It's okay, it's okay.
No, no, it's not.

52
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,523
I just...
I feel terrible about it.

53
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:15,658
I...

54
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,060
I have been calling people faggy

55
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,662
since I was in junior high,

56
00:03:19,664 --> 00:03:21,530
and I have never
made this mistake.

57
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,533
If I don't know how to behave,

58
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:29,138
it is because I am
just so far the opposite way.

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,873
You know?
I'm just...

60
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:34,010
I-I can't even imagine...
the... thing.

61
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:37,580
Maybe we could go out
for a beer sometime,

62
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,548
and you could tell me...

63
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,385
how you do that to another dude.

64
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:47,323
That sounds like
a great, wonderful idea.

65
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:48,724
Let's do that.

66
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:09,979
It explains so much.

67
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:12,181
No, I'm not gay.

68
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,783
And I don't understand

69
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:18,854
why anyone would think
that I'm gay if...

70
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:25,728
Uh...

71
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:29,065
Yeah, I'm gay.

72
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:34,470
I can't say whether
Dunder Mifflin paper

73
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:37,506
is less flammable, sir,
but I can assure you

74
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:39,341
that it is certainly
not more flammable.

75
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:41,544
Why did I transfer to Stamford?

76
00:04:41,546 --> 00:04:44,613
I... think that's
pretty obvious.

77
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:47,283
I got promoted.

78
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,185
And you can't beat that view.

79
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:50,286
Right?

80
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,288
Hey, Big Tuna.

81
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,256
You're single, right?

82
00:04:54,258 --> 00:04:55,991
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I am.

83
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:00,362
Pretty hot, huh?

84
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:04,433
She's completely crazy.

85
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:08,904
Steer clear, Big Tuna.

86
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:11,006
Head for open waters.

87
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:13,442
Okay.

88
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:15,010
Okay.

89
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:20,249
I ate a tuna sandwich
on my first day,

90
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,118
so Andy started calling me
Big Tuna.

91
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:27,957
I don't think any of them
actually know my real name.

92
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,427
Big Tuna is a super ambitious
guy, you know?

93
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,095
Cut-your-throat-to-get-ahead
type of guy.

94
00:05:33,097 --> 00:05:35,531
But, I mean,
I'm not threatened by him.

95
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:37,666
I went to Cornell.

96
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:40,035
You ever heard of it?

97
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,204
I graduated in four years,
I never studied once,

98
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:43,839
I was drunk the whole time,

99
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,208
and I sang in
the a cappella group,

100
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,044
"Here Comes Treble."

101
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:51,680
So, end of day,
we are going to have

102
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:53,883
a little diversity
policy freshener,

103
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,519
because of some more problems
at the Scranton branch.

104
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:59,155
And I have a list
of business startups

105
00:05:59,157 --> 00:06:00,523
I got from the Chamber.

106
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:01,757
Yes.

107
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,959
I am going to need someone
to cold call them.

108
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,594
Oh, I can do that.

109
00:06:07,063 --> 00:06:08,597
Jim's nice enough.

110
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,500
I don't... I don't know
how well he's fitting in here.

111
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:15,671
He's always looking
at the camera like this.

112
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:19,175
What is that?

113
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:20,910
Can you tell who's gay
and who's not?

114
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:21,977
Of course.

115
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,145
What about Oscar?

116
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:24,847
Absolutely not.

117
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:27,049
Well, he is.

118
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:31,854
Well, he's not dressed
in women's clothes, so...

119
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:34,523
There could be others.

120
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:35,858
I need to know.

121
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,093
I don't want to offend
anybody else.

122
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,962
You could assume everyone is,

123
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,731
and not say anything offensive.

124
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:43,966
Yeah.

125
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,267
I'm sure everyone
would appreciate

126
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,236
me treating them
like they were gay.

127
00:06:50,273 --> 00:06:51,674
Hey, what about Angela?

128
00:06:51,676 --> 00:06:53,175
She's hard and severe.

129
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:54,410
She could be a gay woman.

130
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:56,779
I really don't think so.

131
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:57,947
I don't know.

132
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,915
I can imagine her
with another woman.

133
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,650
Can't you?

134
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,422
Do some research.

135
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,990
Find out if there's
a way to tell

136
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,158
by just looking at 'em.

137
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,561
Jim told me you could
buy gaydar online.

138
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:14,296
That's ridiculous.

139
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,798
Yeah, probably.

140
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
He didn't tell the truth a lot.

141
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:21,036
Let's call him
and get the website.

142
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:22,104
Definitely.

143
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,839
What's gaydar?

144
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,374
Oh, oh, gaydar, yes!

145
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:28,110
No, uh, I think they have it
at Sharper Image.

146
00:07:28,112 --> 00:07:30,479
Oh, you know what?
I can check for you.

147
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:31,881
No problem.

148
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,086
It's sold out.

149
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:40,956
Yeah, sorry about that.
That's a bummer.

150
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,125
Well, they're sold out.

151
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:44,293
Damn.

152
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,861
I'll try Brookstone.

153
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,435
I miss that.

154
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,679
Chicken or fish?

155
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,948
Uh... chicken.

156
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:11,453
So, you, uh, having a good day?

157
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,289
Excellent.
Thanks.

158
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,791
Good.
I'm glad.

159
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:19,828
Okay.

160
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,701
Yeah, I didn't go through
with the wedding.

161
00:08:25,703 --> 00:08:28,337
I got cold feet
a few days before,

162
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,506
and...
I can't really explain it.

163
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:33,008
I just had to get out
of that relationship.

164
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,277
We still had to pay
for all the food.

165
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,912
So we froze it.

166
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,915
But I'm... I'm doing well.

167
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,750
I have my own apartment,

168
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,953
and I'm taking art classes,

169
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,189
and I have lunch
for the next five weeks.

170
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:50,292
After Pam dumped me, I, um...

171
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:53,095
I kinda stopped taking care
of myself for a while there,

172
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:54,630
and, uh...

173
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:56,665
I hit bottom when, uh...

174
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,233
I had a drunk driving arrest.

175
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,838
I've been working out,
and, um...

176
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,841
you know, I'm not
gonna take her for granted.

177
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:14,249
I gotta win her back.

178
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,085
I got them a toaster.

179
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:19,355
They called off the wedding
and gave the toaster back to me.

180
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:22,024
I tried to return the toaster
to the store,

181
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:24,893
and they said they no longer
sold that kind of toaster.

182
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:28,197
So now my house
has got two toasters.

183
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:35,137
It is so cool that you're gay.

184
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:37,139
I totally underestimated you.

185
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:41,243
Yes, I am super cool.

186
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:43,078
I am an accountant

187
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,848
at a failing
paper supply company.

188
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,483
In Scranton.

189
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:51,086
Much like, uh, Sir Ian McKellen.

190
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:57,192
Sure, sometimes I watch
Will & Grace.

191
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,128
And I want to throw up.

192
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,530
It's terribly loud.

193
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:06,001
I do like it sometimes,
when Harry Connick Jr. is on.

194
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:08,670
He's so talented.

195
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,355
Okay.

196
00:10:26,357 --> 00:10:28,791
Who put my calculator
in Jell-O?

197
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:33,762
Good one.

198
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,532
But, uh, seriously.

199
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:39,268
Guys, who did this?

200
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,572
Seriously, guys.

201
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,607
Who did this?

202
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,077
I need to know

203
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,546
who put my calculator
in Jell-O

204
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:54,083
or I'm gonna lose
my freakin' mind!

205
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,095
You know, it's amazing to me
that in this day and age,

206
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:08,697
you could be so... obtuse

207
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,499
about sexual orientation.

208
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,568
I watch The L Word, okay?

209
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,669
Good, good.

210
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:15,971
I watch Queer as.

211
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:17,139
So... That's not
what it's called.

212
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,373
Okay, Michael,

213
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,142
are you aware
that you outed Oscar today?

214
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:22,678
What?
What does that even...

215
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,614
Coming out
is a significant moment

216
00:11:25,616 --> 00:11:26,715
for a gay person.

217
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:27,983
And they should be allowed

218
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:30,486
to select the timing
and manner of announcing it.

219
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:32,354
Well, gay pride, right?

220
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:34,289
Gay pride parade?

221
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,192
It's not like...
Gay Shame Festival.

222
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:40,863
All right, now Oscar's feeling
discriminated against

223
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,931
by his coworkers,
primarily Angela,

224
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,133
and, um...

225
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:45,234
That's your fault.

226
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:47,369
I think Angela might be gay.

227
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:48,537
Could Oscar and Angela

228
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:49,872
be having a gay affair?

229
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,106
No...
Maybe.

230
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:52,841
Is that what this is about? No.

231
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:53,909
I don't...

232
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:55,244
No.
It's not possible.

233
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,945
Anything's possible.

234
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:59,748
Okay, you know, imagine...
you were gay.

235
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:03,485
Well, I'm not gay, Jan,

236
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:05,587
and you should know that
better than anybody.

237
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:06,889
Michael.
Hmm?

238
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:10,425
Your immaturity
is extremely disappointing

239
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:12,094
and may even lead to a lawsuit,

240
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,363
which is the absolute
last thing this company needs

241
00:12:14,365 --> 00:12:15,697
right now, do you understand?

242
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:16,832
I know.

243
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:20,469
The company has made it
my responsibility today

244
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:23,305
to put an end to 100,000 years

245
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:26,275
of being weirded out by gays.

246
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:28,510
Am I the first gay man
you ever knew?

247
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:30,646
Trick question.

248
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:32,781
Because you can't always tell,

249
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:34,516
so how would I know?

250
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:36,785
Was that the right answer?

251
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:39,788
Yep?
Michael...

252
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,191
Dwight's looking at gay
pornography on his computer.

253
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:43,625
Uh, Michael knows, Pam.

254
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,661
Okay, he asked me to do this
just for him.

255
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:47,596
He has his own reasons.

256
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:53,468
Phew, okay.

257
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,604
Nothing wrong with this stuff.

258
00:12:55,606 --> 00:12:57,673
At all.
This is fine.

259
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:58,840
You know what?

260
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:01,944
Gay porn, straight porn,
it's all good.

261
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,812
I don't particularly
get into this,

262
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:05,581
but, uh...

263
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,882
You know what?

264
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,617
I totally see the merit.

265
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:10,552
And, actually...

266
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:12,621
It is quite beautiful.

267
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:14,623
Oh, damn popups.
What are you doing?

268
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,425
Watching some of your friends.

269
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:17,726
This is stupid.

270
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,094
Excuse me.
Don't touch me.

271
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,729
Help! Ow.

272
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,764
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

273
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:24,333
Whoa, whoa.
Stop it.

274
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:25,934
All right, everybody
in the conference room.

275
00:13:25,936 --> 00:13:27,302
I don't care

276
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:31,573
if you are gay or straight
or a lesbian, or overweight.

277
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,642
Just get in here!
Right now!

278
00:13:34,444 --> 00:13:36,578
Did you know that "gay"

279
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,147
used to mean "happy"?

280
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,850
When I was growing up,
it meant "lame."

281
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:45,454
And now, it means a man

282
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:49,992
who makes love to other men.

283
00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:51,193
We're all homos.

284
00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:52,661
Homo sapiens.

285
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,863
Gays aren't necessarily
who you think they are, people.

286
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,031
What?

287
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,066
I mean, anybody can be gay.

288
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,568
Businessmen.

289
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,803
Like antique dealers,

290
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:03,972
or hairdressers,

291
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:06,575
or... accountants.

292
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:08,977
Oscar, why don't you

293
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:11,613
take this opportunity
to officially come out

294
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,348
to everybody here,

295
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,950
however you want to do it.

296
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:17,986
Go ahead.

297
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,821
Stand up.

298
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:21,657
I'm doing this for you.

299
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:25,627
Yes, I'm gay.

300
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,129
And...

301
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:29,831
I didn't plan on sharing
that part of my life

302
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,435
with you today, so...
whatever.

303
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:34,803
Can I sit down now?

304
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:37,639
I am not offended
by homosexuality.

305
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:41,243
In the '60s, I made love
to many, many women.

306
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,011
Often outdoors.

307
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:45,180
In the mud and the rain.

308
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:48,083
And it's possible
a man slipped in.

309
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:50,185
There would be no way
of knowing.

310
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:54,056
Who should be
the judges and juries

311
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,190
of our society?

312
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,692
Judges and juries.

313
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:59,528
Yes, that's a good point.
She has a good point.

314
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,930
Because gay marriage, currently,

315
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:04,700
is not legal
under U.S. law.

316
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:06,535
I bet a lot of straight men

317
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:08,637
wish that applied to them.

318
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,106
So they could go out there
and have some

319
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:13,041
torrid, unabashed, monkey sex.

320
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,376
As much as they could.

321
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:16,378
You know,
sounds pretty good, right?

322
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,679
That sounds great.

323
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:19,481
Yeah, Dwight?

324
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,683
I think all
the other office gays

325
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:24,252
should identify themselves,
or I will do it for them.

326
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:26,021
No one else in this office
is gay.

327
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:27,289
What about Phyllis?

328
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,725
She makes absolutely
no attempt to be feminine.

329
00:15:29,727 --> 00:15:32,127
I'm getting married
to Bob Vance.

330
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,695
You are?

331
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,197
Congratulations.

332
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,631
When did you get that?

333
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,766
That's great.

334
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:39,701
Congratulations, Phyllis.
That is great.

335
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:41,670
And frankly, kind of amazing.

336
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:44,439
See? Everybody has a chance.

337
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:45,841
Thank you.
But still,

338
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:47,142
Phyllis...

339
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,777
In college,

340
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,346
did you ever experiment
with other women?

341
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:52,748
A lot of women do.

342
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,950
No, and you knew me
in high school.

343
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:57,753
Of course, we all thought
you were gay in high school.

344
00:15:57,755 --> 00:16:00,188
Right.

345
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,424
Ha, ha!

346
00:16:03,993 --> 00:16:06,027
And I take that as a compliment.

347
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:08,330
Well, with your ties
and your matching socks...

348
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:10,499
Well, I just liked
to look good, okay, so...

349
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:11,767
You sound pretty defensive,
Michael.

350
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:12,768
No, I am just

351
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,403
coming out myself.

352
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:15,971
I am coming out hetero.

353
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,773
I think the problem
with this office

354
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,775
is that you
are sending mixed signals

355
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:20,942
about my being here.

356
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,077
No, no. No.

357
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,112
The only signal
that I am sending is,

358
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:25,514
"Gay good."

359
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:28,550
Look, if I was gay,

360
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:34,189
I would be the most flamboyant
gay you've ever seen.

361
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:37,125
I would be leading the parade
covered in feathers,

362
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:38,760
and just...

363
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:40,429
I'd be waving that rainbow flag.

364
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,766
I don't think
I can work here any longer.

365
00:16:44,768 --> 00:16:50,205
This has been the worst,
most backwards day of my life.

366
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,506
You misunderstand... okay.
All right.

367
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:52,741
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bop.

368
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:54,776
You know what?
Okay. Okay.

369
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:57,512
I, uh... I'm gonna put my money
where my mouth is.

370
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:58,914
You ready?

371
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,015
What are you doing?

372
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:01,249
I am going to embrace Oscar.

373
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:02,517
You might want
to watch this, Angela,

374
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,352
because you can't
catch anything.

375
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,754
- Here we go.
- No.

376
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:06,988
We are going
to make a statement.

377
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,724
You and I are going
to make a statement together.

378
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,726
Oscar is my friend.
I'd rather not.

379
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:13,795
And I just don't care
who sees it.

380
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:15,096
Doesn't bother me.

381
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:16,631
I really would... would...
I'd really rather not.

382
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,066
Come here, friend.
You're my friend.

383
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,868
No, no!

384
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,503
I don't want to touch you.

385
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:22,971
Ever considered that?

386
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:24,906
You're ignorant.

387
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:26,475
And insulting.
And small.

388
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:29,845
Okay.

389
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,151
All right.

390
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:40,222
Um...

391
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:41,590
I'm sorry, Michael.

392
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:43,725
Michael.
I'm sorry.

393
00:17:45,595 --> 00:17:47,529
That was a good idea.

394
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:48,597
Come on.

395
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,265
Come on.

396
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:53,001
All right.

397
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:55,904
I'm sorry
I called you "faggy."

398
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:58,406
I know, I know. I know you are.
You're not faggy.

399
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:00,008
- You're a good guy.
- You too.

400
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:03,011
Michael appears to be gay too.

401
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:06,248
And yet, he is my friend.

402
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,917
I guess I do have a gay friend.

403
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:11,820
You know what?
I'm gonna raise the stakes.

404
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:13,388
You don't...
really don't...

405
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,990
I want you to watch this.

406
00:18:14,992 --> 00:18:18,760
And I want you to burn this
into your brains.

407
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:22,931
- I don't think we need to...
- Because this is an image

408
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:25,500
that I want you people
to remember.

409
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:27,903
For a long time to come.

410
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,471
Whenever you come
into the office,

411
00:18:29,473 --> 00:18:31,439
I want you to think about this.

412
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,408
We don't need to...

413
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,709
Yes, we do.
What?

414
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:52,794
I did it.

415
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,896
Thank you.

416
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,031
Thank you.

417
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,066
See?

418
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,901
I'm still here.

419
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:02,604
We're all still here.

420
00:19:08,344 --> 00:19:09,744
Oh, come on, Dwight!

421
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:10,845
Come on, man!

422
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,747
We are not
in the playground anymore.

423
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:14,649
There are new rules.

424
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:20,021
We have to be mature,
but we can't lose the spirit

425
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:22,891
of childlike wonder.

426
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:26,394
What is love, anyway?

427
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:30,231
Maybe it's supposed
to break all the rules.

428
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:32,233
Like me and Jan.

429
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:35,337
Or Oscar and some guy.

430
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:36,738
Life is short.

431
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,341
When two people find each other,

432
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:42,377
what should stand in their way?

433
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:45,046
It is very easy for you
to be a hero.

434
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:48,249
All you need are honesty,
empathy, respect,

435
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:49,451
and open-mindedness.

436
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,654
I'm glad today spurred
social change.

437
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:54,923
That's part of my job
as regional manager.

438
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:56,925
But you know what,
even if it didn't,

439
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,127
at least we put this matter
to bed.

440
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:02,063
That's what she said.

441
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:03,865
Or he said.

442
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:09,804
Oh, there's Gil,
Oscar's roommate.

443
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:18,146
I wonder if he knows.

444
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:21,583
I was going to quit,
but Jan offered me

445
00:20:21,585 --> 00:20:24,886
a three-month paid vacation
and a company car.

446
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:28,590
All I had to do was sign
something saying I won't sue.

447
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,592
Gil and I are going to Europe.

448
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:35,096
Kids, sometimes
it pays to be gay.

449
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:41,670
"I hope this helps.

450
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:43,138
Jim."

451
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:51,846
Nice.

452
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:54,182
What are you doing?
Shh.

453
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,784
Don't be scared.

454
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:04,693
It works.

455
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:12,400
Oh, no.
