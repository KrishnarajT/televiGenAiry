1
00:00:00,761 --> 00:00:01,794
Hello, son.

2
00:00:01,796 --> 00:00:02,995
If you're watching this,

3
00:00:02,997 --> 00:00:05,131
that means I'm already dead.

4
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:06,966
Life is a road...

5
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:09,135
How do you know it's gonna be a boy?
How...

6
00:00:09,137 --> 00:00:10,569
Would you stop interrupting,
please?

7
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:13,072
Yesterday,
I was scraping some gunk

8
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:15,307
off my wall sockets
with a metal fork,

9
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:18,711
and I gave myself
the nastiest shock.

10
00:00:18,713 --> 00:00:20,546
And when I came to,

11
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:22,248
I had an epiphery.

12
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:26,652
Life is precious.

13
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:28,554
And if I die,

14
00:00:28,556 --> 00:00:32,424
I want my... son...

15
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:36,862
to know the dealio.

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,631
The dealio of life.

17
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,666
Here are some things
that I want to teach you

18
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:42,168
that your mother
won't be able to.

19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,037
To jump-start a car,
first pop the hood.

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,339
Then you take these bad boys

21
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:50,709
and clip them
anywhere on the engine.

22
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:53,679
Then, you take these,

23
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:56,515
and clip them wherever.

24
00:00:58,585 --> 00:00:59,852
Number eight.

25
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:01,420
Learn how to take off
a woman's bra.

26
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:03,255
What? We will
demonstrate on Pam.

27
00:01:03,257 --> 00:01:04,290
No.
And...

28
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,624
No.
Come on.

29
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:07,593
You just twist your hand,

30
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:09,228
until...

31
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,463
something breaks.

32
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:12,598
Ow.

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,966
Well, you get the picture.

34
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:15,534
Thanks, Pam.

35
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:18,537
And remember, no matter what,

36
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:20,105
I will always love you.

37
00:01:20,107 --> 00:01:21,173
What if he's a murderer?

38
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:23,375
He's not gonna be a murderer.

39
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,477
Maybe that's how you die.
You know what?

40
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,180
Dwight,
do you want to do this or no?

41
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:30,649
I want to do this.
Okay.

42
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:32,651
From the top.
Ready?

43
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:34,220
3...
Action.

44
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:56,408
Hello, everyone.

45
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,277
As you know,

46
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,212
we are six days away

47
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:01,814
from Phyllis's wedding.

48
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,917
So get your suits
to the dry cleaners,

49
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,018
and get your hair did.

50
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,586
And Karen, um...

51
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:09,388
you might want to invest
in a... a dress

52
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,056
or a skirt of some kind

53
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:12,892
if you don't already have one.

54
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:14,326
This may be Phyllis's

55
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:15,861
only wedding ever.

56
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:17,196
It's my job to ensure

57
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:18,797
that none of you
look like ragamuffins.

58
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:22,468
So... I am instituting

59
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,670
primae noctis.

60
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:26,672
Primae noctis,

61
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:28,507
I believe
from the movie Braveheart,

62
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,876
and confirmed on Wikipedia,

63
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,247
is when the king
got to deflower every new bride

64
00:02:35,249 --> 00:02:37,016
on her wedding night.

65
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:40,419
So...

66
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:42,821
I'm sorry.
I...

67
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:44,690
had a very different
understanding

68
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,558
as to what primae noctis meant.

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,495
I'm trying to get everyone
excited about Phyllis's wedding,

70
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:50,996
because I want her

71
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:53,032
to get people excited
about my wedding,

72
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,366
when the time comes.

73
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:55,701
Which won't be hard.

74
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:57,069
Because it's gonna be awesome.

75
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,771
A lot better than hers,
that's for sure.

76
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:00,706
It'll probably be on a boat.

77
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,807
What's up,

78
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,042
spinstas?

79
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:04,209
Nothing.

80
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,678
You know, this
is a luncheon shower.

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,712
Girls only.

82
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:08,113
No problem.

83
00:03:08,115 --> 00:03:09,181
The guys are having

84
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:11,283
a little shindig of their own

85
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:12,651
in the warehouse.

86
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:14,386
From 2:30 to 3:15.

87
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:17,222
It is the only time
that Bob was available.

88
00:03:17,224 --> 00:03:18,791
Sort of a guys' night out.

89
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:20,492
A G-N-O, if you will.

90
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,927
A g-no.

91
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:24,496
Actually, it's more
of a guys' afternoon in.

92
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:26,131
A G-A-I.

93
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,199
A gai.

94
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:29,301
Not...

95
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:31,303
Not... it's, uh...
not gay.

96
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:33,639
It's a, just a...

97
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,075
It's a bridal shower for guys.

98
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:37,743
A guy shower.

99
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,979
An hour-long shower
with guys.

100
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:49,588
I guess Jim and I

101
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,623
have had a little bit
of a rough patch

102
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,392
for the past couple weeks,

103
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,260
but we had
some really good talks.

104
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:56,795
And actually,

105
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:59,098
now I think
that we're better than ever.

106
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,770
Karen and I
had a long... talk last night.

107
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:06,772
And the night before that.

108
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:08,374
And, uh...

109
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:09,641
Every night...

110
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:13,812
for the last five nights.

111
00:04:25,692 --> 00:04:28,627
Something's up
with Jim and Karen.

112
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,163
Not that I've been
eavesdropping.

113
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:33,265
It's not really
any of my business.

114
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:35,901
But...
I've gotten pretty good

115
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:38,303
at reading
the back of Jim's neck.

116
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:40,272
Halpert!

117
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:43,008
Tall, queer, handsome as ever.

118
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,576
"Hey, everybody, it's me.

119
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:47,112
Jim."

120
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:49,314
Hello, hello.

121
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:51,016
Todd Packer.

122
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:52,184
Karen Filipelli.

123
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:53,218
Jim's girlfriend.

124
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,386
Shut up!

125
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:55,754
Yep.
Shut it!

126
00:04:55,756 --> 00:04:57,389
That's rude.

127
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:58,891
Either this chick is a dude,

128
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:01,226
or Halpert got scared straight!

129
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:02,461
Yes, yes.

130
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:03,796
Oh ho!
Yes.

131
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:04,930
Oh ho ho ho ho.

132
00:05:04,932 --> 00:05:06,565
There... uh!

133
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,733
What happened?

134
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,736
Quick, somebody help!

135
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:13,739
Help the man!
Ow, no, no!

136
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:15,774
I can't believe
you're not going to be there.

137
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:17,009
It's gonna be good.

138
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:19,611
It's gonna be
a great bachelor party, man.

139
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:21,480
I have a full day
of sales calls.

140
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:22,514
You should get out of them.

141
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:23,782
I can't.

142
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:26,318
It's... it's the only time
he can do it.

143
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,587
2:30 to 3:15.

144
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:30,322
It's gonna be great.

145
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:31,623
We're going to be doing
some darts,

146
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,725
we're gonna be, uh,
grilling up some steaks.

147
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:35,928
I got some pie...

148
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,363
Going to be very delicious...

149
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:41,033
And what kind of stripper
did you get?

150
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:44,636
I did not order a stripper.

151
00:05:44,638 --> 00:05:46,071
Whaddaya mean,
you didn't order a stripper?

152
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:48,140
Have you ever even been
to a bachelor party?

153
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:49,675
Yeah.

154
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:53,045
Um...

155
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:56,181
Not personally, no.

156
00:05:56,183 --> 00:05:58,083
All right, Mike.
Okay?

157
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,319
A stripper
is Bachelor Party 101.

158
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:01,920
I know, I... If you
don't get a stripper,

159
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:03,188
your party is gonna suck.

160
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,057
I can't get a stripper here.

161
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:06,291
Sexual harassment.

162
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,628
I just...
Get one for the girls, too.

163
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,729
That evens it out.

164
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:11,964
You know, separate but equal.

165
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:14,700
So that's what that means.

166
00:06:14,702 --> 00:06:16,969
Okay, everybody.
Slight change of plans.

167
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,238
We are still going to be
having two parties,

168
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,806
but each is going to get

169
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,541
a little extra dose
of naugh-tay.

170
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:23,675
Unh!

171
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,077
All right!

172
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:27,012
Unh!
Gay...

173
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:28,680
What?

174
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:30,415
Okay, co-ed naked strippers
in this office.

175
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:31,917
For realsies.

176
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,352
Under no circumstance
should a man

177
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,654
strip off his clothes
in this office.

178
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,022
Shut up, Angela!

179
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,928
Hey.

180
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,630
Hey.

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,433
Uh...

182
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:49,935
Uh...

183
00:06:49,937 --> 00:06:51,603
Everything okay?

184
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:53,005
Oh, yeah.

185
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,173
Why?

186
00:06:54,175 --> 00:06:56,975
Well, you seem a little tired.

187
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:59,111
Oh.

188
00:06:59,113 --> 00:07:00,879
Yeah, well...

189
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:04,116
I guess there's been
a couple of late nights.

190
00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:07,219
Karen and I
have been up talking.

191
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:10,722
You should get more sleep.

192
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:12,424
Yeah.

193
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:13,959
I know I should.

194
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:16,395
Never underestimate the power
of a good night's sleep.

195
00:07:16,397 --> 00:07:18,197
No, I'm sure you're right.

196
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,832
When I get eight hours,
compared to, like, six hours...

197
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:23,135
it's like, big difference!

198
00:07:23,137 --> 00:07:24,303
Really?

199
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:25,971
Oh, yeah.

200
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:28,173
Gotta get your REM cycle.

201
00:07:28,175 --> 00:07:30,442
Going with the whole...

202
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:32,878
sleeping...

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,813
better than not.

204
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:37,616
Good advice, Beesly.

205
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:39,218
Thanks.
See you out there?

206
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,587
Yeah.

207
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,889
Don't fall asleep at your desk.

208
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:46,091
Oh, my God.

209
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,859
Okay.
We are off.

210
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:50,796
Ryan and I are going to go
get some supplies.

211
00:07:50,798 --> 00:07:54,600
And I need you to handle...

212
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:56,134
hiring the strippers.

213
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:57,669
Absolutely not.

214
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:58,804
I'm on it.

215
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:00,606
Well, get on it,
and make it happen.

216
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,641
Ruddy cheeks, thick calves,

217
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:04,509
no tats, no moles.

218
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:06,211
No tats.

219
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:08,113
No, tats.

220
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:09,514
Of course I want...
Stop.

221
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:11,049
That's disgusting.
Leave me alone

222
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:12,684
and get the male stripper.
Fine.

223
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,219
I knew you would, Nancy.

224
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:15,554
Sally.

225
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:17,356
Uh... no preference.

226
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:19,691
Uh, what do you think,
a redhead or brunette?

227
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:21,760
Blonde.

228
00:08:21,762 --> 00:08:24,563
Nice.

229
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:27,633
Do you have any blonde women?

230
00:08:29,102 --> 00:08:30,602
Hmm.

231
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,207
He hasn't even said a word yet.

232
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:36,775
Just giggling.

233
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:43,248
Gotcha.

234
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:50,722
- Yes?
- You okay?

235
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:52,357
I'm in the...
I'm in the sex shop.

236
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,625
Ah, gotcha.

237
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:57,029
Okay, so they have
Albert Einstein,

238
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:58,930
Ben Franklin,
or SpongeBob SquarePants.

239
00:08:58,932 --> 00:09:00,332
SquarePants?

240
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,267
Yep, SpongeBob SquarePants.

241
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,636
And you think that'd be sexy?

242
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:05,804
Michael referred me

243
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:09,675
to a male strip club
called Banana Slings.

244
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:11,376
Instead, I called

245
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,745
the Scholastic Speakers
of Pennsylvania.

246
00:09:13,747 --> 00:09:14,880
Ooh, ha ha!

247
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:16,248
Hold the door, please!

248
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,749
Oh.
Thank you.

249
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:19,151
Ho ho. Hello.

250
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:20,419
Hello.

251
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,920
You wearing a thong?

252
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,422
What?

253
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,361
Sparkling cider is very good.

254
00:09:29,363 --> 00:09:30,696
I think that's champagne.

255
00:09:30,698 --> 00:09:33,765
Hello, ladies.

256
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:36,134
Who here is a history buff?

257
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:37,936
Um...

258
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:39,838
Who's a fan of buff naked?

259
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,443
Without further ado, the one,

260
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:46,478
the only...

261
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,447
the sexy
Mr. Benjamin Franklin.

262
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:52,417
Thank you for that introduction,
Mr. Scott.

263
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:55,487
And good afternoon,
fine gentlewomen

264
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:57,723
of Dunder-Mifflin.

265
00:09:57,725 --> 00:09:58,924
Huh?

266
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,326
Half pants, right,
Mr. Franklin?

267
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:03,228
Knickers, in fact, yes.

268
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,296
He's in his knickers.

269
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:06,331
Mr. Franklin.

270
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,532
Hmm?
I would say

271
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:10,769
you were probably one of
the sexiest presidents ever.

272
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:14,005
Well, actually,
I never was president.

273
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:16,475
Yes, but Ben Franklin was.

274
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,344
Ah.

275
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:21,913
I am here to teach you
a little bit

276
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,015
about my life.

277
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:25,917
And the era
of the Founding Fathers.

278
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,622
And when they came over
on the Mayflower.

279
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:33,325
Bow-chicka-bow.

280
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:35,227
Wait.

281
00:10:35,229 --> 00:10:36,461
This is the entertainment?

282
00:10:36,463 --> 00:10:37,796
Yeah.
All right.

283
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:41,066
So I want you to give him
your undivided attention,

284
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,134
and Mr. Franklin...
Hmm?

285
00:10:42,136 --> 00:10:44,503
If any of these ladies
misbehave,

286
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:46,705
I give you permission
to spank them.

287
00:10:46,707 --> 00:10:48,039
Especially that one.

288
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:55,147
Have you ever
seen a stripper before?

289
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,515
Yes.

290
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:58,483
Jennifer Garner
portrayed one on Alias.

291
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:00,285
It was one of her many aliases.

292
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:01,353
Yeah.

293
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,654
Me neither.
Hey.

294
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:04,122
Hi.
I'm Elizabeth.

295
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:05,891
I'm the dancer
that was requested.

296
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:07,893
Okay. Ha.

297
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:10,662
I specifically ordered
a stripper.

298
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:12,364
I'm the stripper.

299
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:13,965
Oh.
Okay, good.

300
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,468
Well, in future, please
identify yourself as such.

301
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,270
Oh, God.
Okay...

302
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,172
"Is she hot?"

303
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:27,479
Text back,
"Kind of."

304
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:32,951
It was a warm June evening
in 1752,

305
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,920
the night of my fateful
kite flight.

306
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:36,121
Mr. Franklin.
Yes?

307
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:37,656
Do you have a girlfriend?

308
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:39,858
I have a lovely wife.
Deborah.

309
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,461
But don't you also
have girlfriends in Paris?

310
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,695
Mm.

311
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:44,930
Like, a lot of them?

312
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:46,164
Ah, well, that

313
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,800
is a gray area of my life.

314
00:11:48,802 --> 00:11:50,635
Okay? So.

315
00:11:50,637 --> 00:11:52,804
It was a warm June evening...

316
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,673
Look at that.

317
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:58,143
Nothing like grilling
in the great outdoors.

318
00:11:58,145 --> 00:12:01,313
Is this the same grill
you grilled your foot on?

319
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:03,381
No.

320
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:04,649
Yes.

321
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:06,551
Oh, gross. But I got all
the foot off of it.

322
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:09,154
Mm...
Okay, Ben Franklin.

323
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:11,223
Ah... aha!

324
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:14,860
Oh, Ben Franklin
tied a cherry stem in his mouth!

325
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:16,995
Well, that is because
I am a Renaissance man.

326
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:17,996
Ben Franklin?

327
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,098
Hmm?
Do you wear boxers,

328
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,399
briefs, or pantaloons?

329
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:23,768
Well.

330
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,937
You're very saucy.

331
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,110
Guys! Beef!

332
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:34,145
It's what's for dinner.

333
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,248
Who wants some man meat?

334
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,582
I do.
I want some man meat.

335
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:39,017
Michael,

336
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,552
Dwight would like your man meat.

337
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:42,687
Well, then,
my man meat he shall have.

338
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:44,990
There you go.

339
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:47,225
Deliciousity.

340
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:48,326
Of course.

341
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,395
There we go.

342
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:53,265
So I guess you have
the Ben Franklin wig,

343
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:54,833
and the costume, and you figure,

344
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:56,701
"How could I put this
to practical use?"

345
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,169
Well, I like to think
that his dad

346
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,905
was a Ben Franklin impersonator.

347
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:02,807
And he really
pressured him into it.

348
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:06,845
Hey, um,
I wanted to talk to you.

349
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:08,947
I-I know this is weird
or whatever,

350
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:10,181
but, um...

351
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:12,584
Jim told me about you guys.

352
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:14,786
What do you mean?

353
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,354
Well, that you kissed.

354
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:19,024
And we've talked it through,
and it's totally fine.

355
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,992
It's not a big deal.

356
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:23,061
It was just a kiss.

357
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,164
Wait, you're not still...

358
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,365
interested in him?

359
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,967
Oh, yeah.

360
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,236
Really.

361
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:33,672
Oh, no.

362
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,607
I'm... I was confused
by your phrasing.

363
00:13:35,609 --> 00:13:37,909
You should definitely
go out with Jim.

364
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:39,411
I mean,
you're going out with Jim.

365
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:40,779
I'm not going out with Jim.

366
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,180
You're dating him.

367
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:43,315
Which is awesome,

368
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:44,816
because you guys
are great together.

369
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:46,685
'Kay.

370
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:48,887
I'm not into Jim.

371
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:50,088
Yeah.

372
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,991
So, um... we're good.

373
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:55,327
Yeah.

374
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:56,761
Sorry.

375
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:59,197
What are you sorry about?

376
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,766
Um...

377
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:02,968
What?

378
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,369
What are you sorry about?

379
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:05,971
Nothing.

380
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:08,640
I was just thinking
of something else.

381
00:14:08,642 --> 00:14:12,143
Okay, the game is no-limit,
deuce to 7 lowball.

382
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:14,012
Blinds 25-50.

383
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:15,981
Nickels are worth 10, dimes 25,

384
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,182
and quarters 50.

385
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,316
Nothing wild.

386
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:19,751
Michael shuffle!

387
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:21,519
Here we go.

388
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,925
Michael...

389
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:30,495
Ah.
Gentlemen...

390
00:14:30,497 --> 00:14:32,597
The entertainment is here.

391
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,832
Everybody,
I'd like to introduce you

392
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:35,533
to Elizabeth.

393
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:36,801
Hi, guys.

394
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:38,203
Nice outfit.

395
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:40,839
I hear there's
an important meeting here.

396
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:44,976
I'm not really into strippers.

397
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:46,578
And... you know
what I find sexy?

398
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,446
Pam's art.

399
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:49,614
She's an artist.

400
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:52,017
And I appreciate that.

401
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:53,885
It's very moving.

402
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:56,221
And... sexy.

403
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:58,556
The art.

404
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:00,525
Hit it.

405
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,364
So where's the groom?

406
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,166
Oh.
He is right there.

407
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:09,701
There he is.

408
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:10,769
Absolutely not.

409
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:12,203
That's all you.

410
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,204
It's all you.

411
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:15,440
Okay.

412
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:16,941
All right, I'll do it.

413
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,777
Yeah, let's do it.

414
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:19,944
Let's do this thing.

415
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:21,312
Yeah?

416
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:23,081
What do I...
Just sit on down.

417
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,716
All right.
All right.

418
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:26,051
Okay.
And here we go.

419
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:27,852
Oh, here we go.
All right.

420
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,220
Yes.
Whoo!

421
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:32,223
Not bad, not bad.

422
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:34,192
You smell nice.
Like Tide.

423
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,794
Mm, what's that?

424
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:37,762
You smell like Tide detergent.

425
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,731
Do you use

426
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,066
Tide detergent?

427
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:44,402
Ha ha!

428
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:46,204
Whoo!

429
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:47,839
I have a girlfriend, so...

430
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,275
I bet she'd be jealous.

431
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,210
Yeah, she'd probably...

432
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,112
Yes, she would be.

433
00:15:54,114 --> 00:15:55,480
You know what?
Okay. Excuse me.

434
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:57,716
This... please.
Stop it, stop it.

435
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:58,783
Turn off the music.
This is wrong.

436
00:15:58,785 --> 00:15:59,784
This is wrong!

437
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:00,885
This is wrong.

438
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,789
I have a girlfriend.

439
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,224
Uh-uh.

440
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:07,459
And you are engaged,

441
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:08,493
and I'm sure you have

442
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:10,428
a boyfriend
in prison or something,

443
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,696
so...

444
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:13,364
Let's just clear out, okay?

445
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:14,999
Shame on you.

446
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:18,770
Go back to work!

447
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:23,475
Elizabeth, I want you
to sit here.

448
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:24,976
When the phone rings, answer it.

449
00:16:24,978 --> 00:16:27,378
You want me to answer phones

450
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,847
with my clothes on?

451
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:31,249
We hired you
for three hours' work.

452
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,751
And we're gonna get it.

453
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,390
Ooh, I love your poster.

454
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,761
Thank you.

455
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,240
You know,
I invented electricity.

456
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:57,075
I know.

457
00:16:57,077 --> 00:16:58,143
Well, I'm sensing

458
00:16:58,145 --> 00:16:59,811
a little electricity right here.

459
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:02,947
Didn't Ben Franklin
have syphilis?

460
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,584
Yes, but I don't.

461
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:08,620
My name is Gordon.

462
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:11,189
Oh.

463
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:13,057
On one hand,
I want to be honest with Jan

464
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:14,125
and tell her the truth.

465
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,293
But on the other hand,

466
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,694
I'm afraid she's gonna dump me.

467
00:17:16,696 --> 00:17:18,730
You know, Michael,

468
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:21,199
I fathered an illegitimate son.

469
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:22,767
Really.
But I kept all this

470
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:24,736
from my wife, Deborah.

471
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:27,839
These things only serve
to upset the women.

472
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:30,275
They are the gentler sex.

473
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:33,244
Wow.

474
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:34,479
Ben Franklin,

475
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:36,681
you're really
kind of a sleazebag.

476
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:41,586
Stripper?

477
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:43,121
Could I ask you a question?

478
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:45,657
About women?

479
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,225
Um...

480
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:50,695
Should I tell my girlfriend
that you danced up on me?

481
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:57,468
Secret secrets are no fun.

482
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,605
Secret secrets hurt someone.

483
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:05,143
Wow.

484
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,845
Thank you.

485
00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:11,349
Care for a piece of chocolate?

486
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:12,450
Chocolate!

487
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:13,751
Where did you acquire it?

488
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:15,587
That is a delicacy
in the Amazon,

489
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:17,055
but it has not yet been imported

490
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:18,523
to the United States.

491
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,925
Who was the king of Austria?
Joseph II.

492
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,961
Who was the king of Prussia?
Friedrich Wilhelm III.

493
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:24,229
Who was the king of England?

494
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:26,731
Why, the tyrant King George,
of course.

495
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:28,233
I don't care what Jim says.

496
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:30,802
That is not
the real Ben Franklin.

497
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:33,638
I am 99% sure.

498
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,840
Michael, I left a meeting.

499
00:18:35,842 --> 00:18:37,442
What is so urgent?

500
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:41,246
Are you... are you okay?

501
00:18:41,248 --> 00:18:42,680
Not really.

502
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:44,749
Look, I don't know
how to say this,

503
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:46,117
so I just will.

504
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,151
Okay.

505
00:18:47,153 --> 00:18:49,520
I, um...

506
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:51,956
went to a bachelor party.

507
00:18:53,158 --> 00:18:57,095
And things got
a little out of hand.

508
00:18:57,097 --> 00:19:00,265
Uh, when... when did...
When, last night?

509
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,900
No, today at work.

510
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:03,868
You went to a bachelor party
at work?

511
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,937
Yes, I kind of arranged it.

512
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:08,139
Well, I don't even think
the stripper was that hot.

513
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:09,974
Do... do you guys
think she was hot?

514
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,175
Kelly, don't do this.

515
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:12,443
Do what?
I just asked you a question.

516
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:13,778
You know what you're doing.

517
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,913
Anyway, you know who was

518
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,314
totally flirting
with Ben Franklin?

519
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:18,049
Pam.

520
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,417
Really?

521
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:21,252
Looks like I hired
the right guy.

522
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:22,387
I'm glad.

523
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:23,988
Any real potential there,
Beesly?

524
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:27,125
Yeah. Right.

525
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,594
God, I need a boyfriend.

526
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:31,629
Um...

527
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:33,765
You know, Ryan,
I'm... I'm totally ready

528
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:36,167
to be set up with one of
your business school friends.

529
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:37,435
Whenever.

530
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:38,770
'Kay.

531
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:42,340
Oh, my God.

532
00:19:42,342 --> 00:19:44,909
I would get so fat if I worked here.
Yeah?

533
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:46,978
I lose my appetite all the time.

534
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:49,714
You could strip, you know.

535
00:19:49,716 --> 00:19:52,083
Thanks.

536
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:53,751
So you don't want
to end our relationship?

537
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:55,420
I'm closer to firing you.

538
00:19:55,422 --> 00:19:57,889
That is so sweet.

539
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,425
You are the best
cheated girlfriend in the world.

540
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:01,626
Do you know that?

541
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:02,827
You are.
I'll talk to you later.

542
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,195
You are.

543
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:07,498
So you know who turned out
to be kind of a creep?

544
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,101
Ben Franklin.

545
00:20:10,103 --> 00:20:12,670
And...
Elizabeth, the stripper?

546
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:14,305
Gave me great advice.

547
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:16,140
Which rhymed.

548
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,878
Really makes you wonder
how Ben Franklin

549
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,246
can become president,

550
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:24,983
but someone
like Elizabeth can't.

551
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:29,754
Are you nearsighted
or farsighted?

552
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:32,724
That's why I invented the bifocals.
Gaah!
